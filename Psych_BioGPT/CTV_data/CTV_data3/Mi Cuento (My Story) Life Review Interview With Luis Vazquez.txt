Presents Mi Cuento (My Story): Life Review Interview 

00:00:00
with Luis Vazquez (Interview by Allen Ivey) 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  I'm Allen Ivey of Microtraining Associates and I have something very special to share with you today, Dr. Luis Vasquez of New Mexico State University. Luis has a fascinating family background. This is the third of our series on perspectives of people living in the United States and I think it also has implications for Canada. We have a series on African-Americans, a series on Jewish-Americans and now we're going to have one discussing what it's like to be a Latino in America. I think this is an important material and I hope you get a lot out of it. I do wanna say a little bit about my role in this. My role basically is to stay out of the way and to listen to Luis' story 'coz the story is what this is all about. A narrative of his experience is what's important. I think you're gonna learn a lot about culture from individuals and this is a very interesting and important individual for us all to learn from, especially me. Now, while(ph) I work with Luis, I'm going to basically focus on different life stages, following roughly an Eriksonian, Erik Erikson's life framework but with little, with a few variations. I'm basically going to ask him to tell a little bit about each stage of his life but one thing I'm gonna throw in at some point is, ah, variation and I'm going to ask him, as he tells his life story also to focus on some strengths that he got throughout his life which brought him where, to where he is. Along with that, I'm going to ask him for an image of his strengths and a story that goes with that. Life stories need to be, sometimes it focus a lot of negatives. As you work with a client during a life review always make sure that you find something positive to work with. Okay, so Luis, thank you so much for being here. I feel honored, ah, I really do feel honored to hear your story and to help you share it or, as I said, to try to stay out of your way as we, as we work on this. And I think the place we might really begin is at the beginning, from your childhood. I'd like to, a little about your father, mother, perhaps you might even wanna start with your grandparents so we could have, get a context for your particular life. Is that okay? 

00:03:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Oh, sure, sure, thank you. (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
ALLEN IVEY You take it however if you want it. 

00:03:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, I suppose start off when my parents first came here from Puerto Rico. 

00:03:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:03:15
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ They, my father came back in, ah, in the late '40s. Now, back in Puerto Rico he, he went up to seventh grade and my mother went up to fourth grade and, uhm, they both worked quite a bit. My father worked in the sugarcane fields and then my mother, uhm, they took her out of fourth grade to help her mother cook for many of the, of the sugarcane owners and, and so forth, other plantations there. That in '48 they decided that, ah, the United States decided that they could have contract migrant workers, that they could bring Puerto Ricans or from the island to come and do the migration route, going from New York to the various states all the way back to Florida, picking different crops throughout the way. Now, when my father, uhm, now he has a very in, interesting stor, story. When he left Puerto Rico, he spoke very little, if any, English at all and when he became a contract migrant worker, well, back in Puerto Rico he made, uhm, 75 cents a day. 

00:04:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  And back in the late '40s they offer him 75 cents an hour if he would come work as a contract migrant worker. Well, when he went through this whole route, what happened was that they charged him for meals, the ticket back home and so forth. So he was lucky if he averaged three to five dollars a week to take home. 

00:04:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:30
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So what he did was that, even though Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States he escaped and, and snuck back to New York, saved up enough money as a busboy, and went back to Puerto Rico. 

00:04:40
ALLEN IVEY  Now, you say escape, what do you, what do you mean by that? 

00:04:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Well, uh, when he was on the contract, ah, when he was a contract migrant worker, they made all those, ah, all the Puerto Ricans stick together so if somebody spoke Spanish, they mix them up with some of the Mexicans also. And what happened was, that they had to stay on the farms, they slept in barns and so forth, or in headquarters that they had little huts for the, for the migrant workers. And what happened was that they weren't allowed to go into town. The only place that they were allowed, allowed to go was to church with the farmers. And when the farmers took them to church, many of them were Baptist, and my father was a Catholic. And, however, when my father saw that, that he was making very little, if any, money at all bec, they were basically keeping the money. 

00:05:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:05:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, his meals consisted of, ah, 12 pieces of bread, six, six slices of, ah, of bologna and a, a quart of milk. And when my father first told me that story, I couldn't believe it but that, that's what he'd gone through. And then at one point he decided that he had had enough. But they told that he had to finish the migrant route all the way to Florida before he could go back to Puerto Rico. 

00:05:45
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Well, when my father was in the Carolinas he escaped and went back to New York and he decided he will no longer be a contract migrant worker. So he was considered a fugitive for a while until he went back to the island. 

00:06:00
ALLEN IVEY I'm gonna interject one thing here. It sounds long ago. 

00:06:05
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
ALLEN IVEY I think it's important to know that in Florida today, the same situation occurs. They actually have armed guards over, uhm, some migrant workers in South Florida, ah, to make sure that they stay there. And again they experienced something different but somewhat similar to your father's. So this is not necessarily... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Uh-hmm. 

00:06:20
ALLEN IVEY ...something that happened long ago but your father went through that incredible... (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Exactly. 

00:06:25
ALLEN IVEY ...experience. 

00:06:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And then what happened, uh, when he returned in the early '50s, he, he ended up in Chicago, Illinois. And in Chicago, ah, he, he became part of the chain gang. He came, some of my uncles came and many other Puerto Ri, many other Puerto Ricans came over with him. However, ah, everybody left their wives back in Puerto Rico. Many of the men that came, sad, sad to say, ah, left their wives in Puerto Rico. But my father after a year and a half being here sent back for my mother. Many of the, of my uncle's wives, once they were abandoned in Puerto Rico, all of them left their children with my mother. So my mother was raising ten children, two of her own, two of my sisters, and eight other children that, that, that were not hers. She couldn't speak any Spanish, had no skills and had only gone to fourth grade. When my father raised enough money to send for her, she has sold her house and a few little pigs they had to make sure, 'coz she wouldn't leave any of the children behind. She flew in a two-engine plane from Puerto Rico all the way to Chicago... 

00:07:30
ALLEN IVEY  So you're. (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...by herself with ten children in this plane and nobody could speak to her in Spanish. She said the plane stopped at almost every single state until it got to Chicago and she got there with 10 children. 

00:07:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ My dad and, and she had taken in other, other children. My uncles didn't help, sad, sad to say. And so, it wasn't until 1957 when I was born. Now when I was born, we only spoke Spanish at home and to this day we still do. 

00:08:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, my father passed away over 17 years ago but, but, but my mother still lives. Now she lives in Sterling, Illinois and she's been there for almost 50 years. What had happened during that time is that, is that since we only spoke Spanish, we're only allowed, and we were only allowed to live west of the railroad tracks, and that was a Mexican neighborhood. So I, I was basically raised in an all-Mexican neighborhood. And what had happened is when, when, when my father was on a chain gang, he was gone for 15 to 20 days at a time. 

00:08:40
ALLEN IVEY Uhm, chain gang, you mean railroad, is that it? 

00:08:40
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Railroad. 

00:08:40
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:08:40
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And he had picked up a little bit of English here and there. And what had happened was when he was going through Sterling, Illinois, ah, Northwestern Steel and Wire Company there was hiring people for 50 dollars a week and he wouldn't have to travel, which is about what he was making at Northwestern Railroad. So he moved the family to Sterling, Rock Falls, Illinois area. What, we only spoke Spanish, so what had happened at home is I thought everybody spoke Spanish and we lived in an all-Mexican neighborhood, so everybody did speak Spanish. When I first started school, ah, I attended Merrill School, ah, in Rock Falls, Illinois. And when we went there, ah, they didn't know what to do with me. I only spoke Spanish. So they made me take all these tests. I didn't know what the tests were about. I was a young child, you know, five, six years old, and after they tested me, ah, I was diagnosed as EMH, Educably Mentally Handicapped. 

00:09:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh huh. 

00:09:35
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, and back in those days, they called it retarded. 

00:09:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And so I attended special ed, and I was in special ed in the first two years of school but when I went to special ed, I spent almost my whole day cleaning children, uhm, children that couldn't hold their heads up, children who were in wheelchairs, children who wear helmets. My job was to feed them, clean them and take care of them. And that's what I did, all day long whe, when I was in school those first two years. Ah, however, it wasn't, it wasn't so bad. My, all my cousins were in there with me too. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
ALLEN IVEY Oh yeah(ph). 

00:10:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ We all got diagnosed retarded together. 

00:10:10
ALLEN IVEY  Uh-huh. 

00:10:15
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, what had happened one day was that my father, something happened at home. And I was barely beginning to speak a little bit of English and learning and my father, when something happened at home with my mother, he went to go pick me up at school. And when he went to go pick me up at school, he asked where I was, and the teacher said no. And finally one of them said, "Oh yes, he's in this classroom, over there in the corner." Now, you have to remember that this was in 1962, and none of the laws had passed PL 194 and so forth. So parents didn't have to be notified that the children were put in special ed. And what had happened was my father had gone to the classroom to pick me up, and when he saw me clean, cleaning some children after I just got to feeding them, he hit the ceiling. 

00:10:55
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Now, one of, one of the things that happened during, during, to, during the time I was in special ed, that, that the teachers, not knowing what to do with me that they, they changed my name, so my name they'd changed from Louis, from Luis to Louis. 

00:11:10
ALLEN IVEY  So they actually they took away your name, even. 

00:11:15
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Yes, they changed it to Louis, and they changed my last name to Vazquez, and that's how everybody was pronouncing it. Uhm, and, and I kept telling the teacher, "No, maestra, mi llamo Luis." Ah, "No, my name is, is Luis." And they would say "No, your name is Louis." And I said, "No, it's Luis." They said, "Here at school you are Louis." And so when I went home one time, uhm, my, my father said, "Luis Antonio, come here." You know, in, in Spanish, he said [non-English narration] And I told my father, "No, no, no. My teacher said my name is Louis." He said, "No, your name is Luis." I go, "No, my name is Louis." Well, after some disciplining(ph) I began to realize that I was Luis at home and Louis at school. Well, that day when my father picked me up, he hit the ceiling. I knew he was angry and I wanted to help Mom. She had gotten hurt, she fell, and they needed me to help with the children. 

00:12:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:12:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ See, I have six younger brothers and two older sisters, and those were separate from the first ten children that my mother had raised. 

00:12:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:12:15
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And then, uhm, I don't know what happened but when I went back to school the following week, they, they put me in different classes. And I understand now that they mainstreamed me, but I didn't know it and I hated it. Allen, I hated it. They, I, I was away from my friends, and I, I also felt that I was retarded, that I didn't know anything. And because I felt that way, I didn't wanna be with any of the other kids. They put me in the, in these classes with kids I didn't know. 

00:12:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ They took me away from my friends, and for the longest time, and back then too, the only thing I was really good at was numbers. 

00:12:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Uhm, and, ah, and I like to share a story about that. The reason I got so, so good at numbers is that I would always go with my mother, and as I began to learn a little bit more English, I couldn't read or write, but I began to speak and understand it. What, what had happened is I had become my mother's translator. And when I, and, and everywhere we went, and, and my mother would buy things, I would, I would speak and I would make sure she got the right change because to be (inaudible ) with you, if I didn't bring home the ri, the right change from the money we spent, I was disciplined. 

00:13:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So what had happened is that, that, because we were poor and, and I admit, we had very, very little, uhm, on Tuesday evenings we used to go to Catholic charities. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:35
ALLEN IVEY  So, on Tuesday evenings, you used to go, something has really gotten to you there. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ (inaudible ) Yes, ah, see we were really poor, we really were, and we went to Catholic charities. Uhm, I used to love going because... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...the nuns were there and you could go in and get used clothing... (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...for the family. And so every Tuesday, nobody in my family wanted to go, but I always found it exciting. I guess, everybody was either embarrassed, or, or, or to go and I was not. So I always went, I couldn't wait to go and I, I remember standing in line outside before they open the doors, and because I was a little boy, I would sneak in between the adults and go up to the front of the door. So as soon as they opened the door, I'd be the first one in and my mom would end up following me on. My mother spoke no English, so I did all the translating. I did all the talking. And I had a method though, ah, this is gonna sound a little funny but... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...I would go to shoes first, pants second, shirts third, and unless it was wintertime, then you went shoes, coats, pants and shirts. 

00:14:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh huh. 

00:14:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And so, and what would we do is we fill up these bags and I would start collecting for all my brothers and sisters' cloth, clothes. My mom and I would go through everything, and the nuns would, would, we, we'd walk up with three or four bags of clothing, and the nuns would say, "Well, this is gonna be two dollars or give me three dollars." And I would begin to negotiate with the nuns, and they would let me negotiate with them, and my mom would just stand there and smile 'coz she couldn't speak any English. And many times I got them to give me three big bags of clothing for 75 cents. 

00:15:15
ALLEN IVEY Ah. 

00:15:15
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So. 

00:15:15
ALLEN IVEY  Quite an accomplishment. At the same time, when you started to talk about that story, I noticed you almost started to tear up. Could you just, do, would you like to share what was going on with you at that moment or not? 

00:15:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  Well, I think, I mean, I was a little boy and, ah, I learned, I learned to hustle at a very young age. I learned to, to fend for myself and I think what, when I look back on that now, I think, my gosh we, we didn't have anything and I took on a lot of responsibility. 

00:15:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  But. 

00:15:55
ALLEN IVEY So some of those feelings were really, thinking about a little boy took, who took all this responsibility. Is that close? 

00:16:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Yes. That's exactly what happened. I, what I knew that I was, I was the man of the family. I mean, that's how I really felt. 

00:16:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And, and I was the first boy born to my mother. 

00:16:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  So, I, I just took care things, uhm. 

00:16:15
ALLEN IVEY Well, how would you name that feeling that you have? 

00:16:20
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  That's a complex question because... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
ALLEN IVEY Sure it is. 

00:16:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...when I think back I think of my, my mother who was very dependent. 

00:16:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Because my father was very, very traditional, so she was allowed to do many things. So I think I had, ah, feelings of, of why couldn't she be more independent at times? On the other hand, I realize that without my help, she couldn't become independent. 

00:16:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  Uhm, I also believe that being poor has quite an impact on you, on you. It didn't bother me. I didn't care. I wanted to get the best for my brothers and sisters. 

00:17:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ I and so, from that part, I felt good about it, what I was doing. I, I, I think it, it's just hard when you grow up with so much responsibility, and you're poor, and when you think back of what you did as a child, and you would think, would I ever have my children do that today? 

00:17:20
ALLEN IVEY It's almost like you'd like to cry for your own childhood in some ways. 

00:17:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Exactly, 'coz, see, Allen, I didn't have a childhood. 

00:17:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  I really didn't. 

00:17:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ But because of the circumstances, I really didn't have a choice either. 

00:17:35
ALLEN IVEY I, I can really sense the difficulty, Luis. I'd like just, just stop for just a moment and do one of the things I said I would do at the beginning is that, you've carried on, you and your family carried on with a lot of strength and courage over the time. I'm just wondering if you have any particular single image and I mean a positive image that, that would serve as resource from some of those earlier years. Does anything come to mind as an image that you can see and hear, sort of capsulate something po, a positive strength from the history? 

00:18:05
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  I think to be positive, when I used to go home with the bags of clothing and everybody open up to see what, what, what was brought, I felt real proud because everybody would give me the credit for everything that was chosen and how we put it together. 

00:18:25
ALLEN IVEY So you can kinda, so you can kinda see, you can visualize the scene coming back to the, to your home, the kids all around, your... (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
ALLEN IVEY ...parents there, everybody's saying, "Thanks, what a good job, this is, it's what we really need." 

00:18:40
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Yeah, I could hear my brothers and sisters even today saying, "Wow, that was really cool, man. Yeah, look what it, man this fits me just right." I, an just watching them all, having something they liked. 

00:18:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  That was pretty neat. 

00:18:55
ALLEN IVEY So I hear that feeling of pride. Where does, where do you get that feeling of pride in your body? 

00:18:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  I think I learned to be conscious, I think I learned pride from my parents. Uhm, I mean, can you imagine what it must have been like for two people with a seventh and a fourth grade educations, speak no English. 

00:19:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And come to a foreign country like this, not knowing what was gonna happen to them, whether or not they'd ever be able to return, and having the strength to survive? 

00:19:20
ALLEN IVEY Ah, where do go next, Luis? 

00:19:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Well, I'd like to share to you what happened to me in school, because when I was in school, ah, as a matter of fact I even have one of my report cards that says, uhm, that, that actually, ah, states that, "Even though Luis is retarded and he's very quiet, he's a very nice boy, but we're not sure how far he's going to get in school." 

00:19:45
ALLEN IVEY Even though he's retarded. 

00:19:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Yes, even though I'm retarded. 

00:19:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  And so. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
ALLEN IVEY If you don't mind, I can identify with that. I, I remember when my mother came home, she told me years later, "Ah, Mrs. Ivey, there are some children that just aren't quite bright." So I can, kind of, identify with what you're talking about. 

00:20:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  And you, and you know. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ALLEN IVEY A lot of bad things happened as. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And those images stay with you for a long time. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
ALLEN IVEY Forever. 

00:20:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ When I was going to school, uhm, I'd, I'd, I'd remained really close friends throughout grade school with the kids in special education and, uhm, even though I got mainstreamed, I got put in intermediate, intermediate, ah, to English, Social Science, all those classes. Math was the only course that I could do well in. 

00:20:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ I knew my numbers, 'coz I'd always go with mom, always gotten the right change. I knew how to divide, multiply. I knew how to do all those things before I even got to those areas in school because I had, I was always doing it with my mom every, every time we went shopping. But in the other, in all the other classes, I didn't know how to read or write. So what started happening was that, ah, I got put in the lowest levels. And I don't know if you remember those SRAs where, where you had to do colors to learn. To be able to get to color, you had to read a certain level then you got to go up to the next color. 

00:21:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  Well, I never got to even start the colors. So I was, I was always put in the corner with some book with, ah, like three-word sentences. 

00:21:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:21:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And I was already in third or fourth grade, but then I could speak and understand English very well. However, I still couldn't, I could barely read and write. 

00:21:15
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And, uhm, what started happening was I also began to stutter so I, I was stuttering and the way I speak now, I never spoke this way. I used to begin to speak as though I would, I thank you, and that's how it used to take me forever to say things. I realized later that I had developed such a fear to speak, ah, and I had been called retarded so much that I, I didn't want anybody to hear. 

00:21:45
ALLEN IVEY  Uh-huh. 

00:21:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So even though... (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
ALLEN IVEY (inaudible ). 

00:21:51
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...at times I had the answer, I wouldn't raise my hand 'coz I was scared to death I was gonna stutter and everybody would made fun of me. 

00:21:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So throughout grade school, I was in the right Math classes but not in the other regular courses. And all the way up to about sixth grade, I actually thought I was retarded and I really believed it. I really believed I was retarded. Now one of the interesting things that you're going to find is, is that, ah, with me, is throughout grade school, I went to a public school. And in that public school, I refuse to go to school unless I have black pants, a white shirt and a little black bowtie. 

00:22:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And I went to a public school and everybody made fun of me. Everybody else wore blue jeans, flannel shirts, but I never, ever, ever would go to school unless I have my white shirt, black bowtie, and black pants and every picture you see, whether I'm on the playground, sandbox, that's how I'm dressed. 

00:22:45
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:22:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And I can't tell you why, but I didn't care what kids thought about me. 

00:22:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Since I've done so well on Math, by the time I got to middle school, now we call it junior high in the Midwest, I was put in honors Math, 'coz I could square (inaudible ) math. (crosstalk) 

00:23:02
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:23:02
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ But all the other classes, I was at intro to intermediate, to intermediate at the lowest levels of everything. 

00:23:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  So when I finally realized that I was smart in Math, I thought that was the only thing I was smart at. When I started high school and I was put in vocational courses, I had auto mechanics, I had construction, I had graphic arts, and small engine mechanics. You know, for (inaudible ) and stuff like that. (crosstalk) 

00:23:32
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:23:32
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So for four years, those are the courses I took. But I always kept in touch, ah, with all the, ah, with all my friends in special ed. And the, and then, ah, during that time I had become somewhat of a radical. I grew an afro and I go, my hair curls up and I grew this big afro and that used to bounce around. 

00:23:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  And, ah, I was still put in the lowest of classes except for vocational courses. 

00:23:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And back then, and I got to know quite a few kids 'coz I was easy to make friends with. But still, ah, I should tell you that in sixth grade, there were too many of us Latinos going to the same school. So when we had moved to Douglas Park at that time in Sterling, Ill, Illinois and because we were only allowed to live on the west side 'coz that's where the Mexican-Americans lived, so we were only allowed to move in that neighborhood. You could move to the east side of town, though. That's somewhat changed now. 

00:24:20
ALLEN IVEY  And then when you say you couldn't, I mean, that literally nobody could, would rent to you or anything like that? 

00:24:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Oh, no. 

00:24:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:24:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ You couldn't go on that side. So what happened was they had this lottery thing. 

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  So when I was in sixth grade, my family had won the lottery. And so half of us on the, on the same block got to go to Franklin School, which was a new school they built. What, which was an all-European Anglo school and we were shipped all the way across town to that school. 

00:24:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ I'll never forget the first day we went to school because many of us, well, we were very poor so we wore rubber shoes, ah, it was from the, ah, Woolworth's... 

00:25:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...the five and ten cent store back then. And we have rubber shoes and a little polyester pants, ah, and so forth. And, of course, me, in my black pants and white shirt, black bowtie. Well, we would get off the bus then they would line us up single file and the school is built like a flying saucer, it was round. 

00:25:15
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And after all the Anglo kids got to go to classes, they would single file, line us up and drop us off at each of our classes. Ah, and then at the end of the school. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
ALLEN IVEY Classes was, was integration, supposedly or? 

00:25:35
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Yes. This is integration. Ah, I'd, I'd, I should back up because two years before that, when I was at Wallace School, which is still now in Sterling... 

00:25:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Uhm, they decided that I couldn't pronunciate well. 

00:25:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So I went through, ah, five, six years of phonetic classes also from, ah, first grade up to about sixth, almost seventh. And they use to make me grab this balloon and go puh, puh, people, so I could learn how to pronounce, uhm, ah, letters... (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:26:05
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ ...and so forth and vowels. And the Salvation Army was right across the street. And so what they did during the lunch hour, they would line us up single file, for those of us that they felt we were retarded and then march us across the street to Salvation Army into the basement. And for a whole hour when everybody else is playing tetherball and four square. 

00:26:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ They'd put this great big ea, earphones on us and they would play English tapes and we would listen to the English tapes and they thought that if we listen long enough, that we would learn the language well. 

00:26:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, I learned to speak and understand, but as, but what I need to learn was to read and write. I still can't read or write. 

00:26:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:26:45
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ By the time I got to seventh grade, sixth grade, about six, seven, I could almost read at a third, fourth-grade level, almost. 

00:26:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Well, they kept telling my father that I would never make it and that I would be retarded and I couldn't understand. And my father got really angry, so every night he would take the town newspaper and make me read it in English and half the words I didn't even understand. And after I had read the whole paper in English, then he turned around and make me say everything in Spanish. 

00:27:20
ALLEN IVEY Oh. 

00:27:20
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And I come to realize now that I was reading at third and fourth-grade level and newspapers were written in an eighth-grade level. And so, through a lot of heartache, ha, a lot of heartache and discipline, that's how I started to learn big, bigger words but it was because I was forced so I didn't have a choice. And every night I'd sit there, ah, underneath this lamp on my desk and then I would read the paper to him. Ah, when I got to high school, I, I played sports and so forth, and I became somewhat of a jock in football 'coz we, we love to hit people and the best place to do that is, is in football. 

00:27:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:27:55
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ So, uhm, and throughout, throughout my high school years, they went by pretty fast until my senior year. 

00:28:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ Ah, at the end of my junior year, almost senior year, they had these elections for senior class president. 

00:28:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And the special ed kids had a, had asked me to, ah, to go ahead and run. 

00:28:15
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:28:15
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ And I go, "Oh, man, I don't know about that." I mean, it's always been a white European, ah, person that always won. So, we never had a Latino. 

00:28:25
ALLEN IVEY No. 

00:28:25
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ  And so what happened was that they convinced me to run, to run and I had a lot, a lot of girls that I've become very close friends with. 

00:28:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
DR. LUIS VASQUEZ I never dated anybody. I never went out in, anywhere, we didn't, we didn't have money. 

00:28:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Uhm, and so what happened when they had the elections, and when they voted, I won. 

00:28:50
ALLEN IVEY Ah. 

00:28:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I was the first Latino senior class president in Sterling Township High School. 

00:28:55
ALLEN IVEY Good. 

00:28:55
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Uhm, I'd like to back up just one year the, ah, the year before the. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
ALLEN IVEY Another point of pride. 

00:29:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Hmm? 

00:29:00
ALLEN IVEY Another point of pride. 

00:29:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And it was because of the special ed kids and the girls I, I also would have never won. 

00:29:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Uhm, I like, I like, I like to back up one year, ah, if that's okay, 'coz I just got a memory that came by. Ah, I went to homecoming and, and I had asked this young lady, she's European-American, ah, to homecoming. And we call her Sally, that's not her real name, but I don't wanna say her name. 

00:29:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Uhm, and what had happened was that, uhm, she said yes and since we're really poor, I say, I used to, I used to get 35 cents a day for lunch, 'coz back then you got Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes, milk. I still remember all that. And so, for a whole month I saved my, my, my lunch money. And so I finally had enough to go to this place for a burger and then, you know, and, and pay the homecoming ticket. It was, ah, like two bucks apiece. Well, what happened was that, uhm, I didn't have anything, so I borrowed a sports coat from one of my cousins. I borrowed a shirt from my dad and I borrowed this big bow tie (laughs) from my other cousin and I begged my sister if she let me use her car. She was older than I was. And so I got all dressed up and then the corsage cost, like, 85 cents back then. So, I got ah, ah, you know, corsage; it wasn't special, and I go to pick her up at, at her house. 

00:30:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:30:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Okay. Now I went to pick her up at her house, her father was home. And I go, "Hi. I'm here to pick up Sally." He goes, "Who are you?" I said, "Yeah, Luis." And he goes, "My daughter doesn't go out with Mexicans." "And well, it's okay. I'm Puerto Rican," and what did I know? And he said, "She's not going out with any of you," and I could, I could hear her father yelling at her when he slammed the door on me. Well, I was too embarrassed to go home because I made such a big deal about homecoming. 

00:30:55
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:30:55
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And there's this Rock River that goes right to the middle of town... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:31:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...ah, it's this river there. And I went, and I went to Sinissippi Park, which is right next to the river and I sat on the riverbank. I threw the corsage in the water and I sat there the whole night and waited for homecoming to be over. 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY  Wow. 

00:31:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Uhm, when I went home, I bragged and made a big deal how much fun I had at homecoming 'coz I didn't want anybody to know what happened to me. 

00:31:30
ALLEN IVEY Uhm. 

00:31:30
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ So I never, I, I never got to go. 

00:31:35
ALLEN IVEY So you bore a lot of pain kinda by yourself. 

00:31:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Well, I think I felt ashamed to say anything. 

00:31:45
ALLEN IVEY Oh. 

00:31:45
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And I felt embarrassed, and it wasn't until five or six years later that I finally told some of my brothers what happened, but nobody ever knew. 

00:31:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  I did see the young lady in school the following week and she said, "My father was supposed to be out of town and I thought I, I could sneak out." But she had never talked to me and I never knew. Then came my senior year in high school. When I, by then I, I, I was senior class president and I got invited to all these Rotary Club things where you get to meet all these businessmen. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And I was always borrowing sports coat from my cousin and bow tie here, shirt here, and that was the first time I had ever gone to eat. I never ever had gone to sit out there to eat. 

00:32:25
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:32:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And that's how I started to meet businessmen and so forth. But during that year, I was also taking my government class and, and I and Mrs. Karen Bosen(ph). She was a 6'2" Irish woman. Ah, and it was around March of my senior year and I was the only one in my family that have ever gotten that far. Everybody else had dropped out and all my relatives, none of them got past, ah, 8th grade, (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
ALLEN IVEY Oh. 

00:32:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ 9th grade, right in there. So I sit in gover, in government class and we're goofin' around. It was Dave Vargas, Eddie Fuentes, Tony Fuentes, Luis Rodriguez myself, and my teacher goes, "If anybody thinks that they can teach this class better than I do." We were goofing around at the back, we weren't... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
ALLEN IVEY Well. 

00:33:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...paying attention, and so I stood up and I walked to the front of the class. 

00:33:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And that teacher made me teach class the next two days and she said if I wouldn't, I would not pass government, and therefore I wouldn't graduate, and I was gonna be the first one to graduate and my father would have killed me. 

00:33:30
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:33:30
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ So for the next two days I taught class. Then she told the next day, "Look, I need to talk to you so come here during your lunch hour," and I thought, "Oh my God. I wonder what it, I'm really in trouble," coz I, I didn't want to get kicked out. And when I came in, she sat me down and she looked at me and says, "Luis?" I go, "Yes Mrs. Bosen(ph)?" She goes, "Where do you plan to go to college?" And that's the first time in my life anybody ever asked me if I wanted to go to college. 

00:34:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And I told her what my dad told me many, many times before, you know, and other relatives, "College was for the rich," and my family would give me a, all they could, but we couldn't afford it. We had nine kids and so forth. And Mrs. Bosen(ph) said, "Look, I want you to go to the counselor's office and go pick up the catalogues for the universities and bring them back to me. And I, you know, I will, we'll get you to apply. Don't worry," and I go, "Nah, well, okay." So I went to go see my counselor, ah, who is Ms. Faber(ph), and if I should have said her name, but, but she played a crucial role in my life. I went in to go see her, ah, she was a, a 5'2" Anglo woman, blonde hair, blue eyes. I'm telling you that for a reason, that when I got in, she looked to me and I, and I told her, "Mrs. Bosen(ph) said I, like I come and get catalogues, 'coz she said I, I could go to college." And she said, "Well you're in vocational course, and I think you'd be a good mechanic," and I go, "Well, no, no, she said I could come to get the catalogues," and she finally looked at me and she goes, "Son, you're too stupid to go to a real college. I don't know why you wanna go," and I blew up, and I didn't mean to, and I blew up and I told her, "You think I'm stupid?" and we got into an argument and Mr. Young, the principal came around the corner, grabbed me and escorted me out of the school counselor's office. 

00:35:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ So I went back to Mrs. Bosen(ph) and told her I couldn't get the catalogues. And she goes, "Don't worry about it, I'll get them. Come, come tomorrow during your lunch hour." When I came the following day, Mrs. Bosen(ph) had put all these catalogues out on this table and she sat me down. 

00:35:45
ALLEN IVEY Uhm. 

00:35:45
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And she goes, "Luis, let's look to here(ph) to see what kinda college you wanna go to." Uhm, "Sure, why not?" So we kept going through all these catalogues and seen a lot of pictures and I saw this picture of this beautiful building, with flowers and trees. It looked like a really neat place and, and I go, "I like, I like to go there. That seems kinda cool." We looked at it and it was Illinois State University. 

00:36:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ That's how I chose my college. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY From pictures. 

00:36:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Just from pictures. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY Pretty flowers. 

00:36:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ No major thought, just pretty flowers and a building. And Mrs. Bosen(ph) said, and I told her, "You know I can't afford the application. I can't afford." Her husband was an accountant at the steel mill and he had a watch line(ph), and she said, "Don't worry about it." And her husband called in for all the different applications, you know, for the Illinois State. (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:36:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And she paid my applications' fees. 

00:36:45
ALLEN IVEY She did? 

00:36:50
[sil.] 

00:36:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  She paid my fees, didn't charge me anything. 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And she told me, "Son, you're going to college." Well, I got excited. I went home and told my dad "I'm going to school, went(ph) at school," and they said, "[non-English narration]" "You know, son, we're very poor," and goes, "So, you know, but if you work, that would be better," and, and I want to go to college. It's not that they didn't want me to go to college. It's that... (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm 

00:37:30
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...for them, I was finishing high school. And for them, it was like I was getting a Ph.D. Nobody ever made it past 8th grade. 

00:37:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:37:35
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ So, what happened then is that by then it was really late. We're talking about the end of March, early April... (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
ALLEN IVEY Oh. 

00:37:45
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...and Mrs. Bo said, I had to apply for financial aid and they need my father's financial aid papers. Well, he is very traditional, so I need his income tax papers, so then I went and I went home and I, I broke into his, his iron box and I stole his financial aid papers. 

00:38:00
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:38:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I mean his, ah, the income tax papers to fill up my financial aid forms. We send them off and then, uhm, Mrs. Bosen(ph) made arrangements and said I was supposed to go to orientation at Illinois State University in July but I had to take these darn ACTs. 

00:38:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Well, excuse me for a second, Allen, I. 

00:38:20
ALLEN IVEY  Well. (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I took these ACTs, and when I took these ACTs, ah, the, the, the, she paid the extra amount for me to get the scores back, you know, quickly, and I came out with a 9 in Social Science. 

00:38:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ A 9 in science, a 9 in English, and I had a 26 in math. And when, when they prorated the scores and so forth, I don't how they came up to it, but I ended with an overall 17 composite, and in Illinois, if you had a 17 composite, you could attend any state university if you had a C average or above. 

00:39:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  So I was admitted to Illinois State University... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah. 

00:39:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...on four years of vocational classes and an ACT of 17. 

00:39:10
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:39:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And the reason for that was the 26 I got in Math. 

00:39:10
ALLEN IVEY Good thing you've kept track of your numbers. 

00:39:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Oh yeah, 'coz they were. 

00:39:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ (inaudible ). 

00:39:20
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:39:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Because I was senior class president, I got to do the, the commencement, the commencement speech, and my parents had showed up for, for graduation but they left right away after they heard me speaking. I looked up in the audience and he knew who they were. My God, my dad always wears a Panamanian hat, real flowered shirt, you know, and my mom wore a flowered dress. Well, that summer, ah, as soon as I graduated, I found two jobs. I was working at Goodyear full time, 40 hours a week. I was pumping gas 40 hours a week. So I was working 80 hours a week. 

00:39:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And I, and, and, every week I'd, because I, we needed the money as a family, and in our family, culturally, we all help each other. So every week I sign off the checks and just hand them over to my parents so they could help with the kids and so forth. Well what happened was that in the middle of July, I had orientation for Illinois State, and I kept telling my dad, "I'm gonna go to orientation." He didn't know what that was, and he goes, "No, No, you're working. You're making good money." "No, no dad. I'm gonna go to Illinois State." Well, July came and I knew he didn't want me to go. So I took two days off and I snuck out. 

00:40:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I had one of my friends drive me all the way to Illinois State for orientation. When I went to orientation, I was with all these kids from all over the state and out of state and they were taking courses like physics, calculus, anthropology, physiology, all these different courses, so I took the same thing. I thought, well if they could do it, and they said look, if you have fifteen hours or more, you can finish faster. So I signed up for all these courses. Ah, and then that, that, that evening in the dormitories, they told me, the residence assistant, they came to talk to all of us and said, "You, you, you know that you're number one thousand something on the waiting list for a place to live in the dorms," so because when I had applied, it was so late. So he goes, "Why don't you go to clearing(ph) house, and take a look to see what's available for the next day." So the next morning I went over to clearing(ph) house and they gave me a list of all these apartments. So we started, and I started go look at apartments, and everybody started asking me for a deposit. Allen, I didn't know what a deposit was. 

00:41:25
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:41:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I never lived anywhere. They were asking me for $150 for deposit, I didn't have a penny to my name. So I went back to the residence assistance and said, "I need some more time to find a place to live. Can you guys please book me up?" and the residence assistant at that time gave up their room and gave me free meal tickets for myself and my friend to stay a couple more nights till I found a place to live. 

00:41:50
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:41:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Well by then I was desperate and I knew I couldn't go back home, and I had called my father and he said, "Where are you? You missed work." And I go, "I'm in Illinois State," and oh my God, you blew up, because work, he, he had a very strong work ethic and no matter what, your job came first. 

00:42:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  Well, what had happened was that the following morning, I knew I didn't have any money, and if, if you ever been to Illinois State, there's, there's waters(ph) and towers, these big dormitories, and a block over there's Broadway Street. 

00:42:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  Well what had happened was I didn't have any money, so I went over to Broadway street the following morning and I went from door to door and I knocked on people's doors and begged them, I begged them to take me in the fall 'coz I didn't have a place to live to go to school. 

00:42:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I don't know what made me do that or why, but I went from door to door and I begged for a place to live. 

00:42:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Everybody said no, all the way down the block until I reached the corner and there was this house that had these letters, TKE, and I thought it was Teekee(ph) House or something, so I went in there, later I found out it was a fraternity. And I met this guy named Chuck Duffy(ph) from New York. He, he was an Italian fellow, and I told my story about everything I've been through and what had happened and how I needed to come back. That person, and I don't know what he's doing now, but that person took me in and so he said, "When you come back in August, you can still be for free for two months." 

00:43:35
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:43:35
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ "Don't worry about it. I'll take of it," and he took me in. So the next morning I was gonna go, I went back home 'coz now I knew I had a place to stay. I was admitted to college. I was signed up for all this courses. And when I went back I told my, my mother and father, "I'm leaving on August 22nd. I'm leaving August 22nd. I'm going to college," and they said, "Oh no, no. You stay right here." "No, no. I'm going to college. I'm going to college." "No, no college for this." "I'm going to college," and they said, (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
ALLEN IVEY Oh wow there Luis. 

00:44:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ "Luis." Huh? 

00:44:05
ALLEN IVEY A little wild there. 

00:44:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I know could, ah, I just, oh, well, on August 22nd at 5:30 in the morning, I quit my two jobs and at 5:30 in the morning on August 22nd, I got up in the morning and I filled up two bags, one was, ah, those old sacks, those was brown sacks. One had my clothes in it, the other sack had some pots and pans and I have my guitar. 

00:44:30
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Well my ride, Luis Rodriguez was gonna give me a ride to Illinois State University. Well, he arrived late, so he didn't get there till a little bit after seven. Well by then everybody had, had woken up, and you have remember that there were nine of us, and, ah, I grew up in a house where there was two bedrooms, nine of us slept in one room and mom and dad in the other. And so what had happened was that when I, when I went to the bedroom to say goodbye to my sisters, they won't, they won't, they won't come out of the bedroom. And they started crying and they said, "Don't go. We're never gonna see you again," 'coz they're actually afraid that they were never gonna see me again. I went to the kitchen. My mother was there, she cried and she cried, said, "I'm never gonna see you again. Don't go. Don't go." And by then I, you know, I too started crying. I walked outside and all my six brothers jumped on me and begged me not to go. And I went to my father. I go, "I gotta go." My father took his hand out, shook my hand and said, "Now you've become a man." 

00:45:30
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:45:30
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And he walked inside. Well I got into this 1971 blue Datsun Station Wagon with Luis Rodriguez, and my brother, Nelson, the one who follows me, and asked my father if he could, he could come and because the trip to Illinois State was almost two and half hours. And by that time, I was crying and crying so I sat in the back seat. My, my brother got to come, and I must have cried almost to all the way to Illinois State. It was a two-and-a-half-hour drive. I think I cried about two hours of it. 

00:46:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  I got to Illinois State and I went up to the room, into the apartment. It took me all but five minutes to unload all. All I have is a bag of clothes and, and my pots and pans. I went out to the front yard and I sat down, and I go, "Guys, I guess this is goodbye," and my brother Nelson goes, "Look, why don't we take you to eat." I don't know. You guys don't have any money," and all I have is $150 in my back pocket, so I had to save 'coz I had been giving my checks... (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...to my, to my, to my parents. He said, "No, no. Dad gave me $20 to take you to eat before we left you." So we went to McDonalds. Ah, this is gonna sound weird to you, but back then, Big Macs are 50 cents, and we went to McDonalds and you can have a free one if you sang the Big Mac song. 

00:46:55
ALLEN IVEY Oh. 

00:46:55
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  So here we are, three Latinos that (inaudible ) at Illinois State University just so we could get an extra Big Mac and we started singing that Big Mac Song... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:47:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ..so we could have an extra burger to eat so we could save the money. 

00:47:10
ALLEN IVEY  Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Well, after we ate, they took me back to the, to the, to the room and then when they left, I cried and cried and I sat in the front yard again and I, I was only 17 years old when I graduated from high school and I said, "What am I doing here? What am I doing here?" and I cried. Soon after, I got a bill for three thousand one hundred something dollars that was to pay for a room to board, I mean for, for books, fees, tuition. And, it's books, fees, tuition, and a cafeteria, ah, tsk, coupon that I bought so, so I, so I could eat. What, what had happened then that, uhm, I realized I couldn't make it. Allen, I actually thought I was gonna make it on a $150 dollars in my back pocket. I, I honestly believed that. 

00:48:10
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:48:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  So I went looking for jobs, and nobody was hiring except for Pinkerton Security Guard, and you had to be 21 years old. I lied about my age and I took a job at Pinkerton Security Guard and I worked the 11 to 7 shift, 40 hours a week. So I went to classes from 8 to 12 and 9 to 1 and I slept from 1 to 10 and I worked from 11 to 7. And those guys in the TKE house, when I met them, those guys took turns to take me to work every night. 

00:48:50
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:48:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And at 7am the next morning, those guys were there to pick me up and bring me back. 

00:49:00
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:49:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I went... (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
ALLEN IVEY So school(ph). 

00:49:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ ...to classes. There were neat guys, ah, a lot them, of course, a lot us didn't graduate if we, but, ah, so I worked 40 hours a week and went to school full time. My, ah, I remember I couldn't get my first check. I, I was, I was making two dollars and seventeen cents an hour. I couldn't get my first check till a month later, and with the money I had, you see I can't stand peanut butter and jelly right now. For a whole month, I bought these big gallons of peanut butter and big gallons jelly and I went to the Wonder Bread Store on Tuesday 'coz you can buy loaves of bread for a nickel. Then I would freeze it. And for a whole month, I eat peanut butter jelly for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And every time I would call my parents and my dad was angry at me so he would talk to me 'coz he thought I was gonna come home, and, ah, and ah, and I never did. But what had happened was that when I talked to mom, she would ask do I need anything. I al, I lied and I said I was doing great, and that life was great, and I was starving. 

00:50:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  But I got through. I kept working and what had happened was my first semester at Illinois State University, I finished that first semester with a 1.69, and I was getting kicked out of school. I was, I wa, I wanted to show that I could make it. I went to the dean of the College of Education and I begged him and I begged him to let me stay and I begged him. He felt sorry for me and he let me stay an extra semester. So, finally, ah, in December, I wanted to go home really bad 'coz when I worked for Pinkerton Security Guard, I, I walked the catwalks every night and (inaudible ) General Electric. One of my roommates was selling his car 'coz he joined the Navy. 

00:50:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  It was a 1968 Buick Le Sabre and it only went backwards, it didn't go forward. 

00:51:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Had a nice stereo and so I sold the stereo and fixed the transmission. The tires were bald and it was in the middle winter. I took half of the air out of tires and drove all the way to Sterling(ph), Illinois. 

00:51:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ When that had happened, when I got home, my father wouldn't speak to me. That whole night on Christmas Eve we argued and we fought. We argued and we fought and we watched the sunrise together, and by the time the sun came up my father said, "You really wanna go to school, don't you?" "Well, yeah," he goes, "There nothing I can do to stop you. I'll do whatever I can." And that's when my father and I made peace with each other that was, that I was away to college. Throughout that time in college I always work full time. 

00:51:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And at weekends I work at the cinema. I graduated in five years with a major in Spanish with a minor in, in, in political science ah, in secondary education, but it took me five years to get through. 

00:52:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And I know to this day if I wasn't for Mrs. Karen Bosen(ph), my high school teacher, I would never gotten that far. 

00:52:15
ALLEN IVEY I know. 

00:52:15
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I had a, when I, when I went to graduate, I begged my parents to come to my graduation. 

00:52:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  And they wouldn't come. They, my father wanna come and I couldn't understand why. But one of my cousins made my parents come. And when they showed up I realized why. When I looked up in the audience, I saw my mother and father and you can see that they stuck out like, I mean my father with his flowered shirt, Panamanian hat, my mom with her bright-colored dress. I was one of, one of seven Latinos graduating in 1980 from Illinois State University. When I first rode to Illinois State University in 1975, there were nine of us. 

00:52:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Out of 23,000 students that were Latino. 

00:53:00
ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:53:00
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ On that whole campus. And, when I graduated, I had the opportunity to work for IBM in sales and be a social worker. I took a job as a child abuse investigator for $11,900 a year. I think the message I'd like to send people is that none of us do it by ourselves. 

00:53:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  There's very, very important people in our lives. I know I will not become friends with you, and, and for me, I, I consider that a big honor and be even, you've helped me. I've helped you. We've helped each other. None of us are alone. And I think if anybody gets anything out of this is that we need each other to go forward and no one does it alone. So, for the kids that are out there, whether to be Latino or whatever they are, don't believe when people tell you I did it by myself, because we didn't. 

00:53:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. I think one of the thing that's really important to say as we wind down here is that you went on and got your doctorate at, ah, the University of Iowa. You worked closely with Ursula Delworth. You became a model and an inspiration. And have... (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Yes. 

00:54:10
ALLEN IVEY ...got on basically then to become department head here at New Mexico State, ah, and become basically leader, a national leader in the profession, ah, which is far, far away from roots in, in Puerto Rico. It's really a very remarkable, a very remarkable story, ah, of achievement, persistence, pride, courage and you say no one does it alone. 

00:54:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  No, they don't, and Ursula is a big inspiration, and one of my biggest inspiration, I must say, was my wife, Emelina Vazquez. 

00:54:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ She, ah, without her, I don't think I could ever make it to graduate school. And I know that. 

00:55:00
ALLEN IVEY I, I love the story of, ah, you going to graduate school and, ah, actually, ah, finishing in a very quick time. 

00:55:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Yes it, I, I, I, I was, out of my class, there were eight of us that went and I was the first to graduate on time within the five years. And both (inaudible ) and I both got our doctorates together with two children. 

00:55:20
ALLEN IVEY Pretty good for a fellow that was ah, once diagnosed, ah, retarded. 

00:55:25
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ And you know, to this day, ah, because people have asked me if I want to be tested. I refuse to be tested. I refuse to be tested. I don't wanna know 'coz there was a test that diagnosed me as retarded(ph) to begin with. 

00:55:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I don't wanna know. 

00:55:40
ALLEN IVEY  Test, tests are, can be very very oppressive. And for me, the tests are oppressive(ph) and people that use them are oppressors. 

00:55:50
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ  What I notice about testing is the only bias is, is the administrator is bias. They can use them to hurt just as much you can use then them to help people. 

00:56:00
ALLEN IVEY  So it's really a very elegant story, and you've heard Luis, ah, I find it just plain very moving, and I feel honored and proud of myself to have heard your story. I think it's really important in this, ah, for counselors, and therapists, and you might, I think I like you wind up after I, I give my sort of the final thing, for counselor and therapist to be aware that, hey, our first diagnosis is often wrong, and to you, your final words, one minute. 

00:56:40
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ I, I just, I just wanna thank you for the opportunity for allowing me to share my story with you. Uhm, I think I know when it feels honored. I'm the one that feels humble over, over it because when I think back, I wonder how many kids could have been successful. It just so happened that I was the exception and it would be nice if someday, that we there would become a rule. 

00:57:05
ALLEN IVEY Now. Amen. Thanks so much Luis. 

00:57:10
DR. LUIS VAZQUEZ Thank you very much.
