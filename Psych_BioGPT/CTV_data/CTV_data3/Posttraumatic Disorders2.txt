00:00:00
UNKNOWN Welcome everyone, ah, it is now time to start the topic on panel on, ah, post-traumatic stress disorder and to, ah, talk with us about, ah, this topic we have a very distinguished panel. Ah, we have Francine Shapiro, ah, well known for work in trauma and Bessel van der Kolk and Bill O'Hanlon. Ah, all of these individuals, ah, with our great deal of information, ah, and I would, ah, asked you to join me and welcome them.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy Treatment of PTSD Francine Shapiro, Ph.D. Mental Research Institute 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Maybe-- if we can put the slide on please? Great. 

00:00:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I'm going to run quickly through some slides just to give an idea for those of you who don't know, ah, I originated in EMDR Therapy which is a terrible name. It stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing but I'm speaking from that advantage point so I'll give a bit of an overview and, and give you say applications. 

00:01:05
Releasing the Neurophysiological and Psychological Blocks to: • Emotional Healing • Forgiveness • Self-acceptance • Happiness • Loving relationships • Peaceful communities 

00:01:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO What we're looking at in terms of EMDR treatment is the same I think is that we all want as clinicians that is releasing the neurophysiological and the psychological blocks to emotional healing, forgiveness, self-acceptance, happiness, loving relationships, peaceful communities. When we're dealing with PTSD I just like to remind people that it's just a PTSD by definition on certain symptom clusters, just getting read of those symptoms doesn't mean, mean that you're necessarily have a healthy happy individual. It's important to be able to look comprehensively through the clinical picture to see what else needs to be addressed. Treating traumas often like taking a quilt off the mattress that you see all of the other lumps like a terrible relationships, the inability to bond, the feeling of not being successful, so just remembering that, that we're looking through the entire clinical picture. 

00:02:00
Empirical Status • EMDR therapy is considered an "A" level treatment for trauma, recommended by organizations such as the World Health Organization • More than 24 randomized controlled trails (RCT) support the use of EMDR therapy with a wide range of trauma populations • 20 RCT support positive effects of eye movements • Research indicates direct effects on working memory and a link into REM sleep processes • RCT indicate that 84-100% of single-trauma victims no longer have PTSD after the equivalent of three 90-minute sessions Complex PTSD needs move extensive treatment 

00:02:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO In terms of empirical status of the EMDR therapy it's an A level treatment recommended by organizations like the World Health Organization. More than 24 randomized controlled trails support it and it has a component of bilateral stimulation which can be eye movements or a taps or tones and there's 20 randomized control trails that have demonstrated a positive effects in the mid-analysis has shown that this, this component is a makes a significant addition to the therapy. The research indicates that there is direct effect on working memory and there's a link into rapid eye movement sleep processes. So, what we're looking at in EMDR therapy is accessing the, ah, the memory and this for PTSD let's say the trauma and stimulating the brain inherent information processing system and allowing the appropriate linkages to be made in order to allow it arrive at an adapt of resolution and the randomized control trails indicate that 84 to 100% of single-trauma victims no longer have PTSD after the equivalent of three 90-minute sessions and of course, if you're working with complex trauma, you need more extensive treatment, uhm, more sessions cuz there's more memories. 

00:03:25
World Health Organization (2013) • Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and EMDR are the only psychotherapies recommended for children, adolescents and adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No pharmaceuticals are recommended. • "This therapy is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously ton (a) spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and (b) bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements. 

00:03:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So, here's something that came up recently from the World Health Organization that trauma-focused CBT and EMDR, the only psychotherapies, ah, recommended for treatment of PTSD and children, adolescents and adults. And the no pharmaceuticals are recommended. So you're in the right place in terms of the mental health professional treating PTSD with, a, a psychological approach rather than with medication. They also point, there is differences between the two treatments. Unlike CBT with the trauma-focused, EMDR does not involve detailed descriptions of the event, direct challenging of beliefs, extended exposures or homework. So that means if you have-- I mean, if you work with molestation victims or a veterans, have you notice they often don't wanna talk about the even? In the EMDR therapy, they do not have to give you the details so you can start where they are, the processing goes on internally it doesn't involving. And also for highly disturbed clients, you don't need homework. So all of the, ah, therapeutic work is done within your regulating presents. So that means the amount in preparation that you need for them is a lot better. The relationship is important in any form of therapy but it's clearly not sufficient if the relationship and talking was sufficient we wouldn't have had Vietnam veteran suffering for 20 years before they actually get help when the empirically supported, ah, treatments were, were developed. Now, the difference and by the way, for anyone who wants I'll be showing a treatment tomorrow during the conversation hour if you're interested. 

00:05:20
Extinction v Reconsolidation • Suzuki et al. (2004). Memory Reconsolidation and Extinction Have Distinct Temporal and Biochemical Signatures. Journal of Neuroscience, 24, 4787– 4795 • Exposure Therapy: Extinction forms a new competing memory • EMDR Therapy: Reconsolidation alters the initial memory • EMDR Therapy: Transmutation of memory image, belief, elimination of pain, arousal, etc. • Stickgold (2002, 2008). EMDR links into processes that occur during REM sleep 

00:05:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So anyway, the difference between CBT and EMDR therapy also points to difference in neurobiological underpinnings that is when you are using extended exposures the research indicates that the treatments effects are based on extinction. With extinction the targeted memory remains unchanged but a new one is created. So, the individual who believes in, in behavior therapy, the belief is that the reason the PTSD is maintained is because of avoidance that the individual-- the client doesn't wanna think about the event because they are afraid they'll go crazy that the anxiety will be too high to they will die or, or go crazy. So by having them talk about the event describing in detail, in the presence of the therapist you'd create an awareness they won't die from it and then, this new memory is encoded but the original one is there. Within EMDR what you observe is accessing the memory, stimulating the information processing system, you can see the shift in the components of that memory simultaneously, the image changes, the thoughts, the emotions, the physical sensations and the it stored in the altered form that difference in neurobiological underpinnings also shows up in some of the research. 

00:06:45
EMDR v Exposure Therapy/Guide Mourning (Sprang, 2002) • EMDR condition: Accelerated rate of recovery in all behavioral measures and twice the rate of positive recall EMDR also superior in 4 of 5 standardized measures Effects maintained at 9 month follow-up 

00:06:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's an example of EMDR therapy compared to guided mourning for a complicated grief and what we find often when the grief is not resolving it goes along with negative images of the deceased, images of the person dying, of suffering, of the, of the, the one who's left behind feeling, I should have done this, I should have done all the things, I should have done, I could have done, this continue to come up and they continue to get bombarded. So here the treatment of the trauma of the loss of the, of the loved one what you see compared of EMDR to the exposure, the EMDR for the pro-- for a positive symptoms, you can see you have a much-- a more rapid decline and symptoms though the exposure therapy are get-- eventually gets there but what you have is about a two-- twice as much positive recall of the deceased with the EMDR therapy as you do with the guided imagery and its maybe because the, ah, extinction again leaves that old memory intact and it's interfering with access to the positive networks. Here's another example of something that's never been reported with, ah, exposure therapies. 

00:08:05
EMDR Treatment of Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) IES BDI Russell, 2007 EMDR Treatment of PLP (Russell, 2007) 

00:08:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO When someone has a trauma of an accident where a limb is damaged and needs to be amputated they may continue to feel actually majority continue to feel pain. Now, we may say, well, some said that memory is in the body but there's no body. So what we're looking at is the unprocessed memory which contains the emotion, the physical sensations, the beliefs is health and, and trapped, frozen in time. The person is feeling is feeling the pain in the missing limb because of transmission through the efferent, efferent system. So using EMDR to process that memory of that trauma here's a, a veteran who had PTSD along with the phantom limb and you can see after two sessions the declining in the impact of event scale and the back depression inventory but importantly you can see the shift in the, ah, phantom limb pain. He started out with, uhm, a hi-- sowing pain, shooting, radiating, aching, tingling, at the end of the two sessions what he had was tingling. So we would say, if there is neuropathy, if there is actual nerve damage then, it's not going to change and that's what we assume the tingling is from but all of the other sharp, sharp pains, all these pains related to the accident in the amputation those are gone. 

00:09:35
Redefinition of "Trauma" • Mol et al. (2005) • "Life events can generate at least as many PTSD symptoms as traumatic events." • "For events from the past 30 years the PTSD scores were higher after life events than after traumatic • Obradovic et al, (2010) • "Exposure to adverse, stressful events ...has been linked to socioemotional behavior problems and cognitive deficits" • EMDR therapy uses three-pronged approach to process relevant adverse life experiences See also Research List 

00:09:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The other thing I'd like to highlight quickly is, the importance of a redefinition of trauma because many people come in for treatment and they're given anti-anxiety or anti-depressant because, ah, most of these clinicians are not aware of the research that indicates that general life events that life events can generate at least as many PTSD symptoms as major trauma. So when you have someone coming for treatment don't just stop with what's the critic-- is, is there a molestation, is there a rape, is there a combat. Many of these other adverse life experiences are going to be, ah, playing up and there is certainly much research that says expo-- exposure to adverse stressful events had been link to socioemotional behavioral problems, a large Kaiser's study conducted by Feletti showed clearly that adverse experiences from childhood were related to the leading causes of death in adult. So not only psychological issues of, ah, substance abuse and depression et cetera but cardiac problems, ah, cancer even, ah, fractured, ah, bones. I mean, in-- it is that much of an impact from the number of childhood, ah, adverse experience was highly correlated with the incidents of having these major problems. Uhm, so EMDR therapy uses a three-pronged approach. We process the earlier memories that set the groundwork for the problem, the current situations that trigger the disturbance and we incorporate positive templates for appropriate future ac-- action, for a rape victim and maybe to know that they are okay walking on the same streets that look like where they rape, for a pervasive developmental trauma. Do they need to learn the skills about interactions relationships et cetera? So that's part of the processing that takes place. 

00:11:35
PTSD and Child Maltreatment • "Maternal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression in Pediatric Primary Care: Association With Child Maltreatment and Frequency of Child Exposure to Traumatic Events" Chemtob et al. (2013) JAMA Pediatr. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2218 • Important implications worldwide. 

00:11:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And just and awareness that new research also indicates that mother's who have PTSD, ah, it is associated with maltreatment of their children. Now that means the moms are so primed in terms to the anxiety, the high arousal, everything that goes along with PTSD. They're not able to bond with their children in very often or if the child is crying, they don't react and reaching out. They re-- they can react in pushing away that reactivity that volatility means that we are relaying suffering, we are transmitting suffering from one generation to the next 

00:12:15
Treatment on Consecutive Days No Homework Needed • Teams of therapists for short term field work • Complete therapy in days not weeks or months • War front • Disaster response • Remote areas with few mental health workers • Highly disturbed clients of all kinds 

00:12:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So what we've done is since EMDR therapy, you don't need a homework to have effects, positive effects we can give treatment on consecutive days or with extended sessions and they are teams we have going out for our short term field work. Again, if a natural disaster occurs the research says three sessions and you can complete PTSD treatment. We have teams going out to d that and in addition to the war front, disaster response, think of your more highly disturb clients where you're trying to work with the an early stages of therapy after this-- the preparation of a highly volatile memories that are kicking them, you can schedule consecutive day or morning afternoon session finish up that, that memory that kicking them. They don't have to stay with it for three weeks. You can finish it up in three sessions. 

00:13:10
Earthquake in Mexico 1 Session (85 to 120) Mean Impact of Even Scores 12 week follow-up -- despite aftershocks (Jarero et al, 2011) 

00:13:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Here's another example of treatment of an earthquake in Mexico only one session extended, session and you can see sort of randomized trial, you can see the difference between the waitlist control that stay the same until they were treated and the effects are solid. Ah, this is a 12-week follow-up despite aftershocks. 

00:13:30
Working On The Trauma Rape Victims Democratic Republic of the Congo • Evaluation with Impact of Even Scale and Subjective Units of Distress Scale (0-10) • After two sessions women reported cessation of PTSD symptoms and pain in lower back (from rape) 

00:13:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO In addition group protocols had been developed so an example is working with women who in the Congo that, ah, who were raped. So they use a bilateral stimulation like, like this called the butterfly hug so you can do it in groups and after two sessions the women reported no longer having the, the traumatic reactions and in addition they reported that the back pain that they had since the rape you know, where their hail down, had disappeared so that goes along with the notion of phantom limb that a lot of chronic pain conditions that individual may have can be this on process memories.

00:14:30
BILL O'HANLON I'm Bill O'Hanlon, everybody I think knows me so after a little introduction to who I am, uhm, and I was student of Milton Erickson so I was his gardener when I was in graduate school cuz I can't afford a pen, uhm, but that profoundly influence the direction of my therapeutic life and because Erickson was sort of a resource therapist he thought people that resources that if topped into could help the healing process and that really you know, because I was trained as a general psychotherapist which was more or it was how people damage to what was wrong with people in their deficits that was a big shift for me. Erickson even saw all their symptoms has assets and abilities you know, a really amazing abilities that they can you know, dissociate, that was an incredible ability. So that gave me an appreciation for and I did learn hypnosis we were just talking about that before I started-- before we started, uhm, I went on to write 36 books on psychotherapy and for the general public and three of which were on trauma, one on sex retreating, sexual abuse called they even from a broken web. Another one, on rapid trauma resolution techniques, uhm, which I'll speak about here a little I think, uhm, it's called, ah, quick steps resolving trauma and then another one on-- actually my favorite topic on trauma because again this resilience model and the resource model, ah, it's called thriving through crisis and it's about tro-- post-traumatic success because we all know people have been through terrible life experiences and traumas and although that's a terrible thing that happened they came out of it in some ways better and growing in a good direction probably this happened to many of you here and I got really interested in what makes that difference because a lot of the people we see in therapy haven't had that experience, they are really damaged and, and shrunk by their traumas and frozen in time as, ah, as Francine said. And then, there are some people who really seemed to develop and move on in large part because of the terrible life experience they were exposed to and I think there are some research that shows what makes a difference there and maybe what good chance talking about that. Uhm, I think that what Francine said that, that, ah, afraid, frozen and time is a good one to, ah, described the people who we typically see in therapy that are post-traumatic. Ah, they not only get frozen in time but they get frozen in their bodies and physiology, in neurology, in beliefs, in their actions, in their relationships, how they related to others, in their perceptions and sensations and sometimes they only get frozen in 0ne of these things or maybe a better way to say that sometimes they loop through the same repeating portion of experience metaphorically or actually, uhm, it's not just a moment in time. It's a loop of experience that they keep repeating until they don't. Uhm, and I think for me and my, ah, thinking about this and my treating trauma, ah, focused for many years 35 so years, I-- there are four fixes generally to me and I think what Francine was talking falls in two of the categories. And the-- one is to change patterns. The people get stuck and you know, John Weakland, my-- one of my old friends, a brief therapist said, you know, life is just one damn thing after another but for people who come in to therapy life has become damn thing over and over again and so, my thought was we get them from the same damn thing over and over again back to one damn thing after another, get out their lives. And-- so, one of the things we do is how people get on stuck from the same patterns that don't work for them internally or externally or you know, in the world. And so, that's one of the four fixes of trauma-- in trauma treatment and, ah, I think EMDR in part fits in that. There is more going on but that's one of the thing that does. Uhm, it changes this frozen physiological body, neurological belief patterns, uhm, it challenges them and changes them. I think also making new associations and connections where they're been unhelpful associations before is another broad category of how people have successfully treated trauma and I think that another one is kind of counterintuitive but I, I used it myself and then I've used it some other people I treated in and I actually heard the best example of it from Viktor Frankl who gave a key known address at this conference in 1990. He was talking about a moment in, in, uhm, outside the, the last tough camp he was in, he last prison camp he was in, in which, he almost died and he alost gave up and it was terribly traumatic, he was almost killed and he project himself into the future in a moment when he was giving a lecture on the psychology of death camps and the psychology meanings and he was able then to get up and move through this terrible experience that he'd been experiencing and he said, "I imagine myself giving a lecture to 200 people and post for Vienna, at this moment I was dissociated, I wasn't in the moment," and body move through that trauma in the way that most of us don't. We do get frozen in that moment and here it was in-- and I'm in California giving a lecture to 7,000 people. He made that vision become reality as he didn't get stuck in the moment but move through it and so, I think that fu-- I call that future foe is having people connect to such a compelling future that they move through the stuckness from the trauma and you know, a lot of our clients I'm sure the-- that my colleagues have had this experience where, you know, they tell us such horrendous things you think. How do they keep going through that? They say, "Well, I wanna be a social worker and help other people to her trauma, 'til they have a future their living into that calls them through the trauma in some way gives a motivation and also a vision for the future, a sense to that future." And the last general category is what I learn-- I learned-- actually I learned this Erickson when I learn hypnosis but I use it in non-hypnotic way. I call it inclusion that is to get people permission to, to and not to have to. And then, sometimes to and not to at the same time so you can be numb and you don't have to be a numb. You can be numb and you can feel. You can forget and you can remember and you can remember to forget. And sometimes, we as therapist take a side, you have to remember to heal and then, they have a reaction to that as like thing on a seesaw. I don't wanna remember or they do remember they go overwhelm with their memories. So I like to give the both sides to the yin and the yang and to permissions. It's okay to and you don't have to. And it's okay to and not at the same time simultaneously, which is an interesting thing and I wanna dive from Erickson doing hypnosis and then I started using an outside the hypnotic context and people found out quite dissolving shame and disconnection is-- that was my experience. So, uhm, I'll just give one example, you know, that I think for probably, ah, illustrate what Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Shapiro ha-- or have talked about, uhm, I had a neighbor who was a friend of mine who live a couple house away. She's a physician and, and I play the music and one day I came over and she was playing guitar. I never see her playing music before and I said, "Oh, you're playing guitar." She say, "I'm taking a guitar lessons, sir." "Oh, good for you. That's cool." You know, she was 50 some years old, 58 years old and I like, "Wow, that's you first music?" "Yeah." "Well, she said no, I actually I tried piano lessons a few years ago and it didn't work out." "Why not?" She say, "I really want to play piano but my mother was a piano teacher when I was a kid and she with the-- she was originally from Switzerland," and her mother was really harsh. This very punitive person and she was a piano teacher and she was very precise and she thought her three children to play-- her three daughters to play piano and she were just be like doing the housework or cooking the meal whatever and she will come through and if they make a mistake she'd hit them on the side of the head, really hard and my friend was the oldest daughter. When she was 12, she rebelled and said, "I'm not gonna play. I can't do this and you-- and so, you know, hurt by this. I don't wanted it," and she had big fight with her mother and she refused. The other two daughters continued to play. They're beautiful pianist now as, as adults and she never learned to play. She said she went to a piano lesson about two years before cuz you really want to play piano not guitar and she sat on the bench and the piano teacher started and she made a first mistake and she went like this. She flinched. The piano teacher look to her a little strange and then she went on and she made another mistake and she flinched again. The piano se-- said, "What, what is happening?" She told the story. My mother hit me and you know, she's about-- I think that's a terrible way to teach people. I will never hit. It didn't matter after three months they gave up the piano lessons because the teacher was so disturbed. She had this non-voluntary response that was a recreation of this mo-- at this time in her childhood and she is a very smart person, she knew where it came from, she knew-- she didn't need to be afraid of this teacher and still it was automatic and it didn't-- no matter what she told herself, no matter what she thought it didn't stop. And I think that's the kind of thing we see in therapy that you see in therapy is this no matter what kind of insight they get, no matter how clear they get on what it is and that the present situation is not dangerous it doesn't make deadly difference. It doesn't do a thing for to know that and I think that's why we've all been searching for what can help people get unstuck from the automatic twitch of you know, however it shows up, all right. 

00:24:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Please continue. I like that. Uhm, the other last piece really got me I was-- I'm not sure if I'm going to talk about it. Anyway, uhm, is that people think about the trauma is something out them and a story that needs to be resolved and so I think by the most important things I learned over time and I've learned this much from Peter Levine as anybody is that the trauma of the idea at one point is over. It's gone, it's done with irrelevant. It leaves on inside of yourself and so, all trauma work is done right now, right here and the more you tell stories, the less you go to get better. Here's number one. And so, the enemy lives within and because the enemy lives within, the danger is not outside, the danger is inside and so, traumatized people live in an volcano, they can't trust themselves and they don't know what's going to happen, and they, they don't know when they're going to get scared, they don't know when it going to explore, they don't know when they go to collapse and that makes him feel wounded, ashamed, damaged goods, no good. Uhm, so this morning was a panel the shame that people have about the traumatic event. You know, well, yes, maybe sometimes but the real of shame to be a person who cannot know where himself for herself as a person who can't know herself and trust herself because the inside is not safe. Now, you keep on reacting to the world's as if your endanger and you'd know that you're not endanger but it does make any difference. And so, the point that Francine was trying to make as she's trying to push her to do EMDR which is her job, uhm, is that people need to feel safe enough to discover themselves and feel, feel their inside. For me, ah, EMDR was the, the gateway into learning about trauma treatment. It didn't stop there. I-- I'm not a religious person. I don't believe in EMDR. I don't believe in as E and W, any of these things, I seek it first and I was-- I'm a researcher and they see that something works to reach out that when we need to, ah, and I made found that EMDR study up to now is still the only and I made from the study of EMDR to induct to be the best study to be the outcome ever done. EMDR work better than anything else that one time trauma 80% of people got better and nothing up to now has done that. Say a ratio on this, so how-- but how-- what makes it happen? Well, for me it's just interesting because I was a professor at Harvard at the time very sure. I'm trying to be respectable and now, we are wiggling our fingers in front of people's eyes and my colleague said, "Oh my god, this has gone off to the event." People say that all time about people. He's got all to depend again to this girls, to depend, and depend. Now, he's doing yoga, and solved to depend, uhm, hypnosis off to depend. You cannot-- not determine if it unless you off to defense. I can assure you and everything is different. Everything is different from a just school book failure. So, if we do EMDR and we find this extraordinary results but to find the extraordinary results in one time trauma people and that the question is that what does it do? What does EMDR do and why that you have the spectacular success with EMDR? We don't know, they're actually about to start a very serious neuroscience investigation in EMDR. So year from now, as you've had-- have the answers to it. Uhm, but it has to do what we know at this point is this eye movements change the activation to brain and makes the brain quite but I think the big issues is to make the brain quite enough so that people have to courage to go there. As he keep notions and tosses, as he tapping do it and-- well, for me, it's interesting is there scie-- if some friends right now who have-- are doing FDA approved treatment of PTSD with ecstasy. Uhm, and again, it's going off to depend of ecstasy and I saw the results. The results are as good as our EMDR study possibly better Francine. 

00:29:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I know, darling. 

00:29:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, possibly better and that makes perfect sense to me because when you take ecstasy which I've never know than myself and I've labeled another things to feel completely safe inside. And so, once you feel safe inside, you're able to go and visit whatever. And once you feel safe inside it is safe to visit any aspect of your life and to look at it and to see what happened and to know that was then and this is now and at the end, all good treatments of PTSD have that fundamental capacity to make it possible for people to visit themselves, to know themselves and to know what just happened as if EMDR is just one of those. For me EMDR was the gateway through which I realized to do something as to do see the things to get people better. Ah, it was something if this works and something if this works and some time standing on one foot and yoga poses that works. There's many ways of getting there but the fundamental thing is that you have to neutralized that enemy that's living inside, living inside your body. So, our patients continue to have the stuff inside to them and behind your activity at any particular point. So they, they can't go inside. Here's this second-- third person today who I heard about-- talking about to post-traumatic growth. I'm suspicious about the idea of post-traumatic approach. I think it has something to do oftentimes in a people have a hard time hearing the two horror of our-- for that patient goes through and like to guild the lily a little bit. I'd like to say, it was at all a bit. I know, numerous people who are traumatized who doing extremely well. I have had three MacArthur Prize winners in my private factories. You see them in New York Times very famous people, traumatized as hell. You go home to tangle themselves, got themselves weird stuff. So the thing is that we are not a unitary people, we are have parts and a part of us can be extraordinarily functional and get away but, but if we were doing this and I'm still very curious how many traumatized people have a particularly skillful way of being in the world. I sometime suspected some of the-- many of the great discoveries in the world have been made by very traumatized people who could-- who no longer sort of accepts things for what they are but they had to find their way on the extraordinarily difficult situations and the process of cloying their way over there trauma have discovered extraordinary things. And-- but discovering extraordinary things doesn't mean that, that thing that's inside of you has gone. And so, even though you maybe a highly functional person, you may still in your private life be a very traumatized human being and so, most important here is that what you see is not necessarily what you get and what people know about themselves is not necessarily what to get either because traumatized people become experts in running away from the internal reality and that opened up in the next step after EMDR. Uhm, and that is that many of our traumatized people shutdown their ability-- talking about this already-- shutdown, uhm, awareness of themselves then to awareness-- bodily awareness because the internal world is filled to this-- it's a mind field and so in feeling your and knowing yourself is a dangerous thing. And so, the first thing we discovered was how does it in people's bodies? And that many of our traumatized people which most people who go psychology or psychiatry or social work school don't know much about our body because we're always yacking and that forgetting that there is something below that little sliver over here. Uhm, let me discover that people sometimes don't feel whole part of their bodies, they don't feel themselves, they don't know themselves. They may-- they oftentimes com-- completely a sensual. They feel no sensations in their bodies or they all is very true that people get very excited about something like cigarettes in their arms or getting very excited about bitten or hit. Uhm, all part of the drama just stuff that they're sitting there that's unacceptable and that is dissociated off and, uhm, list in the inside. So, aside from dealing with specific traumatic memories, a very important part of dealing with trauma is to get to know yourself very well and that's consist of knowing your body very well, feeling your be-- body very deeply, uhm, and that means sitting still and noticing what goes in your body and allowing yourself to feel everything, very difficult to do cuz traumatized people are terrified about what you will find. The bad news in this regard is that in the past 20 years or so, uhm, neuroscience is getting pretty good in how-- in understanding how we can change and we make up of our deep animal survival brain and what we have learned is that you cannot get there by understanding an insight. There's still a more psychological schools paper and maybe some of you come to these schools where people say that you should just point out to people how irrational their behavior and beliefs are. I find it just bizarre. I have-- my wife is trying to do it on me. I have tried it on my teenage kids. I have tried it on my colleagues. I have never been able to talk since other people, ah, into people who have had irrational be-- it's just doesn't work. You cannot convince people that there are just-- that it just too big or you shouldn't sink a bit, doesn't work of it. Have reality doesn't matter I see it at this figure again, everyone is arguing with each other and that we cares about effect and so you cannot really change your emotional brains but inside an understanding you have to sort of go deeper than that and do lymphatic system therapy and the only way you can do that is deeply feeling yourself and knowing yourself and that means you need to activate a particular part of your brain that we look before the projects that gains-- allows you to gain access to the internal world. I'm on things I'm really curious about is when we do our EMDR stuff which will start in a week. Uhm, but if you'll see lighting up of the medial pre-frontal cortex which are very interesting because that is going to master area of your brain very much activating hypnosis also from which you can know-- it's sort of a-- it's a platform from which you can notice the internal world. If you activate it by doing a law of hypnosis a lot of meditational yoga, you can grow the part of your brain and by doing that to become more of a master of your ownership. The tragedy is that when you get traumatized and the earlier and more often you get traumatized, the more that pilot that internal much person in your brain is damaged and the more traumatized you are, the less you have the capacity to observe yourself, feel yourself, know to yourself and steal yourself was in. And so, I was here about all these great treatments but at the end, we are left with, uhm, our population we run in my organization about so largest a sort of to treatment program for abused and abandoned and orphaned and stuff kids. In Massachusetts, I called and this treatment doesn't work and EMDR doesn't do much either, yoga is not bad. Uhm, yeah, uhm, but what your dealing with is people whose arousal system in their brain is so disturbed and who are so run by by fear and terror and confusion and disorientation that they don't know where to go and, uhm, now we have treated some of this people and they can tell us in retrospect they will say, "I couldn't really feed anybody's presence because I was so preoccupied to this. My internal stuff, my fear, my terror and all that stuff that's going inside of me and even if someone who is very nice to me I couldn't really take in the-- this person was really being good to me," and a very large substantial number of traumatize people have brains that are so disorganized and so all over the place that I think this therapeutic relationship as we have all learned as and I bet that many of us have many good in forming good therapeutic relationships. Don't-- you can't breach the gap because the receptors for the milk of human kindness had not being developed. Ah, if the people who were supposed to take care of you have become the sources of danger and terror your whole brain is reorganized in order to somehow survive against by hook or by crook or you made to a greatest computers of people become a traumatic trigger but it's a huge thing for it-- all of us because we all believe that our kindness and goodness and sweetness can help our patient so this might-- that's-- of-- if it doesn't the case. So, what do you do is to people are fundamentally too confused, too dissociated, too aggravated, too terrified to make use of relationship and so, that's by latest research it's, uhm, a neural feedback. Ah, to be-- I'll talk about tomorrow in very detail, ah, that we could actually is-- we have such a thing as applied neuroscience. We can actually understand what happens in the brain and we can also begin to learn how we can change the brain and we can change the brain, brain-- the same brain that we can, ah, change become better musicians, are hearing ourselves play and working with the feedback that it actually become better by picking up feedback our brains get also reform themselves by picking up feedback gonna be though to become alive or more focus and alert and calm. Uhm, so that's very meant, uhm, but so that the to some race what I'm trying to say is that, there are some fantastically helpful treatments like hypnosis which is actually to do with all this treatment for PTSD, ah, for over 100 years PTSD was always treated with hypnosis and it somehow they falls memory foundation comes in there, ah, probably of therapist as a all hypnosis terrible treatment to just implant false memories in people's minds. I still seemed that Milton Erickson probably was the best trauma therapist ever was about for what I know. Ah, so it does a sort of a big work. EMDR a fantastic treatment, cosmetic therapist does treatment. Uhm, so there is not one notion that if you degrade thing above being a therapist to this field and she go to school and you learn enough skills to hangout your shill-- shingles and you can now practice. I think very few people learn stuff at school that's really got to be helpful for your patients and in for the first 10 years after you finish in training, you try to gain favor with your-- all your teachers and you say, "Ah, got them. I was very good because my patients are doing very well." And soon as you discover actually what I learned was little helpful and he start going to take courses. He learned EMDR was great. A lot of your patient will get better and you discover that some of your patients don't get better and you go and nurse something else and just as your kids leave home to go college, and you think what the hell are we gonna do? She let my life, you learn something else and you may learn hypnosis or like we started to run to see other groups, one of my favorite therapeutic activity for traumatize people is to run to see other groups and I may talk about it a little bit of that tomorrow, uhm, but how internal be powerful it is to do theater with other people. So there's many ways of getting there but as usually it's not the stuff you load in school. Thank you.

00:42:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO You know, I'd, I'd like to second, to second this notion that we really need to integrate treatments. I would suggest everyone learn hypnosis. It's a absolutely wonderful tool to have and being able to recognize the empirically support the treatments and to make sure that you used those and take a look at the newest of what's coming out in neuroscience and one of things that I'd like to be able to communicate by the way, in terms of client understanding and engaging the client i that there is no shame to having PTSD that there that-- it's not-- you should snap out of it and we now-- PTSD is not in the anxiety disorders anymore and the DSM-5 you know. It's in, ah, separate category of trauma and stressor-related and the thing I do not like about that category is that stressor-related piece is lumped in to mostly to an-- to adjustment disorders which kind of feeds that notion that people have or you should be able to snap out of it, that wasn't so bad. We all go through that when again, according to the research this early negative childhood experiences can generate as many symptoms as major trauma and they have long lasting effect. So if you're able to get across to our client that this is a physical problem, this is the way, the ex-- you didn't ask for the experience, you didn't, you didn't call and say, "Do this to me when I was a child," but this experience is being stored in your brain in a way that is not allow you to change. It's not your fault. This is a physical problem and you'd have not stigma going to, ah, attach to going to a physician if you broke your leg, you would you know, align it. Put it in the cast and the healing could take place. This is exactly the same as going in for mental health therapy. You're going in to get what is needed, realigned in your brain system and allowing that movement to take place for healing. So I think part of what we need to do is empower the people that walk in to our office to know that yes this is a good place to be, this is a no blame place to be and with having establish the relationship move in to what work says efficiently as possible and use all the tools necessary for more debilitated clients whatever is necessary, we need to find them. 

00:44:40

00:44:45
BILL O'HANLON I, I think that, uhm, when I-- what I've heard from both of my colleagues I want, uhm, sort of go mad and see if I can summarize it and it seems to me that what we were taught is you just develop a good relationship and talk to people they get inside in the way the trauma came from and they-- they will get better and we discovered after one or 10 years of treatments that seems to work so well and I think there are two key elements then, one is experience. It has to get in there experience somehow not just in their thoughts and you know, so that could be through yoga, could be through eye movements, could be tapping, it could be through, uhm, you know, I know one of your colleagues using molecular or, uhm, you know, or acupuncture. It somehow has to get in to experience. It can't just be an idea or a conversation, if the conversation gets into experience that can make a difference which is great and occasionally conversation gets a new experience. You tell a story, you do hypnosis and something shifts experientially and I think that se-- 

00:45:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Being seen in nowhere is an important thing. 

00:45:50
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:45:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK That isn't experience of itself. 

00:45:50
BILL O'HANLON That-- yeah, if they actually can take any experience which is what you're saying sometimes are not available in taking that experience and I think that the second thing is connection and you know, internal connection, external connection you said they are so frightened of getting of, of touching and connecting with that stuff that you know, all the techniques that-- you know, it's a really a renaissance time in trauma treatment. We,-- you know, it was by 100 years begin talking if there be a hypnosis. That was been and maybe drug therapy a little but now where all this new explorations and I think it's a great time to-- because we finally realize, it's not working too well like out drug and alcohol treatment doesn't work too well, works with a certain percentage of people but most people it's not working very well. Let's come up with some new ideas and Bill Moyers here coming up with motivational interviewing you know, still not working as well, we're not getting to 100% of people, we're not getting to 100% of the traumatized people so we're coming up with the new things but to me they do fall on the category of experience, changing, you know, it really has to get people experience and connection approaches whatever that because we know that this connection of dissociation is really one of the prime experiences in the wake of trauma and so, you know, maybe, you know, friends-- they would say you're connected to right left hemispheres it's the internal connections and hopefully if they're available to external connections which I think relationships can be healing if people are available for them and some people, you know, my goal has this whole thing. Let's hear your trauma in the, in the context of a marriage, of a relationship and if you're available to that I think connection internally and externally can be really, really healing, that's what I have to see we all have in common. Now, what two, two categories have become to five more but that was the ones come to mind when I hear my colleagues stuff. 

00:47:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Any questions was in all perfect hearing. 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Can I, ah, ask the first question? 

00:47:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Sure. 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN If there's anyone on our panel that would that care to, ah, speak to the emerging research on, ah, memory reconsolidation and I know that this is now being look at in trauma therapies and, ah, what your feelings all about that? 

00:48:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah, but I don't think as particularly exciting news whenever you bring something up and change-- and something changes. And so, ah, yeah, so if you let the air in-- things that oxidizing but that-- that's really not dramatically new information. The thing for your traumatize is you dissociate of your trauma and it doesn't consciously come back actually also what's, what's deserving to me and so, I usually talk trauma and I have the sense that they never see a trauma to this patient like when you are traumatize stuff just emergencies are nowhere and you start behaving and acting, your hormones gets secreted that makes you be back there not even consciously but you're body is like, ah, kid as being raped again or like a person being insulted again. You may not know, what the origin of it, you just go back just an old memory of reconsolidation because in old memory you're not remembering any said you're, you're reliving it and the core issue with trauma is that trauma is about reliving, it's not remembering and so, at the end of an effective treatment people remember and to beginning people reenact, you know, what he first said, ah, Sigmund Freud 1893, he was absolutely right. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Uhm, I have a question could you address, uhm, EMDR with children and adolescents? 

00:49:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Yeah, there-- EMDR by the way isn't-- not just eye movement, it's an eight phase treatment approach and there's standardize procedures that are used. And so, with children you have to simplify them. So, in-- you'd be using simple statements say in describe for instances in adulthood, ah, negative cognition, positive cognition for children, it's a good thoughts, bad thoughts. For subjective units of the stress and measurement to zero to 10 for an adult and it's an analog scale for child to be able to point maybe using puppet in order to caught your eyes for or using taps because that's easier, they can't go across the midline. So, there's a whole variety of ways in which the pro-- protocols have simplified and, as, ah, tape that I, I showed earlier this week it's also been used with intellectually delayed, ah, developmentally, ah, developmentally delayed children that you can simplify at-- that much so that really no one needs to be left behind 

00:50:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK That's pretty good. 

00:50:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO You know. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN And training where, where did you get training for that? 

00:50:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO You can check with, ah, EMDR International Association if you're in North America and the EMDR Asia in Asia et cetera. There is a-- they-- they're probably have a booth down here. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Me, thank you. Uhm, I'm, I'm confused. Uhm, we've been working with adolescents who'd been-- who have had a traumatic episode yet they seemed to be traumatized by the trauma, uhm, not by the specific episode but by the, the effects of that so they drop out of school. They've, they've hide in their room, they're call to come down and, and integrate with their family and that's what their reenacting when they coming they-- they'll not saying, "Oh, the operation I'm scared of the operation. I'm re-- reliving that." They're saying, "I was reminded or I'd been relieving, you know, we've got a family event this weekend and I'm scared about what's gonna happen or we went," uhm, so I don't know if that's developmental, developmental trauma that's come from the original traumatic episode. Uhm, could you comment from that? 

00:51:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, when a child went on a adolescent, he has been traumatized in that way, what we're saying basically as it's stored in the brain on process, the emotions, the physical sensations, the beliefs are there. It doesn't mean that the image of the event has to keep coming up but anytime, anything in the present is-- it has to link up with their memory networks to be made sense of. So the idea of going out and doing something is linking to a network for instance that has the emotion verbalize as I'm not good enough, I'm not in control. I'm not safe. I'm not powerful. And so, that's the feeling that's coming up and when that's happening they're withdrawing. So in general, what you're looking at or all of the-- the isolation that can occur the alienation that can occur, identify the earlier memory, the critical incident that you know existed, process that memory and what happens in processing is that learning takes place. The appropriate associations entirely are made. And so, it moves from that being locked up in trauma and I'm not good enough into a level of resilient like a rape victim for instance going from, ah, I'm a whore, I'm must have wanted it, I, I wasn't good enough, I called it on myself or I'm not sick moves into I'm a strong resilient woman. Look, look what I went through, you see. So in, in-- it moves it a new sense of self-emerges as the processing occurs and these other experiences, these other reenactments can fall off on their own. You-- in the EMDR if they don't you target them separately the last time they went out and, and had a negative experience you process that and then the third part is a imagining being able to enjoy it, to speak appropriately et cetera and imagine doing that in the future. So you're going three-pronged in all of this to make sure that everything is basically handled but I would definitely make sure that you process that earliest that critical incident. 

00:54:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK That it's just a-- sometimes people get very pervasively terrified and isolate because of trauma and sometimes EMDR works to the kid like you described but not always. You cannot get to it or they me-- they had made that from the relationship with you. Once you get into perineal state of terror and fear and shutdown the relationship no longer works because the terror dominates the relationship and gets to the way at that point you start seeking partner of feedback and be-- start being comparing to your own brain that can make your own brain feel safer and calmer 'til the world becomes a less terrifying place for you not about a particular event but a terror that keeps you frozen inside, that keeps your room, uhm, may soon dissipate and you may become open and about door of outside of yourself and I think that's additional psychotherapeutic message may not help these kids together and so it's important to again to expand your, ah, capabilities into other things besides your traditional psychotherapeutic message for free. 

00:55:10
BILL O'HANLON And I'll had one more thing. 

00:55:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah. 

00:55:10
BILL O'HANLON And that is I think that's why we're up here and that's why your here because there had been so many people with untreated trauma and it starts to create cascading other things like developmental delays and problems in the relationship, in occupational problems just like long term untreated depression or psychotic problems. They start to have a lot more problems so we're just saying, let's get more effective at this, get earlier and then do some prevention you know, send people right to the trauma site, afterwards and doing effective treatments so we don't see these cascading changes. That's why we're all about. I think that's why we all wanna do this work. 

00:55:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Over there, yeah. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN Hi! Thank you. Ah, I have a question, uhm, about working with clients. Uhm, so-- sometimes the client-- cli-- clients have trauma that's in the past and, uhm, they're currently safe but sometimes clients are living, uhm, with potentially ongoing daily trauma such as in the case of parents who are caring for her children who are ill and, and I'm wondering if you guys can comment on how do you work with clients who are continuously living with the fear or the experiences of dealing with potentially repeating traumas with that experience? 

00:56:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Anything that can-- you cannot do anything unless you feel safe. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Uhm, exactly. 

00:56:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And you feel quietly avoided. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Uhm-huh. 

00:56:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And so, you need to do something to feel that safety empowering your body, maybe taking boxing lessons might be helpful doing karate, ah, martial arts, not so much for the aggressive part but in order to-- you know, since Nelson Mandela dieds-- died last year. I've just talked with him about, about 15 years ago and I asked him to what he strive his-- in meeting safe in his coming out 27 years of, of being a prison. And said, the secret most helpful thing was boxing. It took me aback cuz I'd never thought about boxing as a helpful therapeutic enterprise and from endu-- neuroscience point of view it makes perfect sense because you cannot engage in this sort of things without having a deep sense of, you know, what's going on with me, that's what I'm seeing a dare and to really focus on, be still in your body in order to anticipate the movement of your opponents and then to very fast, in a and very rate start moving in order to dock it that's exactly the opposite of being traumatized. Being traumatized you're always danger, you're never quiet, you're never observing and so, I, I'd like-- I worked (inaudible ) Japan. I really try to encourage my Japanese colleagues to stay with their Japanese martial arts because it's the only thing for event to deal with trauma because they exactly, ah, ah, uhm, going to the part of their brain that help people to focus, to be attentive, to be mindful and to anticipate both your own and other people feelings. And so, a very different from psychology schools but so if the person is living in a constantly dangerous environment have to do things that make their body still competent and safe. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN Even if they don't believe it in their mind? 

00:58:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Well, for instance, in the-- in EMDR therapy the second phase is preparation and you don't proceed to a process say unless until the client is able to evoke a state change. So you're teaching a variety of different techniques that allows them to notice how their feeling, identify the anxiety or the pain or the fear and use the techniques in order to shift it into a state of calm, into a sense of safety choose or courage whatever is best for them. So all of that goes along with the notion of empowering the client calming themselves, knowing that they can calm themselves and then moving into processing, isn't-- as Bessel mentioned earlier this is about canal of emotion that's going on and so what you have when you're saying at unsafe environment you're in the potential for having this pain or else, you see? 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Uhm-huh. 

00:59:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So the notion of allowing them to prepare, bringing to a state of resilience of adaptability of a flexibility so that they have a sense they will be able to handle and, and do what they need to do under that circumstance. 

00:59:45
BILL O'HANLON I-- I'll just say one more thing about that. I think my best training for having, ah, for recovering from trauma, dealing with trauma was being raised as Catholic and that is that I learned to dissociate really well. You know, I maybe a good hypnotic subject later because I had dissociated so many times and as long as it's not your only option to dissociate if you can dissociated and then not dissociate that's the prim because there are times when dissociation is the appropriate response to the moment but what happens again what I said earlier is they get stuck in that mode of coping which doesn't resolve and it just helps you cope in the moment and so, I think there are preventative thing if you know people are gonna repetitively re-- you know, expose to trauma and you know, obviously got to get them you know, to somebody being beaten at home and you do a great treatment with them and they go home and get beaten, that's not so helpful. They knew to an environmental and you know, get amount to that situation, get them safe not internally but externally and that's I think that you know, you start to get psychological. I, I was went on an suicide crisis line and someone call up and said, "My husband get drunk. He beat me. He went to bar and says he gonna come home and beat me to death," and I said, "You call the wrong the person. I'm a therapist. I would asked you how you feel about that not get out of the house, call the police, go get somebody to help you, you know, that you're talking to the wrong person at this moment, go get safe and then we'll talk about your trauma." 

01:01:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's why I had this question cuz there's no way to be safe, you've got that, you're living in that so that's why I was really wondering but I will do appreciate all your comments. Thank you so much. 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN Thank you, yeah. Uhm, unfortunately we're out of time. Good day. Thank you so much for our panel and so the audience. 

01:01:25
