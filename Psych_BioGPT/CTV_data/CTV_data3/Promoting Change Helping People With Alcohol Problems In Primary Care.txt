Videlicet DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY THE UNIVERSITY of MANCHESTER PROMOTING CHANGE- helping people with alcohol problems in primary care Linda Gask Part 1 The Model 

00:00:00
LINDA GASK  We're going to look at the set of behavioral skills and strategies that can be useful in promoting behavior change. On the video, the doctors that you will see are played by real general practitioners and the patients played by actors. There'll also be the opportunity for you to hear the views of one of the actors or patients, herself, later in the tape. There'll also be an opportunity for you to practice some of the skills and strategies that we demonstrate. Although we used doctors in this tape, there's absolutely no reason why other people working as therapists such as practice nurses shouldn't use some of the skills that we'll show. The tape refers specifically to people with alcohol problems but the skills are also generalizable to other situations that you might find yourself within primary care such as trying to help someone to see that they need to stop smoking or to diet or to obtain better control of their diabetes. The model has three stages: Clarifying the person's view of the problems, exploring the necessity for change, and promoting resolution. Now, let's look at the first patient. 

00:01:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Ms. Power(ph). 

00:01:30
SUE POWER Yes. 

00:01:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS What can I do for you? 

00:01:30
SUE POWER  Uhm, I'm not sure really. That, there's nothing wrong. Just, it's just that I've been feeling quite rundown and tired recently. Uhm, I just don't seem to have a flow of energy enough during the day. 

00:01:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:01:45
SUE POWER  Uhm, I only wanted if anything (inaudible ) you know, if it's worth taking for someone insofar or something like that. 

00:01:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS How long you felt like that? 

00:01:55
SUE POWER  Uhm, well, I suppose it's quite a few months now, six months at least. 

00:02:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS Really? It seems like it's quite a while. 

00:02:05
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Anything to stop that stuff(ph)? 

00:02:10
SUE POWER  No, I don't think so. I think, ah, I think at first I probably just thought I got overtired, you know, I've been working quite hard and ah, but it's not actually getting any better. 

00:02:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. What is your job? 

00:02:25
SUE POWER  I do telesales, yeah. Well, I work for an agency so it's, it's hard you know, I may work in different, different places. 

00:02:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. Are you working full-time? 

00:02:40
SUE POWER Yes, yeah I do. Although that, that shouldn't really made me feel tired but I know about six months ago, I had been doing quite a lot of extra hours. 

00:02:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
SUE POWER But I'm not anymore. 

00:02:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
SUE POWER I don't seem to be feeling any better for it. 

00:02:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Were you working after the extra hours then? 

00:02:55
SUE POWER Uhm, a few, yeah. It was a busy time so I, I was taking on the extra hours but I'm not been doing that for a while. 

00:03:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
SUE POWER And ah, but I still feel quite drained. 

00:03:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
LINDA GASK Further into the consultation, the doctor picks up some key cues for alcohol and demonstrates skills necessary to make a good rapport. 

00:03:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Do you get anytime for yourself? 

00:03:25
SUE POWER Oh, yeah. I mean, David's certainly he's not where he's, he's actually not about a lot of the time, you know, he sort of comes and goes pretty enough to see, I see places. 

00:03:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:03:35
SUE POWER  Uhm, Karen's at home but she studies quite a lot, you know she's quite hardworking. 

00:03:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:03:45
SUE POWER And she spends time with her father. 

00:03:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:03:45
SUE POWER You know, in Sunday I really like try to get, call him quite a bit sometimes, you know. 

00:03:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
SUE POWER  I mean, Karen might be in the house... (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:03:55
SUE POWER ...but she's busy. 

00:03:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS You spending time with yourself, yes? (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS  What do you do to relax? You, you're doing a very intense job with dealing with people all the time. 

00:04:00
SUE POWER Yes. 

00:04:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS  What do you do to relax? 

00:04:05
SUE POWER Ah, well, about, really by the time I've got home from work, uhm, I cook supper and I'll clean up a bit and things like that. Most of the time, I just put my feet and watch tele for a bit or read a book. Uh, Uh hmm. 

00:04:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:04:20
SUE POWER I'm been doing that. I see friends from time to time but. 

00:04:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
SUE POWER Really by the, by the end of the day, that I'm just ready for, to switch off a bit, really. 

00:04:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Right. 

00:04:30
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:04:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes, yes. Can you unwind in that way? 

00:04:35
SUE POWER  Well, yeah, I mean, it can be odd sometimes depending on what kind of day I've had or... (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:04:40
SUE POWER ...or what's happening with, with kids. Uhm, being in a way(ph), I'd, I'd find a couple of drinks and just put my feet to read a book or watch tele. 

00:04:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
SUE POWER I usually used to be on a (inaudible ) before I go to bed. 

00:04:57
DR. BARRY LEWIS Right. 

00:04:57
SUE POWER  And I go off to sleep all right. 

00:05:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
SUE POWER You know, so it's not that, that, that's why I really don't understand this feeling so drained. 

00:05:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
SUE POWER And I'm, I'm not off very late really... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
SUE POWER ...and I'm usually in the bed by about 11 or something like that. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
SUE POWER Unless I go out somewhere. 

00:05:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Sometimes, just being on depression can make you feel tired. 

00:05:15
SUE POWER Uh hmm, yeah. 

00:05:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS You said you had a couple of drinks. How much are you actually drinking? 

00:05:25
SUE POWER Uhm, I don't know really. I don't really count for how much... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:05:30
SUE POWER ...open a bottle of wines or something. 

00:05:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
SUE POWER A few drinks. 

00:05:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
SUE POWER Then go to bed. 

00:05:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS All right. 

00:05:35
SUE POWER  Then sometimes I'm getting plenty of sleep. 

00:05:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes, yes. Otherwise, physically, do you feel all right? 

00:05:45
Clarifying the person's view of the problems Build rapport eye-contact listening picking up cues, verbal and non-verbal empathic comments 

00:05:45
LINDA GASK A number of skills can be very useful in building rapport: making good eye contact, clearly demonstrating but you're listening and are prepared to listen, picking up verbal and non-verbal cues and making empathic comments. It's very important to remain neutral with respect to the problem behavior. In this interview, the doctor goes back a little later to alcohol. He clarified that the patient isn't depressed and he sensitively checks out the quantity of alcohol that she's actually drinking. 

00:06:20
SUE POWER You know, I'm not doing more than I usually do but I do feel. 

00:06:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Right, right. Not right? 

00:06:30
SUE POWER Just, yeah. 

00:06:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes, yes. 

00:06:30
SUE POWER (coughs) 

00:06:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Well, sorts of things can do that and part of it as a, as pointed out might have been just feeling low but it doesn't sound as though you're feeling low all the time. 

00:06:40
SUE POWER  No, I'm not. 

00:06:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. Over a week, are you regularly having the drinks each night? 

00:06:50
SUE POWER  Uhm, oh, yeah, I do, I do much in most nights. 

00:06:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. Does that help you relax? 

00:07:00
SUE POWER Yeah, definitely. 

00:07:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:07:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS  So, a matter(ph) of couple of drinks? 

00:07:05
SUE POWER  Uhm, well, I have the bottled wine. 

00:07:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS All right. 

00:07:10
SUE POWER  It's usually, it's what I usually drink unless I go out somewhere... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS If. 

00:07:15
SUE POWER ...with friends it's something like that, anyway, I'm gonna drink something else but usually, I just have a bottle of wine. 

00:07:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS And just one, yes. Do you finish that yourself? 

00:07:25
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah, sometimes. But I don't feel, you know, I don't get, not really drunk or anything. 

00:07:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS I'm sure not 'coz you're only (inaudible ) that out of the evening... (crosstalk) 

00:07:38
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah. 

00:07:38
DR. BARRY LEWIS  As well, yes. It can still be part of the cause of feeling tired. Is that something that you've considered at all? 

00:07:45
SUE POWER  No, I don't really, I mean, I don't have hangovers you know, I don't feel like... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yeah. 

00:07:55
SUE POWER ...chill out, when you, when really have so much to drink and you feel lousy the next days. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:00
SUE POWER It, it's not feeling like that. It's more, just, ah, it's just like I need a boost to get me going, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
SUE POWER ...that kind of feeling. 

00:08:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS But we all use alcohol as a way of not having the boost, as unwinding. 

00:08:15
SUE POWER Yeah, I mean, in the day but I mean I don't drink in the day. 

00:08:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm, no, no. But it can have a knock on effect. That's what I was asking. 

00:08:20
SUE POWER  Oh, I see. But always drunk really, you know, I mean.(crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:08:30
SUE POWER And this is. 

00:08:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Has it increase? 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:35
SUE POWER  Well, I suppose I drink more than I did. (inaudible ) have to say. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
SUE POWER But not more but I suppose when I'm, when I'm still living with Ted I didn't drink every night. Though we would, you know, we would have drink. 

00:08:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:08:55
SUE POWER I think I went out more than. 

00:08:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS All right. 

00:08:55
SUE POWER  Well, I mean, I don't, perhaps as bit but not. (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm, Uh hmm. It's a nice easy available way of unwinding. 

00:09:10
LINDA GASK The doctor goes on in this interview to check out various aspects of the drinking history that draw(ph) so important. It establishes that she's not drinking during the day and that she doesn't have any severe withdrawal symptoms in the mornings. If the topic of the problem behavior isn't already on the agenda, it's important to raise it sensitively and obtain clear information non-judgmentally. In this interview, the problem behavior, what was mentioned when the doctor has explored it sensitively. Then you move on to draw up the person's problem list from that point of view with priorities. You need to discuss with the person whether they consider the behavior to be a problem. 

00:09:50
Does anyone else see the behaviour as a problem? Negotiate whether the behaviour should be discussed further. 

00:09:50
LINDA GASK Does anyone else? And then it's important to negotiate whether to discuss the behavior any further, either in this consultation or in a further consultation. 

00:10:00
Summarises 

00:10:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS  You're saying you feel tired... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:10:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS ...it sounds as though you're not eating very well certainly in the mornings. And, and grabbing a quick lunch because you're under a lot of pressure. 

00:10:10
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:10:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS  I think I am a little bit concerned about the total amount of alcohol that you're having. Even though obviously, it's not giving you great problems. It might be a reason for feeling slowdown and just not on top of things in the way that you'd like to be. 

00:10:25
SUE POWER  Great. I think I, didn't think I was drinking that much, you know that it would ah. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
Negotiation 

00:10:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Sometimes, you can actually sit down and just add up how much you're actually drinking. 

00:10:40
SUE POWER Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS  And if each glass is going to be a unit. 

00:10:45
SUE POWER  Yeah, another. 

00:10:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:10:50
SUE POWER What you call it (inaudible ). 

00:10:53
DR. BARRY LEWIS That's right, yes. Does it sound as though that's a, somehow we should go with it? 

00:11:00
SUE POWER  I don't know. I mean, I mean, it's something that Karen nags me about. 

00:11:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Did she? 

00:11:10
SUE POWER Yes, she does. But then I think she's at the age where she'd find something to find fault with whatever I do, really. 

00:11:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS All right. 

00:11:15
Picks up verbal cue 

00:11:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS In what way she'd been nagging you? 

00:11:15
SUE POWER  Who she (inaudible ) and you won't drink anything at the moment, you know. 

00:11:21
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
SUE POWER That is? 

00:11:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:11:25
SUE POWER Uhm, it smells disgusting on it, you know and all this and... (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
SUE POWER ...or when you're drinking again, you know, she makes me... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
SUE POWER But I don't think of any (inaudible ), she'd still finding something. 'Coz I think she's just... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS You usually do it at (inaudible ). 

00:11:42
SUE POWER Yeah, these things. 

00:11:42
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:11:42
SUE POWER I can't win with her at the moment, really. 

00:11:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. Does it cause arguments? 

00:11:45
SUE POWER  Oh, we do argue quite a lot. 

00:11:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
LINDA GASK It's becoming apparent that this woman's daughter sees the amount that she's drinking as a problem. The doctor goes on to explore this further and tries to find out what her views of the problems are as well as her daughter's. 

00:12:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS What do you do then when you've had that sort of round? 'Coz you must feel really churned up. 

00:12:10
SUE POWER Yeah, it can get, you know, I know. 

00:12:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
SUE POWER  Ah, that's because I have a drink. 

00:12:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:12:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Have you ever thought that you should cut down? 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:25
SUE POWER  Sometimes yes, sometimes I think this might be a bit too much. 

00:12:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
Picks up non-verbal cue 

00:12:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS It upsets you? 

00:12:40
SUE POWER Yeah, sorry. 

00:12:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS It's all right. Why is that? 

00:12:45
SUE POWER  Karen (inaudible ) I'm making it and it seemed like I'm doing something really awful. 

00:12:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
Empathic comment 

00:12:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS  And you are trying as hard as you possibly can to keep things smooth for her. 

00:13:05
SUE POWER Yeah. And most of the time I just think ah, well because I've got to relax. You know, I've got to have something. 

00:13:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:13:15
SUE POWER  And, and I feel all right but occasionally, I will feel bad. 

00:13:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
SUE POWER And I miss work or something. 

00:13:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Does that happen much? 

00:13:30
LINDA GASK A number of different alcohol-related problems emerge: missing work, financial worries in addition to family problems. The doctor then moved on to clarify the patient's problems and acknowledge the wider range of difficulties that she has in addition to alcohol which is clearly on his agenda at the moment but not on hers. He negotiates with her to discuss this further. 

00:13:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS  What do you think the other main problems are? 

00:13:55
SUE POWER  Well being tired. 

00:14:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhhmm. 

00:14:00
SUE POWER You know it's lack of energy really sometimes I think that it gets so muddled with Karen and, and everything else because I feel. 

00:14:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:14:10
SUE POWER  Yeah, and I feel quite on top form so that's, that's the problem. 

00:14:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Anything else? 

00:14:20
SUE POWER  Work can be quite. 

00:14:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
SUE POWER Yeah. I can't. I don't really get into the habit of just you know taking time off because, ah, doing that could be really... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
SUE POWER ...bad for us all. 

00:14:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Yes. 

00:14:40
SUE POWER The family. 

00:14:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Because you're the breadwinner? 

00:14:40
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah. I've got to work. I'm not just work maybe at sometimes 'coz it is, I've not a lot an awful of time off work. 

00:14:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
SUE POWER Some days it's that Jennifer really take me, to get out of bed and to go. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:14:55
SUE POWER You know nothing work so I just fall and said I'm not doing this today. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. Yes. 

00:15:00
SUE POWER  And then again that sets of things with Karen because you know she, really gets crossed(ph) and that 'coz she's said. 

00:15:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
SUE POWER  She just thinks I'm hangover(ph), I think. 

00:15:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. So this Karen to work and underneath it all... (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
SUE POWER And she. 

00:15:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS That you've shared(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:15:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS And with not having the energy to deal with it. 

00:15:25
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:15:25
Negotiation 

00:15:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS  How would you feel if I added. That the alcohol onto that list? 

00:15:35
SUE POWER And I thought you're lying. I'm not sure, I mean sometimes I feel, yeah, I should really not do this every night, not having, well does it really did me that much harm and, and I can get so wind up you know that ah, I don't know. Something I'd have to think about, not really I think. 

00:16:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Tell me if it's on the list then. Think about it. 

00:16:10
SUE POWER  Yeah. Okay. 

00:16:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Okay. 

00:16:15
SUE POWER I do that. 

00:16:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS I think it would useful for us to meet again until she start to talk around the problems. 

00:16:20
LINDA GASK  Now let's move on to the second stage of this model which is exploring the necessity for change. The woman's returned earlier than expected. 

00:16:35
SUE POWER  I just said awful to be with Karen the other night, that was uhm, God I can't. It was so stupid. You know, we would, we were actually having quite a nice night. 

00:16:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS You are. 

00:16:50
SUE POWER We got supper. David had been home for supper than he'd gone out and it was quite nice of him watching tele together and I thought yeah, you know, this is our hope for us and uhm, and then it was this, it was some remark of me about this program and tell me it was some stupid program, I can't even remember properly what was happening but I said something there are typical man and she went absolutely been honest about and accused me of trying to put off her men or something. It's just, this thing she at the moment that anything I say she takes something like all because very personal, you know.(crosstalk) 

00:17:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
SUE POWER  So you ended upon this, just a major rile, and I got angry and said things I didn't mean. She said things that she wouldn't tell me, if you know I'm, and basically had, I decided to have a few drinks and ah, I don't know if it's just 'coz so tired of what it was but I drank this bottle and uhm, I must have fallen asleep downstairs. 

00:18:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
SUE POWER And apparently she came down and tried wake me up but couldn't and ah, she said I passed out. I, I don't know what, I think I was just in a really deep sleep. 

00:18:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
SUE POWER And I work for the early hours, you know. I went to bed and then the next morning and she wouldn't speak to me except to say that she found me unconsciously. And that she was going to a dance straight from school and she won't be home that kind. And it, and I just felt so awful about it. 

00:18:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes, I'm sure. Yes. Has it happened before in that way? 

00:18:35
LINDA GASK They again go on to discuss the conflicts at home. Her daughter has said that her son is never at home because mother was always drunk. The doctor empathizes with how this awful statement must make her feel. 

00:18:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS It hurts when people throw out accusations at you, doesn't it? 

00:18:55
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:18:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS How did it make you feel? 

00:18:55
SUE POWER  Awful. 

00:19:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
SUE POWER Really awful. 

00:19:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
SUE POWER  But then I thought maybe it frightened them (inaudible ). 

00:19:12
DR. BARRY LEWIS True. 

00:19:12
SUE POWER And I felt awful about that as well. 

00:19:12
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. Does it frighten you? 

00:19:15
SUE POWER  It did a bit. I haven't done it before. 

00:19:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. How did you feel the next day? 

00:19:30
SUE POWER Lousy. 

00:19:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
SUE POWER  I got up, she didn't, I usually give her a lift to school but she didn't want me. She went off alone. 

00:19:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. How are you going to resolve things with Karen now? 

00:19:45
LINDA GASK It's clear that Karen is making alcohol the main issue. 

00:19:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Has it raised any other doubts in your mind? 

00:19:50
SUE POWER  I felt, I felt very guilty the next day. 

00:20:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
SUE POWER  Not because of the rile really because I didn't, I really didn't think that was all my fault. I've, I've probably said things I shouldn't have said, but you (inaudible ) but it, it all came out and (inaudible ) at me. 

00:20:17
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yeah. 

00:20:17
SUE POWER But I thought he had been out for me to just sit and didn't drink coffee. 

00:20:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS No. 

00:20:20
SUE POWER And I was, I kept thinking she might be really frightened. 

00:20:25
Empathises 

00:20:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS That was right. And it's left you feeling frightened as well? 

00:20:30
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah. I hope that's been good end for the top of it. 

00:20:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
Exploring the necessity for change Draw up a balance sheet of the pros and cons of the behaviour recognise difficulty of changing reinforce expressed wish for change resist giving reasons for change Summarise frequently 

00:20:35
LINDA GASK  A very useful strategy here is to get the person to draw her up a balance sheet of the pros and cons or the pluses and minuses of their behaviour. Sometimes you might even suggest that they write this down as an exercise. It's important to empathize with the difficulty in changing. Reinforce any statements which you express a desire to change. Above all resist to telling the person why they ought to change. A good intervention to try and help bring things together is to summarize frequently. Feedback in a fairly neutral way to the patient exactly what they're telling you. 

00:21:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS  You're using alcohol to relax? 

00:21:20
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah, It's, it's what I drink. 

00:21:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS It tastes nice? 

00:21:25
SUE POWER Yeah, I do like it, like the feeling. 

00:21:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. Sometimes it can be helpful, look at the pros and cons and just see up, up drinking and how, the alcohol that you're using and just see what the pros and cons of the alcohol are. What are the other advantages? What do you get from it? 

00:21:45
SUE POWER It has helped me to sleep. 

00:21:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:21:50
SUE POWER And there was a point not long after, you know, when I first divorced, you know, it takes me ages to go sleep and it's nice to feel... (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
SUE POWER So warmed up. 

00:22:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:22:00
SUE POWER And then, and you know, I couldn't relax or anything. So. 

00:22:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uhm. 

00:22:10
SUE POWER I just ah. 

00:22:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:22:10
SUE POWER I just want to escape, I suppose. 

00:22:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:22:10
SUE POWER  I feel like I can escape in sometimes. 

00:22:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS I'm sure, I'm sure. 

00:22:15
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:22:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. What else? Anything in the other side of the scales? 

00:22:20
SUE POWER  I just suppose it helped the situation with Karen. I, I'd, I don't, I don't think it's why she's like she's all I have around I don't suppose it helps because I get in stage where I, I suppose and I switch off from what was happening, you know, 'coz you see I have enough of this. And she gets of being in front of that. 

00:22:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:22:50
SUE POWER  You said that it could be making me, it could happen so making me feel tired. 

00:23:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS It's possible. Certainly. Yes. 

00:23:00
LINDA GASK  The doctor summarizes the pros and cons and then goes on to arrange some blood tests. 

00:23:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS  You've told me that you're enjoying it. And yet did this having a drink you've enjoyed having it? 

00:23:20
SUE POWER Yeah, I do. 

00:23:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS Does it helps you relax? 

00:23:20
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:23:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS  But also on the other side perhaps is one of the bones of contention between yourself and Karen. 

00:23:30
SUE POWER Yes. I haven't thought that she might see it this as me sort of distancing, was I? 

00:23:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yeah. And I was wondering whether as one of the reasons for your feeling tired, I guess the physical effect. 

00:23:45
SUE POWER  Yeah. I suppose it could be. 

00:23:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS  How would you feel if we just did a couple of blood test to check generally how you are, make sure you're not anemic? Check you. 

00:24:00
SUE POWER  Yeah, of course. 

00:24:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS Okay, 'coz again that will make sure that there's nothing else going on. 

00:24:10
SUE POWER All right, yeah. 

00:24:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS And, and perhaps help to ease some of that worry in the background because you're still feeling tired despite all what's going on. 

00:24:20
SUE POWER Yeah, I suppose it could be something about that. 

00:24:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Uh hmm. What you're going to do from here? 

00:24:30
SUE POWER I don't know at all. 

00:24:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
SUE POWER  I don't know what to do. 

00:24:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
SUE POWER I need to think, I need to. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS  What are you going to think about? 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:45
SUE POWER  I suppose I'm gonna think about what it's like if I haven't drink as much. 

00:24:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
SUE POWER  But I don't know if it would be that easy for me to just say out loud that I wouldn't drink anymore. 

00:25:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS No. 

00:25:05
Highlight contradictory statements 

00:25:05
LINDA GASK It isn't easy to change. People will tell you all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't. There isn't a problem anyway. They don't want to change. They don't have to change. It's too difficult. A useful strategy for promoting change at this point is to highlight the discussion the conflicting, ambivalent statements which the patient is telling you that really do not fit together. 

00:25:30
SUE POWER  You said I'm not actually sure that uhm, all right I'll stop drinking I, I, I don't drink anymore that was actually to make everything all right. Because Karen still is, all right. But I'm being so (inaudible ) about that I think. She's 16, you know, she's, she's going through all these changes and, and that most teenagers have bad patches with their parents. So by just removing, stopping me drinking I don't think that's gonna change anything you know. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
SUE POWER  'Coz I think it would be something else. 

00:26:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS I'm a bit confused by what you said, on the one hand you've said that you don't want to come down, you're not sure but that's the main problem, but just a little bit earlier you were saying that you were very upset by how much you drink, drank after the rile with Karen, that you felt lousy the day afterwards and also that you wondered what life was like before, before you were drinking as much. I don't think that matches together very well. 

00:26:35
SUE POWER I was upset, yeah. I do feel bad. 

00:26:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
SUE POWER But I'm not sure it would be that easy to ah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS  I don't think its easy. You can't go backwards; you can't be the person that you were before. From where you are now, what are the options? 

00:27:00
LINDA GASK  I spoke to Sue Power, who's playing the patient here to ask her, her views. 

00:27:10
SUE POWER Change isn't easy and can be a very painful process and I think it's very important to be aware of that. I think it's also important to be able to have people to, to look at the effects it's having on them and to, that sometimes we're so enmeshed in that that we, we missed, we can't see very obvious contradictions until we have someone help as look at those is, is a fairly good exercise. I think the other, the other thing that's important is to acknowledge how difficult change can be. So even when someone has admitted that yes it would be good to change this a lot about their lives but it's not necessarily going to be easy for them to do it, and, and to acknowledge that is important. 

00:28:00
LINDA GASK  At some point, you have to try and promote resolution of this conflict. 

00:28:05
Promoting resolution To enable 'informed decision' provide feedback about safety and risks of behavior results of examinations or tests potential medical, legal, or social consequences likely outcome of possible choices or interventions 

00:28:05
LINDA GASK  The first step is to provide feedback to enable the person or patient to make an informed decision. This isn't giving advice, but it's providing information. You can provide basic information about the safety or the risks of them continuing their behavior. If you're a doctor or a nurse, you can provide results of examinations that have been carried out or tests that have been done. You can provide information about the potential medical, legal, and social consequences and the likely outcome of potential choices and interventions. At the end this- 

00:28:45
Ask for feedback Give the person responsibility for decision If the person wishes to change, discuss plan in a person-centered manner If the person does not wish to change, or cannot arrive at a decision, negotiate whether, how, and when to review 

00:28:45
LINDA GASK - it is crucial to ask for feedback. You have to give the person himself the responsibility for the decision. If they do seek to change, negotiate plans in a person- centered manner. If they don't seek to change at this point, or they're unable to come to a decision, negotiate a clear plan for if, when, or how you're going to review things. In the next section of this consultation, let's watch how the doctor actually allows the patient to come back and ask questions and how he maintains this non-judgmental style. 

00:29:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS  I got your results from last week. 

00:29:25
SUE POWER All right. 

00:29:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. Do you want to see them? 

00:29:30
SUE POWER Yeah, oh, please (inaudible ) just tell them. 

00:29:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Well, I'll explain with pleasure, uhm- 

00:29:35
Provides feedback 

00:29:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS - They are slightly abnormal, not terribly. And you've got some larger red cells in your blood than you should have normally. And also, the test to see how your liver is working is slightly abnormal. And that combination shows a little bit of damage by alcohol. It's reversible. As I said it shows that the alcohol that you're having is having a physical effect as well. 

00:30:10
SUE POWER  And you're sure that it's alcohol that's causing that... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. 

00:30:15
SUE POWER There's no other reasons for it? 

00:30:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm, uhm, a combination, there's always alcohol, you surprised? 

00:30:25
SUE POWER Yeah, yeah. I mean I'm, then we talked about problems and things but I've never sort of thought of actually physically do much harm. 

00:30:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. 

00:30:35
SUE POWER  What sort of damage? You said damage to my liver. 

00:30:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS The damage to your liver shows that the cells of your liver are getting inflamed so alcohol apart from being nice, it is also poison. And ah, it can just inflame your liver. Do a little damage which is reversible certainly on the early stages. This doesn't show the cirrhosis of the liver or anything terrible going on. (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
SUE POWER  Right. 

00:31:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS But you are getting some inflammation of the liver due to the alcohol. Much the same with your blood test as well the issue of blood count and we can find that you've got larger than average cells, red blood cells, in your blood stream. If you're actually taking alcohol, it can get into the bone marrow and alter the way you're producing your cells. 

00:31:25
SUE POWER  You said it's reversible. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. 

00:31:30
SUE POWER So when you got, you can get me something to. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Okay, you need to stop poisoning it. 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:40
SUE POWER  All right. So I need to stop drinking you say? 

00:31:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS  You certainly need to stop exposing the liver and bloodstream to the amount of alcohol that you're exposing it to. 

00:31:55
SUE POWER  To cut down. 

00:32:00
Gives patient responsibility 

00:32:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS It's your choice, really. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:05
SUE POWER  Uhm, I mean, as it, as it is now is it actually, I mean it, it doesn't seem to have given me any problems, you know some maybe, would that get worse, you think? 

00:32:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS You say it's not given you problems? 

00:32:25
SUE POWER Well, physically I, I don't think that it's given me any problems, you know like you said my liver was inflamed... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm, uhm. 

00:32:35
SUE POWER ...but it's not, uhm, whatever it is it's not giving me any pain... (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Right. 

00:32:40
SUE POWER ...or do you know anything that like but would that get worse with that? 

00:32:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS  You're feeling tired? 

00:32:45
SUE POWER It's nothing to do with my liver then? 

00:32:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Not entirely, but it might be one factor in that. 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:32:50
SUE POWER  All right. You said that by cutting down I could, it would go all right again. 

00:33:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes, there's no irreversible damage there at all. 

00:33:10
SUE POWER That's good, I suppose. 

00:33:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Is there anything else you want- 

00:33:20
Asks for comments/questions 

00:33:20
DR. BARRY LEWIS - To know about the amount of alcohol you're having or anything else about it, the damage it can do. 

00:33:30
SUE POWER  Well, this, that would be having too much on (inaudible ). 

00:33:37
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. 

00:33:37
SUE POWER  I mean if I carry on would, would this just get worse. 

00:33:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS  Yes, yes. Potentially, you're just going to do more damage to the liver. And that's the, a bit that gets hurt most. 

00:33:50
SUE POWER  I don't know how it is, I'm sorry, I don't know much about it. 

00:34:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS No, it's all right. Eventually, you do permanent damage to the liver, so at this stage, this is inflammation. If you allow the inflammation to go on it gets scarring and then you get the permanent damage to the liver that is called cirrhosis of the liver. We need our livers to get rid of all the other poisons and chemicals in the blood stream. 

00:34:20
SUE POWER  Yeah. 

00:34:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS So if you damage it, then you're damaging a system that ah, you can't do without. 

00:34:30
SUE POWER Right. 

00:34:35
[sil.] 

00:34:35
SUE POWER  I don't have much choice really to. (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uhm. You seem very surprised? 

00:34:40
Acknowledges non-verbal cue 

00:34:40
SUE POWER  Yeah, I'm surprised. I mean I don't, I don't know that I've been having problems. 

00:34:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
SUE POWER  And that maybe something else have to do with, with what I'm drinking and I didn't actually think that, you know like anything like this. 

00:35:05
DR. BARRY LEWIS Last week, we talked about the scales, and the pros and cons... (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
SUE POWER Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
DR. BARRY LEWIS ...of alcohol. I think we've just added another one on one side of the scale. 

00:35:15
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:35:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS  What do you want to do from here? 

00:35:20
Negotiates plans 

00:35:20
SUE POWER  What do I want to do? 

00:35:25
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
[sil.] 

00:35:30
SUE POWER  I just want it not to be harm, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
DR. BARRY LEWIS Yes. 

00:35:35
SUE POWER Given that it is. Yeah, I want to be able to control my drinking and be able... (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
SUE POWER ...to cut down but, ah, if I might be able to stop I don't know. I don't think I can stop actually just like that. 

00:35:50
DR. BARRY LEWIS I know. It's hard to stop- 

00:35:55
Agrees change is difficult 

00:35:55
DR. BARRY LEWIS - It's hard to give up something which has become part of your life. 

00:36:00
SUE POWER Yeah. 

00:36:00
DR. BARRY LEWIS And that you enjoy it? 

00:36:00
SUE POWER  Yeah. I don't know if it's just about enjoyment. I don't think it helps me get, helps me get by. 

00:36:15
DR. BARRY LEWIS Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
LINDA GASK Let's now hear from Sue Power again. 

00:36:15
SUE POWER  I think an ability to, to listen and, and to take on that person's life from what such that's happening in their life not to look at alcohol in a, an isolated way but see it as a, as a, as a part of the whole and, and that requires a sensitivity. It's easy to make people feel guilty, to judge them. And I think it's very important not to do that. But, but to listen and to gather the information you're being given and then, I would say to tell the patient understand what's happening and, and, and why this happens. And because I guess that the, the most important thing is, is to find out whether the, the patient feels they have the problem and, and then to help them explore that. But then you have to do that before you can go well beyond that. Before you can actually help them deal with the problem, if they choose to deal with it. And maybe that's another quality they need the ability to, to let it go. If the patient says, its fine I can deal with it the way it is, then you have to be able to leave them. But it is important obviously, that that the patient can make a choice about that, an informed choice, so they also need to be asked if the patient clear information about the effects. This is having a little physical for instance, but I think most patients with help can work out the effects that's having on their lives. So I'm sure, giving up something, the loss of something in a patient's life will, will leave a hole and it's perhaps sense about helping patients find ways of dealing with that loss. 

00:38:10
LINDA GASK  Now, let's move on to the second patient. The next consultation you're going to see is essentially scene setting. This is the second time that this man has visited his doctor with abdominal pain. She gave him some medication at the end of the first consultation and he's coming back. She's going to go through what roughly incorporates the first stage of the model and you'll see a number of the skills demonstrated. After you've watched this, we're going to give you the opportunity to practice some of these skills and strategies incorporated in stages 2 and 3. 

00:38:50
DR. SALLY STANDART Oh, welcome back Mr. Herson. Uhm, how things, back couple of weeks since procedure, isn't it? 

00:38:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:55
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. 

00:38:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, I got left. My (inaudible ). 

00:39:00
DR. SALLY STANDART Really? 

00:39:00
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, It's still (inaudible ). 

00:39:01
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. So what's been happening in the last couple of weeks with it? 

00:39:05
CHRIS TUPMAN We'll it just, I just doesn't seem to, I mean like a, I suppose a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Uhm, uhm. 

00:39:05
CHRIS TUPMAN ...but it just doesn't seem to if I'm really going to heal. 

00:39:10
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. 

00:39:10
CHRIS TUPMAN You know cause I'm still getting an instant (inaudible ) going on there. And I've been looking at it but doesn't look bad. 

00:39:15
DR. SALLY STANDART Really, yeah, yeah, yeah. How, does it last for any length of time? 

00:39:20
CHRIS TUPMAN Uhm, it slightly goes on and off on full day... (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
DR. SALLY STANDART Uhm. Right. 

00:39:25
CHRIS TUPMAN ...but you know, in some days it's like it would just be there all the time, you know, just be like a bit (inaudible ) all the time. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. 

00:39:30
CHRIS TUPMAN Just like feeling you know.- 

00:39:30
Acknowledges non-verbal cue 

00:39:30
DR. SALLY STANDART  You look a bit uncomfortable over this, is it? 

00:39:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Well, we'd like, 'coz I thought that was the stuff you gave, gave me was going to sort of like... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. SALLY STANDART Right, yeah, yeah. 

00:39:40
CHRIS TUPMAN ...knock it off really but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.

LINDA GASK The doctor's have asked to remain neutral with respect to the problem behaviour. Just trying to raise the issue again sensitively and obtain clear information non-judgmentally and she's also drawn up a problem list- 

00:46:40
If the topic of problem behaviour is not already on the agenda raise it sensitively and obtain clear information non-judgmentally. Draw up the person's problem list with priorities. Discuss whether the person considers the behaviour to be a problem. 

00:46:40
LINDA GASK - and discussed whether the person himself considers the behaviour to be a problem. It's also clear that his wife probably hoped it was a problem. She's negotiated whether to discuss the behaviour any further.

CHRIS TUPMAN  But it's just like, I mean I wouldn't, you know, I'm just trying not sort of like I've (inaudible ) before, you know, if I'm getting up early in the morning. 

00:52:45
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. 

00:52:45
CHRIS TUPMAN I still feel. I mean, say (inaudible ) from something. 

00:52:50
DR. SALLY STANDART And you also said to me that (inaudible ) you feel a little bit rough in the mornings. 

00:52:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:52:55
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah, Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Sometimes I think that's what it makes it, you know, like if a(ph), like a couple of beings, I mean, like there was time also were like knocking about (inaudible ) of whiskeys and loads of, you know, loads of beer and so like drinking, you know, I'm still (inaudible ) and I would count ten and I just wanna get home like. (inaudible ), you know, the one thing that... 

00:53:10
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. So sort of on the plus- 

00:53:10
Summarises 

00:53:10
DR. SALLY STANDART - side in drinking. Does the, does, if you, it gives you pleasure. You're able to got and meet chums, no (inaudible ) get out of that awful bed set. 

00:53:22
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:53:22
DR. SALLY STANDART  And also that you said it actually helps you relax a bit. 

00:53:25
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:53:25
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. 'Coz after stressful day at work. 

00:53:25
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:53:25
DR. SALLY STANDART  Uh hmm, but on, on the minus side we've also talked about money. 'Coz it's been a bit of (inaudible ) with your wife. 

00:53:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:53:35
DR. SALLY STANDART And then how you feel sometimes in the mornings? 

00:53:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:53:35
DR. SALLY STANDART But we're not too sure about that. 

00:53:40
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:53:40
DR. SALLY STANDART And also that you're a little bit worried about how, uhm, it might be affecting your job. 

00:53:45
LINDA GASK This man is giving me quite a lot of conflicting information. If you're playing the doctor here how would you actually go about highlighting for him the statements that he's giving you that really don't fit together? 

00:53:55
DR. SALLY STANDART  Are you so worried about your drinking as you were a couple of weeks ago? 

00:54:00
CHRIS TUPMAN (Coughing) 

00:54:00
DR. SALLY STANDART  'Coz you are, you are quite frigthen than I thought. 

00:54:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Well, that's the way it's affecting me. 

00:54:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
CHRIS TUPMAN (inaudible ) what that was like. 

00:54:10
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
CHRIS TUPMAN (inaudible ) than that. Well that's (inaudible ), I can't seem to like. 

00:54:15
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. 

00:54:15
CHRIS TUPMAN Sometime. I mean I don't think, I don't think that drinking that much (inaudible ). 

00:54:22
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:25
LINDA GASK  Now, let's look at what actually happened. 

00:54:30
DR. SALLY STANDART  I'm a bit puzzled because on the one hand, you're saying to me that you know obviously drink is good. And you're enjoying it. 

00:54:40
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:40
DR. SALLY STANDART But on the other hand, you're also telling me... (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
CHRIS TUPMAN (coughing) 

00:54:40
DR. SALLY STANDART ...that's been causing you a fair bit of problems. 

00:54:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:54:45
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. I'm not quite sure how, you can get out of that one. Can, any idea that can help me with on that one if we sort of weigh out both... (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:54:55
DR. SALLY STANDART ...pluses and the minuses. 

00:54:55
CHRIS TUPMAN  Let me ask. I mean, I suppose that's what, I suppose that's what (inaudible ) my wife (inaudible ) out like. 

00:55:11
DR. SALLY STANDART All right. So that's, that's another minus. 

00:55:15
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:55:15
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. Is that one? 

00:55:15
CHRIS TUPMAN  I suppose I mean, yeah. 

00:55:20
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
CHRIS TUPMAN2 I mean, that one, I mean I think that was a bit there and (inaudible ). 

00:55:26
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm, uh hmm, too, right. yeah. 

00:55:26
CHRIS TUPMAN I'm not saying like she asked me now, they say I feel bad (inaudible ). 

00:55:32
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. 

00:55:32
CHRIS TUPMAN I mean, I know that was. (inaudible ) And that wasn't pretty. I mean (inaudible ) there I mean. 

00:55:38
DR. SALLY STANDART Well, so, so that's a lot of minuses it's that (inaudible ) if it, if you know, it, might things gotten a bit worse I suppose. 

00:55:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Well, I think it wouldn't (inaudible ). 

00:55:50
DR. SALLY STANDART Right, yeah, that, that was, that was enough. Yeah, yeah. 

00:55:50
CHRIS TUPMAN I mean that was a bit like (inaudible ) and I think... 

00:55:55
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah, Uh hmm. So what we've got sort of two slice of a, sort of like a balance sheet. 

00:56:00
CHRIS TUPMAN Hmm. Yeah. 

00:56:00
LINDA GASK  Now, if you're playing the doctor, I'd like you to watch this part of the consultation and think about how you could give this man some feedback. I'll give you some clues. He's drinking around 40 to 50 units of alcohol a week. His blood tests are negative at the moment, but there is of course, the potential problem that his physical problems could get worse. He also, is at risk of losing his license if he's caught drinking and driving. 

00:56:30
CHRIS TUPMAN You know, what else is there except going and see your mates. You know, maybe movie over mates. Drinking, I mean, I can't, you know, I can't drink that way (inaudible ). 

00:56:46
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. Yeah. Yes, I can see that this- 

00:56:46
Agrees change is difficult 

00:56:46
DR. SALLY STANDART - you're in a difficult situation now. 

00:56:50
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:56:50
DR. SALLY STANDART And I could see that if you didn't want to cut down, it would actually cause some anxieties for you. 

00:56:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:56:55
DR. SALLY STANDART Would I be right then? 

00:56:55
CHRIS TUPMAN  (inaudible ) It's like saying I can't, I can't think of what else to do. (crosstalk) 

00:57:02
DR. SALLY STANDART You can't see what else to do. 

00:57:05
CHRIS TUPMAN You know, I mean, like, I know if a guy out, we're gonna drink. 

00:57:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. Yeah. 

00:57:10
[sil.] 

00:57:10
LINDA GASK  Now, let's look at what actually happened in this consultation. 

00:57:15
DR. SALLY STANDART I'd like to maybe give you some of the medical facts and figures about how much drinking. 

00:57:25
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:57:25
DR. SALLY STANDART 'Coz I think that might actually give us a bit more information that you can base your decision on. 

00:57:30
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:57:30
DR. SALLY STANDART Uhm, we're sort of been talking about how much you're drinking. We did that last time, last time and today. And I've sort of worked out, its about, you're drinking between about 40, 50 units a week. 

00:57:40
CHRIS TUPMAN Is that a lot then? 

00:57:40
DR. SALLY STANDART That is quite a lot. What we call a safe limit for a man... (crosstalk) 

00:57:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:57:45
DR. SALLY STANDART ...is 21 units. 

00:57:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:57:45
DR. SALLY STANDART So you're really over, over double. 

00:57:50
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:57:50
DR. SALLY STANDART Now that causes, could cause you some problems. 

00:57:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:57:55
DR. SALLY STANDART And I could see for you the big area that it would cause problems would be in driving. 

00:58:00
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:58:00
DR. SALLY STANDART Because the more you drink, the more likely you are to have an accident. 

00:58:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah, well, yeah, I mean a little just like you said to me. 

00:58:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. Yeah. Uhmm, and then, of course, if you got into, uhm, trouble. 

00:58:10
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:58:10
DR. SALLY STANDART I mean, what would your, what would your private life (inaudible ) 

00:58:18
CHRIS TUPMAN  Pretty, it's pretty much (inaudible ), I mean, so, then I'm really bothered by it (inaudible ). I'm really bothered by (inaudible ) You know what that like is. 

00:58:27
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. 

00:58:27
CHRIS TUPMAN  But I don't wanna lose my license. 

00:58:30
DR. SALLY STANDART Right. Yeah. I mean, that would make major issues then. 

00:58:30
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:58:30
DR. SALLY STANDART I mean, that's sort of, that would've, might affect, some of it might affect your job if you were drinking... (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:58:35
DR. SALLY STANDART At this level, if you continue doing it at this level for any length of time. The other thing is, of course, is, what's happening to your body with the amount your drinking. 

00:58:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:58:45
DR. SALLY STANDART I think you got a couple of blood tests when I first saw you. And they're okay at the moment, which is very reassuring, the fact that it hasn't damage you in any way so far. 

00:58:50
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

00:58:50
DR. SALLY STANDART  But it's obviously affecting your stomach quite badly. The tablets... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
CHRIS TUPMAN These tablets are. 

00:59:00
DR. SALLY STANDART ...they're helping certainly at the moment, but the fact is in a sense we're sort of giving, you're having alcohol and then we have some sort of conflict with drugs.(crosstalk) 

00:59:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:59:05
DR. SALLY STANDART If we could have a little bit less of alcohol, we might need the drugs. 

00:59:05
CHRIS TUPMAN  Right, right. 

00:59:10
DR. SALLY STANDART And then sometimes, people may develop ulcers. 

00:59:10
CHRIS TUPMAN  Hmm. 

00:59:15
DR. SALLY STANDART You know? If you continue like this for long, and then maybe other health problems for you. So, there's quite a lot of things that I could see as potential problems in the future for you... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

00:59:25
DR. SALLY STANDART ...with drinking. 

00:59:25
CHRIS TUPMAN  Same as smoking or any other stuff. 

00:59:30
DR. SALLY STANDART It's, it's very similar issues in some ways, you know. But at the moment, drinking sounds as if it's more the cause of your immediate problems... (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
CHRIS TUPMAN Yes, yeah. 

00:59:40
DR. SALLY STANDART ...than, than, than smoking, you know. 

00:59:40
LINDA GASK  Now, we're into the stage of promoting resolution. I'd like you to watch this part of the discussion- 

00:59:50
Ask for feedback Give the person responsibility for decision If the person wishes to change, discuss plan in a person-centred manner If the person does not wish to change, or cannot arrive at a decision, negotiate whether, how, and when to review 

00:59:50
LINDA GASK - and then, think about how you might improve in it. What do you think about what the doctor does in this interview? Do you think it's likely to be effective? Watch the interview, and then you'll see a discussion point caption at which point I'd like you to stop the tape and discuss what you've seen. 

01:00:10
DR. SALLY STANDART With all that we've talked about, how would you feel about, maybe thinking about starting to cut down a little bit? And what I've told you about the risks for you. 

01:00:25
CHRIS TUPMAN  I mean if, I suppose I should like, you know. 

01:00:30
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. 

01:00:30
CHRIS TUPMAN  It's like to say, you know what I mean, It's having to, you know, what to do. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. 

01:00:35
CHRIS TUPMAN You mean like, I'm not gonna sit in a bed, sit looking at the four walls, you know what I mean? 

01:00:40
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. Uh hmm. I'm not saying that we have to stop, but maybe just drink a bit less. 

01:00:50
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:00:50
DR. SALLY STANDART It's not sort of either or. 

01:00:50
CHRIS TUPMAN All right. 

01:00:50
DR. SALLY STANDART You could maybe think that there might be something to drinking a bit less for you. How would that sound? 

01:00:55
CHRIS TUPMAN  I mean, I mean, I suppose I hope you don't go over the top like, you know. 

01:01:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Hmm. Yeah. 

01:01:05
CHRIS TUPMAN  Well (inaudible ) It's like, it's like you go out though okay, you go out like, I'll have a couple of pints. I'll start feeling relaxed. 

01:01:20
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. 

01:01:20
CHRIS TUPMAN You know, I'll have another one, I'll have a couple of another one, you know. 

01:01:20
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. 

01:01:20
CHRIS TUPMAN  You know, you're, you're just getting two, if you're not really. I can't drink that way. Well, I suppose, you know, I suppose I could. 

01:01:30
DR. SALLY STANDART Well, you can maybe think of things. If you, if you decide that it might be the advantages of cutting down. (crosstalk) 

01:01:40
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:01:40
DR. SALLY STANDART It's about ways, the disadvantages of cutting down. If you decide that, I can, so we can talk of practical things we can do together. 

01:01:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

01:01:45
DR. SALLY STANDART To actually help you at those sort of worrying times when you're thinking, I'm going back to (inaudible ). What should I do then? 

01:01:52
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. So these things you can do like, if you, you know. 

01:01:55
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. There are things we can do, I mean, like maybe, you know, as you say, making a pint last a bit longer or, uhm, drinking at the right (inaudible ) slowest member of the group, and lots of things we can try. 

01:02:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:02:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Not to, sort of, stop. 

01:02:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

01:02:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Not, 'coz, you know, we obviously want you to have times when you go out and relax and enjoy yourself. 

01:02:10
CHRIS TUPMAN Yes, yes. 

01:02:10
DR. SALLY STANDART Because alcohol's a great deal of fun... (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:02:15
DR. SALLY STANDART ...in moderation. 

01:02:15
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:02:15
DR. SALLY STANDART Uhm, so it might be useful to actually cut down a bit, but I really want you to go and think about that... (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
CHRIS TUPMAN Hmm. 

01:02:20
DR. SALLY STANDART ...and then come back and then we can, maybe, I don't know, few days a week, uhm, and if, and if you come back and you want something done right, then we can actually think about doing some practical things to help you, with some of, with some of these things that you looked at. 

01:02:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

01:02:35
DR. SALLY STANDART How does that sound? 

01:02:35
CHRIS TUPMAN  I mean, if you got ways of doing it, I suppose. 

01:02:40
Discussion Point 

01:02:40
LINDA GASK  I personally felt that that was a rather doctor-centered interview, but its the sort of interview that a lot of us have because we're used to giving advice. The problem is, that direct advice isn't always very effective. I'd like you to have a go yourself that carrying out this part of the consultation with one of you playing the doctor and one of you playing the patient as before, and see if you can improve on the consultation, and make it more patient-centered. 

01:03:20
[sil.] 

01:03:20
LINDA GASK  Now, let's look at how we thought this consultation might have been improved upon. 

01:03:30
DR. SALLY STANDART From what I've just told you, I think there might be some benefits in your cutting down in how much you're drinking. 

01:03:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

01:03:35
DR. SALLY STANDART  I think (inaudible ) sort of reasons why you have to stop at the moment. 

01:03:41
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:03:41
DR. SALLY STANDART  But I'd like, I mean, I told you a lot. I'd like you to tell me what- 

01:03:50
Asks for feedback 

01:03:50
DR. SALLY STANDART - what do you think about all that we talked about this morning? 

01:03:50
CHRIS TUPMAN  I mean, I suppose, I mean it's, I can see it's a lot for you. 

01:04:00
DR. SALLY STANDART  Hmm. 

01:04:05
CHRIS TUPMAN I mean, I can't make you drink as much. 

01:04:05
DR. SALLY STANDART Hmm. 

01:04:05
CHRIS TUPMAN  And in a way, better for me, if you know what I mean. 

01:04:10
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. 

01:04:10
CHRIS TUPMAN  Well, you know, it's like sometimes I just think like what else is, what else to do, you know. 

01:04:20
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. Right. 

01:04:20
CHRIS TUPMAN  I can't, it's like, just can't think of what else to do, really. 

01:04:30
DR. SALLY STANDART Uh hmm. 

01:04:30
CHRIS TUPMAN I mean, that, you know, if I go out... (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
DR. SALLY STANDART  Hmm. 

01:04:35
CHRIS TUPMAN ...what am I gonna do, you know. I mean, well, I'm not gonna say I don't know. 

01:04:35
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. Hmm. 

01:04:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Looking at the four walls, you know, or watching telly. 

01:04:40
DR. SALLY STANDART Sure. 

01:04:40
CHRIS TUPMAN I've never liked (inaudible ). 

01:04:45
DR. SALLY STANDART Well, I'm not saying that we'd have to get you to stop drinking. 

01:04:45
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:04:45
DR. SALLY STANDART It's just maybe to drink a little bit less and there's some very practical things that we can do about that. We can think of things to, to do. 

01:04:55
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:04:55
DR. SALLY STANDART And when you go out drinking, so that you can actually go out and enjoy the things that you always enjoyed. 

01:05:00
CHRIS TUPMAN  Right. 

01:05:05
DR. SALLY STANDART And maybe cut down a bit of some of the negative things about drinking. 

01:05:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:05:05
DR. SALLY STANDART How would that sound if we were to go down that line? 

01:05:10
CHRIS TUPMAN Well, you mean, it's like you could tell me what things that I could do that way. 

01:05:20
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah, I mean things like that. 

01:05:20
CHRIS TUPMAN 'Coz I'm not interested in, like, you know, doing something I can take (inaudible ) I'm not gonna do that. 

01:05:25
DR. SALLY STANDART No, no, no. It's obviously, I mean the pub and your mates that are, they're, they're a part of your life and we don't want to take that away. 

01:05:30
CHRIS TUPMAN When you say it like that, I could, I could still go out and drink. 

01:05:35
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah. 

01:05:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Drink less. 

01:05:35
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah, yeah. 

01:05:35
CHRIS TUPMAN Well, I mean (inaudible ) I'll go out, I'll sit down. I'll have a couple of pints now and just keep drinking. You're saying this way, the way. 

01:05:40
DR. SALLY STANDART  Yeah, but I suppose what I would like you to think about is whether you like to try that- 

01:05:50
Gives patient responsibility 

01:05:50
DR. SALLY STANDART - as an idea. I think it has to be your decision. 

01:05:50
CHRIS TUPMAN  Well, I could do anything for that. (inaudible ). 

01:05:59
DR. SALLY STANDART Sure, I, maybe, yeah, if I, I can't force you to do it. But I like maybe, I suppose, would like to do is to set, I can think of some quite good ideas that have worked with other people... (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
CHRIS TUPMAN Yeah. 

01:06:05
DR. SALLY STANDART ...that might help you. 

01:06:05
CHRIS TUPMAN (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
DR. SALLY STANDART Yeah, yeah. And they work. 

01:06:10
CHRIS TUPMAN Right. 

01:06:10
DR. SALLY STANDART But I would also say that I'd like you to think about if you think that that's worth it for you at the moment. 

01:06:15
LINDA GASK  Let's hear it from Chris, who is playing the patient there. 

01:06:20
CHRIS TUPMAN  And the good thing was, she didn't say like, you know, "If you get carried drinking, this is gonna be...", she didn't say it like that. It wasn't like it. It was directed to her saying, you know, you got to change or this is gonna happen. She just sort of laid out the facts, really, which, which is good 'coz it meant that she was saying, saying to me like "Here are the facts, what are you gonna do with them?" She wasn't saying like like, you'd expect, you know, this is about you, you got to cut it out. She was saying "These are the facts about what might happen, what do you think about that?" which I think, it's much more, it's much more saying to me that like, we need to talk and it's your problem-solving. 

01:06:55
LINDA GASK  So, you now have a chance to practice some of the specific micro skills of stages two and three of this model. The best thing to do now is to go away and record one of your real interviews, either on audio tape or video tape and play them back, preferably, with a group, so that you have an opportunity to see what you actually do in interviews and try and think where you might use some of these skills and strategies to improve on things.
