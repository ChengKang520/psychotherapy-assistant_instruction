STUART (ph) It is now my privilege and honor, ah, as 2010 NARACES president, to introduce to you our Sunday, ah Sunday, our Saturday (inaudible ) keynote and tell you a little bit about her. Um, I was so excited, because I had a two people that I wanted to keynote for NARACES and my two first choices both accepted. We’re so honor to have this particular person who started her career, ah, where I currently, I’m in the city university of New York at Brooklyn College as a counselor educator, moved on to the University of Maryland College Park and is currently professor in share, other counselor education program at Johns Hopkins University. In her last year’s career as a school counselor educator, she has a voluminous publications, presentations around consulting practice and has written the definitive book on Social Justice in school counseling ah…ah, closing achievement gaps, ah, which was published in 2007 Ivan Corwin Press. Her other research foci includes school community family partnerships and equity issues in school counseling and I am so excited that she was able to take the train is taking right back. Our eco-friendly, keynote speaker, Dr. Cheryl Holcomb-McCoy 

00:01:50
CHERYL HOLCOMB MCCOY It’s real…it’s real pleasure to be here at NARACES , because I know this is a great crowd of colleagues, um and I feel very much at home, um as Stuart mentioned, I started my very first regional ACES meeting was at NARACES. Um, when I worked at Brooklyn College, I remember coming to NARACES and at that time, I was very-very green and very naive counselor educator and I thought that I was gonna change the world in one year and that I could do all these wonderful things and I remember coming to NARACES and feeling like I don’t know if I can do everything in a year, but I…I’ll give it a shot and everyone was so encouraging, um and it was a welcoming group then and I’m happy to see that it still is, so I applaud all of you for maintaining such a wonderful…wonderful conference in a region and maybe you can take (inaudible ) in one day, I don’t know, I don’t know. 

00:02:42
(inaudible )) um…if you want to (inaudible )). 

00:02:46
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY I also…I also want to thank personally thank and publicly thank, Stuart and his wonderful team of dedicated members, um…they’re planned, what I think is a truly um, not only organized conference, but a timely and relevant conference for us as counselor educators. So, I just wanted to publicly thank you, Stuart and your entire team for such a great…great conference. 

00:03:10
School Counselors Closing Achievement and College Access Gaps A Framework for Counselor Educators and Supervisors Cheryl Holcomb-McCoy, Ph.D. Johns Hopkins University 

00:03:10
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY I've come here today and I know, we’re in the ah, we’re dealing with time issues and I don’t want to go over the time that I’ve been allotted, but I’ve come here today to talk about the need for what I call a seed(ph) change in the training of school counselors. For years, as counselor educators, we’ve provided high quality preparation programs for aspiring counselors. And in the last decade or so, may be a little bit more than a decade, many school counselor education programs have modified their programs or initiated what I called new, more rigorous practice and performance based programs to ensure that the CACREP ASCA standards and school counselor competencies are met. But more importantly, our school counselor educator programs have also tried to prepare, attempted to prepare, our school counselor graduates to work in the realities of our countries diverse school communities. So, I come here optimistic today that despite the obstacles that we had…an in our educational reform, movement and with…with all the talk around educational reforms that the seed, seeds(ph) have changed, have been planted in counselor education. But nevertheless, the US still faces some of the greatest educational challenges ever and that makes revisiting counselor preparation programs particularly school counselor educate.. education programs, it makes it all the more necessary and urgent. First as many of you know nearly 30% of US students today drop out or failed to complete high school on time. That’s about 1.2 million kids a year. Barely 60% of African-American, and Latino> students graduate on time and in many cit…cities and urban centers have or more…more of low income teens drop out of school. In addition, there is shortage of students who had the Math and Science skills for a future workforce and the achievement gaps between low income students and affluent students, students of color and white and Asian students had been well documented and still persist. So, our country in general is lagging behind other major countries in Math and Science. And I want to share with a cartoon right here just because I’ve, although can you see it. I find this cartoon funny, but is also sad. But this is where we are in education today and many people as does Arne Duncan who is the secretary of education. Believe that education is the civil rights issues of our generation and I believe that. And if we care about providing opportunity in reducing inequality if we really…really care about promoting civic knowledge and participation, schools are the best place to start and I think that’s school counselors are the best people to start it. Children in our needy schools, however, are least likely to have the school counselor accessible to them. There are the least likely to have the school counselor accessible to them and that is why effective school counseling to me is not just about counseling, it is a daily fight for social justice. So, based on these statistics, I want to just take a look at this picture. 

00:06:55
How will I help him decide what to do after high school? 

00:06:55
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY And you know this is not my Son, I did found such a little boy, no but he does look a lot like (inaudible ). But the question that I’ve for you today based on all of these statistics that I just quoted, our school counselors must ponder over some really serious questions and challenges. Take for instance, this question that I have here “How do we help this little baby boy have the options for his future?” Our school counselors assist him see a broader world of career and a post secondary options. Or take this picture. What do these young girls need from school counselors in order to be the scientist that they want to be? 

00:07:35
What will these girls need in order to become scientists? How do we help end poverty? 

00:07:35
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY What are we doing about gender inequity in Science and Math, what are we doing about racial inequities in Science and Math careers. And better yet, the age old question, what are we doing about poverty? How can we lessen poverty in our communities? How we preparing school counselors to work in schools in this nei… kind of neighborhood? What special skills and knowledge do our school counseling students need to have to be successful and effective in this neighborhood. For us, these questions are critical and our ability to attract counseling program applicants with the great passion, but the great passion for this kind of work for doing this type of work on a daily basis over the next 5 to 10 years will shape our profession for the next 30 years. So, let me say that again, the type of program applicants with great passion to do this kind of work, will shape our profession for the next 30 plus years, which I believe is important to our viability as a profession. So, my belief is that we must use what I called the EACH child philosophy and I forgot the child, I’m just dealing with the each. Our focus in training school counselors is to help our graduates. 

00:08:55
All of These Decisions Driven by… Equitable Opportunities Access to Caring Adults High Expectations 

00:09:00
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY Our graduate students really learn that our client or students at schools, in particularly low income students and students of color, they make life decisions based on equitable opportunities, that’s the E, access to those opportunities, that’s the A, caring adults that’s the C, and our high expectations for them, that’s the each philosophy. My husband and I are raising two small children with the same philosophy and we remind ourselves with this everyday. We want them to be aware of equitable opportunities, well at the same time, we as their parents are working hard every day to ensure that they have access to those opportunities. We’re also very mindful of their school environment and we want them to be exposed to caring people everyday and we as their parents and we expect for their teachers to have high expectations for them. I believe that this is the formula and the research informs this formula…that each…the each philosophy works and is key to children’s success. Horace Mann claimed years ago that “Education, then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is a great equalizer of conditions of men. It's the balance wheel of the social machinery. 

00:10:20
Education has been cited as the “Great Equalizer”…..Going to College is perceived as a means to upward social and income mobility Percentage of Individuals Age 25 and Older Living in Households in Poverty, by Household Type and Education level, 2005 The pathway to college caries based on disparities in students’ college preparation, college readiness, and the college culture within high schools. 

00:10:20
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY So if we think about education as the great equalizer, college access, and college attendance is the means to upward social and income mobility. For many of our K12 students. As the college board shows us in that you probably can’t see this table, but it’s a pretty um, popular table that shown, that was developed by the college board and what it show is that something that we already know the individuals living in poverty are less educated and vice-versa. College graduates make more money, they’re healthier, and they live longer. Significantly more than high school graduates or person that drop out of school. So, our goal for our students should be that they attend college because we know that education again is a great equalizer. It can improve the lives of our students. However, the pathway to college varies based on disparities in students’ college preparation, their college readiness, and their college, the college cultures of their high schools and for the sake of this, the rest of this presentation when I would say college what I defined it as any post secondary educational opportunity. So, it includes four-year colleges and two-year community colleges. School counselors though within this context of college access are very critical. 

00:11:45
School Counseling. There is no other professional more important to improving college access and college culture than school counselors. Barriers However, school counselors are often structurally constrained from doing college counseling and counselors in urban schools are even more unavailable because of high counselor-to-student ratios. Nationally, public high schools average2.6 school counselors per school. And, high poverty schools have an average of 1.3 full and part time counselors per school (U.S. Dept. of Education 2004) High Poverty/High Minority Schools. In high poverty and high minority schools, students are significantly less likely to have counselors and most likely to have counselors pulled away from college counseling to do non-counseling and/or school tasks. (Paul, 2002) EDUCATIONAL REFORM 

00:11:45
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY I know that there is no other professional in the schools or in education in general that is is important as school counselors are to improving college access. We are the key, however, there are many, many barriers for us as school counselors, structurally I call them structural problems. Counselors in urban schools are very unavailable to students than with the high counselor-to-student ratio and nationally public high schools average about 2.6 school counselors per school and in high poverty schools, there is an average of 1.3 full and part time counselors in a school that’s national shame(ph) as far as I’m concerned. Also, in high poverty and high minority schools, students are significantly less likely to have counselors and/or most likely to have counselors that are pulled away from college counseling to do non-counseling related tasks and many times administrative type tasks. So, we’re in this form of educational reform and as we talk about the…the structural constraints of school counselors, the need for school counselors, there is this movement going on, um and which we’re talking a lot about educational reform and I just want to update you on some of these movements, so we can see how we really fit as school counselors. There is…how many of you are familiar with Race To The Top. Oh good. Everyone is heard of it. 

00:13:20
Race To The Top 4.35 billion competitive fund grant to encourage and reward states making dramatic education reforms, especially in the four statutory “assurance areas” • Standards and assessments that prepare students for success • Data systems to support instruction • Great teachers and leaders • Turning around Struggling schools Goals are to find ambitious strategies and reforms from states to: • Drive substantial gains in student achievement •Improve graduation rates and college success •Close the achievement gap A Blueprint for Reform: Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Four Themes • College and Career Ready Students • Great Teachers and Leaders • Raise the Bar and Reward Excellence • Equity and Opportunity 

00:13:20
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY It’s you should have, there is 4.35 billion dollar competitive grant to encourage and reward states making…to…to make dramatic educational reforms, especially of four areas, standards and assessments, data systems, developing great teachers and administrators, and ability to turn around struggling schools. School counseling is not mentioned in most of the state, ah most of the race to the top grants, but look at these goals. The goals of the race to the top are to drive substantial gains in student achievement and to improve graduation rates and college success and to close the achievement gap Who better to improve graduation rates in college success than for school counselors. Another reforming initiative is the president's blueprint for reform. This is reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act and for us, college and career readiness for students is critical, so there we are. We are right there in there. Who is better equipped to talk about college readiness and to do college readiness work than school counselors, but we’re not mentioned. 

00:14:30
Promise Neighborhood One-year grants to provide cradle-to-career services that improve the educational achievement and healthy development of children. Educate to Innovate Through “Educate to Innovate,” the following goals will be achieved: Increase STEM literacy so that all students can learn deeply and think critically in science, math, engineering, and technology. Move American students from the middle of the pack to top in the next decade. Expand STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented groups, including women and girls. Waiting for Superman 2010 (opened Friday) movie depicting the crisis in today’s American education system. College and career-readiness is highlighted. Newark NJ Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, has pledged $ 100 million dollars to Newark NJ schools for school/educational reform efforts 

00:14:30
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY The promise neighborhood is another national initiative. Arne Duncan is the secretary of education again, recently awarded one year grants to communities and schools for providing cradle-to-career services that improved the educational achievement and healthy development of children and impoverish communities. Once again, career services is an area that counselors, that mental health and school counselors can be vital or key, but there is very little talk about counselors being involved and promise neighborhood. We are the education to innovate initiatives, is another recently announced reform initiative that focuses on increasing students in STEM readiness, the science, technology, engineering and math initiatives. Who better to advise students about STEM careers than school counselors, particularly when we discussing gender and racial inequities amongst STEM gradates and workers, who better, but we’re not their. We also we talked to dean today just mentioned, the waiting to superman movie and I’m hoping I can go and see it. It opened just yesterday in many cities and it’s really causing a stir among educational activist and community members, but the movie at all I don’t have it seen yet, but I doubt if it mentions school counselors. I hope it does, but we should be heavily involved in the dialogues about the needs of students and the problems with public education. Counseling in my opinion is an integral part of the schooling process and that should be acknowledged in every venue of educational reform and finally, I had some time yesterday. I actually watched Opera, I can’t believe that I had some times too, I can’t believe it and yesterday on Opera, it was announce that the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, how many of you knew about this? Good, he is giving a $100 million dollars to Newark NJ, where is Newark in the house, are you here, anybody from Newark, oh right…down the street. I really hope, the school counselors in Newark will apply for some of the challenge grants that are gonna come out of this money. We need to be a part. School counselors need to be a part of Newark’s educational transformation. It is an experiment to see if it works and we need to be a part of it. 

00:16:45
WHERE DO SCHOOL COUNSELORS FIT IN THIS EDUCATIONAL REFORM MOVEMENT? Critique of School Counselors Public Agenda Gates Foundation Study • 600 young adults participated • Results suggests that guidance systems/school counseling is “week” part of the nation’s efforts to increase college-going rates • Participants had harsh criticisms of school counselors 

00:16:50
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY So where do counselors fit in all of these, not…we’re not fitting in at all. There is not as much as I would like to see us fit in some of these national initiatives and some say we don’t fit and at all and say that we’re part of the problem. For instance, the public agenda, it was a public agenda report about the Gates Foundation. Public Agenda is actually part of the Gates Foundation. And they claimed that guidance systems are weak and are the bearers to the increase of college going. I received an e-mail about that and I was just live it, I’m looking at, I was just live it that we didn’t have a say in that report but research that I just completed for the college board, which was three-year longitudinal study, in which I went into five urban high schools though calls me to pause and reflect though, although I was live it about the public agenda report, I sat back and I reflected after I got over my anger and I thought about the results that I’d just gathered. For our study I’m gonna tell you a little bit about the study and if you’re interested in knowing more, the college board will be coming out with the results, but if you like to talk to me more about, I encourage you to contact me and I’ll share the entire….entire report. It’s pretty long, but I want you to just, I’m just gonna go over some of the highlights that caused me to really pause and reflect on what are we really doing. For our study, we used four theories or frameworks to guard our examination of urban counseling services and five urban schools, which we considered to be high poverty or high minority schools and some of the schools were both. 

00:18:25
College Board Study Framework Social Capital College Choice College Aspirations High School College-Going Culture instrumentation The Instruments and interview guide were developed in collaboration with the National Office of School Counselor Advocacy (NOSCA) staff. The College Preparation Questionnaire-Student Version • 82 Likert-Style and Dichotomous Items (Year 1) • 94 Likert-Style and Dichotomous Items (Year 2) The college Preparation Questionnaire-Counselor Version • 120 Likert-Style and Dichotomous Items (Year 1 and 2) Administrator/Department Chairperson Interview Guide. Procedural Overview • Data were collected from 5 urban, high poverty/high minority schools over two years October and November of 2007 and 2008 • Student and Counselor questionnaires along with scan sheets were distributed to participating schools • Student questionnaires are modified for the second year. • Administrator and department chairperson interviews were conducted both years. Sample Year I Total Sample •Students: 2,282 •Counselor: 22 •Schools: 5 Year II Total sample •Students: 1,497 •Counselor: 12 •Schools: 3 

00:18:25
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY And we use social capital theory, college choice as a framework, college aspirations, and high school college-going culture. So, we tried to measure each of those areas and see what we could get and give us a better view of what’s going on as far as the big school counseling services in those schools. We use that we developed our own instruments and interview guides and we had, we also had um, we actually developed an interview guide for the administrator and department chairperson and out of that came some really rich data about how administrator see counselors, schools counselors as well as the challenges of the partner chairs. The data was collected over two to three years, really over two years, because the first year was a planning time for us in building relationships with the schools and this was done in 2007 and 2008. We collected data from the students as well as the counselors, and then the administrators and the department chairs. Just to give you a sense of the numbers, the total sample in the first year was 2,282, and two schools um, didn’t stick with us, because there was change of administration and so in the second year, we had about 1,500 students, three schools, in the first year, it was five schools. 22 counselors are in the first year, 12 in the second year. These are participant descriptors. This was the very dee…all of the schools were very-very diverse and pretty much many of them, three of them were racially homogenous, pretty much the same, they were either all African-American or lots are all Latino and Hispanic, so, we’ve very diverse schools But this is the meet of the study and let me just share a little bit with you about what we found as far as perceptions of school counselors and if you see here, I have circled one that we thought as a team was very indicative of some of the trainee that needs to be done. We found when we asked the students, my high school counselor helped me to write a college application essay and the students were in the disagree range and so what we know about first year college students or first year perspective college students is that writing their college essay is critic…is a critical key and so the counselors it’s seems as though cross the board of all the schools were not…the students didn’t feel or perceive as their counselors is not helping them with that. That was troubling to us. Overall, as you see most of the means were in the two point range that is in the disagree range, so we were not pleased with that all, but the perceptions of the students or that their school counselors weren’t as helpful with them with some of the nuts and bolts um, college readiness, college admissions process. However, at the other end of the continuants, students perceptions of their counselors as far as their personal and professional qualities was much higher, was in the agree range. So, my counselor is concerned about my future, knows a lot about colleges and university, knows about college admission process, believes that I can go to college and is dependable, those things were rather, those items are fairly high. Overall, after talking, working in these schools for two years, we found that, the students overall like their counselors, and they thought they were great people, they say that their counselor smiled a lot, but when they came to doing the work around college, that’s where we saw some disparity. Student’s perceptions of their counselors around other personal and professional qualities, my counselors easy to talk to, is a good listener, all of these again were in the higher range. It reminds me if I forgot something, replace that in there, because there is some literature that says that counsel, people there kind of coach and go after students, remind them… if they…if they got the application in that kind of work, um…tends to work and we saw that some of the students were that was in that range between agree and disagree. There is a little over than the others. The counselors perceptions of their role and the college preparation process, um, was fairly high. We felt that the counselors and after talking to them in interviews, um the counselors felt that they… they should play a role in the college preparation process and they felt that was a part of their role. They did not think, it went down, helping students with college essays again, it went down, some they didn’t feel and counselors said “I don’t feel as my place to help them with essays”. So that’s an area again that we really I think should explore more, ah, but as far as counselor perceptions of that role in writing college essays. Filling our financial aid forms as an another area. Um, that we should investigate further, by the way, in year 2, the results pretty much match the same um, there was not very much significant change from year 1 to year 2 and because the issues with not being able to get students codes, we were not able to track the same students from 1 year to the next, um, which would have been very interesting and that could, someone could do that in the future, but we did find that filling out financial aid forms, fill it finishing or helping students submit, um college essays is something that counselors perceive that is not being their role. Counselor beliefs, another interesting point about our research is that we found that counselors believe that they have their skills and knowledge, overall knowledge to do this kind of work, but guess what they feel they don’t have, time. Not surprising with the all the other things that they’re doing. So that’s sort of confirm what we know about the structural um, constraints. I pull(ph) this who was the first person to give you advice about the courses to take, to gain college admission and guess who it is, parents, parents so students are talking to parents. We weren’t surprise by that, but at the same time, these were schools where parent, most of the parents or majority of parents are not going to college. So as when we talk about college information coming from a group of parents that know very little that could be problematic. And look where counselor is. So, we were hoping to see counselor way up here in stead of back that way. And this by the way are number of students, so we didn’t do that percentage wise as number of students in each area. How often have you discussed college admission requirements with each of the following people?, we see parents many times and your high school counselor 26%. We wanted to see much higher percentage of students saying that they spend, they talked to their counselors many times about going to college or the college admission requirements. The time that counselors spend on college related tasks um, we were surprised to see that some of the counselors spent very little time of what we consider to be important task for getting kids into college like reviewing SAT and PSAT data um, reviewing data related to AP testing and so forth. So once again, we’re seeing what we weren’t expecting to see at the same time, we weren’t surprised, because these schools are not schools that have a very high college going rate. And once again, my high school counselor helped me too, do better in school was the highest mean here, um, but understanding the difference between early decision and early action applications and those kinds of things, they are fairly low. So, what does this mean. All these numbers and all of this, what does this mean for us. Well, my belief is that we need to join in this educational reform movement and voice how school counseling is critical to the educational development of schools, because this is our skill set. Career development should be our thing and I’d always think about we should reclaim this area. It is our thing. We should be the experts on getting kids ready for college and post secondary opportunities. So, I believe it’s time for shift. We are partly there, because we’re more than ever before invested in diversity, advocacy of a data-driven programming, team work, collaboration, all of those things are what we need. Those are the… the seeds have been planted. 

00:27:00
From • Little to no emphasis on college admissions counseling and college readiness in school counselor preparation To • Strong emphais and “infused” training on college readiness, college admissions counseling and career development throughout school counselor preparation Proposal for a shift in the School Counseling Profession 

00:27:00
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY But my proposal is that we shift our counselor training to include a stronger emphasis on college and career readiness. I don’t think that this is …this is really like revisiting our heritage. We’ve been there before and it means that we’re simply embracing it again and become that…we become more heavily involved in college and career counseling in relating the work that we do to college and career readiness and schools. This also means that we ask ourselves or we training and preparing pre-service school counselors to do this kind of work. If not, I believe, if we do not address this as counselor educators then we risk being left out of the educational reforming issue instead I listed today and ultimately, we could be placing our profession at risk. In Baltimore for instance where are now I’m working, there are several new college counseling or coaching organizations that are emerging all over the place and these organizations are providing the extra support that counselors need in high schools, particularly urban high need schools, but…but the frustrating thing for me is that many administrators see these coaches as being substitute counselors and they’re choosing to hire these coaches rather than school counselors and some are even opting to say, we don’t need school counselors. This is the work that this group can do for us and that’s very troubling to me. So, here are my take-aways from my talk. I don’t have anything to give you per se, but hopefully, you will take this away and remember this. 

00:28:35
What arte the take-aways for counselor educators? Continue to emphasize advocacy, diversity, and community building…link these concepts to college and career readiness Train school counselors to think systemically Discuss with trainees how current practices contribute to the disparities in college access Include college and career readiness knowledge and skills in program curricula (infuse or sole-concern approach) Use the EACH philosophy as a training framework. Equitable opportunities Access to opportunities Caring adults High expectations 

00:28:40
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY I think we should continue to emphasize advocacy, diversity, and community building, but we need to link all of those things to college and career readiness and college access. I also think we need to train or continue to train school counselors to think systemically. We need to include parents and neighborhoods and community stakeholders in all of the work that we do and we should train our students to do the same. Partnerships I believe, in partnerships and partnerships with communities and families are vitable… a are vital to making sustainable change. We also need to discuss with trainees and I do this with my students often to discuss how our current educational and school counseling practices are really contributing to the disparities that we see in college access. We had need to have those real serious conversations and supervision about what students are seeing and how that might be contributing to the disparities that we see. We also need to include college and career readiness knowledge and skills in the program curricula. We can either infuse or have a sole course. I was really happy to see that (inaudible ), I don’t know if he is here or not has a really a new certificate program in college admissions or college counseling. I think this is the way we need to go with school counseling, to figure out creative and innovative ways that we can not only train the students that are in our programs, but also train existing counselors who may not have gotten this kind of training. And we need to use that EACH child philosophy that is all about equitable opportunities, access to those opportunities. We need caring adults, which can be the counselor in a school and some other folks that want to come on board in high expectations. The recipe for success for students and we need to train our school counseling students pre-service counselors to use that in their work and everything that they do. I also believe that we need to measure graduate students’ ability to implement college readiness tasks. We are doing our CACREP self study. I can’t believe I’m actually I can stand and see light right now, because I’ve been immersed in CACREP’s standards, I know all of you can…can feel for me on that one. Um, but one thing that we were looking at on our school counseling program is how do we actually measure these kinds of tasks. These things that we want students to do in order to get students in schools, K-12 students ready for college and so we’re doing unique tasks like having students right recommendation letters as part of the internship and these are ways that we can ensure that these are behaviors and these are the performance of our students as guiding how we measure them and grade them. 

00:31:35
What are the take away for Counselor educator? Measure graduate students’ ability to Implement college readiness tasks (e.g. college counseling writing recommendation letters) Build partnerships with colleges and university admissions offices Build partnerships with college and university admissions offices, We must engage in research that demonstrates the efficacy of training and practice in college and career readiness on student outcomes. More college graduates of underrepresented groups! We can make it happen! “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.” Charles Darwin 

00:31:35
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY I also think it’s important build partnerships with colleges and university admissions offices. One of the great thing that I found when I was at the University of Maryland is that our admissions office loved our school counseling program, because they saw that as being the gate to getting more graduates to come into Maryland, so they would come over and help us with the content of our college counseling seminar course and that was a really nice help. And last, but not least, certainly not least, I’m a believer in research and we must engage as counselor educators and research and I’m so happy to see doctoral students here. I wanted to go to the round table because I want to put a plug in for doctoral students to do research in this area. Um, so I’m making my plug now. We need research from counselor educators in this area. Right now, there are more higher head people that are taking about us and what we do. So, we must engage in research that demonstrates the efficacy of training and practice that we’re doing in school counseling and college and career readiness and linking that the student outcomes, K12 student outcomes. This is the huge need for us that we’re again embracing and reclaiming this career and college readiness peace. So, I’m a lover of dogs, you know I’m getting to the end of my talk when I show dogs. We’re getting to the end to the finish line and what I see is the finish line is having more college graduates having our counselors prepare to make that happen and so what we want to see on the other side are more college graduates of underrepresented groups and we can make it happen. And one of my favorite, favorite quotes and I’m gonna leave you with this is that “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.” Charles Darwin said that and so what better way for us when we talk about educational reform. We really talking about change in schools and for us to be strong, it’s for us to react and respond to change that’s there. We can’t ignore it. If we want to survive it, we’re going to have to respond to what’s going on and so I leave with that. I’m gonna open it with questions, but I do want to say “I’m so happy to be here and to be able to talk to you about this, because I know this is the group that can make it happen.

Q & A 

00:34:05
CHERYL HOLCOMB-MCCOY So the question is what do you say to students that say um, um, it’s my value to go to college, but they don’t feel us their right to impose that value on others. Um, you know I see that…that this is not being necessarily um, a value you’re giving them an option that you’re allowing students to have options, never I said is all about access to opportunity, so we want kids to be ready to have If they wanna go to college that they can actually go. Um, is not necessarily a value is just having access to opportunities. That’s what I would tell them and if they don’t value college and they decide not to go than that’s their decision, um, but the worst thing, the opposite of that could happen, which does happen as kids want to go to college, they get to the 11th grade and they’re not ready and it becomes it’s not an option to them or better yet we find kids that will say, I never knew that I could go to college. I mean that's to me even more damaging so I think that is a conversation to have with students. Um, I also have students that will tell me well um, not everybody has to go to college, why are we pushing this college thing. Um, and it's true, but if we look at this statistics 20 years ago, 50 years ago, and if you didn't go to college you could pretty much make it on the high school diploma and do pretty well, um, but now if you look at the statistics and you look at the outlook on jobs. If you do not have some type of college or postsecondary experience, you’re not going to be able to survive or live what I consider to be a middle class lifestyle and what I found in Baltimore city, we did a um, one-year program with middle school students in Baltimore and when we went into the classrooms we asked the kids, “How many of you want to go to college.” Every hand went up. So they have high aspirations, they want to do this and though we started to talking about “What would you want in 15 years? What kind of life do you want?” They all want nice cars, nice clothes, designer clothes that they want all the things that other kids want. If you go out and if we ask any kid, um but their lack of knowing how to get that or knowing that these things are an option for the colleges are way to get there, there was a very, there was a very big disconnect between wanting it aspiring for it and knowing how to get there and so I think that you when we educated the kids there about what it would take to have these things, they started really calculating that may be I need to go this way and I don't know how many of you know this that in Baltimore and DC area, many of the parents in the area are government workers. I mean, there is a large group of people, adults that have worked for the government and many of those folks did not go to college, but have done very well, but what we are seeing now as far as job outlooks that those government jobs now are competitive even for college graduates. So explaining that to students that this is not your parents world. It is really important for them to know. So I think is educating the students and having those talks with them. When I say students are graduate students and helping them to understand um, job outlook, to understand their community that they are thinking that they are going to work in, um really you know taking it a part and having a real critique of what it would take to get their students to the place that they can be happy and successful and responsible citizens, because that's what it's all about. Then with the picture I showed you about the little boy. You know I would look at that picture often I think how would, what would we have to do to ensure that he has the opportunity that he needs and counselors can do that work and this is also not saying that “We’re not.” Some of my friend said “ But Cheryl, what are you saying? You are saying that we shouldn't be counselors anymore. Aren't you going backwards, isn’t this the whole educational thing that we are trying, we are mental health professionals? Yes, but this counseling, college counseling is a part of our identity. The career counseling piece is a part of our identity. I am not losing my counselor identity. ”But we also in schools, we have to connect with educational goals what's going on around this. And so that's the part about you know responding to the change and things that are going on in our context in our schools. So good question. Well, in the schools, remember we’re only taking these five schools, but we had an item about working with the English department around the essays and that kind of thing, working with teachers, um, there was a very, there was… most of the schools that did not happen and remember that these five schools are high need schools, so we weren’t expecting to see um, wonderful innovative things. We just wanted to see what is and what is, is counselors in these schools were not connecting with the teachers around college going college access. This has more to do with culture. I think you as well as riding of the study, the culture of the high schools was that this was not an expectation that these were graduation only schools. I call them you know the…the goal was to get the kids out and to graduate them. It was not to get them to college, so as a recommendation to the schools and to the districts we were saying that you know this is has to be a cultural shift for the entire school. So, yes the teachers have to become more involved. It has what a partnership between those in the schools, but in these schools it didn't happen. We didn't talk to teachers though, we are just talk to counselors, so the counselors were reporting that teachers were coming to them to complain about scheduling, to complain about kids in their classes, but not around the college going process and that was disappointment. Absolutely right, that students, not all students are going to go to college right after high school and so that's important. So, you know rewording it or re-labeling it could be helpful, but I do believe that if you think about private schools for instance and you know I have go around to private schools and there they don't stop from saying college um, and so the issue for us, is as we think about closing gaps, is that some of this, you know the semantics are an… you know important sometimes so we have the same expectations for kids and downtown Newark than we do for outside of Newark, and the suburbs that if they are here in college to kids, they are need to here college, but you are absolutely right that we have to think about other avenues, creative avenues for getting kids ready for college and might not be right after high school, but it could be for later. As long if the kid wants it and that's their goal. Then I think as counselors, our job is to help them get there and so you know we could talk about, we do see that postsecondary opportunities, postsecondary opportunities, but the issue here is that when we look at again the job outlook that the jobs are gonna to be there for kids that are spending some time in college, whether it would be community college or four year college experience. But thank you all and thank you for listening, it is a great fun.
