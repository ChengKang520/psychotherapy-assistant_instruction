NOTABLE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PERSONALITY Series PCR: Films and Video in the Behavioral Sciences Penn State Audio-Visual Services University Park, PA 16802 ROLLO MAY'S DISCUSSION WITH RICHARD EVANS: MATURITY AND CREATIVITY MATURITY AND CREATIVITY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS CRITICS FUTURE PLANS 

00:00:25
RICHARD EVANS Rollo May received his PhD in psychology at Columbia University in 1949. After receiving training in psychoanalysis in Vienna, he became a supervisory training analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in New York City. He has held many distinguished academic quotes. In addition to formal of theological training, he had extensive contact with the late Paul Tillich. To a set provocative books as Love and Will and The Meaning of Anxiety, he soon became a leader in the American existential and humanistic movements. After many years of residence in New York City, he currently lives on Tiburon, California where he continues his reading and the practice of psychotherapy. We were pleased to complete this discussion with Doctor May in his home in Tiburon. 

00:01:15
RICHARD EVANS Of course, always-- almost from its inception, ah, the field of psychology, the field of psychiatry, the field of sociology, in fact, most of social sciences had been interested in the notion of maturity. Ah, how do you view this, ah, concept of maturity Doctor May. 

00:01:35
ROLLO MAY Ah, I remember when, ah, Eagleton, Senator Eagleton, ah, had just been, ah, thrown overboard, uhm, by McGovern because he'd spent two, ah, he spent, ah, several months in the mental hospital. Ah, everybody then was talking about the fact that, that, uhm, he'd been depressed and does this mean that he would be immature to views your phrase, ah, and would be, uhm, harmful as a senator. Well, I was very strongly oppose to that point of view and I said over the cabaret show on New York, uhm, that, uhm, I felt that Senator Eagleton, ah, ah, by my definition of mental health which was, ah, somebody who can have empathy with his fellow man, somebody who was not a, ah, a robot, somebody who, uhm, exuded understanding, ah, even though they were depressed. This was in my definition a-- of a better, ah, ah, concept of mental health then and I said than, then the present-- pre, ah, eye keeper of the White House, meaning Nixon. Now I do think this is true. I think Nixon is essentially a robot man with, uhm, a shell of, uhm, motivation, ah, by-- the shell is made up entirely of power. Everything that can be, ah, used for his own power is sought after whereas, Eagleton who is depressed, to my mind was a much richer human being, ah, and that reminded me Lincoln. Lincoln was a very depressed man. If Lincoln had live in our day, he would have been shocked into a mental hospital in a hurry, given some drugs of what the, that would have been a tre-- tremendously, ah, dangerous or detrimental thing to do. Now, often people can, ah, live with depressions and use the depression or the anxiety or the whatever the struggle maybe and as a way of increasing their understanding of other people. We can understand other, ah, people's depressions because we are depressed at times. We can understand their grief because we also have grief. Now, that's what I would make my first characteristic of the mature person, the mentally healthy person, and the person who can, ah, experience the griefs, the, ah, joys, ah, of all the people was a good fellow man, ah, and, ah, that respect. Now beyond that, uh-hmm, well, this includes being able to communicate with others, interpersonal relationships, ah, valuable and so on. Beyond that, I shy away from making definitions of maturity because everybody that makes them-- the secret they puts himself in the very high category and it looks as though it was something you achieve. Something you achieve by hard work. I don't think this is true at all. Now certainly, you and I are more mature now than we were 20 years ago but these doesn't mean that maturity is something we're going to achieve by the age of 75 then we're gonna die and only we never gets closer to it. I think the aim of life, ah, can he be expressed much more deeply by-- a much more accurately by saying that it is the capacity to be sensitive. The capacity to be aware of the things that are affecting you and how you are affecting other people. The capacity to empathize, and that the goal is really an extension of our, ah, sense of, of, ah, consciousness rather than to arrive at any particular, uhm, one, two, three. Now these brings me to the person or personal growth. Uh-hmm, I've been-- I am an, a, ah, humanist as you know and I am also an existentialist but the talk about, ah, the growth, uhm, groups, a growth theories, a growth experiences, I always find, uhm, unpleasant because people talk as though today they grow closer to some ideal or they would go to this, ah, the joyousness of growth, ah, institutional or go to this growth weekend and they will get closer to some strange kind of aim. I don't think this is really the point. Growth you see, can be good or bad. Growth becomes also makes you one day near to your death, to be a cancer is a growth. There's all, all kinds of thing is about growth that are not necessarily good. Ah, what we want is a certain kind of, I would even use the word growth. Growth is a biological term. In a narrow sense, ah, I would use a psychological term, development, ah, or expansion of the self. One has courage, one has will, one can love but all of these are very dubious, ah, ways of talking because if you say one can love, ah, do you mean he can love better than somebody else? Well I think that's absurd. I believe that actually, ah, the goal of human life is the extension of awareness, of consciousness meaning the capacity about empathy and understanding for other people and beyond that, uhm, I don't see any, ah, specific, any things you can achieve. 

00:07:55
RICHARD EVANS Well, of course, ah, when, when those signs and, and then nastily use of phrase, of term of like self-actualization. 

00:08:05
ROLLO MAY That's a different thing. 

00:08:05
RICHARD EVANS Now they were obviously talking about something differently - 

00:08:10
ROLLO MAY Yeah. 

00:08:10
RICHARD EVANS - a product of growth or they not. 

00:08:10
ROLLO MAY Yup, that's right. Though I, I, ah, think of self-actualization is a good word. It comes originally from, from, ah, Goldstein, ah, and it means that the human being is at every instance in his life involved in, in, ah, using, ah, his, ah, possibilities. Self-actualization means that here is, an, an organism that has consciousness version, ah, and you try to put this into action. You don't simply set aside or let it drift, you think about this idea or you do this particular thing or you see somebody you like and you speak to them or you, you develop this particular friendship. Now that would goes, ah, and this meant all those things. It's a term that go on stand uses, uhm, from (inaudible ). (inaudible ) said that, ah, that spirit is possibility and Goldstein kept talking about possibility or potentiality which means the same thing. Potentiality being actualize, uhm, which is self-actualization. Now there is no use in that sense also sometimes Maslow did tend to use in the sense of simple growth, I grow more today than I did yesterday and those, uhm, those ways are as I said I agree with. But, ah, by in line, self-actualization, I do agree with it and I think it's a good term. 

00:09:50
RICHARD EVANS One of your very recent books is entitled Courage to Create. Ah, would you care to talk a bit more about, ah, your work on creativity. 

00:10:05
ROLLO MAY I think creativity is the bringing together of two, uhm, ah, forms like ideas, ideas are forms or painting, uhm, the or what you paint, ah, these also are forms. Uhm, projects are forms and you bring together these, you exist at an intensity of experiences at the moment of creativity. Intensity that I describe earlier as the pause, ah, in which you decide to throw your weight this way rather than that way. The pause that characterizes freedom, that's another intensity. It always involves some creative form but you have to throw your weight in a way that's slightly new from where it was before. Just as the world goes on all the time. Now this means in something new. Some new form is born and this new form, uhm, ah, is a, ah, what we call it, the product of creativity and the artist is very clear, the new painting is born out of continuous rebirth of forms. In the human being, ah, new ideas are, ah, born. Those are forms, uhm, new, new, ah, plans, new potentialities. Well, all of this is, ah, I would allow under the general heading of creativity and I think it's a great, ah, ki-- criticism of academic psychology that they have studied creativity so little. They studied in creative people but the creative act is still completely clear off. It's gonna take a broader psychology for us to understand the creative act than, ah, we, uhm, we know how. Now this creativity, uhm, I would call, ah, one of the, ah, aspect of self-actualization. I would put it with other things like joy, like power, uhm, ah, like love, uhm, and you could say if you wanted to that these were the, uhm, ah, signs of, of maturity of a person. So you see I don't like that phrase. Uhm, they are, they are certainly the content of life that we are all to strive for. The more love I have in my life, the more love or communications at same thing or creativity or a power, uhm, the more I am able to, ah, ah, to actualize myself, the more than, ah, I experience in my consciousness, the more my consciousness is expanded. Though all of these stuff I would regard as creative, ah, real love is creative. Uhm, the, ah, ah, power ought to be creative. If it's constructive power, it is creative and this is why I would write a book, uhm, a Courage to Create and, uhm, and very glad I did. 

00:13:30
RICHARD EVANS Of course, sort of summarizing the work of psychological researchers in area of creativity, they have been exploring the creative person. They have been exploring the, ah, creative environment. They have been trying to study the creative product or as you have been talking about the creative process. But they all repeatedly seem to encounter the same problem, that is the amount of simplicity of definitions of creativity. What exactly is creativity? How do you, ah, deal with this problem, the meaning of creativity? 

00:14:00
ROLLO MAY Creativity is perpetually the birth of something new that is then springs up and it is, it's creative precisely because there's something different about it. You couldn't have predicted it ahead of time. Now, I for one belief that, ah, psychology ought to take in to its realms. These uses of imagination, the chance of studying something where you cannot get the control and prediction but you can get a vast understanding. In my PhD thesis, I was very grateful to the professors at Columbia for letting me study anxiety though I knew I couldn't get any control or prediction about the anxiety. Uhm, but, but then they let me study it because, ah, they, ah, well, had some confidence in me even though normally they wouldn't have done that, that was against the psychological, uhm, principles. But I think we have to have more studies like that, studies that are, uhm, that bring together the different theories, ah, theoretical studies for example. Studies that, ah, involve, ah, the dynamics of the human being just before he gets agree any of the idea. That would be very interesting and there are number of another studies I could suggest to you. And you will not fit in the category of control, control and prediction. I think they had be tremendously valuable. 

00:15:40
RICHARD EVANS You really saying than at the previous where we surgically interviewed has been a victim of, of the scientific method, you're almost saying it in a - 

00:15:45
ROLLO MAY Well, of what we think is the scientific method - 

00:15:45
RICHARD EVANS Yes, so what we think it is yes. 

00:15:50
ROLLO MAY I, I think that we in psychology hang on to fine arts when all kind of science that was true in the physical science 50 year, years ago. 

00:16:00
RICHARD EVANS Now, one of the things we've been talking about a number of your contributions and it will be very opting I think for as soon as to hear what you, yourself considered to be your most important contributions? 

00:16:15
ROLLO MAY Well, if I had to talk with you very frankly, uhm, and right at the top of my hat, I would say that my most important contribution is that I'm a renegade. I don't set. Ah, sure, I get honorary degrees and everything of that sort and I'm invited to give it, address at APA. But essentially, I see myself as a frontiers one, as a pioneer, and I find as I look back, this is quite unconscious incidentally, that I'm not aware of this at the time. As I look back I see that when that I was psychologist, therapist, psychoanalyst, when there were practically no psychologist in the field and when we had to fight the AMA, ah, at every turn in order to even survive. But we did fight them and ultimately we did like them. So now in psychology, can psychologist can also do therapy. Ah, then I was an existentialist or that word was that even know in this country. Ah, I help introduce that, that came after the, ah, fight against the AMA and that also required same kind of pioneer, ah, spirit. From then, uhm, as well like the existentialist then became absorb into many kinds of therapy in this country, uhm, I became a, ah, humanist. Ah, the, the real frontier then was on the theory humanistic psychology, what does it mean? And in what way, is it like the theory of the, ah, of the, ah, physicist and so on. The understanding of science from, the point of view of humanistic psychology. Well, ah, I like that term and I think I'm obvious going to be a pioneer. Pioneer from different profession. I was first a teacher, then a psychoanalyst, now I'm mostly a writer. There are number of ideas that I've regard myself having made contribution for humans freedom, responsibility, will. They knew it, ah, understanding of, ah, the meaning of love but all those we've talk about. 

00:18:40
RICHARD EVANS Yes. All right now, uhm, what criticisms of your work had bother you the most, if any? 

00:18:50
ROLLO MAY Well, the criticisms that bother me most and, ah, those some that certainly do bother me a good deal. I'm not but once against me. It's amazing how much you can learn from, ah, respected person who happens to have a different point of view and writes a criticism of your work. Uhm, the-- this can be a very good thing and the thing you like that bothers me most the other sloppy, ah, criticisms that are not, uhm, that come out of simply personal ranker. And I often get such criticisms, I shouldn't say often but I do from time to time in psychological journals because I'm a renegade and they hate my guts. Ah, I'm not really an aggressive person but they-- and like assume so and, ah, there are their sloppy review. Uhm, the, ah, the Courage to Create kind of relatively sloppy review. Love and Will, when it first came up as reviewed by a psychologist in a psychiatric journal and absolutely, ah, it alienated and he wipe the deck with it, accused me of artificially trying to promote joy and other such terrible things. Now it's all happen that Love and Will became a very important book and that, that guy said, eat his word, ah, words. Perhaps, he have made in time since then. But, that bothers me and it bothers me because, ah, not that I believe it but did I think can I be so, ah, wrong in expecting what, what's going on in our world. Why is it that, ah, that my communication wasn't better? Ah, how can it be that somebody so misunderstands what, what I'm, uhm, I'm trying to say, that this is the way it bothers me. 

00:21:00
RICHARD EVANS Well, now, ah, as you look ahead now, what, what, ah, what, what's up now? What are you planning to do? What are your process or doing now for example when you look through the future? 

00:21:10
ROLLO MAY Well, I'm now in process of writing, ah, another book in anxiety and this will be called Anxiety and Values because values as you remember in your work with, with, ah, (inaudible ) ah, admission state college, the values are becoming the more important, more and more important item in our psychological thinking and activity. Values are going to become an end, matter of fact I think they're already could be said to be an end topic. In 10 years ago, this wasn't so at all, 20 years ago, ah, the psychologist did not admit even that values existed. I exaggerate but you, you get the point. Now the reason anxiety is important is that anxiety and values work on teeter-totter. The more anxiety in the culture that down, the less the values in that culture like our present culture. And as the values go up, people believe in the values, ah, the anxiety goes down. This is where a lot of young people are on to these religious organizations cuz there they can find some values. But actually it make the anxiety considerably less as its teeter-totter effect like that. Now the anxiety that we now feel almost universally in this country will be adequately answered only by the rediscovery of values, of some new and tangible, some variable, uhm, ah, values that people can genuinely believe in. I think for example women's liberation or the deliberation of human beings, ah, it regards, this going to mean men's liberation, too. This is an important value, ah, saying the, ah, the one world concept, ah, that this is also an important value. Uhm, the, ah, uhm, control of, ah, pollution, that is a new relationship to the Earth of the green, ah, the greening that is go-- going on among young people in the and then the cumulants, this is also an important value. And this thing, ah, as this things becomes stronger, the anxiety of people will, ah, be decrease. This is why a book that I'm working on is called Anxiety and Values. Then I also want to, uh-hmm, write a book on mythology like your friend, Jung. Ah, mythology and psychological integration cuz I don't believe you become really integrated psychologically unless-- until you find your own myth and until you can look at your society in terms of its, ah, mask, the myth, that the important thing in life is, is how much money you'll make. For example, this is a modern myth, I think that has to be seeing from the false myth it has and, uhm, then we have better myth. And then third day, I want to write a book on theory of humanistic psychology and fourthly I want to do my autobiography. And fifthly, I will then have thought of 10 other one. 

00:24:40
RICHARD EVANS Get me through you, ah, pattern. Uhm, ah, now, one of the things that seems to me that I observe about you Doctor May is that you're perceived quite differently by different public. For example, there are theologians whom I'm spoken that sees you, sees you as theologian. There are, uhm, psychologist with whom I speak who sees you as a psychologist. There are, ah, ah, humanist who perceived you as a humanist, ah, and so on and so forth, uhm, and it's obviously interesting to speculate about how you can seem to integrate all this roles. Would you care to tell me about this? 

00:25:25
ROLLO MAY Well, that's always a puzzling question to me, cuz I wonder why-- is it any problem? I mean why, does it need to be integrated? I mean why is there any problem in the integration of it? To me, these things, all of it, ah, naturally. I'm also very often, ah, called a philosopher. I'm also very often called mythologist. But it seems to me that by nature, these things are all part of the, ah, human being, ah, and if I may use the word being, ah, in a sentence it means a great deal to me and we, the being that is me or as you and the being that is threatened in anxiety but I experienced in myself as this being, this is what we called anthology. Now it seems to me that as you grow in to be true, the world goes inside you. You have to take in, certainly, some philosophy, some theology. You certainly have to take in some mythology, you have to be a psychologist in knowing yourself. Ah, though the reason, I think that you asked the question is, ah, itself, ah, product of the fact that we split psychology up into all these different divisions. We think how that somebody unite, ah, his humanism with the psychology. Well, it's a problem only if you've already made out a psychology kind of behavior as someone say. That would quite antithetical to philosophy or to, ah, to, ah, humanism. I believe this things are naturally part of my own-- of breath of life and I, ah, ah, want to leave them out and not because they are different field. I, I don't change coats from I go-- when I go from one to another. You are interviewing me for, uhm, something quite different, quite different purpose, I still would say very much the same thing. I think, ah, ah, as any full human being, ah, we odd and potentially can all, uhm, uhm, put a spade in these different activities. 

00:27:50
RICHARD EVANS Well, ah, Doctor May, thank you so much. 

00:27:55
ROLLO MAY You're welcome.
