OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE HOLISTIC COUNSELLING IN A MULTICULTURAL SECONDARY SCHOOL 

00:00:00
CLAIRE FERGUSSON I'm Claire Fergusson and for the last eight and a bit years I have been a counselor at Aorere College, which is in Papatoetoeand in the part of Auckland called South Auckland, we people dream to go. Today, I want to talk about what we're doing at our school. And I have called it out of our comfort zone. And since I have been at Aorere, I think all the people who work there have been thrust out of the comfort zone. For a start it was me, I had worked on South Auckland previously, so I wasn't completely ah… as unstuck as I was when I first went out there because every belief and assumption that I had about life was seriously challenged in the two years when I worked at another school there. When I arrived at Aorere, the school was in the process of lot of change, a lot of had had been thrust upon the school by outside. The school heading to the… to the bulk funding scheme and when that scheme was terminated at the change of government. The school was in all sorts of trouble and a lot of staff had to be let go and it was a very, very disjointed and unhappy place. Let's see if I can make this go, yeah. 

00:01:50
AORERE COLLEGE • Decile 2 Secondary School • Papatoetoe, South Auckland • 1550 students • 80 teachers • 40+ethnic groups 

00:01:50
CLAIRE FERGUSSON So, I found working in the school, which had huge challenges and being old I came from a kind of more gentler time in New Zealand history, when there wasn't such a huge difference between the people who had, it was me and the people who economically had not. So we had to find a way of being. So let's have a look at Aorere College. It is Decile 2 and for people from out of New Zealand our schools are range from 1 to 10 according to the socioeconomic status. So Decile 2 is down there. It's in Papatoetoe, where on the road that divides Papatoetoe from Mangere. So we've got students from both sides of that road. We've got 1550 students, about 80 teachers, and at the last count I think we had 40 something ethnic groups represented in the student body and I would think that be 15 or 20 in the teacher body. When we think of cultural group ethnicity, we sort of think is this person from Samoa. Are they Pakeha, a New Zealander. But these are whole lot more cultures operating in the student body than just, who it happened to have for parents. Ah… the kids tend to try and how immediately seal bits of the lives. Ah… they keep the family stuff in the family. They keep the church stuff in the church. They keep the school stuff and the friendship stuff and they try to keep them all in these little boxes and hope that nobody from other boxes sees in. So the kids belong to heaps of different cultural groups. The sports teams, the churches, other religious groups. The music groups, academic groups, various other clubs they belong to. There are other not quite so mainstream cultures that they belong to, to and there are a foreign country to me don't know whether I'm happy to say the gangster culture, the drug culture. In our area, there are street cultures and we have certain streets the X, Y, Z street and there will be called the X, Y, Z street boys and these guys really stick together as a group. And in between there are fluid groups too, they see(ph) electronic culture ah… much more familiar territory to the youth than to people like me. I have steadfastly avoided getting onto Facebook, because I do need to sleep and if I'm on Facebook I'll be up all night. 

00:05:10
STUDENT SERVICES 2002 • No central site • One counsellor on periphery of school, primitive building • Deans in several sites • Careers in a cramped classroom • Nurse doubled as print room manager • No Social Workers 

00:05:10
CLAIRE FERGUSSON So, when I started there in 2002, we had very little in the way of a cohesive student services center. They had me, I was in a little all prefab(ph) right away from everything and had no water and it did have a electric light. We don't have a computer in there, because nothing was hoped up. The deans rule over the places they work wherever they could. Careers was stuck in a classroom, which hadn't been modified at all. The nurse(ph) at the time was an enrolled nurse(ph) but her main job was running the print shop. We didn't have a social worker. So it was pretty challenging in those days, but a new principal had arrived, just before I did and I was one of his experiments. Ah… he wanted, he had this dream of having a one stop shop for the school, where the students other than education needs would be met. So he had decided before I've got the way(ph) this was to be and roughly help was to be arranged. But more importantly than that we were looking for a way to draw the staff back together. There were huge rifts in the staff because people had to be ah… let go, I think they say, had to go find another job. There were people who were still loyal to the old system and anything to do with the new system was anathema. So we had to find a way to pull everyone together and we decided to join a program run by the ministry of education called eliminating violence and the, I guess the safest aim of that is to make the kids and the teachers get on better to give up… and stop beating each other. So we joined up with that and I had been involved in that in another school and that was an amazing experience. And more recently, we have been working as a staff to embrace the new New Zealand curriculum and this is an extremely holistic document, because it doesn't just cover the academic things that you teach that you do quadratic equations and a little bit of Shakespeare and this and that. It also looks at the whole child and I have eliminated those slides because otherwise we'd be here till dinner time. But there are things in that that are really pertinent to the counseling and student welfare. Things like the values of diversity, equity, integrity, respect key competencies, thinking, how we use language and I don't like a team but managing self, which to me is looking after yourself so that you're okay and you can engage with others, relating to others and the vision is that we'll be lifelong learners and hopefully that is beginning to be implemented in our school and out of the eliminating violence program. 

00:08:55
The Aorere Way • The glue that holds our school together • Attitude • Organization • Respect • Expectations • Routines • Enjoyment 

00:09:00
CLAIRE FERGUSSON We work together in groups in this workshop and out of that came the Aorere way and the acronyms down the side and those this is the glue that holds our school together. We entered into the Aorere way in 2003, we still have a committee, one member from each department meets probably twice a term and we plan all sorts of things to improve the cohesiveness of our school to make the school spirit, alive and grow and this involves not only the students, but the staff. 

00:09:45

00:09:50
• Division of Labor - who does what • Depends on trust and teamwork • Shared values • Like a machine that is driven by common goals and shared vision 

00:09:50
CLAIRE FERGUSSON You know, moving away from the Aorere way program look at the way that we do things in our students services department. We haven't yet managed to find a nicer name for it than that. The first thing that we've worked towards and it wasn't at a meeting or anything. We've evolved. We are very evolutionary, I don't think with the revolutionary ah… the division of labor, who does what? We found overtime that if certain things were handled by certain people it didn't move that well. For example, if you're having a group of students in a serious conflict, they would head off to the social workers and talk to them. We found later that the deans would end up having to redo this work, because the deans had a bigger more ecological view of the students. They knew who they have friendship and non friendship groups are. They teach at the junior levels, they teach nearly every child in the dean(ph) level. So we decided that anything to do with conflict and he said, she said and all that sort of things, the deans deal with it. They have all been trained and restore out(ph) of process. So it's not a big nasty discipline thing. It's a friendly working together to solve the problem a way of doing it. This depends on trust and teamwork. All of us in our building and will come to who works in their in a minute. We all work together as a team. Ah… I'm not the sort of counselor that has the sort of mystified, you know I'm a counselor and I can only work in my room sort of way. We all pitch in together, we're there because we value each other and we are therefore for one reason and that's the welfare and the wellbeing of the students that are entrusted to our care. So we sort of like a machine, we work because we've got a common destination. 

00:12:20
STUDENT SERVICES 2010 • All under one roof • 15 Counsellors plus several counsellors in training, part time • 2 full time Social Workers • Fully staffed Careers Centre • Seven Deans housed in large room • 2 full time registered Nurses, plus additional visiting specialists • Free doctor one morning per week, plus access to doctor at her rooms at other times • Visiting alcohol and drug counsellors once a week • Police Officer on site 2 days a week 

00:12:25
CLAIRE FERGUSSON Right in eight years, the student services department has become extremely complicated and you can see them all up there. So we're all under one roof. We've got one-and-a-half employed counselors and we're really blessed, because we've got quite a few people who are either in training or they qualified and want to get their hours to get membership. So we've always got people to listen to students. We've got two full-time social workers and in the crisis system that we have in New Zealand we don't employ them someone else does and it works quite well. We have got a well staffed career centre with two women full time and they are assisting students in a variety of ways plus a teacher, who is the driver of it. We've got seven deans all in one great big room. We've got two full time registered nurses, who are funded by the county's Medical Health Board and then they have several specialist nurses and other professionals physios who come in. We have managed to get the services of a doctor one morning a week, but she will see our kids free at who rooms(ph) at any other time. Odyssey House have a contract with county's Medical District Health Board and they send in three people one morning a week, who deal with students who have identified, who'd been identified as needing help with drug and alcohol issues. And, we have ah… a cops and schools cop two morning a week, he's meant to be there all day, but we can't ever find him. He is a busy boy. 

00:14:30
ROLES OF COUNSELLOR • Liaison with Board, Principal and Leadership Team • Membership of key group within the school, HODs, Aorere Way Committee • Key member of Student Services Team, leads Team meetings • Liaison with statutory and other agencies in the community • Attends all Disciplinary hearings of BOT • Oversight of staff, and Cousellors in Training • Works with Achievers groups • Counselling 

00:14:30
CLAIRE FERGUSSON So, what do I do? I do all of that. Ah… I have a lot to do with the Board of Trustees and the principal and the management of the school. I belong to lots of key groups in the school. As a teacher, I'm pretty comfortable going into the heads of departments meetings. I need to keep up-to-date with what's going on in the academic side of the school particularly getting thrust out of their comfort zone again as NCA(ph) changes. Yet again the requirements of this of(ph) illiteracy or numeracy. I'm the principal link with statutory and other agencies in the community with child, youth and family, spent a lot of time building up a good relationship with the people who work in the child, youth and family offices in our area and that pays to the deans. Also linking with the mental health with the police, with lawyers whatever. When students are in deep trouble and they've done something that the school system can't resolve they must appear at a board hearing and I've been to nearly all of those now for eight years and that's really good, because I build up trust with the board and they can make recommendations for the student, which I then follow through. I look after that of the staff and the counselors, the joy of my life is working in academic groups with some of our high achievers, running homework centers and supporting them and then in bits of time and in between I do some counseling. 

00:16:35
Counselling Approaches • Being prepared to travel out of one's comfort zone • Letting the client know when you are not sure culturally - I'm not sure what your family would think about… • Mitigating harm and strengthening clients to live in their world • Asking questions - what does your family think happens when someone dies? How do people in your church talk to God? • Laughing and crying (at the same time if necessary) • Spirituality - connecting, relating - identifying how client connects and relates with others 

00:16:40
CLAIRE FERGUSSON Now, we are coming to the heart of this, I've just set you the scene, but how do I work with this population of students. Probably 20 odd percent of the students are Samoan, 15% are Maori, 15% are Indian, 10, 12% Tongan(ph), Cook Island ah… a few Pakeha. People from all over the world, who come together in our school and they're there because we've a zone and that's the school they've to go to. So, I couldn't be less like the kids if I tried. I'm old. I've got a go-cart. I'm a pointy nose blue-eyed white lady, who interferes in other peoples' lives. Compared with most of the kids at school I've got a pretty good. I've got a nice house, lovely family, a very vicious cat and yeah a lovely life and I'm going to work every morning crossing the Mangere bridge into another land. So how can these kids come and trust me. Well, first of all when I was first there at some parent meeting. The parents were very, very anti-school counselors particularly nasty pointed nose, white ladies with blue eyes, who told them what to do and quite rightly and people told me what to do when my kids were going through school I was pretty hostile too. So one of the mother said, "Well, what do you do?" And I said, "Well, actually I'm sort of like nana." I'm a old lady and I'm here to fold you in my arms basically all like a big old hen and you all come under my wings. So I've now got about 1600 grandchildren and several thousand honorary children and the parents of the school. And I found this description fitted what I do and most of the kids, I mean if they call me Mrs. Fergusson I would wonder who and (inaudible ) they were talking to that's usually nan out the window while they tried to do, Miss nan I need to see you now. Okay, I'll call for you. So, establishing the persona was really important than being holistic and usually people ah, yes body and mind yeah okay, social yeah(ph). But for the students I work with the critical part of them is the spirituality and this is the area if you neglect at, you might as well leave them in class and how do I become aware of the child's spiritual needs or if they think they have got any. So, I have to be like an alien visiting them and their culture. I have to pretend I've come from mass or an asteroid or something like that and start asking respectful questions. So I've got a student, who has had a death in the family. So, so will, where does your family think uncle Henry is now. You know, if you ask the Pakeha kid there, would say in the cemetery. But the students are likely to say well, he is in heaven now and he is with nana. So you can open up a whole conversation about the really in depth important things that are affecting those people. And yesterday we were privileged to have Cabrini Mcasyale(ph) speaking at the Pacifica Symposium and I learnt much from her and we all know about empathy and sympathy. But she has another term and I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly interpathy like inter pathy and in this we learn a foreign belief and we start to try to base our thinking on that assumption and then we feel the resultant feelings in the foreign context. So, it's a journey of lording(ph) on my part and then I can walk alongside the student through the journey or the parent or the teacher. And my belief is that if you ignore the transcendent you're not being fully there with your client. People get uncomfortable with the idea of spirituality and some people say oh! what you are bottle bashing them and that's so not, so not the aim. Everyone of us is a spiritual being and that doesn't matter if we believe in god or we don't believe in god. To me the spiritual side of us is connectedness. How we connect with people? How we connect with our land? How we connect with nature? And, if we're of a feeling, how we connect with the unseen world? Some people like to express the spirituality through more organized religious practices and that's good. Some of us prefer to express our spirituality in other ways may be through looking after people, through looking after the land. But the connectedness, the joining up. 

00:23:50

00:23:55
CLAIRE FERGUSSON Sometimes the problems that come to me are to do with the family. If the child is in danger or has been harmed in some way, then we have to decide whether to refer on to other agencies for more help for that one. But sometimes it's helping the young person to actually live with what's going on. I'm not a magician. I don't change. I can't change the family structure. I can't change the circumstances. But we can look at ways of may be mitigating the bad things that are happening. Looking for the opportunities rather than the barriers in these situation and helping them to navigate their way through what's happening for them. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:24:55
CLAIRE FERGUSSON I've got laughing and crying at the same time when necessary absolutely, I think I was taught by one place where I worked that it's okay to cry with the client. But they must do 80% of tears and you can only do 20% and that's fair enough. I think, if I am more emotionally over wrote about something than the client then I'm not doing a good job. 

00:25:20

00:25:30
Counselling Approaches • Consulting • with the team • with agencies and other trusted sources • with families as appropriate - students are sometimes surprised that their parents are human:-) understanding and reasonable • Referring on as necessary, but "holding" the client, family and agency • Calling in the invisible team • Love, love and more love 

00:25:30
CLAIRE FERGUSSON This whole approach that we have at our school depends on the teamwork, the trust and the love that is among us. So these are lot of consulting not just from me to other people. But the deans will come into room and say, do you know such and such. Yep… did you know that that boy's mother died last week? No. Often the families are so overwhelmed with what was happening for them that the last thing they think off is to ring up the school so that the database can be updated. Ah… we find out circumstances that kids are going through from a, in a variety of ways really and then it's how to sensitively handle this. But(ph) Henry might not want anyone to know that his mother has died. He might be too overwhelmed, so it's letting him know that if he feels that he needs someone, is someone there. So we consult with agencies, when I'm dealing with students, particularly Pacifica students. The first time this happened to me it quite through me. But I have had some supervision from outside agencies about this. A boy said to me one day, "You know, nan, I don't like being in class at the moment." I said, "Okay, what's up." He said, "Well, my uncle keeps coming through the wall and telling me things." "Oh! so who is this uncle?" "Oh! Well, he died five years ago." So thinking how to deal with that, I consulted the mental health and they said, "Oh! You must refer this boy, he could be psychotic." So, I rang the family and they said, "Oh! No, we are not talking to them." So, rang the mental health back and said, "No, they don't like you." And they said, "Well, it's all yours." So, I thought heavens above. What will I do? How am I going to help this boy to actually be in class and do his work? And not get upset. So, I said to him have you thought of having a chat to your uncle. "Oh! No miss." I said, "Well, how about you ask uncle if he could please only come to see you at home and you make an appointment. So that it is an okay time for you, so you can talk to uncle, find out what he wants to know, tell him you are okay. But only at that time." So I said, you choose the time when you've got ten minutes to spare when you can be in your room, so that your family don't think there is something seriously wrong with you and you can have the chat to uncle. If he comes into class he can talk to him in your head and say sorry uncle I'm in class now remember quarter-to-eight. Now, we got that boys through the rest of his schooling by an unconventional approach, but which restricted his reality and where he felt comfortable. When uncle came around too often he'd come back and see me or the nurse and say hey uncle is hanging around a bit. And we would say right, if you reminded him. "Oh! No if forgot." So, I've worked with many, many students, who in the white western world would be considered to have a problem. But who culturally are experiencing something that's very normal and natural, okay, nan's just passed away, nan's coming round. She is coming around to home to check that Millie(ph) is okay and Millie says, but miss me and my cousins, we were sitting talking to our nan last night. She is really liking being in heaven, because she is with the aunties now. So miss, it's okay isn't it. Yes. Miss are we mental? No darling. You're connecting with your nana and that's beautiful. 

00:30:25
[sil.] 

00:30:30
CLAIRE FERGUSSON Sometimes we need to move our students interconnecting with their families ah… for adolescents, parents are quite strange people, who can't possibly understand you and they're actually quite surprised if we get mum and have a bit of a chat about something that's worrying the young person and then get the young person and they reconnect with mum and they're so surprised that mum actually is a real person and mum loves them. We do refer on but when we refer on to child, youth and family to the mental health people at school we are still the principal people, we still hold the kid, we still hold the family. You know, we are there for them to come and say if they are getting worried by the process or if something else has come up. Ah… for me calling in the invisible team, poor god his ears get quite a battering from me at times, because I saying I'm start (inaudible ) come and help me ah… never lets me down and the other thing that all of our team is that we surround these kids with love, surround each other with love, surround the families with love. 

00:32:10
FITTING IT ALL TOGETHER • We are not at the end of the road, but a work in progress • Constantly changing and evolving • My role has changed too • Less "hands on" counselling • More management and planning 

00:32:10
CLAIRE FERGUSSON So, we're certainly not at the end of the road. We constantly evolving my roles changed, which is really sad, because I have to raise around and buzz people around and I'm not in my little untidy room with my (inaudible ) looking after them. But I think that we're on the road to providing a really good service for our kids. Thank you for your time.
