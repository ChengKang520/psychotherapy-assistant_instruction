MINDFULNESS INFORMED PSYCHOTHERAPY 

00:00:20
RON SIEGEL, PsyD 

00:00:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay, so welcome everybody. You can turn your side as well. And umm… I’d like to begin with a little bit… Well, first a question for you. How many of you are relatively new to mindfulness practice by which I mean, you’ve read books or attended seminars, but you do not have a regular sitting practice. Who does not have a regular sitting practice here? Who does have a regular sitting practice? Okay, excellent. Umm… I’d like to ask also who did not raise their hand for either of those conditions is that because of an irregular sitting practice or often it’s because the mind has already wandered and you’re thinking about, you know, dinner but… Well, welcome. Umm… I… I want to say a little bit about what I meant by Mindfulness Informed Psychotherapy and writing up the description for this session. Uh… Many people think that the integration of mindfulness practices into psychotherapy means teaching your clients to meditate and that is sometimes the case. We call that those of us who’ve been writing and teaching about this, "We call that mindfulness-based treatment" where we actually teach the practice to the person. But Mindfulness Informed Psychotherapy is somewhat broader than that and it really involves using principles that we discover in our own mindfulness practices, principles about how the mind creates suffering and what perpetuate suffering and incorporating those principles into whatever form of psychotherapy we’re doing. Umm… So in this case, Joan, who will… You’ll introduce yourself in a moment umm… has volunteered to uh… to work with us and to help with the demonstration. And she has a chronic pain issues that she’s going to share with us. So umm… so what I’m going to do is give you an idea I happen to work a lot with people with chronic pain disorders and give you an idea of how I would interview somebody with this kind of… kind of issues and then we will do some form of mindfulness practice together and… and see how that goes. But it will be embedded in a much larger context of umm… psychoeducation and as you’ll see I think, you know, a mix of different kinds of therapeutic approaches that all can fit under the rubric of Mindfulness Informed Psychotherapy. Because we’re not talking about teaching meditation to people or certainly not consistently teaching meditation uh… to everybody. Uh… So with that Joan would you like to introduce yourself a little bit to the audience? 

00:03:20
JOAN Hi I’m… I’m Joan. I’m 45. I was diagnosed with RA a year ago, but I’ve suffered with pain my whole life, but I was a dancer. So I always thought that as being a dancer we’re always in pain because we’re dancing all the time and exercising. And I’m a doctor in clinical psychology but currently I’m at home taking care of my two boys who were always also diagnosed with JIA, so it (inaudible). 

00:03:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL So why don’t you tell people what that is? 

00:03:50
JOAN As juvenile idiopathic arthritis umm… so of course I’m being a mother I took that my pain into the… into the back of my mind and just took care of them all the time. And yeah, so I’m here just keeping my license in check, yeah. 

00:04:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay. So… so, we’ll… we’ll let’s… let’s talk about this a little bit. So tell me what your understanding is of your rheumatoid arthritis. What have doctors told you about this? 

00:04:15
JOAN Well, I’m an atypical client in the sense that my blood work doesn’t show the inflammation, but it does show in the MRI. Umm… 

00:04:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL And what did they tell you they saw on the MRI? 

00:04:30
JOAN The synovial fluid umm… is not how it’s supposed to be and so I started to damage my joints in my hands and my feet. 

00:04:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. And did they tell you that the joints that… that now the cartilage or of the structures of the joints or damaged? 

00:04:45
JOAN Not yet. Umm… So I’m taking chemotherapy drugs and other type of medicines that are helping my joints to keep in check. 

00:04:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL It sounds to me, I mean, I’m imagining being in your… your… What… what brought you to go to the doctor in the first place about this? 

00:05:00
JOAN I couldn’t handle it anymore… 

00:05:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Hand sensations. 

00:05:05
JOAN Yeah, the… the pain was so much that I couldn’t handle it. I usually work out a lot because it does help me with pain as (inaudible) in like before. Umm… But now I was beginning to be unbearable. I couldn’t open the door, I couldn’t open the bottle. So I wasn’t functioning and that’s why I went to the doctor. 

00:05:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL And… and where in your body is the pain most… most noticeable? 

00:05:25
JOAN Uh… Well, it difference on the day. Umm… Today its in my hands and my legs. 

00:05:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. 

00:05:30
JOAN My joints. My… my… knees. 

00:05:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL So tends to move around a bit. 

00:05:35
JOAN Depending, yeah. 

00:05:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, I’m imagining, I mean, if I would go to the doctor and have this kind of discomfort and ask "What’s up?" And get an MRI and be told what you’ve been told. I’d imagine having some feelings about that. What… what feelings have you had about this diagnosis? 

00:05:55
JOAN Well, when they said that I had something I was thankful. Because I thought it was making it up in my mind, you know. 

00:06:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Which is itself interesting. If… if I may… if I may take a little aside that… that where… that in some ways is it’s odd, isn’t it? That it might be comforting to hear that something measurable is wrong with my body. 

00:06:15
JOAN Yeah. 

00:06:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL Rather than to think it’s my mind. 

00:06:20
JOAN Yes. 

00:06:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL What is it about that? What do you think it is about knowing it’s something measurable that’s… that’s more comforting than? 

00:06:25
JOAN It gives me more control in the sense that if it’s measurable and peoples… And the doctor says that I have it then there can be a way that we can manage it. And if it’s in my mind then it’s… it’s… it’s a whole process that might be more difficult for me to comprehend, get my… my mind around it, you know. 

00:06:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL It is interesting that trained as a clinical psychologist, you’re more comfortable thinking "Thank God, it’s not something in my field that I have to deal with." 

00:06:50
JOAN Yes, I’m all right. 

00:06:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Because we don’t know what we’re doing, but… but physicians they know what they’re doing so… What a relief there’s something really wrong with my body. 

00:07:00
JOAN Actually it’s because the process is different. Umm… To acknowledge that they are making it up or that you’re actually thinking that you have something that you don’t want involves the process of "Oh, my God! Why am I (inaudible) having all of these things going on do I have the trauma that I haven’t worked out. 

00:07:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Right. 

00:07:20
JOAN And I… I was hoping that… that was not the case. 

00:07:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL Actually because that’s more… that’s more sort of mysterious and it feels like out of our control in some way. 

00:07:25
JOAN Yes. 

00:07:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL And how does the pain influence what you can do in… in your life these days? 

00:07:35
JOAN It does influence the way that I can do my daily activities. Simple things like washing your hair and making this ponytail, this took a long time. Umm… Simple stuff this is more difficult and takes me more time to get them around, yeah. 

00:07:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Can you do everything? It just takes you longer or there’s some things that you’ve given up doing? 

00:07:55
JOAN Umm… I gave up running because running was really hard for my toes and my metatarsal bones. 

00:08:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. 

00:08:00
JOAN So there are some things that I had to stop. I was Flamenco-dancer and I had to stop because of this stumping of the feet on the floor. 

00:08:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Well, what was it like to give up running and give up Flamenco-dancing? 

00:08:10
JOAN Oh, awful… awful. 

00:08:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL You can tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:08:15
JOAN Oh, no, because I’m going to cry. You don’t want me crying here and then all my mascara will be like (inaudible). Oh, no! 

00:08:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL We may have a little problem then? You really don’t want to cry? 

00:08:25
JOAN Oh, no. 

00:08:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL But you want to help with this. I don’t even see… We don’t even have… Oh, we do have tissues. But… 

00:08:35
JOAN (inaudible) you know, it was… it was really hard because it was umm… I’ve been dancing since I was a little girl. Oh, I can’t see its gonna happen. 

00:08:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL No, well, let… let… let… let… let me not push you okay, if you don’t wanna do that. But let me say a little bit about this generally. You know, when we have pain disorders pain is… is… is really complicated. You know, we used to think that the Cartesian model of pain which was that something happens in the periphery of the body and it’s like the way the nerves work is it’s like a rope pulling on a bell and the bell is somehow in our brain and because this happens here we experienced pain here. But what we’ve learned for decades now is that the degree to which we experienced pain is only partially related to what’s happening in the peripheral nervous system that if umm… we would, I mean, you’ve got, you know, rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, but if what you had was experimentally induced pain where we used a laser or an electric shock or something where we could make it consistent sometimes it would hurt a lot more than other times. And one of the things that would… would change how much it hurts. Would be our attitude toward it, our belief about it and what other emotions are connected with it. So that’s where when people have been suffering with some kind of pain problem and there’s a whole well of emotions that kind of get pushed aside, they start to be relevant to umm… to being able to work with it. And interestingly one of the things that happens to people is that when there’s umm… when there’s pain and when there’s loss associated with that pain and a lot of feelings about that… that we’ve pushed out of our awareness what the body does to try to not feel is it tightens up, it tenses. And one of the things that we’ve learned quite consistently is any pain syndrome is made much worse when the body gets tense and then when the body is relaxed. And oftentimes is precisely when we connect with the tears around it that… that… that tension and we don’t know what percentage of the discomfort might be due to that extra layer of… of tension and resistance that happens around whatever’s going on in the joints, but that’s why it might make sense to move toward the feeling. But you gotta decide you want to talk about it and risk the mascara. 

00:11:10
JOAN Oh, yeah… yeah. Let’s go for it. 

00:11:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL So… so tell me a little… So… so understanding that’s why we’re doing it not just to make you miserable. Umm… What… Yeah, tell me what it was like to give up running and Flamenco-dancing? 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:30
JOAN Nobody has asked that. 

00:11:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL I’m bringing you the tissues here. 

00:11:40
JOAN The thing is that nobody has asked that so is the first step that I’m talking about this. 

00:11:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. All right. While you’re among a few friends. 

00:11:50
JOAN Just a few Ph. Ds and scientists, I’m good. Umm… It was hard because it has been part of my life forever. 

00:12:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:12:00
JOAN Yeah. And… and running I don’t know people run here or do exercise is a way of dealing with stress. And the endorphins that you get from running are… are great, right? So it was a way also of dealing with pain, so it… that may not make sense, but… 

00:12:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL It not makes perfect sense. I use it for the same reasons myself. 

00:12:25
JOAN So umm… it was like taking out a skill that I had or a clutch and taking it out and saying "Okay, so umm… you cannot run because you’re damaging your… your knees," but while you are doing to work with the pain you cannot doing that anymore. 

00:12:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yes, it is. 

00:12:40
JOAN So that was hard. 

00:12:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, that’s great. 

00:12:45
JOAN Yeah. 

00:12:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL And… and I imagined scary feeling like "Oh, my God! Then it’s just going to be worse and… worse and… worse because the thing I can rely on to help, I can’t rely on. 

00:12:55
JOAN I am… I am like a swimmer so I just want like "Okay, what then what’s next." 

00:13:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL So you that. 

00:13:00
JOAN So that’s why I ne6ver give myself time to do this. Because I’ve always "Okay, then how am I going to fix it." 

00:13:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, but… 

00:13:05
JOAN What am I gonna do now. 

00:13:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL But it may be useful to take some more time to do… to do this. 

00:13:05
JOAN Oh, yeah. 

00:13:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL So how did it feel to run? 

00:13:15
JOAN Oh, I love that. 

00:13:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Tell me about it? 

00:13:15
JOAN The first two miles are awful and I… and I always go like "Why am I running, I hate this," you know, but then when you hit that two miles and a half or three miles I can keep on running until I don’t know it’s like a tired. 

00:13:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, I don’t know if this is part of your experience for me. There’s a way in which I don’t feel like I’m gonna get old and die when I’m running. 

00:13:35
JOAN Yes… yes. 

00:13:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL You know it feels like the body is just like the machine works… 

00:13:45
JOAN Yes, of course when you’re in the 13 miles you go like "Oh my God! I’m dying." 

00:13:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, right, but… but… but short of that. 

00:13:50
JOAN And then it goes away again. 

00:13:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Right. 

00:13:50
JOAN But yeah… yeah… 

00:13:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL But if we’re talking about the three mile or four mile of marks the body functioning that way… 

00:14:00
JOAN I was Wonder Woman. I was yeah. 

00:14:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah… yeah, now that’s a lot to give up. 

00:14:05
JOAN Oh, yeah. 

00:14:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, and… and what was flamenco dancing like for you? 

00:14:10
JOAN Oh, it was part of connecting with my heritage. 

00:14:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. 

00:14:15
JOAN I was born in Puerto Rico, but my family’s from Spain so I always thought different from everybody else. But when I does flamenco I was home. 

00:14:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, so you really miss that. 

00:14:25
JOAN Yes. 

00:14:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL There’s… I’m… I’m guessing again now and uh… does it feel like it’s too early to be giving this things up? 

00:14:40
JOAN Yes. 

00:14:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah. And (inaudible) stuff I think while (inaudible) someday I’ll be really old and have to give this stuff up way. 

00:14:50
JOAN Yeah. 

00:14:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Why now… 

00:14:50
JOAN Yeah, I keep pushing it though umm… I kept on dancing even though I was in pain until I just couldn’t. 

00:15:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Until the pain was just too bad. Now that’s… It’s… it’s hard. And… and… and what is the if… if you can close your eyes right now just for a moment and just… just be with the… the sort of the grief that you feel about having given up running and about having given up Flamenco dancing, and just breathe with that and just see what that feels like in the body that… that sadness? 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Can you describe where you feel that? 

00:15:45
JOAN Umm… It’s just like isolation somehow. 

00:15:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. So says "You connect with it in the body there’s a sense of feeling isolated? 

00:15:50
JOAN Yeah, like I lost like when you’re by yourself and yeah, this is the way that it feels. 

00:16:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, so that there’s a way that may be running and… and dancing connected you to the world or connected you… 

00:16:05
JOAN Yes. 

00:16:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL In some way and you’re… you’re cut off now? 

00:16:10
JOAN Yes. 

00:16:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL So stay with it a little bit more see what… see what else arises there what else? Where else it feels like in the body just to be… to be missing these things? 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:40
JOAN Sensations in the body it’s difficult to pinpoint. 

00:16:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Well, maybe there are many sensations happening? 

00:16:55
JOAN Yes, maybe. 

00:16:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL Just see whatever… whatever you notice? 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL What the sadness feels like perhaps or if there are other feelings that are showing up in the body? 

00:17:10
[sil.] 

00:17:15
JOAN The feelings of frustration… 

00:17:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. 

00:17:20
JOAN And anger. 

00:17:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL Maybe speak from those a little bit. What… what does it feel like? What has you frustrated, I mean, what about this is most frustrating or most angering? 

00:17:40
JOAN Having the willingness to do it and not being able to do them, you know. 

00:17:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, it so not your choice right? 

00:17:45
JOAN No. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:55
JOAN But also something just happened now is that umm… I had a lot of pain in my neck and it’s not that bad as before. So I don’t know if it has to do with… 

00:18:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Shifted a little bit. 

00:18:10
JOAN Yeah. 

00:18:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Well, you know, sometimes when there’s a lot of feeling we’re holding back, you know, (inaudible) this is psychologists, you know, we’ll have rife before he went insane, you know, he… he had some smart things to say about character armor and about the way in which the way we defend against feelings is by tightening the body. 

00:18:35
JOAN Yes… yes. 

00:18:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL And it’s quite… it’s quite automatic and quite unconscious. And sometimes when we connect to the feeling, then the body opens up. Sometimes it works the other way if you open up the body, you connect to the feeling. 

00:18:45
JOAN Yeah. 

00:18:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL But they… they go hand in hand. 

00:18:50
JOAN Yeah, also of course when I say anger, I felt my heartbeat tighten like go quicker, but I go back to say "No, it’s okay, you know, it’s part of me." 

00:19:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Go… go with the being pissed off a little bit. Just… just… just with the feelings what I… I know… I know anger in these situations is tricky because like who or what to be angry up but… but what… what comes up. What do you notice? 

00:19:15
JOAN Yes, I was… I was angry at having this illness. 

00:19:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:19:20
JOAN Uh… I can’t tell… 

00:19:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, well, that’s got to be another huge thing, so tell me about those feelings? 

00:19:25
JOAN Those are worse at this. 

00:19:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah 

00:19:30
JOAN Yeah. Umm… They are home-school, they are home bound. They cannot go to school… 

00:19:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Oh, really. 

00:19:35
JOAN They’re very intelligent. They cannot, you know, handle the stress of being at school, the fatigue that comes with it. And then they look… 

00:19:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. 

00:19:50
JOAN Just like me. If you see me you will never say "She’s in pain," you know, and it’s umm… So my kids are just like that they’re very umm… go-getters and they try everything but you can see what they cannot climb the stairs, how they go and they used their… their arms. 

00:20:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL And you see them struggling. 

00:20:15
JOAN Yeah, that’s hard. 

00:20:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Sure. 

00:20:15
JOAN Yeah, so I’m angry about that too. 

00:20:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, of course. Have… have they had to give up. I mean, it sounds like they’ve given up going to school for… 

00:20:25
JOAN Yes, the oldest one is… is trying to go because his senior year and the other one has not been in high school, so he has missed or high school. Umm… They both were swimmers and they did karate. They can’t anymore and umm… extracurricular activities. They have… they’re not able to go because, I mean, they’re after school and with arthritis, yeah, stiffness in the morning. But as the day goes along then you have the fatigue, so they don’t have the energy to go to acquire. They used to sing, have beautiful voices. Both used to play the guitar, they can’t anymore. 

00:21:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL What have the doctors told you the mechanism there? What… what… what… what have they describe they’ve… they’ve seen? 

00:21:15
JOAN Well, we got genetic testing because we needed to find out because my niece also suffers from the same condition and my sister. And so we have this… this mutation so I’m a mutant. Umm… As Mediterranean Fever and also all of the other autoimmune things coming up and that mixture of (inaudible) then has developing all of the symptoms. 

00:21:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Mm-hmm. Wow! 

00:21:50
JOAN Yeah, I know. So you get like big beautiful eyes and Creaky Joints. 

00:22:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL And your heart must break for your kids… right? 

00:22:00
JOAN Yes… yes. 

00:22:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Well, so working with this is, I mean, there’s a lot of different aspects to it, right? There… there’s the… there’s working with the grief. 

00:22:15
JOAN Yes. 

00:22:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL And heartache there’s working on the practical level of what can you do with your kid, for your kids, their grief and their heartache, I don’t know, do they talk about this with you is this? 

00:22:25
JOAN No. 

00:22:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, so they probably have or perhaps have their own equivalent of all the frustration, and anger and grief that they’re not talking about either umm… which is probably affecting them in some kind of way. And then there’s the other level of how to work with the moment-to-moment pain sensations. Umm… Now what had the doctors told you about whether it’s dangerous or not for you to use your body normally? 

00:23:05
JOAN Well, this is the thing that uh… you can and there some things that might make your joints worse like high impact activities, but low impact activities like swimming, walking, (inaudible) umm… you know, all of these type of things, yes, you can do and it’s good for you to actually move. 

00:23:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL Right. 

00:23:30
JOAN Umm… That’s why if you have seen me I… I usually stand up every 30 minutes and I stretch and I walk even if it hurts. Because it’s kinda make me feel better. 

00:23:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Right and you’ve already discovered that in your own experience that moving… 

00:23:40
JOAN Oh, yes. 

00:23:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Is much help… Is much more helpful than just staying still? 

00:23:45
JOAN I became a fitness instructor after receiving the… the diagnosis just because I wanted to keep on moving. 

00:23:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL Right… right and… and have you had any experiences with mindfulness practices. Have you done any of this kind of thing that before? 

00:24:00
JOAN Umm… I have for my own umm… but I’ve never used it with my patients before when I had my… my private practice. 

00:24:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. But you’ve done it just as a personal practice. 

00:24:15
JOAN For me? Yeah. 

00:24:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. So let’s… let’s… let’s experiment a little bit together in part… in part because we’re doing a demonstration on this. I’m not sure if we would do this if you actually came into my office just with what you’re telling me because. I think I must stay with how hard this is emotionally because it’s really hard emotionally. 

00:24:35
JOAN I know. You think, yeah, it’s true, it is. That’s… that’s validating to hear you say that. 

00:24:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL And… and, you know, like all losses there were morning processes and they, you know, we never know the pace or how… how that’s all gonna go? But maybe this will also be useful to you as well to move umm… Mick, okay, I’m hearing a lot of echo is it… Oh, you’re trying to help us with that. Okay, thank you. Umm… So allow yourself to close your eyes again. 

00:25:05
JOAN Okay. 

00:25:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL And let’s just start by paying attention to the sensations of the breath. Just allowing yourself to breathe normally. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL You notice the sensations both of the in-breath and out-breath. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL And see if you can cultivate a little continuity of awareness to stay with the sensations of the breath from the beginning of the in-breath to the end of the out-breath, and then on to the next. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL And it would not be unusual for thoughts to enter the mind that’s okay. There are friends, but instead of following each thought as we might ordinarily do. Let’s instead simply allow the thoughts that come and go, bringing the attention back to the sensations of the breath. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:27:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL And as you’re doing this with your eyes closed and keep noticing the breath but give me a little bit of a status report just tell me whatever you’re noticing as you… as you do this whatever is occurring? 

00:27:25
JOAN Some thoughts of the emotions that I had before came back. 

00:27:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL Sure. 

00:27:30
JOAN And I felt emotional again but I just won back to paying attention to my breathing. 

00:27:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay. 

00:27:40
JOAN And they went away. 

00:27:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL And that’s okay. And… and part of what we’re gonna do is allow thoughts that have emotions connected to them to come and go. So let’s stay with the breath a little bit longer allowing whatever arises to come and go. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL And let’s… let’s approach this with an attitude of kind of interest or curiosity to see what happens as we gradually incline our attention out of the stream of thought toward the moment-to-moment sensations in the body with each breath. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:29:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL And next what I’d like to invite you to do is notice if there’s any discomfort anywhere in the body. Let the breath be a little bit more in the background and just scan and see if there’s any discomfort anywhere? And if there is, let me know what you’re noticing and what that feels like? 

00:29:25
JOAN I have pain in my… in my index finger and in my jaw right now. I just noticed that my jaw was hurting. 

00:29:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay, and if… if you can notice which one is stronger the index finger or… or your toe? 

00:29:45
JOAN Umm… Like jaw and my finger. 

00:29:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Oh! I’m sorry did you say jaw? 

00:29:45
JOAN Yeah. 

00:29:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL I’m sorry miss heard jaw, okay. Just allow yourself to feel the discomfort in your jaw and your index finger, and keep breathing with that and see if one or another of the sensations becomes predominant, feel stronger. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:15
JOAN Yes. 

00:30:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Which is it? 

00:30:20
JOAN The jaw. 

00:30:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL The jaw. Okay, so then let the breath be in the background a little bit and let’s let the sensations in the jaw be the object of your attention. To simply notice them and allow them to be there. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Basically feel the jaw sensations. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:31:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL And see if you can notice the jaw sensations in as much detail as is possible comfortably. As though you’re really kind of interested and curious in the moment-to-moment sensory experience of what’s going on in the jaw. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL And again if you would leaving your eyes closed, let me know what you’re noticing? 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:00
JOAN Umm… I… I can visualize where the pain is coming in… in the joint of the jaw. Let us I think about it more profoundly, the pain is there but it doesn’t hurt as much, I don’t know, how to describe it but the pain is there still but is not bothering me. 

00:32:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay, so… so this both sort of an image that comes up about if I hear you correctly about where… where it’s located. But as you bring your attention to it… 

00:32:30
JOAN Yeah. 

00:32:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL It’s not as disturbing. 

00:32:30
JOAN Mm-hmm. 

00:32:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay, so let’s… let’s just keep attending to it as an object of awareness. Again with the kind of interest or curiosity like attending to it the way we might listen to music, seeing if it changes a little from moment-to-moment. Seeing all the different notes that maybe go into the chords of sensation and just allow yourself to breathe in the background, as you attend to the sensations in the jaw. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL And again let me notice… let me know what you notice including if any feelings or thoughts or images are also surfacing. 

00:34:05
JOAN Yeah, a feeling of calmness. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL The sensations in the jaw they’re changing in any way? 

00:34:30
JOAN Uh… The pain is still there but it’s not as acute as before. 

00:34:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay. 

00:34:35
JOAN And the image that came to me as like waves from the ocean that are coming but they’re not as high tide as before. 

00:34:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL I see. 

00:34:45
JOAN So I see the pain going like this lower motion. 

00:34:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. Coming and does it have sort of a wave-like form to it? 

00:34:50
JOAN Yes. 

00:34:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay, so let’s just ride the wave of the pain a little bit. Just allow each wave to… each wave of sensation to come to crest, to recede and come and crest and recede, as though it weren’t a problem. 

00:35:15
[sil.] 

00:35:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL As though it were okay for these sensations to be there. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL And just to… to serve approach this from another angle as well. Can you imagine a person or a being or somebody who’s naturally loving in-kind. Holding you right now as you’re in the pain? As you’re with the pain sensations or just holding your hand or in some way comforting you. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL And just let me know what happens when you… when you see if that comes to mind are not? 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:55
JOAN It’s hard to imagine that because I usually… 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Because you usually… 

00:37:10
JOAN I don’t like people taking care of me. 

00:37:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL And you do this all on your own, yeah. 

00:37:15
JOAN So I couldn’t imagine anyone. 

00:37:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:37:15
JOAN I held myself. 

00:37:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, I think… I think I had a little intuition about that which is, yeah, so that… so that doesn’t happen so easily. 

00:37:25
JOAN Yeah. 

00:37:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Okay, and let’s just come back to the breath for another… for another few moments. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL And then when you’re ready you can open your eyes again come more back into the room. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:10
JOAN No, mascara running. Do I look good? I need comedy because life is… 

00:38:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL I know of course… of course as I just gotta say I’ve never been very good with makeup. So I… You know, so… so what’s your… Tell me your uh… tell me your thoughts and reflections on what we’ve discussed so far and on doing that little practice of being with the pain. 

00:38:40
JOAN It was really interesting umm… I have jaw pain too which is that it’s not as bad as the other ones. Umm… But yeah, it was really interesting how the pain was there, but it wasn’t bothering me. 

00:38:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:38:55
JOAN And that is something that I have done before when I’m in… in a lot of pain, but this time I was able to reach it faster… 

00:39:05
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. 

00:39:05
JOAN You know, than other times that I have to be like "Okay, I need to concentrate and really think about it, so that it doesn’t hurt," but the way that we did it umm… I wished it faster than when I am by myself. 

00:39:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL And… and it’s tricky when we… when we take this approach because sort of if we’re taking the approach of being with the pain in order to get it to stop. 

00:39:25
JOAN Yeah. 

00:39:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL That tends not to work. That’s a little bit like umm… I’m gonna not think about falling asleep so I can fall asleep and I have insomnia. 

00:39:35
JOAN Yeah. 

00:39:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL You know, it tends to backfire on us or… 

00:39:35
JOAN Yeah. 

00:39:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL You may not have had this experience not being a guy, but you know, I’m not going to worry about getting an erection or not may not be guaranteed to have one, you know, which is the other uh… besides insomnia guaranteed way if you try to control it. It doesn’t work out well. Umm… So with these kinds of practices, it’s a matter of really kind of just sort of trusting that if we move toward the pain with the kind of openness that umm… that it’ll be okay in some… in some sense. Umm… And… and we do start to see umm… The Buddha talked about this 2,500 years ago. I… I mentioned this in one of the other workshops that… that, you know, when we are… when we have physical pain umm… it’s like being shot by an arrow, but what we often do is we then add this other arrow on top of it of all of that I hate it and as well as all the meanings it has cause I’m imagining every time that you have one of these painful experiences it brings up all the meaning of "Oh my God! The arrow is getting worse. Now it’s in this part of my body or that part of my body." Uh… At least this part of your experience to worry about it? 

00:40:55
JOAN No. 

00:40:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL Not so much. 

00:40:55
JOAN So many things are going on that I don’t get time to stop and think about it. 

00:41:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL We come from different ethnicities that way. For my… my ethnicity it will be like I’m stop worrying about… 

00:41:10
JOAN No… no. I uh… know because I’ve had pain all my life. So pain is part of my life, so I don’t go like "Oh! This has happened it’s like "Oh, well," you know. 

00:41:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL I see so you… you do tend to. So that well, that’s nice that you don’t have that whole other overlay because that can be hard. Umm… But one of the things that you could do is experimenting with when it is more intense to see if you can just… if… if you can notice the… the sort of the difference between feeling it and hating it. 

00:41:45
JOAN Yes. 

00:41:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Umm… And it’s not that we’re trying to make the hating stop either, but if we can see the hating as its own phenomenon that’s what the Buddha called the second arrow he said, you know, it’s… it’s like right after shooting us with the arrow of pain we’re shot with this other one, which is all of the struggle against it. And sometimes when we can actually just sort of feel noticed that struggle if it comes up, then that… that makes it we identify with less, it becomes less umm… less intends for us and we’re able to be with it more. And most pain sensations when we can be with them create less suffering than when we’re trying desperately to make them stop. 

00:42:30
JOAN Yeah, go way. 

00:42:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, and, you know, I work with chronic pain a lot and you’re already oriented in a way which is extremely useful because most people when they have a lot of… When they have pain sensations, they start giving up activities willy-nilly, you know, they… they… they try to "Well, I’m not gonna do this, I’m not gonna do that." And it sounds like you’re trying to hang in there. 

00:42:50
JOAN Oh, no, I don’t mind… 

00:42:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL As… as much as possible unless the evidence is overwhelming that this isn’t gonna work from me. 

00:42:55
JOAN Yeah. 

00:43:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Umm… And that is extremely helpful for, you know, for not getting into one of these pain, fear pain syndromes that… that… that happens to people. Umm… It’s… it’s just the other part of it that probably could use some attention and would probably let you feel better is if you could let the tears come and dare I say even trust somebody to comfort you in this. 

00:43:25
JOAN Sure. It’s something that I… I’ve never touch on is what the feelings behind all this. 

00:43:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, and because you know all of us when we’re in physical pain we, you know, when you’re little and… and your skin your knee is like we’re kinda frozen until a parent comes and, you know, or somebody… somebody comes and hugs us and communicates "I’m here for you sweetheart," and that both releases all the emotion, but it also allows us to relax around… around… around what’s happened. 

00:44:05
JOAN Yeah. 

00:44:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL So that… that might be part of the path through this I’m thinking. 

00:44:10
JOAN Make sense. 

00:44:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Do you have thoughts or questions for me about sort of what we’ve done here? 

00:44:20
JOAN No, but I’m very thankful because you open a whole thing that I never thought out, you know. 

00:44:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, okay. I’m… I’m glad that, I mean, all I did was ask a little bit… 

00:44:30
JOAN I know. 

00:44:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL You’re right there with it, but thank you for that. Umm… Would be okay if we turned to the audience and… and kinda say… see what their… what their thoughts are about… about this? 

00:44:40
JOAN Yeah. 

00:44:40
RONALD D. SIEGEL Well, yeah, please let’s thank you, Joan for doing this. 

00:44:45
JOAN Shall I go? 

00:44:45
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, just… 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL So, you know, reflections, thoughts ideas, about other ways to approach this. 

00:45:05
[sil.] 

00:45:10
JOAN (inaudible). 

00:45:15
[sil.] 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Thank you for that I… I really curious about to use metaphor… 

00:45:25
RONALD D. SIEGEL Just hold… hold the mike a little closer. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Use a metaphor when you were speaking and leading the guided inquiry. Umm… Like that one I particularly love was the one about the notes making the chord of sensation. 

00:45:35
RONALD D. SIEGEL Uh-huh. 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN And I wondered about using metaphor in mindfulness based therapy as it’s not something I’ve seen much of before. 

00:45:50
RONALD D. SIEGEL You know, umm… when we’re incorporating what we know from mindfulness practices into psychotherapy. We’re not letting go of anything else we know about psychotherapy from whatever way we’ve worked or learned or whatever’s been useful before and umm… you know, clearly one of the… one of the things that happens in almost all therapies is helping people to have some way to give voice to their experience. And there’s kind of two ways that goes. One way is by just soliciting it in a kind of Rogerian way and there’s a lot of value and power to that. And the other one is to allow the therapists if the therapist has had a bunch of experience with people with somewhat similar circumstances, sometimes offering a guess as long as it’s framed tentatively, it’s helpful. Like in… in this case that image of, you know, of the chord umm… like I’ve spent a lot of time paying attention to pain in this body and talking to people about pain in their bodies and pain is very interesting that way, it is kinda like a chord, you know, there’s so many different sensations and so it just popped into my head and I said it thinking I wonder if that would be helpful for Joan to umm… identify clearly and put some words to what was happening. Umm… But it’s… it’s I didn’t think of it as a plan full method like "Oh, you know, I’m going to do the metaphor method." It… it was more just a thought. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Are you kind of answered my question. 

00:47:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL I’m sorry. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Over here… over here. 

00:47:30
RONALD D. SIEGEL Who’s got the mike, thank you? 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN You kind of answered my question which was to give us an idea of the thinking and feeling process that you went through as you guided her through that uh… so that’s my question but my comment is to thank you, Joan for the demonstration I also have RA and my hips had been giving me a fit this whole trip just because I think the changing climate. And so I really thank you for that because for the first time since I got here my hips hurt less. Thank you. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL You know, I… I want to say something a little bit more about my thinking process to… to tell the truth. 

00:48:10
JOAN Yeah. 

00:48:15
RONALD D. SIEGEL Umm… A lot of my work is with psychophysiological disorders umm… which… which really refers to the ways in which certain mental patterns or attitudes can affect the function of organ systems. And psychophysiological processes sometimes with somebody’s got to disorder is just psychophysiological and if we help the person to work with like a lot of back pain, for example, is its muscle tension and you help a person to understand that and work with it differently and the thinking let go entirely and it’s like no disorder. Of course, a lot of times things are complicated and there’s some kind of mix of medical event going on and how the mind responds to it. And there part of my process was to try to… to try to find the right balance with this, to not want to in any way invalidate the fact that, you know, you have this upsetting diagnosis, you know, which you’re having to deal with, but also offered the possibility that through understanding it psychologically and working with the different feelings that there might be a way to work with the sensations of the diagnosis that makes for less suffering. And… and it is a tricky needle to thread I find in… in… in this kind of you’ve been extremely gracious and so easy to work with, it hasn’t been tricky with you, but often in clinical practice it’s tricky because it’s very easy to offend people by beginning to work with the psychological dimensions of something because it feels like it’s invalidating the medical diagnosis. Now sometimes I work a lot with tension related back pain disorders, sometimes there I kinda do one invalidate the… the diagnosis and help them to see an… an alternative explanation that could account for their difficulty because it might… it might actually lead to freedom and I’ve seen it often lead people to freedom. But so each… each situation is… is different and, you know, uh… not being a rheumatologist I don’t also know all the varieties of RA and so it I just want to say my thought process also involves this kind of balancing uh… since… since you had asked about that. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Hi, thank you very much that was really lovely and… and the compassion and empathy that you demonstrated was strongly felt. And so my question is this umm… I practice at rational emotive behavior therapy you’re familiar with it and frankly what I observed could have been rational emotive behavior therapy there was the cognitive… there was psychoeducational, there was paying attention to the emotion, there was feeling the emotion and empathy ripple. And so I would really appreciate understanding what suits your approach aside if anything from the holistic approach your rational emotive behavior therapy this third wave is what your approach seems to be called in. I’m not seeing what sits the patent I’d (inaudible). 

00:51:20
RONALD D. SIEGEL Perhaps not much umm… but I will say that having done a lot of mindfulness practice myself in forms a lot what I find myself doing as a therapist. Uh… That doesn’t mean that I might not come to a very similar pathway to somebody who has not done a lot of mindfulness practice themselves to do it. But there’s a certain relationship to experience including just to name a few principles that any time there’s an attempt to resist a mental content suffering is increased, having observed that over and over and there are the schools of therapy who come to that conclusion as well and Albert Ellis was, you know, uh… among people who would certainly umm… you know, he didn’t seem real inhibited, right? You know. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN Not too much. 

00:52:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Umm… And so there… there are many pathways to that, but my own way of coming to see that happens to have been through mindfulness practice. Other dimensions that we didn’t get into here because it… it just wasn’t germane to this is the understanding of what a self is, is influenced by mindfulness practice. When one does a lot of mindfulness practice, one starts to identify… not identify with this psychophysiology so much with the narrative about me and believing in Ron being this way or Ron being that way. But experiencing what we might call multiple selves or constantly transforming and changing self states, uh… so there’s a sort of looseness around that. And if we were working with a problem that had more to do with a person feeling badly about themselves that might have come… become apparent there. Umm… In other aspect is that when we shift into mindfulness-based treatment, we do use the fact that one can train the mind to develop concentration and can use the tool of concentration to investigate. It becomes like a beacon that can be pointed to different phenomenon that’s happening in the mind and the body, and… and the techniques of mind training that are part of mindfulness traditions can become part of treatment, as can umm… practices I… I just touched on it in the most the general way by coming up with the image of somebody holding your hand or hugging you or something, but there are many formal self compassion and loving kindness practices and stuff. Now have some research data behind them, they’re really about importing D. W. Winnicott into the room or for that matter Mr. Rogers uh… and… 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN Or Albert Ellis. 

00:53:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL Or Albert Ellis, yeah, although he could be a cantankerous loving father, but umm… but nonetheless as I understand it. I… I never met him. Umm… So all this… those are the dimensions could take a part in it also. But frankly I don’t think in Mindfulness Oriented Psychotherapy as other than other psychotherapies. I might propose that some of the processes that happen in mindfulness practice, the ability to be with experience not… not be controlling it so much, allowing it to be, not identifying with narratives, not identifying with a particular sense of self, those may be healing elements in a very wide range of treatments so that if people from a lot of different orientations hear about mindfulness practice or… or take it up or see it down and say "That reminds me a lot about what works in my tradition." I think, yeah, good we’re identifying some common factors here that are useful and we’ve also got some… some tools that come out of mindfulness traditions that are helpful for cultivating some of those umm… common factors. 

00:55:05
[sil.] 

00:55:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yes! 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN While it was an extraordinary… 

00:55:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL Just… just hold the mike little closer. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN While it was an extraordinary demonstration and I salute you. For me this was a… a class on resilience. It was a class about an indomitable woman with an unwavering spirit, unquenchable spirit that has for me all the definitions of what I call resilient, the three Cs that I used in one of my dissertations. You have to see that you can look at life as a challenge, as opposed to a threat, you’re committed and involved with your life and somehow or another you take charge and control of what you can. And I truly salute you. I think it’s extraordinary and what lucky children. What… what extraordinary children to have you as a role model and I think we should (inaudible) and if you don’t even believe in God or higher power. I do believe in the power of prayer and I think we all should just pray for you and your family. I think it’s extraordinary what you are doing. It… it… it took my breath away and I think you. 

00:56:25
JOAN Thank you. 

00:56:30

RONALD D. SIEGEL Thank you for that. It’s a… And I just to add, you know, people are talking a lot these days about posttraumatic growth, you know, how one can, you know, what lessons we can learn when these things happen. And, you know, I just eyes to dovetail with what you’re saying, you know, just see you, looking for the lessons in it, you know. 

00:56:55
JOAN Yes. 

00:57:00
RONALD D. SIEGEL Including even in this moment of connecting to, you know, some more vulnerable feelings around it and think and reacting with the sense of "Oh, yeah, there might be something useful here…" 

00:57:10
JOAN Oh, yeah, always. 

00:57:10
RONALD D. SIEGEL To… to connect into that and… and that’s another critical part of resilience. Thank you. So we have time maybe for one more comment or question.

UNKNOWN Umm… So I was wondering you had mentioned that umm… if you had her as your own client that possibly you wouldn’t have gone into this umm… demo like you would in session in the room with her. How… how often would you use mindfulness or how often do you use it with your clients and for what duration how would you close out a session like this and began it? 

00:57:55
RONALD D. SIEGEL Yeah, I probably only actually teach like a mindfulness meditation to I’m gonna say maybe 20% of the people I work with, which I know that sometimes surprises people because I’m always, you know, talking to a therapist about it. Umm… I’m happy teaching to every therapist I work with. I think it’s really important for us, but… but the (inaudible) has to be kinda interested umm… or… or I have to have a sense that they might be. But the insights from mindfulness practice including just how we talk about things or for the person had pain even if I never touched the breath, I would still stay with, so what exactly does it feel like? So we would be doing practices but not something that look like meditation uh… for… for many people and I frankly haven’t figured out what makes me feel more comfortable teaching it to some people than others, I mean, sometimes it’s obvious, you know, they’re… they have new age interests or they call me up because "Hey, I hear you know about this stuff I’m into mindfulness… Then it’s easy. But for… for normal people, you know, who… who just have a problem and they approach be clinically, it’s… it’s a little not exactly sure, I mean, there are some guidelines. People who have a lot of unresolved trauma for instance, I don’t go near, you know, meditation practices where you would the… the core of the body because it’s… it’s… there’s too much (inaudible) repression happens and it’s… it’s going to open up umm… too much. But with somebody like that I might do an externally focused mindfulness practice of… of, you know, let’s look out the window together and just bring the attention there so, but I wouldn’t do something that looks like formal meditation uh… with somebody like that although even there I have a long-time patient who has a terrible trauma history, who I get this sometimes, you know, they come across me on the web or something even after they’ve worked with me for a decade and they say "Hey, you haven’t told the stuff I see your name everywhere. How come you don’t teach me?" Well, that actually comes up, then I’ll usually say "Oh, you want too?" You know, and… and we’ll do it even if it’s somebody that I’ve been skittish about. And sometimes I’ll tell him "Well, I’ve been skittish about it because I’m afraid it may bring up too much of those memories that you have trouble with, but if you want to try we can do it. But we just got to be careful, it may bring up the memories." So it’s… it’s a… it’s a variable thing. So thank you, everybody for coming and… and Thank you Joan… really it’s a… Thank you for… for being this vulnerable and true with everybody.
