 ... equally important in the field of psychotherapy and the field of psychology in general. Uhm, Martin Seligman has been a great friend of the Erickson Foundation and he's going to be, uhm, talking with us, ah, about prospective posi-- ah, Positive Psychology and Prospection. Ah, having his conversation hour, I know that you're in for a remarkable treat and what he is bringing into the warp and woof of psychology and psychotherapy is going to be very important for us to understand, very important for us to incorporate. Not only incorporate into our practice but also incorporate into our everyday life. Positive psychology is something that, ah, Marty Seligman has been formulating, he's inventing positive psychology, bringing psycholo-- positive psychology into a way that it can be understood, into a way that it can use in the military and as a way of cutting down on some of the problems that's been happening in the military, in business, in, in life. Now, after Marty's speech and, of course, we'll give him a full hour in which to, ah, teach us about his latest state of the art work then for those of you who wish to stay around, we will have some closing remarks. Traditionally, what we've done for closing remarks is we've ask the faculty first to come to the microphone and give their reflections and then any of the attendees who care to, to come to the microphone and give their reflections. It's purely optional as to whether or not you take this moment to, ah, uhm, join us for the closing remarks but we welcome you to do so. So please, ah, with equally great enthusiasm, welcome Marty Seligman.

MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN As psychotherapy evolves, ah, I want to later suggest two figure ground reversals. My talk is divided in half. Uhm, the first figure ground reversal is suffering unhappiness and I think the figure for 120 years has been misery and suffering and our job has been to relieve and I'm going to suggest today that what was in the background, the building of wellbeing, the building of positivity is a reason to think that ground might well become figure. The second thing I wanna suggest is that the-- for very interesting historical reasons, the figure in psychotherapy, in psychology generally has been the past and the present. The ground has been the future, ah, and I wanna suggest that there's another evolution coming that, that figure will become the way we think about the future. Uhm, truth in advertising, uhm, I'm a more and more a fish out of water at this great meeting. Ah, I don't do psychotherapy anymore, ah, I think primarily about, ah, the physical health and basic theory and the application of psychological principles to the world. But I think I might today have suggestions for you that may be useful for psychotherapy. One having to do with the positive and one having to do with Homo Prospectus rather than Homo Sapiens.

MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, so let me outline what I intend to do over the next hour. Uhm, I'm gonna suggest to you that, that we've been handicapped by misguided myopic theorizing in the history of psychology and psychotherapy has been burdened with this and, and ha-- hasn't been crippled because I think clinicians always knew that the positive was important. They always knew that the future was important, so clinical wisdom has prevented being crippled by bad theoretical premises. But I think when we uncover those premises and reverse them, psychotherapy may become better. Ah, So the two lacunae I wanna talk about today are the place of the positive in human life and place of, ah, thinking about the future in human life and the independence of the positve from the negative and the independence of the future from the past and the present. Ah, so let me begin by talking about, ah, ah, wellbeing. So, I'll talk about wellbeing, I'll ask the question what is it, I'm gonna suggest to you that wellbeing can be reasonably well defined by the notion of, ah, the acronym is PERMA where P is positive emotion, E is engagement, R is good relationships, M is meaning and purpose, and A is accomplishment. So, I'm gonna suggest to you these are the five pillars of what human beings who are not suffering, what free human beings choose as positive psychology is about north of indifference. So, I'm gonna say that's the subject matter and then I'm gonna talk about how to measure it and something evolutionary but revolutionary has occurred in measurement and I'll tell you about that. Ah, having talked about measurement, the question rise as can you increase wellbeing and, ah, I didn't work on wellbeing. I spent the 35 years of my career working on, ah, helplessness, depression, suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder and I stayed away from wellbeing and the reason I did was an article in the early 1970s by Phil Brickman which followed 14 winners of the Illinois lottery measuring their happiness and life satisfaction. And what Phil found was for the first six months you get happier but after six months you revert to your usual co-- marginal level. So, I thought, you know, wellbeing, happiness, that's, ah, ah, ah, the froth on the cappuccino and what I really wanted was the espresso underneath it and that was misery and suffering. Ah, and that kept many of us from working on wellbeing. So the question is, ah, was Phil right and can PERMA be built? Where is it like dieting, as you know, uhm, ah, for the most part, ah, dieting doesn't work. I, I sometimes call it a scam because 80 to 95-- you can, you can regain all the weight, you can, ah, lose 5% of your body weight, any of you, in, ah, three weeks by following any diet on the bestseller list but 80 to 95% of you regain all that weight or more in the next three to five years. So the question about wellbeing was is it like dieting. Ah, I did the, ah, watermelon diet, ah, I lost, ah, about 20 pounds in about three weeks, I had, ah, diarrhea for three weeks, ah, but I-- over the next two years I regained the 20 pounds back and that, that's the usual course of event. So the question is is happiness like that, are there things you can do to boost it, but then does it just sink back and the answer turns out to be that Brickman was wrong, that everyone in this audience and all of your patients can actually have more wellbeing than you do now. So, I'll talk about how to build it and I'll talk about random assignment, placebo controlled studies of building wellbeing. Ah, I'm gonna do this in, ah, by doing each one separately. I'll talk about positive emotion and what, ah, you would for the most part call happiness, talk about techniques that build it. Ah, I'll talk about engagement of being one with the music when time stops for you and how to build that, talk about relationships, how to build that, ah, and talk about meaning and about accomplishment. Ah, and finally, and this is the one hint that I wanna talk about, I believe that all building of wellbeing will turn out to be local. So it turns out we've been able to find in random assignment, placebo controlled studies about 12 different techniques which reliable build wellbeing. But only 12, we tried beyond that. I'm gonna suggest to you that the building of wellbeing is local and it happens in consulting room, in marriage, and by an Adam Smith invisible hand mechanism and that's the one hint that you may find useful about psychotherapy. Ah, and, ah, then bringing the first half of the talk to a close, I'll ask the question that since what people have found about the building of PERMA is about individuals. The question rises, ah, can you deal the wellbeing of larger organizations. So, I'll talk about are studies of skill systems and then the largest one of all, ah, the United States Army. Ah, that's the first half to two-thirds of that talk. Then I'm gonna turn to the question of what kind of creatures are we really, what have we been selected for, and I think the human species has been selected for seeing into the future and that what you're doing right now as I'm talking phenomenologically is you're making mental simulations of how you can incorporate what I'm saying into what you do, how you can use this in the future, or how you can get out of here as soon as possible and, ah, get home. But we're-- constantly, it turns out about 40% of the time doing mental simulations of possible futures and evaluating. This is the kind of creature we are and I'm gonna suggest to you this capacity for prospection has really a massive implications for, ah, psychotherapy and for other endeavors. I'll tell you a bit about the, ah, default network, ah, that's been uncovered in the brain, ah, there's prospective network, ah, and, ah, then I'll, I'll try my best to ask the question if we reformulate diagnosis and treatment partially to be not about the past and the present but as disorders of prospection, disorders of how we think about the future can we, ah, as Tim was saying in the last lecture, can we get more focus and do get more progress. So by taking what was in the ground and moving it into the figure and asking can we build techniques for building, making on our-- ourselves the people we love, our clients better prospectors, can we bring about more wellbeing. Ah, and then I tell you, ah, ah, about a very good development in this field. What I'm gonna have to say about positive psychology is more than half bathe people have been working on it now for a decade. What I wanna say about the building of prospection is this is a very hard problem and we're gonna throw it out to you. I'm not gonna be able to, to tell you about how to build prospection, so we're gonna be funding a massively research on how to build prospection. So that's the content of today's talk. 

00:12:10
Flourish (PERMA) 

00:12:10
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, so let me begin with, ah, what is wellbeing. Ah, I think the issue about wellbeing is, is broader than you might think. I think Schopenhauer and Freud as you will know told us that the best we could ever do in life was not to be miserable, not to suffer. So on that formulation, ah, affective psychotherapy moves misery from minus eight to zero, if possible. Uhm, I'm gonna suggest to you the premise that the best that human beings can ever do in life is not to be miserable, is empirically false, ah, morally insidious, and a therapeutic dead end. And, ah, ah, that's what I'm gonna try to do over the next 45 minutes or so. So the question then is if we can hope for more in life, more for our patients than just not suffering, ah, what is it that we wanna build? So, I'm gonna suggest that there are five elements which, ah, we wanna build. Ah, you know, it's important to realize that wellbeing is not just the absence of being miserable. That's what I thought and that's what I was trained to think, ah, that follows from Freud and Schopenhauer. But then when I started to read literature on depression versus happiness, depression versus life satisfaction, I naturally assume that the correlation between sadness, depression, and happiness was minus 1.0. Well, there are at least 30 studies of this and the correlation on average is about minus .2, that is to say you can both be depressed and you can be happy. So, one gets in the way of the other but it doesn't obviate the other. And another way of thinking about it is I, I'm a rose gardener and, ah, if you wanna get a good-- I spent a lot of time weeding and clearing away underbrush and things like that but that's not enough. If you want a good rose, you have to get a good, ah, rose bush to begin with and you have to give it water and sun. Getting rid of the underbrush isn't enough and I think that same is true of our lives. So, ah, then the question is what is this wellbeing stuff? 

00:14:30
• Positive Emotion 

00:14:35
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, and-- so I wanna suggest there are five elements of it and, ah, what the fives in element is not only its contribution to wellbeing, but that it's pursued independently of the other elements. That is there are people who pursue things like meaning even if it brings no happiness, no engagement, no relationships and the like, and these are the five, I think, there are. The first is what we, ah, usually call happiness. It's subject-- subjective wellbeing, smiling, being merry, ah, ah, having a good time, having fun, subjective. Uhm, but it turns out that what's called positive affectivity is though (inaudible ) distributed and that means that half of the people on earth right now, 3.5 billion people don't feel good. Ah, and that we want a consignment to the hell of unhappiness and I think the answer is no because they have other things in life that bring about wellbeing. And, ah, the-- and it's also highly heritable and what we know about changing smilyness, being merry, feeling good, I think, gives you at, at most the possibility of living in the upper range of your biologically sad envelope. I think you got, as therapist, five to 15% ability to increase smilyness. Ah, but there are plenty of other things that one can do as well. Ah, and there's more latitude for some of this as well. 

00:16:05
• Engagement 

00:16:10
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN So the second one of this is engagement, being one with the music, being completely absorbed in what you're doing. Ah, when, when-- and this is what might (inaudible ) calls flow and I'm gonna suggest to you flow is measurable and there are ways of increasing flow. You can have more engagement in life, you can teach patients to have more engagement in life. I'll talk about that in a bit. 

00:16:35
• Relationships 

00:16:35
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN The third thing that I think people pursue for its own sake even if it brings none of the others is good relationships and there have been discoveries in the last decade, ah, about how to build good relationships. Some of you are born being superbly social animals but many of us don't know how to do it very well. It turns out their techniques for increasing, ah, the quality of love and relationships that pass the placebo-controlled random assignment test and I'll talk about one of those. 

00:17:10
• Meaning 

00:17:10
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Uhm, the fourth is meaning and purpose. So, uhm, ah, there-- in biology there's the Dawkins people who say we're a selfish gene people. Ah, and there are the group selection people led by, ah, Ed Wilson and these are people who say that we evolve not only to be selfish creatures but we're hive creatures as well. We've evolved to have love and compassion, that we've evolved for other people and I'm gonna suggest to you one that's true and the notion of meaning belonging to and serving something bigger than you are is buildable. It's every person's birth right, everyone wants it and there are ways that you can build it in your life and as a therapist. 

00:17:55
• Accomplishment 

00:17:55
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN And, ah, finally, I'm gonna talk about accomplishment that independent of all these other things, people want to achieve, they want to, ah, accomplish, they want mastery, and this is the fifth of the, ah, elements that free people pursue. So that's the theory on that-- on-- underlies it and the question then is if you're a therapist or if you decide in your marriage that your job is to increase the PERMA of your spouse, ah, can you measure i? What can you do? So, this gives, uhm, this theory right or wrong, give specificity. 

00:18:30
PERMA Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Measuring, Accomplishment Each is measurable Authentichappiness.org Each is teachable 

00:18:30
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN So, let's talk about measurement. So, it turns out and this is what we've spent a lot of last 15 years on that each of this, uhm, PERMA stage and grades is measurable. So, uhm, I would say that each of them, ah, is measurable with about as good psychometrics as depression needs that is. So, ah, if you're interested in measuring how good your relationships are, there are measures for that that have the same quality as our measures of depression, ah, and they're free, importantly. So on my website authentichappiness.org I have the, ah, 20 leading tests of the PERMA variables. So if you wanna quantify this in yourself or in your patients, they're yours to use. Three and a half million people, ah, have registered of that-- at that website and, ah, people use this all over the world. They're also-- all those is in, ah, Chinese, Spanish, and German as well as in, in English. Ah, so the first part of good news is that the wellbeing of human beings can be measurable. Ah, if, if at the first evolution of psychotherapy conference which I was not at, I had suggested that we should be building and measuring wellbeing, you, you would have laugh and you should have because we had no measures at the time. What we had was measures of pathology. But now we have measures of the opposite of pathology. Uhm, and the second piece of good news is that, ah, Phil Brickman turned out to be wrong, that each of this is teachable. You can actually have more engagement in life than you do now, your patience can have better relationships, your children can have more meaning, and there are techniques that build this. 

00:20:20
Atherosclerotic Heart Disease (red = more death) Reported by CDC Predicted by Twitter r weighted = .67 

00:20:25
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Uhm, so, uhm, let me say a-- about their revolution in measurement that's going on. It's a brand new stuff. Ah, so, I've spent a lot of my life doing questionnaires and in general if we wanted to measure depression or happiness or meaning, we would give a questionnaire. And, ah, a-- as you know there are all sorts of artifacts about questionnaires so if I, if I ask you Julia, how much are you enjoying this conference, there's all sorts of demand characteristics, you're friendly with Jeff, there are motives for saying, "Oh, it's really great." Questionnaires are just filled with artifacts. Uhm, but there's something revolutionary happened about five years ago. I gave a, ah, big data, I gave a keynote address to Google about, ah, three years ago, and got together with the Google Earth people. And I said, "Let's merge Google Earth with wellbeing. Let's ask the question of the measurement of wellbeing ins-- instantly across the planet in time and space," and the way to do it is PERMA has a lexicon. It turns out there are about 45,000 words in English which describe positive emotion or engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment and their opposite. So instead of doing questionnaires, I suggested let's just look at the social media in real time and look at how much these words are deployed. Now, this is of, of considerable measurement as well as political interest so, ah, the Prime Minister of England, ah, to Thanks Giving weeks ago, ah, declared that he would measure the wellbeing of the British people, ah, and he would himself accountable for the success or failure of public policy by changes in wellbeing, not just changes in money but changes in wellbeing. I'm on his statistical committee and what we do is we make 300,000 phone calls every three months and ask questionnaires about wellbeing. But here's what's gonna replace it. The age of the questionnaire is coming to an end. That is we can now assess, we come through, for the study I'm just gonna describe, 80 million tweets and we look for the 45,000 words and phrases that describe wellbeing and on this notion if Mr. Cameron, ah, wants to build a library in Manchester because he thinks it will increase the engagement of students, he doesn't have to go and ask students if they're more engaged, he can look at the 5000 engagement and non-engagement words in Manchester versus Birmingham over time. And so, it, it just for the power of this, uhm, I spend a good deal of my time trying to predict, ah, ah, illness and death and in particular cardiovascular death. Ah, so, we ask the question, ah, could you come through the social media, county by county in the United States and ask the question who-- where is the death rate gonna be highest? So, this is, ah, measure, I think-- let's see if this will tell me which this is, you know, but I think I can guess. On the left hand side, you have the actual death rate county by county in the north east. On the right hand side, you have the wellbeing prediction of the death rate. Ah, so this is 80 million tweets in 1300 counties and what you do is you correlate PERMA and topics with death rate. Uhm, here's a-- and as you can see the weighted prediction is massive. It out predicts every known demographic variable combined, ah, ah, obesity, ah, ah, ah, blood pressure, cholesterol, and the like. It out predicts them, uhm, and here's the kind of texture that you see. 

00:24:30
Twitter language predictive of Atherosclerotic HD morning open use foundation grateful looking fantastic mention trip of for afternoon from we've testing emails office will discovered fabulous folks experience interesting has great presentation forward conference our finished thanks holiday offer among project lots week lunch discussion customer helpful seems market share present running 

00:24:35
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN So, ah, we create statistically topics that predict the county which will have a low death rate from heart disease andt this is one such topic. By the way, the, the, the-- this is lot of information, this slide. It's not just, ah, technicolor. The larger the word, the more predictive each of this is, that is if you live in a county in which the kids are saying "great" a lot, your probability of heart disease is noticeably lower even though you're not one of those people tweeting. 

00:25:05
tight didnt me dick sluts cuddling feel whore fuckin bored guys boyfriend mom whores anymore annoying shits someone bed mad pissed alone hate fuck ivegirlfriend wanna fucking she's serious assholes hes tired asleep honestly sexy sleeping cant gonna mood boobs whos fucked shes shower 

00:25:05
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN And here's the reverse. Ah, these are the, the risk factors, ah, if this is what people are saying in, in-- on Facebook, they're saying "fuck" a lot and "hate" a lot, it turns out your risk is much higher for heart disease and, ah, so we now do this for extroversion, introversion, eroticism and the like and it turns out instead of asking people questions, you can merely ask what the-- what words and phrases do people use to, I think, reveal the underlying, not only underlying personality, ah, but the prediction of health. Ah, so that's the revolution that's coming down in measurement. I'm very excited about it, big data. Ah, everything else I'm gonna talk about for psychotherapy is, ah, truly evolutionary. This one's revolutionary. 

00:25:55
PERMA is Teachable 

00:25:55
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, so, ah, we can measure it. Ah, can it be taught? So, what I'm gonna do for the next 10 minutes is talk about random assignment, placebo controlled test of different techniques for building wellbeing. And I'll try to-- ah, one of the important things about the positive psychology endeavor, ah, people said at the outset, "Well, our Sunday School teacher knows all about happiness," so, uhm, that's a real challenge. So it turned out over the last 15 years, ah, I made a list of about 20 things I didn't know, ah, 15 years ago that the science has uncovered. So I both tried to take you through a very brief tour of, ah, interventions that work and, ah, ah, some of the science underneath it. 

00:26:40
INDIVIDUALS 

00:26:40
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, so-- and this is all comes from individuals, ah, and-- oh, I should say something about the methodology here. So, as some of you know I'm a depressive and a pessimist, I think only a pessimist can do serious work on optimism and, uhm, I take my own medicines. So when someone suggests a good technique for increasing optimism, I try it on myself and if it works on me, I give it to Mandy and my five children, if it works on them, I give it to my graduate students, ah, they do outcome studies on it and then if it works in that context then we do large-scale web studies in which on my website authentichappiness.org. Every so often we put up a link called exercise. If you go to the link it says that, ah, Dr. Seligman would like to find out what's a placebo and what really raises people's wellbeing. So, if you're willing to do it, we're gonna give you an exercise, you'll know if it's a placebo or active, we're gonna ask you to do it for seven days and then we're gonna bug you, ah, every month for six months and measure depression and wellbeing. So that's the test of these things of past. 

00:27:50
PERMA Positive Emotion 3 Good Things 

00:27:50
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, so, positive emotion. Ah, robust finding, ah, every night for the next week write down, before you go to bed, three things that went well and why they went well. Very simple exercise, ah, gets you noticing the good things in life that are happening to you. Ah, and, ah, when you measure people six months later versus placebo controlled, people who do this are, ah, less depression, ah, more life satisfaction, and very importantly it's addictive. So once-- and this is an important distinction, ah, Chris the other day mentioned the importance of smiling when you do positive exercises in the consulting room. Ah, there's another as opposed to what we usually do, uhm, when, ah, you-- the positive exercises are self-maintaining. The reason dieting doesn't work in the long run is no fun to keep turning down chocolate mousse but it turns out to be a lot of fun to walk around the world noticing the good things that are happening to you and thinking I'm gonna write those down tonight. And so it turns out to be addictive. People keep doing them, so that's, ah, ah, one thing. 

00:29:15
Engagement Signature Strengths www.authentichappiness.org 

00:29:15
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Second is, ah, signature strengths. So, ah, we can't do this here but if, if you go to my website, authentichappiness.org, there's a test call the signature strengths test that, ah, uhm, about 2.5 million people have taken around the world. It tells you which your five your highest strengths are. Gratitude, humor, ah, social intelligence, prudence and the like. And then the exercise that we do and you can easily in the clinic is you ask people-- a, a-- I'll do it with you now. I'll do half of it. Close your eyes, ah, think of something you have to do every week at work or at home that you really don't like doing. Okay. Open your eyes. Okay. So, go to the website, find out what your highest strength is and figure out a way to do the thing you don't like using your highest strength. And so, for example, one of my students was, ah, he had to-- he studied in the library till midnight everyday and at midnight he had to walk about 20 blocks through, ah, the most dangerous part of West Philadelphia and this was, ah, the thing he didn't like doing. His job was to re-craft the walk using his highest strength. So, ah, he-- his highest strength was humor and playfulness. So, he bought a pair of roller blades, declared the event, an Olympic event, a stop watch and time himself every midnight to one finding ha-- try to beat his personal best and then when he had asymptoted, he took a longer route and, ah, ah, he dec-- and by the end of about a, a month, this became the favorite time of day. So, re-crafting things you don't like doing using what you're best at, ah, turns out to be quite a powerful technique. Six months later, people who do this are less depressed and, ah, happier. 

00:31:25
Character Strengths and Trauma Exposure → character strengths and post-traumatic growth Especially • Religiousness • Gratitude • Kindness • Hope • Bravery 

00:31:30
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, oh, also, ah, other things that we found out that are relevant to, uhm, the clinic. Ah, I'm very interested in post-traumatic growth and I may talk about that a bit in about five minutes. Ah, but on the website we, we ask the question, we had people, 1700 people came to the website who had truly awful things happened to them and we ask the question who grows and it turns out you can increases and wellbeing and the like and it turns out that there are five character strengths that predict post-traumatic growth are out there, religiousness, gratitude, kindness, hope, and bravery. 

00:32:10
PERMA Relationships Active Constructive Responding Constructive Destructive Active Passive 

00:32:15
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN So that's, ah, positive emotion, engagement, relationships. Ah, I think, thanks to Shelly Gable, there's been, ah, a discovery about marriage counseling which, ah, some of you may know. Ah, in, in marriage counseling we usually teach people things like how to fight better, but, ah, people like Gutmans have discovered there's a lot more to marriage counseling than just removing the negatives. Now, Shelly Gable said, "Let's get people celebrating better together. So, uhm, when you're-- if-- how do you, how do you talk to your spouse when she comes home with a victory? Ah, it's not having a fight, how do you celebrate? Ah, so she's been promoted at work, she comes home and there's a two by two table, active, passive, constructive, destructive, ah, what do you say to her? Well, uhm, what I used to do until I rid-- read this literature was to say, ah, congratulations to you. You deserve it. Ah, that's passive constructive, has zero effect on people. Ah, ah, I work with drill sergeants, ah, we just graduated our 18,000 drill sergeant with these techniques. The-- they do active destructive, they say, "You know what tax bracket that's gonna put us into." Ah, that has negative effects. Passive destructive is changing the subject like "What's for dinner?" Active constructive, ah, which we don't do naturally takes more time, it takes effort, it takes authenticity is, uhm, you know, I've been reading the reports that-- to the corporation that you've written and the last one on the fiscal plan was the single best document that I've seen on, ah, fiscal responsibility in my life. Ah, now, let's relive this together. It-- where were you and she tells you, uhm, exactly what did your boss say to you? Ah, she tells you, "Why do you-- what strengths do you think really got you promoted?" And she starts to tell you that. How can you use that more with family and, ah, i-- i-- in church and the like. And it turns out when you do that, ah, quality of marriage, love, commitment, sexuality increase, probability of divorce decreases.

PERMA Meaning Belonging To and Serving Something Bigger than Self Altruism versus Pleasure 

00:34:40
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN That's relationships. Ah, meaning and purpose, belonging to and serving something larger than you are. Ah, there are several exercises about this. Ah, these are things you all know as therapist but my younger people, you know, a materialistic society don't know, ah, and so I've give an assignment, ah, to my younger students in which I tell them, ah, "Next week do something fun, something pleasurable, or do something philanthropic," and what happens is really quite remarkable and I'm not preaching here. It turns out our hedonic system is wired to help other people. When people do something fun, ah, masturbate, ah, go to the movies, hang out with their friends, when it's over, it's over. When people do something altruistic, it lasts. People become mellow, they can listen to others better. Ah, one of my students described her experience helping her third grade nephew for two hours on the phone about fractions and how for the rest of the day she could listen to others and people liked her more. And then one of my business students said, "I'm in studying business because I wanna be rich, because money brings control, security, and happiness," but I was astonished to find out that I was happier helping another person than I was shopping." And it turns out that's, ah, you know, people will, will often ask her what's the one thing I can do to make me feel better at least momentarily, the most reliable one is just go out the door, find someone who needs help and help them. It turns out statistically that's the single, ah, the sing-- single but short-term effect we have.

•PERMA Accomplishment Self Discipline & GRIT Angela Duckworth Twice as Important as IQ 

00:36:30
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN Ah, and finally, ah, we're very interested in accomplishment, what the ingredients of accomplishment are over and above talent. Ah, this is the work of Angela Duckworth who just won, uhm, a Carter Genius Award. Ah, what Angela has shown in many settings, one of them as we go to, to ninth grade and we measure IQ and we measure GRIT and self-discipline and then we try to predict grades over the next three years and what college are getting to him, we quantify it and it turned out self-discipline is about twice as important as IQ in, ah, academic achievement. So, that's a brief tour through, ah, what we know about individuals, ah, and ways of increasing it. 

00:37:15
The Invisible Hand PERMA as Goal of Therapy 

00:37:20
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN And now I guess I wanna give what I hope will be a good therapeutic hint. The important thing that, ah, David Cameron is doing is not just the measurement of wellbeing but he's publishing the results. Ah, consider the following hypotheticals. Ah, imagine that lawyers make about the same amount of money in England as physicians but the wellbeing of lawyers is much lower by PERMA measurement than the wellbeing of physicians and this gets published. Well, what's the reaction of this? Well, Adam Smith tells us the reaction is law schools so as not to lose students to medical schools are gonna try to find ways to make law more PERMA like. That is to say the building of wellbeing is local. And so then if you decide that your job in life is to make your spouse's PERMA higher and you're gonna measure it, you know a lot more about what engages her, what good relationships are than therapists do generally. Ah, so you-- if you measure it and you declare it as a value, you will find invisible hand local ways of increasing it. So this throws the issue of wellbeing right back into the consulting office. It says, "Yeah, do the gratitude exercises and, ah, uhm, ah, good thing exercises but most importantly start measuring wellbeing and dream up ways that are local with your patients that'll increase positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. So, ah, the notion that therapy should not just be about the relief of misery but the increase of PERMA, ah, strikes me as a plausible goal of therapy, it's measurable, and I think by the published exercises but much more importantly by the therapeutic skill of, ah, uhm, in a good relationship with your client discovering and then building what produces more PERMA is a promising way of, ah, supplementing what we do in therapy. So, let me summarize the first two-thirds of my talk. Ah, I've said that it-- for very interesting reasons, therapy and psychology for the last 120 years had been ab-- has been about misery, it's measurement, and its relief. Ah, we all knew that the positive side of life was worthy but it was in the background and I'm suggesting to you now there are good measures of what was in the background, there are reliable techniques for building it and when a patient comes to us and says, "Doctor, I wanna be happy," what I used to do when that happen, I used to say, "You, you mean don't wanna be depressed?" And this was a case of, ah, ah, "Doctor, I hope you can cure what I have and my respond is, "Mister, I hope you have what I can cure." Ah, but we know now is techniques that actually make people happier and since we deal with whole patients who want not just not to be miserable but want wellbeing, we can do both things now. Ah, and that's more than promissory, we have techniques about that. So, I'm now gonna turn to the second half of the, the figure ground reversal. I've never talked about this publicly before and this is much promissory and, ah, I wanna tell you where I'm coming from. Uhm, I grew up in, in behaviorism and, and, ah, cognitive psychology and, ah, we were dominated by a long history in which the goal of behaviorism was not just to avoid mental events but particularly to avoid mental events about the future. I mean, after all the future is a-- and the future can't affect the present. And, ah, so what we were part of was a very articulate endeavor to throw (inaudible ), ah, out of science and this had a, a very important history that goes back to Galileo in which it was very important to throw purpose out of physical science. Ah, the reason Aristotle told us that, ah, heavy bodies fall to the earth is that falling to the earth is the purpose of a heavy body. It turned out Galileo and then the, the physics of, ah, ah, through Newton and beyond that we didn't need these thing. But telos(ph) also got thrown out of psychology as well but the problem is there is-- there may not be telos(ph) in rocks but there is telos(ph) in people. We pursue the future and we-- there was a hegemony of silence about it and, ah, ah, both psychoanalysis and behaviorism are two great forebears have this model of human beings, there were essentially billiard balls, we had a past history and then acting on us in the present there was what we perceive, what are motivation was and that somehow drove what we did in the future. That model I think is, is, is wrong, dead wrong. Ah, and the reason is that we have evolve to, ah, do just what's you're doing right now generating simulations of possible futures and choosing among them. So, what I'm suggesting is we need no articulate science and practice of prospecting into the future. Now, it's not just the phenomenology that's persuasive here but the neuroscience as well. How many of you know what a default circuit is? Good. I wanna tell you about it then. It's a very another revolutionary thing that's happened in the last decade. Ah, there are several thousand FMRIs studies in which you put people in a tube and you wanna know what lights up in the brain when they do mental arithmetic. Ah, good. Well, you always have to run a control group in this and the control group you typically run is don't just to lie there and not do anything. So, it turns out that there are circuits that when you do a signal to noise search, that light up for mental arithmetic versus the control group. But the control group has a really discreet circuit that almost always lights up. It's called the default circuit now, that's ubiquitous, and it's the same circuit that lights up if you ask people to imagine the future, ah, to navigate mentally through space, ah, ah, to imagine what Jeff is thinking right now, to do other minds. It's the circuit we have for daydreaming and for imagining the future and it's not just going on all the time but it turns out there is a 50-second cycle that you've been going through in this talk in which for 50 second typically you're processing what I'm saying, you're paying attention to the external world and then you go inside for 50 seconds and you do prospecting on it, you daydream with it, you run with it.

00:45:15
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN This is what we're built to do. So it's this, ah, ah, circuit that, ah, ah, seems to be pervasive. Uhm, oh, I've left out-- oh, I'm sorry. Let me just back up and then I'll talk. So, we've-- okay, ah, hold that for a second. Ah, we go in to school and the entire US Army and we do these techniques for increasing wellbeing, ah, these are, ah, social skills of, ah, large classes of kids who are taught literature with positive psychology, this is a measure of their social skills over 18 months. Ah, there are grades go up and, ah, ah, as some of you know, we now do this in the entire United States Army, uhm, about five years ago. The chief of staff came to me and, ah, ah, said post-traumatic stress disorder, ah, panic, depression, divorce, substance abuse, what does positive psychology say about that and, ah, I said to the general staff that, ah, "You just described, ah, the misery, ah, that combat weeks in part of our soldier population. But the susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder and these other things is normally distributed, in the middle are people who are resilient, ah, where resilience is defined as, ah, ah, going through a hard time in combat but three months later being back where you were by physical and psychological measures and then on the right hand tail, you have post-traumatic growth and these are people who often go through a terrible time with loss in combat. But a year later, by our psychological measures are stronger, ah, and healthier than they were before. And so my suggestion, sir, is to move the entire distribution to a post-traumatic growth where upon General Casey allocated $125 million, ordered that from that day forward, positive psychology and resilience will be taught in the entire United States Army and he would create an army that was just as psychologically fit as physically fit. Ah, and he said one other thing, ah, George Casey is a visionary he did this single-handedly, ah, ah, he then said the-- your mo-- we see, we see that you go into schools and you teach teachers the techniques of positive psychology and resilience and then you measure depression, anxiety, wellbeing in the kids, that's the Army model. We got 40,000 teachers in the Army, the drill sergeants and your job, Dr. Seligman will be to see to it that the drill sergeants are trained in the techniques of positive psychology and we will measure the 1.1 million soldiers' wellbeing and, ah, psychopathology as a function of this. 

00:48:30
Findings: Positive Forms of Coping (Scoring Higher is Better) Resilience Training & Psychiatric Diagnoses Frequency of Diagnoses: Training and Non-training Conditions ▣ Mental Health Substance Abuse (PTSD, Anxiety, Depression) ▣ Training ▣ (n = 4,983) 221 (4.44%) 58(1.16%) ▣ Non-training ▣ (n = 2,247) 114 (5.07%) 64 (2.85%) ▣ Total (n = 7,230) 335 (4.63%) 122 (1.69%) 

00:48:35
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN So that's what-- so every, every, ah, month, ah, about 180 drill sergeants come to the University of Pennsylvania and my faculty trains them and what I've been talking about today and the army has measured this and, ah, ah, ah, this is a study of several thousand soldiers in which there's one master resilience trainer per battalion. So, this is-- was there a trainer in your battalion as they go to Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a measure of positive coping and, ah, when you're deployed, it turns out if you've had a trainer in your battalion, your coping gets better or gets worse in deployment and then the people who haven't had it. Ah, and this is the latest, ah, thing I've seen. So, ah, remember this is a universal prevention study, you wanna look at the last column, the percentage, the percentage of people who would-- and these are having had a, a master resilience trainer in your battalion, it's the percentage of people who have had PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and it significantly higher if you don't have a trainer in your battalion and for substance abuse it's about, ah, ah, twice as high. Ah, and so the Army has found, ah, that this is effective and is now a regular part of Army training.

Homo Prospectus ▣ Psychodynamic ▣ Behavior Therapy ▣ Cognitive Therapy ▣ Phenomenological ▣ Default Network ▣ Evolution ▣ Memory of the Future 

00:49:55
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN So, let me now skip forward to where I was, ah, just summarizing that. There's reason to believe that the resilience and positive psychology techniques work reliably with individuals, you can incorporate them in the consulting room, but very importantly they work on, ah, larger organizations as well. So, back to where I was which was the argument that, ah, we are Homo Prospectus that are, uhm, forebrain is not just about knowledge, that it's about, ah, the prediction of the future, the notion of prospection, ah, and I had gone through the arguments, ah, of the imp-- for the importance of this. Ah, and so what I wanna close with is the evolutionary possibility for psychotherapy. So, what, what might the importance of prospection mean for what we do in the consulting room, ah, and here again I, I wanna, ah, again, do truth in advertising, ah, most of the people in this audience now do a lot more therapy than I've done in my life and notice better and I'm viewing it now from the outside as I, I didn't once to. So let's just talk about, ah, diagnoses. Ah, in depression, in, in the cognitive therapy of depression, ah, ah, Tim has told us about the cognitive triad, this, ah, negative view of the self, negative view of the world, and then negative view of the future. This theory says that it's the negative view of the future that wears the pants in depression. It's the hopelessness that wears the pants. So, ah, what we've got here is a dis-- pers-- disfunction of prospection. Uhm, so, when your client thinks-- if I try to talk things over with my boss, he won't listen. Notice, that's a, a conditional, it's a future orientation which is, in fact, ah, wrong and narrowed. Ah, and indeed I think we can recast, ah, ah, in insomnia, if I, if I can't get to sleep now, tomorrow is gonna be awful. These are, ah, the preponderance of this material, I believe, is prospections into the future and these are prospections that are usually wrong. So the question here is, ah, recasting the hopelessness, the narrowness of, of prospection, ah, into terms in which you can make it better. So, what does this mean for treatment? So, what I'm trying to say is for the phenomenon of the anxiety and depressive disorders, by and large, these are disorders of prospection in which we've got distorted thoughts about the future. So, what can we do about that? How do we treat disorders of prospection? Well, uhm, ah, people in solution focused therapy have done this for a while, ah, ah, ACT does it and good cognitive therapy does it but the problem is the techniques haven't been encoded that, ah, we haven't focused on what was in the ground and, ah, I don't think I'm gonna be able to tell you how to do this because I don't know. How do we make the prospections of our clients more richer, more accurate, and better evaluated. So, I think for the full potential of therapy to occur, for the full potential of CBT to occur, we need to answer that question. I'm gonna close by telling you, ah, I don't know the answer to that question and it's too hard for me and by the way as you, as you-- Tim and I meet once a month and we talk about this as Tim doesn't know either.

00:53:55
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN And so the question is how can we get the therapeutic and scientific community to work on the improvement of prospection. And so, uhm, we're going to get the Templeton Foundation-- here's what I just said. We're gonna give, uhm, ah, 15 $200,000 grants for people who will investigate this. The letters of intent are due January 1st, they don't have to be long but here are the five things that we're going to fund. The first is the measurement of prospection. Ah, questionnaire measurements of prospection, individual differences, and big data measurement of prospection. The third is what is the mechanism of prospection, both the cognitive mechanism, the neuroscientific mechanism, and the computational modeling of prospection. Ah, the third is the application of prospection. Where, in what walks of life, ah, the corporation, school, ah, the clinic can we use more prospection? Ah, and most important, and this is where I, I solicit from you from January 1st the two-page letter of intent, how do you build, what's your best idea and your way of testing how to improve prospection. Ah, we have another category, ah, which is called other, ah, here's where to submit and that's because we, we don't even, there are unknown unknowns here. So let me summarize what I've had to say today. Uhm, I grew up with two huge blind spots about therapy and about psychology more generally which came to us from the past history of psychology. The first was that the clinic and the goal of psychology, the Freud and Schopenhauer idea, was our goal was to alleviate misery and I'm all for that. But there's another arrow we can now add to our quiver. We cannot only alleviate misery but we can measure and build wellbeing. So that was the first message in what I said. And, ah, that's more than promissory. There's now good measurement and intervention work on that. But since this is an evolution of psychotherapy conference, what I wanted to talk about was where I think things may move between now in Anaheim in 2017. The second lacuna, the second blind spot that we had was that human beings were somehow the, the billiard ball embodiments of our past history and our present. And that somehow produce the future, and I'm suggesting that in the clinic and in psychology generally, we need to figure ground reversal. We are not creatures of the past and the present. We are creatures of the future and if the clinic can lead the way in telling us how to be better creatures of the future, that this I think is of, ah, great promise not only for the clinic but for, ah, the planet generally. Thank you.
