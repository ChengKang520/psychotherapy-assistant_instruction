Narrative Skills: Practice exercises for developing counseling skills Par one: Developing curiosity with Lorraine Hedtke Ph.D. and John Winslade Ph.D. 

00:00:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Hi. My name is Lorraine Hedtke. 

00:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And my name's John Winslade and we are both professors in the counseling program at California State University San Bernardino. 

00:00:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And we're gonna be working together today to, um, make some counseling conversations that specifically are practice-type conversations. Our hope is is that you'll be able to watch them and learn from them so that you can, uh, get a sense of how to work with narrative practices in the classroom and then with your clients. 

00:01:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. The aim here is not to represent a whole counseling interview but to start from the assumption that any kind of counseling is a series of different kinds of conversations and what we're wanting to show you today, uh, a range of these different kinds of conversation in small pieces so that we can show them and that you can take them away and practice them. 

00:01:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So what John and I often speak about when we're teaching is that it is im-, important to listen to particular kinds of conversation, that simply getting people to tell a story,um, is not necessarily helpful, but that we actually want to select out which stories, um, that we want people to tell and which stories, um, are . . . and some stories are actually more helpful than other stories and so we're gonna highlight some of those pieces so that you can kinda hear some of those distinctions between what is helpful, what is not helpful. 

00:02:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Now since it's also that, as people learn counseling, they learn a set of skills, but not always when and how to use these skills, and the aim here of our, um, practice sessions that we're gonna do today is to illustrate how similar kinds of skills can be used in different ways at different points or in different conversations in a counseling relationship. 

00:02:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And one other piece of it, if, if I could just add to that John, um, is that often times when students learn how, um, to become counselors they are, um, scared of asking questions (crosstalk)that they've learned that reflection's important, that paraphrasing's important, their summarization is important, but the art of questioning actually gets, um, lost, um, along the wayside, uh, and John and I actually think a little differently that, um, we want students to learn how to be questioners and in fact, um, that we want students to learn how to become, uh, phenomenal questioners, but not just to ask questions about any old thing. You have to know what kinds of questions to ask and that that is um, uh, an experience of practicing, and practicing and practicing, um, to become good questioners. 

00:03:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:03:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So let's talk about narrative therapy because this is, um, the kind of work that we are trying to illustrate here. 

00:03:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:03:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, do you wanna say what you understand narrative therapy to be? 

00:03:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. In a nutshell? That's a pretty big (crosstalk)question. Yeah, uh, in thirty words or less, um, uh . . . What I understand narrative therapy to be is that it is the ways in which the narratives of our lives produce, um, us into existence. Uh, so um, we all have different plots, different stories, different themes, um, that are a part of our lives and we all have multiple stories, um, that we can tell about who we, um, uh, might be on a given day, um, and that narrative therapy kind of allows us to play with those ideas, play with those stories, play with those themes, um, and tell the story from, um, uh, the vantage point of multiplicity, um, and that this gives us, uh, uh, a lovely freeing way of being in the world, that we can tell the story from uh, a different vantage point, um, and it changes experience. It produces is into a different way of being in the world. 

00:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)It's a hard question, I know. 

00:04:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So can I pick up a couple of things (crosstalk)in there. One thing that you talked about then was that, um, stories produce us rather than that they are simple reports, so, of something that happens somewhere else. 

00:04:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes please. Mm-hmm. 

00:04:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Um, producing suggests that the story you tell makes a difference, it matters, (crosstalk)it affects the future. 

00:05:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. (crosstalk)Right. Yes. 

00:05:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um . . . 

00:05:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. We live into our stories. 

00:05:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:05:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm, and beco- . . . can become our stories and our stories, um, uh, access, um, who we want to be as well. 

00:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. There's a lot of people who think that what a narrative practice is about is just getting people to tell their story. 

00:05:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:05:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. You know, I don't think that way at all. I think it's um, it's more a question of asking about the stories that are telling them rather than the telling them telling stories about themselves. 

00:05:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. That's a really important distinction. 

00:05:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:05:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. You know? Tha- . . . Because a lot of people say, "Oh I do narrative therapy. I get people (crosstalk)to tell their, tell their stories." 

00:05:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)I'll get people to tell their story. Yeah . . . 

00:05:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:05:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . I hear that a lot. 

00:05:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Um, and to me that's not narrative therapy? 

00:05:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:05:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right? Um, that's a ga-, about getting people to tell their, um, what is rehearsed in their mind or what stories have been told about them that they think that they're supposed to be. 

00:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So the stories are not always their own ones. They're sometimes other people's stories about (crosstalk)us. 

00:05:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)About who they are. Yeah. 

00:05:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And that brings into play a lot of the background cultural (crosstalk)stories that influence and shape what people can draw from in order to shape their own stories. 

00:06:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. And not just, um, the background cultural stories, um, but for me, I'm always thinking about that idea of a audience and . . . 

00:06:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:06:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . And who else is shaping my story along side of me, that I'm never telling my story exclusively. I never own my story exclusively that my story or actually it should always be my "stories." It's always a (crosstalk)plural. 

00:06:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Mm. 

00:06:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Um, is always being shaped by, um, the relationships of my life, right? So it's about, um, all the people who have traveled with me, um, all the living, all the dead people in the past and the present and the future . . . 

00:06:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:06:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . who are co-constructing those stories with me 

00:06:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. When you talk about all my people . . . 

00:06:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:06:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . or all our people . . . 

00:06:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Um, it leads me to the point that, um, narrative practice is, is implicitly multicultural. 

00:06:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yes. 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, in s-, in a way that some other therapies are, I don't believe are. 

00:07:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:07:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Narrative practice is not just about layering a piece of multicultural sensitivity around . . . 

00:07:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:07:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . What is otherwise done in therapy so much as it is about think mo-, thinking culturally right all the way through. 

00:07:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:07:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, but not all cultural stories are equal. 

00:07:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um . . . 

00:07:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Some stories speak more loudly than others don't they? 

00:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Some stories get to dominate (crosstalk)people's understanding simply because they are more widespread . . . 

00:07:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. Sure. 

00:07:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Or more rehearsed, or repeated more often, or have legislation behind them . . . 

00:07:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:07:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Or um, um, uh, empirical studies behind them, (crosstal)or (crosstalk)part what is gets normalized . . . 

00:07:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yep. (crosstalk)Yep. Yep. 

00:07:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Or part of normalizing judgement . . . All of those things make some stories more powerful than others. 

00:07:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. That's right. 

00:07:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Uh-huh. 

00:07:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And then narrative therapy, I believe, works to, um, examine the effects of, of those issues of power. So we want to, often times, uh, as narrative practitioners want to make those, um, uh, power plays if you will, transparent, so that we ca-, can look at them as to whether or not they are helpful in a client's life. 

00:08:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. In the process, um, there is an implicit challenge to some of the ideas that have been quite powerful and quite dominant in psychology for a hundred years or more. 

00:08:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yes. 

00:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, especially the humanistic stories. Um, narrative practice draws, um, from the critiques of humanistic thinking . . . 

00:08:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:08:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . That emerged in, um, philosophy . . . 

00:08:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:08:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Particularly in social constructionist (crosstalk)and in um, post-structuralist, uh, philosophical movements. 

00:08:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Yep. 

00:08:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um . . . 

00:08:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And feminists. 

00:08:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . And feminist (crosstalk)theory, yeah, which challenged the idea that the individual is the center of their own universe and instead suggests that um, people are, um, uh, exist in worlds and make decisions and act, uh, in worlds that are much more relational, much more (crosstalk)cultural 

00:09:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Li- . . . And linguistic. 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Much more influenced by the linguistic, um . . . 

00:09:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. You're right. 

00:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Forces at work in (crosstalk)people's lives. (crosstalk)Mm. 

00:09:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstal)Right. Absolutely. (crosstalk)Right. Yeah. Okay. So these are, are some of the ideas behind narrative therapy that are, that speak to my heart . . . 

00:09:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:09:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . Um, if you will, um, and that they are certainly some of the ideas that, as we're doing the counseling vignettes, um, that will, um, be reflected in the kind of questions that we ask, the way in which I think when I'm talking with a, with a client, um, and certainly some of the relational ways in which I sit with clients (crosstalk)in some of the um, ethical responsibility that I take up as a narrative counselor. 

00:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So what we're gonna see today are a series of exercises, if you'd like. They are not meant to represent whole counseling conversations or purposes. They're edited and they are intended to be used as introductions to different aspects of the counseling, of, of different kind, kinds of conversation and they're intended to be opportunities for you to, um, uh, to observe and then to go away and practice yourselves, um, in order to build the skills that are useful for a who-, for um, a narrative practice and we hope that, um, people will both enjoy these conversations and learn something from them. 

00:10:35

00:10:35
A Conversation of Curiosity 

00:10:35
Introduction of Curiosity by John and Lorraine followed by two demonstrations 

00:10:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. All right, so, um, John, we're talk for a little bit about curiosity, uh, and so if we can set in context what we're about to do, (crosstalk)um, cuz we're gonna have a couple of conversations that demonstrate, um, kind of the art and practice uh, of curiosity and how we have a conversation, um, that is not initiated from the place of a problem but how do you have a conversation from, uh, just the point of being curious. 

00:11:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. And, and I think the reason for doing that is that n-, narrative practice is built on the asking of questions, um, and it's the, the asking of questions that generates new, new meanings and new experience if we ask the right kind of conversations and I say that because, um, in the discourse of counseling, qui-, asking questions has had a bad press. I mean (crosstalk)people are being told to stop asking questions. 

00:11:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm. Right. Right. 

00:11:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And in some ways, for very good reasons, because, um, sometimes people have asked questions in the past that turned a conversation into an interrogation rather than . . . 

00:11:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:11:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . A con- . . . Uh, uh, an exchange of conversation and generative conversation. 

00:11:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:11:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, and so I think it's really important that we try to figure out what's the difference between a curious conversation that is, uh, honoring and respectful and one that's an interrogation. 

00:12:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Ca-, can I make, um, one thought about that (crosstalk)is I think that . . . A-, and you can tell me if this fits for you but, um, my sense is that one of those differences is that, um, a question, uh, a conversation that's based in curiosity joins with and honors the client's meanings as opposed to an interrogation is a conversation where I'm imposing my meaning or my interpretation into the (crosstalk)conversation. Would that be a fair (crosstalk)distinction? 

00:12:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm. I think (crosstalk)that's right and I think the whole movement towards using assessment criteria and diagnostic schema in (crosstalk)the background in the, in the counselor's mind, um, works against genuine curiosity. (crosstalk)Um, it actually gets people to think about the checklist in their own head (crosstalk)and to try and fit the client into the counselor's schema (crosstalk)and way of thinking and to measure them against them, and that is what feels like an interrogation for people. It feels like something is being done to them. It feels like a process of (crosstalk)power, um, and that's what we're trying to avoid. 

00:13:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Mm-kay. (crosstalk)Right. Right. Okay. And so we could fall into those loopholes of thinking about intake forms, assessment forms . . . 

00:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:13:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . Um, where I'm trying to pigeon-hole a person . . . 

00:13:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:13:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . Um, rather than join with them and be genui-, genuinely curious. 

00:13:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So the difference is, as I think of it, that the aim of, um, counseling is to learn something about the other person rather than to try and fit them into what I know better about them. 

00:13:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:13:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Um . . . 

00:13:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So, um, I know it, when I've heard you talk about this before that you've used the term, uh, finding out what somebody holds precious. 

00:13:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:13:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right? That, uh, um, fit? 

00:13:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yeah and, and what we're trying to demonstrate in these exercises that we're about to show is that, um, it's possible to start anywhere. You don't actually have to have a problem. 

00:13:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:14:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. People have associated that kind of exploration with problem exploration . . . 

00:14:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . But it actually doesn't have to be about a problem. It can be about something very ordinary in life . . . 

00:14:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:14:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . And if we are curious about it, about something kind of ordinary and everyday, it can help us to understand anything can be a starting place to help us to understand what a person hold precious, what they give value to, what their life is an expression of and therefore what is important to them, and, and I, I guess curiosity enables us to actually put into words, um, a, a new construction of that that sometimes people haven't experienced before or (crosstalk)haven't put together before or haven't put into words before, and that to me, is actually therapeutic to do that. 

00:14:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm. Mm. So it's therapeutic to form those things, of the stories from, um, what they hold dear, to perhaps how they define themselves or the actions they take on their own behalf. 

00:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Well yes, stories in the sense of what they do and what things (crosstalk)have happened in life, like the plot events, and then uh, the connection that with what people hold dear or what they give meaning to, what, what they form identity around, what they, um, perform meaning around in, in the way that, um, Jerome Bruner wrote it I think. Um, one of those things, um, are possible if we are genuinely, um, curious in the sense that we're talking about here, which isn't about asking questions in order to find out information. (crosstalk)It's about . . . By the way, I used the word "therapeutic" before. I wanna clarify that. I don't think of therapy as meaning "cure." Um, I think of therapy as meaning "generating a way forward in life." Um, and that is the aim of counseling for me. (crosstalk)Um, and it's a different aim than some people would have. 

00:15:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right. Okay. Okay. (crosstalk)Right. So I wanna um, uh, reference a, a, a passage out of, um, Joel Friedman and (ph)Jean Combs' book (crosstalk)that I, that I like that speaks to, to that, is that our questions are about, um, creating, um, and generating experience rather than accessing experience. 

00:16:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Or reporting on it. 

00:16:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:16:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yeah, (crosstalk)um . . . So when you ask a question and get an answer from (crosstalk)somebody that exists somewhere else. 

00:16:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:16:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. You're actually, often making connections and building . . . 

00:16:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And generating and producing. 

00:16:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Building (crosstalk)identity and producing a future. 

00:16:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yes. (crosstalk)Exactly. Okay. (crosstalk)So . . . 

00:16:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)There's an explanation that I just wanna throw in there, (crosstalk)um, and that is one that Michael White used that he drew from, um, (ph)Pierre Boudure. 

00:16:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Mm. 

00:16:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, he talked about, um, exoticizing the domestic rather than domesticating the exotic. (crosstalk)It is a mouthful but it's a beautiful phrase when you unpack it a little bit. (crosstalk)What he's saying is let's take ordinary, everyday, domestic experience, (crosstalk)domestic meaning . . . Just personal . . . 

00:16:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Which is a mouthful. (crosstalk)Uh, okay. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:17:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . And, um, make it seem wonderful and exotic . . . 

00:17:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Um, and, you know, really fascinating. 

00:17:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And if you do that, um, you're gonna tend to gonna produce good, good practice . . . 

00:17:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . And people are gonna experience themselves as being affirmed rather than, um, put down . . . 

00:17:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:17:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . As opposed to domesticating the exotic which is the opposite. (crosstalk)It's saying, "Look for whatever is exotic and problematic in people's (crosstalk)lives and give it some kind of meaning in my domestic account of my domestic (crosstalk)system." 

00:17:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Which would include kind of diagnostic (crosstalk)labels . . . 

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Would include diagnostic . . . 

00:17:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. (crosstalk)Absolutely. Okay. 

00:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So what we're gonna do in the, in the interviews is, um, demonstrate, um, a very simple skill that can be practiced in classrooms, practiced with students trying to learn, (crosstalk)um, counseling, on how can you be curious about, um, just anything that's ordinary, everyday, um, and create that kind of experience that (crosstalk)you're talking about, that exotic (crosstalk)experience. 

00:18:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)If you read a lot of the narrative practice books about narrative practice, they often have examples of questions that you might ask. 

00:18:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And to me it's important in, in learning to do that kind of work, that you're not just parroting questions cuz if they, if you do that . . . 

00:18:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:18:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . You won't actually learn to (crosstalk)do it very well. Um, it's more important to build the questioning on the basis of an attitude of curiosity and fascination and interest, which um, actually makes counseling work, um, quite, um, invigorating and enlivening because (crosstalk)you're always learning about somebody else and about life in general as you do so. So should we go forward and (crosstalk)do these counseling conversations . . . 

00:18:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Yeah. Absolutely. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yep. I think so. 

00:18:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . About something totally ordinary? 

00:18:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Something totally ordinary. 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Okay. 

00:18:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Sounds wonderful. Thank you. Okay. 

00:18:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Thank you. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:50
The Conversation 1: Lorraine and Carrie 

00:18:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So Carrie . . . It's nice to see you. 

00:18:55
CARRIE It's nice to see you too. (crosstalk)Always. 

00:19:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Thanks. Yeah. Same. Thanks for, um, agreeing to have this conversation with me. Um, uh, uh, uh, a couple things I just wanna mention: first, obviously we're filming, um, the conversation, and what we're, uh, intending to do with it is use this as a teaching tool for people so that they can see how, uh, uh, construct counseling conversations and kind of how do you practice a counseling conversation. Um, and my thought was is that you and I would have a conversation that demonstrates curiosity, um, and is kind of similar to some of the things that we've done in class, um, to explore a topic that is not connected to a problem that, that is just something that can explore. 

00:19:40
CARRIE Okay. 

00:19:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Would that be okay? 

00:19:40
CARRIE Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Absolutely. 

00:19:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay, um, and as I'm asking you questions . . . If I go into any place that is either uncomfortable or um, you know, even though we're not intending to talk about problems and stuff, um, as I ask a question that feels tender, um, that I want just to reassure you that you don't have to answer anything that is uncomfortable and that, that we can um . . . Just let me know that. 

00:20:00
CARRIE Thank (crosstalk)you. 

00:20:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay? Yeah. Okay. Uh, and so my thought was, um, since I, I, um, know that you are a pet owner, um, that I would like to ask you about, um, your life as a pet owner . . . 

00:20:15
CARRIE Okay. 

00:20:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . Um, and you have a dog? 

00:20:20
CARRIE I have a dog. A small dog. 

00:20:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Do you have only one dog? 

00:20:20
CARRIE I have one dog at this time, yes. 

00:20:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And is it a "he" or a "she"? 

00:20:25
CARRIE She. 

00:20:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And is she your only pet? 

00:20:25
CARRIE She is my only pet. 

00:20:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And would you tell me her name? 

00:20:30
CARRIE (ph)Emmy-May, (crosstalk)and I usually introduce her as Emmy first because people call her "Emma." So Emmy and then Emmy-May. (crosstalk)That's . . . 

00:20:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Emmy-May? Okay. (crosstalk)What . . . Do you call her Emmy-May or do you call her Emmy? 

00:20:40
CARRIE Depends. 

00:20:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:20:40
CARRIE I will call her Emmy when it's just your average interaction with my dog and then if I need to get her attention or if she tries to like, take off, or she's doing something . . . I know it sounds crazy, but if she's doing something she shouldn't do I call her Emmy-May, which . . . 

00:20:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:20:55
CARRIE . . . my sister and I were both raised with first and middle names . . . 

00:21:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:21:00
CARRIE . . . And we're the only two in the family they call, get called by those, and May is actually my sister's middle name. 

00:21:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Oh. 

00:21:05
CARRIE Yes, cuz she named her cat after me so it was my kind of getting even. 

00:21:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. I see. 

00:21:10
CARRIE So when she's in trouble I do what my mother did: I call her by full name, Emmy- May (crosstalk)so she knows. 

00:21:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:21:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So your sister named her cat . . . 

00:21:15
CARRIE Yes. 

00:21:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . After you? 

00:21:20
CARRIE Yes. 

00:21:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh, and what is that cat's name? 

00:21:20
CARRIE It's actually, um, my nickname, which is (ph)Birdy. 

00:21:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Birdy. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:21:25
CARRIE (crosstalk)So the cat's named Birdy, (crosstalk)so . . . 

00:21:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay, and s- . . . Um, this happened, uh, uh, uh, (crosstalk)before your dog? 

00:21:30
CARRIE (crosstalk)Years prior, years prior. 

00:21:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. I see. So thi-, so this was a, um, retaliative stamp was it? 

00:21:35
CARRIE Mine was. I don't know what her intention (crosstalk)was, but mine was like, "Well . . ." 

00:21:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, yours. Right. Okay. Uh-huh. If you . . . 

00:21:40
CARRIE And I don't have children so here's (crosstalk)your namesake, so . . . 

00:21:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. 

00:21:40
CARRIE Emmy- May. 

00:21:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. Is your sister . . . Does she enjoy having your dog named after her (crosstalk)(inaudible ) ? 

00:21:49
CARRIE (crosstalk)You know, she's not commented negatively (crosstalk)so . . . And she calls her her niece, which is kind of silly but . . . 

00:21:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Okay. 

00:21:55
CARRIE "How's my niece today?" 

00:21:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:21:55
CARRIE It gave her a little bit of ownership with the dog. 

00:21:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh- huh. Uh-huh. 

00:22:00
CARRIE As weird as that sounds. 

00:22:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Yeah. Now . . . And what kind of dog is Emmy- May? 

00:22:05
CARRIE (crosstalk)So . . . She's a Kirin terrier (crosstalk)so (ph)Todo (crosstalk)but she's blonde. 

00:22:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)To- . . . Right. Okay, so she, she's the blonde and gold- . . . 

00:22:10
CARRIE Yes. 

00:22:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . toned kind of (crosstalk)maybe similar to your hair color almost. 

00:22:10
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yes. (inaudible ) Yes. 

00:22:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. 

00:22:15
CARRIE T- . . . And I used to be the same hair color but right now I guess . . . 

00:22:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:22:15
CARRIE . . . Sadly, has the same hair (crosstalk)color, but yeah. 

00:22:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. And she's a little, little one. (crosstalk)She's . . . You know . . . 

00:22:20
CARRIE (crosstalk)She's fairly little. (crosstalk)I'm gonna say she's . . . Yeah, she would be able to fit on my lap. (crosstalk)The length . . . So, yeah . . . Not because I put her there because . . . 

00:22:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:22:31
CARRIE (crosstalk)When I'm home she just (crosstalk)assumes it's her couch so, (crosstalk)so yeah . . . 

00:22:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)She's there? (crosstalk)Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
CARRIE . . . About that big. 

00:22:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. And how long have you had her? 

00:22:35
CARRIE I have had her for, um, a little less than two years. 

00:22:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

00:22:40
CARRIE So . . . 

00:22:40
Inquiring into the pre-history of the relationship 

00:22:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. When you, um, were thinking about getting a dog, um, was there a reason that you gravitated to this particular kind of a dog? 

00:22:50
CARRIE I didn't actually research the dog. I . . . It was a Christmas Day situation where I had um . . . I was kind of going through a little hard time in my life (crosstalk)and my niece was out for visit and Christmas Day there was actually a pet store open and um, which I shouldn't have bought a dog from a pet store, but anyway . . . And so I decided that um, "Hey we should go look at the pet store" . . . 

00:23:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Sure. 

00:23:10
CARRIE . . . Thought it would cheer me up . . . 

00:23:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:23:10
CARRIE . . . And um, so we went to the pet store and she grabbed a baseba- . . . Sh- . . . There was a little ball in (crosstalk)her, her crate, so she grabbed it and she had barked right before she grabbed it and then she threw it and I went, well, cuz I play ball, and it's like, "Hmm. Interesting." (crosstalk)So I kind of made note of it and I went back week after week for three weeks and I kind of like, prayed about it and I was like, you know, "If I, I can get this dog I gotta be able to afford it so she needs to come down in price," and I just kind of kept visiting and the last week I went there was another dog which was really (crosstalk)cute and um, she . . . I was looking at the other dog . . . 

00:23:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm. Mm-hmm. 

00:23:45
CARRIE . . . And she ended up barking (crosstalk)when I was looking at the other dog and I turned back around. I'm like, "All right. I'm sold. I want that one. (crosstalk)She's playful, she's talkative, so (crosstalk)I'll, then I'll take that one, so . . . 

00:23:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. So what did you take that, that bark to mean? 

00:24:00
Exploring meaning is about establishing points of difference 

00:24:00
CARRIE "Hey!" (crosstalk)You know . . . "You've been coming to buy me! What's up?" 

00:24:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:24:05
CARRIE (crosstalk)So I did. I kind of took it like . . . 

00:24:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
CARRIE "You're supposed to be here for (crosstalk)me, so . . ." It sounds kind of crazy but it's just . . . 

00:24:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. When you first brought her home, in those first couple of months with her . . . 

00:24:15
CARRIE Okay. 

00:24:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . What difference did it make in your life? You said you were going through a little bit of a difficult time and (crosstalk)so what difference did it make having Emmy- May in your life at that time? 

00:24:25
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yeah. The first couple weeks were difficult cuz she ended up being a very sick dog (crosstalk)which is probably why she was brought down in price and (crosstalk)um, I kind of, I really struggled. I would say the first couple of months were actually very (crosstalk)difficult and I contemplated whether I could actually keep her . . . 

00:24:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:24:40
CARRIE . . . just because of . . . I was . . . It was bad timing, you know? I was at work and really (crosstalk)got a dog probably when I shouldn't have when I needed company but maybe wasn't the best for the, (crosstalk)the dog . . . 

00:24:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
CARRIE . . . And um, it was really difficult . . . 

00:24:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
CARRIE . . . And I thought about giving her up and my mom was like, "No," you know, "You . . . This is your responsibility and . . ." 

00:24:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:55
CARRIE . . . You know . . . "It'll turn around." (crosstalk)And so I had spent thousands of dollars on her . . . 

00:25:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:00
CARRIE . . . by that point . . . 

00:25:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:00
CARRIE . . . but um . . . So the first couple months it was actually . . . 

00:25:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. It was very (crosstalk)difficult. 

00:25:05
CARRIE . . . (crosstalk)a very difficult (crosstalk)relationship . . . 

00:25:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. Right. Yeah. 

00:25:05
CARRIE . . . and I felt bad cuz she was stinking cute . . . 

00:25:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:25:10
CARRIE . . . and she was fun and in that way when I'd watch her play cuz she liked to chase the ball . . . She actually plays soccer . . . 

00:25:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:15
CARRIE . . . where she kicks the ball . . . 

00:25:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm. 

00:25:15
CARRIE . . . (crosstalk)and she puts one in her mouth and then she kicks the ball to you (crosstalk)which was way cool and in those moments I was totally . . . Yeah, y- . . . 

00:25:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:25:20
CARRIE I have videos - too many videos - that were where you can hear me laughing . . . 

00:25:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:25:25
CARRIE . . . but the idea of having to take care of her and the financial responsibility and it not (crosstalk)just being . . . I guess she just wasn't my saving grace that I wanted at that moment. 

00:25:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm. 

00:25:35
CARRIE It was very difficult for me (crosstalk)cuz I wanted a good distraction . . . 

00:25:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:25:40
CARRIE . . . and she became a difficult, painful because I didn't wanna care fo- . . . I was worried it would break my heart if (crosstalk)she died so that kind of scared me and, and made it difficult but then time went on and I think . . . 

00:25:55
Exploring significance of an event for identity story 

00:25:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. So Carrie, what was called forward in you at that time when she was very sick and needed, um, to make this big financial commitment and this big emotional commitment to her. Um, what was called forward in you to be able to do what you did? 

00:26:10
CARRIE Well I kind of had to suck up a lot pain that I already had, I think. (crosstalk)I had to, um . . . Well my schedule was really about work and then my dog and (crosstalk)making sure she was well so it really changed my, my schedule but I really had to . . . It required me to basically just delve deep and suck it up and say, "You know what, I have to do A, B, and C (crosstalk)with this dog and it's my responsibility so this is difficult. Now (crosstalk)I don't want a dog to die and I don't wanna attach myself to something that's going to die but it's my responsibility and (crosstalk)while I have her I have to be good to her so I (crosstalk)kinda had to push my (crosstalk)selfishness aside, which is weird I know, she's a dog but I was going through so much and I really wanted this dog to be the thing that fixed (crosstalk)this and she, she wasn't . . . 

00:27:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:27:05
CARRIE . . . which also meant, unfortunately, that I had to look at . . . "Okay. That didn't fix it and so how do I fix what's wrong? (crosstalk)So it required me actually still looking at what I have to (crosstalk)fix. Does that make sense? 

00:27:20
Avoiding the story of pathology and focusing on agency 

00:27:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. It does make sense. Um, did . . . I-, i- . . . So in what way did Emmy-May help bring your focus into a different place you think? 

00:27:30
CARRIE Because she didn't . . . She wasn't a distraction for me in the good way that I wanted her to be. 

00:27:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:35
CARRIE I think, um, I realized, "You know what? Problems are gonna still be there." 

00:27:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
CARRIE "You can't sit there and like it doesn't exist." 

00:27:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:45
CARRIE Yes, even if you have a hard time, like, if I have this hard time and then I have another hard time, this hard time can distract from that one. 

00:27:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:27:50
CARRIE But when this one's fixed . . . 

00:27:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:27:55
CARRIE . . . that one's still there. 

00:27:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:55
CARRIE So, in having Emmy I've learned that, even if I have a good distraction or a bad distraction, that core of what I keep avoiding, it's, it's still, it's still there, (crosstalk)so she gets to be a good (crosstalk)distraction sometimes now but . . . 

00:28:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:28:10
CARRIE . . . And I'm sure she'll still . . . You know, she's had some issues still, health issues . . . 

00:28:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:28:15
CARRIE . . . and she distracts for moments but what I got her for, to distract from . . . It's still there. 

00:28:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. It's still there. 

00:28:20
CARRIE Yeah, (crosstalk)it's still there, so . . . 

00:28:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. Right. Right. So, something shifted for you after you had her (crosstalk)for a little while. Um, it almost sounds like, um, when I talk to, uh, new parents, (crosstalk)you know, and they talk about how exhausted they are . . . 

00:28:35
CARRIE (crosstalk)Mm. (crosstalk)I know. Yeah. 

00:28:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . and, you know, they didn't realize it was gonna be this hard or, you know, that they're gonna, um, be without so much sleep, you know, those kinds of things that are . . . 

00:28:40
CARRIE I completely understand. 

00:28:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. Um, but then the-, there's also that falling in love process, (crosstalk)you know, right? Um, and there was something then that shifted after a few months with her . . . 

00:28:55
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yes. Mm-hmm. 

00:28:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . um, and, um, how did you become a different, um, dog mom, for her after a few months you think? 

00:29:05
Folding and thickening of the identity story 

00:29:05
CARRIE I think . . . Well, I know, part of it wa- . . . You know, the dog's just, she's just happy to see me. 

00:29:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
CARRIE She's just . . . Anything I do for her . . . 

00:29:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
CARRIE . . . she's very grateful (crosstalk)when she sounds silly, but, when I um, when I come home, she's just the happiest thing on (crosstalk)the planet. (crosstalk)She's . . . So I think in her excitement to see me I learned to be excited to see her . . . 

00:29:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:30
CARRIE . . . and just, anything I do for her, I . . . She has joy. I mean, (crosstalk)I know she's my dog but she experiences joy and I want that for her. D-, does, (crosstalk)does that sound crazy? Okay, cuz I want her to even because she's my responsibility. i want her to experience happiness (crosstalk)and she gives me happiness so when I want her to have fun and I want her to play and . . . 

00:29:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:29:50
CARRIE . . . So . . . 

00:29:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:50
CARRIE In that way. 

00:29:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. If she could talk in, in people talk . . . I know that's . . . Okay, that, that might sound a little odd, but, but if, um, Emmy could talk in people talk what would she say that she, um, appreciates about you? 

00:30:05
A membership question using subjunctive possibilities 

00:30:05
CARRIE She would appreciate that I feed her, (crosstalk)for one. She'd appreciate that, um, I pick her up when she wants to be picked up. 

00:30:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:15
CARRIE I never would have thought a dog wanted to be picked up (crosstalk)and she does. Um, so I pick her up when she wants to be picked up. I let her lay down if she wants to lay down. I play with her . . . 

00:30:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:25
CARRIE . . . um, uh . . . I, I'm sure she would say, "Ball, ball, ball, ball, (inaudible ) ball, ball," cuz I (crosstalk)throw the ball a lot to her and she, and she's just excited about that. I think she would be appreciative that um, that I show her affection. 

00:30:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:40
CARRIE i think she's actually taught me to be . . . Well, in relationships I have with family and close friends, to . . . I've seen how other people are with other people more and I've seen how people are with their dogs and I have my friend that's a big dog lover . . . 

00:30:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:55
CARRIE . . . and I see how she interacts and that, I think that taught me a little bit more about (crosstalk)letting Emmy in because my mother brought me up with animals but she also brought me up . . . "These things could die." 

00:31:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:31:05
CARRIE So I don't really want to invest (crosstalk)too much in them and so, I, I've learned that, you know, they're around (crosstalk)so things die anyway, so you . . . It's okay to invest in them. I know that it's gonna hurt . . . 

00:31:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:31:20
CARRIE . . . when she passes (crosstalk)away . . . 

00:31:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:31:25
CARRIE . . . but um, better for her, that if I actually attach myself to her (crosstalk)which is huge for me I (crosstalk)think because I was kind of raised that there's like a cut-off point with . . . 

00:31:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:31:35
CARRIE . . . emotions, like you don't wanna get . . . So Emmy's kind of . . . As much as she is a dog she's been a learning relationship for me (crosstalk)I think, because . . . 

00:31:40
Another fold in the relational meaning 

00:31:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. So is this right Carrie, that, that um, Emmy has taught you that, in spite that, um, your relationships, um, change, and possibly the, um, uh, that includes death, that it . . . You can still commit and love in spite of that? Is that . . . 

00:32:05
CARRIE Yeah, I, I think . . . You know, I don't think about it. I don't think about that everyday (crosstalk)but in thinking about it m- . . . The relationship I have with Emmy . . . Yeah, I think that that's definitely could be said, (crosstalk)which is more profound than I would've my relationship with an animal could be, (crosstalk)if that makes sense. 

00:32:20
A surprise indicates generating new meaning 

00:32:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Has that been a surprise? To learn that (crosstalk)through . . . 

00:32:25
CARRIE (crosstalk)Today? Right now, yes. 

00:32:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Today, (crosstalk)um, a- . . . 

00:32:25
CARRIE . . . (crosstalk)because I hadn't thought about it (crosstalk)in those terms and I always say, you know, "She's a dog. I know she's a dog. I know (crosstalk)she's a dog. I know she's a dog." 

00:32:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay, okay. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:32:35
CARRIE I . . . Like, I get exc- . . . You know, give that qualifier to people . . . 

00:32:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Sure. 

00:32:40
CARRIE . . . but um . . . Yeah, I think that she's been a huge asset in, in me (crosstalk)at learning to make attachments, especially when I don't . . . I've had my heart broken to an extreme amount where I don't want to . . . 

00:32:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:32:55
CARRIE . . . so, you know, (crosstalk)in some weird way that's a little, nice progression I guess, (crosstalk)away from pain. Does that make sense? 

00:33:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:33:00
CARRIE It . . . 

00:33:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. 

00:33:05
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yeah? 

00:33:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. She's been an, um, teacher for in that (crosstalk)way. Is that right? 

00:33:05
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yes. Yes, and such a sweet one . . . 

00:33:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. 

00:33:10
CARRIE . . . you know? She ne-, she's never . . . I mean, I won't . . . She, she's a talker. She, like . . . 

00:33:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:33:15
CARRIE . . . growls and . . . 

00:33:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:33:15
CARRIE "Rrrrrrrrrrr," you know? She make all these sounds when I come home, like, "Where have you been?" (crosstalk)So I mean, she'll be vocal when she doesn't like something that I've done. I've just don't know what (crosstalk)it is that I've done. 

00:33:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right, right. Back to the, the pet store when she demanded (crosstalk)that you take her home. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah, she does. (crosstalk)She's interesting . . . (crosstalk)Her and her survival skills (crosstalk)I guess. 

00:33:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. She's very good. So what is it like talking about her now, with me? 

00:33:35
Folding the meaning by inquiring into immediate experience 

00:33:35
CARRIE Um, it's good, I, you know, again, I feel kind of silly sometimes (crosstalk)because she's a dog . . . 

00:33:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:33:45
CARRIE . . . but, um, I know that, in my struggles, she's, she is a place of happiness for me . . . 

00:33:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:33:50
CARRIE . . . so, I think in, in where I'm at, you know, talking about her is a good thing for me . . . 

00:33:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:34:00
CARRIE . . . I thought. 

00:34:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:34:00
CARRIE If that (crosstalk)answers what you'd said 

00:34:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, right. Yeah. But I was just thinking too, about how that "it's a dog" (crosstalk)kind of thing. I was thinking about, you know, um, are there places where at times you've felt, um, that you're not supposed to be as in love with . . . 

00:34:10
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:34:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. I-, is that right? 

00:34:15
CARRIE Absolutely. (crosstalk)Even saying "in love with" is pretty funny cuz I think the last couple . . . Well, I've been out of work cuz I'm on summer, winter break . . . 

00:34:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Right. 

00:34:25
CARRIE . . . um, so I'm not working and I've had some really horrendous struggles the last three weeks . . . 

00:34:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:34:30
CARRIE . . . and where I don't wanna go out, I don't wanna do (crosstalk)anything and this dog does whatever I wanna do you know? If I don't feel like leaving the couch she's staying with me on the couch. If . . . 

00:34:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:34:40
CARRIE . . . you know, I don't feel like doing much she's very present with me . . . 

00:34:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:34:45
CARRIE . . . and I've had people say, um, "Well you know, dogs know . . . 

00:34:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:34:45
CARRIE . . . and I'm not really sure, but I know that there's something she senses and she's with (crosstalk)me. Does that (crosstalk)make sense? 

00:34:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:34:55
CARRIE Where, you know, the last three weeks she's been with me everyday . . . 

00:35:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:00
CARRIE . . . no matter my mood, no (crosstalk)matter, you know, (crosstalk)what's difficult. 

00:35:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)So what has that meant for you, your last few weeks to have that devotion? 

00:35:05
Inquiring into personal meaning of the dog's actions 

00:35:10
CARRIE Um, it's very comforting. 

00:35:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:10
CARRIE It's very comforting. 

00:35:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:15
CARRIE Uh, and there were moments when I think, "Ugh, it can't just, you know . . . I wish there was more than the dog, (crosstalk)you know, helping me through this moment right now, but thank God I have the dog to help me through this moment right now and she doesn't care. She's just as close while I'm sad. 

00:35:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:30
CARRIE (crosstalk)Does that make sense? 

00:35:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:35:30
CARRIE Okay. Well, you know, sometimes, people get uncomfortable . . . 

00:35:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:35
CARRIE . . . in, in struggles . . . 

00:35:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:35
CARRIE . . . and so they back off (crosstalk)where they, like, act like it's not there. 

00:35:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:35:40
CARRIE Emmy's just . . . 

00:35:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Trying to make it better. 

00:35:45
CARRIE Yeah, she's just (crosstalk)gonna be close to me. She's not running from me. It's . . . And she'll check on me, (crosstalk)you know? 

00:35:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)And she's just there. Right, right. 

00:35:45
CARRIE Like, I would . . . And uh, I had taken a bath to kind of, which I haven't done in years, that I just needed to, like, debrief . . . 

00:35:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:35:55
CARRIE . . . um, and uh, she kept coming back in and checking on me like, "Are you okay?" and then (crosstalk)she'd leave real quick, so, you know, it's just interesting that . . . 

00:36:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, right. Mm-hmm. 

00:36:00
CARRIE . . . I know she cares . . . 

00:36:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:36:05
CARRIE . . . in those moments . . . 

00:36:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:36:05
CARRIE . . . so it's nice to know that even if she's "my dog . . . 

00:36:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:36:10
CARRIE . . . that she actually (crosstalk)cares whether or not (crosstalk)I'm okay. 

00:36:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. So even if (crosstalk)she's your dog, (crosstalk)she's still in that relational space with you. 

00:36:15
CARRIE (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. She is . . . 

00:36:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Is that right? 

00:36:15
CARRIE . . . which is weird to say out loud . . . 

00:36:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:36:15
CARRIE . . . you know, but . . . 

00:36:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

00:36:20
CARRIE . . . I, I definitely know that (crosstalk)she helps me so that's obviously a relationship. We take . . . (crosstalk)We look out for each other. We look out for each other. There's no doubt in my (crosstalk)mind, so . . . 

00:36:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:30
CARRIE That's good. That's nice to have, (crosstalk)yeah. She barks when I let her out of the car to warn everybody, "Back off! We're coming! And stay away from her!" 

00:36:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)That's nice to have. 

00:36:40
CARRIE So that part's always . . . 

00:36:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh-huh. 

00:36:40
CARRIE (crosstalk)I always laugh at that, cuz like . . . "I'm fine." 

00:36:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:36:40
CARRIE And I'll (crosstalk)say, "It's okay. It's momma," and she'll just like, go in. She's good, but, she always . . . She does look out for me, so that's nice. 

00:36:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)And hears it . . . She's been a nice teacher. 

00:36:50
CARRIE She has been. (crosstalk)It's interesting to hear it say that way cuz . . . Yeah. It's obviously she's taught me, but she's interesting. I should go home and thank her today. Oh my God. 

00:37:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. A dog bone would serve well. 

00:37:05
CARRIE Yeah. 

00:37:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. Okay. 

00:37:05
CARRIE (crosstalk)Yeah, so it's interesting. 

00:37:10
Disclosure of how the counselor is transported by the client's story... 

00:37:10
equalizes power between client and counselor 

00:37:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Would it be okay if we paused (crosstalk)our conversation here, um, um, and you know my, um, uh, preference in life is, is I love talking about dogs or cats or horses or anything, um, so it's always, um, welcome for me to hear about the relationship that, that you have with, with Emmy- May and, you know, I don't think of it as weird, (crosstalk)um, at all. I think it is absolutely fantastic, you know? Um, so it's really nice to share that with you. Um, (crosstalk)yeah. 

00:37:35
CARRIE (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Thank you. (crosstalk)Thank you. 

00:37:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Thank you Carrie. 

00:37:40
CARRIE (crosstalk)Makes me feel better that (crosstalk)I'm talking to you, so thank you. 

00:37:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:45
The Conversation 2: John and Laura 

00:37:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Okay. Hi Laura. 

00:37:55
LAURA Hi. 

00:38:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, thank you for being willing to be part of this today. 

00:38:00
LAURA Sure. 

00:38:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, and um, you know, we're here in this environment with, you know, camera and lights and that kind of makes it, uh . . . It's like the unusual experience that I'm imagining is not something you've done so often. Is that right or not? 

00:38:15
LAURA That's actually correct. I've . . . This is my first time. 

00:38:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Okay, okay. So, um, I appreciate it even more that you're willing to volunteer and put yourself into a, a new situation, (crosstalk)um, and, um, what we're doing is, um, creating little pieces of counseling practice exercises. 

00:38:35
LAURA (crosstalk)Yeah. Okay. 

00:38:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, rather than the whole conversation and in this, this um, exchange what we wanna do is to just demonstrate the principal of curious questioning because, um, I believe that, that, um, becoming a good counselor i-, isn't one of the things it involves is developing the art of being able to ask useful questions. Not just any questions, but the most useful ones. 

00:39:00
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:39:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So in order to demonstrate that I wanna ask you just about a topic that is completely ordinary that doesn't have any problem associated with it. (crosstalk)Is that okay? 

00:39:10
LAURA (crosstalk)Okay. That's fine. 

00:39:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Okay, so what I'm gonna ask you about is the topic of breakfast . . . 

00:39:15
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:39:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and we . . . I don't know where this conversation's gonna go and probably you don't either. 

00:39:20
LAURA I don't. I do not have a clue but . . . 

00:39:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Okay, but I'm, I'm interested to find out. 

00:39:25
LAURA Okay. 

00:39:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So, when I use the word "breakfast," what came to your mind? 

00:39:30
LAURA Um . . . "Food. Yum." (crosstalk)I enjoy food. 

00:39:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)"Food. Yum." So the word "breakfast" has enjoyable . . . 

00:39:35
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . um, sort of connotations for you? 

00:39:40
Picking up on resonant words 

00:39:40
LAURA Enjoyable and energy. I definitely need, um, feel like I need something in the morning to sustain me for the day. 

00:39:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. To kind of build up your (crosstalk)energy and get you through the day? 

00:39:50
LAURA (crosstalk)Exactly. Mm-hmm. 

00:39:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm, so those are two kind of, quite, um, you know, positive connotations, which may not be the same for everybody (crosstalk)right? They, um . . . And so tell me about those. Are they . . . Has it always been like that for you? That kind of sense of enjoyment and energy that goes (crosstalk)with the, the concept of breakfast? 

00:40:10
Exploring history of the resonance 

00:40:10
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm. I think so, yeah. Um, I've always grown up where my Dad's always, like, made these incredibly large breakfast and (crosstalk)so I enjoy breakfast. Mm-hmm. 

00:40:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Oh really? So . . . "Incredibly large (crosstalk)breakfasts" . . . 

00:40:25
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Like, sides and everything, so . . . 

00:40:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Oh okay, (crosstalk)okay. Yeah, so like . . . Well, what? Like, what sort of (crosstalk)breakfast have you eaten in your life? 

00:40:35
Resonance has cultural components 

00:40:35
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Um . . . Oh, when I was younger, uh, my Dad would make, like, an egg and then he would make beans, and like, chilaquiles (crosstalk)and, um, maybe like bacon or sausage or something so . . . 

00:40:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. 

00:40:45
LAURA . . . and like a tortilla to like, scoop all that yumminess with the egg yolk running all over my food so . . . 

00:40:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. I can just about taste it (crosstalk)as you describes . . . 

00:40:55
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's . . . Yes. It's true. 

00:41:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Is it like that for you too? 

00:41:00
LAURA Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:41:00
Joining the resonance produces empathy 

00:41:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So . . . And it was your Dad who made these? 

00:41:05
LAURA Normally, yeah. It was typically my Dad. He's um, really the main, um, one in our family who cooks. (crosstalk)My Mom would cook every once in a while but my Dad was the main. 

00:41:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. He was the main breakfast cooker? 

00:41:20
LAURA Mm, yeah. Breakfast, (crosstalk)lunch and . . . Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)And all the other meals too? Okay. And so, I'm, I'm . . . What I'm kind of learning is a little bit of a picture of what breakfast was like for you when you (crosstalk)were younger and, (crosstalk)and the kind of memories that you have at . . . Large meals . . . 

00:41:30
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Large meals. Mm-hmm. 

00:41:30
The counselor's task is to learn about the client's world 

00:41:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Um, you know, all of, all these, all the different, um, foods that would (crosstalk)go into it and your Dad's cooking and . . . Kind of like a family environment. Were there other fe-, members of your family? 

00:41:45
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, at the time, my brother, um . . . He would cook for my brother and myself, (crosstalk)um, so yeah. 

00:41:50
Inquiring into the relational context 

00:41:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, okay. And so as you've grown and, and, um, you know . . . I presume that you're not living with your Dad anymore. 

00:42:00
LAURA No, I'm not. 

00:42:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So, like what . . . How has breakfast evolved in your life since those early days? 

00:42:10
Exploring more recent history 

00:42:10
LAURA S- . . . Um, now breakfast is kind of on the run. Um, (crosstalk)sometimes I'll have like a bowl of cereal in the morning or, like this morning, I had to stop at Del Taco and have a, um, breakfast burrito, like with eggs and cheese (crosstalk)so . . . It's (crosstalk)on the run. 

00:42:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Okay, yeah. So it's on the run . . . 

00:42:25
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:42:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. It's kind of . . . Life has changed and the (crosstalk)patterns of life have changed a little bit. Is that right? (crosstalk)Yeah. And is there any sense in which, um, you carry anything through that is still similar despite the changes that have happened? 

00:42:40
Inquiring into the sense of continuity between the past and the present 

00:42:40
LAURA (crosstalk)Exactly, exactly. (crosstalk)Yes. Um, for my kids, yes. I do make sure that um, I do provide them, at least, with something to eat. Um, I don't make the large meals just because of time. Um, just because of the crazy, you know, scheduling right now (crosstalk)in my life with s-, managing school work . . . Everything like that. 

00:43:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Yes, yes. 

00:43:05
LAURA Eventually I wanna get back to that and provide that same kind of, um, create that same kind of environment that my Dad created for me because I loved it. 

00:43:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So, somethi- . . . There's something there that's important to you? 

00:43:15
LAURA Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:43:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right? Tell me about that. What i-, what i-, what is it that's important to you to provide for your children that . . . 

00:43:20
Broadening the context of the story in action 

00:43:20
LAURA I like the idea of um, family and eating meals at a table and I just like . . . My husband has a saying where food brings people together. 

00:43:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Food brings (crosstalk)people together? Yes. 

00:43:30
A resonant statement of a cherished meaning 

00:43:30
LAURA (crosstalk)Yeah, and I really believe it does, you know? So creating, you know, that . . . I don't know. I just . . . Uh, it creates conversations, uh, you (crosstalk)know, it just brings up good feelings. 

00:43:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Yeah. Is that something that you and your husband have talked about? 

00:43:45
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:43:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yeah? 

00:43:45
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:43:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And what sort of conversations have you had about, about that? 

00:43:50
LAURA Um, just . . . You know, like . . . Well, with our current situation we live in a really small space. 

00:44:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yes. 

00:44:00
LAURA Um, just circumstantial I guess. (crosstalk)It's the point in life where we're at right now. Um, but we talk about the future when we're able to like, afford, you know, a, a larger house and space for our children and be able to sit down at a table. We don't even have a dining room table cuz it wouldn't fit in our place. It's (crosstalk)so tiny, but we wanna create that, um, you know, lifestyle for our children and we wanna give those memories to them. 

00:44:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. (crosstalk)Right, okay, okay. So you, you ha- . . . It's like you have an image of the kind of provision you would like to make for your children's lives. 

00:44:35
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:44:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Even just through how you give them breakfast. (crosstalk)Is that right? Yeah. So, tell me about how that fits into the vision of what you want to give to your children in a, in a larger sense. 

00:44:45
Expanding the significance of preferred values 

00:44:45
LAURA (crosstalk)Exactly, yeah. Um, I'm kind of stumped with the question. Is there another angle maybe you can (crosstalk)word it or . . . 

00:44:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, well I, well I had a sense that . . . 

00:44:55
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:44:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . when you were saying that, that it, that wasn't just about the kind of breakfast you wanted to give your children. It was about a lifestyle you (crosstalk)wanted to give them . . . 

00:45:00
LAURA (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:45:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and, and I'm wondering whether the, the, the breakfast is sort of fits (crosstalk)into a, a slightly larger picture of what you're wanting to offer your children by way of, you know, the parenting that you, (crosstalk)you think is important and, (crosstalk)and so on. 

00:45:15
LAURA (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. Got it. Okay. So I just . . . I feel like family is just really important. I feel like giving quality time to my children is really important. 

00:45:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:45:25
LAURA I consider my, myself and my husband especially too . . . We're very hands-on parents. 

00:45:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. "Hands-on parents." 

00:45:30
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. What does that mean? 

00:45:35
Inquiring into a resonant phrase 

00:45:35
LAURA "Hands-on parent" is just that we're involved in their activities, we're (crosstalk)involved in their lives, you know, um, we're both very attentive to them, both very nurturing to them . . . 

00:45:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Yes. 

00:45:45
LAURA . . . Um, and I like that. I really, you know, like that I can give those values . . . I don't know if you wanna call them values (crosstalk)too, and characteristics; traits I guess, to (crosstalk)my children. 

00:45:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)So, so when you say "values" . . . I'm interested in what you mean, like what kind of values are you speaking of? Um . . . 

00:46:05
LAURA Like nurturing, like (crosstalk)being . . . 

00:46:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Nurturing, being attentive . . . Those ones. Is that what you mean? 

00:46:05
LAURA Yes, um, being attentive to them because I know that if we are attentive to them and, and, you know, show them like through our actions, consideration, and, you know, for other people . . . 

00:46:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:46:15
LAURA . . . that they'll carry those over to so-, into society (crosstalk)and that's important for me to, you know, not just have children just to have children but have children to, you know, contribute to a larger, um, I guess, spectrum. 

00:46:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. So, like, I'm interested in why that's important? 

00:46:35
The client is the expert on significance 

00:46:35
LAURA I, I guess it goes back to my Dad, my Father. I mean, um, he's just been like an incredible role-model in my life. I think, um, back to like the stories he would share of his upbringing and, you know, the hardships and, um, you know, uh, and the values he instilled, you know, (crosstalk)in, in my character, like the work ethics and, um, the ability to make sacrifices for, like, the larger, or the future, the larger overwhel-, the overall picture. 

00:47:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Okay. Yeah. So as you, as you think about breakfast it fits into this larger picture of (crosstalk)yourself as a parent . . . 

00:47:20
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:47:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and then into a larger picture again of . . . 

00:47:25
LAURA Society. 

00:47:25
Exploring cultural and relational dimensions of the topic 

00:47:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . society and wanting to live life in a way that is not just (crosstalk)selfish but actually contributing to society, is it? 

00:47:30
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yep. 

00:47:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And it connects too with something that you appreciate about your Dad and what's happened in his life . . . 

00:47:35
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and how he's kind of stood for certain values? 

00:47:40
LAURA Yeah. 

00:47:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Is that right? 

00:47:40
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm. 

00:47:45
LAURA Yeah. 

00:47:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So what's it like to actually, sort of, talk about all those things and (crosstalk)see them . . . 

00:47:50
LAURA (crosstalk)It's amazing. I mean, I kind of like makes me emotional. It's really (crosstalk)amazing because . . . Yeah. 

00:47:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Really? What sort of emotion is it? That kind of . . . 

00:47:55
LAURA Like . . . 

00:47:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . affects you? 

00:47:55
Folding meanings into the present moment 

00:48:00
LAURA It's just a really good feeling. I'm just really grateful to have had, um, you know, that figure in my life . . . 

00:48:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yes. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:48:05
Seeking the specific emotional experience 

00:48:05
LAURA . . . (crosstalk)you know, to model after and to, you know. 

00:48:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So that the . . . It's a kind of a, a gratitude a (crosstalk)sense of, of, of pleasure (crosstalk)at noticing . . . Of pride? 

00:48:20
Folding the meaning back on itself thickens the story 

00:48:20
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)It's a sense of pride too. Yeah, like I'm proud that, to say that I've ha- . . . You know, that that's my Dad and that's . . . 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yes. 

00:48:25
LAURA . . . you know, those are the values that I instill, you know, uh, because of, you know, who he was and what he (crosstalk)stood for. 

00:48:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Yeah. Mm. So how are those values being expressed in your life as well as at breakfast time with your children? I mean I'm wondering whether they, they go, whether they spread into other domains or they kind of filter out into other aspects of your life? 

00:48:50
LAURA Um, yeah, I've definitely, I guess um . . . I would say that just, you know, actually even being here (crosstalk)I think, um, that was, you know, I wanted to gain, um, some kind of experience and develop some kind of tools that I believe are going to carry over into any, you know, people that uh, whose lives I might, you know, um, affect or . . . 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Yes. 

00:49:15
LAURA . . . impact I guess. 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yes. 

00:49:15
Linking examples to a story of identity 

00:49:15
LAURA Um, and in second part, um, just because of what someone else who's viewing this can learn and the skills that they can acquire for their own, like, I guess, little bag of tools . . . 

00:49:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yes. (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:49:35
LAURA (crosstalk)Um . . . 

00:49:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So that, like, that, that was quite intentional on your (crosstalk)part, to actually, um, you know, offer something . . . 

00:49:40
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:49:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and it kind of connects with those values and with um, (crosstalk)what do you hold to be important in (crosstalk)life and . . . 

00:49:50
LAURA (crosstalk)Yep. (crosstalk)Yeah. I just feel like I was just . . . I mean, like my purpose . . . I guess we all feel like we have a purpose and my purpose is to just give myself, you know, uh, um, in a positive way whenever I can . . . 

00:50:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:50:05
LAURA . . . to whomever, like whose evers lives I'm meant to impact or (crosstalk)be a part of for whatever amount of time. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. Oh. You know . . . And well I've got bun-, a whole bunch of questions in my head about that if (crosstalk)you don't mind. Um, one of them is, kind of like, um, how do you formulate that as a kind of a, a belief cuz I'm imagining that there's kind of things that come behind that for you that, um, the sets of, of principles and values and (crosstalk)beliefs and hopes and dreams for life (crosstalk)and things like that. 

00:50:35
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, no, it's okay. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)I think it's just like my past and what I've experienced. (crosstalk)I think it's, um, there's been both good and bad . . . 

00:50:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Yes. 

00:50:45
LAURA . . . so I guess I know that I don't like the bad. I didn't like to experience that and I know if I can impact somebody else's life and, you know, I know that I like humble people. I know that I like, um, you know, I gravitate to people who can see the good in others. (crosstalk)Um, and I, I guess . . . I don't know. I guess it's more exp-, e-, e-, the experience that I went through . . . 

00:51:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes. Right. (crosstalk)Okay. Of seeing the, the contrast between . . . 

00:51:15
LAURA . . .(crosstalk)that molded this. Mm-hmm. 

00:51:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . good and bad, or between values that you, (crosstalk)uh . . . Or the expression of values that you agree with and the ones you don't agree with, (crosstalk)right? 

00:51:20
LAURA (crosstalk)Didn't agree with. (crosstalk)Right, right. 

00:51:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm, and I'm imagining - and I won't, I won't go into it right now, but I'm imagining if I was to ask you, you could tell me some stories about (crosstalk)those differences, right? 

00:51:30
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:51:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And they, are they uh, sort of in your mind as you think about it? 

00:51:35
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm. 

00:51:35
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And where do you hope that this, these values might lead you? 

00:51:35
Asking about future developments on the landscape of action 

00:51:40
LAURA I don't know. I don't . . . I mean, eh, there's so many possibilities. (crosstalk)I mean I have these ideas that I've thought of but I just . . . Ultimately I think it's gonna lead to goodness . . . 

00:51:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Okay. (crosstalk)Mm. 

00:51:55
LAURA . . . (crosstalk)and that's what I hope for. 

00:51:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And right now you're kind of expressing those values in, it sounds like little kind of ways with your own family (crosstalk)or not-so-little kind of ways with your own family . . . 

00:52:05
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:52:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and in your, um, and other things as well? 

00:52:15
LAURA Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:52:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)And being here today? 

00:52:15
LAURA Exactly. 

00:52:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Yeah. 

00:52:15
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:52:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And then your, your studies and your work (crosstalk)and things like that? 

00:52:20
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. (crosstalk)School I guess. Um, work. 

00:52:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm. Yeah. 

00:52:25
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:52:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. We're gonna pause for this conversation's uh, (crosstalk)I'm . . . I think we've kind of done what we were setting out to do. Before we pause . . . 

00:52:35
LAURA (crosstalk)Okay. Mm-hmm. 

00:52:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . I'd like to, uh, just ask what your experiences of, of me asking you about some of these things. What's it, what's it like? 

00:52:45
Externalized language to inquire into best self possible 

00:52:45
LAURA Um, I think it's been nice to share . . . 

00:52:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

00:52:50
LAURA . . . um, pieces of, of me, just from one question. I, I think (crosstalk)it's amazing how like one conversational theme can go in so many different directions. 

00:53:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:53:05
LAURA (crosstalk)Um . . . 

00:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Has it been kind of surprising, where it went (crosstalk)or . . . I have no idea where it was gonna go to but I'm appreciating kind of hearing the things that you're, you're telling me about from, you know, one (crosstalk)simple beginning. (crosstalk)Um, and it's been nice in, in the sense of what? Like when you said the word "nice" . . . I'm interested to know more about what that, what that (crosstalk)means. 

00:53:25
LAURA (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Well because it, it kind of takes me back in time, um, but it also kind of takes me forward in time with my own children. It takes me back in (crosstalk)time because I brought up my Dad and my, um, the different memories, (crosstalk)or a few of the different memories and then it takes me forward with my children and what I can with memories that I can create with them, the possibilities. 

00:53:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right, right. Mm-hmm. Is that like it creates . . . Talking about these things creates a sense of movement of life through (crosstalk)time, you know, from the past through the present and into (crosstalk)the future? Um, you get kind of a sense of that? Mm. 

00:54:00
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yep. 

00:54:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm. Has it felt okay for me to ask you these things? 

00:54:10
LAURA Mm-hmm. 

00:54:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Hasn't felt intrusive or anything? 

00:54:10
LAURA No, no. Not at all. (crosstalk)Mm, I think I, I think it's just the manner in how you do it. It's more curious. It's not, um . . . I don't know. I can't think of the word. 

00:54:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Okay. But it . . . Well, I mean, the word I used was "intrusive" but that may not be the right one but . . . 

00:54:30
LAURA Well, no, not . . . I don't know. It . . . (crosstalk)I'm sure it'll come to me later 

00:54:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm. Okay, okay. Yeah. Well I appreciate, Laura, you um, telling me about the, the connections between breakfast and important values in your life and important things that, uh, fit with who you are and who you're trying to be in the world (crosstalk)and, and, the people who are part of that for you, that are kind of family members, and uh, the um, the um, traditions and experiences that you and the stories that go with that for you so . . . 

00:55:05
LAURA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:55:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . Thank you very much. 

00:55:05

LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Tell me about a time, Charlotte, that um, you're pleased about in your life or a time that perhaps you stood up for yourself or something.

CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)It happened a week before Christmas, (crosstalk)um . . . Just give you a little background, (crosstalk)um, uh, back in '97 our family moved to Reno, Nevada . . . 

00:56:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:56:05
CHARLOTTE . . . and um, at that time we were still married. Um, and um, things didn't work out and so I divorced and moved back to (crosstalk)Southern California in '05. 

00:56:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:56:10
CHARLOTTE But um, the children have been, uh, diff- . . . My children are grown. They've been in all different areas. (crosstalk)One's been in Buffalo, New York. Another one with me in Southern (ph)cow and the other one's my, uh, daughter stayed in Reno, so this Christmas I decided, this holiday, I said it: "Let's a-, all . . . I wanna see all my children together." 

00:56:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
CHARLOTTE So the only way to do that was that I had to drive to Reno . . . 

00:56:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh-huh. 

00:56:35
CHARLOTTE . . . with my son that's here in (crosstalk)California with me and we went through fourteen m-, miles of snow and (crosstalk)whatever to get there but nothing was gonna stop me. I was determined to get us together. And then my ex-husband says, "Well, why don't you all come to my house for dinner on (crosstalk)when you arrive, the night you arrive and I'm going, "Kidding me?!" (crosstalk)It's like, I didn't expect to see him . . . 

00:56:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right. Right, right. 

00:56:55
CHARLOTTE . . . because I just expected to see my children. We were gonna go over my daughter's house (crosstalk)who lives in Reno . . . 

00:57:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:57:00
CHARLOTTE . . . and my son who lives in Buffalo, he goes to Buffalo State University, was gonna fly in (crosstalk)the, the day before and we were all gonna get together at my daughter's house. 

00:57:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Mm-hmm. 

00:57:10
CHARLOTTE So, I did. (crosstalk)I went over to my ex-husband's house and (crosstalk)he cooked spaghetti, which was my recipe, you know, it was good. 

00:57:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:57:20
CHARLOTTE And I was just really pleased. The children were a little nervous. (crosstalk)They thought that, um, you know, I wouldn't be able to handle it (crosstalk)because they know how, how difficult (crosstalk)it's been for me these past five years. 

00:57:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm. 

00:57:30

You don't want everybody to know about it. (crosstalk)Yeah but I'm glad I did it (crosstalk)and I want to share. 

01:08:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Mm. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so for other people who have, um, former spouses . . . 

01:08:35
CHARLOTTE Mm-hmm. 

01:08:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . um, you know, um, if you were to give them some words of wisdom, um, what kind of advice might you give them? 

01:08:40
Invoking a wider audience of witnesses to identity change 

01:08:40
CHARLOTTE Oh my goodness, wo-, words of wisdom from me? (crosstalk)You know, from . . . Give it time, (crosstalk)you know, just . . . Time heals everything (crosstalk)and if you need to get help, get help. (crosstalk)I don't, I don't think I could've done it if I hadn't (crosstalk)gotten the (crosstalk)counseling. (crosstalk)Yeah. I'm str-, sure of it. 

01:09:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm.

01:09:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

01:09:05
CHARLOTTE I would never be at . . . Uh, again, I wouldn't be at the place I was when we, when we had the dinner. 

01:09:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. 

01:09:10
CHARLOTTE . . . if I hadn't gone (crosstalk)for counseling and given it some time . . . 

01:09:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 

01:09:10
CHARLOTTE . . . and some thought (crosstalk)and put aside a lot of things that . . . 

01:09:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Right. 

01:09:15
CHARLOTTE . . . don't matter anymore, (crosstalk)you know?

LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. If you . . . Can I pick up on one other thing that, that you said, um, previously? Eh, eh . . . It may or may not ha-, be important to you. Your spaghetti recipe? 

01:09:30
CHARLOTTE Mm-hmm. 

01:09:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Uh-huh. Did you know that he was using it all these years? 

01:09:35

LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Did it? Yeah? And (crosstalk)what wa-, your . . . 

01:09:45
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)Actually, it's not my recipe. (crosstalk)It's my Mom's recipe. 

01:09:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)I- . . . Mm-hmm. 

01:09:45
CHARLOTTE So he didn't . . . He doesn't . . . You know, he thinks . . . Yeah, we don't . . . As women we don't tell men a lot of things we cook . . . 

01:09:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:09:50
CHARLOTTE . . . that we got it from whoever, (crosstalk)but, you know, I just . . . Cuz my mother cooked it that way . . . 

01:09:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Mm-hmm. 

01:09:55
CHARLOTTE . . . and so that's how he, he liked it. 

01:10:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So . . . And what was that like for you, (crosstalk)when you went and said, "Oh. I know this taste of this."? 

01:10:00
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)Oh, i- . . . I-, it was liked I cooked it. (crosstalk)It wasn't . . . It was hilarious, (crosstalk)you know? I didn't say . . . I did tell him. (crosstalk)I said, "Oh, that . . . You used my recipe, (crosstalk)huh?" and he just kind of laughed a (crosstalk)little bit. He said, "You like it?" I said, (crosstalk)"Yeah. It's good." 

01:10:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Was it? (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

01:10:15
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:10:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have like . . . Do you like places where you influenced him? 

01:10:20
CHARLOTTE Oh my God, I'm all in the house. It's (crosstalk)ea- . . . That's a whole different . . . You wanna go there? 

01:10:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. Mm. 

01:10:25
CHARLOTTE I'm all through the house (crosstalk)there. 

01:10:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, is it the same house that you lived in (crosstalk)with him? 

01:10:25
CHARLOTTE No. 

01:10:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)No, no, okay. 

01:10:25
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)He bought another house after, after the divorce. Um, when I say I'm all through the house . . . He kept a lot of things . . . 

01:10:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:10:30
CHARLOTTE . . . that like, where I didn't, (crosstalk)you know, I . . . Although we . . . You know how divorces are. You split things . . . 

01:10:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh-huh. 

01:10:40
CHARLOTTE . . . and you take this (crosstalk)and you take that . . . 

01:10:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

01:10:40
CHARLOTTE I don't know if you know (crosstalk)but that's how it goes. Um, he kept all the little, you know, we call them "dust collectors" . . . 

01:10:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:10:50
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)You know, (crosstalk)things that he put . . . I'll give you an example like, you know, um, in the kitchen you have this recess area (crosstalk)of the cabinetry and you can put little collector things . . . 

01:11:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:11:00
CHARLOTTE Kept everything (crosstalk)and put things like I used to do (crosstalk)on top. 

01:11:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:11:05
CHARLOTTE I have to share one particular thing he kept. Uh, um, I'm update myself and I'm not . . . I don't care. Um, back in the late 70s, early 80s, used to be this wine bottle (crosstalk)that you could get and it had this spout . . . 

01:11:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:11:15
CHARLOTTE . . . and had this little ice area where you could put ice in it (crosstalk)and kept the wine cooler. (crosstalk)Now you probably wouldn't know what I'm talking about. You don't know. No. But anyway he had that. 

01:11:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right, right. Mm. 

01:11:25
CHARLOTTE He kept that and he used . . . We used to drink from that together. 

01:11:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. So, some playfulness, um, kind of exchanges between you and him, um, and ultimately, that you came away with that sensation of feeling pleased with yourself? 

01:11:40
CHARLOTTE Yeah. (crosstalk)I felt really good, you know? 

01:11:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Okay. 

01:11:45
CHARLOTTE That was a good place; (crosstalk)going and coming. 

01:11:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)It was a good place? Going and coming? (crosstalk)Yeah, even with driving through the snow? 

01:11:50
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Fourteen miles of chains . . . 

01:11:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Okay. Yeah (crosstalk)I'm telling you. (crosstalk)Yeah, I know. It's been bad. That's right. 

01:11:55
CHARLOTTE . . . (crosstalk)on Interstate 80. A lot of snow . . . It was no joke. Yeah. Yeah, but it was worth it. 

01:12:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. It was? 

01:12:00
CHARLOTTE Yeah. (crosstalk)I couldn't wait to get there. 

01:12:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:12:00
CHARLOTTE Yeah. 

01:12:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So is this a okay place for us to stop, um, our conversation right now? Is that all right? 

01:12:10
CHARLOTTE Yeah, it's good. 

01:12:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, thank you for telling me about that (crosstalk)story and telling me about a time that, um, you felt pleased with yourself, (crosstalk)um, and a time that your kids really saw the love and the strength, um, coming through you. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Thanks Charlotte. 

01:12:25
CHARLOTTE (crosstalk)Welcome. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)You're welcome. Mm-kay. 

01:12:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Okay. 

01:12:30
[sil.] 

01:12:30
Debriefing of the Session 

01:12:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. So Lorraine, I'm interested in what you're saying to yourself after talking to Charlotte about that conversation. 

01:12:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. I, I, I was actually really, um, tickled, hearing Charlotte's story cuz I was thinking about how, um . . . Well I was thinking about a lot of different things about what, um, a mother would do out of love . . . 

01:13:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:13:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . and I was thinking about the stories of strength and, and really admiring Charlotte's ability to, um, um, be in that place, uh, um, and accept her, um, husband, ex-husband's offering of kind of the olive branch of the spaghetti dinner . . . 

01:13:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:13:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . and, I mean, was imagining there was a lot of other things that I was curious about that I wanted to hear about, (crosstalk)you know, like I was thinking about um, how it was that she was able to hea-, hear his invitation and how it was she was able to accept, um, (crosstalk)that invitation and not reject it like she might have done previously. (crosstalk)Um . . . 

01:13:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm. (crosstalk)So you're left with various questions that you could have asked and could have explored further avenues of (crosstalk)inquiry that you could've gone down? 

01:13:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

01:13:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And you're also left with a place of admiring? 

01:13:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yes. 

01:13:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm- (crosstalk)hmm, is that important, you think? That, as a counselor that you get a, an opportunity to admire something in your, your person (crosstalk)you're talking to? 

01:13:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)That would be correct. (crosstalk)Definitely, uh, definitely. Um, because it tells me I'm doing, um, I think, a better job as a counselor, um, because I'm accessing those stories of strength, accessing the stories that, that the client may not have another venue for, (crosstalk)um, I'm not asking them to dive deep into the stories of pain and suffering . . . 

01:14:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:14:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . um, I was not interested in this context of a hearing a story about, you know, how painful her divorce was or why she chose to leave her ex-, um, husband, but was more interested in those stories of resiliency about where, um, five years have ended up. 

01:14:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:14:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Um, so that gives a place to say, "My goodness, there's been a huge change in five years and let's, you know, have a moment to take pause and notice that and honor that and (crosstalk)celebrate it. 

01:14:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm. I'm conscious of that being a, a place of difference in narrative practice from some other (crosstalk)approaches to counseling, right? 

01:14:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Sure. Yes. 

01:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. And I'm wondering if you could articulate what that place of difference is. 

01:15:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Um, uh, I think, for me the, those differences are around, um, whether or not we want to speak to, um, stories of pathology, um, and deficit, uh, and um, always speaking about struggle or, you know, left over business or places of pain, um, in a conventional psychological approach (crosstalk)compared to looking at, um, uh, what are the stories often times that get marginalized as stories of, um, um, exception stories (crosstalk)and that those would be the stories of strength, of the stories of resistance, those are the stories of resilience . . . 

01:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:15:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . um, and they, um, get left out, often times and I, I actually think those stories are more important. 

01:15:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:15:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Um, life is hard enough and has enough, um, challenges and enough difficulties and, um, counseling, traditionally I think, at times has, have made that worse or have magnified difficulties. Um, and so the kind of counseling conversation that I feel that it's a ethical responsibility to engage in is one that highlights, um, the stories of resilience and, um, highlights the stories of resistance and the stories of strength and agency and (crosstalk)Charlotte's . . . And possibility and options and opportunity, um, and hope, um, and Charlotte's, um, example was, um, perfect to that, (crosstalk)you know? 

01:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)And possibility and, you know, yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. So as a teacher, what would you want students to take from watching this particular (crosstalk)conversation? 

01:16:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. I would h-, hope that students would be able to hear that we don't have to sit down to a counseling conversation that says that, that the starting point is, "Tell me about a problem in your life." 

01:16:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:16:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right? Cuz that takes you down that pathway (crosstalk)and . . . 

01:16:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Cuz you didn't really talk about a problem at all . . . 

01:17:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. No, I (crosstalk)actually . . . My lead-off question was, "Tell me something you're pleased about." 

01:17:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . (crosstalk)in that conversation. Right. 

01:17:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Um, and that, that unfolded, then, this lovely little conversation that does have therapeutic implication. 

01:17:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:17:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. You know? And that it, it shows the demarcation of time . . . 

01:17:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:17:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . um, the, um, experience of change, the appea-, the experience of Charlotte, um, putting energy into creating positive outcome in her life. 

01:17:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:17:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Um, so it has therapeutic implication, (crosstalk)um, but it starts from a point of strength and continues to build on that strength. 

01:17:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm. 

01:17:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. So I hope that students would hear that. That, that, that, I think, is a more palatable place, uh, starting place for a much more successful ending place in a (crosstalk)counseling conversation. 

01:17:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm. I was hearing it as an example of something that I would want students to practice, (crosstalk)um, which is that, you know, very often in training context, people learn to do, to do the starting part of a conversation with clients . . . 

01:18:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:18:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . that is the, the problem exploration . . . 

01:18:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

01:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . and don't often get to practice the other part, which is the, um, the exploration of resilience and resistance and the counter- story . . . 

01:18:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

01:18:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . (crosstalk)and this is uh, I think, something that can't be replicated in class where people can do it, this, as an exercise to (crosstalk)start with something that you're pleased about . . . 

01:18:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Right, right. Right. 

01:18:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . rather than to start with a problem and then eventually get to the point that you're, (crosstalk)there's something you're pleased about later on in the (crosstalk)conversation if you in fact, ever (crosstalk)get there. 

01:18:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Sure. (crosstalk)Sure. (crosstalk)Yeah, a-, a-, I was actually just gonna say that. In both, in, uh, school counseling context, sometimes the counseling conversations, um, are very short. 

01:18:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:18:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. I mean, you might have meaningful conversation with somebody for ten minutes, um, in passing period, um, and so we need to be able to access quickly those stories of strength, and if you only start with, you know, "Tell me about a problem," you will never get to those (crosstalk)helpful, unique stories. (crosstalk)The yet . . . 

01:19:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yes, mm. (crosstalk)So in those five minute conversations that you have with people this is a great starting place. 

01:19:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah, and it's critical, (crosstalk)and it's critical, um, because you, you don't have time to, um, uh, uh, go back and, and pick that up a lot of times, um, and the other place I was thinking is that there's many clients i-, i-, where we're not working in a school setting, um, that would maybe working in health care setting or a private setting where you, you may only see a client one time . . . 

01:19:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:19:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. . . . and if you're only exploring a problem story they leave the session feeling worse than when they came in, often times. (crosstalk)Um, and again, so I think it's a, uh, position of ethical responsibility, as a counselor, to inflict kind of (crosstalk)pain on (inaudible ) 

01:19:38
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Which doesn't mean that you're trying to deny the problem or (crosstalk)deny any problem (crosstalk)stories or not even give space to them sometimes . . . 

01:19:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, no. (crosstalk)No. Sure. 

01:19:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . but that's not the only thing . . . 

01:19:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Right. 

01:19:45
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . that needs, needs opportunity (crosstalk)to be explored, you know. 

01:19:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, right, right, cuz I didn't want to deny that, that, um, Charlotte, um, had, at one time, a difficult connection with her ex-husband . . . 

01:19:55
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

01:19:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right? And that is not unusual, (crosstalk)um, for a person to experience that and so, um . . . But that is not the only story that's existing and she told, you know, these lovely examples of how that relationship has changed over time. 

01:20:10
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm. I was hearing too, the practice of double-listening . . . 

01:20:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yes. 

01:20:15
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . that you were loo-, um, consciously acknowledging the . . . And deliberately acknowledging the power of what had been a problem . . . 

01:20:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:20:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . had been problematic (crosstalk)for Charlotte, but were, were focusing on the other side of the coin, (crosstalk)um, the story of, as you said, resilience, resistance, a counter-story . . . 

01:20:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, right. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

01:20:35
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . a story of (crosstalk)possibility, the opening, the flowering of this new possibility. 

01:20:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. 

01:20:40
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:20:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. Was there one thing in particular that stood out as an, as an example of double-listening so people will understand that? 

01:20:50
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. Um, I can't think of one off-hand. It was the whole conversation if you like, actually. 

01:20:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. The whole conversation was a double-listen? (crosstalk)Yeah, right, right. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:21:00
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm. Anything else you want to say about that before we pause? 

01:21:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. No, no, I think, I think that, that does it justice. (crosstalk)It was a, uh, a, um, nice example, um, that Charlotte provided of, um, uh, where you can have a rich conversation, (crosstalk)um, starting from a positive place. (crosstalk)Mm. 

01:21:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)I certainly had a sense of richness . . . 

01:21:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. 

01:21:20
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. . . . that was resonating in me as I listened. 

01:21:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah, me too. Yeah. 

01:21:25
JOHN WINSLADE PH.D. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Thank you. 

01:21:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE PH.D. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.
