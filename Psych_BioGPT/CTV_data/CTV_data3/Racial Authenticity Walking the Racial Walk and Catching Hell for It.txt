DR. CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I am so glad to be here, to talk to you about this topic that is near and dear to my heart. You know, uh this topic uh, in normal classrooms, and I always consider my classroom not to be normal, or in my talks around the nation, not to be normal talks. This might be controversial. I don’t think it is, imagine if you will, you grow up, go into the playground to have a great day playing ball, on the seesaw, on the jungle gym, whatever you want to do. And because you know, that your sensitive to heat, the sun might have baked that iron bar really, really hot, or the sun might have baked those plastic slides really, really hot, you kinda wonder if you’re going to go on the slide or even attempt to play out in that hot sun. But think about this, as your trying to figure all that out, other people are looking at you, and wondering why don’t you just play why don’t you have a good time, like everybody else is doing? Well, that is nowhere near the depth of this topic. For the time that we have I want you to understand, that’s something that is on the minds of every racial being. The way in which we respond to the world we live in. Because of what we know or what we don’t know. So, for a talk like this, racial authenticity, you got to remember this power phrase. Now usually it’s a secret I only give the people that are close to me, but I am going to share it with you, so you can take it around and share it with other people. The phrase that’s a secret, that’s no longer a secret to you is, if and only if. The if and only if phrase really puts all of this in proper light. If and only if, and I am going to explain that to you, cuz once you understand that, you'll understand everything else that I am talking about. Think about this, you look at me, you think I am African American. I claim African American. But, how do I claim that? Do I claim that just by what I look like? Or by what I understand? You might not know this because of today's technology, I found out just about a year ago that my grandmother on my father's side, two generations up which makes her I think a great grandmother was American Indian. Her husband, that got all this started, was a Caucasian man from Biloxi Mississippi. So, there you go. In just a few short seconds, and just a couple of key picks on one of those websites that do your generational background, I found out that technically I am biracial. So, the question that you have to ask, when you look at this topic and want to really help those who are dealing with this is, how do I understand this person sitting in front of me, not by what they look like, but by what they understand. And that keeps us on the if, and only if. You have the chance to learn something that people really, really struggle with, but the time we have you'll get it down pat, and no problem. First and foremost, if, and only if. If I understand myself to be African American, and if I live in the consciousness of African Americanism, then maybe the things we write about toward African Americans might be true, if applied to me. If I am a women, and if I am a women who understand what it means to be a women, then things we say about women might be true when applied to me. Again if I was a women. if I am Asian, if I am anything. Things might make sense if that’s the way I live. I have an example to help you understand that very concept. There are few television shows for some of the older people, you remember easily, for some of the younger people, you might have to look them up on videos screen and internet sites. Think about the Fresh Prince of Bellaire, as one example. A wonderful comedy TV show, where the main character was not from Bellaire California but from Philadelphia Pennsylvania. But what was the struggle for that individual? The struggle was how to come out to Bellaire, California, be in brown skin, but yet, be able to still remain true to what it means to be from the intercity and be black. That was the main character's issue. He's from West Philadelphia, he wants to maintain that authenticity that originality of being someone from there. What was the contrast on that particular show. His cousin from Bellaire. Certainly, on the outside looked black, but in his behavior, in his deeds, his words, his phrases, his actions, not just so black as compared to West Philadelphia. That was an issue of racial authenticity. If and only if could you apply what West Philadelphia meant to somebody from Bellaire California, not because of skin color, but because of consciousness. One of my favorites is that TV show where the main character was named Erkle. We all remember, we can look it up if we don’t. But think about Erkle, very smart. Big glasses, suspenders, rainbow suspenders at that, and his pants didn’t quite go down to the top of his shoes. Yes, on the outside he looked as if he were African American. But his actions, behaviors and other issues were seen as not so. But he had a fix for that also, he had an alternate ego, he created another character named Stephan. And that gentleman, that person, was smooth and suave, had all the right lines, and had all the right phrases, to be able to melt in and be accepted. Not only by what he looked like, but what that color actually would represent in larger society. Counselors, like you and I, professionals like you and I, we have the same issue when it comes down to assisting people who are caught in this place. So we tend to read a lot of great works, from a lot of great people about how to help those caught in this middle. But, the secret is, if, and only if. If there conscious daily living is of that understanding, then maybe what we write about them is true. If it is not, it might not be the case, and we have to work a little bit differently. That’s why the issue of micro-aggression comes up for me around this topic. Because a lot of things that our clients will struggle with, when they go through this world, is where they are in life, how they understand themselves, and all the cues in society, that cause them grief. And some of that grief is shared by everybody. But some of that grief, is also shared by what we are a part of if we know it’s there. And sometimes, counselors and professionals like you and I, don’t always understand that. So I am here to help us out based on a premise if, and only if. So that we can help those individuals that struggle with these kinds of issues, and it causes problems in their behavioral understanding, that means by what they are doing, what it does to them and they way they think about themselves, and others, and the way they might feel about themselves. To understand micro-aggression you can understand that in so many ways, and it’s not a difficult place to go. It might be somewhat on the racial front, but let’s start somewhere else that allows us to see it. Think about it in terms of gender, we talk about sexual harassment in the workplace, and sexual harassment in a lot of places. What do we mean? We don’t want certain signs, and certain signals that indicate a problem, in the faces of those who could be effected by it. well, when it comes to gender sometimes that’s easily seen. But when it comes to racial authenticity issues, those of us who live with the understanding of who we are, as racial and ethnic beings, it’s not always as simple. So we look at things like, mammy, we look at things like monkeys, we look at things like all like gorillas, when you talk about people of color, in terms of African Americans. You look at the signs that come out when we talk about our comics and how they make fun of certain drivers who may be of an Asian persuasion. All these kinds of things, whether you want to do it or make it hurt somebody's feelings or not, it’s still what we would call micro-aggression. Just enough that's out there, that certain folk can detect and discern that just messes with you. Just kind of reminds you, that this social, social racial issue, in the world is still there. Whether it’s the old symbols of the clan, whether its secret symbols of secret societies, whether it’s just old cartoons, believe it or not. These things exist, there in place, to make you feel just a little less than. And if you are receiving those signals because you understand who you are, now we know where the work is, now we know what to do. The way we respond to these things, as either people or color, or gender, and that includes my Caucasian brothers too, cuz we can make fun of Irish people, we can certainly make fun of folk who are Jewish, we can do a lot of things to just make people feel bad. When they come into your office, and when they come into my office, we are tasked to help them cope with this. So what are we talking about doing? We are talking about understanding where they are. First and foremost, if, and only if, they are in the knowledge of who they are, as ethnic and racial beings, that requires you and I to be aware of who we are as ethnic and racial beings, so that we can understand their story. Good friends and colleagues of mine in this profession Alan Ivey and Mary Bradford Ivey, were a great, two great individuals in the field, who always talked about being able to be comfortable with discomfort. When you are working with people who have issues. Well, that same phrase is important when you are working with people who are ethnically understood to be ethnic, and racial beings, and when they will tell you their stories about how they see, how they feel and behave toward individuals who give them signals that they might not be very well accepted by who they are as ethnic and racial beings. Number two, if you want to work with this population, and I know you do, because you never know what's coming through the door, you have to realize that in most cases, from the counseling perspective, the psychotherapeutic perspective, that every interaction we have in the classroom, and every interaction that we have in our therapy centers, are diverse in nature. No one person coming through the door is like the person before that one. So we must remember, we must be prepared to realize diversity exists in all shapes and sizes. Number three, if you can detect through various means that the person you are working with is not as clear on who they are as an ethnic person, that’s fine. We have a lot to work with regarding our development, but you have to be willing to go down a road that might have them explore these different parts of themselves. To see if they are responding to these signals around each other, around us, uh, that makes them a little bit uneasy when meeting new people, addressing different parts of society, and of course, addressing the self. And you know, in the counseling profession, addressing diversity was called the fourth force. That force that allows us to recognize the world is changing, it’s becoming more integrated, couples are marrying various kinds of people, and their children are coming forth. They will have issues in their development, and you and I, as we practice and train ourselves to be ready to receive this population, can aid them, but we cannot assume. Which is the third and most critical point. Because, when you look at your client sitting across from you, and working with you, if it is black on the outside, it does not mean they live in that consciousness. If it is Jewish on the demographic sheet, it does not meant that that is how they posture themselves in the first place. So, we cannot assume that they are living themselves strictly within that context. Otherwise the great work of so many people, coming into play will miss. So you must remember the if and only if. Because, without that being in your mind’s eye, we could make the mistake and I know you don’t want to make this mistake. You could make the mistake of assuming an existence on someone that is not really there. Each client has a right to be who they are, and they have a right to discern how they will like their life. But, if they are there, you'll be able to work with them in the best way possible. Allow them to tell their story, you not be on the defense because you understand who you are, and of course, ultimately lead them to adaptive living, with whatever issue they may have. Thank you so much.

SHANNON DERMER PH.D Dr. Ellis, thank you for sharing that. 

00:16:45
DR. CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Your welcome. 

00:16:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D And thank you for sharing your secret, if, and only if. Now not so much of a secret. 

00:16:50
DR. CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS It may not be a secret anymore. 

00:16:50
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:16:50
SHANNON DERMER PH.D Uh, I wanted to ask you um, if every person is an individual, and we may not know their background just by looking at them, or what they mark on the demographic sheet. If everyone is actually a little different then what is racial authenticity? 

00:17:10
Cyrus Marcellus Ellis, Ph.D. 

00:17:10
DR. CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Well, that’s a very good question. And the unique part about this is that question really is not rooted in the professional doing the therapy, its rooted in society around us. We are all products of our society. So, many of us grew up, what Dr. Cornellwest would say in a sense we grew up in a race based society. We have a racial lens. Before we all say, hey that’s a nice looking um, American Indian over there, married to that nice, you know, whatever. We see color. So, its upon the therapist to recognize that hey, the if, and only if applies to all of us, because the individual is and individual until we put labels on them. And if we are not aware that that’s what we have done from the minute of intake, or the minute of the first session, or the first meeting, then we will not let that person be able to say, well I might look whatever I look like to you, I grew up in Denver, we don’t get quote, un quote gang band, in Denver. Or we didn’t have low riders in Denver, we didn’t do certain things that I did in New Jersey when I was a young man growing up in the renaissance of the Black Power movement. We don’t do those things. You know a lot of TV shows make fun of that, if you look back at it, I always think about, I'm a TV nut, as anybody could know, Margaret Showa, a comedian who's Asian. Her first television show was about this very thing. She wanted to be a valley girl. Her parents were traditional Japanese, you can’t do that. 

00:18:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Korean, Yeah. 

00:18:45
DR. CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Korean? Korean. Yes. I think it was Korean. So they struggled on the show and in her personal life it was a struggle to have people see her as quote, unquote valley, or Californian, versus when they look at you I see Korean. So, that’s usually where the struggle is, it’s on those perceiving and trying to help. Have we cleaned out our little basement to these issues, so we can allow a person just to be Erkle. That’s what you are, that’s what it is. And deal with you that way, we tend to want to say, well, that doesn’t sound too black, or that does not sound too this, or that. 

00:19:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Well, that’s, I also enjoy TV and movies, and I really enjoy that you use those for metaphors and analogies, because I think its easier sometimes for clinicians and trainees to start there and then move toward themselves. 

00:19:40
Cyrus Marcellus Ellis, Ph.D. 

00:19:40
DR. CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Well, art imitates life. And uh, shows like Modern Family and all these things today, they could be chapters in our text books years ago. Uh, on how to recognize love versus what you see, and family is family versus what it traditionally has been defined as by society. So, I tend to do that in the classroom. Most of my students tend to enjoy that discussion and it allows me to hit them with the harder concepts after we lay that foundation, through television and art. 

00:20:15
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Good, and you mentioned um, you mentioned some of the TV shows, which is part of my generation too, everybody can sing the theme song to French Prince. 

00:20:20
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I won’t torture you with that. Show off my rap skills. But um, you know, you did, I thought it was great because you did have two adolescent males who are both African American who would probably see themselves, and define themselves, very differently. The Fresh Prince, and I believe his cousin's name was Carlton 

00:20:40
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:40
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS, PH.D Carlton. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Correct. And um, and often there are arguments with each other, where about some of those cultural differences. 

00:20:50
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS, PH.D Which led to authenticity. Many plots of that show, and I always felt that we can write great sitcoms if we used our talents in that direction for this. But, many of the, many of the plots in that show were based on keepin’ it real which is a phrase that kids were using since the 90s. and real to what? Was always the question. Their problems, the emotional, the behavioral the cognitive issues, that tend to develop and many developmental theories, by the way, for people of color is about this, this sense of who am I really? How am I seen, really. Am I being true to who I am? And I remember my years, when I went through it, uh, it’s always been a struggle to say well, what is being black, if you’re going to be cool, you’re going to be down, and the same with Margaret Show, what is the traditional Asian, what is a good Asian, what is a good Jewish person? And there are TV shows, and stereotypes galore about all of that stuff. Uh, not only what you eat but where you pray, who do you love, how do you marry, what do you do, all the morays of that culture. And many kids today don't see it as clear until you point out these plot twists. The dance Carlton is most famous for, not one they say the brother quote unquote, would be doing in the modern clubs. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Right. 

00:22:10
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS, PH.D And, he has a right to dance anyway he wants to. But he can like Tom Jones he doesn’t have to like Earth Wind and Fire. Uh, those kinds of things, go to well, then you not really black, so you wouldn’t go to Moore house. Well, why wouldn’t you go to Moore house? You can go to Moore house, there's not one type of brother at Moore house. There's not one type of Jewish person at yeshiva. There's not one kid of anything. And a lot of times where people are trying to find their connection and they are having trouble doing that. And they get disconnected. What Dr. Cornell West called betwixed in between two cultures. What's typically the struggle, how do I see myself how do I see myself in view of other people? How do I see myself in view of other institutions, like work and would Carlton be asked to join the basketball team if he's at a particular job, but the other brothers, they probably wouldn’t think he's that kind of black person. All those kinds of idiotic things. I call them idiotic only on its face. But the people caught in it, are seriously having a motive issues. The clinician has to be prepared to have those conversations, understand that they could be in that very same pitfall themselves, because you look like the Fresh Prince, but you don’t act like him. We got to be careful of things like that, I believe in diversity work. 

00:23:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Well I am glad you brought up the betwixed in between um, it’s probably one of the most famous things that really brought this up I think, for the African American community in recent history, was Tiger Woods. 

00:23:45
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS, PH.D Yes! 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D What happens when you self identify in one way, how do you help the client who self identifies in one way but the whole rest of the world thinks they should be identified in another way? 

00:24:00
Cyrus Marcellus Ellis, Ph.D. 

00:24:00
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS, PH.D Well, that’s usually the rub. From the outside one tends not, tends to miss the concepts that was really being thrown at Tiger. And it was legitimacy. You know, a lot of black folk who live in the consciousness of blackness, just wanted Tiger to say on Oprah's television show, I am black. Then that would give legitimacy to all the people who said black people could not play gold, cuz that’s a thinking man's game. And football is more physically aggressive, except the quarterback, which we had to deal with that too, but football players were different, basketball players were different. It wasn’t an intelligent man's game, as golf is. Mind over matter is golf, brawn is football, basketball. So all of those folk who live in that consciousness just wanted Tiger to say I am black so that they could say, see we told you we could do it. Where Tiger struggled with, is all that animosity coming at him for people not accepting his consciousness. So we have to help those folk who live in a world where they are being viewed as not as authentic as others, to have them first, we have to first examine how connected they are to who they are. And that’s a difficult place for many to go because believe it or not, those conversations don’t typically happen. You have to live your life and you’re doing what you are doing and if your Tiger Woods, when your, you’re talking about a guy that 19, 20, 21 years old with all this fame. His whole life, he loved his mother, that’s the power of love, who was Asian, in, uh, in terms of her ethnicity, a father who was African American, and they loved that young man, and that’s what his world was. I'm sure being a golfer he heard, and seen some things which is the micro-aggression piece that I talked about, but he had, he was insulated by a loving family. Well now he loves this women who happens to be a blond model, uh, and folk were like ok we'll give you that, and all these other little cues were going on that he had one level of consciousness too, the world had another. And typically when you let your kids out the house, and they go through life, they tend to become, they tend to become in contact with things that don’t necessarily match what they understood. And we have to help kind of bridge that gap. To kind of in a sense educate them to what betwixed in between really means, and then you'll get the socio political racial dimensions that they tend not to be aware of. 

00:26:45
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, that um, we have a few minutes left, I have a couple more questions I want to ask you, but basically, it sounds like our saying for the example of Tiger Woods, that um, he is African American, but he is also Asian, his mother was Asian, he's African American, he is both. Um, but in our culture we tend to think, one drop of blood and you are African American. 

00:27:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS, PH.D Yes, the social justice side of me, uh, helps to advocate for a man like Tiger Woods, whoever it would be that you know, some of what you are getting is really historical in nature, and a lot of people don’t know that history. But the one drop that you just mentioned was an actual, let’s call it a capstone phrase to a supreme court decision about who was African American, or Negro, and who wasn’t. One drop of blood was all you needed by that supreme court decision to be Negro. And so, we was like, okay then we want to claim you if we could. Colin Powell was, Condoleezza Rice, all of you guys. But, you know, you have a right to say no to that, but you know, after so many years, so much confusion, we didn’t, we don’t give them that. So they start to wonder. And of course, in a group of black folk, where this tend to happen uh, we don’t know if we are going to, I've never seen Tiger Woods dance, for example, I guess he could or couldn’t, but if he could not, how would we talk about him? And what would that do to him and his psyche. If he married a black women and she would deny him because of his heritage, what would that do to his psyche, that’s where we would come in. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, great, thank you so much, we are out of time, although I am sure we could talk a lot longer about this. And basically it sounds like your saying racial authenticity is not something that society defines for you, its something that you define for yourself. And as clinicians, we need to be aware of societal definitions, but when it comes down to being in the counseling or therapy room, you've got to talk to your clients about what, how they identify. Uh, I want to thank you, Dr. Ellis for being here with us today, and talking about such an important topic. If you'd like to see some more of Dr. Ellis's therapy talks, or other of our experts on different topics, please check out the website at Alexander Street Press, thank you, all of you for joining us today, and thank you Dr. Ellis.
