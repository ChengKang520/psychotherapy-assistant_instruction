PAT LOVE Hello, I am Dr. Pat Love of Pat Love and Associates, long time relationship consultant, marriage and family therapist, licensed and a clinical member, and a long time approved supervisor in AAMFT. And we're gonna be talking about getting back on track. And getting back on track could be in your relationships, sensuality, sexuality and intimacy. It could be any way in your life that you tend to go out of bounds. How do you get back on track? How do you get back in line with your core values? How do you get back into behavior with which you feel congruent? So getting back on track can apply to a lot of different issues in your personal life. And I might even ask you to think about where do you tend to go out of bounds. If you think about, "Uh-oh, where is that?" I want to say that sexual behavior isn't a problem to most people, just like eating isn't a problem to most people. Or drinking, or shopping, or gambling. There are people who live to eat. They… They eat to live, they don't live to eat. There are people who only eat when they are hungry. Yes, they might eat a little more sugar, whatever, carbohydrates than they… they need to. But truthfully, their eating isn't bound. Drinking is same way. There are people who drink socially. They know their limit. For them, it's easy to have two drink limit, two days off, you know, responsible drinking is not a problem. But everybody in here probably knows a person who has overdone it, gone out of bounds with eating, with drinking, with shopping, with gambling. And sexuality can be the same way. You can cross your own personal limit. So, the key is how do you get back gears(ph)? And here is the question. Those that have lost control, can't quit, lost time and opportunity, and suffered serious consequences. These are some of the general criteria that constitute what's out of bounds. You probably know what's out of bounds for you. And when you're in a relationship, you have to come up with common boundaries, don't you? Common boundaries, but they are… We know that with sexuality, there are some people who have lost control. They can't quit the behavior. They feel like, "It's outside my conscious choice. In a way, I almost feel powerless by it, over it." They have lost time and opportunity at work and with relationships. And the consequences have been serious because of their sexual behavior. So, how do you change a habit? And that's any type of habit. Addictive behaviors, here's a good little starting place, addictive behaviors serve as an antidote to vulnerability in specific situations. I tell the story about, one time I was invited to be one of three conference speakers. And there were only three speakers at this big conference and the other two speakers were John Gottman and Cloe Madanes. And I was so intimidated by being one of three speakers with these two, you know, giants in the field, I prepared in the only way I knew to prepare, and that is I went out and bought the best looking dress I could find. That's the most money I ever spent on a dress in my entire life. I've never spent that much money. There are some of us, when we feel vulnerable, we use our, maybe our proclivity, you know, maybe our addiction, maybe our compulsion to serve as an antidote. You know, that was the way that I, sort of, calmed myself. I went shopping. You've probably heard when the tough gets… When the going gets tough, the tough goes shopping. So, we know that you have… that if you begin to look at, "Well, why do you go out of bounds sexually?" One of the ways you start an intervention is to say, "When are you vulnerable? Whether you're using it to… as an… You know, what's the ant… You're using it as an antidote for what behavior?" So you start to… you got to slow everything down, sort of, start backing it up and look at where you put yourself in a vulnerable position. Addictive behavior is a way to take control against feelings of helplessness. Now I thought there is no way I could prepare enough for that conference, 'cause, you know, I'd spent a lifetime preparing. You know, there is no way I can get as much knowledge about the Gottman work or Cloe Madanes work. You know, there isn't… that I couldn't do it that way. I was… And so I was feeling vulnerable, feeling somewhat helpless, so I did the one thing I could do. I wanted to look my best and that made me feel good. So, you begin to look at where do you feel helpless? Because oftentimes, any addictive or compulsive behavior, you do it to feel better, don't you? You do it to assuage feelings of helplessness, of vulnerability, of shame, of fear, of… of failure. Or maybe even to gain control. "You can't show me. I'm gonna have control. I'll have control over my own body." So, when you are looking at interventions, you want to slow everything down. You want to rewind the clock and start looking at how you put yourself in a position to make that choice. How do you change your habit? Seventy percent of those with unwanted sexual acts report cybersex as the beginning or catalyst to their acting out. And I would just say, put internet in there. Because the internet is accepted, it's affordable, it's… it's… it's accessible and it's anonymous. So, many behaviors in terms of sexuality acting out are facilitated, made easy in an instant with the internet. And that can be a phone, it could be a computer, it could be an iPad, could be a notepad, whatever. But what I'm saying is I was sitting by a man on an airplane one time, and he said… and when we landed, you can turn on your phone, and we had been having a conversation because I was going to a conference about sexual addiction. And he said, "In one click, I can have a prostitute waiting for me curbside. By the time I get… get off this plane, get my luggage, I can have a prostitute waiting for me." It's that fast. So the internet has just made this so accepted, so accessible, so anonymous, and so affordable and so addictive. Because most of us are, sort of, glued to our technology today. Sexual activity can more easily become problematic when it's accepted, accessible, affordable, anonymous. And that's what's happening everywhere. So again, when I talk about this as a specialty in the counseling area, I think it's really important. Because it is a specialty, as you know, addiction is, but also sexuality is and also couples work is. So, if you want… want to carve out a niche, you can carve out a niche in this area. How do we make a change? You know, we know we've identified a lot of different stages of change. Umm… You look at Vachuska's(ph) pre-talk contemplation. You know, this is before you even… are even thinking about it. Like, this isn't a problem. Most people change sexual behavior when they get caught or get… they get negative feedback from somebody they love. I have to tell you, most people go for help around this when they've suffered severe consequences either legal, social, family, friend or relationship, because it sneaks up on you. Because it's anonymous, because it's affordable, because it's so accessible, it's so easy to get to escalate the behavior. Then you have to say, "Okay, well, maybe there is a problem." And that comes way before being determined and then taking action. And I think this last one, next to the last one, "relapse," I think it's really important for us to build that into the change process. Because rarely do you see change go like this. And especially with this issue where there's a slip, or a relapse, or a rep, or a signal that reminds you of the old behavior, it's very easy for the partner as well as the… the person to think this, which is just a little blip or a slip, is this. And you have to be able to say this isn't this. You know, you… yes, this is a behavior, but 'cause you can just imagine the partner, if the partner sees, you know, the other person on the phone and that just reactivates all that pain and vulnerability. And you think, "Uh-oh… you know, he hasn't made a recovery." "She hasn't made a recovery." But truthfully, relapse is a part of maintenance. So, you have to know this is an ongoing process, and be realistic about it. Steps toward change, you know, you got to acknowledge the truth. You got to break through denial. As long as you're denying, lying and justifying, you're caught. Because you're not… It doesn't really, the clock doesn't start running until you authentically admit, "Wait a minute, I'm out of bounds. I'm over the line." "I've crossed the line." "This is not the kind of woman I want to be." "This not the kind of man I want to be." "This doesn't… Isn't congruent with the promises I made to myself and the people I love." Then you've got to list the problematic behaviors. You know, if you think about… if your umm… if your issue is overspending, you know, then you probably don't need to be hanging out in the mall, right. If your… If your issue is… is drinking too much, then going to a bar or going just for happy hour, or going with people that you know drink so much. And then they're going to coerce you or they're gonna try to get you, "Just have just one drink." You've got to know your limits. And then start identifying the triggers, rituals and precursors. The key to making a change is you've got to start mapping this. Because it doesn't happen over here, it happens with my choice, with my decision to answer that call, with my decision to turn on the computer at night after my partner's asleep, with my decision to walk into the casino, because accessibility always increases addiction and compulsivity. When you put more gambling facilities in an area, gambling addiction goes up. So, accessibility is really important. Chat rooms, you know, not to even go there, not to even be tempted. So, you have to list the trigger. But it's not enough to list the trigger, at some point you've got to design a new behavior to do instead. Feel the feeling, but do the right thing. Feel the feeling but make a new plan. So you don't follow the impulse of that trigger ritual or precursor. You got to get… You've got to see… You've got to uncover secrets. And what do I mean by that? You've got to tell your story to some trustworthy person. You know, you don't have to tell every detail to the partner necessarily. By the way, disclosure is a specific training and a specific skill. And this is not something you try without training. But at some point, changing of behavior means I've got to be accountable to myself and other trustworthy individuals. And you list excuses or distorted beliefs. How did you lie to yourself? What did you tell yourself that justified his behavior? What are the distorted beliefs? I'm not gonna get caught. I'm not going to… I'm only going to spend thirty minutes, not three hours. I can handle this. It's not… This isn't the same as it was a year ago. So, you've got to start challenging your own distortions and understand the nature of your behavior. And this is where, again, I can emphasize slowing it down, putting the pencil to the paper, mapping it. How it happens? And then the personal consequences, and then you've got to… break anonymity. Because secrecy fuels the flames. Remember, the getting away with it is part of the thrill. And getting caught in a way can be part of the thrill. So, you've got to shed the light of day on it with a trustworthy person or persons. And there's no substitute for being with people who've been through it themselves. And they'll call you. They will, because they know you can't… you can't… What is it they say? "You can't cheat a cheater." You know, you know if you've, "You can fool the crowd, but you can't fool the players." Ongoing culture of support with informed members. If you want to get better fast, get in a group that have shared that same issue. Design a plan for change and participate in that change process. So… and part of this makes… means you got to make amends to people. You know, if this sounds like the 12 steps, you know, 12 steps have been successful for millions of people. But at some point, you've got to restore that personal integrity by getting back to your core values. And which is you've got to let your feelings guide you back to the kind of man you want to be, the kind of woman you want to be. Now let me just give you a very practical way to do everything. I've, sort of, summarized there. This comes from the work of Pat Carnes, who has written many, many books and designed trainings around the whole idea of sexual addiction and compulsivity. And I love this very simple exercise. And I think you're going to see that it has a lot of different applications. The… Pat just says you… you draw three circles. The inner circle behaviors are the… This is the no fly zone. These are the behaviors that your… that you or your clients are saying, "This is out of bounds for me." This… I have… When I spend money, when I put money, charge something on my credit card, I am out of personal integrity. I now am out of bounds, because I know for me, that's not only… that's the… that's the behavior that led to bankruptcy. That's the behavior that has me $16,000 in debt, when I only make $30,000 a year. That's the behavior. So these are the behaviors, the inner circle behaviors are the compulsive behaviors. These are the behaviors you want to draw a protective boundary around. You know, using… For some people, they have to quit using pornography at all. I mean, or using pornography longer than 15 minutes. Or whatever your boundary is. And this will vary per person. You know, if it's excessive masturbation, it may be that for a period of time, you have to… you have to go without, you know, to be abstinent from it. Or looking at… visiting prostitutes, whatever it is, having affairs, contacting an old lover, texting and sexting or going on, you know, online to find… find lovers, visiting Ashley Madison, which is a website for married people who want to have affairs. I mean, whatever the behaviors are that you say, "This is outside my core values. This is outside of who I want to be." "These are the behaviors… this is a no fly zone. These are inner circle behaviors. And when I'm in this behavior, I know I'm acting out. I know this is the behavior I want to avoid." And so that inner circle behaviors, as you can also have individually, but you might think about a relationship. You might even think about a work relationship, if you're an workaholic, if you overwork, when you go that 12th hour, and you haven't called your mom, and you haven't visited your friends, and you haven't spent time, you know, with your lover or whatever, where is the line? Where's that protective line? Where do you cross the line? And you put the pencil to the paper and you have to identify them. And you have to name them. And what I like about this is, it's all self-assessment. It's not me saying you're out of bounds. It's you telling me. You know, when I start a session, I start it the very same way. How can I help? How can I help? If you left here and you said, "Wow! That time in therapy was worth the time, money and effort." What would be different? And then I always remember PMS, positive, measurable, specific. I want to make it so specific. And so I would spend a lot of time with my client, trying to identify the behaviors that for you, you are saying, "This is when I know I've crossed the line. This is when I know this is unhealthy for me. These are the behaviors. I don't want to go there again." And so that's that… that's that inner circle part. Positive, measurable, specific. Because if you can say, "Well, I don't want to overwork." What does that mean? When I work past six o'clock, I know I'm into my addiction and not into my productivity. You know, when I open the computer after 10 o'clock at night, I know that's the invitation. That's, you know, that… that you… or maybe spending… looking up the sites on pornography, whatever it is. It has to be positive, measurable and specific. The middle circle behaviors, this shows you how it happens. These are the warning signs. This tells you. "Uh-oh, you're… you're walking on thin ice here." You know, you're… if you are already, let's just say. Let's say, you have a budget and it's… it's, you know, the 23rd of the month and you've already spent 90% of your budget. Your… You know you're going in the wrong direction. And by the way, when you're working with people, these are usually pretty easy to identify because this is that no fly zone. But here, these are the behaviors that really indicate whether you're going to change or not. Because you… By the time you… you get to… to here, you know, you're already crossing the line. So, you have to identify these middle circle behaviors. Where do you put yourself in a position? And how do you put yourself in a position to be vulnerable, to feel helpless? Is it when you don't speak up? Is it when you overwork? It's… Is it when you start justifying, is when you start lying to yourself? What is it that are the precursors and, that puts you in an unsafe context? And again, what creates accessibility, or anonymity? You know, it's when I sneak off with the phone or sneak out… you now, when I… when I turn that old phone on that I had as a secret way to be in contact with my affair partners. You know, so you begin to see what is the gateway. This is the gateway to your out of bounds behavior. This is where you start, because here is where you still have a choice. Most of the time by you're here, you're in an altered state of consciousness. You're already in denial. You're already defended, and you're not using your conscious thinking. So out here is where a lot of the… the counseling and therapy works and helps, as we've got to help people understand how they set themselves up for failure. How do you make it hard for you? Okay. So that's that middle circle behavior. The outer circle are… these are the healthy behavior. Not only is this prevention. But here's… here's a really important concept from neuroscience. In order to make a change, it's easier to add positives than eliminate negatives. So, here's the question. It's not enough to stop the compulsive behavior. What are you going to do instead? You know, because a lot of the… this middle circle is what you're telling yourself. "I've worked hard so I deserve this." Or, you know, "All my friends are doing it so why shouldn't I?" You know, "My partner has been ignored me, so I feel justified and do…" I mean I don't know what you tell yourself. But out here are the healthy behaviors you need to use preventatively. And how you're going to spend your time when you're no longer spending the hours in your out-of-bounds behavior. So you've got to design it. So you've got to know what you're going to do instead. That's really extremely, extremely important. So three circle behaviors for the individual, but also, you can use this for the relationship. What is that it goes on between the two of you? How do you make it so that it's not safe? How do you create a lack of safety in your relationship? How do you let yourself get so disconnected? How do you find that you're growing apart and you leave this void in your relationships? What are the behaviors here? Is it arguing? Is it micromanaging? Is it secrecy? Is it staying at work, you know, instead of going home? I mean, what are the behaviors that you want to avoid? It could be the arguing, it could be the blaming, it could be the criticizing, it could be shutting down. You know withdrawing, withholding sex. I don't know what they are. And then what is it that goes on here that sets us up for that? You know, how do we set ourselves up? What are the early warning signs that we're moving out of bounds with each other? But probably what's the most important is this outer circle behavior. You've got to give your brain a better offer. You've got to make a better deal with your brain. And here's… here is what research says that about happy stable couples. They have hundreds of kindnesses per day. You know, yes, they have a ratio. Gottman has showed us, and Richard Stewart showed us years ago, a five to one positives to negatives. But also, they have kindness. They're more agreeable. You know, they're also able to regulate their emotion, their emotions. And the main thing is they share a passion. They have fun together. They're passionate with one another in their activities. So, we may need to make amends in the relationship. Had a couple in my office last week and she really has a hard time because she's being treated for bipolar disorder. And… And she was making such heartfelt amends, I was so touched by her amends. And… And we have a plan. She has a support team. She has a psychiatrist. She has an individual therapist. And she was making such appropriate amends that touched me, it touched her partner. Because then it begins to restore personal integrity. Because then you're walking into core value living. And what do I mean by core values? If you think of someone you admire and what it is that you admire about that person. When you're dead and gone, how do you want people to remember you? And how do you want people you love to experience you? These are your core values. I use those as leverage in every session, because ultimately, you've got to decide what kind of woman you want to be. You've got to decide what kind of man you want to be. And that's the leverage. So, if we look at making change, we know sexual behavior is not a problem to most people. Most people stay well in bounds. And, they could probably push those boundaries a lot and have a lot more fun with it. However, there are those who do lose control. They can't quit, they lose time and opportunity, and suffer serious consequences. And change requires making a plan and working the plan. And ultimately core value living can replace out of bounds behavior. And whether might to… Let me give you one little exercise. Because I know people love techniques. And I do this with couples. So, if I list my core values, and I try to list three of them, I want to be a kind person. I want to be a supportive person. I want to be a loving person. That's what makes me, me. Okay, so I make my list. My partner makes his or her list. And so you're sitting in an office, and you have a couple. You can do this with an individual, but with a couple, I want to show you how to make a connection happen. So, you make your list, you make your list individually. And then I have you trade papers. And you're reading your partner's list. And you're reading your partner's list. And I want you to think of examples of how your partner acts out his core values. And I want you to think. Think take some time to think about it. Because if your partner wrote down, "I'm… I want to be a man of integrity. I want to be an honest man. I want to be a good father. I want to be creative. I want to be dependable." I want you to think of a time when he was dependable and I'm going to get you to tell him that. I'm telling you what, that will move you to tears. We like people who like us. But we love people who see the best in us. If you want to make a change, it's easier to add positives then eliminate negative… negatives. Thank you for that. Thanks. Are there any questions about this? This was a lot of information. I'll like you now to ask me some questions. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN So can you give us an idea of a timeline for couples who are dealing with these stages, and then also, how you help them manage the setbacks that they experience during relapse and that maintenance time? 

00:28:05
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah. Well. If this is a serious compulsion or addiction, research says about five years. Now, we do have individuals who have a more comprehensive collaborative approach. It's that three legged stool where each individual has a separate individual therapist, you know, who understands the nature of compulsivity and addiction. And then you have a third therapist for the couple. And we believe now we've reduced that down to a couple of years. And what a… doesn't mean it takes two years to feel better or to stabilize. That's not what I'm talking about. Most couples, once they… once they get a plan and they start seeing some progress, they feel better. And it's amazing that the… how many… what percentage of couples who seek help, not only stay together, they make a better relationship. They will tell you it was hard going through it. But we're better now. So… So we're looking at shortening that time when you're both returning, because it takes some time to build trust. You've got to log the hours. I think one of your point… your questions was how do you keep from losing heart when you have the inevitable setbacks and relapses? Because it's… it's rarely, if ever, a straight line from A to B. And I think first thing, you can predict it. Know that it's normal. But that's where I really think it helps to have a support group, a sponsor, a therapist who can say this isn't this. This is a slip. This is a warning. It's not back to ground zero. And… And all those good times, all those good years did happen. One of the things you can do, by the way, is keep a journal, you can log, you can take pictures during important times. I often say when things are good, record it. Because then when you need it you can get it out and look at it. Because it's very easy when you have that slip to think, "It never happened. I can't believe you." So you've got to know, that was then. But this is now. And we can make it through. Thank you all, so much.
