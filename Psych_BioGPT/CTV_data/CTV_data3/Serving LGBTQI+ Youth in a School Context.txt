KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Hello my name is Kristopher M. Goodrich and I'm an associate professor of Counselor Education at the University of New Mexico. I'm also the clinical director of a private practice agency in Albuquerque in New Mexico. My clinical work has been oriented around serving the needs of marginalized populations including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender queer questioning, intersects with other persons. Here after referred to as LGBTQI+. My scholarly agenda is focused around serving the needs of LGBTQI+ persons both in the clinical care and through educating counselors and training around LGBTQI+ person's needs.

MELISSA LUKE Greetings. My name is Melissa Luke. I'm a professor at Syracuse University where I coordinate both a doctoral program and counseling and counselor education and the school counseling master's program. Prior to becoming a counselor educator, I worked for many years as both a teacher and counselor in public school settings. I currently have a small private practice working primarily with adolescents and young adults. My scholarly expertise focuses on the effective training and supervision of school counselors in their work with under-served populations namely LGBTQI+ students and their families. Over the past decade, Kris and I have coauthored three books and more than 30 peer reviewed articles, chapters and encyclopedia entries. Our collaboration's actually first started when I was a first year faculty member at Syracuse University and Kris was a doctoral student working at a new LGBT+ drop-in-center. Kris asked me for assistance in identifying the local school counselors, so that he could contact them about the opening of the drop-in-center and important resource for LGBT+ youth and allies. 

00:02:00
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Through the simple project Melissa and I recognized the gap in counselor's ability to effectively respond to the needs of LGBTQI+ youth in schools. In fact, our observations suggested that the vast majority of counselors were largely unaware of who these youth were in their schools. Even though the literature supports that the LGBTQI+ youth population is estimated to be approximately 10% of the counselor's caseload. We responded to our observation by developing a training project for school counseling students were in with our support and guidance, they collaborated with school counselors and staff to develop and implement Gay Straight Alliances or GSAs and acceptance coalitions in five local high schools. Concurrently, we also presented on this work and published conceptual scholarship which over time led to a robust area of our shared research, how to effectively develop counselor's ability to understand and more intentional respond to the experiences of LGBTQI+ students in schools. 

00:02:55
Purpose of Video 

00:03:00
MELISSA LUKE The purpose of this video is to translate what we have learned through our research and that of other committed LGBT+ scholars into highly accessible practice exemplars. Our hope is that viewers like you counselors working with the LGBT+ youth population in schools willâ€¦ A. Increase their self-awareness and reflective practice with respect to their work with LGBT+ youth and B. Expand their knowledge about LGBTQI+ youth, their families, friends and allies, as well as their schools and communities and C. Learn and develop specific strategies, skills and frameworks to support their work with LGBTQI+ youth in schools. To accomplish this, we'll first provide some background about LGBTQI+ youth, next we'll demonstrate a series of interventions each followed by a debriefing that discusses key content and resources that can be utilized by the professional counselors to support their work with LGBTQI+ youth. 

00:04:00
Background Information on LGBTQI+ Youth in School Contexts 

00:04:05
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH When we discussed LGBTQI+ youth, we're discussing various populations of youth that are present in schools. And we discussed populations of students represented by the LGBTQI+ community will include students from diverse affection orientations and gender identities, from the affectional orientation communities students can identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, asexual or questioning their identity. Within these communities, students might identifies as being attracted to members of their same sex, different sex, persons from both sexes or no one. Please note the language we're using, we're using the term affectional orientation whereas others might be more familiar with the terminology of sexual orientation. The term we use is intentional. We believe that the terminology of sexual orientation over-focuses on a behavior which is only one component of an identity. Instead, we see identity such as lesbian woman attracted to other women, gay men attracted to other men, bisexuals persons attracted to persons of either gender. We're questioning identity as being more than just focused around behavior, but reflective with an identity with cultural, intimate behavioral and relational concerns which is far beyond just the focus of the attraction or sexual behavior. This is why we prefer the terminology of affectional orientation, as it helps to destigmatize and demystify affectional identity especially, from those who work with youth or in schools. From gender identity communities, students can identify as Transgender (persons whose gender does not match the sex they were assigned at birth), Gender non-conforming (persons who does not conform to society's rules or about dress or activities), Bigender (dual gender identity), Intersex (variations of sexual characteristics having sexual characteristics attributed to both males or females) and Cisgender, meaning that the gender they were assigned at birth is congruent with how they understand their gender to be. Students from diverse gender identities typically identify outside their sex assigned birth, but makes best gender in different ways. Research has suggested that anywhere from 6-10% of students identify as LGBTQI+ similar to adult population estimates although, some scholars have discussed increased prevalence of this identity in younger generations. 

00:06:25
Needs of LGBTQI+ Youth & Specific Vulnerabilities 

00:06:30
Data 

00:06:30
57.6% students felt unsafe at school because of their affectional identity 

00:06:30
43.3% felt unsafe due to their gender expression 

00:06:30
31.8% missed at least one day at school in past month due to feeling unsafe 

00:06:30
Most avoided school functions (71.5%) and extracurricular acticvities (65.7%) due to feeling unsafe 

00:06:30
MELISSA LUKE LGBTQI+ students have different needs and vulnerabilities as compared to their Cisgender and heterosexual peers. These occur across the domains of academic, personal, social, emotional and career. GLSEN, a national LGBTQI+ educational nonprofit organization has conducted surveys including items falling within the personal social domain and findings have demonstrated that LGBTQI+ Youth can struggle more in school as compared to their peers. As you can see on the slides, almost 60% of LGBTQI+ students report feeling unsafe in school due to their affectional identity. And about half of the same students report feeling unsafe due to their gender identity. The majority of students report experiences of harassment, physical assault or discrimination in school due to their identity. And almost all students report hearing, disparaging comments from their peers in school. These figures not only reflect language heard from students, but between a 1/2 to 2/3rd of LGBTQI+ students also reported hearing this language from school staff members. As such it's no wonder that many students report feeling unsafe to address issues of harassment in school with staff or that once they report such issues that nothing was done to address it. 

00:07:55
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH LGBTQI+ students also report issues of depression anxiety in schools, many expressing fear which influenced their schooling experience. From an academic perspective LGBTQI+ students who reported being harassed were three times more likely to miss time at school during the month of the survey compared to those who reported lower levels of harassment. Those same students faced a larger amount of harassment also had grade point averages about 1/2 letter grade lower compared to their peers and were more likely to report having been disciplined in schools. They also reported greater concerns with self-esteem, lower levels of school belonging and higher rates of depression. These same students also were twice as likely to report that they did not wish to pursue post-secondary education and were half as likely to report that they planned to complete high school which would likely influence students long-term career prospects. Schools that reported anti-bullying policies especially, those that enumerated anti-LGBTQI+ bullying stances, presence of Gay/Straight Alliances or Acceptance Coalitions, curricular resources that paid special attention to the LGBTQI+ community throughout the curriculum and supported educators were far more likely to have well adjusted and emotionally safe students with higher grade point averages and higher reported likelihood to attend post-secondary education. As such, it appears that different systems present within schools do matter to student experiences and there are both active and passive ways to demonstrate a commitment to LGBTQI+ student safety. 

00:09:30
Introduction to counseling demonstration 

00:09:35
MELISSA LUKE The first scenario that we'll see presents an academic focused counseling session between a high school student and a school counselor. It's important to know that research suggests that if LGBTQI+ youth do not perceive their counselors to be knowledgeable about LGBTQI+ concerns or trustworthy with the same, they often do not share their full experience. So while it's essential for counselors to demonstrate their LGBTQI+ competence and to create multiple different opportunities for students to address their full concerns and perhaps even broach the LGBTQI+ identity. It's equally important that counselors understand that not all presenting concerns of. LGBTQI+ youth stem from or relate to their affectional or gender identities. Let's take a look and see how this can be successfully navigated. 

00:10:30
Counseling Demonstration Between Dr. Goodrich (school counselor) and Matthew (student). 

00:10:30
MATTHEW Thank you for meeting with me Dr Goodrich. 

00:10:30
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Sure Matthew, how can I help you today? 

00:10:35
MATTHEW I've, I've, I've been struggling in geometry and I just, I don't really know what to do and it's because it's just gotten harder and harder and I'm really behind and I need help passing and my parents worry that they're going to be really mad at me. 

00:10:55
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Hmm. So it's like a huge struggle for you right now Matthew. What have you done so far to, to try to uhâ€¦ maneuver through the math class? 

00:11:00
MATTHEW Well, I've, I've gone through the notes and I've studied online and but it's just the more I study, the more confusing it gets and in class he's up there talking and seems like he's speaking a different language I, I just, I don't know. 

00:11:20
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Yeah, it sounds like you've tried to do a lot of studying on your own. I'm wondering, have you tried to reach out with any of your peers or maybe sought help from your teacher? 

00:11:30
MATTHEW I couldn't, I don't feel they could do that because I don't really have any good friends in that class. And Mr. Sheppard's uhâ€¦ pretty grumpy and so I, I would just feel too embarrassed. I wouldn't be able to do it. 

00:11:45
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Too embarrassed to ask for help. Ummâ€¦ you've asked me for help. I'm wondering, you know, what's different about asking me for help? 

00:11:50
MATTHEW Oh, you're, you're paid to listen to us and Mr. Sheppard's only paid to teach us math, to teach about shapes. I just uhâ€¦ I don't know ummâ€¦ just seems a lot, less nice, not as nice as you are. 

00:12:10
MELISSA LUKE As you can see in this case, the student Matthew was struggling with an academic issue. He went to see his school counselor Dr. Goodrich to discuss the issue. But he now feels conflicted, sort of stuck about how to proceed. His school counselor attempts to highlight that by seeking examples of times in which he had successfully asked for help without negative attention, maybe even like the conversation the school counselor's office at that moment. The student could understand the school counselor's intervention, but he felt like the example was unique to a particular situation and couldn't be replicated in other contexts in school. 

00:12:45
LGBTQ Responsive Model of School Counseling 

00:12:50
LGBTQ Responsive Model of Supervision 

00:12:50
Focus of Supervision 

00:12:50
FIGURE 1 

00:12:50
School Counselor Supervision Model 

00:12:50
MELISSA LUKE LGBTQ Responsive Model of School Counseling can be implemented to support the school counselor in intervening in this very particular case. The LGBTQ Responsive Model of School Counseling was created so that school counselors can intervene to serve the needs of LGBTQI+ students within a common framework. The American School Counseling Associations National Model using the four domains found in the delivery system of the model, school counselors can employ the knowledge and skills that they already have as school counselors and focus these around the ways to meet the needs of LGBTQI+ students. The four domains found in the delivery system of the Ask a National Model or curriculum, student planning, counseling and system support. Curriculum is defined as any large group lesson or classroom interventions implemented by a school counselor. These could include: wellness or anti bullying lessons or large scale career intervention. Student Planning occurs when school counselors meet with students to establish personal goals and support future plans or collaborate with others for similar purposes. This is similar to advising and consulting. Counseling is defined as any form of individual and group counseling that is implemented to assist students in adjusting to life situations and developing the skills and abilities to effectively respond to their unique life experience. The counseling format can be intermittent and focus on meeting students immediate needs. And it can also be ongoing with regular scheduled meetings for the purposes of exploring and processing experiences now or in the future. Finally, System Support is the administration and management of the school counseling program itself such as the evaluation of larger programming, facilitation of professional development, evaluating the interventions, support and policymaking, as well as connecting students and families to resources in and out of the school environment. The school counselor can use their skills across the delivery system of the Ask a National Model to intervene on behalf or with the students and families with whom they work. Within the current scenario, it might be most useful for the school counselor to focus on the counseling domain while implementing his intervention with Matthew. The student appears to need support to address internal and external barriers for his academic success. 

00:15:30
Systemic Concerns Student Might be Facing 

00:15:30
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH It's not a typical for LGBTQI+ students to feel isolated, alone or ashamed in schools. As noted in the background section of this video, LGBTQI+ students may feel these emotions in a variety of school contacts. It is not unique to LGBTQI+ students, but can feel compounded based on previous incidents of verbal or physical mistreatment, harassment or abuse. It's also important to know that fellow students are not the only source of negative attention. Teachers and other school staff have also been found to say or do harmful things to or in front of LGBTQI+ students. School counselor should screen for these events when working with LGBTQI+ students. So they can know how to best intervene on behalf of the students. This can also help to explain why some students may not feel comfortable in seeking help from certain school staff or peers. It may be important for the school counselor to know what systemic concerns the student might be facing, influencing the barrier students might see in their way. Has a student face harassment discrimination or abuse from their peers or from school staff which might influence or comfort in the classroom or they help seeking behavior? How might access to resources and familial demands influence a student's ability to study or focus on their schooling? Are family members aware the student is LGBTQI+? And could familial relationship influence how the student shows up in the classroom? It'd be important for the school counselor to screen across these areas to better understand the student's needs and the resources they might require. If systems barriers are not present what might be going on with the student that might require support. Is there a mood disorder, anxiety or depression influencing their motivation or ability to concentrate? Or there, are their concerns related to social anxiety which might influence their ability to reach out for support even if there is an internal concern previous concern or actions might be influencing the student's behavior in another classroom? These previous events may be processed either in session with the school counselor or through a longer term community were for all. Like the student have a math disability or educational concern related to their aptitude. These concerns should also be considered for potential issues to address. 

00:17:45
MELISSA LUKE These are all concerns that might be addressed through the counseling domain. Let's go back to see what might happen. 

00:17:55
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH I'm really glad that you feel comfortable with our relationship. I'm wondering uhâ€¦ why you feel comfort with me and not other teachers? 

00:18:05
MATTHEW You used to understand me better and Mr. Sheppard is a lot meaner. 

00:18:10
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Continue, can you tell me more about? 

00:18:10
MATTHEW Well, I heard him joking before class with the other students added. There was like just a stuff like that's so gay, that's queer and once I heard them making fun of how a guy walked down the hall ummâ€¦ pretty sure it's just because he's gay and Mr. Sheppard likes from the joke around like that. I mean he doesn't say a joke, he doesn't actually say the jokes, but he, he likes to laugh with them. 

00:18:40
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH That's awful. I'm sorry that you had to uhâ€¦ experience that Matthew especially, because I know you identify as gay even though you're not necessarily out with your peers. School supposed to be a safe place and you shouldn't have to hear things like that in the classroom. 

00:18:50
MATTHEW It's justâ€¦ I know that they're making jokes about people like me and I can't stand up for it otherwise, I'll be the butt of their jokes or worse because the kids can be really awful sometimes and they always make the jokes before class. So I, that's all I can think about during classroom. Mr. Sheppard is talking about shapes or theorems or whatever I, I just can't focus because I'm thinking about the jokes they're making. 

00:19:20
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Now I understand why massive challenging for you right now. You feel overwhelmed just being in the room. School isn't supposed to be like this. You deserve better for your education. 

00:19:30
MATTHEW Thank you Dr. Goodrich. It is nice of you understood, but what I'm gonna do about math? I still need help passing the class, so I can move on to the next grade. 

00:19:40
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH That's okay. We can form a plan together to address ummâ€¦ how to do better in your math class for you and then I also want to form a plan how to address the school at large. As you can see, I utilize the counseling area focus in the Ask a National Model to intervene with Matthew. The issue wasn't internalized issue, but instead how he had to deal with the school environment. Students facing harassment, discrimination or abuse either actively or passively need support and empathy from a trusted person in their environment. Although Matthew wasn't out, he was facing vicarious harassment based upon the ways in which his classmate discussed other students. Since the teacher overheard the conversation and did nothing to intervene, but instead joined in the fun, the teacher also became not a safe person in Matthew's environment. 

00:20:30
MELISSA LUKE School counselors need to provide support and empathy and when possible resources, so that students can feel safe and empowered in school. In this case, perhaps extra math help could be helpful, as well as exploring if the class environment needs to change for the success of Matthew. However, the school counselor has other opportunities to focus. The school counselor can utilize points of entry in the curriculum to provide anti-bullying interventions and training around how to create safe and respectful school environments. Through the system support focus, the counselor might engage professional development and training for teachers and other staff around the same issues, as well as training about how to address the needs and concerns of LGBTQI+ students. Doing so would help frame how and why teachers and other school staff need to respond to observe mistreatment both in and out of the classroom. Although the original point of intervention with Matthew was around his needs as one individual student, the school counselor has a host of other opportunities to exponentially influence the school in positive ways to ensure a safe climate for all. 

00:21:40
Counseling Demonstration Between Ms. Luke (school counselor) and Davina (student) 

00:21:45
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Next, you'll see a professional school counselor working with Davina, a middle school student who presents with a personal, social advocacy related concern. You'll notice that as Davina and her school counselor explore the presenting issue, potential conflicts arise between the cultural, religious, worldview values of Davina and her family and that of the counselor, as well as the school system and surrounding community as well. We will see how the school counselor works with Davina to support her needs in session and then we'll discuss how she can ethically respond to the potential CRW conflicts moving forward. 

00:22:20
MELISSA LUKE Davina, I understand your frustration. I appreciate you sharing it with me. I, I get it why you want to participate in a Gay Straight Alliance. But like Mr. Parker said we don't have one here of Bakersfield. I don't know what to tell you other than it's not an option. Maybe when, when you get to the high school, something, something that you'll be able to do. 

00:22:45
DAVINA Ms. Luke that's two years from now. Just because we don't have GSA, it doesn't mean we can't start one here Bakersfield. I know we have one over at Jonesville. 

00:22:55
MELISSA LUKE Well, it's true. They, they do have one at Jonesville, but, but Jonesville in the city, here Bakersfield were more rural community and we have 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th graders at Jonesville at 7th through 12th grade and, and I just, I know from, from being part of this community myself. The parents here, families they, they think that the kids are just too young for that lesbian and gay stuff. 

00:23:20
DAVINA My neighbor Ms. Tee, told my mom that when she was getting divorced, you helped her daughter Josie start a Banana Splits support group here and we wanted you to help us support start a GSA like that. How did you get that up in running? 

00:23:35
MELISSA LUKE Hmm. I didn't, I didn't know that you were connected to that family. It, it's true. I, I did, I did help start a Banana Splits group there at the time there were a lot of other families that that were experiencing separation, divorce, deployment and, and it was an opportunity to serve many, many students' needs. And you know, unfortunately, I, I think with a Gay Straight Alliance or GSA, it's a little different. There's just not, not as much of a need in this community. 

00:24:05
DAVINA But I think there is a lot of need and a lot of students would be interested in GSA. And research shows that when there's a GSA in schools, the whole school feels safer and all the students feel more welcomed in the school. And LGBTQI+ students have better grades and they attend more school. 

00:24:30
MELISSA LUKE Wow, you have done your research. There's no question about that. Andâ€¦ and I have to be honest when, when you first came to me about this, I was thinking it was more about, about your dad's and, and their interest in you developing this. And I, I think I'm getting a sense of, of your commitment. You're accurate that research is growing and showing that whether or not students actually even go or attend a GSA or not, they do better in school, they report better uhâ€¦ higher rate of school longing and lots of, lots of positive outcomes. What I can do is I can work with you and your family and I can show you how we developed uhâ€¦ Banana Splits group here, I can walk you through some of those processes and help support you in being able to explore that. I, I just want you to know that personally. I'm, I'm not, I'm not opposed to this ummâ€¦ necessarily, it's just in this community, I think I think you're gonna face a lot of questions and opposition, but, but I am willing to, to help support that. 

00:25:40
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH In this session with Davina, we saw student who wish to start a student group, but face opposition from a school counselor. Although not over, the school counselor attempted to hold Davina back from starting a GSA because of her own biases or feelings about GSAs or what that might mean for the school or students. Some persons might inaccurately complaint with GSAs' with sex talks for places where students gather to have inappropriate relationships with one another. That's not the purpose of GSA's. Instead, GSAs are created to ensure safe spaces for students, to love students from any identity, to build social support connection with others. GSAs might be psychoeducational in nature, teaching students about identity development, communication skills and relationship skills or maybe more social in nature. It's really up to the group and group leaders, but adult own concerts or baggage surrounding sexual identity and how that might or might not really to sexual behavior can sometimes get in the way of facilitating safe spaces for students. 

00:26:40
MELISSA LUKE When considering the needs of LGBTQI+ student communities, this includes not only LGBTQI+ students, but also students who have parents, family members, siblings and friends who identify LGBTQI+. Often these people are referred to as allies, just as LGBTQI+ students are often an invisible minority in P-12 schools, so two can be their allies. Some important considerations for school counselors are that allies have been defined as those working to end oppression and support an advocate for LGBTQI+ persons. Counselor's work to develop allies is a powerful indirect intervention. Allies might go through a similar identity development process as their LGBTQI+ peers. System wide interventions can include behaviors and activities that define "ally work" such as GSA. Development and support.

00:27:45
LGBT Community 

00:27:45
MELISSA LUKE Some communities have developed safe space schools, resource centers and campaigns that have at their mission a focus of meeting the needs of LGBTQI+ youth and their allies as part of GSA work. Although recent national discourse has led to some challenge whether or not schools or communities need to respond to the needs of LGBTQI+ youth, current case law has supported this is a fundamental responsibility of schools. Different regional and national courts have extended protections to LGBTQI+ students based on Title IX, as well as the 1st and 14th amendments of the US Constitution. In regards to Title IX, Henkel versus Gregory, 2001 extended the title nine sexual harassment issues to include concerns related to sexual orientation. Montgomery versus Independent School District No. 709 in 2000 proved that students can sue their school districts for Title IX damages due to sexual orientation harassment in schools. Henkel versus Gregory also extended 1st amendment protection to students, so that they can be out in schools. Doe versus Brockton Schools 2000, similarly extended these 1st amendment rights of free speech to transgender students in schools. Nabonzy versus Podlesny in 1996, extended equal protection clause of the 14th amendment for students experience gender harassment in schools. Similarly, there are other case laws that has been extended to equal protection to students looking to start GSA's when schools were unwelcoming. It was found that if any student group was located on campus, schools could not stop students from organizing other student groups, said another way to stop the creation of a Gay Straight Alliance student group, all student groups would need to be suspended in schools due to this requirement. As such any school receiving federal funding would be required to allow for the formation of a GSA at their school, to ensure that they did not violate these equal protection rights. The Jumpstart resources and guidance provided by national organizations such as GLSEN have a host of GSA resources and organizational attributes. 

00:30:05
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH As already noted, counselors working in a school setting have a responsibility to serve the academic, career and personal social needs of students in schools. Connecting back to the session that we just saw with Davina, if a counselor does not attend to student's comprehensive needs including advocacy for the rights of historically underserved students such as LGBTQI+ students and allies, the counselor may be unconsciously working to further the marginalization and polarization of LGBTQI+ students in schools. 

00:30:40
MELISSA LUKE At the same time, it's been argued that school personnel intervention needs to extend beyond the walls of the school itself and consider the Community Context because schools tend to reflect the attitudes, beliefs and overall climate of the entire community in which they are embedded. Specifically, research has found that while in general, students report that urban areas tend to feel the most unsafe. LGBTQI+ youth report that rural areas feel less safe to them as compared to urban or suburban settings. This suggests that perceptions of safety vary across LGBTQI+ youth as compared to their Cisgender or heterosexual counterparts. Similarly, LGBTQI+ students in under resource communities were more likely to experience victimization than those in more affluent schools and communities. Professional school counselors like me when I was working with Davina, are uniquely positioned to collaborate across stakeholders in the school and community settings and we hold the legal and ethical obligation to do so. 

00:31:50
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH In this instance, we saw the counselor acknowledge potential, cultural, religious, worldview values, conflict across Davina, her family, the counselor, the principal and the school community. Even the potential conflict we recommend that this counselor engage in the Intercultural Model of Ethical Decision-making or IMED for short, as this is the only formal decision making model that assists counselors in counting for not only their and their clients CRWs, but to also examine the CRWs of the practice setting itself as well. Research has supported improved ethical decision making in counselors and training having been taught the IMED and supervised in the application of the IMED to case material. Research has also supported that school counselors and those in training whose decision making more closely and here to the steps within the IMED, resulted in more ethical behaviors. Step 1: Recognize there is an ethical dilemma with the CRW factors imbedded because both the counselor and the client live in a multicultural society and hold multiple cultural identities such as gender, race, culture, sexual orientation and or ability status. Step 2: Identify the CRW factors that are relevant to the particular case. In this case, we would explore the CRW factors for Davina, the school, the school counselor and the community as a whole. We know from the scenario that the town is more rural and conservative in nature. Davina, in contrast, is more liberal and connected to the LGBTQI+ Community. The school counselors are product of her local community and similarly identifies as conservative and religious. Each of these different factors should influence how we view this case. Step 3: Identify and review institutional policies and procedures, relevant case law and professional codes of ethics such as the American Counseling Association and the American School Counselor Association Code of Ethics. In this particular case, we see different multicultural and diversity themes both in regards to the religious and spiritual identity, as well as LGBTQI+ identity which are addressed in this case. We also know the school has a history of forming student groups. 

00:34:10
MELISSA LUKE Step 4: Consult with cultural experts in accordance with appropriate ethical and legal standards to ensure CRW factors have been accurately identified. Within the current case, cultural experts could include community based advocates or allies from the LGBTQI+ community such as LGBTQI+ Resource Center staff, local LGBTQI+ groups or P-flag who might understand the students experience in the school. This could also include the GSA Leader from the area school to which Davino referred. Cultural experts could also include community leaders, as well as school and district staff who may have awareness of the different legal or ethical concerns that could be influencing this case. Step 5: Brainstorm and list alternative courses of action. This could include supporting Davino, to begin the student GSA group, not allowing her to continue her work, finding support for another teacher or stakeholder in the school more willing to help her or sending her to a local community group if available to get her needs met. 

00:35:20
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Step 6: Analyze the relationship between potential courses of action and it's congruent with CRW factors, so those related process actions at the school, community, family and individual level. For example, by supporting Davina's work to begin a GSA, the school counselor could support her and other students in feeling safe in school. There maybe some controversy because it's a conservative school and school counselor may need to explore how it would feel to be connected to an LGBTQI+ supportive group, if this is outside her faith tradition. By blocking the student group, the school counselor might cut off the relationship between herself and Davina, calling to question if Davina would seek her out in future, if she needs help or support. There could also potentially be a legal challenge because the school has other student groups and it may violate the equal access provision of the 14th amendment. The school counselor could send Davina, off to another teacher or school stakeholder to start the group, but again that could add distance to their relationship together and question if Davina would seek help out from her in the future. The other school stakeholder might also need support and how to form maintain a student group. Finally, the school counselor could send Davina to a community group although, her needs may not be met as it would be in school, as it could also send Davina message that she and her friends are not welcome in school or by the school counselor. Step 7: Select, document and evaluate the courses of actions that best meet the needs of clients. 

00:36:55
MELISSA LUKE We suggest that counselors engage in the IMED, to better understand the ethical dilemmas presented and the different CRW factors inherent in the cases that they work with. It is recommended that the school counselor write down each of the seven steps because through our experiences the process of writing down the steps can slow down the process of decision-making, so that the counselor can better reflect on all the factors related to the decision. It is also helpful to see the information necessary and the decision-making steps and to have the ability to refer to this record later. In this case, experts and local and national law may be important, as well as persons with expertise in facilitating GSAs or working with LGBTQI+ community. Because it is often uncommon for school counselors to have clinical supervisors or large numbers of counseling peers around them, it's important to build professional relationships and be aware of supportive resources in their community, as these can help better understand the different CRWs ethical and legal factors necessary to make well informed and culturally appropriate decisions for the best possible courses of action. Next we'll see Preston, a professional school counselor in training as he implements a classroom curricula lesson on identity development with secondary students. As a self identified gay man and social justice advocate himself, Preston is particularly cognizant of the importance of not only the content of what he is teaching, but also the social role modeling he is providing. That said although he is out with this school colleagues including his supervisor who is present today and observing his implementation of the lesson. He has not disclosed his gay identity to his students. 

00:38:45
Identity Development 

00:38:45
PRESTON Well, hello. Ummâ€¦ As you know my name is Preston. 

00:38:50
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Preston, school counseling in turn presents a classroom session to middle school kids on Identity Development. In his first lesson to the group, he reviews cultural identity. 

00:39:00
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ So we're going to be talking about Cultural Identity. Ummâ€¦ How many of you know what Cultural Identity is? Okay, so it seems that most of you know or may be have an idea of what this uhâ€¦ involves and for those of you who do not ummâ€¦ we're gonna review it a little bit today, so you have a better understanding. And so Cultural Identityâ€¦ 

00:39:20
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Preston reviews Cultural Identity with the students by providing a definition and examples of Cultural Identity including the nationality, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation. Preston then focuses his attention on Racial Identity which is one aspect of Cultural Identity. Preston, feels quite at ease talking about Racial Identity, explaining various stages of the Racial Identity Development model. 

00:39:45
PRESTON Next two stages are really a process of developing and kind of engaging with your own racial identity. Ummâ€¦ so it begins to explore, have more positive understanding and even may be counter some of the ummâ€¦ major identity, racial identities or whiteness ummâ€¦ in the country. And so that can involve beginning to ummâ€¦ listen to music that isn't necessarily about and made for by white people or wearing your hair in a style that's one natural. Ummâ€¦ And for a white person, this can also kind of involve the process of beginning to explore what it means to have some white privilege. I know that something that we've talked about ummâ€¦ is that something that you all remember briefly talking about. Excellent, okay. I'm, I'm glad that you remember, you're doing your very great job. 

00:40:30
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH After Preston finishes his presentation on Racial Identity, he transitions into Affectional/Sexual Orientation and becomes noticeably more nervous and tentative. 

00:40:40
PRESTON You know whatâ€¦ 

00:40:40
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH He defines the terms of Affectional Identity through his Power Point slides and discusses similar to the Racial Identity Model, the Model of Sexual Identity Formation and its various stages, but rather than speaking from personal experience and revealing his Affectional Identity to his students, Preston speaks about knowing someone who is gay, when really he's speaking about his own experience. 

00:41:05
PRESTON And so I know ummâ€¦ of a person who kind of went through this and this person. Ummâ€¦ Yeah, this person I guess, 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
PRESTON They came out in high school at 15 and in doing so ummâ€¦ they were the only out person or the only person who everyone really knew that was uhâ€¦ a gay male. And in doing so a lot of the students really found out because it spread through social media ummâ€¦ and through applications and in doing so uhâ€¦ this person really felt isolated. And so this person also used the same resources such as social media and applications on their phone to explore and find different queer persons. Ummâ€¦ So that they could have someone to share and connect with and learn from ummâ€¦ so they do not feel as isolated. Ummâ€¦ and so I know I have interacted with that person, I mean may be you all know someone who's like that ummâ€¦ I don't know if any of you or how you identify but ummâ€¦ yeah. 

00:42:10
MELISSA LUKE As we have just observed the professional school counselor Preston, attempted to facilitate a classroom curricular lesson around identity development. In doing so, he was confident and informed as he addressed racial identity. And yet, he was very tentative in his discussion of affectional identity. Knowing that Preston identifies as an advocate in the community, we must suspect that there's something going on for him that's influencing his delivery of this material. We saw that Preston has responded to the importance of LGBTQI+ topics, issues and historical or prominent figures being discussed in the classroom alongside other identity related topics. By framing LGBTQI+ plus person's lives as normal human experience, one that would be accepted anywhere including within mainstream public education, it helps to normalize the school environment, thereby allowing tolerance and acceptance within the school creating a safer for all student community. When counselors address LGBTQI+ topics using a group approach, it can diffuse potential conflict and increase perceptions of developmental appropriateness. Further, scholars have noted positive impact from the opportunities for LGBTQI+ youth to access validation and support from their heterosexual and Cisgender peers and that is really impact of all. 

00:43:35
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH We have established that public school climate can be challenging for LGBTQI+ students. We believe that this is at least in part due to the lack of training and preparation that school personnel have received. In two studies of school counselor education programs both Luke and Goodrich in Scarborough and Jennings have found very few school counselor education programs have comprehensively address the difference of populations within the LGBTQI+ community. Even when LGBTQI+ students are discussed in training programs, is typically in a one, three hour class using pedagogies used by participants and structures, focused on increasing student knowledge and awareness with little skills base education provided. So many practitioners may not understand who these students are, their identities, what their needs might be or how to provide preventative and developmentally supportive interventions. It is not surprising then that research has found that LGBTQI+ students, perhaps students much like Matthew or Davina, do not perceive a school counselors' as being knowledgeable or sessile to their needs. Increasing the likelihood, they speak to other school staff and not counselors to have their needs met in schools. Following the classroom lesson, we're about to see Preston meeting with his site supervisor who observe the identity development lesson in person. You will note that they not only discuss what transpired in the lesson, meaning Preston's intervention skills, but also how Preston conceptualize the students, the lesson, himself, the school system and the events there are in, as well as Preston's own personalization, reactions, dynamics, preferences, conflicts within him. In the supervision session, it becomes evident that Preston knows more information about some of the students in the class than their families do and that he faces the dilemma and what to do with that information. This dilemma parallels his personal experience of whether or not to disclose his gay identity to his students. It's our belief that school counselors can implement the LGBTQI+ Response Model of School Counseling Supervision to address the situation. With utilizing the intercultural model of ethical decision-making, the only school counseling specific ethical decision-making model to guide their work. Let's see how this scenario plays out. 

00:46:05
MELISSA LUKE I think, it's kind of cool that that we have such strong overlap between the areas of intervention that you and I both deemed were successful in that lesson and then some ideas for future for how you can build on and add and revise things. 

00:46:20
PRESTON I think, you don't think I get a lot of feedback related to that. So I think that was extremely helpful and you're right, I was struggling with whether to like identify that I was gay, on what I am gay. 

00:46:35
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:46:35
PRESTON I mean class and so I think on one side of that I just like personally like, like once it's out there, it's out there and I, I can't control it and what happens for it and socially in the school environment in the community we're in. 

00:46:50
MELISSA LUKE Sure. 

00:46:50
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ And then I guess on the other hand I also could see some benefits to kind of like modeling or indicating that it that I do identify as a queer man. Ummâ€¦ For my students specifically because I had, I know, there are two people who identify on the, on the LGBTQI spectrum in that class. 

00:47:10
MELISSA LUKE In the class that, that I was just anâ€¦ okay. 

00:47:10
PRESTON Yeah, so one of them is actually in my caseload. Ummâ€¦ And so I guess why that was an issue. I think, I guess the bigger issue for me was specifically the student. 

00:47:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:47:20
PRESTON And I would just, I don't know and I was aware of lot of dynamics related to kind of her ummâ€¦ she identifies lesbian, she's not out, her girlfriend was actually in the class as well. 

00:47:35
MELISSA LUKE Oh, my goodness. Okay, so there's a lot going on. 

00:47:35
PRESTON Yeah, yeah, there was a lot yeah 

00:47:35
MELISSA LUKE Yeah. 

00:47:40
PRESTON And so it's actually part of my like intent of using ummâ€¦ kind of Racial Identity and Affectional Identity Development to kind of address and may be normalize some of that for them. 

00:47:50
MELISSA LUKE Okay. So let me just make sure I'm getting this. So, so material that you have been working on with this particular client in individual settings inform some of, not exclusively, but, but it was, was part of some of your background thinking about why that particular lesson and the things that you put it. 

00:48:05
PRESTON Yeah. Okay. 

00:48:05
MELISSA LUKE So there was a lot of forethought there. 

00:48:05
PRESTON Yeah, I tried, I try to be intentional. 

00:48:10
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:48:10
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ But in doing so I guess ummâ€¦ I don't know, I wasn't expecting it, but I would be just became more aware of the fact that this ummâ€¦ to know she's the student there. 

00:48:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. I think you have talked to me about her before. Yeah. 

00:48:25
PRESTON Yeah, her I guess, there's some issues in her relationship. She's disclosed things also like that her partner and her getting a lot of fights that ummâ€¦ it almost sounds like, like internet partner violence. So she's like experiencing some like emotional abuse. 

00:48:35
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

00:48:40
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ And so I just, I'm aware that all those things are coming up and I'mâ€¦ 

00:48:40
MELISSA LUKE Sure. 

00:48:40
PRESTON â€¦ having meeting with her, her parents coming up and like she's not out to them and I'm not out and like there's also this principal. So there's just, it's really, it's a lot of stuff. 

00:48:55
MELISSA LUKE Wow! So there is a lot of stuff and I really appreciate your ability to bring it in here, so that we can look at that and I can tell you've done some reflection even before you've, you've gotten here. Ummâ€¦ Some of it was informing the lesson that you did but you are already identify all these different pieces that are important, that makes me think about LGBT responsive school counseling supervision model that I know that we've talked about. It really frames how, how we approach much of our time here and we have already talked about some of the intervention component that's really where we started today, but, but as you're talking about the conceptualization things. So how you understanding your work ummâ€¦ whether or not how you're going to use information that you have from one setting with Jenelle, right, that was her name? 

00:49:45
PRESTON Hmm. 

00:49:45
MELISSA LUKE Ummâ€¦ in that individual session how that's going to inform your work in a classroom context and how that? Either of those things inform your, yourâ€¦ 

00:49:55
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:49:55
MELISSA LUKE Potential communication with the parent ummâ€¦ that's that's, that's all conceptualization and somewhere mixed up may be in there is that personalization stuff. Really snuck up on you right? 

00:50:05
PRESTON Yeah. It did. 

00:50:10
MELISSA LUKE And, and you know, I, I'm sure this isn't gonna come as a surprise, but ummâ€¦ I'm, I'm kind of joking is it even of as I say it, but like you like to feel in, in-charge and in control. And so, so it's part of why you are so planned for which works in a lot of ways for you. But when that personal stuff pops up like it did in class where you were sure what to do and there was that sort of awkward pause and you know, you look up and you're thinking and the kids are looking around going "Holy, Oh, look what's happened with Mr. Preston?" Ummâ€¦ That's, that's even adds to this level of ability. 

00:50:45
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:50:45
MELISSA LUKE I really want to be able to, to pursue that. That's really that thing that you came in with today like that, that was sort of first on your list. Ummâ€¦ We set it aside ummâ€¦ I want to be clear that I think that, that has a tremendous merit and I think it's connected to, to some of that intervention stuff and the conceptualization stuff because despite my best efforts we can't talk about everything at once. I want to, I want to bracket it and set it aside because it sounds like if I'm accurate that you have this impending parent meeting. 

00:51:25
PRESTON Yes, uhâ€¦ it's next week butâ€¦ 

00:51:25
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

00:51:30
PRESTON It's soon happening. 

00:51:30
MELISSA LUKE So there's something pressure that, that I was accurate that, that. Ummâ€¦ and I, I want to explore more where your attention is related to that and may be if I'm accurate some of, some of the, the concerns that you have about, about confidentiality I, I guess, I'm just going to label it that way and may be there's a potential ethical thing in there, I don't know. Tell me tell me what's going on there. 

00:51:55
PRESTON Yeah, so I have that meeting with the parents next week and I don't know, it's they just I guess, like I guess I said on necessarily how to navigate like moving forward with like I think, I don't know like I, I feel this expectation to kind of like build upon our confidentiality like trust is important to me building that, relationship is really important to me. 

00:52:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:52:20
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ But I'm also aware that like I mean in turn and I'm also aware of the fact that ummâ€¦ like I want to get a job when I graduate. So I feel like I'm, I'm balancing some of that and so like as I'm thinking in terms of what does it mean if the principal finds out or the parents find out that she is in this relationship with this woman or that there is like these things going on. 

00:52:40
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:52:40
PRESTON Or and theâ€¦ 

00:52:40
MELISSA LUKE Or they, they find out that not only she's identifies as a lesbian but she identifies as lesbian and you knew 

00:52:50
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:52:50
MELISSA LUKE And didn't say. That's, is that more of the concern? 

00:52:55
PRESTON Yeah. And why you know her parents also identify is I guess being like religious and conservative and have made it very, veryâ€¦ 

00:53:00
MELISSA LUKE Another layer. 

00:53:00
PRESTON Yeah. I made it very, very clear that they're not like affirmative or supportive of like LGBTQI rights or kind of like persons and I know that the principal at the same time is also very worried about ummâ€¦ kind of like he's also very similar in those identities but is very like want to keep parents very informed and it's about like his identified policies on campus whichâ€¦ 

00:53:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:53:25
PRESTON I guess like would require me to disclose some of the stuff, but then like if I disclose it like there's problems with like my relationship with her and what that means and so it just like I don't know like myself and her like they don't connect. 

00:53:35
MELISSA LUKE Yeah. Well, I, I'm almost kind of envisioning a parallel process that you are out in some places and not in others and that's uncomfortable for you in a number of ways we set it aside, but that's happening and it sounds like some of what you're really struggling with is how to navigate your counseling, your professional values and commitments to Jenelle's a client, but within this larger system and, and it's almost the word loyalty comes to mind, but unsure sort of what takes precedence and it makes me think about the intercultural model of ethical decision-making that I know we have talked about before but, but that model ummâ€¦ really, really takes into consideration, cultural, religious, worldview values of not only the student or the client, not only you as the counselor, but also of that system. And it sounds to me like that's really where the struggle is. 

00:54:35
PRESTON I would agree with that. 

00:54:35
MELISSA LUKE Yeah. So in those instances, it's really helpful to take out that model and look at it through a structure. And so are you, are you willing to, to do a little bit of that with me? 

00:54:45
PRESTON Yeah, I know it's something that we'veâ€¦ you've talked about before with me? 

00:54:50
MELISSA LUKE Yeah. I think. 

00:54:50
PRESTON And I met butâ€¦ 

00:54:50
MELISSA LUKE I think I have it. Ummâ€¦ actually uhâ€¦ right here. So we can, we can sort of take a look and work through and as we've talked about it's a seven step model. The first step is really identifying that, that there is a potential ethical dilemma which you were aware of before even came up. Good job. 

00:55:10
PRESTON I have once. 

00:55:15
MELISSA LUKE You're success before you even started Mr. Preston. 

00:55:15
PRESTON Okay. 

00:55:15
MELISSA LUKE Ummâ€¦ The second, the second aspect of that is to start brainstorming ummâ€¦ some of the cultural religious worldview ummâ€¦ values that, that are taking place. And you said you talked about loyalty, I mentioned loyalty, you talked about honesty and what else is happening for you so well as ummâ€¦ for your client. What do you, what do you think is if played? You talked about religiosity. 

00:55:45
PRESTON Yeah. I know for myself like I value like honesty and openness and communication andâ€¦ 

00:55:50
MELISSA LUKE And you know, just write some of these down because that's, that's really important. 

00:55:50
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:55:50
MELISSA LUKE Ummâ€¦ Aspect as you're talking. I think it might make the easiest for me to write them down, but then I'll give you an opportunity to. 

00:56:00
PRESTON Sort of like honesty. 

00:56:00
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

00:56:00
PRESTON Open communication uhâ€¦ and really building I guess that communication amongst like stakeholders ummâ€¦ my students, myself and the family and so. 

00:56:10
MELISSA LUKE Tell like collaborative things. 

00:56:15
PRESTON Yeah, I learned about that. I think to be very important. So I think those are things I think I identify as being an advocate and allies. So those are important to me. 

00:56:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. Huh-hmm. 

00:56:20
PRESTON Uhâ€¦ 

00:56:25
MELISSA LUKE I knew that about you. 

00:56:25
PRESTON And I guess I don't know, I haven't necessarily thought about the family too much, but it's like what I shared that the family does identify is like being very conservative. 

00:56:35
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:56:35
PRESTON And, and religious and she has the message I don't know if that's like the reality, but her reality is that like it's not okay to take dinner if I as lesbian. 

00:56:45
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

00:56:45
PRESTON And that like her girlfriend comes over and spend the night and then they don't know about that so. 

00:56:50
MELISSA LUKE Hmm. 

00:56:50
PRESTON Uhâ€¦ okay. And I think that kind of also parallels some of how I perceive the schools understanding of things like that. I think they're more concerned about like litigation and policies related to the school environment then may be kind of my students like, like right to confidentiality just stuff like that. 

00:57:05
MELISSA LUKE So I, I hear you having some things that you can identify have kind of group them you can see ummâ€¦ uhâ€¦ about you as the counselor, the person of the counselor. Here's where I heard you talking about her family, your client's family. Here's where you are talking about the school, but what do you think the cultural religious worldview values of your client are? What's operative for her in all of this that we're talking about? 

00:57:35
PRESTON I don't think I've thought too much about that actually. Isn't talked too much I, I know she struggles with like, like her own identity and what that means and it's not out her parents, not really out at school ummâ€¦ and there's like tension related to them. 

00:57:45
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

00:57:50
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ and that like she's been raised. 

00:57:50
MELISSA LUKE Do you see that as connected to safety? I didn't mean to cut you off. 

00:57:55
PRESTON Ummâ€¦I think, it's probably connected to, to safety. Ummâ€¦ she never gets relationships with her parents ummâ€¦ but probably also as you mentioned I could see it being connected to kind of her cultural ummâ€¦ like spiritual beliefs or like familial practices too. 

00:58:10
MELISSA LUKE All right. What do you think helped her be able to be open with you? 

00:58:15
PRESTON I think I have knowledge and I've kind of consulted or talk to you ummâ€¦ or done things like demonstrate that I have knowledge of this community uhâ€¦ but I also think I just kind of go back to kind of my most, my rules and responsibility as a school counselor, ummâ€¦ my rules and responsibilities accounts are at large, I mean just really going back to some of the central tenant and I think it provides a supportive ummâ€¦ and relational kind of aspect to. 

00:58:45
MELISSA LUKE Okay. So those are even some things that we could add here to connected to you but, but we can, we can unpack them and look at what, what's important to Jenelle in, in terms of that. Although the IMED is ummâ€¦ numbered and it's certainly sequential and there's an idea that you move through these, these steps. It's also written about that the steps are not ummâ€¦ kind of lock steps, meaning that you can kind of go back through them and it's quite possible that we are not going to get through all seven steps and have this night nicely, neatly resolved today, and you leave with exactly a plan. Ummâ€¦ Obviously, there's this time you have a week or so ummâ€¦ ummâ€¦ and, and perhaps, there's an opportunity for us to begin to frame out some next steps, but that you'll do some added work outside of, here we can come back and, and, and take a look at this as we go. I know I've said before that it is really important to write these down part of writing it down is just to help us be able to think and see and hold lots of disparate information. So, so it's a just about a cognitive sort of aspect, but there's also an emotional aspect in that lots of people. I don't know about you. You'll have to let me know. But this can be anxiety raising, right. Trying to, we want to do the right thing for our clients. We ummâ€¦ and, and we want to be able to have some clarity. Sometimes working through this model, it gets, it gets grey before it gets clearer, so to speak. 

01:00:20
PRESTON Yeah. 

01:00:20
MELISSA LUKE Talk about black and white, right. Like it, it gets really muddy and ummâ€¦ and having it written down can be helpful in binding some of that. And it can also be helpful to have this, this record because ultimately you want to be able to document what, what, what you're doing. I'm gonna set this, all of that set, I'm gonna set it aside and I wanna, I wanna kind of go in the mud for a, for a couple minutes here. Ummâ€¦ I hear you talking about confidentiality of disclosing or not disclosing. One of the steps in the model is to lay out as many possible courses of action as can be, not, not the most desirable one, not the ummâ€¦ you know most likely one, but what are the possibilities. So what do you see here that, that are choices for you? 

01:01:10
PRESTON Yeah. Well, and I guess I think of like I first would want to go to things of like rules and laws related to like where I'm located or so in New Mexico, you know, the age of kind of consent ummâ€¦ to counseling as 14. 

01:01:25
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:01:25
PRESTON Because I know Jennelle 16th, so I think that's an aspect of it I think. Ummâ€¦ They're both the same age and the same grade. 

01:01:30
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:01:35
PRESTON And so I'm not necessarily make theâ€¦ 

01:01:35
MELISSA LUKE So the age of sexual consent sexual activity. 

01:01:35
PRESTON Yeah. So I think those are may be a piece of that. Ummâ€¦ And so I guess, I don't know that's a part of it, but then I, if I think about my kind of my actions, if I feel safe in those then I think it could putâ€¦ 

01:01:50
MELISSA LUKE You know, I just want to clarify, you feel safe in those meaning that you don't have to break confidentiality because of those? 

01:01:55
PRESTON Yeah. 

01:01:55
MELISSA LUKE Okay. I just wanted to make sure. 

01:02:00
PRESTON I mean I, yeah, I don't think I have to break confidentiality. I think it would have like I could go in the like we could have ethics and document that I'm doing what I need to do at the GLSEN school practicing 

01:02:10
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:02:10
PRESTON School counselor. Ummâ€¦ But then if I think of actions I think then it gets muddy as you said like I could just leave it out there and let her move forward andâ€¦ 

01:02:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:02:20
PRESTON â€¦ kind of do whatever she wants. 

01:02:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:02:25
PRESTON But then kind of going back to that if the parents want to find out and school counselor find out, if you come back to meâ€¦ 

01:02:25
MELISSA LUKE Find out what? 

01:02:30
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ That she's in a lesbian relationship or find out that she identifies as lesbian at this time ummâ€¦ that I knew that I didn't do anything, that I didn't alert the principal alert administration. 

01:02:40
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:02:45
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ Like just sort of there's all that likeâ€¦ 

01:02:45
MELISSA LUKE So it sounds like, like part of your concern is and you may be really accurate about this, but your concern is about how her parents may react to her identity, how the principal may react to her identity. So, so you're, you're anticipating their response based on their cultural, religious worldview. When I hear you talking earlier about, about your concerns for her, your concerns for her, it, it seemed like it was more related to the potential of safety or lack of safety in this relationship that you're not so sure about. 

01:03:25
PRESTON Yeah. If I disclose, if I tell the parents like your daughter's lesbian, she's in this relationship and it's a potentially impacting her grades or all these things thenâ€¦ 

01:03:35
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:03:35
PRESTON I would like she, like she doesn't have a safety now like she doesn't have anyone likeâ€¦ 

01:03:40
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:03:40
PRESTON So I, I would worry about what that would mean for kind of or kind of relationship. 

01:03:45
MELISSA LUKE Your therapy? 

01:03:50
PRESTON Yeah, and also like if she were to need be in the future, would she come back to me? 

01:03:55
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:03:55
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ And I also worry about if I like encourage her and build her up and like a sister and feeling that she could potentially even disclose this to her parents. 

01:04:00
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:04:00
PRESTON Like how are they going to treat her? Will she, like will they understand? Will she, like be kicked out of her house? I think, I think like I just there's like no clean answer 

01:04:10
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:04:10
PRESTON And so I don't like it. 

01:04:15
MELISSA LUKE And all of these are focused on, on her coming out or being outed. 

01:04:15
PRESTON Yeah, and her safety. 

01:04:20
MELISSA LUKE Well, yeah and, and I wanna like fiddle about that information sort of like, I don't know what this would be but, but is there a way that part of, not part of, your disclosure could focus on Jenelle potentially from your perspective being in a relationship with a student in her class, a peer, a friend, however that person gets labeled ummâ€¦ that, that isn't, isn't good for her that might not be healthy. Is that, does that have the same weighted threat to her safety? 

01:04:55
PRESTON Probably not. 

01:05:00
MELISSA LUKE So what, what are your thoughts as I, what, what hits you as you think about them? 

01:05:05
PRESTON Well, I guess like when I think about like safety, I think of uhâ€¦ I don't think about it, but may be safety in terms of may be even her own relationship with this girl. 

01:05:20
MELISSA LUKE Hmm. 

01:05:25
PRESTON Uhâ€¦ And that if there is emotional abuse occurring and, and what that means, I think that might actually be more like of an immediate concern. 

01:05:35
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:05:35
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ I mean I do think those other things are also very important in kind of have safety, but may be safety is not the right word for that. 

01:05:40
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:05:45
MELISSA LUKE So, so you weighed out a couple possible ummâ€¦ courses of action and we want to document that ummâ€¦ on paper too, but may be an additional course of action is ummâ€¦ about, about focusing on the qualities of the relationship or your observations or her report about what might, might be getting in the way for her, what you might be judging as this as a challenge. In this IMED, ummâ€¦ and, and it's true actually of every ethical decision-making model that that I've at least come across, the need for consultation is important. And so I think, I think the next step for us, for you is to think about ummâ€¦ what types of cultural experts might be helpful to gain some information to broaden your perspective, to add actually if it's not complex enough already. Ummâ€¦ add some complexity to what we're looking at and then we can come back here with additional information. But what, what places might you look for some cultural expert? 

01:06:50
PRESTON You might be want. 

01:06:55
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

01:06:55
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ I think so ummâ€¦ and I mentioned and like kind of lesson today that the GSA. So maybeâ€¦ 

01:07:05
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:07:05
PRESTON The GSA might have some potential just resources ummâ€¦ I think also ummâ€¦ there are some I think LGBT supportive churches nearby. 

01:07:15
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:07:15
PRESTON So maybe that's something you could do is kind of reach out to. 

01:07:15
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:07:20
PRESTON Ummâ€¦ Someone with the kind of that has both a similar kind of religious perspective. 

01:07:20
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:07:25
PRESTON And also identifies as I guess within the LGBTQI Spectrum. 

01:07:25
MELISSA LUKE Sure. There's, there's a number. I mean dignity, GSA is, is one. Ummâ€¦ There's, there's a number of others but sure. 

01:07:35
PRESTON And maybe look at things online I could probably. 

01:07:35
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. 

01:07:35
PRESTON May be with her something like that. 

01:07:40
MELISSA LUKE Huh-hmm. Huh-hmm. And you know, it makes me think about ummâ€¦ really the beginning of your, of your lesson today ummâ€¦ where you were really trying to demonstrate to students that there's an intersection of, of identity components. And so ummâ€¦ I, I don't know ummâ€¦ the other student involved, but to think about ummâ€¦ not just a sexual identity, but racial identity, socio economic aspects. Ummâ€¦ we've talked about religiosity, but, but thinking about hose things too and looking at experts across, across there as well. 

01:08:10
PRESTON Yeah. I think of all. Well, I think a different thing that would be helpful for us because and her partner ummâ€¦ There's a different like race than soâ€¦ 

01:08:20
MELISSA LUKE I, I sort of had some kind of sense of that one. 

01:08:25
PRESTON Yeah. 

01:08:25
MELISSA LUKE Once you started saying that, that some of the intentionality I wasn't sure about you. So, so are you comfortable with, with the kind of the plan that you will document some of the things that we've talked about that you as a next step outside of here will ummâ€¦ make some contact with some cultural experts you work through a little bit here and then maybe we can, we can schedule time for ummâ€¦ I don't, I don't know, I think that's Monday. I might have a couple uhâ€¦ openings if, if that works so that I give you enough time beforeâ€¦ 

01:09:00
PRESTON Yeah. Meet within them next Wednesday. 

01:09:00
MELISSA LUKE Wednesday? 

01:09:00
PRESTON So that would beâ€¦ 

01:09:00
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

01:09:00
PRESTON â€¦ great if I could come. 

01:09:00
MELISSA LUKE Okay. 

01:09:00
PRESTON So do feel a little bit like you do you think it would be helpful to kind of sitting right out, so I think like I'm still feeling it a little bit. 

01:09:05
MELISSA LUKE Sure. 

01:09:10
PRESTON So I definitely think it would be beneficial to read about, and, and to document it and just have a little time to, maybe consult again before. I meanâ€¦ 

01:09:15
MELISSA LUKE Absolutely. 

01:09:15
PRESTON â€¦ with the parents. 

01:09:15
MELISSA LUKE Right. 

01:09:15
MELISSA LUKE Right. Because I, I do in our work together know that you're ummâ€¦ kind of an internal processor as compared to my external processing, but that, that like, like it might take some time for you to sort out. Uhâ€¦ and, and that might be a good idea to have to take ummâ€¦ the plan that you develop, ummâ€¦ and, and for us to do some ummâ€¦ brainstorming about how you, how are you going to approach her and her parents as well? You have about 15 minutes left in our, our session here today. And I don't know that it's enough time to completely ummâ€¦ really explore all of your stuff related to that aspect of what you, what you wanted to bring in but, but I'd like to at least offer you the opportunity to use the time that's left to explore that, that tension and that discrepancy. You really had a dilemma. Do I, do I kind of live my truth about who I am and use, use this as an opportunity to be uhâ€¦ a model ummâ€¦ or, or is it, is it important for me to pay attention to this social context that I'm in and the feelings of vulnerability and protect myself as well? 

01:10:30
PRESTON Yeah, I think that would be very, very helpful. 

01:10:30
MELISSA LUKE Great. 

01:10:35
PRESTON Thank you. 

01:10:35
MELISSA LUKE You're welcome.

KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Clinical supervision is the signature Pedagogy of the counseling profession. Supervision is an intervention by a more senior member of the profession to the more junior member of the profession. It is evaluative of hierarchical relationship typically ongoing and extending over time with the simultaneous purpose of enhancing professional functioning, monitoring quality of professional services provided to clients, as well serving as a gatekeeper for the profession. Given that supervision in school settings is underutilized and LGBTQI+ Plus students' needs are so often overlooked. The LGBTQ Responsive School Counseling Supervision Model can serve as a framework for counselors in schools to address LGBTQI+ persons across the service delivery model including individual and group counseling, classroom curricula, consultation and advisement and system support. In this instance, the point of entry is Preston's classroom curricula lesson. Next the supervisor needs to decide which of the three areas of focus to start namely: On the intervention skills, what Preston is doing or not doing. The conceptualization skills: How Preston is thinking about and understanding the related material or Personalization: The ways in which Preston's own stuff like values and reactions might intersect. In this case, the supervisor acknowledges Preston's personalization with respect to self-disclosing his identity, but elects to focus on conceptualization relate to the potential ethical dilemma. Within the supervisory model, the supervisor has one of three wall postures to take: as teacher, counselor or consultant. Given Preston to ask for help, the supervisor initially takes the teacher role and then proceeds accordingly and draws from the others later. While moving across, the supervisory roles can be helpful. Supervisors are cautioned not to slide across the different areas of focus because it can be confusing to the supervisee. 

01:12:50
MELISSA LUKE As Kris just said Preston presented in supervision with a number of possible points of entry for the supervisory focus. It was helpful to acknowledge the possibilities and the rationale to prioritize the possible ethical dilemma itself. Not only was the parent meeting impending, but there were potential concerns about the student safety as well, as well as institutional requirements at his school site working with LGBTQ+ students. Institutional policies and state laws vary from place to place, so school counselors need to be well informed and utilize supportive resources to know the legal requirements of their specific district and school policy. You heard me as the supervisor stressed to Preston to write down the responses to each of the seven steps in the IMED. That's recommended for reasons already discussed, but also because it might take longer than a single session to work through the entire model. We have found that writing down the steps helps suspend the potential and or conflict that can be felt in the decision-making process not having an immediate answer. And by writing it down it permits us to see the situation more broadly, because it can be uncommon for school counselors to have clinical supervisors or large numbers of professional counseling peers around them. It's important to build professional relationships and be aware of the support of resources in the community as these are important to help better understand different CRWs, as well as the ethical and legal factors necessary to make well informed and culturally appropriate decisions. Once the ethical issue is addressed as Preston supervisor, I would want to return to Preston's apparent internal struggle about disclosing his own identity. Not only did Preston identify this in his own ambivalence at the start of the session, but this quandary resonated with what Bernard and Goodyear articulated related to the most and least ingrained aspects of a person's identity. They noted that the most in grained aspects of a person's identity or gender and ethnic identity, the middle or mid amount of ingrained identity relates to our familial identities and least ingrained is a professional identity. Although Bernard and Goodyear representation of ingrained identities was representative and it's not intended to be inclusive of all potential intersecting identities, it serves as a good basis for us to consider how internalized or externalized affectional and gender identities may be with a particular supervisee. In this case, we see Preston struggle about how his affectional identity intersects with his professional identity, but there's a parallel there for his students as well. 

01:15:40
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Anecdotal and empirical research has demonstrated that schools can be hard contacts for LGBTQI+ students to navigate whether be to explore their identities, make friendships form new relationships, as well as focus on their academic and later career development. As such it's important for school professionals to ensure that they can still stay in rich school environments, to be supportive and nurturing for all students. To accomplish this, school counselors need to be continuously reflective with their practice, within the school environment. Use of establish frameworks and models of school counseling are fundamental to ensuring a supportive experience as attempts to provide social justice can serve to be both supportive and challenging to students depend on the social justice model as it is (inaudible )immomented. Therefore, we've attempted to provide empirically research models of ethical decision-making, counseling practice and supervision created with the needs of LGBTQI+ students in mind to support school counselors within their school environment. This work requires a process of continued reflection, evaluation and revision to ensure that we can best respond to the diverse needs of all of our students and stakeholders within the school environment. This includes: Ongoing engagement with professional development, personal reflection, external consultation and supervision, as well as solicitation of multiple forms of feedback. As we continue to strive to support LGBTQI+ students academic, career and personal social success is important to explore how we can better engage with students across the delivery system domains of individual and group counseling, student planning, curriculum and system support to ensure that we provide a comprehensive and developmental school counseling program to meet the needs of our students. 

01:17:30
MELISSA LUKE We recognize that identifying, honoring, affirming and responding to the diverse needs of all of our students and school stakeholders including those who are LGBTQI+, it is an ongoing, iterative process. We know from research and experience that a single intervention will not serve all students, as students' needs are as diverse as the entire continuum. Therefore, coupling extended models of LGBTQI+ interventions along with creativity and knowledge of our individual students and groups, as well as plan spontaneity or what I like to say is pre-planned interventions that we can pull from as a tool box or tool belt when called upon, those are useful to serve students needs. Ongoing assessment and program evaluation are necessary to ensure that our interventions whether they be classroom curricula, professional development or individual or group intervention are necessary to ensure that we're meeting the needs of the students. As we continue to strive to support LGBTQI+ students' academic, career and personal or social success, we can further explore the role of group work and systems wide programming in schools. 

01:18:55
KRISTOPHER M. GOODRICH Counseling LGBTQI+ students' gets to the heart of what school counseling is, serving the needs of marginalize youths and making more possible opportunities for a future life that youth might not even dare to dream. 

01:19:05
MELISSA LUKE You are important for the future of these students. And we thank you for your investment and passion to ensure that you can best serve students' needs.
