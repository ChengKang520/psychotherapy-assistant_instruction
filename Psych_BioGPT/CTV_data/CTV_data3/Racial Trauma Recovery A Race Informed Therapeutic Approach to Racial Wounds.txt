MARIE L. MIVILLE Good afternoon. Welcome to the Janet E. Helms mentoring award address and I'm so pleased and honored to introduce to you one of the most renowned psychologist working in our field today, Dr. Lillian Comas-Diaz. Lillian's academic and professional volunteering work centers on multiculturalism, feminism, mental health, social justice and spirituality. She's done so many things in her long and illustrious career including developing a Latino community, mental health program in Connecticut in the 1970s. Being a faculty member at the Yale University Psychiatry department and the director of the Yale University Hispanic Clinic directing the American Psychological office of the ethnic minority affairs and co-founding the Transcultural Mental Health Institute. Lillian was the founding editor-in-chief of a very well-known journal, ah, for division thir-- ah, 45, the cultural diversity in ethnic minority psychology journal and she currently serves as an associate editor for the American psychologist. Lillian today is in private practice, is a psychologist and also a clinical professor at the George Washington University Department of Psychiatry of Behavioral Sciences. With over a hundred and 50 publications, that's a lot but she's still going strong. She's also the author of several books including multicultural care, the clinician's guide to cultural competence. Psychological health of women of color into sections, challenges and opportunities with Bev Green whose here today and she's also another Janet Helms award winner. So definitely buy that book. Ah, Women's Psychotherapist, Journeys in Healing and Women's Psychotherapist Reflections on Female Friendships, ah, both of them with, ah, Weiner. So I also like to tell a, you know, a little personal story when I do these introductions. And so on a personal note I can say that I've known Lillian through her wor-- he writings actually almost my entire professional career beginning with the very first cross cultural counseling class I ever took taught none other by Janet Helms, the person for whom the award is named. And as a matter of fact, for my entire training program I actually was never able to work with a Latina mentor directly like Lillian. And so only learned from her and other patinas sort of from afar until of course I moved far into the field. Uhm, in fact, I actually remember coming up to Lillian, at a conference many years ago, a young wide-eyed graduate student. Yes, I remember those days. To tell her how much I admired and learned from her work. And as her usual humble style, she just very kindly listened and thank me. So, fast forward 20 years and today now I'm the president of the National Latinos Psychology Association and so I was about to send out my very first message to the entire membership as a welcome to 2015. So whose words and wisdom did I refer to? Lillian's. And here's what I cited, ah, for my message to the membership of NLTA and it goes-- I think it so beautifully captures just what is so inspiring and healing about Lillian's work and why she was selected as the 25th awardee of the Janet Helms mentoring award. She writes, accepting my ancestors' traditions helped me to view psychotherapy both as a profession and as a calling. Thus I embraced multiple ways of knowing including scientific as well as intuitive approaches. History and politics taught me psychotherapy's power to address oppression. Consequently I envisioned the psychotherapist role both inside as well as outside the consulting room. E.T. Halls' exhortation that we cannot be free until we allow others to be themselves further inspired me. As a result, I used the same word to spell healing and liberation. And so we are honored to present Dr. Lillian Comas-Diaz with the Janet E. Helms award and we'll welcome her from her address, thank you.

Racial Trauma Recovery: A Race Informed Therapeutic Approach to Racial Wounds Lillian Comas-Diaz, Ph.D. Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences The George Washington University School of Medicine Washington, DC "Each person speaks with his/her father's (mother's) tongue; ask a person who (s)he is and (s)he names a race. Leonard Cohen, The favorite game Purpose of Presentation Share a race-informed Approach to Racial Wounds .... from a clinical-social justice perspective Why Therapy? His resistance to therapy could be due to death 

00:05:15
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Thank you so much. Uhm, I'm afraid I'm gonna be speechless now after diving to the ocean. Uhm, I am honored to be receiving this award because mentoring for me has always been the language of the heart. By awarding me this award, you are really acknowledging all of my mentors, my peer mentors and many of them are here today. And my mentees who I know that they would continue. They do carry the sacred beauty of mentoring others. Let's talk about what? I'm supposed to be talking about today which is race. Each person speaks with her father's (mother's) tongue, ask a person who he is and he names a race. What I would like you to do today is to share a race-informed approach to racial wo-- wounds from a clinical perspective but also for the social justice orientation. For the-- and integrated approach. Why therapy? What can therapy do with racial wounds? We know that there's a lot of resistance to therapy. Okay, you can laugh. We also know that some people going to therapy and they come out as this, uhm, patient of the psychoanalyst by Remedios Varo's, uhm, carrying the heads of their previous therapist. However, I remain a true believer of the power of therapy and I'm delighted that you mentioned that connection between healing and liberation.

"I change myself, I change the world." Gloria Anzaldúa "It takes a thousand voices to tell a single story." Native American saying Race-informed Trauma Approach 1. Clinical practice with People of Color 2. Trauma Therapies 3. Cultural Context 4. Intersectionality of Diversity variables 

00:07:40
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS I change myself, I change the world. Gloria Anzaldúa really was (inaudible ) whatever she is right now, genius. So the story that I'm gonna tell you is the story that has been told a thousand and more thousand times. What I would like to do today in this integrated approach is based on my clinical practice of over three years with people of color infused with mainstream trauma therapies embedded in a cultural context and acknowledging the intersectionality of diversity of variables and this work is, uhm, going to be part of a book, ah, published by a P.A., uhm, contextualizing the cost of racism for people of color. Let's talk about the intersectionality of diversity variables specifically with trauma. 

00:08:55
Gender and Trauma • Women have twice the risk of developing PTSD • Women suffer longer from symptoms • Women develop more sensitivity to trauma related stimuli Models of Trauma Recovery • CBT for trauma • EDMR • Somatic Experiencing • Brain spotting • Cohen, et al. 2008 • Francine Shapiro • Peter Levine (1997) • David Grand What about racial wounds? "A thousand year of history are more than good intentions." Jeanne Kilpatrick 

00:09:00
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS We know as psychologists that women have twice the risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder. We also know that women suffer longer from these symptoms. We also understand that women develop more sensitivity to trauma related stimuli. Therefore, looking at the dominant trauma therapy models, its imperative. CBT have developed a orientation specifically for trauma, EMDR, ah, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing by Francine Shapiro, we are familiar with that. That's been tested and some, ah, research on that. Somatic experiencing, Peter Levine's, uhm, position based on his research that we actually need to learn from the animals. They are confronted with trauma and they, they, they-- there's, ah, these regulation and they regulate themselves. So maybe we need to be more animals, huh? In brain spotting which some of you may know is actually, uhm, a part of EMDR but it specializes more in how the trauma gets embedded not only in the body but in the brain and using eye movements, uhm, focusing where the brain has the trauma can really release a lot of the traumatic effect and the true, ah, healing. David Grand has been the, ah, proposant of that. So those are the, uhm, mainstream trauma therapy and some of them work very well. I know, uhm, Rittenhouse the, ah, adaptation of EMDR was actually a Latina client with very good successes but what about racial wounds and how do trauma therapist can address, uhm, racial problems and racial wounds particularly when a thousand years of history are more than good intentions.

00:11:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS This is a painting by Arnaldo Roche Rabell, a Puerto Rican, uhm, artist who basically in his work, he emphasizes the, the African American Perspective because he feels that race is so important and that, that the first thing that people see and the difference in that we need to address. 

00:11:45
Models of Racial Trauma Recovery • Oppression-informed • Race-informed • Ethnopolitical approach • Dunbar, 2001 • Bryant-Davis & Ocampo, 2006 • Comas-Diaz, 2007, in press Oppression-informed Trauma Model (Dunbar, 2001) 1. DEVELOPMENT OF SAFETY 2. ASSESSMENT OF CLIENT & INCIDENT CHARACTERISTICS 3. ADDRESSING DIVERSITY ISSUES IN THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE 4. ACUTE SYMPTOMS REDUCTION 5. IDENTITY REFORMULATION 

00:11:50
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS So let's talk about some models of racial trauma recovery. Ed Dunbar which many of you are familiar with because I think he was one of the people who coordinated this round, ah, table-- winter round table many eons ago. I'm not gonna tell you how long it go because, that. Uhm, developed a, uhm-- cuz I was there too, developed a, ah, very interesting oppression in form, a model and he targeted the victims of hostility whether it was, uhm, racial hostility, gender hostility, religious hostility. Uhm, and we'll talk about that in a moment. The race informed, uhm, clinical approach that Thema Bryant-Davis & Ocampo developed is actually very well versed in the clinical medium by addressing and I'll, I'll talk a little bit more about it in a moment, addressing specifically Richard Wendt(ph) what I call-- and there's not political approach which in 2007 I basically addressed the sociopolitical aspect of it and now I'm working more on that integration of the clinical and the, uhm, ethnopolitical perspective of trauma. So this is Ed's, uhm, model. Of course, when you work with trauma victims, the first thing you have to do is, uhm, establish a safety environment or work with the client, the survivor to feel safe and that's possible when the trauma has passed. But I started all, uhm, my major interest in trauma when I went to Chile with, uhm, ah, as part of a delegation from the two APAs to study what the psychologist had been, uhm, using their training for-- they have a reason. For, uhm, helping Pinoche(ph) to do his job. So interesting isn't it? And, uhm, one of the sense I learn is that the dominant train, ah, trauma therapies really don't work when the trauma is happening on an ongoing basis. So okay, now we're talking about political repression but what about racism? That's an interesting question isn't it? The second stage in, ah, Ed's, ah, Dunbar's model is, uhm, of course assessing the clients and the incident characteristics. What specifically, what happened to be able to target and, ah, personalize the treatment to, uhm, to the survival. The first stage is addressing diversity issues in the therapeutic alliance, hello of course. Ah, cultural differences and cultural issues between therapist and clients do matter so we have to do that particularly in trauma therapy. The fourth stage is, uhm, being able to help the client, the survivor to reduce his or her symptoms. It's because if your activated, uhm, the only thing that's gonna happen is you get re-traumatized, okay. And for me, a very interesting, uhm, ah, advance, uhm, that Ed put out there in trauma therapy is the reformulation of the identity because once you're traumatized, uhm, there is a label that you wear and some people don't see the label. Some people who are-- the people who do the trauma can smell that label and therefore there's a high incidence of people being retraumatized. I mean this is a, uhm, my own subjective way of describing but it don't happen. I tell my patient when they say, "Why, what happens to me? Why does this happen to me all time?" I said, "There's a kind of pheromone that only, ah, victimizers can smell and that's where you're targeted." So, identity reformulation is really most-- and I should have a watch with me. You know how I'm doing with time. Oh, good. Thank you. Thank you. Now can I see it? That's out of the question. Okay. No, I'm fine, I'm fine, thanks, thanks. Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks. 

00:16:50
Race-informed Trauma Clinical Model (Bryant-Davis & Ocampo, 2006) 1. Acknowledgment of racist incident(s) 2. Sharing trauma within a safe environment 3. Enhance safety and self-care 4. Grieve/mourn losses 5. Examine shame, self-blame, & internalized racism 6. Demand Equality Race-informed Trauma: Theoretical influences Orientation Liberation Psych Colonized Psych Folk healing Black Psych Trauma Rx Ethnopolitical Target oppression coloniality of power disharmony racism/oppression victimization conflict, warfare Goals liberation decolonization spiritual growth racial equity recovery reconciliation, peace Race-informed Therapeutic Assessment and Treatment PHASE Assessment Desensitization Reprocessing Decolonization Social Action GOALS METHODS 

00:16:50
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS And this is, ah, Thema Bryant's and, ah, Ocampo's model of race-informed trauma clinical, uhm, approach. The first thing that she addresses is, uhm, helping the client to reality test what happened. The, uhm, that he or she is a victim of racism okay. Once that acknowledgment is made, then there's a need to create a safe, ah, environment just like Ed Dunbar's, uhm, first stage. The third phase in this approach is to enhance the safety of the, ah, survivor and to promote self-care. That's the beauty that, that Thema Bryant-Davis had been talking most of her writings about self-care and that's something that people who have been exposed to trauma, that differs in their goals and that should be the first thing in okay. Uhm, this also is-- also acknowledge that survivors need to grieve and mourn their losses because when you have experience trauma there's a series of losses, some of them are invisible even to you as some of us know. The fifth stage in this, uhm, model is to examine shame, self-blame and in this particular case, internalize racism or internalize oppression. And the last stage in this model is a more sociopolitical action which is demanding equality, uhm, becoming the voice. The model that I'm presenting today-- I just wanted to orient you that again it takes a lot of-- as it only takes a lot of voices to tell a single story takes a lot of orientations to, uhm, inform a model and in this particular case I've been able to, uhm, drink from the fountains of liberation psychology. Colo-- psychology of the colonized-- for killing. Mainstream trauma therapy and there's no political approaches in psychology. And here it is. And, uhm, I'll try to go over some of these, uhm-- oh, we still have a lot of time, good. Uhm, some of these areas as you can see it's just like a-- I see this as a developmental process where we honor their work that had been done before and our role is to move it forward and then give them a time to you those of you who are interested in working in trauma. 

00:20:20
Racial Trauma Assessment ▪ Invitation to tell the trauma story ▪ Schedule a Racial Events (Landrine & Klonoff, 1996) ▪ Race-based Traumatic Stress Symptom Scale (Carter et al., 2013) ▪ Gender stress among people of color (Woods-Giscombé & Lobel, 2008) 

00:20:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS So, in this model when you do the assessment, uhm, rather than doing an assessment you are inviting the client-- the survivor to tell his or her trauma story. As trauma therapist we know that the trauma story comes out slowly for the long period of time. It doesn't mean you have to be in therapy for the rest of your life. It means that you as a therapist you need to have the patient to learn the language and to understand that sometimes the phase of the trauma stories a little be more glacier, interestingly glacier because some survivors become, uhm, ice. Does that make sense? I don't have to explain. Okay, good. Go, go. Uhm, Landrine and Klonoff did, uhm, very good work on developing, ah, on an empirical basis of Schedule Racist Events and I have found that scale, that idea because you know, some kinds don't like scales so you just take the idea and you said in the language of the client but being able to identify not only the triggering racist event by their host of, ah, history and sometime not even personal history but history of family, history of group, his-- historical perspective would harm you. Uhm, Robert Carter and his, uhm, colleagues also have done very good work empirically based on developing their Race-based Traumatic Stress Symptom Scale. That is very, very helpful because you have some-- it's a combination of not only psychological but, uhm, physiological symptoms and sometimes survivors are more conversant initially. Again, I could be wrong. You can tell me what your experiences with the physical symptoms that becomes the language of the trauma. Because it's easier to acknowledge and it's easier to communicate a significant others. And, ah, Woods-Giscombé and Lobel develop a gender stress, uhm, scale specifically tailored to people of color which I have also found very helpful going back to the intersectionality of, uhm, the realities of trauma and working with, ah, trauma-- uhm, racial trauma wounds. 

00:23:25
Racial Trauma Assessment Centrality of Event Definition The degree to which survivors being that the even became a core aspect of their identity Contributes to both PTSD (, 2010) and Post Traumatic Growth ( et al, 2013) 

00:23:30
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS I also suggest that in the assessment you pay attention to the centrality of the event and going back to Ed Dunbar's model the last phase was identity reformulation because the degree to wish people believe that that traumatic event becomes a core aspect of your identity is crucial in your work with trauma survivors. Now, the good-- the, the news that you already know is that the centrality of the event contributes to PTSD. What is really wonderful news is that the centrality of the event contributes to post-traumatic growth and that's my baby. Meaning, that's what I'm aiming at that trauma organizes into traumatic growth. That's my aim, okay. And that should be your aim too. Am I making sense here? Are we okay? Okay, no express on it. Everybody is okay here? Good. Okay. 

00:25:05
Racial Trauma Desensitization ▪ Stabilization ▪ Racial trauma assessment as baseline ▪ Survivors' hierarchy exposure ▪ Visualization & relaxation ▪ Naming a positive cognition for inoculation work 

00:25:05
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Well, desensitization that comes also from CB--ah, CBT and EMDR and, uhm, what all of the, uhm, trauma therapist and of course, what you aim is to stabilize to review symptomatology and then you start using the assessment that we were talking earlier the different kinds of assessment as a baseline. You also have a sense of the hierarchy then you can use to do some desensitization, okay. 

00:25:40
Desensitization: Self-healing ➣ Safe place visualization ➣ Healing visualization (healing light) ➣ Butterfly hug ➣ Self-directed eye movements ➣ Ethnic traditions--rituals, remedials, cleansing, ceremonies 

00:25:40
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Uhm, visualization, relaxation and we say, ah, guided imagery all of those mind body techniques work beautifully, okay. And again my experience is basic that-- well, my experience with the traumatize people but I have found that people of color re-- a lot of my clients of color really connect with mind body spiritual approaches. Just for you to, yeah, consider it. And of course, following the template, the protocol that Shapiro were calling of trauma therapy it's important that you identify it well, you know, you collaborate with the client to identify a positive culmi-- culmination. Yesterday, I was doing brain spotting with, uhm, one of my Latino patients and, uhm, the first thing he did was to say, "This is what I want to achieve." He came with a positive culmination, okay? That tells me a lot about the resilience of this client, you know. But he tells me about the beauty of this kind of approach, meaning, the desensitization and being able to identify early on in treatment, uhm, the positive, uhm, culmination because that's how you're gonna use it not only in accolade but to promote the post traumatic growth. Now, this is an order of my baby so I really-- I'm really into helping the client to connect with his or her self-healing abilities. I truly believe in this. We all have an inner doctor in fact we have a whole hospital inside. We do. We just have to connect with it and our roles is just to be the breach, to be the translator, to be the, the broker whatever you wanna call yourself just assist, okay. And again as I mention before healing visualization, you know, Francine Shapiro was able to say, you know, the, the healing light exercise of EMDR, you know, where she got it from? Yoga. That's a yoga technique. What I mean by that is we all have an array of strategies and beautiful tools from our ethnic and cultural backgrounds that we can incorporate into our work as psychologist or as trauma psychologist, of course, the butterfly hug. Anybody knows what a butterfly hug is? Does it feel food, okay? This is the butterfly hug. Are we, are we here? Okay. You know what that is? Supposedly what it is, is I don't know, oh, I'm, I'm-- what it is, is it brings you back if you allow yourself to, to when you were in your mother's womb and one sound is the beating of your mother's heart and the other is your own beating and that supposed to be, you know, there is some rebirthing therapies out there, I don't know. Have you heard about them? The point is that when people are very activated physical tossed that is non-aggressive calms you down and this by molarity and calms you down and if you accompany them with the positive thought then you can condition yourself so you can use it that thought, that sound, that's word. When you need like, you know, when you're doing a presentation like I'm doing right now, oh yeah, this is good. Yeah. Going back to the culture one of this is, uhm, I learned from, uhm, I was working with the a group of psychologist, ah, with the World Bank Organization because they have trauma and then they have to deal with the trauma in other countries so we were advising them and let me tell you our conclusion was. Our conclusion was that people in other countries know more about trauma therapy than we do and we were learning from them. Like in some part in Africa there's a song that people sing and that relieves trauma. So go back to Google and Google your culture and see what else you can get out of that rituals, ceremonies are wonderful. Why? It-- all of these if your client is amendable, of course, you know that's a given, you know, uhm, because rituals are a message to your own consciousness and the more your communicate with your own consciousness and everyone is on the same page so to speak then you can connect with your inner healer. Uhm, it's not good when one part of this going this way and the other one is going the other way. So, anyway, so integrating. 

00:31:20
Racial Trauma: Reprocessing • Positive cognitions (EMDR) • Ethnic healing--dichos, proverbs • Critical Consciousness • Sociopolitical understanding 

00:31:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Reprocessing, of course, we're familiar with that. Uhm, here what I would like to highlight and those of us that were-- with, ah, Latinos and with African-Americans with people who have some spirituality oriented those proverbs, those dichos, you know, the beauty dichos therapy that you have a dicho for everything. In fact, you have two dichos for the opposite so you're always right. You just have to know your dichos, you know. That's their reframe and that is flash therapy. Try it. You'll like it. Uhm, of course, because this is an ethnical-- critical approach it's important to, ah, work on developing critical consciousness because research shows this has been specifically with women but I think this applies to older too, everyone, that when people are traumatized and they have an under-- a sociopolitical understanding of why they were traumatize it-- it's not because I'm me, it's because I am used as an archetype for older as a model to inflict terror. So once you had the sociopolitical awareness it's easier to depersonalize it in a positive way and say, okay, it happened to me. What I'm gonna about it, okay? I have to get active and I cannot be paralyzed or immobilized as trauma does many times to people. 

00:33:00
Racial Trauma: Reprocessing ➣ Liberation psychology ➣ Critical analysis or racism and oppression ➣ Cultural resilience ➣ Psychospiritual transformation 

00:33:05
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Therefore liberation psychology does wonders. As I said before a critical analysis of racism, sexism, either of sexism, all kinds of oppression makes a lot of sense. It really helps you to ground yourself in reality. Another role that I see in my work at the therapist is to connect and promote my client's culture resilience, okay. And I'll be talking a little bit about psychospiritual transformation because those of us who work with trauma or if you have experienced trauma yourself or you vicariously traumatized or what have you it affects not only your physique, your emotions, affects your, your sense of self and your sense in the, in the well and your sense of connection because spirituality is the sense of connection to what, to whom, to where, it doesn't matter. It's the sense of connection. 

00:34:15
Racial Trauma Decolonization ▪ Development of agency ▪ Identity reformulation ▪ Post traumatic growth 

00:34:20
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Uhm, one of the things that I add in my approach is, uhm, decolonization. Even if clients have not being colonized even if they don't have a history of colonized Kenneth Clark the first African-American president of the American Psychological Association said that the situation of the African-Americans in United States is one of colonization. I happen to agree with that. And of course, we have talk about the identity reformulation and the post traumatic growth. 

00:34:55
Psychological Decolonization ▪ Racism as a form of colonization ▪ Colonized mentality 

00:35:00
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS So, if racism is a form of colonization what are more-- what about the colonize mentality? The internalization as Tim O'Brien, Davis and her colleague talk about, uhm, dealing and tackling the internalize racism. 

00:35:20
Coloniality of Power How structures of power, control, dominance, privilege that emerged during colonization continue to be prevalent (Quijano, 2000). 

00:35:20
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS Now this is an interesting concept, okay? And Quijano I believe was the first one to, to put it in words, you know. Coloniality of power relates to how structures of power, control, dominance, privilege, whiteness if you want to that emerged during colonization continue to be prevalent, continue to be prevalent, okay? We're talking about maybe colorism among our own colo-- uhm, among our own communities. What is that example of, uhm? 

00:36:00
Coloniality of Power & Trauma Coloniality of power exerts Eurocentric influence on definitions of trauma, traumatic stress, and treatment (Hernandez-Wolfe, 2013) 

00:36:05
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAS The reason I'm bringing this up to treatment of trauma is because according to Hernandez-Wolfe and I agree with her coloniality of power exerts Eurocentric influence on definitions of trauma, what is traumatic stress, what is PTSD and treatment. Incident and I mean those of us who are on this-- serve at the APA, uhm, there was a reason release of dressing America and what-- I'm so happy to say that a lot of psychologist of color reacted by saying, okay, this is great but what about racial stress. We're not in-- if not. So this is an example of coloniality, of power so we have to speak up and act. 

00:37:05
Racial Trauma: Social Action Healing through social action Diverse definitions of social action Community involvement, Testimony Restoring historical memory Sociopolitical involvement Spiritual activism (Anzaldua) 

00:37:05
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ It's begin by acting. Social action. I believe the social ans-- social action, social justice action is a healing force. I do. Not only they it go our way, ah, I think individually, that is a healing source. One of the things that I tell my clients is that you define what social justice is. I'm not going to impose what I think social justice should be. I mean, I'm in the-- in their range. I'm really much politicize so I am not going to do that because, you know, there are people who are on the other hand. And what is social action? You know, mothers can racially social and gender socialized our children. People can give testimonies or testimonial which is a political, ah, therapeutic approach developed in Chile. And I'm happy to say that, that, that it really, really works. The Chilean psychologists taught me that, that was valuable. Community involvement. You can become a promoter, meaning someone who promotes health and well-being in your community. You don't have to be Latina for that. You can be a promoter. Uhm, this concept of restoring historical memory is very important because-- what is the saying? Someone is gonna have to help me here. As above, below-- does that make sense? It sounds like a biblical thing. Means, whatever happens up there, happens-- are in macro and micro level. In other words, sometimes people are experiencing not happened not only to their ancestor but what happened to the whole group. I mean, there's always a, a connection there. And being able to connect your own personal story with the brother story isn't only empowering and healing, it moves the issue to another level, hmm, because you connect with all of that energy so it's more than you. I don't know how I am to ex-- explain it, but I have seen people transformed themselves when they, uh-huh. This what happens to my grandmother and this is what happened to the pe-- to my people. Okay. And of course, social political involvement. It's, it's that your cup of tea that would be wonderful. But it's what people need to do and what they want to do when they're able to do. You're not gonna have an undocumented woman getting into social political involvement at a-- of wrong place because she's gonna be sent back home, or whatever home was. Let me get back to Gloria Anzaldúa who was actually brilliant. Towards the end of her life, she spoke and wrote about spiritual activism. And one of the many reasons she did that is because if you work with trauma, sooner or later, you're gonna be dealing with the spirit, whatever is that for you, or the lack of spirit. There's a dimension out there that when we're doing our regular psychology in clinical practice, we meet-- we, we don't have to deal with it. But when you're dealing with traumatized people, it is the infamous elephant in the middle of the office, in the middle of the life. And my impression to the choir here-- am I making sense? Thank you. So that's the dimension that is always there whether you like it not. 

00:41:40
Spiritual Activism A combination of social activism with spiritual vision (Gloria Anzaldua). 

00:41:40
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ And Gloria Anzaldúa defined spiritual activism as a combination of social activism with spiritual vision. She has a whole writings about spiritual vision which is very, is very connected with, uhm, African American women and the prophetic, and the-- speaking the truth. It's, uhm-- she will call it corazonada, la facultad. Uhm, it's like a second sight. 

00:42:10
Therapist's Role To understand how a survivor's multiple contexts and identities shape their experience of and recovery from trauma. Laura S. Brown 

00:42:10
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ And I'm gonna go very quickly because I'm hurrying up time here for us. Uhm, Laura Brown said that to under-- that the role-- the min role of the therapist in this particular context is to understand how a survivor-- the survivor's multiple contexts and identities shape their experience of and recovery from trauma. And I will add to that, that that includes the therapist. Okay. 

00:42:45
Therapists Need to be careful when using trauma-informed therapies to not give survivors the message of adapting to a racist oppressive situation, instead of working towards changing the oppressive situation. 

00:42:50
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Important take home message for us who do this kind of work and that is, not-- it doesn't matter how much tool-- how many tools you have, how wan-- how many certificates you have on working with trauma victims. We all need to be careful that when we're using these techniques, we're not facilitating our client's adaptation to a racist oppressive society. Not only she's into a (inaudible ) society. And then we also have to at least convey the message, that in their own way, they are invited to work against to-- to work towards changing the suppressive situation in their own way. 

00:43:40
Therapeutic Relationship Cultural competence Expansion of clinician's role Cultural and spiritual humility Modeling social action 

00:43:45
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ So, what does that mean for all the therapists? We need to commit to cultural competence. That is the most whether you're a trauma therapist or not. You know, if you're a human being, you need to commit to cultural competence because otherwise you're gonna be fighting with your neighbor, with everyone in your life. Okay. We also have to expand the role of the clinician. It's interesting that I'm here and I feel very humble that I'm here because this is all about mentoring. Because one of the things that I do in my clinical practice is, I use mentoring. Patients-- some of our patients need mentoring. Okay. That's another story. How we do it? By mentoring. The other thing that's important for us as therapists, as psychologists, as human beings, as citizens, is to embrace cultural and spiritual humility. If you're not spiritual-- so I'm getting, ah-- sounds here to emphasize-- if you're not spiritual, that's okay, but you have to respect the spirituality of the other person. And I'm not gonna make mention to any of the news as an example. And we need to become models. We need to model social action. I'm not saying that you have to, you, you know, be out there and then share with your patients, everything whatever in Twitter, you know, I did this, I did that. No, no, no. That was not I'm talking about. When people are leaving, social justice action-- trust me-- it emanates. And you know what? Traumatized people have MRIs, uhm, x-rays-- they can read you perfect-- better than the schizophrenic. You know, some schizophrenic, ah, they can read your minds. Have you worked with schizophrenics by the way? Uh-huh. They can read-- ah, I wish I was joking. I'm not joking right now. I'm being serious. They can, they can connect with you, ta-ta. And they said, "Well, you know, I have this dream," and you say, "yeah, that was my dream."-- to yourself of course. That's the connection there. So, traumatized people, there are times that they can really connect with who you are. Okay.

"Civilization is a slow process of adopting the ideas of minorities." Herbert Prochnow References 

00:46:30
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ And-- oh, 2:45. Yeah. Perfect timing. I want to end by saying-- by agreeing with Herbert whom I don't know, that civilization is a slow process of adopting the ideas of minorities. Thank you very much. And these are some of the references. Thank you. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN The women that do the healing - 

00:47:10
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN - for the community, they know how to help - 

00:47:10
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN - to survive, how to get food, - 

00:47:10
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. Yes. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN - how to take care of the wounded, - 

00:47:15
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN - how to take care of the women - 

00:47:15
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN - that had been raped, - 

00:47:15
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN - and nobody asked them - 

00:47:20
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Exactly. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN - ever, you know, that organizations commit - 

00:47:20
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN - and provides services and nobody ever asked them what works. 

00:47:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. Yes. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN So how important it is - 

00:47:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN - to listen - 

00:47:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yes. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN - to that local knowledge. 

00:47:30
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yeah. You can see me smiling - 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:47:30
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ - because, you know, that when was working as a consultant to The World Bank with other psychologists, that exactly what we found, where there were women who were the healers and connecting and the-- and no one was asking them. We sort of because there were a few of us feminists, multicultural is there. We said, "What do the women say about this?" "Oh, we never asked." You're absolutely right. That, that has been my experience. I mean, we don't even have-- ah, ah, you know, when we talk about (inaudible ), you know, ah, the, the women in Chile who were weaving those weavings and they were sending messages, political messages of, ah, rebellions and sustaining and hope. Well, you have Las, Las Mardres la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina. You know, we, we have so many examples of that. When you have the womanist, uhm, psychologist and mujerista psychology, we're talking about the same scene. So, that-- you know, is that an area that you're interested in? That would be wonderful if you can continue to contribute to that. Thank you for that comment. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN When someone has a traumatic event, for example, and it is linked to their, ah, racial identity or their gender identity - 

00:48:50
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN - or some combination - 

00:48:50
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Uh-hmm. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN - when those, those identities are such a central part of someone's identity to begin with, how do you sort of address the issue? But I guess it's not allowed if you're disempowered and having those identities. 

00:49:05
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's it. That's-- that question is a whole presentation. Uhm, it is, you know, very, uhm, person specific. One of the things I do is I try to separate what was the identity before the trauma, what the identity now, and how does the person see him or herself without the trauma. Plat with that. Sometimes I use-- excuse me-- I'm going to-- I'm confessing today a what is called "feeding your demons" which is a Buddhist, uhm, band orienta-- it's a wonderful technique by the way. Basically, it's a shamanistic technique where you ask parts of the self and then you identify the part of the self that is identifying with the centrality of event and you have a dialogue through guided imagery. And the person starts to process it and integrate and then moves to a, ah-- an identity reformulation. So it depends on the person. Sometimes I use those techniques, sometimes I do something else like testimony and sometimes people hold on to that identity. There are many secondary games, so it's so complex but that's the beauty of this work that you are there accompanying the person in this journey and this process and being the witness. Hmm. Thank you for that question. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN For the potential for vicarious traumatization among African American men but also men of color and their families who are not necessarily targets of but worry about family members. Uhm, violence in the wake of what is now really heightened visibility about violence being directed at Black men and men of color by the police. 

00:51:10
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN That sort of people may be affected by it and not necessarily be aware that they are. 

00:51:20
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Yeah. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN But all of a sudden, whenever you pick up a newspaper, it happens someplace else. It happened somewhere else. It happened again and again and again. 

00:51:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN That's just kind of a barrage of that - 

00:51:25
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ Uh-hmm. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN - in the last couple of months. 

00:51:30
LILLIAN COMAS-DIAZ That is the question of the moment. The way I have found-- explain this for myself, and again, it could be my own stuff, is for me vicarious traumatized trauma, you know? And it b orders-- I see it as bordering probation intervention. In other words, when I see people that in their family someone has been victimized, I wanna see the whole family. I wanna make them an assessment. Because it's treating the vicarious trauma and is preventing and/or fortifying the members of that family who are all victimize. And sometimes, you know, that's it. Once an idea being put here is trauma can be invisible. There's a lot of people-- the word that came in my mind and I'm gonna say that-- I don't mean it that way-- is there are lot of walking corpses. Meaning, there's a lot of people who are dead and they don't know it because of trauma. And your role is to make them aware of the circumstances and start gaining that joy of living by overcoming that identity of traumatized and realizing that, "Oh, my god! I didn't know that! All this problem I have with sleep and my stomach and my IBS is trauma." We need to educate more about what is PTSD. I mean, that is the malice of the moment in addition to all their malices, you know, like, uh-hmm, okay. Now I'm gonna go there. But yeah, yeah, that, that's something that I've been drowning with because I see on those people with that situation, they're coming because they're identified patients supposedly but the-- what about your children? What about your family? What-- in particular, this kind of situation that we're living in today. Yeah. That's what we need. So, can we all work, try to do our little bit for that? Thank you again.
