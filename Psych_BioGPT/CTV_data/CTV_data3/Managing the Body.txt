DR. ANNA B BARANOWSKY Hi. My name is Dr. Anna B Baranowsky and I've worked with thousands of trauma survivors, helping them recover after trauma. What I found consistently are those who apply courage, discipline and perseverance in a daily practice to restore and stabilize do the best in their recovery. Their treatment path is aided by exercises that harness calm and they learn to apply the skills from their daily practice to the moments where they struggle the most allowing them to free up their energy to live their lives right now as fully as they can. If you're watching this practice, this is Day 1 of the 30 days stabilization practice, part of the larger Trauma Treatment Online Program and you're going to receive 30 video recordings from me with daily practices. Each message will be shown with a maximum of 10 minutes and will have suggested exercises or daily practices that will also be shown. I recommend that you do the daily practice either along with the video, it's interactive or on your own right after the video. So, please ensure that you devote a small portion of your day to set the right tone and dedicate yourself to your own wellbeing. Remember that not every exercise is going to be your favorite. But the ones that work have the potential to be game changers for you. So please try them all and give yourself the best chance to figure out what works for you. I like to start the practice first thing in the morning, but anytime will do as long as you're consistent. You can never expect to be successful at running a marathon if you don't practice running and recovery from trauma requires daily practice as well. So practice every day and return to the exercises throughout the day if you notice that you're struggling with your trauma history. These exercises are all designed to have you harness calm and manage your symptoms, so you can build a foundation of tools to help you during your recovery and beyond. Remember, research tells us, we need 30 days to change a habit into a new healthy practice. Start this daily practice today and take a small step in the right direction. Day one, daily practice: Managing the body. Let's start our Daily Practice Is Not A Luxury Item exercise from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Today's practice is managing the body. Everyone who has experienced significant traumatic event knows how powerfully, we feel emotions in our bodies. Well, those strong reactions get stored in the body and can reignite when we least expect it. Learning that this is a triggering response and that we can settle it down begins the process of trauma recovery. The start of managing the body must be with paying attention to our own internal world. Especially, as one client described the jumpy, bumpy feelings that represent a stress reaction. Shallow breathing, rapid heart rate, and the gruff or bumpy inhalation and exhalation for breathing rhythm. When we learn to pay attention to our breath pattern, we begin to lay the foundation of wisdom in our bodies and this in itself can help us to study our internal reactions, leaving us feeling calmer and more peaceful within ourselves. Let's start this exercise together. First ensure that in this moment you're in a safe and comfortable place where you will not be disturbed. Second, take a moment and just notice your normal inhalation and exhalation without changing anything. Take three breaths. Three inhalations and exhalations and notice is your breath smooth or rough? Deep in the belly or shallow in the chest? Slow or fast? Whatever you noticed, now apply your focus to make the breath smoother, slower and deeper, just by focusing. Do this now, three times and don't hold your breath at any point. Now continue with this practice slowing down the breath and focusing on allowing the breath to send a message to your body and your mind that you are safe right now. Shortly, you're going to see a breath trainer on the screen. Please watch the trainer for three minutes and allow yourself to just get into the rhythm of a slower, more restorative breathing pattern and practice this again throughout the day whenever you want to recapture feelings of comfort and calm. We hope that these daily practices make a difference for you and help you move towards your trauma recovery. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
