00:00:25
[sil.] 

00:00:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Good old days when we used to go down once or twice a year to Phoenix and talk to Milton Erickson. It was a unique experience. 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY To go there. When we were young and he was young and everybody was energetic. 

00:00:45
JOHN WEAKLAND And there was a new world to explore with him. (inaudible ) come again probably won’t, but even once is rather special. 

00:01:00
JAY HALEY It was a rare opportunity. 

00:01:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Sure was and maybe we ought to have a brief on (inaudible ) Gregory Bateson who made it possible. 

00:01:10
JAY HALEY To Gregory Bateson. (inaudible ). What's your first memory of meeting Milton? 

00:01:20
JOHN WEAKLAND My recollection is that you met him before I did. That you went to a workshop and that got the whole thing started and that I had not actually met him until we went to Phoenix for the first time. 

00:01:35
JAY HALEY You met him in Phoenix then? 

00:01:35
JOHN WEAKLAND I believe so. 

00:01:40
JAY HALEY Well let me recall how… what happened is I wanted to take a seminar on hypnosis for to study the communication in hypnosis as part of the Bateson Project. 

00:01:55
Bateson Project 1955 

00:01:55
JAY HALEY And I heard that that traveling seminar was coming to San Francisco. So I asked Gregory if I could go up there and learn some hypnosis to study. He asked who was giving it and I said, “Milton Erickson.” So he said. “I will call him,” and that way I found out that he knew Milton Erickson and had worked with him and Margaret Mead years before. 

00:02:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Somehow Bateson knew almost everybody, but you didn’t know he did. 

00:02:25
JAY HALEY So gone up or so he called Milton on the phone and said could an assistant of mine come up and take the seminar and Milton said yes and then Gregory laughed at phone and said to me. “That man is gonna manipulate me to come to San Francisco and have dinner with him.” So I said well since I was interested in manipulation, I said well, “What did he say to you?” And Gregory said, “He said to me why don't you come up to San Francisco and have dinner with me.” I'll never forget that. 

00:03:00
Gregory Bateson 

00:03:00
JAY HALEY Gregory was so concerned about the power of Erickson and his influence that even a straight statement from him he was uneasy about. I took that seminar and it was one of those where they lecture and talk and then demonstrate and then you work with fellow students to learn how to do it. Well, one of the things I really remember about that Erickson was talking to the group and then he wanted to demonstrate. So he said, “Someone in this group would like to come up and volunteer to be a subject,” and a muscle in my thigh just twisted like that. It was the most curios feeling an involuntary muscle. It almost pulled me up and then the guy in front of me stood up and went up. So I didn’t do go up, but I never had a feeling like that before. 

00:03:45
JOHN WEAKLAND If that guy hadn’t stood up reasonably fast, you might have been up on the stage then. 

00:03:50
JAY HALEY That’s right. It was a curious feeling. So then I came back and then we decided to put that as part of the project as I remember hypnosis. And then we started going to visit Milton and we managed a week a year at least. Well I think it’s from 1955 was the first visit. My last one was 71, I believe. 

00:04:15
JOHN WEAKLAND And you kept going for a good deal longer after I did not. 

00:04:15
JAY HALEY Sixteen or 17 years with him. Also, whenever he came to Palo Alto, he would call me up and I would go to his seminar. 

00:04:25
JOHN WEAKLAND Well you asked what's my memory of the meeting, the first meeting. I have a memory I am not sure it really was the first meeting. But its… its… its what's brought up with the question. I remember well I think I do. I was going into his house and him sitting there at his desk and leaning forward and saying, “All right. What is it that you want from me?” 

00:05:05
JAY HALEY I remember once when I went to ah… when after I went into practice and I went up to talk to him about how to cure people, that was the first line he gave me, he said, “What is it you really want from me?” Well that house I remember so well. It was a little brick house, near downtown Phoenix with three bedrooms and he raised six or eight kids in there. 

00:05:30
JOHN WEAKLAND That was very modest little place. 

00:05:30
JAY HALEY Yeah and for people flying in from New York and Mexico and from all over the world and his living room was the waiting room. So, the little kids were playing in the living room among the patients waiting. 

00:05:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh, I remember how very striking that seemed to me then. I had been in more or less analytic treatment in New York where you came in and then there was never anyone in the waiting room and you went out through a different door so you never saw any other patients or anyone in the family and to think that his kids were sitting in there playing with his patients, some of whom he described as really rather far-out people, was a revelation to me. 

00:06:10
JAY HALEY I remember his wife, Betty, saying to me once that a guy said to her, “You know I never dressed a doll before,” because Kristi or Roxie had asked him to dress a doll. He had a living room and a dining room and on the dining room table was all the stuff from the journal that he and his wife were editing I remember that. 

00:06:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:06:30
JAY HALEY And then he had this little office which was about 8 x 8 or 10 x 10 at the most anyhow, with two or three chairs, on his desk and some bookcases. 

00:06:40
JOHN WEAKLAND I remember we were just he and the two of us in there, it seemed to me to be rather full. 

00:06:50
JAY HALEY He liked to have people close enough so that he could reach them, that is what he said. He would reach out and take a hand and touch them. In those conversations with him, the air conditioner going, while we were recording and the dog barking outside, the dogs were barking and his wife hollering at the children it quite a background and that clock ticked, ticked, ticked over the desk. 

00:07:10
JOHN WEAKLAND All of that, was in his way also characteristic. He didn’t think that you had to get in a sanitized soundproof environment to do your treatment, for your hypnosis or anything else. 

00:07:25
JAY HALEY One of the… the things about our visits was that we stayed at a hotel downtown and then we would go spend an hour with him between patients. Then go back to the hotel, figure out what he had been saying, revise our plans on what we were going to ask, and then go back and spend another hour with him, and that’s how we would spend the week. 

00:07:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Well, we were always making plans and always revising the plans because he never exactly followed our plans. 

00:07:55
JAY HALEY He would tend to tell us what he thought was good for us rather than what we had in mind often. 

00:08:00
JOHN WEAKLAND It naturally had some relation to our questions and our plan, but it was not what you would call a direct answer. 

00:08:10
JAY HALEY That's right. He had a style of talking that you can never be quite sure whether he was talking about you personally, whether he was telling you about a case because it interested him, or whether he was educating you about the nature of therapy. All at once, really. He told us some great cases. You know thinking of that, I… was listening to a tape of ours a while back and I heard the first mention of an ordeal therapy I think. Because we both thought it was funny and apparently had not heard it before. It was a man who panicked when he had to go up to a microphone in a video studio, in a TV studio. He was a TV announcer. He spent about 15 minutes gasping for breathe and then go up and have to talk. And Erickson had him do gave him a theory about energy and access energy and had him do deep knee bends every time he was anxious and then had him get up in the middle of the night and do deep knee bends when he was anxious and we thought that was hilarious and after that I tried that in practice with him a number of cases and it was very effective, but I think that was the first mention of it and he mentioned it so casually not like this is whole procedure that I have worked out. 

00:09:35
JOHN WEAKLAND And I even remember that that was the first ordeal thing that we heard about. I would have thought it was… about somebody had get up in the middle of the night and clean the house it was (inaudible ) problems. 

00:09:52
JAY HALEY Right the old guys. 

00:09:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. And I remember that when I heard that like many things that I heard from Milton, I had a funny sort of a double take on the one hand, this is highly interesting and there must be something there, certainly seems to me like there is but I can’t figure out what the devil it is because this is so different from all the treatment I've ever heard in my life before. 

00:10:20
JAY HALEY That's the important thing really is what a contrast he was. Everything else that we knew about him I mean at that time we were studying therapy from a number of… of a number of people doing a lot of reading on it trying to examine the nature of it and his was so unusual that it was just hard to grasp and it’s hard to believe now because it seems obvious many of these things now, but at that time I mean to hear those tapes (inaudible )laughing at every once in a while or something he did, but now it seems rather routine really. Never quite routine. 

00:10:55
JOHN WEAKLAND No I think they were probably still on time (inaudible ) read about or hear about some of his cases. There are still times that I get the feeling there is something that now I'm grasping that I haven’t grasped before. 

00:11:10
JAY HALEY Yeah. There are so many things that he mentions that if you ask him about he then expands, if you don’t ask him about it he doesn’t mention. I don’t know if I ever told you this one. I mean we might not have discussed it. I remember that case of the couple who both went the bed and found each other and got married. 

00:11:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yes. 

00:11:35
JAY HALEY And they bought(ph) the bed jointly and he had him kneel on the bed and deliberately went to bed and lie down in that wed bed for about 30 days. Well one time for some reason just in passing I said, “Why kneel,” and he said well, “You're religious people.” They knelt by the bed every night and prayed anyhow. So yeah (inaudible ). Now even that was planned you know. I mean he could have had them stand on the bed or he could have done it in different ways. 

00:12:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I think quite similarly the story about the woman he had sit on (inaudible ) as kid it wasn’t till I had heard that from him the second or third time that it became clear that the woman also had a weight problem and this was in addition to everything else, a way of saying you're heavy weight. It can also be constructed. 

00:12:30
JAY HALEY Yes. It would make you positive thing (inaudible ). 

00:12:31
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah and I had not seen that point in it the first time through it all. 

00:12:35
JAY HALEY It’s so rich the way he works. Each detail becomes so important. If you… If you go into it if you don’t go into it you don’t even know its important, but… but we used to ah… when we cover well we tried to discuss with him. We were interested in the parallels between schizophrenia and hypnosis. Since schizophrenics had many characteristics of hypnotic subjects and we were interested in could you induce the hypnosis and schizophrenia in the same way. What are the similarities. And then we… we were first investigating hypnosis with him. Then we began to realize he had a whole new school of therapy that we didn’t know about and that’s when we got into what he was doing in therapy. I can recall that when I started the private practice as a hypnotherapist, I was… we had been… you and I had been (inaudible ). 

00:13:36
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm, hmm oh yeah. And holding meetings to practice and… 

00:13:40
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) 

00:13:43
JOHN WEAKLAND Hypnotic evenings over a long period then. 

00:13:45
JAY HALEY And I knew quite a bit about how to hypnotize people when I sat down to cure them that was a different matter it’s a different kind of hypnosis and that’s when I went to ask him about that. 

00:13:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh that’s where the whole difficult question comes up. Now they're in a trance what do you do? 

00:14:00
JAY HALEY The fact that research hypnosis and clinical hypnosis are not necessarily related at all. I hadn’t got through until that moment. He used to have hypnotic evenings in Phoenix every week. 

00:14:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes, I remember going to at least one of them. 

00:14:15
JAY HALEY I remember that’s where we… we recorded in the roof and then… 

00:14:20
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s right the one we ask him about in detail to make that paper. 

00:14:20
JAY HALEY I think that was the first paper, certainly on hypnosis, in which somebody is asked step by step what they did all the way through it. Since then, it has been done on therapy too. That was the first and he kept surprising us and that one what he was doing, what we thought he was doing was somewhat different. Do you remember what's the most unusual case you ever heard him talk about then? 

00:14:55
JOHN WEAKLAND The most unusual. 

00:15:00
[sil.] 

00:15:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Now that’s too difficult to question to they are just out of the air. 

00:15:10
JAY HALEY I remember the woman he had that was psychotic and had the young she was a schoolteacher with the young men floating over her head. 

00:15:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes. 

00:15:20
JAY HALEY And he had her put those young men in the closet in his office so they wouldn’t interfere with the school teaching and then when she was going to leave the city, she said, “What if I have psychotic episodes or whatever in the other city?” And he said, “Why don’t you put them in a manila envelope and send it to me?” And she sent him the whole series of psychotic episodes in a manila envelope. I think that was the most extraordinary case I ever heard of. 

00:15:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Which he finally filed away in the closet. 

00:15:55
JAY HALEY He filed away and he knew that she would come back and check if he had them and he saved everyone of those. He had a drawer full of them. In fact, I remember him pulling open the drawer and there was a whole bunch of manila envelopes in that drawer. 

00:16:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Well that one would be hard to top. 

00:16:10
JAY HALEY It was an extraordinary case and the quickness of that and you know how it was related. The idea of putting the… the young men in the closet was led logically to putting the psychotic episodes into the envelopes. It was putting something in something you know. 

00:16:25
JOHN WEAKLAND Just filing it away where it won’t get in your way. 

00:16:30
JAY HALEY I think she was also the woman who said there was a giant bear trap in the middle of the floor and he very carefully walked around that whenever she was in the room. He was so courteous to patients really. I have been teaching his therapy as “Courtesy Therapy” as a way of accepting and joining people and helping them pass it without making a confrontation out of it. 

00:17:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Well, it sure fits with that emphasis which I've seen more I think every passing year. Accept what your client offers you. Don’t get in an argument about it. Accept it. Do you remember, much later, the time he came to MRI and was doing a hypnotic demonstration with a young woman and her boyfriend heard about it and arrived outside the door boiling mad? 

00:17:30
JAY HALEY (inaudible ). 

00:17:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I think this was while you were still there. He did one of the most beautiful pieces of accepting and it had one of the most dramatic rapid change effects I ever saw. It was all very simple. As he finished the demonstration, he was told the young man was out there and he kept him out there. They weren't going to let him into the demonstration, but he was very mad and he wanted to know what are they doing with my girl in there. Erickson said, “Open the door.” And as the young man came pouring in Erickson turned to him and said, “I'm very happy to meet you and to find that there is still at least one young man in the world who is concerned to protect his young lady and be sure that she comes to no harm.” And the young man, all the anger was gone away because Erickson made no argument about it. This is wonderful. So pleased to see it. Yeah, but how many would do it that way? 

00:18:45
JAY HALEY He was so quick. You now I had a… 

00:18:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah this case came out like that. 

00:18:50
JAY HALEY At one time I think we were both there. A woman and her mother just came and knocked at the door and it turned out that it was a woman who had been in the state hospital and he helped her get out years before and she came to see him, just dropped in. So he came out and talked to her a few minutes and asked his wife to get a picture. He gave the girl a picture, was a Mexican girl and she was so happy to get that picture. He immediately sent for the picture. He knew exactly he should do that. Then he wrote something on it and gave it to her and she expressed her appreciation of him getting her out of the hospital and all, and then she went away. Later on, in passing, while we were talking about something else, he said, “Did you notice whether I signed that picture on the front or the back?” We had no idea. And he said, “Well the back of course. I made that decision very quickly because she is going to frame that picture, and then she will discover at that time that this is a personal message to her that no one else can see because it is on the back of the picture.” Now something like that happen so fast. I mean he had a matter of couple or three minutes with that woman in that dining room and he made a decision that fast and did all that thinking it all through. He knew he should give her a picture, that that would she would be pleased and it would help sustain her. He knew he should put a message on it and he knew it should be a personal one, not on the front where everybody can see it. 

00:20:15
JOHN WEAKLAND The front was for the world and the back is her private and personal information. 

00:20:20
JAY HALEY And he did that so quickly. He was one of the few men at that time, few psychiatrists around who covered the whole range of patients. I mean he was as comfortable with a raving psychotic as he was with a little kid that he was playing jacks with or an adolescent that he was talking with. He had a tremendous range. 

00:20:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I think part of it was not just that was okay, but that was positive to him, because he had seen and done so much that he was always in danger of I'm going to get bored if I don’t see something further, if I don’t see the whole range, if I don’t try to handle an old problem in a new way. 

00:21:10
JAY HALEY He would do a home visit, which other people wouldn’t do at that time. He would do an office visit to somebody. He would take somebody to a restaurant, as well as work in the office. That’s just it is that isn’t so uncommon today perhaps, but in the 50’s it was extraordinary for somebody to cover that range and to do work outside the office. 

00:21:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Well, I think at that time there were a great many people, in fact probably almost everybody else in the field, that were bound by a multitude of restrictions that they didn’t even recognize as restrictions and one of the things about Erickson in both his life and his practice is he was always getting rid of other people's limits going beyond them. 

00:21:55
JAY HALEY He believed his own yeah. 

00:21:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:22:00
JAY HALEY Sure. He had a way of making each case a unique approach. One of the things that he was so quick at was just observing people and diagnosing them and I was listening to a tape recently and finding out that in medical school, while he was getting his masters in psychology, he tested just about every mental patient in Wisconsin and just about every criminal in Wisconsin. He tested hundreds of people. So he covered so many kinds of people. He did this deliberately so he would learn about psychopathology of all kinds and meet a broad spectrum of it, while also making a living and so he did both. But a lot of people who are so casual about taking up one of his techniques don’t realize what a tremendously disciplined gathering of information about people he did for so many years before he sat down with somebody and then quickly did something you know. 

00:23:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Well, yes, I think they tend to look on Erickson as a magic worker, but this is absolutely antithetical to the way he worked, because he worked with a great deal of skill, care, calculation. The magic was only in that the art was concealed. 

00:23:20
JAY HALEY Sure. And he was so impatient with students who wanted to do things quickly before they understood the situation. I mean this whole magic hoax stuff around him where he waves the hand and people do things was really not what he had in mind at all about the nature of therapy. You really had to know your business. 

00:23:40
JOHN WEAKLAND I have often wondered, and you have mentioned of all this testing brings it up, how he ever found the time to do all the things he did, because he did a lot of things at enormous length like that. 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY That’s right and he would spent hours over some automatic writing… 

00:24:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:24:00
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) and so much time. The thing about him that in his own life he was as clever as he was with his patients. You know the way he handled the… the criminal situation. He got interested in medical school or internship or somewhere there in criminology. He did his first paper on criminology I believe. And the way he got a job in that was he started to provide on the desk of the big wheel in the criminal division in Wisconsin a report of all the crimes committed that week or something like… some statistical report on crime which interested Erickson, and he put them on the desk of this guy every Monday morning. One Monday morning he didn’t do it and the guy sent for him and said, “I want to speak to that man Erickson.” He said. “Erickson you are going to get fired if you don’t put this on my desk the way you have been,” and Erickson said, “You never hired me,” and that’s how he got a job. Was making him… first making himself valuable and then not doing it so the guy realized that he was valuable and hired him and that’s how he helped pay his way through school. Well He did so many things like that. He had such an ability to combine several things at once. Like the fact he mentioned in passing once that a doctor had told him for his allergies to live in Phoenix, but to get out regularly. So he lived in Phoenix, but he went did these traveling seminars regularly. So that was part of his professional life and also for his health. 

00:25:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Well that may be part of the answer to my question how he did do so much. That he made combinations so that he was always doing more than one thing at the same time. 

00:25:40
JAY HALEY He also worked very hard. He used to work what seven until eleven at night, seven in the morning through eleven in the night, he was seeing patients and then he kept weekends open for people who traveled long distances to spend two-three hours with him. 

00:25:55
JOHN WEAKLAND You asked about the most amazing case. This isn’t the most amazing, but it’s one that was… one of the most puzzling to me when he first told it. I think I have got some grip on what he was doing now, but when he first told this case, I kept thinking, what is that about? What is he doing there? A musician that came to him from New York, because he… 

00:26:20
JAY HALEY (inaudible ). 

00:26:22
JOHN WEAKLAND One that had to put on the performance. 

00:26:22
JAY HALEY Oh, that’s the one. 

00:26:25
JOHN WEAKLAND And he said, “I am just so anxious I can't do it.” And Milton spent nearly two days of the weekend he could be there. He spent almost all the time of nearly to the end giving him long dissertations about the need to be flexible I believe it was. 

00:26:50
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:26:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Long long stories about how you need to be flexible when you type and you need to be flexible when you do this and that and I kept thinking, what is… what’s… what’s the treatment here? And then finally at the end just before he finished and just before the guy had to catch a plane back to New York, because so that he wouldn't have any time to raise any questions all he could do was just go off, he had been getting the guy madder and madder at these long boring dissertations and then finally just before the guy left he said, “And if you with all your experience and training can’t walk up to the platform and play a piece, that wouldn’t be very flexible would it?” And I was flabbergasted. I was… it was another one of those things where… there is something very important here, but I can't quite get a hold of it. 

00:27:50
JAY HALEY You know there was another piece on that one. He first explained to the guy that he was tone deaf, he Milton was tone deaf. 

00:28:00
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s right. 

00:28:00
JAY HALEY And then he said, “Let me explain to you how you should play the piano. You should hit the keys with the little finger, a little harder than with the forefinger because the little finger is not as strong as the forefinger.” And for a concert pianist to listen to Milton who was tone deaf explain how to play the piano. 

00:28:15
JOHN WEAKLAND But that was the whole thing, he was building up. 

00:28:20
JAY HALEY That guy had to prove to him, by God (inaudible ) guns on him. 

00:28:25
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s right. He was building up the motivation of resentment, until that guy wouldn’t sit still for that final remark. 

00:28:35
JAY HALEY And the only way he could prove Erickson wrong was to perform well. Absolutely. 

00:28:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah but I think part of the difficulty was at that time, like everybody else I was thinking that you know there is good motives and bad motives and therapists work with good motives and therapists themselves are full of good motives like you understand and sympathize with somebody's difficulties and in that context you couldn’t understand Erickson’s treatment. 

00:29:05
JAY HALEY I know and the guy couldn’t disagree with him, everything he said was true, and benevolent and kindly and… 

00:29:10
JOHN WEAKLAND With a twist at this. 

00:29:10
JAY HALEY I remember him once saying that you had a great much greater chance of success with somebody who flew 3000 miles to see it because they had so much invested in just coming there. That they almost had to get over something because they'd put so much into it. You know what are the things he told us and this is a typical of the way he puts it. He said, “I'm waiting for a woman to come into my office who has had a very important pre-marital affair or is having a very important extramarital affair who doesn’t tell me that by the way she sits down in the chair.” And the way he put it was not women always tell me that. He says, “I'm waiting for the exception because they always tell me by the way they sit down on the chair.” He was always interested in the exception. But you remember the time he had us come in to the (inaudible ) we were in the living room when he told us come in the office and we came in this girl was sitting in the chair and we looked at and then he said (inaudible ). And then after she left he sat us down and said, “Well what did you see?” Do you remember that? 

00:30:25
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes I remember it little vaguely. I remember it, I don’t remember what I saw and what I didn’t see though. 

00:30:30
JAY HALEY Well I remember we said… “Well she was a woman you know.” Then we said she was in a trance and he said, “Well that’s true.” And finally he told us that we should have observed that the right side of her face was a little larger than the left side and the right hand was a little larger than the left. She had some neurological problems. It was evident to him and that we were expected to see and we failed the test. That was part of the way he set us up. He asked it in such a general way, what did you see, that we didn’t know what he was talking about the hypnosis, trance, this woman, the nature of life or what, but we sure didn’t do well. 

00:31:15
JOHN WEAKLAND I think that in all probability it was rather deliberate that he didn’t give us much hint and it was rather deliberate that he made us fail, because in some way I'm sure he thought that would be instructive and useful for us. 

00:31:30
JAY HALEY We would do better the next time. We would observe in the next time. 

00:31:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes. 

00:31:35
JAY HALEY Another resident I talked to that he trained. He would give them hell if they didn’t do a proper diagnosis and the next time they would observe the patient I remember that. He was great on observation. You know what are the interesting things that was hard for us to grasp in those days I think was that he took the way a patient sat down and the way a patient moved as a message to him, not as just an expression about the person and therefore he took that they were telling him something. You know it was Gregory Bateson's old report on command that wasn’t just a report about the nature it was a command to him of some kind and that was hard to see. That is he was so interpersonal in that sense that he took that as a… as a message whatever they did with him and we took it as well that’s an interesting person or something like that which is not the way. He was… He wouldn’t… He wasn’t able to phrase that what are they telling of me by the way they sit down, you know. 

00:32:30
JOHN WEAKLAND We were the ones who were supposed to be interaction, aren’t we? 

00:32:35
JAY HALEY That’s right. That’s true. And we have many arguments with him about whether something was interpersonal or not, but on that kind of a level he was absolutely interpersonal. We used to argue with him whether a wife was a symptom whether that was an adaptation to her husband who had the similar and the same problem and so on and he often or at least in the early days in the early 60s, was treating like an independent phenomenon in his description while behaving with it as if it wasn’t. That’s what was also throwing us. His therapy was absolutely interpersonal while his theory was not. 

00:33:15
JOHN WEAKLAND And he had the… let’s say the capacity to stick very tight to the view of his if you call it into question or even wanted to discuss it that was the same story when we brought down those ideas about similarities between schizophrenic behavior and trance behavior. He stood quite firm as I remember. 

00:33:40
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:33:40
JOHN WEAKLAND As he did in something I brought up to him many years later. I once after reading some of Carlos Castaneda's stuff, I wrote down and said, “I'm wondering if Castaneda ever met you because there seemed to be something's about the figure of (inaudible ) that are reminiscent,” and he sent me back a rather irritated message absolutely no and there is no such connection. 

00:34:15
JAY HALEY So many people now think of Erickson as a cult figure and (inaudible ) a bit like that because of the bad shape he was in, in his old age. But when we know he was young and vigorous and made a big emphasis on how you should control your voice, you should control your speech, you should control your movement and use all of that in therapy and that was what so it was so sad to me as he got older as he lost control of his speech and his movement. It's really a shame. I remember once saying to him, “I'd like to film, I’ll video tape him.” Just I want to just set up a camera in his office (inaudible ) and he said, he'd rather not because he didn’t wanna be remembered as an old man who couldn’t speak well and do his therapy well and then he let himself be videotaped and now that’s what people have, see him as an old man which is they see. 

00:35:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Well fortunately there's still a little from the earlier period around. 

00:35:20
JAY HALEY Also its fortunate that he was able to work as well as he did (inaudible ) handicap. 

00:35:22
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:35:22
JAY HALEY The people who came back saying this was extraordinary what they went through than we know. 

00:35:25
JOHN WEAKLAND Well in the sense its sort of the last repitimisation(ph) of his whole career. He's always been a man who does his thing by (inaudible ) handicaps. 

00:35:40
JAY HALEY Yeah, his whole life and he loved to tell a story by saying I had this impossible situation. (inaudible ). 

00:35:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah and after a while you know what’s coming here to how I did the impossible. 

00:35:55
JAY HALEY So a way he liked to present the case this and then he would lay it out of so impossible and then he would have it all solved. And the solution was usually so obvious once he did it. You remember that case of an inhibited (inaudible ) that he was telling us about. When he's talking she's the one who had the choking and gasping and was… it was related to coming on just before bed time. So he talks to her about all the things in the bedroom, the dresses and the drapes and then he said, “Of course there is a carpet,” and I said well, “We haven’t mentioned the bed,” and he said saying, “Of course there is a carpet that bed is mentioned. You only mentioned the obvious and when you say of course there is a carpet you're mentioning the bed by not mentioning it,” and he was so good at, I mean that again is so obvious once he said it, but it wasn’t obvious since that time, he never did mentioned that bed. 

00:36:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Well… Yeah again if you make too much of the point of something, it’s easy to either you resist it. And if he comes all around it, comes to mile in the way you can't resist because you are not pushing anything on you. 

00:37:10
JAY HALEY And he had this way of… of getting a participating in hypnosis by partially saying something. So you had to finish it and then when you finish it you were participating or if you do something incomplete as he would say it’s an incomplete mention. Therefore the other person has to complete it. 

00:37:30
JOHN WEAKLAND You always paid more attention to what you say yourself than to what somebody says to you. So he gets it started off you complete the message therefore you've told yourself and you gotto take that seriously. 

00:37:45
JAY HALEY You know there's… there's a film of him hypnotizing five women one after the other and there's a piece of that that we should look at because I think it’s as if I'm right about what he did and I talked to him later about it and I believe he was supporting it. It’s the most interpersonal piece of hypnosis I've seen. What he did was say to this woman, “My name is Milton. My mother gave me that name. It’s an easy name to write.” And as I watched that what seemed to be evident was that he was acting very young. Now one of the things he used to say about regressing somebody was that when you regress somebody back to childhood, you weren’t there. They have to make you somebody like a teacher or whatever and I think what he was doing with this woman is that he went childlike, she absolutely had to go childlike to join him, otherwise it didn’t make any sense that she was talking to a child in that situation and that the… that way he got her to regress was by regressing himself and I don’t think you could have anything much more interpersonal in that and that started working, you know. 

00:39:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I have often found that some of the things he does is look most simple. Other things you have to look at hardest to see what is the point of this. 

00:39:20
JAY HALEY He must have told us over the years, I don’t know a hundreds of cases as a way of educating us to get us to think as simple as he did about these things. 

00:39:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah, he would have an incredible amount of case material in his head that he could (inaudible ). 

00:39:40
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) he would associate to a case when he's talking about. 

00:39:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. Hmm… hmm… 

00:39:45
JAY HALEY So usually he had so many cases. The observation in his diagnosis was very complex but his interventions were simple. 

00:39:50
JOHN WEAKLAND And I think they got more and more so. 

00:39:55
JAY HALEY Yeah and I think as he got older they got more recommended. I mean the (inaudible ) work out better. I think he got more confronting as he got older and I think that makes people feel he was a more confronting therapist than he really was in… in our days. I think he confronted more when he had less skills of physical control perhaps. Because we remember him as a very accepting joining sort of a therapist and I think a lot of people don’t think of him as that way. 

00:40:25
JOHN WEAKLAND I remember him in the early days is certainly someone who of accepting also at the same time someone not who was confronted but someone who you could also readily be fearful of, because he was very easy to see he's powerful and penetrating even while accepting and that’s enough so that you can shake a little about it as a client. 

00:40:55
JAY HALEY As a client and as I think as his colleagues. I think his colleagues were largely afraid of him. 

00:41:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh I think a lot of them were, yes. 

00:41:00
JAY HALEY Because he did have such a reputation for indirect influence. 

00:41:05
JOHN WEAKLAND (inaudible ) Gregory that was worried about he has invited me to dinner. 

00:41:15
JAY HALEY They were pleased if he was benevolent, but little uncertain whether he was. I don't know if I ever told you about the guy who came to Palo Alto. A man came to see me and said, would I treat his daughter, and I said, “What's the problem?” He said well she isn’t… I have forgotten what it was she was depressed or something and he said, “I have been to see Milton Erickson with my other daughter and she's fine.” So I said, “Oh, why don’t you take this one?” The guy was a wealthy guy and well I said, “Why don’t you take this daughter to Milton?” And he said well, “I'm afraid to.” So I said, “What do you mean you're afraid to?” He said well, “When I took my other daughter there Dr. Erickson put me under house arrest in Phoenix for six months,” and he said, “I don’t want to go down there and spend six months again.” So I said well, “You know you might not have to because (inaudible ). And I persuaded him to take his daughter back the new daughter down and he did and Erickson didn't put him under house arrest. But apparently he kept that guy six months in Phoenix and you know that was a family that Erickson stayed with when he visited us in Palo Alto, one of the seminars he stayed with that guy and his kids. So they were on pretty good terms but the guy was scared to death of him really. I mean the idea of refusing to do what Erickson said was that didn't cross his mind you know. What power he had. 

00:42:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I saw Milton. I was an explicit patient only a couple of sessions, but I was scared. And to this day I cannot tell you exactly what he did with me. I can only tell you that a great many things changed within a year, year and a half after I saw him. I came home and got out of my analytic treatment forever and decided that I would see what I could do on my own. So that was the last time I ever had any therapy. And within a year, I had gone to the Far East where my wife's people lived first time where she came from. I had a major operation. 

00:43:40
JAY HALEY That’s right. You had that heart operation which you hadn’t decided about. 

00:43:45
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s right. And our first child was conceived. That’s a fair amount of things happening in a year. 

00:43:55
JAY HALEY It was a year. 

00:43:55
JOHN WEAKLAND And I don’t quite know how. 

00:44:00
JAY HALEY Did he discuss any of those things explicitly with you? 

00:44:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Well it is going to sound a little strange, but I am not too clear about what we did discuss explicitly. I don’t think I was in a trance the whole time. 

00:44:15
JAY HALEY You are a good subject. 

00:44:20
JOHN WEAKLAND But something happened. 

00:44:25
JAY HALEY And I am sure that there are things you remember whatever was wrong that you remember. 

00:44:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. But I am not sure that even Milton could take care of the ravages of the next 20 years. I mean I may have… may have had more at one point lost some of it by now. Go back to a minute to the business of he could be really rather stubborn about some of things we brought up. In a way, I think that is rather nice. Because the last thing that I think we would want to contribute to is the image of someone without flaw. Milton had his limitations and Milton was very human and thank God for that. He was not really the perfect guru sitting on the mountaintop by a long way. 

00:45:35
JAY HALEY Now, on his subject of hypnosis or influencing people, he was exceptional. But in other aspects of his life he was just an ordinary guy really. And he only occasionally dropped the professional attitude with us. Once or twice after dinner he was just a guy. But ordinarily he was in a professional stance with us, teaching us something all of the time really. 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:15
JAY HALEY But he was… bragged a lot and he had his flaws, that’s true. 

00:46:20
JOHN WEAKLAND You know he was just a man. Except for the bragging, he didn’t pretend to be anything else. 

00:46:25
JAY HALEY No. And he… the bragging was part of being just a man in the sense that he was consider himself well like others and had surmounted that. 

00:46:35
JOHN WEAKLAND There was one thing. I don’t know if it is a flaw, but we did run into it a couple of times and I think if you recall, couple of times we approached him what about your failures and he would say well I would be glad to give you an example and then he would give us the example, but sometimes at the last moment or rather every time at the last moment, the failure would somehow turn into a success. 

00:47:00
JAY HALEY That was (inaudible ) and brave. 

00:47:03
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah that maybe a bit of a weakness but… 

00:47:05
JAY HALEY He said at one point he didn’t see what you learned from talking about a failure unless you knew why it failed and then you might learn something. 

00:47:15
JOHN WEAKLAND He did have, I think a few highly fixed opinions, some of which I think I certainly saw it differently. I mean two or three stories I remember of him telling about cases that there is no point trying to do anything at all with that sort of case. I really certainly don't see those cases that way now and I am not sure I saw them that way then, but the way that his opinion was rather heavy then, well I think he just had some fixed ideas about that. 

00:47:45
JAY HALEY I think so. In a fact, you know Jackson said something that I thought was rather wise. Erickson had said I think it was about a manic-depressive that he didn’t think that guy was curable and Jackson said, well what he must mean is that with his technique he is not curable and that had not even occurred to me, you know. That he couldn’t reach him with his technique and I think that was probably so because the style of Erickson for that guy with that kind of syndrome he was a friend of Erickson as I remember. 

00:48:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Well, I think really the only point necessary is no more than anybody else people shouldn’t put him up on a pedestal, cover him in white paint, and nail a halo up. 

00:48:30
JAY HALEY He would have been the first to object to that, I think. 

00:48:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes. I am sure you remember the demonstration he put on with the hot sauce. So that in the curios way even when we were just in a social occassion, and he was just being a guy, he was still showing us that he was rather extraordinary guy. that he could call in that Mexican restaurant this stuff isn’t very hot. Bring me out something hotter. Two or three times until he thought, the kitchen was thinking this will set him on the fire and he was just having a spoonful of it, and licking it down. I presume with an anesthetized mouth done by self-hypnosis. 

00:49:20
JAY HALEY Had to be, he really had to be. Nobody could take that hot sauce with an ordinary tongue. But I think he did that self-hypnosis as part of his pain control and then he did it as part of that hot sauce control. He was a a guy… he always said that if he had any time at all, he could control the pain. When it took him by surprise, when the muscles wrenched away from the ligaments by surprise in those cramps, he couldn’t, but if he had a few minutes, he could do it. He had a lot of strength that guy. I mean, he would take two or three hours to put himself together in the morning so he could breathe and all that. But once he got himself organized, then he would wear us out, hour after hour after hour, talking. We were ready to go, when and he was still going strong. I was listening to a tape in which there a guy let’s call him Dr. G, who was an Erickson disciple. Dr. G went down there to set up practice in Phoenix and he was setting up a beautiful office in a high rise down there somewhere, and… and looking for a to do it properly and he was talking to Milton about this, he told me about this later. And Milton said well, “You know when I set up and practiced all I had was this little room and I came down here to work in the state hospital and we had a falling out, so I left and I set up a practice sooner than I expected. I didn’t have any furniture.” He said, “All I had in this room was two chairs and a card table.” So Dr. G said well, “That wasn’t very much to start practice,” and Milton said well, “I was there. What more was necessary?” And he absolutely felt that way. That’s why he could work in a train station or airplane terminal or… 

00:51:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah, I remember stories about his going through Chicago and there was somebody that wanted to see him so he had him come out to O'Hare Airport and he had half an hour and he talked to him right there in the airport lounge. 

00:51:20
JAY HALEY He used to do that. You know the only time I saw him express any reluctance at the burden of being a therapist was once when he came to San Francisco. He worked at the workshop all day and at lunchtime he had to see a patient or two, and then at the end of the day there was a woman waiting to see him and he said something like, “My God that’s a lot,” or something like that and then went off to see her and it was the only time I ever heard him object. Ordinarily, he would work all day, see people at lunch, see people before dinner, have dinner with his group there and then see a patient afterwards and that was on his workshop days. I think he had… Everywhere he went there were patients naturally and they would take the advantage of his visit to talk with him. 

00:52:15
JOHN WEAKLAND So that was his outburst. 

00:52:20
JAY HALEY And that was interesting to me because I knew the woman and I had talked to her. I was trying to get patients of his and talk to them privately about what the therapy was. Well she had an ordeal, I’ve forgotten, she had a one of her many problems was that she picked at her face and then picked the sores on it. And she also didn’t like beans. So she had to put in her bathroom by the mirror can of beans and she always picked her face in front of the mirror and as she picked at her face, she had to eat the can of beans. It was such a simple thing. 

00:53:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Trying two things together. 

00:53:00
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) was his sense of humor. He had a terrific sense of humor. 

00:53:01
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah. 

00:53:05
JAY HALEY So that most of the talking, about that grim business of therapy was funny really, what he did, what they did and the whole bizarre situation. 

00:53:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Well, I think that very probably we were rather important to him in that respect and that I don’t think there were many people he could let on how humorous he found things so that he would probably spending most of his life sitting there seeing patients, seeing things that he thought were very humorous where he had to keep the lid on it completely and with most of his colleagues as well and he could begin to let us see. 

00:53:40
JAY HALEY Sure. I think he really was looking forward to our visits. We brought ideas from outside to him and we enjoyed him so that… I mean we were a great audience for him when he was telling about those cases. 

00:53:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah he would have an incredible amount of case material in his head that he could reel off. 

00:54:00
JAY HALEY I was thinking of that musician with the fat lip. Well he used to have come in and yell at him. The guy was angry at his father, and Erickson had the guy come in and yell. He couldn’t play his horn because his lip swelled for psychosomatic reasons. The other guy come in and yell at him session after session. That was the one where he did that classical arranging the appointment without ever telling the guy the appointment. He said to the guy, “Well let’s see this is May, isn't it?” And the guy said, “What do you mean, May. My God this is June. Don’t you even know what month it is?” Oh! And then he said, “It must be about the 15th.” And the guy, “What do you mean the 15th? It is the 10th. I've got a psychiatrist who doesn’t even know what day it is.” Then Erickson say, “Well I suppose it must be about 4 o’clock now.” And the guy, “4 o’clock, its only 2'o clock.” At the end of the sessions, Erickson would open his book and say, “I am writing your appointment in and I want you to be on time,” and he would close the book. And the guy would show up on June 12th at 4'o clock or whatever it was and he argued that as long as he said that while the guy was shouting and it was so dropped in inappropriately to what the guy was saying, that the guy couldn’t figure and he also couldn’t refuse to come in because he never would told to come in. He hadn’t would told particularly couldn't be late because he never been told the exact time in a way that he could be late. 

00:55:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I seem to remember that in that case and in some others we would try to bring up something about the parallel between expressing anger at with you and anger at his father and largely Milton would just brush that aside. He was very curios what he would listen to and what he would just disregard. 

00:55:55
JAY HALEY We were trying to find out how he dealt with couples and families and sometimes he saw them together and often saw them separately and… 

00:56:05
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s right. So we were looking for a policy, a common line and what I remember is he well that’s this way and that’s that way and then again it’s the third way. 

00:56:20
JAY HALEY At one point, he would say that the sexual symptom is absolutely a couple's case. That’s the way he would treat it, like a couple. And another one like this inhibited Ann(ph) she has tremendous inhibitions and goes to bed and can’t have sexual relations because she has all this choking and gasping and all. When he gets her over that we asked him, “What about the husband? Isn’t there going to be some adjustment to the husband?” He said, “He'll have no problem adjusting.” So I said, “What do you mean?” He said well, “He rather passively accepted the way the wife was. Now that she changes he will accept the way the she is.” The fact that there was a contract between them wasn’t what he was thinking in that case you know. And we were trying to emphasize that, and he was just puzzled by it, really. Whereas with another case, he would assume it was contract. 

00:57:05
JOHN WEAKLAND And we never knew which way he was going to jump. 

00:57:10
JAY HALEY I think he partly hesitated to make a simple statement or a theoretical statement because it was too simple. That the case is a metaphor, contained all the ideas, he wanted to communicate. Any reduction of that case, down to a few sentences of description theoretically, would do a violence to the complexity of it, it’s almost the way he seemed to think about it. 

00:57:30
JOHN WEAKLAND But have less in that than the story. 

00:57:35
JAY HALEY You know there was a case that so describes him when he was in that hospital way back there (inaudible ) they had this violent black woman who came in and had been breaking people up before and she said, “I'm gonna yell for a while and then I'm gonna break a few bombs.” And she yelled and then she would stop and say, “I'm gonna yell for a while and then I'm gonna break some bombs.” And they had about six (inaudible ) who were afraid to take her on. And they called for Erickson and he came and she yelled. And she said, “You better not touch me Doctor. I'm gonna yell a while and break a few bombs” and he said, “I won’t touch you I want you to go on yelling.” And so she went on yelling. And then he took a syringe. 

00:58:20
JOHN WEAKLAND I think there was another step before. He said, “Okay, yelling seems to be your job I'm not going to touch you, but is it all right with you if I just do my job?” And she says, “You don't touch me, you go ahead do your job.” 

00:58:35
JAY HALEY He got permission. 

00:58:35
JOHN WEAKLAND He got permission. 

00:58:40
JAY HALEY And he took the syringe or whatever it was and when she had her mouth open yelling he squeezed it in her mouth and she swallowed it and then she stopped yelling and she said, “Was that sleeping medicine doctor?” And he said, “Yes it was, but I didn't touch you, did I?” And she said, “No you didn't.” And then she said, “Now there is a doctor what knows his business.” And I think he was a doctor who was doing business.
