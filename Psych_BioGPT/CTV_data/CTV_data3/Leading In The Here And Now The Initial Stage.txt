BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
This video tape is the first of a three part series which demonstrates leadership roles as the group process evolves. Throughout the process the leader periodically interacts with a group of observers to discuss the key concepts of group development. AACD The Association for Specialists in Group Work, a division of the American Association for Counseling and Development presents: GROUP WORK: LEADING IN THE HERE AND NOW Led by Dr. Peg Carroll, Professor of Counselor Education, Fairfield University Part I The Initial Stage 

00:00:00
PEG CARROLL  We're gonna be here for a long time, maybe six hours, not straight. Ah, you signed a release which has given many people permission, you've given people permission to look at this tape. However, it's going to be edited, and what I'd like to say, and then I, you decide how you feel about this is this, that I'd like to ask you, ah, when you leave or when you're chatting with anyone outside, and you go home and talk to your loved ones, that you not talk to them about what you, what anyone else said in the group. How you felt, what you experienced is perfectly okay, but I'd like you, to ask you not ever to talk with anyone about what anyone else said. 

00:02:20
 I think that I would feel freer to, uhm, it's gonna be more comfortable to know that it's just here. 

00:02:30
 Confidentiality is, is real and I agree with that, and, and this is being taped, I decide to get involved, I think, in a group and that would be okay. 

00:02:45
MARYANNE I think I've, I have wanted that it was being taped with all the lights. No, it, it's, that may be a bit more inhibiting. 

00:02:55
PEG CARROLL I'd like to hear from each of you on this. 

00:02:55
JEAN  Well, I, I'm (inaudible ). 

00:03:02
PEG CARROLL Who're you talking with? 

00:03:02
JEAN To Maryanne and Jenny both are. I, I'm not sure how I feel about the tape but I, ah, the confidentiality thing is, is, makes me feel comfortable because I know I don't know anyone really, except you and Jimmy(ph) and I probably won't see anybody again. So I wanna be just here for as long as we are and it helps to know that everyone is committed to being just here. And that nobody is, you know, pocketing anything and taking it with them somehow. I don't know. It's, it's hard to find the right words but I'm pretty comfortable. 

00:03:35
PEG CARROLL I'm not sure what, what you mean, Jean, ah, and when you said, ah, "putting something in the pocket and taking it with them." Can you tell me about that? 

00:03:45
JEAN Well, if the things that I experience here are finished somehow, I'll, ah, the one way to finish them is to talk about them some place else. So if we've decided and we'll only talk, I mean we'll only be with each other here and that's it, then this is my only chance. Hah. You know what I mean? I can't wait to figure out what's really happened. I, I really, I'll be more inclined to do it here because I know everybody else is feeling the same way. 

00:04:15
ART Do you think that if something is not finished here that, as you said, you might be able to carry it on elsewhere? Or is it. (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
PEG CARROLL All right. Can I stop you just for a minute? 

00:04:25
ART Certainly. 

00:04:25
PEG CARROLL Sure. You're talking to Jean. You're asking Jean a question. 

00:04:25
ART Uh hum. 

00:04:25
PEG CARROLL But I think the question has more to do with you... (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
ART Okay. 

00:04:30
DR. PEG CARROLL ...than Jean. Can you talk about yourself and talk to Jean in relation to that? 

00:04:35
ART Well, if I were ah, having something that. (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
PEG CARROLL But Art, no, you are right here right now. 

00:04:40
ART Okay, I'm here. 

00:04:40
PEG CARROLL Right. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
ART Well, that's why... (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:04:40
ART ...so I can butt in. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
 Okay. 

00:04:40
ART if I find myself having, ah, something that's unresolved, uhm, I don't know at this point, ah, whether I would do anything with it outside or not. But I feel comfortable that if it's not resolved, at least I give what I could here. 

00:05:00
BRENDA You know, maybe I misunderstood but I, I feel, Jean, ah, that it's all right after the group if we wanna discuss. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
PEG CARROLL Can you, say, talk to yourself, talk to yourself? 

00:05:15
BRENDA It's all right for me to talk with someone else about what I felt after the group, but it's not all right to speak with someone else about it. 

00:05:20
JEAN I, I myself. 

00:05:20
BRENDA  So I, I guess what I'm saying is if I want to discuss what happened to me today later, I can do that, although I can't discuss with somebody else that. That's why... (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
 Right. 

00:05:35
BRENDA ...I thought that made(ph) sense. 

00:05:35
 Yeah. 

00:05:35
ART I'd go, I'd go on with that. 

00:05:35
PEG CARROLL I'm glad you clarified that, Brenda, because I heard different things. I heard two different issues going on. And we have not heard from everyone in, in the group. Ah, I'd like to, I'd like to hear everyone respond. Who would you like to hear from, anyone? 

00:05:55
DENUDA I would like to, ah, I agree with that. I'm glad you brought up the subject of, of, of videotaping because, ah, I felt very uncomfortable. At this point, ah, it seemed to me it would be more easy for me to, to be in this group, uhm, although when I'm looking, this is, is hot. 

00:06:15
PEG CARROLL And you're saying, Jenny, you eased my feelings a bit? Is that what you're telling... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
DENUDA Yes. 

00:06:20
DR. PEG CARROLL ...Jenny? 

00:06:20
JENNY Yes. Uhm, ah, I feel better that, ah, somebody else is feeling the same way I do. It would seem, ah, might be more easy that I'm not different. 

00:06:35
PEG CARROLL Is Jenny the only one that you are, you are feeling a camaraderie with in the group, or is there anyone else you're identifying with too? 

00:06:40
DENUDA Uhm, Some of those people I, I still don't know, you know, you know. I agree with Brenda that, ah, if I, if I don't finish what is going on with me here, ah, I think I can talk with, ah, with somebody about my own feelings, you know, the, whatever I want to finish. I'm hoping to find something, you know. 

00:07:10
PEG CARROLL Have you heard from everyone in this group? 

00:07:15
DENUDA No, I didn't hear from Lucy and, ah. 

00:07:15
LUCY  Uhm, I don't know. I guess confidentiality wasn't even an issue for me. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
PEG CARROLL  It wasn't there, isn't it? 

00:07:25
LUCY It wasn't until you brought it up. 

00:07:25
PEG CARROLL  Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
LUCY Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
PEG CARROLL Good. 

00:07:30
LUCY because I, I just feel it with any other groups. 

00:07:30
PEG CARROLL And that's still an idea. 

00:07:35
LUCY All right. And I'll tell why. Every time I'm with you, I know that anything that is said is, is kept in confidence. And. (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
PEG CARROLL But you don't know these other people. I'm not speaking for me when I say this... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
LUCY Right. (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
PEG CARROLL ...is gonna be confidential. I'm asking for contract from everyone. 

00:07:45
LUCY  Uh hmm. I, I don't feel uncomfortable with that. I'm a member of AA and whenever I go to an AA meeting, I open my mouth and I say what's on my mind and I trust. 

00:07:55
PEG CARROLL Okay. So you had a, you've had a lot of very good experience in this, haven't you? (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
LUCY With trusting, yes. 

00:08:00
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:08:00
RON  I feel something a little different thing right now. We discussed in the beginning the confidentiality of our group and, and looking at it, this is a finite number of people. I mean I'm looking around, I see the number of people. There's maybe 20 of us. I feel comfortable with the confidentiality here with these people. I don't know what's gonna happen when this is shown, when there's an infinite number of people I have no control. I don't have any control here either but the control is where I'm not knowing when it's being shown, or to whom it's being shown. Right now, I'm, I feel comfortable with everyone here when they, you all tell me, yes, they will not discuss anything. But what happens when that film is shown and somebody looks on the film and said, "Hey, I know Ron," or I know Lucy or Jenny. I, I don't know. I feel a little uncomfortable, but not that it bothers me enough to not want to be here. Well. (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
PEG CARROLL  Anyone you want to talk to here that could help you with that, that you heard earlier? 

00:08:55
RON  Or maybe Jenny does. We signed the contract and you were apprehensive. I, I dunno, I'm just wondering. Will other people who they see this on signing a contract, I don't think and how do you feel about that. I mean do you feel the same way I do, that maybe those other people are the ones that we can't trust? 

00:09:15
  Ah, I haven't thought about trusting them. Uhm, I guess I'm, I would be concerned a little bit about how I'm perceived and, and that troubles me a little bit. 

00:09:30
PEG CARROLL Well, where are we with all of this. Can we move on or where are we? 

00:09:35
BRENDA When, when Ron and Jenny just talked about wanting to look good, and I said to myself, "Jenny looks (inaudible )." But I guess I want to look good too. I don't want to look bad doing this. And, and I guess that's why maybe I have to work that through so that I can really be myself in a group because I feel like that too. 

00:10:00
PEG CARROLL How would you work that through? 

00:10:00
BRENDA  By doing what we're doing right now, I, I feel like I'm, even if I probably looked comfortable coming in here, I have some anxiety too. And I guess as we're talking more on this, I'm feeling less anxious. 

00:10:15
PEG CARROLL  Anyone here not heard enough from any one member in relation to, I use the term "contract" in terms of the confidentiality issue. Anyone here would like to here more from any one member? 

00:10:35
[sil.] 

00:10:35
RON  Well, I, I don't know. I'm gonna empathize and feel with Brenda with what she said. I'm feeling, (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
PEG CARROLL Can you talk to Brenda? 

00:10:45
RON Brenda, I feel more comfortable that, ah, you are saying that you're feeling more comfortable that we talk about it. But when I'm looking, I'm looking at Jenny, Brenda, Lucy, and (inaudible ) and I see four people here, so maybe I'd like to ask with these four people. It would be Art, Arthur. (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
PEG CARROLL  Could you select one? Point there? 

00:11:00
RON Oh, I pointed him. You tell me, do you feel this comfortable as we're beginning to feel? 

00:11:00
ART  I, ah, I feel comfortable because I'm going through it. I don't think the, ah, the tension that I had coming in with was anything that I was seriously, ah, worried about. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
PEG CARROLL Well, where are you right at this minute... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
ART  I'm feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
PEG CARROLL ...right now? 

00:11:20
ART ...okay. I, I think there's a little bit of tension inside of me... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
PEG CARROLL Talk to him. 

00:11:20
ART ...as to, ah, what could happen, what's going to happen. 

00:11:25
PEG CARROLL  Where are you? 

00:11:30
RON I agree. I agree with all of that. I think how I feel, Art, is the tension that I had coming in is now turning itself around to more excitement for, for the group to get going and to, and get the process in motion, and it, it's starting to feel very good. 

00:11:45
PEG CARROLL And When you use that word "excitement," let's check with the group where everyone is right now in relation to that. Can you give a one word, adjective, as to where you are. I'm gonna start with you, Ron. You said "I'm excited." You're feeling excited? 

00:12:00
RON I'm feeling excited. 

00:12:00
PEG CARROLL Okay. Can we get one word from each of you? Just spontaneously, where are you right now? 

00:12:05
DENUDA I feel deep(ph). I feel I'm now at peace, at peace, uh hmm, and I don't have, I want to say that I'm very (inaudible ). 

00:12:17
PEG CARROLL One word. 

00:12:17
DENUDA Oh, okay. 

00:12:17
PEG CARROLL  What was the word? 

00:12:20
DENUDA Release. 

00:12:20
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:12:20
MARYANNE  Safe. 

00:12:25
PEG CARROLL Can you look at someone and, ah, someone will say it too. (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
MARYANNE Safe. I feel safe. 

00:12:30
 Relaxed. 

00:12:30
PEG CARROLL Would you talk to someone, not to me? (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
 Relaxed. 

00:12:35
 I feel more comfortable. Comfortable. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:40
ART Stabilized. I like it. 

00:12:45
JEAN For me, I think I feel intensive. 

00:12:50
JENNY  I feel a little enthusiastic. 

00:12:55
ART Hmm. 

00:12:55
PEG CARROLL  Finally, we have a sense of where the group is. Ah, there's a matter of issue too. Uhm, you're here and they are out there? 

00:13:10
JEAN Well, as I, that I thought, I, I was told that this could be the arrangement before I came but I was a little surprised by your concern about the tape, and where it was going, and how you would look because in order of priority, my worries are, first, what am I doing here? And secondly, there's other people here. And it, it didn't, even to my mind what is gonna happen to this out there some place because it, it just, it didn't, there's no anxiety for that. It's just too far away. I, I have no concept with what that, what everybody's gonna do with it or pull it apart or how they are seeing you. And I'm never seen that either. You know, I'm more concerned right here with how I'm perceiving what I'm, what I'm exchanging. So I guess that surprised me a little. You sound like you're very comfortable here and you're concerned about that other part. 

00:14:05
PEG CARROLL  When you say you're surprised, Jean, I'm not sure what you mean. You find it hard to accept where Ron is right now, or what, what is it that, that, ah, you're dealing with? 

00:14:15
JEAN Well, I wonder if, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
PEG CARROLL You're saying something about yourself? 

00:14:20
JEAN Yeah, you know. Where, where are my priorities? Where's, and my anxiety lining up in the right direction because we seemed to be exactly in reverse order. 

00:14:25
PEG CARROLL  Well, is there anyone you're connecting with here in the group, that you. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
JEAN Uhm, Lucy, when she said she was comfortable. 

00:14:30
PEG CARROLL She's right here. 

00:14:30
LUCY  Uhm, the first thing you said, you know. When I looked around with the people at the beginning, I looked, felt this could be okay. So when you said you were comfortable, I believed you right away. Just, just the sense that it could be okay to be here. 

00:14:50
PEG CARROLL And then when she sent a, a, or chemistry over to you, can you describe that? 

00:14:55
JEAN It was very peaceful. It was, it, it just validated a little what I felt, except when you said right away, you weren't too happy with that and his word out there. I'm thinking, huh, it didn't make sense. 

00:15:10
MARYANNE I agree with you, Jean, and that's why I said I hadn't really thought the videotaping that much. Uhm, and I would say that I, the reason I feel, one of the reasons I feel safe is I tend to give you pay, it's just a lot of, ah, authority in that I felt that because you'd selected the people that would be in the group, that is, and is outside of all of these people and most of the people I have met through you I trust. So I, and, and that's really how I came in here... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
MARYANNE ...that's where I end up, and I don't know if I'm giving you too much authority. 

00:15:50
PEG CARROLL I think you are. 

00:15:55
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:15:55
PEG CARROLL But as you said you're not comfortable with that. You're not comfortable. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
MARYANNE And she started having so many positive experiences because I've met people. I. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
PEG CARROLL  Wait a minute. Now you're getting out there. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
MARYANNE All right. 

00:16:05
PEG CARROLL Stay right here. (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
MARYANNE Okay. 

00:16:05
PEG CARROLL We are right here. 

00:16:05
MARYANNE Okay. 

00:16:05
PEG CARROLL Where you are. 

00:16:05
MARYANNE  Uhm, presently. 

00:16:10
PEG CARROLL What was the word you used earlier in terms of yourself? I forgot. 

00:16:15
MARYANNE Safe. 

00:16:15
PEG CARROLL You felt safe and you're talking about feeling you still feel unsafe. 

00:16:15
MARYANNE  Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
PEG CARROLL I guess what I want to say, I like the people here to make you feel safe more than my helping you to feel safe. I'm glad that I can help you there, but I would like you to feel safe among this group, all of us. 

00:16:30
MARYANNE  Well, I know some people in the group. It's really only Jean and Art and Ron, but I don't know them all. 

00:16:40
PEG CARROLL Well, well, as I said. You're here and, and they're out there. Ah, have I heard from all of you in relation to that? 

00:16:45
BRENDA  I expected that because I have seen, uhm, I'll talked to you, remember, when, because we have seen the fish bowl technique. So I expected there would be people on the outside. I mean, if, if, that's what you're asking is how I feel about that? I, I don't, I think it's, it's all right that there are people out there taking notes. 

00:17:10
PEG CARROLL And something that has not been mentioned that I feel I should mention is that out there, they're also part of the contract. 

00:17:15
ART I have a basic tendency to trust, ah, anyone right at, at the beginning. And I knew that there was gonna be a group outside of us and it didn't bothered me at all. 

00:17:25
PEG CARROLL  So you're, you're not concerned? 

00:17:30
ART No. 

00:17:30
PEG CARROLL Okay. All right. I'm gonna talk to them and (inaudible ) excuse me, I have to go away. Now, tell me out here what am I doing? What's going on, what am I doing? Debbie. 

00:17:45
DEBBIE Trying to establish the issue of confidentiality, how important that is in a very persistent manner in everyone to buying (inaudible ) 

00:17:52
PEG CARROLL Okay. Now, even though I am concerned about the confidentiality, I'm doing something else to the group. So I'm working in the group right now. What is it that you that I'm doing, Evelyn? 

00:18:00
EVELYN Well, one of the things I see is that you're making sure that everyone starts focusing on each other, instead of just you and yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:18:05
EVELYN You're saying even if they're not making comments, non-verbally they are making comments by just looking to you, and you're saying look at the person... (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
PEG CARROLL  Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
EVELYN ...speak to the person... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
PEG CARROLL Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
EVELYN ...and look directly now. 

00:18:15
PEG CARROLL Any? Eileen? 

00:18:15
EILEEN I think you're, you're trying to link also by having people identify with each other so they can feel that... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
EILEEN ...commonality and bonding is beginning to take place. 

00:18:25
PEG CARROLL Good. Anything else do you want to respond to? Yes, Pat. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
PAT You, you attempted to universalize people's concerns. 

00:18:30
PEG CARROLL Right. Okay. Very good terms, all of those terms. This stage is called, some authors call it "milling around." 

00:18:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
PEG CARROLL It's probably familiar to you. Others say it's the initial stage. Now, in the initial stage, there is a lot of, it's norm setting. Now, what are some of the norms that I'm setting? Oh we, and we haven't, haven't heard from, Jim? 

00:18:50
JIM I think the, the, the issue of trust, (inaudible )sort of the, the normal and you can trust entirely on slight because of the situation. It's a multiple... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
DR. PEG CARROLL It's a multiple problem. 

00:19:00
JIM ...problem, yeah. 

00:19:00
PEG CARROLL Okay. All right. Helen? 

00:19:05
HELEN You are also asking people not to ask questions. 

00:19:05
PEG CARROLL All right. (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
 Uh hum. 

00:19:05
PEG CARROLL What might be the reasons for asking people not to ask questions, Pat? 

00:19:10
PAT Well, you have people own what they're feeling here right now. 

00:19:15
PEG CARROLL Own, own, right. That's right. What other, what then else am I doing in terms of norms? 

00:19:20
KAREN I think you're trying... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
PEG CARROLL Karen? (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
KAREN ...to get people to stop intellectualizing and start bringing things in from outside the group... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
PEG CARROLL Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
KAREN ...to talk about what's going... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
PEG CARROLL Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
KAREN ...on right now. 

00:19:25
PEG CARROLL Okay. Okay. When we say "talk about what's going on right now," what is that process called? Ingrid, do you remember? 

00:19:30
INGRID  That you stay... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
PEG CARROLL Yeah. Right, you got it. 

00:19:35
INGRID ...right here in the now. 

00:19:35
PEG CARROLL Right. The "here and now process" that is very important. Now, there's a two-tiered process. A lot of what I'm doing, it comes from Young, although there are a few things that I would get into later that, that are not, uhm, not things that Young might be concerned about in running a group. And one of it has to do with authority which Maryanne brought up, and we'll see this demonstrated in a little while. Ah, this is an interaction approach here in terms of the group must interact. And when you said, I mean, you're, I'm asking people to look at each other and talk with each other, (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
PEG CARROLL that's part of the norm setting. Also, it does bring them into the here and now. That's the one tier. There's another tier that has to do with the process, that's interpreting the process with this group is, are they able to do that yet? Or am I able to do that with the group yet? That would be my question. Do you understand what I'm saying, interpreting the process? Okay, you know. 

00:20:25
PAT Well, I think everybody is asking the question who am I in the group? 

00:20:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
PAT I don't think they're ready to talk about the group as having its identity yet. (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
PEG CARROLL  Good. Good. How long do you think this takes for the group? This initial stage? 

00:20:35
INGRID It would vary with the people. 

00:20:35
PEG CARROLL  All right. Vary. Yeah? 

00:20:40
KAREN And also the size of the group. 

00:20:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
PEG CARROLL The size, right. 

00:20:45
KAREN I think that it will take a lot of longer if you have twice as many people you have... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
PEG CARROLL Right. 

00:20:45
KAREN ...and it will vary with each person. 

00:20:45
PEG CARROLL  Is this a good sized group, Helen? 

00:20:50
HELEN It seems like a good sized group. Nobody gets lost. 

00:20:55
PEG CARROLL Right, nobody gets lost. Okay. Now, ah, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move in again. Be prepared to, if you want to ask, I had said to you respond to the process but if you want to say it later why didn't you do this with someone, so rather than doing this, that's a perfectly okay question to ask. I had said not to discuss persons as such but I mean describing their behavior and interpreting what they're doing. But you can ask why I'm doing what I'm doing. Those would be good questions. All right. Now, you've learned something. You heard people outside talking. So where are you in relation to what you're in? 

00:21:30
LUCY  It was just broken down for me, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
PEG CARROLL Why don't... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
LUCY Jean. 

00:21:40
PEG CARROLL ...you select someone to talk to? 

00:21:45
LUCY Jean. Uhm, maybe there's a chance that I can go inside of, of what we've all been talking about, so they just broke it down to the trust issue and keeping it in the here and now just to refresh my memory, and that is somewhat. 

00:21:55
PEG CARROLL What would you like to do now? 

00:21:55
LUCY  Move away. (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
PEG CARROLL You wanna back out? 

00:22:00
LUCY I want to back out a little. I feel too close. 

00:22:05
JEAN Yeah. But I think it's probably because of one thing I heard from Peg at the very end, which was she just told me, we'll it's not a group yet. It's still individuals and I felt, I was starting to feel kind of like a group and she just, words on that and so I'm, I'm retreating, you know. 

00:22:20
PEG CARROLL  So what I have to say has a lot of power, huh? 

00:22:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. You want to talk to Jean? 

00:22:30
MARYANNE Well, that's what, yes, Jean. 

00:22:30
 You could. 

00:22:30
MARYANNE  Uhm, I think I brought that up before, yes, that, that, what Peg has to say has a lot of power because she said that it's not a group yet and I really felt it too, although it's moving into that. And I'm, I guess I want to move on. 

00:22:55
 Uh-huh. 

00:22:55
JEAN  Yeah. I don't think I, I'm not sure it's power. I assume that you know more about this process than I do, so that's the way I heard it. I didn't, I don't think I heard you tell me it's not a group yet, you know. I'm just assuming that my view might be mine. I haven't checked it with everybody, that's why I'm glad you just brought up. I was happy to hear you say you're feeling that you are not going back. 

00:23:25
LUCY  Physically. 

00:23:30
JEAN Yeah. No, I mean, ah, I trust to come in here but I don't bring with me a, a, a sense that I know everything about what's going on here. That will be the last thing I bring. So it's, it has some givens but I did feel that it was a little tighter and that jarred me. So once you, for me that Peg has the, that power is the right word. 

00:24:00
PEG CARROLL You're saying, "Peg, you're pretty important, you're pretty important," and Maryanne you're, you're saying the same thing, "Peg you're pretty important." 

00:24:05
MARYANNE Yes, but I really want to move back because my legs are uncomfortable. 

00:24:10
BRENDA  I, I and Maryanne feel pretty much like you feel about how important Peg is. I don't know how you would have trust and when, when Peg said that about, well, to the outside people, well, you'll, you'll, you said something, well you'll see how will I deal with the learning. That's what stuck in my mind. I say I wonder when she's going to do that, and now I feel like Peg is doing that. And, uhm, I very much feel that Peg is the authority. 

00:24:45
PEG CARROLL  And can you tell me that? 

00:24:50
BRENDA Yeah. I feel that you are the authority and that you really know about this... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:24:55
BRENDA ...and I think that it's all right for me to trust you with that. 

00:24:55
PEG CARROLL I guess that I'm uncomfortable with that but I'm glad you could say it to me because I want you to say, I want you to be who you are. And when you tell me that I'm an authority and you tell me that I have a lot of power, what you're both really saying, as in Jean a little bit, "You're more important to me than the members." 

00:25:15
MARYANNE All right. I'm gonna have to give you, ah, the power right now. That's why I moved back because I was really, thought I was gonna crash into your knee. And, ah, but I think, and I know I'm not, I'm not supposed to have that out of hand. (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:25:31
PEG CARROLL You wanna stay right here. Oh. 

00:25:31
MARYANNE  I would like us to move on. I really feel like I trust you and the other people, even though some of you that I, I don't know well, and I don't need Peg to protect me. 

00:25:45
PEG CARROLL Can you tell me that? 

00:25:45
MARYANNE Peg, I don't need you to protect me. But then... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:25:45
MARYANNE  that still goes back to it, that I trust you're judgment, and you selected the people. I have to be honest. 

00:25:55
JENNY I don't feel that way. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
MARYANNE  Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
JENNY Ah, ah, it isn't that just that I don't trust her but, uhm, ah, I have to trust people in the group. I'm not, I'm not there yet. I don't trust anybody yet. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
PEG CARROLL Who do you feel comfortable with? Could you talk to anyone you feel particularly comfortable with yet? 

00:26:20
JENNY Sure ah, it's hard to say that, I guess, who I feel comfortable with because I heard from you, Lucy. I thought you really risked a, a lot in your first statement when you said you belong to AA, and I thought I'm not sure that in a group where I did know anybody, that I would've been willing to trust enough. Uhm, and so I guess that what I see in you is a lot of strength as a person, and I like that. And I thought, wow, this is a really strong person and I'm going, uhm, going to be comfortable with, you know. And maybe we'd be able to do some work, you know. I, I like to have, ah, good points with everybody but I'm not, I'm not really totally trusting yet. But I, I feel good where I am and I feel that I'm, you know, when we move on with it that I will really trust more. I mean I'm comfortable with anybody here. 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:20
PEG CARROLL  Who are you gonna talk to, Denuda? 

00:27:25
DENUDA I'm not sure we'll be back in... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
PEG CARROLL  Oh, try "I am not sure." (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
DENUDA ...uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
PEG CARROLL It depends on what you're gonna say. 

00:27:30
DENUDA Uhm, I think that we're going to when you said that this is not a group yet... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
PEG CARROLL Hmm. 

00:27:35
DENUDA ...because I felt like we, you the one who established the rules in this group. You were the one who had said it's okay for us to be here. You were the one who said that. (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
PEG CARROLL  Can you change it to "I was the one?" 

00:27:50
DENUDA I, I was comfortable with all of this, yes, (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
PEG CARROLL And I was the one who said what? 

00:27:50
DENUDA  oh yes. And then you just stand up for a while and kind of summarize with other people the rules of this group and then you said there's no group yet. And I felt like, you know, I felt that I am part of this group because I said that I trust. Uhm, and I said that it's okay for me to be here and then to be taped and to be listening. And it was okay. And I rather appreciate everything you have to say and contributing Brenda, and Jean, and Lucy, and Jenny, and Art, and Maryanne, and I feel comfortable now that I can say it because it is very difficult to make this decision, to do it. 

00:28:35
PEG CARROLL Good. I'm glad you said that. I'm glad you said you resented that. Now I get the sense that you wanna really be in there. 

00:28:40
DENUDA Yes. I want to move. 

00:28:40
PEG CARROLL You wanna move. 

00:28:40
DENUDA  Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
RON Denuda, I, I think I agree with that statement because just trying. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
PEG CARROLL You want to talk to me or Denuda? 

00:28:50
RON Well, I want to talk to Denuda that I agree with you, but the feelings that I have are almost the same as with Peg... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
RON ...when everyone is saying "you have the power" and you're saying I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
RON I feel you do, and then here's to the point where I may have resented that you said this is not a group. I, in essence, gave you that power... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
PEG CARROLL Sure.(crosstalk) 

00:29:10
RON ...and I, I, I don't know if I want that. 

00:29:10
PEG CARROLL All right. You want to take it away? 

00:29:15
RON I don't want to take it away. I, I. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
PEG CARROLL Why not? 

00:29:15
RON Well, maybe away from you. 

00:29:20
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:29:20
RON I'd rather that you. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
PEG CARROLL Glad you could tell me that. Good. 

00:29:20
BRENDA  I'm glad that Ron said that because. (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
PEG CARROLL Ron is right here.(crosstalk) 

00:29:25
BRENDA I'm glad you said that, Ron because when, when Peg said to me that you want me to protect her, I, you know what, I have a problem with that. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
PEG CARROLL You, you couldn't tell me that, huh? 

00:29:40
BRENDA I'll tell you that. 

00:29:40
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:29:40
BRENDA I'll tell you that I did. I had trouble with you saying that you, that I want you to protect me. 

00:29:45
PEG CARROLL But it was hard to say it then. It's easier now. 

00:29:50
BRENDA Yes, it's probably easier because I heard from other people and I just feel even more relaxed... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:29:55
BRENDA ...than I did before.(crosstalk) 

00:29:55
PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
BRENDA Because I'd really feel that it's okay for me to trust you with that. I, I feel it's okay for Peg to have some, some of that power in order to, to be the leader of this group. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing for me. I, I'm just wondering what Denuda... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
DENUDA I think, (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
BRENDA ...can say. 

00:30:15
DENUDA ah, I think you're comfortable, ah, with the statement you are making. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
BRENDA I'm comfortable, you mean? 

00:30:20
DENUDA  comfortable, although, uhm, I think, ah, I, I see the group and I trust Peg and I trust you. Ah, I trust you Brenda and I don't know, I don't know what you're asking me for. 

00:30:45
BRENDA I guess. (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
PEG CARROLL Okay let's stop. may IU ask you, what's happening? (inaudible ) 

00:30:50
 I mean our struggles with authority issues. 

00:30:50
PEG CARROLL Okay. What does that mean, power struggles, authority issues? Anyone? Jim? 

00:30:55
JIM What is the leader's role. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
PEG CARROLL What is the leader's role. Good. All right. What is, what is it that the leader was doing in here? I'm, I'm saying what am I doing here? 

00:31:05
JIM Okay, you said, I think you're drawing the issues there. 

00:31:05
PEG CARROLL  Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
DENUDA Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
PEG CARROLL Drawing the issue. I mean what's the issue? I mean you said something. What's the issue, Pat? 

00:31:15
PAT We can get beyond of being a client to being good participants to the tape in order to put the group again. 

00:31:20
PEG CARROLL Okay. And you said this on earlier. Debbie? 

00:31:20
DEBBIE You want them to become more aware of each other... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
PEG CARROLL All right. 

00:31:25
DEBBIE ...and move away from there a little bit. 

00:31:25
PEG CARROLL A little bit? 

00:31:25
DEBBIE No, a lot. 

00:31:25
PEG CARROLL  Okay. Who in the group, now, well I don't want to ask that yet. Ah, if it's important for you to watch and see who's doing what? All right. Who's doing what in the group? What is it that, that, that, ah, must be resolved here. This is another theoretical issue in terms of dealing a group or one that is very important to me. It may not be important to all leaders but for me to have, to have long term goals. But for me to reach those long term goals, I also have other goals. Certain things that I want to create to happen so the group can move on. What is it that I'm creating him? A thought? Yeah, put your hand this way a little bit when you do. All right, we don't know, whether this we will know. Ingrid, yeah? 

00:32:10
INGRID Group cohesiveness.(crosstalk) 

00:32:10
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:32:10
INGRID It's when, when Denuda challenged you, and that forced other people to decide. In doing, relationship would have found. 

00:32:15
PEG CARROLL Okay. But, that's fine. However, group cohesiveness is something a little different than the challenge is right... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
INGRID Uh-huh. 

00:32:25
PEG CARROLL ...when there the challenge was made, what am I doing that let's the group. 

00:32:30
EVELYN I see modeling... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
PEG CARROLL Evelyn. 

00:32:30
EVELYN ...going on. 

00:32:30
PEG CARROLL All right. Okay. 

00:32:30
EVELYN  And the modeling that I'm hearing is that you're saying, first of all, thanking her. Thank you for saying you're resentful. 

00:32:40
PEG CARROLL Good. 

00:32:40
EVELYN So it's perfectly okay to be resentful and said that you, ah, just broaden your whole horizon, what feelings are... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:32:45
EVELYN ...permitted for this group. But I, at the same time, you're saying you people are, I feel this and you're saying to Brenda, uhm, you know, I feel you attempted about filling it up because you're giving her, kind of, ah, pointed comments to extend your feelings of, first, can I stay here and second, it's, it's more than superficial. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
PEG CARROLL  Uh-huh. 

00:33:05
EVELYN And that's so that's a little piece of the modeling. And finally you're saying, don't keep looking at me. Don't give me the power, look to yourselves. You are real people. You're throwing back all that power. Each of you have as much power as I am, I feel like your saying. And every time they keep going back to you, you keep saying, "No, no, no, you don't have to come back to me. I don't want it to be mutual, uhm, safe giver. Make yourself safe. Give it to each other." 

00:33:25
PEG CARROLL Okay. All right. Now, as a leader, the group, can the group at this point yet move on? Yes or no. You don't know yet? All right, let me change that. Certain things must me resolved before, even the group says let's be a group, is it ready to be a group? Any thoughts? Anita. 

00:33:50
ANITA If you're talking about they becoming a group, (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
PEG CARROLL All right. 

00:33:55
ANITA they have to work through first. 

00:33:55
PEG CARROLL All right. What is it they have to work through from my perspective right now? You mentioned it, I think it was Betty. What is it they have to work through, Betty? The very, very first. 

00:34:05
BETTY The authority. 

00:34:05
PEG CARROLL The authority. All right. Now, what, do you know what I mean by that, the authority issues? Helen. 

00:34:10
HELEN Well, it seemed like the two things that have been going on is their issue of trust and authority, and I think during the, during the first part everybody was talking about how to trust. (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:34:20
HELEN There were, and how much they trusted you. And then started challenging you and, and playing around the issue of whether they probably trust or they don't want you to have all the power. And so I am talking about that. 

00:34:35
PEG CARROLL When a group such as this group and many people have said, I trust, I trust I trust each other. I trust people. That's a danger signal. That's a term that begins with R. What is it? Resistance. All right. When you hear them, I trust everything. Do you think that people by their nature trust everybody and everything? No. No, they don't. So let's look at the authority issue. Do you think that each person in this group has resolved this? As a leader if you were sitting here and you said, this is our goal, I've got to get this out in the open. Do you feel that everyone has resolved this? You don't, all right. Who here do you think has resolved it the most? Anyone? 

00:35:20
 Denuda. 

00:35:20
PEG CARROLL Denuda. Okay. Now, let's go back. 

00:35:25
BRENDA Jean, when, when you spoke before I missed it because I was concentrating with Denuda. But stuff with me I really wanted to move on and say because I felt like, we just met and you must understand something else happened with me. 

00:35:40
JEAN Well, I feel like I want to, I want to know. I, I have a sense of you. I want to know more of you and really welcome you in. And I'm, I'm aware that I'm trusting people differently and this whole issue is, ah, it feels like it's in the way. So when you said I like to resolve this too, I thought it was the only thing I could think of, you know that. 

00:36:05
PEG CARROLL So, there is something in the way here. 

00:36:05
JEAN There is definitely something... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:36:05
JEAN ...in the way. 

00:36:10
PEG CARROLL You got your hand on it? 

00:36:10
JEAN Well, it's, uhm, I feel that you're neutral. I really feel that. So when you said something about the group not being a group, I did get it and it affected me. But the clues from this people have much more. 

00:36:25
PEG CARROLL But where are your feeling is because I am concerned about you. 

00:36:25
JEAN Okay. So I was very tentative and then... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
PEG CARROLL Where are you now? Let's not go back. Let's stay right here. Where are you right now? 

00:36:35
JEAN ...I'm not, I don't feel so trusted in here. 

00:36:35
PEG CARROLL You're not trusted? 

00:36:35
JEAN No, because... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:36:35
JEAN ...I don't know anybody else with my sense of, of what's important. There's something more important to me than the words you say. 

00:36:45
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:36:45
JEAN It's the feelings that I get from the people here. 

00:36:45
PEG CARROLL  Good. (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
JEAN And, (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
PEG CARROLL And then (inaudible ) 

00:36:52
JEAN and I wanna hear more from them. And those feelings were the only one so far and some from Denuda that appeal to me and Jenny. I heard from Jenny too that I felt very comfortable and very safe. And, (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
PEG CARROLL Very real. 

00:37:00
JEAN and very real. And I can feel I'll go with that. If I had a choice between Peg's words and the feelings from these people, I'd go, I knew if someone here said that, I was right there. It was very clear on where, (inaudible ) you know. It validates my feelings because this feeling place to me. So Brenda, I, I, and I sense there's something here and especially if you are sensing something (inaudible ) 

00:37:26
PEG CARROLL You're not feeling Maryanne's presence. You're not feeling Brenda's. (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
JEAN Well, I feel, I'm feeling yours slowly and as more things happen in here. So I was happy you said that because I want to, and I'm not sure what's happening about it. I don't feel you're real sometimes. 

00:37:45
MARYANNE Hmm, interesting. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
PEG CARROLL What's happening? You said interesting. 

00:37:45
MARYANNE I don't know. I don't know what's happening because all of a sudden I was feeling very tired now, and that's not like that you would, but I'm, I'm really feeling tired and you threaten me tremendously. 

00:38:00
JEAN Well, I, I like to hear from you.(crosstalk) 

00:38:00
MARYANNE Yes. 

00:38:00
JEAN  You're, you're much more important to me. 

00:38:05
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:38:05
JEAN It's, that's, I think that's what's... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:38:05
JEAN ...upsetting me. 

00:38:05
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:38:05
JEAN  Our feelings here and yours too. You know, I, I have good vibes sometimes. I'd like to hear from you. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:38:15
JEAN I'd like to hear how you feel. I'd like to, uhm, join you. This thing is, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
MARYANNE Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
JEAN it's in your way and it's in my way of knowing this somehow, so. 

00:38:25
MARYANNE I didn't realize you're the only one that I feel threatened by and I feel you're very cognitive. I don't know what's going on I think, but I, I want to withdraw. And it's not gonna, I don't think it's that I don't trust everyone. I think I'm afraid of my own feelings. I think I'm very vulnerable. 

00:38:40
BRENDA  When you said that to Maryanne, when you said, is it Maryanne, I want to almost jump in. I know when you talk about feeling, ah, or by just being vulnerable, it just, it just really hit me very hard. 

00:38:55
PEG CARROLL Let's see if anyone else has her feelings? 

00:39:00
RON I, I agree when Brenda at one point. Maryanne, when you were talking to Jean, I wanted to jump in. My feeling is that you were, you were judging. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
PEG CARROLL Oh, wait a minute. Okay, hold it. Ah, you're not gonna do it, I'd rather that you did not describe Jean's behavior but that you talk about yourself only. 

00:39:20
RON  I, maybe I, what I'm trying to say is I felt hurt that you would single out certain people of who to trust was and then somebody who you didn't trust. 

00:39:40
PEG CARROLL Are you talking about yourself? 

00:39:40
RON Well, I wasn't included in the list. 

00:39:45
PEG CARROLL Yeah. Okay. We left you out. 

00:39:45
RON Yeah, you left me out. 

00:39:45
PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:39:45
RON  But when Jean what you told Maryanne, it does, it added more ammunition more to my feelings and they, they came up more to the surface much more rapidly than they probably would have. 

00:39:55
PEG CARROLL  Where are you in relation to Jean right now? 

00:40:05
RON I guess instead of if you don't want to trust me and I'm questioning should I trust you? 

00:40:15
JEAN I'm not really happy about that. Uhm, I don't, I don't feel with you right now as I'm feeling with Maryanne and... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
PEG CARROLL You're not connecting in the same way really, is what you're saying, but you are feeling it with Maryanne. 

00:40:35
JEAN  it felt something and she showed it, and I got it. 

00:40:40
PEG CARROLL  You were touched. 

00:40:45
JEAN Yeah. 

00:40:45
MARYANNE  I guess it, ah, surprised me when you said that, what I heard you saying was you're not real, that (inaudible ) was real. And I heard you say something before, Art, that my tendency is to trust people right away. 

00:41:05
ART Uh-huh. 

00:41:05
MARYANNE And my tendency is to do that and I can get hurt a lot. Sometimes I feel I'm too open immediately and that, that makes me vulnerable, you know, and sometimes, first, I don't, I don't think I give a good impression exactly on me. So when you were saying that, it just kind of I guess reaffirmed that with me. 

00:41:30
JEAN  That's not what I meant. I am sorry that it came across like that. I'm really sorry. If anything, my need was to feel you there and, and, we, you know, you're right, we somehow caught and this issue is, you know, is trying my patience. (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:41:50
JEAN Well, where have you been all these years, I mean you, and, you know, and I don't know these yet and, you know, that time is going by. So that was not what, when I said I didn't feel so real to me. That's not the sense that I meant it. 

00:42:00
MARYANNE But it helped me to know that I was being real. You know, I'm impatient like you. I can feel that. 

00:42:10
PEG CARROLL What I'd like to find out now is where you are? Where is the group right now? I'm not sure. Would you tell, would you state who you are connecting with the members of this group? Anyone begin, who you're connecting with? 

00:42:25
ART I'm connecting with Jean and Maryanne. I really didn't want you to go away from the group and I began to get a feeling that it's the group beginning to leave me. And, and I didn't want that to happen. 

00:42:40
PEG CARROLL Anyone else want to say who you're connecting? 

00:42:45
DENUDA Art, I can relate with you. 

00:42:45
PEG CARROLL Oh, there, hold a minute. Without, I just want you to say who you're connecting with without describing, and that we can come back to that... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DENUDA I think... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
PEG CARROLL ...who to connect. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DENUDA ...I could with Maryanne. 

00:42:55
PEG CARROLL  Can we hear from all of you? 

00:43:00
LUCY I connect with Maryanne too. When you picked up your chair and physical moved out of the circle, something inside of me went oops. And something inside of me wanted to do the same but I could feel you pulling away. And when you mentioned the word vulnerable, that touched me. And I could see, it's visible, it's touching you too. (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
PEG CARROLL Well, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
LUCY That was my impression. 

00:43:20
PEG CARROLL ...I don't remember what you thought but I like those to come out of the discussion like I said. 

00:43:25
DENUDA  There was a moment when, ah, I think I resolved the issue with what is okay in this group and what has never came in this group by what happened between Jean and Maryanne. I was a part of the discussion and, or expressing your feelings and I'm very glad, Maryanne, that you moved in back to the group and then you told Jean how you felt, because there was a moment when I felt like, Oh to say where I am sometimes to somebody else maybe won't be okay. I could hurt somebody... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
MARYANNE Yeah. 

00:44:05
DENUDA ...you know. So when you returned to the group, I already, I feel comfortable right now with this. It seems okay to be both ways. 

00:44:15
PEG CARROLL Both ways how? 

00:44:15
DENUDA I mean, to be yourself no matter where you are right now. 

00:44:20
PEG CARROLL Oh, no matter where I am? 

00:44:20
DENUDA I. 

00:44:20
PEG CARROLL Yeah, okay. Where are the rest of you connecting? 

00:44:25
BRENDA I do with Denuda right now, a lot, because of what you just said knowing that I'm also like that. Almost like I want to open right now. I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
PEG CARROLL Denuda has helped you? 

00:44:40
BRENDA Yeah. 

00:44:40
JEAN  I'm, I'm connecting with almost everybody but what I haven't resolved with Ron yet. 

00:44:45
RON  Okay. 

00:44:50
PEG CARROLL Go ahead. 

00:44:50
JEAN Well, uhm, I didn't hear some more opinions from you when we started that I have with that. It's not unusual. I mean, I'm used to that. But I don't, I'm not hearing what you want from me on a feeling level. I'm hearing that you have to be included. You want me to include you when I, whatever it was I did at that particular moment. And I, uhm, I don't know how to respond to that. Every word you said, well you left me out. And I, that happens to be one of the things I have a lot of trouble with. So that didn't make me more like reaching out, whereas what Maryanne did, didn't make me feel more like reaching out. 

00:45:45
MARYANNE I feel totally in different way about you now. I feel like there's something that, that was, there was a barrier that's gone, you know. 

00:45:55
JEAN Definitely. 

00:45:55
MARYANNE  So I'm glad that you said what you think. So it was being in front of that or, you know, they got me back in the group. So I thank you for it. 

00:46:05
JEAN Thank you. 

00:46:05
PEG CARROLL  Well, can we stop here for a minute? This is what I, you may have some questions but you may have some observations. I guess what I'd like you to talk about is what's happening? What are you seeing? Eileen 

00:46:20
EILEEN They're working on the solution on conflicting, potential conflicting. Well, helping people to confront each other about their feelings, about each other. 

00:46:30
PEG CARROLL Well, you said about resolution of conflict. Now, I don't really think you mean I don't want people. I want people to resolve all their conflicts. That's not what you mean, do you? 

00:46:40
EILEEN No. What I, what I mean is you want to bring forward their issues with each other. 

00:46:45
PEG CARROLL All right. Okay. 

00:46:45
EILEEN But not that they need to resolve them but get them on the table... (crosstalk) 

00:46:45
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:46:45
EILEEN ...and get that out, and let it be a normal. But if you say... (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:46:50
EILEEN ...you can in fact confront. 

00:46:50
PEG CARROLL  Okay. What else do you see? Anybody? 

00:46:55
 Uhm, I have a question here. 

00:46:55
PEG CARROLL  Sure, hmm. 

00:47:00
 Can we ask some questions? 

00:47:00
PEG CARROLL Yeah 

00:47:00
 Why did you ask Ron don't describe Jean's behavior at this time. What is your point in there? 

00:47:05
PEG CARROLL Okay. All right. That, maybe, someone on the outside could answer it. What, you're gonna say, Jim. 

00:47:10
JIM It's setting a norm for feedback... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
PEG CARROLL All right. Okay. 

00:47:15
JIM ...and that when you get feedback, your reaction is not the same as the other person. 

00:47:20
PEG CARROLL Good. We have two things that was said. One is labeling which is something that we want to avoid. The leader wants to avoid any labeling whatsoever. And also, it's setting the norm for the behavior. Now, the norms that you set as leader are very deliberate. Deliberate, deliberate, deliberate until you are sure the group knows the norms. Now, there are, in terms of the norm, norm setting. They're not discreet, which things, you cannot predict how things are gonna happen. What often happens with a group is they start getting mad all the time, You gave one thing we can do in the beginning, now you're telling us how do we have to behave all the way through. That's what I'm saying to you in terms of the norm is set. The question, Evelyn's question about why did you not let the behavior be described is a very definite norm. There's another one. Who asked earlier about questions? Earlier, way back, you said you're not letting questions being asked. What's the norm for that, Helen? What's your thought on it? 

00:48:15
HELEN  Well, its' not asking question because of what Pat said earlier on owning your feeling that's been described and listening to, to the labeling. 

00:48:25
PEG CARROLL  Right. And it's very important to point out to the members your question is related to you. Now, when you say that to someone, what happens to the person? Anyone who wants to respond to that? What happens to the group member when I say that? 

00:48:40
 They go inside and think about themselves. 

00:48:45
PEG CARROLL They go back to themselves, which removes it from. Now, let's look at the same thing in terms of, yeah, Helen? 

00:48:50
 It goes through a, it takes the person who's been questioned off the spot. 

00:48:55
PEG CARROLL Okay. Good. It takes them off the hook. Which then gives a norm back to the group. You are not going to be questioned. Now, let's get back to, yeah, Evelyn? 

00:49:05
EVELYN I want to just say something I think that was lovely that you did. You were fair... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
PEG CARROLL  I was fair. (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
EVELYN ...when you said, well, Lucy, I gave, sometime Lucy got a chance to talk and you said wait a minute but can you give others, give you the chance. 

00:49:15
PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:49:15
EVELYN Therefore, I will be fair to each of you. I'm not playing safe with this. 

00:49:20
PEG CARROLL All right. 

00:49:20
EVELYN I think the issue of fairness is vital to the group and it's a norm itself, yes. 

00:49:20
PEG CARROLL  That's another norm. That's right. You see, as you're leading, you're thinking I am modeling, I'm gonna let them know what I'm going to do all the time. Now, in the beginning, the leaders are very active. The leader has to, in fact, the leader probably should be saying more words than the members because you're setting the stage. You're setting the stage. Later on, when this group starts moving along, they'll be less setting the stage. 

00:49:45
PEG CARROLL  Sure. 

00:49:50
 When you did the who's connected to who... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:49:50
  and sort of shows you the impact. 

00:49:55
PEG CARROLL Sure. 

00:49:55
 I'm not sure what do you make of that? 

00:50:00
PEG CARROLL Perception? Good question. Because this what often happens. When you let two people go on too long, you'll lose a group. And I was beginning to worry about the group itself. And the important thing is, two things. The group is in here and now but if you only stay in the here and now, the group will really leave here and go wow, was that a good experience? But the learning takes place sooner than the interpretation of the process. This is what Young talks about, calling, reflecting the self reflected loop he talks about when you start reflecting back. But if you've reflect too soon, you'll lose the here and now. So, you have to teach the group to be in the here and now. The self reflected loop is impossible yet because I'm still setting the stage and the group must be, must be a, it's interactional, I would say. But is it a social micro cause of itself yet? Not yet. No. Any other questions or comments? Yeah. 

00:50:55
EILEEN About physically having people being very close together so they're almost touching knees. I'm not sure when Maryanne said I don't like touching our knee or whatever, I need to move back. Is that because in fact they're too physically close and that's threatening? That's how part of how I interpret it that it was too much to ask them... (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:51:20
EILEEN ...to get that close so soon? Is that what you think. 

00:51:20
PEG CARROLL Right. Well, a lot of things occurred in that. That is my need as a leader. Not every leader, some leaders would give a lot of space. I find it very difficult to operate unless its' close so it's only my own need. The other part is that Maryanne was saying you're very important Peg. You're proper but boy, did she do it. The only one. As Lucy said, she disobeyed the rules. You moved back, I didn't. But I wanted to do it. And Maryanne says, you know, that's why I moved back, the heck with you I'm gonna do it anyway. Because she was uncomfortable. But if the whole group started doing that, I'm not sure what I would do. But I would like it to happen because then there's a real dealing with the authority in the group. The authority issue in itself that has, has to be dealt with. Did I answer your answer question, all right? 

00:52:00
EILEEN Yes. 

00:52:00
EVELYN  Do you want my comment? 

00:52:05
PEG CARROLL Anything. Sure. 

00:52:05
EVELYN Okay. One of the things I observed is you did not take the bait. Remember people used to work impatient and there's a clear message like let's do something else, let's move on. There was just no way you're really gonna kick that out and say okay let's keep going. You have those issues to resolve in a group of people you want to solidify. And I think, you know, you say I don't wanna be premature. So, even though everybody's tantalizing with these little words, you know, people (inaudible ) 

00:52:31
PEG CARROLL That has to do with goals, you see. You have to have goals but your goals are processed goals. Now, you have a few little people goals too. You look at the people and say I can count on that one. This person is resistant. I can intimidate this person. I mean, you know, it's how I might use human loss to people purposely, because I know that I can risk that with each group. So, I'm deciding about people but that is something that changes with every group you work with. The process doesn't change. You're, you're, not that every group works. Believe me, they don't. That's something that that's very important for you to know that many times, and I've had many, that just absolutely failed. No matter how much experience you have, that doesn't mean that its' all gonna work. But in terms of your experienced, what is important for you to do is to have some theoretical notion about where you're moving along. In the long run, I'm looking for certain things that you incurred. But there's one thing that I'm looking for about all else, and it's really an existential notion. For me, it's enough. And it's for people to be authentic. That's the only thing that I'm looking for. Now, the (inaudible ) say that groups have, He writes about groups that have very very goals, and that is to change some kind of behavior that they have here in the group. With some people have talked about, they've said this is a problem for me. A few people said that. And then to make personalitychange, that I'm happy enough that if the person has a sense of authenticity and then feels then that they can move on, in transfer that outside, that's enough. I think its' very important when you're running a group that you not have goals that are so high. I learned to have fewer and fewer and fewer expectations. I don't mean goals. My expectations are very low. And, but you see, authenticity is really not a low expectations. That's a big expectation. Have you seen anyone out, yeah, Gail? 

00:54:25
GAIL When you're talking about authenticity, I, it appears that you must be walking some kind of a tight rope because a lot of times you immediately reinforce some behavior that you see. But I don't think we can assume that you don't reinforce behavior that you're not thinking at the top in it. I have a sense that they were several times that I wanna say I think this person is talking words that they think they should be saying, they've had some experience saying those kinds of things and I think that's what the group wanted, wants to hear. 

00:55:00
PEG CARROLL Wants to hear. 

00:55:00
GAIL Other times, I get a sense that it's authentic. How do you move the group toward authenticity? 

00:55:05
PEG CARROLL With a ladder. Yeah. If a person does not understand that he or she is intellectualizing, I'm gonna hammer and hammer and hammer them to death. And finally, that you see, I do a lot of the work for the group in the beginning, and then the group works itself. And how I resolve that? If you bag to anyone too long, you'll lose them. So sometimes you have to let something go. And eventually, the group members are not ready to say hey stop talking, you're in a hit. You're in a hit. Any questions or comments you wanna make about the process at this point? Okay. Lets' take a break. Oh wait a minute. Ingrid last question here. Okay. 

00:55:45
INGRID While I was listening to this whole a lot of questions, I was thinking in my head that, uhm, how interesting was that at the beginning people have said, Oh I'm trusting and trusting and it was like I knew that many of these people have had experience in groups before and felt they trust the group process. But then when you push the issue with them individually, that there's been a lot of distrust as well. And I was thinking that you are forcing them to shift. They say it's generally global trusted you to really checking one another out. (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
PEG CARROLL Right. 

00:56:10
INGRID And then they're finding the hand, I'm not also trusting this one or that one. It's been that's where the work is happening. I always thought at one point I would have, my feeling would have been to move on and then I realize that had, had you moved on based on their trust at you, they would have never really had the foundation to move on. 

00:56:30
PEG CARROLL Correct. I am really, that's important. And really what the long term goal is when this group is through, that they will walk away and not remember anything I said or did to help them but they will remember each other. You see, that's the long term goal. When ever, as I said earlier, whenever your group say I'm very trusting, I said it was a danger signal. What did I, remember what I said it was? What's the word? 

00:57:00
 Resistance. 

00:57:00
PEG CARROLL Resistance from the group. Which is normal natural resistance but all, what I'm doing, Oh it is a nice safe friendly group. Those who scare me to death. They really like to have a rabble rouser. You want something who can (inaudible ) was gonna screw things up all the time. Nice people do not make interesting groups. And at that point, we'll stop and have a break. Okay?
