ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Hello. Welcome. Hi, I'm Annellen Simpkins and I'm the moderator for this wonderful panel that we have today. We have Mary Pipher, we have Jack Kornfield, Don Meichenbaum, and Peter Levine. So, let's begin now and welcome them in Post-Traumatic Disorders. 

00:00:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uhm, they've asked me to begin, ah, and I promise to leave them some time. Ah, which a bit-- Okay, uhm, ah, I, I gave a workshop on treating PTSD the other day and enumerated the variety of diverse populations, uhm, involved in where trauma comes into play. With regard to combat soldiers, people have been victimized in the aftermath and natural disasters and the like. I just came back from Canada where, ah, in the last seven days, four service members who have taken their lives, having served in combat. Ah, I, ah, presented and consulted recently at the trauma clinic in Boston where they were working with the victims of Boston marathon, ah, and, and presented on, ah, treating individuals with prolonged then complicated grief. I worked with native populations and the like. Here's the interesting piece to this. Ah, I, I just make a few quick points. No matter what traumatic event that you look at, whether it's combat, natural disasters, victimization, what have you, motor vehicle accidents and the like, the overwhelming and consistent finding is that while people are impacted by those events, 75% of the population will go on an evidence resilience, and in some instances, even evidence post-traumatic growth. Our job as mental health workers is to discern what it is that characterizes those 75% versus the 25% who are going to show PTSD complex, PTSD in a variety of comorbid disorders. Any model of the impact of trauma on individuals has to have within their framework what distinguishes those two groups. So, you can't just look at pictures of brains or what's going on. You can't say to your clients that what you're experience is a normal response to an abnormal situation. Cuz the normal response statistically and otherwise is resilience. So, we have spent some time, ah, listening to the stories of people who are resilient especially returning soldiers, but also in the aftermath of Columbine, 9/l1 and the like. And I will give one plot cuz the answer to this is included in a book that I did call "Roadmap to Resilience" which is on sale here when we've looked at what characterizes resilience in six domains, ah, in terms of physical into personal, emotional, cognitive, behavior, and spiritual. It turns out that the major way that people cope in North America in response to trauma is to use some form of religion or spirituality. And that becomes really interesting. In fact, I'm gonna show a movie tomorrow what was gone on 9/11 and ask the audience, if these people were clients, how would you alter your treatment accordingly? That's the first point I wanna make. And then is we have a remarkable story to tell here. And the remarkable story is one of the remarkable courage and resilience. Second piece that I'd like to convey is I think we are all not only homo sapiens but we are homo narrans. We are all story-tellers, and we tell stories to ourselves and others. And I' m going to argue and maybe we get into this in terms of the probing that the nature what distinguishes a 75% from the 25% is the nature of the stories that people tell. And, in fact, you can go-- I put together these 357-page handout at this conference just in case you have nothing to do on the way home. Uhm, and you could actually go in there. And I have given you the algorithm of exactly what you need to do to have chronic PTSD. So god forbid something is happening to you that's traumatic, ah, and you seem to be making it, you can go to these pages and see how you could screw up your lives. Now, if there's any merit to that, it has a lot of implications that therapy is trying to get people to re-story their lives in developing coping skills that goes with it. Third point, and I conclude on this, is the field of psychotherapy in the area of trauma is filled with acronym therapies. You cannot do a therapy in the area of trauma unless you have an acronym. In fact, I'm convinced that people create the acronyms and then develop the therapies. So, what do you do? DTE, direct therapy. What do you do? CPD. Okay. What do you do? EMDR. Which finger do you use? It makes no difference. Okay. Okay. What do you do? Stress and acculturation threat. Now here is the kicker. No one acronym is better than any other acronym in differential accounts. And moreover, the commitment to evidence-based acronyms can make people worse. The field of interventions with trauma is absolutely filled with bullshit. And in five to 10% of the cases, it has the potential of making people worse. So, one of the thing that's really interesting is that if you look at the evidence-based programs that the VA, the IMO, and others are highlighting, they have highlighted anxiety-based interventions of exposure and the like. There is clearly a road for exposure when anxiety is dominant. But the field has now progressed. So, for many of the folks that we see, returning soldiers, victimized people, the dominant emotional response is guilt or shame or anger, or complicated grief, or moral injury. So the field has advanced that there are now evidence-based interventions that are tale to, to low specific emotional components. Trauma doesn't only affect an individual, it affects our family and it has community-based elements to it. So, therefore, the need for the therapist to involve significant others as part of the treatment is critical. A, it's a story of resilience and courage. B, we are all story-tellers, and the nature of the stories that we tell ourselves and others distinguishes the 75% versus the 25%. C, it's the quality nature of the relationship seven times more important than the specific technique you're going to use. So the specific technique is only gonna count for 15% of the outcome variance. You will find in your handout a chapter that I actually wrote on the critical role of therapeutic alliance in the treatment of trauma clients. I now look forward for the comments by my colleagues.

00:07:25
PETER LEVINE I think I like to, ah, tag along with some of your, uhm, salient points. Uhm, one is the importance of narratives. And I look at that in somewhat different perspective as a, a body psychotherapist. Uhm, I-- I'm thinking of a particular case, a particular woman that I worked with who was on the 81st floor of the World Trade Center when the planes hit it. And she has experienced, ah, by day absolutely flat affect would probably would call, ah, like Alexis Helmick(ph). Ah, she lost all her interests in life. But at night she would wake up sweating and in terror. When I first met Sharon, she started to tell the story about that day, about the horror of the trauma. But I noticed something interesting that her hands started to making a small movement like this. And that repeated two or three times. And when I brought her attention to it, she could feel something expansive in her body. And she connected that with the Hudson River, that the Hudson River is permanent, that the bombs, the planes could not destroy the river. And from that point, she was able to deal with some of these more positive resilient sensations. But that was in being able to get that body narrative. So, I, I think that's really an, ah, uhm, really important point you made. And, and also, when I was writing my book in In an Unspoken Voice, uhm, I would many times, ah, not know whether to zig or zag. And I disc-- I had discovered sometime, long time ago, ah, very wise book, the Chinese Book of Changes, the I Ching which goes back about 4,500 years. And the, the, ah, hexagram that I came, you throw coins or, ah, yarrow sticks was this one. "When a man has learned within his heart what fear and trembling mean, he is safeguarded against any terror produced by outside influences." And the, the first chapter I described a personal experience where I was, uhm, walking out in a balmy summer day and-- somewhere in California and I got hit by a car, and how I was thrown into the air and landed, ah, on the ground. And very fortunately, a woman came by and said, "I'm a doctor. Actually, I'm a pediatrician." And I think I thought, "Oh, that exactly a kind of doctor I do need at the moment." And she asked, "Is there's anything I can do for you?" And I said, "Yes. Please just stay here." And she got down on the ground and held my hand. And in that moment of feeling that connection, I was able to use the methods that I had developed over the last 40 years in body psychotherapy approach to, ah, to resolving traumatic or, ah, and other stress responses. So, again, that importance of having that other there present, present allowed me to go inside and to move through the trembling and the vibration and the waves of heat and cold that reset my nervous system. And, indeed, many of my friends have remarked afterwards how much more grounded and centered I seemed to be on a traumatic growth.

00:11:45
JACK KORNFIELD One of the retreats that I was leading included a group of young, uhm, inner city kids coming out of gangs and also some vets coming back from Iraq. Uh-hmm, and the kids, the young ones, uhm, when they come in and they say, "Well, we're gonna do these practices together of mindfulness or story-telling or myth or, or, or, ah, collective, uhm, martial arts and so forth, poetry. They sit in the back but their hoods up, they turned their heads and it's like, "Come on. I'm out on the streets in the middle this undeclared war and you're gonna give me this stuff?" So, we do something very simple sometimes. Just took a table like this and light a candle in the middle and say, uhm, "We can't begin cuz there are too many people here, uhm, who haven't been acknowledge even though you can't see them. So, can you go out in the parking lot and pick up a stone for every young person you know who's been killed. And just place the stone on the table and say their name." And some of these kids will come back with their hands full of stones. No young person should know that many dead people and say this is for tito and this is for Arjay(ph) and this is for home girl, and this is-- and just started naming of. In the minute that, that very, very simple ritual is done, they realized that this is a place that can hold their tears, and their grief, and their sorrow, and their story, and their truth. So, as you've just heard from Donald and Peter, the, the human connection, the capacity for story to be revealed in a place that feels both safe, uhm, and in the arms of community, makes an enormous difference. It's not just a personal question in trauma. It's personal and interpersonal and universal. So, a few more things to add. As a teacher of meditation and mindfulness, and as you know, mindfulness industries have been growing at great deal in the last decades, lots of studies, and, and so forth, one of the things that is important to understand is the spiritual bypass that in certain groups and populations, people will take up spiritual practice and it can be a source of great resilience and, and enormous help. But equally so, uhm, it's used to bypass, uhm, the actual experience, or when people come to do a training in mindfulness or meditation, they'll sit and they can't do it. And they say, "Well, that's the wrong intervention." The reason they can do it usually is because of trauma and they're unable to see it. I had a woman to try to sit and couldn't got it. And I immediately, more than anything, get curious what's going on. And I had to close her eyes and see whether she could hardly stay in her skin. I said, "Well, few months going on your body as Peter is saying, see her shaking, feel the shaking and all of a sudden, she said, "Ropes." And it turned out she'd been abducted 15 years before and kidnapped and all these traumatic things had happened to her. In a minute, she sat down. As we do, as we get quiet, the unfinished business of the heart begins to reveal itself. Uhm, so I didn't have her see it. I had a walk. She actually-- she came to be at 10-day withdrew with me. She walked 10 days back and forth and in this contemplative way with a practice of compassion and all kinds of other things we did. But, basically, she walked herself back into her body. So you need to understand the, uhm,-- there's a community dimension. My friend, Anne Lamott puts it this way. She said, "My mind is like a bad neighborhood. I tried not to go there, ah, but-- my mind is like a bad neighborhood"-- what does she said? I lost my thread. I'll get it. Uhm, "My mind is like a bad neighborhood. I try not to go there alone." Okay. So that's the-- so, you have others there, uhm, you understand that if, that if someone can't be present, you get curious and you begin to track in these different dimensions, the map of what's going with the body, what are the emotions, what is the story that needs to be telled-- told, and maybe that you are maybe in company that's was-- will say-- especially if you get combat fits together. I can't tell you what I saw. And there's this pause. I can't tell you what I did. And that has the complexity of the grief, of the shame, and the guilt, and you know, a guy stands up and he says, "This person-- you know, I'm in Iraq and everybody could be a suicide bomber. I'm trying to stop the people coming to my post and I say, "Stop, stop, stop in Arabic," and this one guy keeps coming. This old man, he keeps coming and finally I shoot him up. And everyone starts weeping and then this translator runs in and he says-- I said, "What are they saying?" "Don't you know the old man was deaf?" And he stands there - 

00:17:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I know that is true. 

00:17:05
JACK KORNFIELD - and he just weep." And the gang kids were there come and hold him. And said, "Yeah, we know. We understand." Uhm, and somehow, the release of-- the telling of the story, the allowing for emotions, the respect for what's going on in the body, and the tracking of it as Peter has worked this so beautifully, uhm, and then the deepest peace which Donald speaks of is trust that when people come in and you see not their pathology. Uhm, but in the Buddhist tradition that's called their original dignity or their nobility. "Oh, nobly born, I see who you really are. You're not this trauma. You're not his difficulty. Who you are is so much greater than that." And when you can look someone in the eyes and see that, and say, "This is workable. We know how to do this." Uhm, there are ways to release this from the body. There's stories to tell their emotions. And when they understand and bond with your understanding that that's not who they are, then the healing that's necessary can take place. 

00:18:15
MARY PIPHER Thank you. I'm really glad you're doing that work Jack. That's really important work. And also both of you, the work that you're doing. It's an honor to be on this, uhm, stage with these three and it's a little bit humbling. I can resure-- reassure you, Don, there's no acronym or initials for what I do. 

00:18:40
JACK KORNFIELD Hmm. 

00:18:40
MARY PIPHER I just don't have anything that fancy to share. But, anyway, I am-- my ideas about trauma, ah, I'd been working on with my whole life. I mean there's a little girl I figured out that when I was upset, if I read a book or if I went outside, or played with an animal, I'd calm down. And that was very useful and helpful for me. As a therapist-- uhm, I don't know if I read this or I just through trial and error figured this out, but when I dealt with trauma victims-- and at that time, a lot of the trauma victims that I worked with were sexual assault victims. Ah, college student who'd been raped and so on. Ah, but other ki-- domestic violence victims, uhm, people who'd been in an accident or responsible for an accident, that kind of thing, I found out that the, the, the two questions that move them forward, the most quickly through their, their trauma and toward recovery were-- given the circumstances you were in, what in retrospect can you be proud of? Given the small choices you had in a situation where you had so little control, what small or large choices were you able to make that you can now look on with pride? So, that was a kind of a shifting question toward honor instead of shame. And then the other question which always elicit it, a resilient response was whether do you learned from this experience. No experience no matter how terrible is without redemptive value once you struggle to answer that question. So, those were two things from that. When I worked with the refugees who by definition have all suffered terribly, what I figured out worked best with them was just, uhm,-- this isn't my idea, this came from PTSD work, international PTSD work at Harvard. But they talked about what they called a healing package where you sit down with somebody who's traumatized and, and probably still traumatize. They're poor. They're in a, a new country struggling down your standard language. They can't figure out how to get a car or health care and so on. And you say, "What is it that you need to heal from the experiences that you had?" And then you listen to him and try to help him get those things. So, a lot of times with the refugees, I went from being a therapist in the traditional sense of the word, to being more of a case manager. Because people would say things like, "You know, my, my grandfather died in front of me and we've never buried him. Do you know any place we could have a service for my grandfather?" Or, they'd say, "I wanna know a place I can take my children for a picnic." Or, "I would like to be able to go swimming." Or, "I need to help getting a car." And those would be-- I mean, they're very practical things about the relationship issues involved and actually attending what people ask, ask for and say their need. Another very good question, and this could be true with work with military or, or inner city gang kids or whatever it is, i n your community, how do people heal? How do people get better in your community? Because of course, with refugees how do I know how ku-- Kurdish people heal or even what the word heal means to them. So, that's what I would use. And then, in my last book, "The Green Boat" which is what my keynotes about tomorrow, I, I thought about a lot, uhm, how do all of us heal from the, the sort of global anguish we have over the possible faith of our planet and our culture. You know, we live in such a hard time and I think at some level, we're all really struggling to figure out how to be vibrant and happy and yet honest and, uhm, aware. And, uhm, the three-- what I, what I came up with is what I call in the book a "transcendent response." And it's basically a very simple idea which is we cannot solve the problems we're experiencing when they become insolvable without growing. And, uhm, the Jaws stories that get example of that were the, the sheriff and his men were out looking for the shark and they see it. And afterwards, the sheriff goes, "We're gonna need to get a bigger boat." It's that response of "I need a bigger boat." That's a transcendent response. And, and there's a 100 transcendent responses. Uhm, but the three I got really interested in writing this last book. And I, I don't probably have time to elaborate too much now, I will tomorrow. Our first of all action and the number of people who've been traumatized and they decide to devote their lives to you helping other people who were in pain is extraordinary. You know, we have a woman and, uhm, a couple in Lincoln who's daughter, uhm, died of, uhm, alcohol toxemia. You know, she just drank so much at a party at college. She died. And, and they just both quit their jobs and, and started to devoting their lives to alcohol education for college students. This is a very common response. Another thing I think is very good is, uhm, connecting more deeply with that which is meaningful and that can be, uhm, connecting to the natural world, that can be connecting to family, that can be connecting to community or to your spiritual life, but a, a movement forward into that which is the most meaningful. And, and then the final one is again something I, I can't elaborate on too much right now, but it's, it's really a growth in moral imagination. Uhm, and one of the, the f-- one of the benefits I think of having been a sufferer, of having been in great pain which I think almost everyone in this room could say that about their lives. Is it, is it gives you ideally a larger sense of understanding and empathy for other people who've been in pain? And that's what I called the growth of the moral imagination. And at least for me, uhm, and for many of the people I've worked with framing things in terms of that kind of growth toward kindness and empathy and so on. It is really beautiful way to work with trauma. So... 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Ah, can, can I just some observations on what Mary just said? Uhm, from my point of view, your most valuable tool as the commission is the art of questioning. And one of the things to notice about Mary is that everyone in the four questions she asked was a what and how question. So, she asked what choices did you have. What did you learn? How do people in your community respond? What and how questions are very powerful and effective. Why questions are not productive. Secondly, one of the things that's interesting is that when she asked what choices you have that is totally consistent with Kubani's work on guilt-related kinds of treatment that people have. So, he has studied people who were stuck in the 25% group who have hindsight bias and engaging counterfactual thinking asking why questions in a Job-like character for which there are no satisfactory answers. So, Mary is a gifted and wise clinician. Okay. And even though she has not attended my workshop nor read Roadmap to Resilience, okay, if you listen to her instinctive clinical connections with clients, she is able to incorporate a good deal of literature on the role of guilt or shame. And she's able by means of the thoughtfulness of questions and by the presence of her personality and sense of caring and compassion, that she is able to help people transform their story to make it a gift to give to others. She is able to highlight positive emotions like empathy and compassion that have nuerobiolo-- neurobiological sequela line in this domain. So without knowing all of the underlying research, her understanding of people transforms itself into something that we would all benefit from. So, it's, it's really-- it's-- I, I supervised a lot of people, so I'm absolutely an exquisite listener to the language that they use, okay, and, ah, we should all listen to Mary as often as humanly possible. 

00:29:30
MARY PIPHER I had a friend asking (inaudible ). 

00:29:35
JACK KORNFIELD Yeah, do you wanna acquire. I, I have a question for you Peter that I've, that I've wanted to ask, uhm, because your work is so somatically based, and with a very deep intelligence of how the fight, flight, or freeze for, ah, for the nervous system will, uhm, hold trauma in the body and then, ah, detailed ways of resourcing people, and-- so that they have some basis of well-being and then releasing it from the body. We're also talking as you did about story, about social context, about the communion between the healer and the person who's been traumatized, about the depth of listening in questions, uhm, you focused so much on your work on the body. Is that enough? Uhm, can it be done without the body by telling story? How do you, how do they fit together for you? 

00:30:30
PETER LEVINE Well, I mean, I think they all do fit together and it's the art of how to fit them together. Ah, for example, I was really, really taken by your, ah, book on, uhm, ah, PTSD. The, the maps, the mind maps, the traps really outlined in an exquisite way. And I found myself, "Oh, my gosh! I, I, I-- I'll do that. This is-- yeah." And, of course, my interest is also whereas primarily-- or from the bottom up. And to get to your question, I'm thinking about Ray. He's a, ah, a, ah, a survivor of, ah, Iraq and Afghanistan, and he was going up by IEDs. And when he comes into the room, you see him like this, really very much like this shell shock soldiers of, of World War I. Ah, his body from my perspective, because he was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, PTSD, chronic pain, and Tourette syndrome and it's not something that usually appears out of a blue. But I could see that these were incomplete responses. This is what his body was doing to attempt to defend himself to survive in that blast. I mean, there are many, many other things going on as well. But be-- by being able to start there to untangle that web of what the body does, because when the body does something like this and it get stuck. Ah, I remember also seeing, ah, ah, pictures of the-- during the Bosnian War of these old women trying to cross the road and they would get across the road. Halfway across the road and a bomb would go off and their shoulder would come up. And then they would scary back and they would try to cross again and another bomb and their both, ah, shoulders went up to their ears. The third time they went up and they stayed up. So the body is signaling to the mind, to the brain, to the primitive portions of the brain and the brainstem, the extrapyramidal system that their threat still exist because the body keep telling it. Until the body can tell a story which contradicts that, which gives an alternative narrative, then that pattern keeps repeating itself. But in starting with this, then he was able to engage in a group-- I can say, I'll probably show some of that in the sessions, in the, in the workshop I'll do tomorrow, he was able to move through the shock to deal with his profound human emotions of guilt and sorrow, rage, and guilt, and sorrow in a safe contained way. And that's the key. It has to be safe, it has to be contained, and it's best felt in a, in a community of other people. 

00:33:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Can I... 

00:33:35
PETER LEVINE Please. 

00:33:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM How did you get this soldier to get on stuck? Okay. So, he has all these physical manifestations that are concomitant to illnesses or due to the exposure to the trauma. So, help me understand, uhm, cuz I, I don't know it work in the same way. So, I'm kind of curious as to how you would then intercede to help this soldier. 

00:34:00
PETER LEVINE Okay. This is probably gonna probably seem really strange to you. And if you like by the way, I can give you-- I give you a, a copy of the video. No, no. I'm gonna-- what I could see when he starts to talk and he goes it to this convulsive-like movements, what I noticed is that the first thing that happens is there a tightening in his jaw. His jaw clenches. Again, that's what you would be doing if a bomb exploded. So, I said to him, I said, "Ray, this is gonna seem really strange. But what I'm gonna ask you to do is join me in a little exercise." And then I show him with my jaw, "I want you just to allow your jaw to open just a little bit just to where you feel the resistance. And let it close and let it open again." And we did this three or four time. And of all a sudden, reported tingling all over his body and a feeling of warmth and flow. This was a very small thing that I got from my observation of what, what was going on in his body. And then he was able to become mindful of that and released that tension and released that whole chain of sequelae. So, uhm, yeah. 

00:35:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Thank you. 

00:35:15
PETER LEVINE Ah, you're welcome. 

00:35:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So, now we can take a few questions. So, if you'll come up to the microphone please and speak loudly. Uhm, yes. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN I thank you very much for that. Ah, when there's been a trauma, it would be lovely to have someone next to you to hold your hand every time. If one has a therapist with who-- whom one has a close alliance, how marvelous. But how about individuals who experienced trauma, who even temporarily do not have someone to hold their hand and don't have a therapeutic alliance nor a, a therapist? Ah, Don, ah, morning. Alert, alert. I know you have analogy that acronyms but here comes one. Because I feel in addition to the, the enriching importance of having empathy and compassion for others and, and nicking action. Uhm, the tool of Albert Ellis, here we go, REBT, give someone a substantial ability in moments there isn't a kind soul around to remind themselves that they can stand what they don't like. That they can reach out... 

00:36:50
MARY PIPHER Can you just-- can you give us the question? 

00:36:50
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So what is the question, please. 

00:36:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yes, give us the question. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, could you comment on the importance of education - 

00:36:55
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN - and prevention and the benefit of tools that maybe come from acronyms. Thank you. 

00:37:00
PETER LEVINE Thank you. Ah, let me give you just a, a quick answer which I see as critical in, in therapy and also I hope address the part of your question. And this is, I think one of the-- very often, our clients see-- come to see us and they're in a harmful situation. Ah, they're lives are falling apart. They've overwhelmed by, by feelings and sensations that they have no control over. But they come in and were empathic-- empathetic and they feel like somebody's listening to them. Somebody is holding their hands and they start to let go. However, once they leave, and these sensations and these feelings come back with a vengeance, they often feel even worse and more shame because they're unable to do this for themselves. I think one of the most important things that I can do as a therapist is teach people with tools that they can use on their own. And you'll see Ray when he, he talks about it, he said for, "When I first saw this guy, I thought it was the biggest crack of, you know, what. But what I realized that I could use these tools for myself. And when I felt myself getting over-stimulated or shutting down, I could use the tools." So, I think it's critical that as soon as possible that we are able to give clients tools that they can use all the time and that they're not wholly dependent on the therapist. I hope that gives you some answer. 

00:38:40
JACK KORNFIELD And, and I'd like to add something. I was just here for the previous panel and very moved by what Donald and Mary had to say of all the science and the understanding of what makes for social and emotional health in children and adolescents, uhm, and see it really is, ah, as a public policy problem. We have to change the values of our society. Uhm, but the point is that teaching social and emotional learning to children gives them tools for resilience. Teaching-- there's a program now for the Marines called M-Fit, uhm, which is being spread across the Marine Corps and its pre-deployment. And it's taking these young men and occasionally young women, 18, 19 years old saying you're gonna be put in an extremely situations. Here are ways to regulate yourself using trainings of awareness or mindfulness or cognitive understanding, ways both to calm, ways to center yourself, and the-- this-- the initial studies of it show enormous, ah, decreases in traumatic-- uhm, post-traumatic disorders because they have these regulatory tools. 

00:39:45
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:39:45
JACK KORNFIELD So, this-- we're now at a point, at a tipping point, if we're lucky, where the society is beginning to realize that these are the trainings we need to give our children, and in some way, need to build into the way we educate ourselves. 

00:40:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. The only thing I would add to this is I, I think that an effective intervention of a trauma client is based on the quality and the nature of therapeutic alliance. What's insufficient has changed the behavior. So, that psychoeducation is really an important element. It's not like just using psychoeducation giving a mini lecture. The art of questioning, case conceptualization, ah, I, I use a lot of metaphors and analogy, story-telling, ah, teaching skills in building in generalization, during collaborative goal setting. So, I am in the business of training mental health workers to work with returning soldiers. And therefore, we identified the variety of core, ah, therapy skills that, ah, should be addressed, uhm, and how this could be tailored to specific presenting problems. So, I think your observation about the role of psychoeducation, these other components are really important. The goal is to turn the client into their own therapists as my colleagues has been noting. And I increase the likelihood that they'll use this in appropriate occasions. And I can go on and on in, in terms of the specifics they're in. Can I make one request? Cuz we like to accommodate as many people as possible. If you have a question, start off with the question. Okay? Don't give us a case study cuz as Mary indicated, it all depends. So just come up with your question and let's see how many people we can get through in the next 10 minutes. 

00:41:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Okay so, your question please? 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN I have a question about working with families and, and active duty military cuz I provide home, home visits for-- on an Air Force base with families, uhm, who have active duty coming home. 

00:41:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So what is your question? 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Well, do you have any, any thoughts about working with families, children, mothers of active duty military? 

00:41:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Read Munson's work on working with families and how do we engage the family and significant others as collaborated in doing exposure-based interventions. There are numerable programs out there from everything from yellow ribbon to others. There are Sesame Street programs for kids and there's a whole program-- I mean, you can go to the some of the stuff we've written on them. Listen to on how to help families who are going to deal with returning service members, who are amputees in physical. So, there's a lot of resources out there specially for that population, ah, that I would encourage you to look at. 

00:42:30
PETER LEVINE Also, ah, right about trauma proofing your kids using again the body, ah, based ideas of how-- if they help children let these things move through their bodies and come back into their own resilience, their own joy, confidence. 

00:42:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS And we'll take a question over here. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN Sometimes I get the sense that clients are moving into healing states, ah, many times in the session and moving out of them, and, ah, don't recognize that they're actually standing in a threshold. And I wonder if one of you might or, or a few of you might conta-- ah, contact that question? 

00:43:10
MARY PIPHER I might just say that something small about that which is as a therapist, I always really tried just like as a mother catching children being good, I tried to catch clients being strong. So, for example, if someone who had been, uhm, very depressed, never a happy statement maybe even the smallest copied statement, I do a lot of things about that statement. Like, for example, just say they came in and said, "It's, it's pretty outside today. It's nice spring morning." But that for them was extraordinary unusual behavior. I might say something like, "What did you say?" and have him say it again. And then I might even say, "I wonder if you notice you said that." And then, I might even say, "And I wonder if you realize the significance of that." And, and then I might say, "In all the time I've known you, I've never heard you say something so cheerful and positive." And then, it might be the things to help them believe in their growth. Uhm, and I think I would feel the same way a little about when you're discussing that if, if I working with someone who, who had a, a very sadness and viewed, ah, weakness and viewed story of their trauma-- ah, when I, when I had a chance, when there was even one small line, I could draw from there their, their story and say, "Tell me that again. Do you realize what's this means about your moving into a new story for yourself?" That way, if you have that moment of turning and the client isn't, uhm, strong enough or aware enough yet to see it, you've done everything you can to make sure it is underlined and, and framed as significant. 

00:45:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I would just add one other thing and I, I get this kind of question all the time. I have a metaphor which is go public with the data. So, it's not that hard. All you have to do is say to client, "I noticed something. I wonder if you notice it, too." So what you're gonna do is extend an invitation of engaging a metacognitive frontal lobe of activity of noticing. And you, in a non-judgmental fashion, go public with the data which suggest that they're in or out, okay? And then, what happen is you're going to try and encourage them to notice this on their own once they're out there. And then you're into what Mary said of what are the implications of this in terms of what these meanings-- the other thing that's really powerful is for you to be surprised as a therapist - 

00:46:30
JACK KORNFIELD Okay. 

00:46:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - you know, to convey. You just said, "What? Ho-- hold on. I mean, did I pick that up directly? Am I in tune with-- I mean, this is Columbo-like. You know, and, and, you know, you know, what the best thing I would suggest is play dumb, it won't be that hard." 

00:46:50
PETER LEVINE I'm gonna add one more thing about observing change the question again was this healing or now moments as, ah, Daniel's theorem called them. And that is as we train ourselves be-- and really it doesn't take all that much because we are wired to resonate with people's facial expressions with their postures, their micro expressions as Paul Ekman has done incredible research on, but even more powerfully these minute changes in posture and breathing. And when you perceive that sense of relief and can feedback back to the client, maybe even just with something so minor, "Ah, ah-huh. Okay. I'm wondering what you're noticing right now." "Oh, I feel more open in my chest. "Okay. That's great. Is there anything else that you're noticing right now?" And again, I think one of the themes we have all talked about is this questioning, this being open to this miracle that we see in our clients movement towards wholeness. 

00:48:05
JACK KORNFIELD And the tuning to, again, the theme, the tuning to what turns them toward healing-- uhm, I worked for many years with, ah, Maha Ghosananda who's the Gandhi of Cambodia, and his whole family was murdered and yet he let peace walk through the killing fields doing chance of love and kindness, taking people back to their villages. Uhm, and when he work individually with people, he would ask them at the right moment what it is that they loved. Whatever it was. What it is-- ah, what they remembered that they love. Well, and it didn't matter. It could have been their dog, you know. It didn't have to be some grand thing or could have been that, you know, corner of their garden. And he would evoke as a kind of resourcing to use your word, Peter, he would evoke in them or find that seed, uhm, that would, that would allow that sense-- sensibility of, of love and the heart of capacity to grow. And then say, "Let's"-- in himself or training, "let's build on that. Let's look for those seeds, whatever it is, and it will grow from there." 

00:49:20
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Wonderful. Question over here, please? 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Brief question. So, there are two things. There's post-traumatic symptoms, and then there's post-traumatic growth. Ah, a lot of what you speak about is about ego strengthening, post-traumatic growth, etcetera. The symptoms, ah, re--resolution of the symptoms does not necessarily mean the people grow and also, uhm, people growing does not necessarily mean symptoms decrease. Uhm, and there's more, uhm, evidence- based treatments of symptoms than, than growth. So, my question is, uhm, how do you strike the bells between supporting a person's growth versus, ah, focusing on PTSD symptoms and decreasing symptoms? 

00:50:00
JACK KORNFIELD Yes. 

00:50:00
MARY PIPHER Is that you. 

00:50:05
JACK KORNFIELD That's the answer. Yes. Go ahead, please. 

00:50:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Well, one of the things that you keep in mind is that you could be resilient and have post-traumatic stress at the same time. It's not mutually incompatible events. And people can be resilient in one area and not in other areas. I am, ah, very responsive as a therapist to the impact of symptoms. So, for example, one of the major things you would always ask about these clients has to do with sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is gonna send them off all kinds of difficulties during the day. So, I'm interested and we're probing this in a systematic way with regard to insomnia, nightmares, difficulty falling asleep and the like. The second kind of this you has to do with the avoidance behavior either avoidance behavior or thinking about ones behavior reminders. Another symptom is hypervigilance. One of the major things that's emerging in returning soldiers is the high incidents of automobile accidents given that they are stuck using what were coping strategies over there. Ah, another aspect has to do with associations. So, there are now a number of cognitive behavioral interventions that prove the fact to reduce the nature of symptomatology. The other kind of thing has to do with high core morbidity. Ah, with the people I see, there is remarkable high instance of suicidality. All the cases I show and the one I'm gonna tomorrow are people who attempted suicide as a way of trying to escape from self or using substances. So I think that, ah, there is a need for , ah, therapists to address him to mythology or, ah, therapists who address him to mythology and not only focusing on the rest of the story and the strengths, you know, on redeeming features of what they did to survive. Ah, that will come. But if you cannot use reduce the symptomatology right at the, the back, that's gonna interfere with all kinds of functioning. Last point that I wanna make is that there are number of interventions that are effective to reduce symptomatology. Ah, VA and others have done a number of studies of psychotropic medications that are pretty good at reducing positive symptoms, not so good on negative symptoms of anhedonia and the like. One of the things that happens is that this not result in the improvement in the quality of life that these people have. That's their relationships, their ability to go back to work to engage in leisure activity to find meaning in their lives. So you need to have that kind of intervention that addresses those kinds of features as well as symptomatology. Fortunately, the field has now emerged into what is called integrative therapies. As you go to the work of Najavits or Kocher or Freud, or other people I reviewed that have now treated comorbid disorders. Like, why do substance abused have PTSD go hand in hand? And today is indicating that those kinds of integrated treatments are more effective than parallel or sequential treatments. So, uhm, I, I think your question is really an important one and it sets its agenda for the therapists. Do not do any of this without the input and collaboration of the client. You need them to understand what you're doing and why. Do not become a surrogate frontal lobe and say, "I have manual for your treatment." Okay. The person needs to understand, participate, and be engaged in that process. Without that, no matter how you have these techniques, they're not gonna work. 

00:53:30
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Thank you. Okay. We have time for one last question, and you are the lucky person. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN Sure. I'm finding a major sticking point is-- for soldiers returning back as working with their tremendous guilt. It comes about and I'd like to hear your various experiences working with, ah, with tremendous guilt that soldiers feel when they return back. 

00:53:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Ah, yeah, we, we worked with soldiers who have shot bodies in friendly fire, ah, of people who have engaged in atrocities, ah, ah, people who have inadvertently performed acts, you know, the-- you know, people driving drones or driving them from, ah, Texas and other places. And they, you know, they drop them and then they get correlates of, ah, of the fact that, that when the drome went that's actually wiped out a whole school and then these guys have to go and pick up their kids from their own school. So, ah, ah, the, the person who I would, ah, recommend is Gaynor and Kubany, K-U-B-A-N-Y. And he has developed a, ah, first of all a self-assessment skill for guilt, ah, ah, given that and, ah, reviewing that with the client, acknowledging the sense of guilt, ah, of saying to the client she has given what you've experienced. If that time you're not feeling guilty, I would think we'd be in big, big trouble. So, what you're going to do is acknowledge that. Then what happens is he has , ah, addresses the fact that people who were guilty now have information that they did not have at beforehand. This goes back to Mary's question about choices. You know, so they now are res-- having knowledge that the correlates were at school as compared to, and they feel guilty about that. They are now on number of cognitive restructuring procedures if, you know-- we can go through that detail in order to get them restore and re-frame their lives. The, the next kind of element is-- this goes back to the prior question-- is to how can people create a life that's worth living. I tell a case-- I gave a case the other day of a mother who actually blew out the brains of her daugher. She was trying to protect her. The daughter came in and she opened the door. This woman killed her child. She was now suicidal. And, ah, one of the things we did for her, I just in, in bullet point, highlighted, was we asked her what did she see special in the daughter. What made the relationship special? And then what we did was to have her bring in for a picture album of her, of her daughter which was very painful to look at. We asked the, uhm,-- we, we contextualize this hot spot of the traumatic event by retrieving some of the positive memories. 

00:56:15
PETER LEVINE I know. 

00:56:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM The date of Bruen and others highlight that we don't get rid of bad thoughts. What do you is take the landmark event, ah, list its guilt and you put it into coherent narrative. So, then what we did was we had the imaginary child appear. If you look at prolonged complicated grief, there's a lot of Gestalt Empty Chair kinds of things. We had the child come in. We invited the child and we asked the child what advice, if any, would she have for the mother. 

00:56:45
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:56:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And then the mother as the key element, I apropos what Mary said, had to make a gift of her experience. And what she did was to now transform her pain into educating parents about the dangers of keeping guns in the house. 

00:57:00
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:57:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So you had to develop the therapeutic alliance. You had to find out and hear the nature of laws. Your humanity had to reach out to the person. Okay. You had to contextualize the pain either in terms of hindsight bias or you have to get them to, ah, address and contextualize that in terms of logic coherent. And the, finally, you need to have to transform her pain into a gift that she could give to others - 

00:57:20
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - that she define meaning in that apropos the fractal reference. I mean, so you know, there's a lot that - 

00:57:25
PETER LEVINE Sure. 

00:57:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - goes on here and this is gonna take an impact on new therapists as you listen to the story. And therefore, you need to recognize that your job is to develop vicarious resilience not just burn out and listen to these folks. 

00:57:40
PETER LEVINE I'm just gonna add o-- sorry. I'm gonna add one thing to that and-- because when this has come up and, ah, the soldier has confessed - 

00:57:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

00:57:50
PETER LEVINE - and said, "What can you do to help me?" I think really asking for absolu-- of solution. And the response I sometimes find is the mo-- certainly the most authentic for me is I can give you an answer but what I can do is help you tap into some of your deep inner strengths - 

00:58:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Uh-hmm. 

00:58:10
PETER LEVINE - as we work together. 

00:58:15
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So, thank you everyone and thank you - 

00:58:15
JACK KORNFIELD Thank you. 

00:58:15
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS - panel. Wonderful. 

00:58:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Stay nice. 

00:58:15
PETER LEVINE Thank you. I'll give you a book.
