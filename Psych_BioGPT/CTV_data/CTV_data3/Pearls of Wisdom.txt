Introduction Marie L. Miville, Ph.D. Winter Roundtable Director 

00:00:00
DR. MARIE MIVILLE Well, we are back for day two and the excitement continues. Well, you know, running a conference it’s, uh, just a little bit hard for us to experience exactly what we hope for all of you to experience; uh, all the different little details we're tra-, trying to track. And I've really appreciated those of you, uh, both the senior folks and the students who've come up to me and to the other staff, and just have shared with us what has felt meaningful, what has felt important to you. And one of the things that has absolutely struck home is the most common thing I hear, and I've heard this about the Roundtable ever since I've been associated with it, is that the sessions, when you're in them, you find yourself allowing yourself, they engage you; you are able to become involved in the deep, emotional work, uh, at least for that time of the session of what it takes to become involved in social justice advocacy work. And so, it, it really just makes my heart sing to, to know that with day one, that is something that we were able to achieve, uh, here and a lot of it has to do with you and your willingness to, to open up yourselves. And so, this morning’s session is all about that too. And it's the chance for our leaders to come together and talk story with all of you, to share some of their thoughts and feelings about the work that they’ve done in fighting the multiple social, uh, justice battlefronts that we fight daily. And what a panel we have, um, and before I get to that, I want to acknowledge, of course, our first panelists. Uh, this was started by our own Dr. Derald Sue four years ago, he's here and Thomas Parham was on that, Eduardo Morales, Nancy Boyd-Franklin, all of those folks have been here again today. So, it's, it's just great to see us continue with our traditions. So, the panel we have this year for our 30th is really an amazing and very special group of people and I just want to take two, just a few minutes, cause we could be here all morning talking about their accomplishments, but that's not what we're here to do, but just a few words about each of them. We have Patricia Arredondo. She is the first Latina president of American Counseling Association. So, that's right, this weekend we have seen two Latinas who have stepped up to take major leadership roles in our field. And Patricia is here with us today. She's also the developer, along with others, of the multicultural competencies and guidelines that APA past after many, many years of efforts. And I have to say, she's also the individual who brought together many of us Latino psychologists and brought life back to the National Latino Psychology Association. So, thank you, Patricia. Welcome. We also have Janet Helms who, she is the person, you’ve probably heard her name a lot in just the last 24 hours, uh, and, and most likely before that. Uh, she's the person whose name bears the mentoring award we've given each year for the last 23 years. She, of course, is a major leader and proponent of racial identity research and her ideas continue to influence this Roundtable, as they have every year. And, of course, she was my own mentor in graduate school and so, I could speak for two hours about her influence on, on me as a person and as a professional because she's had that, kind of, dual influence. Michelle Fine, the innovator of, uh, Participatory Action Research, and what is very special about Michelle’s work is that she gives voice to those of us who typically are voiceless in research in the social sciences and psychology. Uh, you know, uh, when I started in psychology, we used to call people that were involved in research ‘subjects’ and now, of course, they’ve moved to be called ‘ participants’. And, uh, folks like Michelle are, are, have been actually central to moving the participant as the center of what our research needs to be. Thomas Parham, who I call counseling psychologists own great orator and longtime friend and supporter of the Roundtable. He has mentored generations of mental health professionals and, as we saw last night, as he paid tribute to his dear friend and colleague, someone with grace who humbly also can pay tribute to others. We welcome Thomas back again. And Rockey Robbins, another of our great orators, whose work with American Indian families has rocked the indigenous world. Rockey’s been a great friend and mentor to me, especially when I was a lone Latina living in Oklahoma and he was just, um, he's a doll and, and he's a great leader. Um, he's someone who is able to, like all of these individuals, he brings us all together in the room and we feel it right in the moment. And, of course, our wonderful, uh, facilitator, Dr. Alvin Alvarez, because what is amazing about the individuals I've just introduce is not only the incredible work and leadership they have done themselves, but the things that they had passed on to their own students and the leaders of today, and that does bring me to our facilitator Dr. Alvin Alvarez. Um, he is also one of Janet Helms’ mentees and he won our mentoring award last year. He gave an amazing talk last year, absolutely amazing. It's now available on Microtraining and for the students in our class, I will put it on our website, so no worries there. Um, he, he talked about the challenges of social justice advocacy work, particularly, uh, issues of race; as that as being akin to pulling a tiger’s tail. That is, when you take, dare to take on the dominant powers that be, well, you better be ready for what the tiger will do when his tail is pulled. And it was actually Janet who affirmed for Alvin, not only the importance of doing so, but the joys and triumphs of that. Pulling the tiger’s tail is a rallying cry to all of us to engage in difficult dialogues and take actions toward policy changes. So, don't be afraid to take it on or, in Nancy's words from yesterday, work through your own fears to do it. And so now I'd like to ask, uh, Dr. Alvarez, just to pass it on to him. Thank you. 

00:08:00
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Okay. First of all, this being the 30th anniversary, this is a birthday celebration. So, like any other celebration, can we just give a big round of applause to Marie for carrying this forward? 

00:08:15
[sil.] 

00:08:15
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Wonderful. Now, one of the things you're gonna know, just from the bios that you’ve heard about these folks, is that these folks who are gonna take charge. In fact, they started taking charge even before they got here on the podium. So, uh, they, I guess, Marie, this was somewhat called like an elders plenary or something like that? But we, we, they, they took it a little bit of, uh, they weren't so hot on that. So, we're, so, we're gonna re-change the title of this show. And I think Michelle had actually provided a wonderful suggestion that I want to share with folks. So, this is gonna be a panel of hot and, what did you say? 

00:08:50
DR. MICHELLE FINE Hot and sexy panelists. 

00:08:50
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ There you go. Hot and sexy psychologists. So, all right. So, so, so, in case you don’t like the product of it, why don’t we give this panel of hot and sexy psychologists a round of applause on the front end of things, all right? 

00:09:15
[sil.] 

00:09:15
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ I bet you don’t see that in your lecture notes a lot. All right, so, you know, uh, I want to thank Marie cause, uh, you know, uh, for me, this is also a coming home process for me. Uh, you know, I went to the University of Maryland and this was actually the place where I gave my very first professional presentation, and I was nervous, I was scared; and I remember Janet and Donny Cook, uh, saying, no, that’s okay, you'll, you'll be all right. This is a good group of people. These are people who are gonna sit and want to hear what you have to say. But, but, that being said, it, it was nerve-raking and I remember, you know, driving up here and we were in a car and two, two of my colleagues, uh, from grad school were with me; one person, uh, was from Ohio, another person was from, uh, New York and then there was me. The person from New York was from Queens and so, we figured who’s gonna drive up here, right? So, New York guy, right? And, uh, so we were driving up here, we were, kind of, going over our notes and thinking about how we were gonna do this presentation, pretty nervous about it and then, at some point in the drive, I fell asleep. And, shows you how much I cared about the presentation, uh, but, but, at some point I woke up and I looked up and, next thing I know, I saw this big sign and it said ‘Exit to Independence Hall.’ I'm thinking, I'm from California, but I'm pretty damn sure Independence Hall ain't anywhere near New York. And, next thing I know, we're seeing signs for Philly. And I turned around to my friend and I said, ‘ Ralph, what, why, why are we at Philly?’ And he said, ‘I don’t know, are we in Philly?’ I was like, ‘You're the one that’s from New York, you're the one who's supposed be able to drive!’ He goes, and this is, first thing I learned about New Yorkers, he turned to me and goes, ‘New Yorkers don’t know how to drive. We don’t know what the hell’s going on.’ Anyway, we made it up here, all right, and we did our presentation, but, but the point of that story is, you know, I talk about this place as coming home, but, but home isn't just a place, right? It’s not. Home is about people. Home is about relationships. Home is about the connections you make in this room, and in the hallways, and over, you know, breaking bread over your receptions. And, for me, the best part of coming home and going home, or places that I call home, is the conversations; is the times we have to talk, the times we have to be able to be real with each other. And today, you know, our hope really is to share a conversation with you in a place that’s safe, to also have a conversation with you and engage with you, uh, to talk about things which many times given, you know, our, our graduate lives and our professional lives, we don’t find those in the hallways of, of our departmental homes. So, this is a rare opportunity for us to share in a conversation among friends, among kindred spirits and engage for a moment in a way that we often don’t get a chance to. So, I, I really want us, the, the format of this whole process is gonna be a very informal process. Uh, it's gonna be talking story, going back and forth, you will see that, you know, these folks are, are rich, experienced, insightful folks who you, you just want to sit and watch and that’s what we're gonna get to do, uh, till around, I don’t know, about little after 11, about 50 minutes or so, okay? We're gonna do that and then, after that, you know, we really invite you to use the conversation we've had up here as a springboard for your own interaction, your own questions with us and so this is not gonna be a one-way thing, this is gonna be a two-way thing, all right? We're gonna dialogue back and forth. And then after that, particularly given, uh, the, the significance of this year's ceremony, we will have, we will have a passionate, important, kind of, ceremony towards the end with some of our students, okay? So, everybody on board? Yeah, we good? Okay. So, let me see here, so, the, the questions, and, and I've sent these to our panelists beforehand, really are structured around the core theme, which is honoring our legacy and empowering future leaders. We've got some questions around legacy, we've got some questions around leadership and then lastly, we'll wrap up around empowerment, okay? So, to start us all off and maybe get us, get a big picture of where things stand, you know, what do you all see as the significant accomplishments that we've made over the last 30 years in, in our field, in our discipline? What do you see as some of the significant accomplishments that you're proud of? Take it away, folks. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO I'll begin by, uh, acknowledging that I was at the first Roundtable 30 years ago and certainly at that time had no idea that I would be here 30 years later. You know, when you think about legacies when you're starting something new, you don't think about legacies when you're starting something new. Um, you get engaged because you believe in the idea, have passion for it and so forth. At the same time, uh, we’re always history making and we may not again, in the moment think about making history but that is in fact what the Roundtable has done, is create, uh, an important space for history in the profession, in particular, multicultural psychology. And then I want to reflect just on one more, uh, idea and that is nothing happens in isolation. That we've made the progress we've made in multicultural psychology because we built on the legacy of others, uh, whether it's individuals or movements. The Civil Rights Movement, that really spawned a lot of our thinking and our, our pro-action, uh, to get us, get the academic world moving. And, again, I think the academic world, a few people then had to make those, uh, initiatives and take charge. So, there are always concurrent forces at play when we, you know, when I look back, what's, how do we form a legacy, or how does a legacy develop. And then, finally, I'm als-, always reminded of a statement by Cesar Chavez and, um, you know, he said he would go out in the fields and he would talk to people and he would learn what people have to say about their lives, and I think many of us were, you know, in the trenches as young academics, as clinicians hearing from people and also knowing our experience, and he said what you want to do is make sure you leave a legacy behind for those you want to inspire, but also to show the care and love that you bring to your work. So, legacy is about inspiration, but it's also about love. 

00:16:35
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Other folks? 

00:16:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM I mean, for me, I think , um, you can't talk about legacy without understanding the, the spaces that inspired that generation of folk 30 years ago to create this space. Um, and so, we have to give credit, I think, to, uh, Sam Johnson. Those who haven't had a chance to meet Sam, how many folk have not meet Sam Johnson, by the way? Who’s the students here? Sam, stand up for us, if you would. 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It was Sam Johnson’s, uh, uh, vision, in collaboration with some other folk, that first, uh, thought about this whole space of the Roundtable. Back in the days before we had, kind of, massive emails, it was like telephone calls, I think, we all got from Sam. And I was a young, uh, assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania down the road hanging out with my home girl here, Michelle Fine, and, uh, having just been trained by, who we call our Queen Mother, Janet Helms, uh, that was the, kind of, spaces that we ran in and the shoulders that we stood on. So, I think, legacy really begins with that. And for me, I think, the legacy of the Roundtable was born out of that first year when we started on Friday, between Friday afternoon and Saturday it snowed something, like, about some 22 inches, I mean, kind of, shutting the city down. We were staying in some faculty/graduate student dorms or something somewhere close to here and everybody was so turned on by the conversations and the narratives that we all got up, everybody came back, trudged through snow, just to be here on Saturday to continue that space. And so, part of when you talk about legacy, it is really that energy, that spirit, that life-force that really the Roundtable was born out of; it just wasn’t another meeting, all right? It was a space that really had that energy, I think, that is, that is, uh, continued all these years and that’s a piece that I hope it doesn’t lose, because there's something special about the character of the Roundtable that is there. Uh, two last pieces, I think, for me, in terms of legacy. The first Is the discipline was so pronounced with its, kind of, air of cultural stability that what the Roundtable provided for lots of us was a way to establish a cultural comfort zone. So that, it doesn’t matter where you were in all the spaces and even for those of us who were academicians and clinicians and researchers and, you know, whatever our, our professional, uh, obligations were, this was the place where we could come to and know that we could get hugged up quick and soft and just, kind of, connect with each other in authentic ways and have conversations and, and really talk to each other in ways, it's like, ‘ I'm really not crazy, am I, because you see the same thing I do?’ That was that, kind of, cultural comfort zone that was so difficult to find. And now when you go places that, that the discipline wants to, kind of, have this, what I call fashionable multiculturalism; where they want to touch it up at the margins, or touch it at the surface, but don’t want to do the deep-dive or the deep-structure analysis on what it takes. When we went to Roundtable it was always a place, I think, that could do that. So, that cultural comfort zone, I think, for me, was important in that sea of cultural sterility. And lastly, for me, I think, what the legacy has done is, is, it is, uh, the ultimate, I think, expression of power. Um, real power, to me, is never military might. It's never who has the biggest, baddest police force, whether it's in New York, or Philly or Los Angeles. It's never, you know, who has the biggest, baddest military. Power has always been about, uh, as Wade Nobles reminds us, the ability to define reality and to make other people respond to that definition as if it were their own. The, the character, the genius, the legacy of the Roundtable was about seizing the high-ground in the discourse so that we could, in some cases, claim, in some cases refrain the narratives about our people in this space we call multiculturalism that allowed us to then launch really, and use this, this conference as a springboard to really do a lot of things that we were doing, I think, in cultural spaces. Because, at that point, other than maybe the Associations of Black Psychologists, there were not other spaces that we were looking at, um, uh, AMCB, I think, in the counseling world, but certainly in the psychology world there were not other spaces that we could go to for all of us to, kind of, gather in those particular spaces. But, for me, I think, that’s what resonates 30 years later. 

00:21:25
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Wow. Anyone else? 

00:21:30
DR. JANET HELMS Um, I think, maybe I would add that, for me, legacy has a lot to do with the relationships one builds, um, to carry on the history of whatever it is they were trying to accomplish. I was also here for the great blizzard, uh, Roundtable and it occurs to me that the way that I got here for that Roundtable is actually through one of my graduate students, um, at the time, or he had been one of my graduate students, Robert Carter, who for many years carried on the, uh, Roundtable after, uh, after Sam. Um, during the great blizzard, however, I became aware of two things, uh, one is during that blizzard, someone stole my leather pants out of a tr-, car trunk. 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:25
DR. JANET HELMS That's what I mean. 

00:22:25
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ You can tell, you can tell she's over that by now, though. 

00:22:35
DR. JANET HELMS Well, what that taught me is that people can be inventive under the most dire circumstances. But the other thing I learned from, uh, the experience of attending the Roundtable is that it's really important for people to have places where they can share themselves. And, I think, what makes the Roundtable unique is that no one quite gets that. So, since the Roundtable, there have been a number of con-, conferences that have sprung up around the country, all purporting to do something about multiculturalism. But many of them have forgotten that the thing that makes multiculturalism meaningful is the heart, the investment of the people who are actually trying to present a new perspective to the world. And so, what I've learned is that you essentially can't judge a book by its cover, you can't judge multiculturalism by its cover. I think we need to continually work to make sure that the passion remains in what it is that we're trying to do; otherwise, we won't make any significant changes. 

00:23:50
DR. MICHELLE FINE Go ahead, Rockey. 

00:23:55
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS Um, it's really great to here, be here, thank you. I really feel honored to be a part of this, so thank you. Uh, first that, that, the word legacy is, uh, is such a powerful word, isn't it? And to have it associated with this conference this year is amazing and, um, I, I'm gonna try to add something to what's been said, I hope. And, um, on the one hand, while legacy and influence upon future generations with our legacies is absolutely crucial, the influence that is made up on the persons who, who follow, who keep the torch burning, as we'll see, see later, while, that's incredibly important, the other aspect of legacy, I think, that's important to note is that there's, uh, preponderant, preponderance about legacy too. Uh, like, it's like, one of the things I'll always have to be very aware of when I try to mentor students and teach students is that I don't want it to be my influence to be undue. Because there's a tendency for those of us who try to attempt to be a part of legacy is to get our legacy repeated. And to get caught up in that repetition is to kill any potential legacies that might emerge later. And so, um, one of the things that I think is accomplished here, as I hear people talk and interact, is create, creating that space to be different too. And sometimes that involves some, it involves incredible similarities of interests to build up that similarity, to come somewhere where you can talk to people who understand what you've gone through and, uh, feel, uh, validated in that respect. Just as important as, for legacy is the experience contrast and even more important than that is to experience the resonance of wounding in those relationships and to work through those things so that you might emerge to be your own self, because, you know, if you're really gonna follow this legacy you gotta do that. You gotta create, you have to engage in the creative dynamic. And so, whenever I feel like a person likes me a little bit too much, wants to do a little bit too much of what I've already done, I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, I'm not doing my job.’ I need a little bit of that irritation at me every once in a while, ‘I gotta do what I gotta do Rockey and I'm not you, you know.’ I saw this show the other day where, I was watching the beat poets and Allen Ginsberg and what, what's that actor's name, um, Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp was, uh, was reading from ‘On the Road’ Jer, Jack Kerouac and he's reading it and, and Allen Ginsberg went up to him and he said, uh, ‘Hey, man, you're not reading it like Allen, like Jack Kerouac. You're not doing it right.’ And he looked at the great Allen Ginsberg and I thought if I was in his presence I wouldn’t dare say anything, but he did and he said, ‘I'm not Allen, I'm not Jack Kerouac.’ And that’s a pretty important part to remember, I think, about lega-, legacy, the legacy. To, to engage in the beauty and security and the acknowledgment and validity of similarities and shared understandings, but also have the gumption to engage in the contrast that, that's, that's involved in legacy and even the wounding that involves in cutting the umbilical cord and doing your own thing. 

00:27:55
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Michelle? 

00:27:55
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, so, I also want to honor Sam and Deral and Robert and Madonna and Marie, is that everybody? Who has, who has held this space and, and I, um, I want to deal with both the material and the metaphor of what it means to be a Roundtable, all right, not a square table, not a corporate table, not a corporate boardroom. Um, I'm having dinner with my brother tonight. My brother is 70 and he said, ‘Get a round table, so I can hear you.’ And that's what this space has felt like, a round table where we can hear each other. Um, I think, I was also there 30 years ago, maybe we're not so hot and sexy; maybe we're elders, shit. Um... 

00:28:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Oh, dang. 

00:28:50
DR. MICHELLE FINE Oh, dang, and I will give you those pants back. Um... 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:28:55
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, so, but, but I want to, if it were a square table, I want, I want to think about the four corners and elders who have held this space for me or, or ideas. Um, one is I hang out a lot, um, I, I, uh, hang out a lot with W.E.B. DuBois and his words. And, um, when he developed Crisis Magazine at, at the end of the 1800s, he, um, he argued that the importance of Crisis Magazine was to chronicle the quiet moans of the darker race, the ongoing crisis and, and he, and he said that, um, that elites would only notice the crisis when there was a prophet to be made. Um, and I can now go on a detour to charter schools and vouchers and high-stakes testing and, and even heavy policing the ways in which the crisis of structural and stark racism gets appropriated by capitalism In this country and multiculturalism being a, a front to there, right? Um, so, this space has held the crisis, even as it has held possibility. It's an astonishing accomplishment. The second corner is, I named all of those people who have held this space, because this space has also modeled what it's like to live through struggle and still survive. Those haven't been easy legacies, probably, for any of you; for some more than others, difficult. And yet, the space survived and, and it, kind of, grew from conflict, which maybe is, is a lesson for the next generation, not to stop at the hard moment, but to figure out what grounds us? What, where are our roots? What's the soil? How do we deal with the wounds? How do we repair and how do we move forward? So, that’s the, that’s the second and, um, Myles Horton has a book called ‘We Make the Road by Walking’, right? And that is what the Roundtable has been. The third corner is held by Gloria Anzaldúa, um, and then taken up by Maria Torre, a student and colleague of mine. The notion of ‘ Nos-Otros’; Gloria Anzaldúa has split the word. And invited this space and I say for me, in particular, as a white woman who has been so welcomed into, and honored, and honored to be here in this space. And for me, it always felt like a coming home, always. Um, because it was a space of ‘Nos-Otros’, ‘ Us-Others’, right? And, and at that hyphen was an enormous amount of love and affect, um, and, and commitment. And then, and then the fourth corner is held by Audre Lorde and her piece about ‘we can't dismantle the master’s house with the master’s tools’. And this space always feels like, and I'm, kind of, writing a paper back to Audre, cause I write to dead people a lot, cause I like them better than live people. Sorry. I like a lot of live people, but, um, like, this space was both that and that is this space was a way of saying, ‘This is our house, actually, psychology is our space. It's not the master’s space and we made those tools and these are our tools.’ And that, and that it's both a reclaiming and a critique of the illusion of inclusion, that that's always present, um, and the radical demand for inclusion knowing that the illusion of inclusion is always present. And the last thing I want to say about the amazingness of the Roundtable is that it then spawns other little puddles of, of work and love and passion and struggle all over the country and all over the world, because you dared to create a space that would then have multiple generations. And, um, for the last month I've been spending every Sunday with Donnie Cook and, uh, Linda Powell, um, who's a name I want to say aloud and I want you all to go read Linda Powell, because Linda’s now in hospice, and every Sunday we gather in Richmond, Virginia, we will again tomorrow. And that’s a different kind of Roundtable, um, but it's a carrying on of the, kind of, love that has been bred here to understand that we move forward, even as we say goodbye. 

00:33:40
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Well said. I think one of the things you can gather from here that this space that we've created, this isn't just a space for scholarship, a space for research, a space for, you know, papers. I think, really, what you got out of this folks here is a sense that this is a real space for community, a space for people and a space for a realness that you won't find in many other spaces out there. And so it's far beyond just the professional piece, this really touches on the soul. So, I want to thank you for really pushing us forward here, but looking forward also, um, what do you see as the challenges? You know, we've looked back on legacies, what do you see as the challenges for us as a field, what do you see as the challenges for this space as it continues to move forward? What's it look like ahead?

00:34:35
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ It's not easy to stump this group, by the way. 

00:34:45
DR. JANET HELMS Well, let me, sort of, move us out of the discipline, per se, for a moment. A lot of what we have accomplished so far happened because of the things that were happening in the society more broadly. Now, one of the things that’s happening in the society more broadly is that we have this dialectic going on, wherein, because we have an African-American president, one side says, in effect, uh, they've arrived, we don't need to do anything else. The, the other side, which is many of us, I would hope, recognizes that, in fact, what the African-American president has served as is a catalyst for people acting out the kinds of oppression they were acting out many years ago. The, the problem is, they're not just acting it out on African-Americans, but they’re acting it out on, uh, virtually all people of color, immigrants and people of lower socioeconomic status. If we buy into the argument that we're post-racial, uh, we don't want to contribute money to people who don't work, when, in fact, we know that the lower socio-, socioeconomic class works much harder than probably anyone else in society, it's just they don't get rewarded for their work; if we buy into those arguments what it means is that we as scientists then begin to study things that are not important to improving the conditions of our population. And I think, actually, we don't have the luxury of doing science just for science’s sake. I think what we do ought to, ought to have application, it ought to have meaning. So, where I hope we will go is to be the counterargument against the forces now that say, ‘Let's go back, let's go back to when it was the good old days.’ It was not the good old days for me and I suspect it might not have been the good old days where people who look like me, or think like me, and so I want us to, uh, keep that message alive through our work and I think we can do that. 

00:37:05

00:37:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM For me, I think, one of the, the biggest challenges of, of the Roundtable and all of us, uh, in moving forward is how to sustain what I would call human authenticity. You know, what, what the Roundtable has meant to lots of us, I think you’ve heard, uh, in a consistent theme, is it was a place to be authentically human. And whether authenticity was about giving voice to those who had something to say but were rarely heard, whether authenticity was about being able to limp in here every year and find the cultural comfort zone that would allow you to heal in the broken places, this was a very authentically human space. And, the challenge, I think, in trying to maintain that level of authenticity, is to not get so caught up into the, as Janet describes, the, the conference circuit so that this then becomes measured against some other places that, you know, can't approximate it. But we end up trying to match it on the number of presentations, then the number of posters, then number of those things that are characteristic of other conferences and that is the standard against which we measure it; because the more we, in fact, do that, you know, it, it, it takes us away, I think, from what I would call our truest selves. Um, this was a place where those of us who came found hope in the face of despair. It was the place where we found courage in the face of fear. It was the place where we found stability when that roller coaster of life that was just out of control had us thinking we were the problem and the issue. Anybody been there? Yeah? I mean, that to me, I think, is probably one of the biggest, biggest challenges. Um, before I was blessed to be mentored and, and, uh, trained by Janet, I worked with two other psychologists, certainly who mentored me. One, Horace Mitchell at Washington University of St. Louis, and we talked yesterday. And, and Nancy’s talk about the great Joe White. Uh, and Joe was my first mentor, but one of the first lessons he taught me is that you cannot seek validation from your oppressor. Let me say that again, you cannot seek validation from your oppressor. And so, every time we try to not simply dismantle master’s houses or question whether we can use master’s tools to do that, part of what is the biggest challenge psychologically, I think, is somehow having to believe that we have to approximate what it is that we see the oppressor doing. And, I close with, with a piece on this segment, that I was reminded by a piece of wisdom I learned from, I think, one of our leaders in, in, in America, who simply said that, ‘He or she who prescribes the diameter of your knowledge, also prescribes the circumference of your activity.’ He who prescribes the diameter of your knowledge, also prescribes the circumference of your activity. What was special about this place is that being authentically human had no limitation. Being authentically human, right, had no boundary when it came to providing empathy and support to each other as professionals, to each other as students and to the creative legacy, I think, even that Rockey was talking about a while ago, where you could just come and be. And that’s what I hope we don’t miss. That’s what, I think, has been lost in some of the other places around the country. The summits, the other places have just lost their soul. This is a place that hope doesn’t do that. Because human authenticity is too important to what we do. 

00:41:20
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Michelle? 

00:41:25
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, so, I have a couple of, um, very concrete suggestions and then a fantasy about how to be both a sauna and a social movement. And, and I think, this space has held both of those, um, but the world is pretty wretched these days and figuring how to both be a safe space and an activist space, um, there's not a tension, but one has to be deliberate about that. I think that, I think a real concrete issue is, and maybe this has been done Marie, is, um, we need an oral history of the Roundtable. We need, whether it's a book, or an article, or, we need, people need images of what is it like to come together around critique and hope, around, around research and organizing, around safe space and, and social movement. And, um, I feel like a lot of my work these days is, is about like writing little things to put in bottles for some generation not yet, right? So, they can remember there was a moment when, but I do think that, kind of, investing in an oral history of the Roundtable would be really, really important; particularly, while lots of people are still around. Um, and I'm just aware of the edges of all that, but, um, I just, I think, young people can't imagine what did it take to create this? Did you get a large grant from so and so and did you, right? They can't imagine the snow and, and the comfort of that, so, so that's one concrete. I think another, um, I, I spent a lot of, a lot of time doing work in and with prisons and in and around schools and, um, psychology has become the, kind of, scientific inc. of, um, social stratification and racist segregation in the name of high-stakes testing, in the name of psychological testing of who's crazy and who's bad, right? And, and psychology is really the, the, the substance that is being brought to bear to decide that some kids are not educable; some kids are potential criminals, right? And as we watch what's called ‘race to the top’ or ‘no child left behind’ get, um, enacted through psychological and educational testing, um, everybody says it's race-neutral, or they say it's race-neutral, even as we watch the bodies stratify in this neighborhood; who can get into the new charter schools or the new selective schools? You’ve gotta be a three or a four, right? People know what these crazy tests are, they're tattoos on the soul of children and you're a one or a two or a three or a four. Lots of the new schools in this area, middle and high schools, you have to be a three or a four. You're an English language learner from another country, you're a kid who hasn't done well on tests, but you're a brilliant poet, you're not getting in. So, there are bald spots in this neighborhood where kids have no local middle school to go to, right? And Columbia is implicated in a thousand ways. Um, CUNY could be too, if we had the money to be bad guys, we just don’t, you know, but we do other bad things. Um, so, so, I do think that taking on the hegemony, which has just become the oxygen of high-stakes testing, as though it were, um, natural and race-neutral and class-neutral is a really important project. And, I think, it's a project the Roundtable could take up. A sec-, a third project, I think, the Roundtable could take up is the bleaching of the academy; that is, we are watching the whitening of the faculty and the student body at our universities. There are more black kids at Harvard than at Baruch, right? That’s complicated, right? Places like CUNY have used the austerity 2008 to, to jack up our SAT scores, so, we're losing black and Latino kids who are now going to the community colleges. Um, and, and the, the racial diversification of the faculty of what, a 30 year project, has basically been a bit of a failure, right? And it's going backwards. So, that's another place that, I think, we could do some work. And then the third is really to, to have a deliberate retreat of elders and young people to think through, what does it mean to be a safe space and a radical space, what does it mean to be able to heal ourselves here, but also to raise up some of those hard issues, um, in higher ed, and in communities, and in the nation. 

00:46:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO I'll just add a couple more thoughts to the challenges and, uh, and it builds on what everyone has said and I, I always like to look outside of, as an organizational leader for, at now my third institution, it's always terribly important to know the forces at work that affect your work or your organization, your institution. And, I think, in psychology, looking at psychology as, quotes, ‘an institution and a discipline’ what I'm very aware of right now and what I think is, is again a challenge for all of us in the profession and perhaps those of us who are, are have been around a while is, you know, the whole, I think, focus on psychology, even APA on, on not questioning the MA in psychology is one thing that's going on right now. Now, a lot of our students, a lot of students of color, a lot of, um, low-income students start out in Master’s programs; they don't have the luxury of going right to, uh, a PhD program. So, those are, those are some of the forces that we all have to pay attention to. I think the second is, kind of, APA also questioning the PsyD and does that belong? And what does that mean, again, for many people who are practitioners and choose to then advance themselves, uh, through a PsyD program? So, we have to look at the stratification, um, in, in so many different places and, I think, what that means, the challenge is, you know, you can't let your guard down. I think we can come to these spaces and have these, uh, inspiring and enriching conversations, but I also think we need to do these reality checks. Because we can go back to the comfort of our, you know, academic program where you're mentored well, I hope you're mentored well, but as you all, and I'm saying this to especially the, the students and the emerging professionals, just be very knowledgeable about the world out there, you know? Read more than academic journals, know what the challenges are from technology, from globalization and how that affects your world of work and your future, uh, because it's gotten more complicated. And, uh, we need to know what, what the Wall Street Journal says, whether you believe in what the op-ed pieces or the editorial pieces, but you have to always know the other point of view. So, I think, psych-, as psychologists and training counselors and training, uh, we have to give ourselves that breadth of knowledge. And I, I, as we continue as a space here at the Roundtable, perhaps in the future, and maybe I'll built on Michelle's idea of recommendations, also creating a conversation around all of these other social forces that affect our work, uh, as students, as academics, as, uh, as practitioners, because it's all very real and there's no sense leaving school not thinking about all of this right now. 

00:49:35
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Rock? 

00:49:35
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS You know, my, my, my life is, um, when I'm at home in Oklahoma, um, go to sweats, Indian sweat lodge every two weeks, go to the peyote meetings pretty regularly, um, participate in ceremonies throughout the year and everything. And it gives me a, kind of, interesting perspective to live in that world so much of the time. Um, example would be, you know, how, and I'm thinking in terms of what you had mentioned a second ago about how we're prescribed to act and think and behave in certain ways. Like, uh, just a few weeks ago, we have some skins over here, we, we have some ‘Indins’, Indians over here in the corner and we were in a sweat lodge just a few weeks ago and then when, when I got out two days later, I was in London, England and I was at the Oxford Cambridge Club and, uh, when I went there, I had my cowboy boots and my jeans and I walked up there and I was told, told, ‘Um, you're required to wear a suit.’ I've never had a suit in my entire life. You're seeing the first suit I've ever had in my entire life. Somebody, I think, uh, somebody said that I look like a, a, a boy that’s been forced to go to Sunday school up, up here. I, sort of, feel like that too. These things are too tight and I can't breathe, it's awful. But anyway, and then I came back and I had my cowboy boots and they said, ‘You must where thin boots.’ What are thin boots? I don’t even know, but I got some and there's holes all in ‘em now because, you know, they, they, um, rub through walking around London. So, I have my thin boots on. But it was prescribed that I dress in a particular way to present at their, at their thing that they had going there on Charles Dickens. And so, it starts with that but it gets, the challenges that we have, there's these external pressures that we can see that are operating on us all the time in the field of psychology, but then also, there's also these ghosts, these invisible forces, and unobtrusively possess ourselves and when we don't even know it. And, uh, they come along in epistemological assumptions that we don't question, sometimes about, let's say, an MMPI, you know, and we go out and do an MMPI, and you have a Native Americans, the regular, not a clinical samp-, sample but 8 out of the 10 skills with a nonclinical scamp, sample there's 8 out of 10 of ‘em are 15 points over the top. I mean, they say things like, do you ever see strange things? Come to my peyote meetings, come to my sweat lodge, I promise you'll see, see some strange things. Well, that became, so it becomes very conspicuous to the person who lives in most of his life in a different world really to see that the assumptions that much of psychology has are incredibly Euro-American and, uh, if we don't and it's hard to get at ‘em, I mean, it's really hard to get at ‘em. And, so, anyway I, one of the things I would say our challenge continues to be to delve into the in, to, to see with eyes that are capable of seeing the invisible influences that shape us and possess us regularly, uh, in terms of testings, testing and in terms of, of, um, of treatment. You know, there's a movement right now among all Indian people is cultural interventions. You know, what is this sweat lodge doing? What is the peyote meeting? Those impact me. And there's others that are trying to combine psychology, western psychology and Indian ways to try to bring greater healing and health, but those things, they're just at the beginning and it takes incredible investigation to be able to reveal those things for what they are, because we're walking around, I promise you, every day in our thin boots and we don't even know it. So, that's one of the big challenges, the invisible forces, you know, are really important to look at in our field, I think. 

00:54:10
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ So, let's move forward with this idea of thin boots and learning how to keep walking in the boots that are given or the boots that we make for ourselves. So, I'm curious, let’s, let’s switch to the topic of leadership here, a little bit and, and, and, uh, if you could share your thoughts about what's one characteristic you believe every leader should have? What's one characteristic every leader should have? What's fundamental in that? 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO I'll give you two, Alvin. Humility, no, humility and fearlessness. 

00:55:00
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Can you say more about either one, Patricia? 

00:55:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Humility, I, you know, there's leadership that's positionality leadership, you know, you get appointed to something in an institution, in a professional group and, you know, all kinds of assumptions are made about that. Um, but I, I think as a leader it's a desig-, it's a word, it's a word, okay? There's some expectations that go with that, uh, but I, I am always reminded that I, I don’t know a lot. I mean, I know something, but I know a lot and, and so that humility is, is one about, uh, being willing to, uh, ask the questions to, uh, not make assumptions, to learn, I'm always a learner as a leader. Um, and, uh, and, and to, to take that, uh, sense of humility and, uh, and pride, if that goes with it, I mean, you go with it. And then fearlessness; I'll just go there now. um, you know, given a, being put in a position or elected to a position, or chosen for a position of, of leader, leadership is a lot of responsibility and there's also a certain amount of readiness you have to have to move into that because, um, you arrive, and I'll just speak for myself, I've arrived at different leadership roles, uh, not acci-, not accidentally. I mean, I've done my homework, I've had my experience to get either elected to an ACA presidency or whatever it had to be, to now being the president of the Chicago School of Professional Psychology; none of that was overnight, none of that was overnight. And over the years, then I have been able to learn again, uh, about what it means to take risks with the vision I believe in. Um, to frame coalitions to advance a vision I believe in whether it's again, in a professional setting or in an, uh, institution. Um, and, and fearlessness is what is also what I guess makes me feel bold at times to, um, not accept that you can't go there, uh, but to question the status quo and, um, and again, it's not just me. I, I've done it with my good friend Thomas on many occasions, um, but there's a certain amount of fearlessness that I have I would say personally, uh, uh, engendered or, or been able to come to because of, of a lot of learning that, that I've had and a lot of experiences that I've had. And I, I think it, it empowers me then to, to, to take some steps or to make some statements that are important for the cause that, or the institution, in this case, that I'm leading. 

00:58:10
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Can I follow-up there? So, how do you break through that fear? You mentioned a fear that gets engendered in you from so many, how do you take that step forward? How do you keep moving forward? 

00:58:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, you, yeah, that’s a great question, really, yeah. Um, it, it's about, you know, making mistakes along the way. Um, knowing that you, I've never be, believed, everything that I have done that’s, you know, maybe my names attached to it, it's been with other people and I gain confidence from knowing that there are other people who believe in the idea, who will validate the idea and together we figure it out. You know, many, many years ago, this was in the 80s and I was involved with the American Counseling Association Aces, which was a counselor education and supervision and I go to the conferences, I was a junior professor and all the people getting awards were white men and I was just, you know, obviously very bothered by that. Uh, this was all pre-email, I called a bunch of women I knew across the country and I said at that the next conference we have to organize ourselves because we can't allow this to continue, I said that in so many words. We did and the organization persists, that goes back to 1983 as well, so, it's about 30 years. Uh, but the point is that you, I think, you overcome some of those fears that knowing that other people also have that desire to make change. I think a leader is an agent of change, you know, we, we are essentially, um, there to facilitate change, uh, but it's never alone. 

00:59:50
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Thank you. 

00:59:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM For me, I think, uh, the way you break through that, one strategy I would recommend is to contextualize struggle. Um, you have to be able to sustain some level of historical memory. And I think, that’s what, you know, what Michelle was talking about a moment ago about the oral history, even though the Roundtable is important. Um, for most of us when we get in spaces, it isn't that we don’t know what to do, the real question becomes do we have the courage to do what we know has to be done. I remember being a, a, a young assistant professor at Penn, coming out of a APA program in Southern Illinois Carbondale, having been trained as an undergraduate before I went to school by an individual considered one of the contemporary fathers of the black psychology movement. And I remember sitting in a faculty meeting with, uh, our, kind of, cast of characters, uh, at Penn, big Ivy League reputation and saying, ‘Excuse me, but maybe it's me, but Philadelphia is a city that is 44% black and we are training not only masters, but doctoral students to step out into the world and provide psychological services to people that they are not qualified to work with.’ And in quoting, uh, AJ Franklin, who wrote a piece in, I think, about ‘75 in The Counseling Psychologist, I said there used to be a thing called, even when you diversify the ranks that put in a couple of blacks students, a couple of Latinos, and a few women, you know, some gay folk and, you know, whatever the demographic is, there is such a thing to be young, gifted and black within appropriate professional training. It ought to be unethical to continue to graduate doctoral students from the program, have them out there working in the population that’s 44% black and they have no training in how to work with black folk. And had a couple colleagues pull me aside and just whisper and say, ‘That’s not a way to make tenure.‘ The question was not, did I know the right thing to do; the question was, what was I prepared to risk? You know, when Patricia talks about risk-taking you're talking about mental risk, to think about something different, you're talking about verbal risk, the wi-, the willingness to just speak up, and behavioral risk, the willingness to do something unconventional. And so, contextualizing struggle of that is I always take myself back. You know, one of the most profound pieces I've been to in, in 2000, The Association of Black Psychologists had a convention through the 90s in cities that retraced, in backward fashion, from Toronto all the way down into Charleston in ’99, the steps of the Underground Railroad, ending with the convention on the continent, somewhere we would be in 2000; well, that happened to be in Ghana. And if I had my way in an unlimited foundation, I would take every black kid in the inner city that I know you spend your life working with and I would take them to one of them slave dungeons and let them just smell the stench and let them feel the spirit of their ancestors in those places. Because you couldn’t come out of spaces like that and do some of the crazy that we do all around this country. But it reminds me also that, if you contextualize struggle, then part of what I remind myself whenever you gotta go through something, whenever you gotta risk, whenever you're feeling a little anxious about, uh, I might not get tenure, oh, somebody might not like me, or whatever, that this ain't a slave ship. This ain't a slave ship. And given what they had to go through so that people like me, the opportunity for me to highlight whatever scholarly ability I might have was made possible by some folk who came along before me. So, I owe a debt and that debt has to be paid forward so that new generations of folk come. Leadership, to me, is not simply about what we are required to do. To me, what good leaders do is not just exercise command of whatever position they hold, but it is rather to inspire the leadership principle in other people that they influence, because everybody has the capacity to be a leader. And what I would say that, that in, in moving in that space, the notion of, of really empowerment requires that what you have to have in terms of leadership, I think, is a vision of possibility, so that, as healers, you never lose the capacity to believe that people can elevate themself to rightful places of rulership and mastery over their own circumstance. You can never lose, all right, the belief in the transformative possibilities of the human spirit. And in a society that’s so quick to discard people as disposable capital, when you don’t dwell on a test, or you, you know, uh, consider yourself a , a, a criminal because you're out there trying to make a way or whatever you're doing, we're used to kicking folk to the curb. And we, as healers, cannot afford to fall for that okeydoke. We can never lose the belief in the transformative possibilities of the human spirit.. That to me is what leadership requires. 

01:05:20
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Thanks, Thomas. 

01:05:25
[sil.] 

01:05:25
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Anyone else want to wrestle with that one? 

01:05:35
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, so, shoobluba, so I want to say something to the white people in the room, but the rest of you can listen. Um, uh, when we, there's so many Philly stories, I'm just flooded with them now and they're all at faculty meetings where we were both, like, constantly told, you're never gonna get tenure doing that, right? And we both, kind of, said to each other, like, who wants tenure if you gotta cut your tongue out and your heart out before you can get it, you know? And actually, we also watched some people go down who played it safe. This isn't to the white people, everybody can listen to me, right? Do you remember there was one, I don’t even remember, I'm sure she's fine, may she live and be well, but, you know, people who played it safe and were, kind of, good soldiers in someone else’s army didn’t get tenure because they weren't courageous. That, that, you know, Thomas and I and others, you know, kind of, made it, had big mouths, but made a set of allies and lived with an integrity and, not to say there's not risk, but anyway. So, that’s, but to the white people. So, one of the other things that happened in Philly, there was a huge social movement around, um, uh, educational transformation and reform and involving families and students and teachers and change and, uh, we even got good data, the details don’t much matter. And neither the district, nor the union was actually very interested in changing the way things were, right? And we were a coalition of mostly white and black women and men and those of us who were white were so surprised, me, so surprised that the district and the union weren't happy about the fact that we had figured out how to engage people in a participatory movement to create good schools that would actually increase the academic capacity of mostly poor and mostly African-American students. It was, kind of, like we delivered bad news rather than good news. So, those of us who were white, just got, and like, I just took to bed, right and drank. And Rochelle Nichols-Solomon, African-American organizer, like, came to me and said, you know, you’ve been like a cute white girl a long time and you're, kind of, used to like, look, wow, look, we got good data, we should like, close prisons and like change schools. She said, like, the struggle was long and hard, right? And when you hit a bump in the road, remember that the struggle was long and hard and the struggle forward is long and hard. And one of the things that, I think, those of us who have had it relatively easy, is like, oh, my God, this is never gonna happen and despair is not an option. It's an affect, right? It's a Friday night, but it's not an option. And those of us who are white actually have a responsibility to move it forward with allies; not assume we know best, but in struggle arm and arm. Um, but despair’s not an option, you know, I've met too many old women in Newark who have said, ‘Oh, I'm sorry you're depressed about that, but it's been like this for a really long time’, right? And it probably will be and I remember when Derrick Bell wrote, um, ‘Faces at the Bottom of the Well’ and said, you know, racism is gonna continue well after I die. And I remember thinking, oh, please don’t say that, right? I was at Penn. Um, anyway this long view is a really important one and, and, um, working in solidarity and using our white skin privilege in solidarity, not because we know best, not because we know how to talk, but because these problems are our problems and we have benefited from them. We have to shift the yen of analysis of what's the problem. When WEB DuBois was hired by Susan Wharton, Wharton School at Penn, 1899 he was hired because they didn't understand the Negro problem. And he knew he was hired for a racist project and he decided to flip the script and shifted from understanding, it's not a Negro problem, it's actually a structural, historic, race, economic problem. So, he went house to house and counted the number of people who were forced to live together without sanitary conditions, who then developed tuberculosis, who then didn't go to school because the schools didn’t let them. So, he flipped the script and that’s a, kind of, courage, 1899, funded by Susan Wharton that he dared to say. And then he actually left the academy because in 1903 in Atlanta he walked past a store and saw the burned knuckles of Sam Hose after a lynching and said the academy moves too slowly. So, we have to bring a kind, those of us in the academy, we have to bring that urgency; that is our responsibility. That is particularly our responsibility at public universities and I would say places like, Columbia probably get more public money than places like CUNY, so you too are a public university and that is our responsibility. Um, last thing I want to say about leadership, it's a funny term, it's not one I like a lot, uh, it leaves me itchy; not as itchy as elder, but itchy. Um, because, because, you know, my epistemology in life and in research is participation, radical democratic participation. We do research with people, by people, in prison, on the streets, who are experiencing ‘stop and frisk’, we assume they bring a knowledge; they're not just participants now, they're researchers, their colleagues. Um, and yet I know participation without leadership is actually problematic, but I really know leadership without participation is problematic. Um, and so, maybe at next year's Roundtable we need a conversation about what is participation with critical leadership look like, right? Um, because the fantasy of no leadership in participatory structures means that the most privileged people dominate and then other people leave and then people say, well, they didn't care anyway or they weren't very, so, and then, of course, leadership without participation is, kind of, what we've got now. Um, so, that’s a, I want to, kind of, queer the term leadership to understand that it, it has to have the capacity for deep participation, the nature of which we are still evolving. 

01:12:30
DR. JANET HELMS Well, actually I want to thank you for rephrasing the question, because I've been pondering what I think about leadership. It's such a hierarchical term and I really do not think about myself as being a leader. Um, if anything, I'm a facilitator and facilitation to me means that you learn from the people you are facilitating and you teach what you learn to the people you fac-, facilitating. But it requires you to have faith that people can be in control of their own destiny if you can, if you can help them and if they can help you to be in control of those destinies. So, I, I agree with Michelle. We, kind of, need to have a conversation where we maybe reconceptualize what we mean by leadership. Cause I don't think that term fits, I know it doesn't fit for me, I'm not sure it fits for a lot of people. 

01:13:35
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Rock? 

01:13:35
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS I love the fact that you said humility as the very first word and it goes right with what Janet just said there, in terms of, you know, leadership that hierarchical notion that she doesn’t go for. And so, I love the fact that you did, said that. And, of course, the fearlessness, I don’t want to diminish the importance of that, cause there's sometimes you have to dig in and you better be ready to fight, you better be ready to do it, I've been in those situations. But I want to go back to the humility just for a second. I think that we're in a crisis, in terms of our leadership, our facilitators right now, I really, I think, there's a, seems like everywhere I go everybody’s fighting with each other in their departments and everything else and they hate each other and they end up not being able to work with each other and it's just, it's a real crisis. I mean, it's just unbelievable how many places are in those situations. And so, this is what I would say about that, as facilitators, I'm gonna use your word Janet, cause I like it better, as facilitators, I think, what we, our responsibility, our main responsibility is to help people connect spirit to spirit in our groups and the beginning of that is to realize that we all came from same mother, Mother Earth. And it, it doesn’t matter if you're Indian, if you're African-American, if you're Asian, I mean, whatever, we all came from the same mother. I mean, you look across the table, you see a human being that is of the same spirit you are and that when you engage in label-, labeling them or castigating them and thinking negatively about them, you're not creating harmony. Uh, and it's out of, in har-, harmony is important. It leads most of the time in groups in order for people to join together and really do something. So, the, the humility begins with the idea that our first responsibility as facilitators is to help each other become more human. That's our word from almost every tribe, did you know that? Cherokees, you know what the word for Cherokee proudly is defined as? Human being. And, uh, Cheyenne, human being; to become human beings and to recognize that in the people that we work with. So, I think it starts with humility too. Thanks. 

01:16:10
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ I'm noticing the time, so I'm gonna move this along so we can, uh, talk to the group, but just one closing question that I want you to wrestle with around theme of empowerment. What you know now, that you wish you had known earlier in your career? What do you know now, that you wish you'd known earlier in your career? Take a few short stabs at that one. 

01:16:40
[sil.] 

01:16:50
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS I watched that way first, see, so, okay? 

01:16:50
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Oh, yeah. 

01:16:55
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS And I won't, I won't be long about this. The, the thing that came up to me, that the spirits told me to talk about just now, what I heard in my ear was, one of the things that, I think about certain regrets that I had and, um, one of ‘em is that I had this wonderful mentor and, uh, this is one, like, confession or something, but, I had this wonderful Kyowa man who was in Ind-, Indian education for years and mentored so many students. I mean, so many Indians got masters degrees, you know, our average level of education is ninth-grade; in northeastern Columbus, sixth-grade. And so, um, he had, every year he brought in like, 10 or 12 students that got masters degrees, Indians; I'd never seen an Indian with a PhD before, I think there's almost 100 now, it's incredible. I mean, but things began to happen and he was a major part of that and I traveled with him all over the United States. And then, I left education and I went, was, sort of, and then I went into psychology. And over the 10 years I've seen maybe every couple of months he'd call me up and he'd say, ‘Hey, Rock, come over here and let's make a Country and Western album on a tape.’ And we'd have, he'd have Willie Nelson and all these people he'd put, he'd put on there and I'd sit with him. Well, at the end, he got diabetes and, um, he calls me up, I hadn't seen him, like, for three months, and he calls me up and I go over and I sit with him and he says, hey, when I get ready to leave he says, ‘Hey, I got something for ya.’ I said, ‘What?’ And he went into his bedroom and he came out and he gave me his boots. They weren't thin. They were cowboy boots and he gave me his boots and I said, ‘I'm not, I'm not gonna take your boots.’ And he said, ‘No, I, I want you to have my boots.’ And so, he gave me his boots and then I didn’t see him for, like, two months and I heard he died. And, they called me, Jacob Zowtie(ph), he calls me up and says, ‘He left a message he wanted you to come and talk, give a talk at the burial.’ And, um, I was really hurt, you know why? I never showed him my appreciation. I never appreciated him for what, I never really let him know how much I appreciated him. And that’s something, when I look back, I wish I could've done that more often. You know, like, like, Marie, thank you for what you’ve done for me. I wanted to say wado, wado. A thank you for telling me, do what you love, write about what you love. You don’t have to do this stuff. I'll never remember, never, ever forget that conversation. But what happened with that is, um, went to and met my, White, White Bear, my medicine person that I work with and he said, uh, he went in a spirit world and he said, uh, he just said, uh, ‘He calls you his son. He doesn’t call you his friend. He calls you his son.’ So, the gift in that experience, I feel, maybe is what I'm talking about right now. Uh, appreciate the little things that your mentors do for ya and tell ‘em ‘wado’, ‘thank you, thank you for this’ or you'll regret it, possibly. And, um, I'm gonna go back and put his boots on and hopefully walk in ‘em half as well as he did, you know. But appreciation is what I was, I would change. 

01:21:10

01:21:10
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Other folks? Anyone? 

01:21:30
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, one of the things I really, um, have been overwhelmed with over the, I don’t know, 30 years of whatever I do, um, is, is the human desire to be free, to be recognized, to be, um, to be educated and to be in solidarity. I, I meet that in prison, I meet that with young people who were pushed out of their high schools, I meet that on Saturdays; we have a project at the Graduate Center called ‘Stats in Action’, where high school kids who were dropping out of their schools or, or staying in, come and help us do statistical analyses of the New York Police Department ‘stop and frisk’ data. And they, you know, they might have failed their math regents, but they're really good at analyzing NYPD statistical data. It's funny if it's, if it's relevant, you know. Um, I met it in prison where women who had been told, you're not college material, you're shit. So yearn to be educated, that desire, which I wrote about 100 years ago, but desire is deep. Not to be free as in separate, not to just walk alone in a meadow, but to be free with others, to look back, to look forward. I,I think, I didn't actually, I, I believed it 30 years ago, but I didn't really know it. And I didn't know I could find in all these places and that it would be the wind underneath my wings. Um, I also didn't know about the power of story to carry, and carry, and carry. So, on January 17th, last year, my mom passed away and, um, so, we had that beautiful, if someone's not in pain, that beautiful last set of moments. And, um, my friend Kathy Boudin, who was in prison, who had been imprison, sent me a book of, um, letters and stories from mothers to daughters. Her mother was friends with Tillie Olsen, who wrote the book. And Kathy’s mother had sent Kathy, when she was in prison, the book. And when Kathy’s mother was dying, Kathy read from the book to her mom, right? So, she gave it to me and then I read to my mom. And my mom, Rose, um, was laying there and I was reading something by Zora Neale Hurston and, and Hurston said, ‘As my mother laid there she couldn't speak but I looked in her eyes and I knew that she was asking me to speak for her.’ And I said that to my mom wh-, Rose, who was the youngest of 18 children, not very educated, adorable, by this time she was, you know, 4’ 8”, all breasts, and Yiddish, and in and out of whatever and she said, ‘I've so many stories to tell.’ And I said, ‘ Tell me.’ She said, ‘I, I can't, you.’ And so, that reminds me of, of your work Rockey, or your honoring of the past or, or Janet’s humble refusal to see herself as a leader and Patricia’s story of generations of work that she's done. Um, so, I think, I didn't know how much stories carry and that you just honored that man by speaking that story. Um, but I also didn't know how much the desire to be a part and to be recognized is so deep. And psychology just, we've erased that recog-, those of you who do clinical work know this, the desire to be recognized. When I meet a kid, were doing, this is the last thing, we're doing this project of formerly incarcerated college students. It's a participatory project, so, there are like 12 formerly incarcerated college students, myself and a graduate student. The project is called ‘The Gifts They Bring,’ right? Because it's the gifts they bring to the academy. that the academy doesn't want to know about because it won't let them say that they're formerly incarcerated, but they know so much. So, I, I just didn't know the desire ran so deep, and gifts ran so deep, despite betrayal, despite structural violence, there's still the capacity to want to connect. 

01:26:15
[sil.] 

01:26:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM For me, I think, if I knew then what I know now, and I don’t know that it, I would do it any differently, I think, because growth over time demands, I think, that you have to, kind of, move through growing spaces. Um, when we all set out, I think, early in our careers, um, and I was engaging in my graduate training and, and earning a career as a young professional, you know, who did both academics and research and, um, clinical work, there was a desire to want to be the best you could be. The challenge was never in the outcome, cause you never know whether you really achieve it, really, it really is in the process of just trying to maintain that sense of struggle. So, as you go to master the theories and you master, you know, the testing assessment and do all the clinical work and, you know, do all those things to try to get the high style marks, you know, on which your research is accepted or your clinical work is validated or, you know, your classes get good grades; all these, kind of, things that we do and play for the, kind of, artificial marker. What I learned and, and, and, uh, reinforced, I think, by the great Asa Hilliard, um, who I miss, I miss his spirit and I miss him. Uh, one of our greatest teachers, but he simply said, ‘ There's something wrong with the theory of discipline that leaves us strangers to ourselves, aliens to our culture, oblivious to our condition and inhuman to our oppressors.’ And in that space, it reinforced, I think, what Joe White had, had taught. So, you see these levels of convergence across, uh, different spaces and time come together to, kind of, reinforce that. And, I think, that has always, um, helped to define, I think, what I've tried to do really in the, kind of, mid to later parts of, of my career that has spanned way more now than this 30 years, you know; we actually have a couple grey hairs now. Um, but it's trying not necessarily to be the best at what people prescribe you to be, but rather be the best of what you are and being appreciative and humbled by the gifts that you’ve been blessed to bring into the world. But also, that, so that you can then be the conduit through which that other energy flows, you know, and that, kind of, mode that Janet was talking about, in terms of facilitator. Um, and I don’t know that I would have wanted to have learned it any differently because that’s part of what growth and maturation is about. But I think, it has helped me to crystalize my role so that instead of, of being the psychologist, you know, in the world, what I really aspire to be is a healing presence in the lives of other people. Um, but I'm glad I know that now. 

01:30:00
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Patricia? 

01:30:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Um, just a couple of thoughts and, uh, it's a hard question, actually and what, uh, and I've sat here pondering it, um, for the last 10 minutes, I think, and it's because so much occurs over your lifetime, over the last 30 years, and, uh, clearly, um, life experiences and mistakes and trips and successes and all of that, um, you don't know how that's going to happen, it, it happens and then, you know, you grow from that. Um, but the thought that came to mind was, um, in the early 90s and, you know, literature on women I was, uh, trying to read as much literature on women throughout my career, but it was a Gloria Anzaldúa’s book, uh, Entra Fronteras, I think, came out in ’87. And, uh, the book really, uh, earlier I had read porter new, uh, New Psychology of Women, this was in the late 70s, a Jean Baker-Miller's book, which was very validating and I thought, ‘Oh, wow, okay, there's stuff that I've been living that now I see in print.’ Uh, but Gloria Anzaldúa’s Entra Fronteras, which is, um, Living in the Borderlands, uh, in so many words, uh, really said to me then, um, that my, uh, kind of, my life feeling as though I was in all of these different places trying to walk on, on these different pathways and margins and times was not a un-, well, I didn't think it was unique, but to read it again and to have it in the voice of a Chicana, um, South Texas, I'm not south Texas, but it was the experience and it was the, the way she could phrase the, uh, the life of someone who had been marginalized, but had some privilege at the same time. And I, I, looking back 30 years ago, you know, it was a time of confusion, you know, junior person, you don't know how, where your life is headed, uh, professionally and even personally. Um, but that, but that book, I continue to refer to, um, because of the poetry and, and the prose, both that validate, uh, my own sense of, of ethnic identity, my own sense of womanhood and, um, what it means to remind myself that I have to continue to walk the margins. 

01:32:40
[sil.] 

01:32:45
DR. JANET HELMS Oh, in the midst of all of these answers that make you cry, um, I think, maybe I have a totally self-centered answer to that. Um, it is such a complex question, but, I think about how I came to be where I am and I didn't actually have mentors in my life and so I can't make you cry by telling you about my mentors. Maybe I can make you cry by telling you how much I suffered because I did not have mentors, but I think maybe what I learned is that sometimes you are in circumstances where you have to compromise. And I hate to say that in the midst of all these activists, but, it is true. And one of the compromises I had to make just to get through graduate school was to study things that I was not the least bit interested in, because those were the things that my professors were interested in. And so, they always said to me, if you want to make it into the academy, uh, what you have to do is to study what we study and on the side maybe, as a hobby, you can study what you're interested in. Well, as I, which is essentially what I did and as I contemplated my life, I thought about, if I have to spend my life studying these itty-bitty issues that are not of interest to me, maybe this is not the right field for me. But now as I look back, having maintained my two lines of research, most people don't know that I have two lines of research. They think the line of research that I really was interested in is my primary, uh, was my only research. And occasionally people run into something from the good old days and say, ‘Is that the same Janet Helms?’ I say, ‘Yep, that was me.’ And so, what I've learned, I guess, is that you never know where you'll end up when you take a path. Sometimes you end up in the places that you are least likely to think you would. 

01:34:50
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ So, as you can see, these folks here have shared not only their expertise, although I think they would all hesitate to label it that, not only their leadership, which I think all of them would hesitate to label it that way. But I think what you found, in the time we had together here is you’ve had five people who have shared with you their passion, their love, their spirit, their, their realness for why they continue to stay in this field and continue to inspire us. So, on the basis can we give these folks a round of applause, please? 

01:35:30
[sil.] 

01:35:30
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ As I said, this was a conversation, not only among five folks, but also with the room together. So, I, I would invite you, you’ve heard a lot that, I've seen people here writing every time so-, some pearl of wisdom rolls out, so I imagine this has stimulated a lot of thoughts or questions. Uh, put yourselves out there and, uh, we've got some mics here. Um, let’s take a few questions then. 

01:36:05

01:36:05
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Dr. Copley? 

01:36:10
[sil.] 

01:36:10
DR. KEVIN COPLEY Thank you. um, first of all, I want to say that I, um, truly appreciated hearing, um, from our sexy elders, uh... 

01:36:30
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ We're gonna get t-shirts done by the end of the conference, by the way. Okay. 

01:36:30
DR. KEVIN COPLEY Um, you know, I found myself, when I was listening to you, thinking about, um, the nature of the work that we do and, you know, if you know anything about me, I'm very much into, sort of, the politics of our work, um, in its various manifestations. And, I don’t know, are we allowed to talk about politics in this space? You know, can I, can I say Democrats and Republicans or is that impolitic? 

01:36:55
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ If you can't do it here, I don’t think you can do it anywhere. 

01:37:00
DR. KEVIN COPLEY Okay. So, um, so we are in, you know, we've just experienced a, a, a second historical election and, and one of the things that we know is that what greatly aided President Obama was the coalitions that were, um, built in this increasingly diverse society that we live in. And so now we see, um, on the other side, a panic because they realize that they can no longer continue to go about business as usual if they have any intentions of grabbing poll power again. And so, now there's this new attention to, um, diversity and allies and how can we make our party more appealing ? And I'm wondering from your perspectives, what role, um, does the work that we engage in in social justice work, multicultural work, what role can we play in the coming elections as the political parties continue to vie for the attentions of this very, um, diverse populace that we are, um, a part of? What role can psychology play in that discussion? 

01:38:10
[sil.] 

01:38:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO The, the first thing that comes to mind, and it, this is a really great question, Kevin, and, I think, one that obviously evokes an opportunity for anoth-, you know, a larger discussion. Uh, when I think of congressional hearings and who gets called to congressional hearings for different reasons, let's say the immigration bill right now. I mean, they ought to be calling Melba, they ought to be calling people do the work, um, on, with immigrants and, and to really talk about the effects of, of the unauthorized young person and family. They ought to call psychologists who work, who are working with those populations. When we look at the issues of, of gun violence, whether it's in Chicago and, and LA, I mean, they ought to be calling psychologists who are working within those communities to look at, again, it's the intersection of poverty, um, uh, and violence; and just, a report that just came out in, in Milwaukee about the three ZIP Codes where the greatest violence occurs is where the greatest poverty also exists. Psychologists need to be called upon or we need to, again, um, invite ourselves, uh, working with APA to be at those tables, because that's, that’s part of educating, um, a, a person who makes a vo-, who casts a vote, who's, who's a decision-maker, uh, and, and providing more information that we already can speak about. 

01:39:55
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Let's take one more answer on this question so we can get more folks up here, but anyone else want to wrestle with this one? 

01:40:00
DR. JANET HELMS Um, one of the discussions that we never have is that the majority of people who voted for Obama were not white people. Most, in fact, most of the people who invited, who voted for Romney were white people. And we have a system now where we have two parties, a white party and an integrated party. Uh, and so, I think by not having the discussion about how race is actually still impacting how our society is functioning, we're doing a great disservice. So, if I had a recommendation for them, I would say they need to, the Republicans, actually, need to invite me in to talk to them about white racial identity, so that I could help them. 

01:40:50
[sil.] 

01:40:50
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Uh, Kevin, I think you got your answer to that one, so, let's, let's move, let's move on. Somebody else want to come up to the podium or toss that, yeah, please. Come on up. 

01:41:05
UNKNOWN I am an, a, uh, middle school, um, teacher. I also teach, um, at a SUNY College, SUNY Old Westbury. And my question, things I see that, um, psychologists have done a lot of work, a lot of research and there is a lot of research written, um, and there is so much for, um, us as professionals to read and understand. But I see that, that the psychologist department, um, can lead and push more for, um, teachers or other professionals in other areas, yeah, engineers, or scientists, uh, to take more psychology classes. For example, um, for teachers, we do take one or two psychology courses, which is just, uh, not enough information for all of us to deal with 300 students every week, or to be able to serve better, um, parents and students. Um, so, I always think about, um, our profession that we just; in my field, for example, as being a teacher, I just feel that we are very short, um, with knowledge, uh, to be able to help better our students and parents. Um, just, um, looking at the, um, Hispanic, uh, population in our buildings, for example, um, we have a large percentage of students that are coming from Latin America, uh, from countries where they suffered, um, five or 15 years of war and revolution and they are here in, in with us in the schools and us, as teachers, don't have enough knowledge to deal with that part. Thank you. 

01:43:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO I'll just comment quickly, uh, trauma-informed care and, uh, teaching traumatized children and working with traumatized children in schools, I don't know what the State of New York is doing about, uh, promoting that, kind of, uh, policies that teachers do in fact have to learn that. In Wisconsin, we have had a lot of action on, uh, classrooms, creating classrooms where children who we know have come from traumatized, it could be, again, violence in the neighborhood, um, are, are learning what trauma looks like, might sound like, uh, for, for children. Um, so, it's something I think from the State Department of Education or other places where that can, I don’t know, it gets more complicated but, uh, I agree with you. I think there are so many more things that teachers need to know to, uh, work with kids who come from different circumstances, including trauma. 

01:44:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Why, why are we surprised that school systems don't teach teachers what they need to know to work effectively with kids? Like, why is that? This is 2013. Um, one of the challenges, I think, for us is, you know, to, to move into a space where we develop a level of personal empowerment ourselves. There, there's a piece I write about in, in, in my own, uh, uh, work that describes what I consider to be the biggest problem confronting the African-American community, but I think it confronts us all, as people of color and women. And it's not drugs, gangs, violence, poverty, racism, white supremacy, I mean, all of those are forms of obstacle, but it is what we call the need for mental liberation. Carter G. Woodson was prophetic when he wrote that if you allow people to control the way you think, you don’t have to assign them to an inferior status as necessary, they will seek it for themselves. It is absolutely fascinating to me why we still sit in, you know, these, these spaces of, of uniformed incompetence, even as teachers complain about the academic institutions who don’t teach us what we need to know, as if somehow we needed a permission slip from them to go learn what it is we have to do. I mean, I've been in schools consulting with Michelle, even in Philadelphia, where we spent lots of time and you couldn’t get teachers to come to training we were providing unless the union said we're gonna pay you time and a half to come. There's something wrong with a picture like that. And so, I would argue that, on one hand, you have to have a systemic remedy, which is universities and schools and programs need to better align their curriculum with the challenges, I think, the teachers face in the school every day and in the communities, absolutely true. But you can't relegate our intervention to systemic remedies alone, you can't forget there's an individual part to play in that. Because with the resources that you have available, with the information that’s out there, with all the folk who are writing all this magnificent stuff, you don’t need a permission slip to read Janet Helms or Michelle Fine or Patricia Arredondo, you don’t. You simply have to decide that you have the collective and individual will to say, ‘I refuse to allow other people to define and frame the discourse for me, and I'm gonna go read it myself.’ I hope that’s what you do. 

01:47:15

01:47:15
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS Um, I just want, I just want to thank you for working so hard as a school teacher. I was a school teacher from 1979 until 1984 at the Kickapoo Indian School up in North Eastern Kansas on the reservation and I remember thinking, when I went to work there that I couldn't imagine a harder job, ever. I was utterly exhausted every single day. I was one of the hardest jobs I've ever, until I had my son. I raised my son by myself and I learned that it's harder to be a mom. You have to get up every morning and go to work without any sleep for three years or something. But, I really appreciate your work. And, but some of the things that, and I really like the fact that you're so interested in giving more holistic kind of education with your, those kids that you're working with and I just, the fact that you have that attitude is fantastic. Um, one of the problems I ran into as a teacher though, it was important to know the psychology stuff and we didn't have enough, because we had lots of people with all sorts of trauma at our school, but the problem with the psychology stuff was it didn't include Indian values and things like that. And so, to incorporate the psychological ideas within, to a community that was so different from Western psychology, was a major problem. And so, um, you know, I remember wrestling with those kind of things, but doing my best to create circles inside of classrooms instead of squares and allowing them spaces, I love the way we've been using this word ‘ spaces’, to try to create heterotopic, heterotropic spaces in or places where they could feel safe for once in there, to be able to work on the stuff they needed to do. It's a hard task and one of them is you have to, it isn't, psychology won't be the answer, not for a bunch of Latino/Latina people. It’ll have to be mixed with, uh, uh, with your own values, because we're, we haven't got there yet. Yeah. 

01:49:35
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ I think there's one more response on this and then we'll take one more from the audience. 

01:49:40
DR. JANET HELMS Um, I, I appreciate your, your comments and your interest too. I think we devalue teachers. We expect teachers to do everything. Students are traumatized, tea-, teachers should treat them. Uh, students are shot in school, teachers should arm themselves. Um, what I think hap-, has happened in our system is that we have totally demolished mental health services. Theoretically, at least, mental health professionals are the people who should be dealing with some of these issues so that teachers can, can teach. So, if anything, I think one thing that teachers can do is, is to begin to be activists for including mental health professionals in their school. I understand that resources are limited and when resources are limited, the mental health professionals are the people who are kicked out of the system. But we as a community, we as teachers, we as professionals, we as parents, whoever we are we, we can't let that happen, because what we see is that if we don't help students deal with their trauma early on then it shows up in ways that we do not like later on.

DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Let's take one more question. Yeah. 

01:51:05
JESSICA ESPOSITO Hi. My name is Jessica Esposito(ph). I'm one of the students here at TC, um, and, I think, referring back to the conversation about courage and risk-taking, I was wondering how you find the patience in your lives to keep going when society hasn’t embraced the way that you think and the resilience to, um, allow them to catch-up with you? 

01:51:25
[sil.] 

01:51:25
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ How do you keep on, keeping on? 

01:51:30
[sil.] 

01:51:30
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, I don't, um, I don't know what the altern-, it doesn't feel like what we do, what we do is courageous. I don’t know what the alternative would be for me. I feel like we're here a really short time on this Earth. We are surrounded by injustice. I think we just have to figure out how we entered that space with the most dignity, courage, allies and laughter and for me wine; some of you it might be something else. That, that we can I, I, I have to say there are days where I feel like we've been doing this work a long time and it's worse maybe we should retire. On the other hand, I find such, um, I, I just such encouragement in, um, when we do work with communities, you know. So we're doing this work around Yankee Stadium on ‘stop and frisk’. We've got a PAR project with six young people, two old ladies, a former correction officer, a bodega owner and they’ve collected data from 3,000 community residents about their relationships with the police. And a couple of months ago on the chilly Tuesday night we organized, like, a public data feedback session in a plaza. So, first the Dominican drummers were drumming and then all the researchers gathered and then we had this guy called the illuminator, it's a truck that came out of the occupy movement that projected the data onto the side of the building and the co-researchers read it and it, you can go online at the public science project and see the clip, it just said ‘Dear NYPD’ right and all of a the sudden whole community was like, out. ‘Dear NYPD, you know, we are the Morris Justice Project. We surveyed 3.902 people, 48% of our young people have been stopped by you and called a racial name. Please don't do that, we don't like to call our children racial names. 62% of our young people were thrown to the ground, please don't do that.’ Then Miss Pearl gets on and say, ‘Don’t get us wrong, we want you in our neighbor. We just want to be policed with dignity, right? We understand that you made 2,712 stops last year and you got eight guns. Last week, our local church did a gun buyback and got 85 in an hour and they didn't call anybody a racial slur, right?’ And it went on and on and then people started, like, hanging out their windows saying, ‘ This is our home.’ That kept, that was like, the mantra. And it was just, like, this is what public science is, this is what psychology should be. And so, while I'm interested in being at those tables in Congress, I also think we need to be giving away psychology and organizing with communities that are so hungry to be researching injustice, so that they understand that there's another way that could be. During the summer, we offer Critical Participatory Action Research Summer Institutes for graduate students, faculty and activist teams from all over the world. We barely advertise and we have applications from, like, 200 people for 40 slots, but there is so much hunger. Um, so, so, so to the questions of Democrats and Republicans, we need to press APA, you need to press SPSSI now, hello, those of you on SPSSI council, right? We need to press the public interest directorate, Gwen Keita, is eager to be pressing these agendas. We need to remind them that psychologists actually don't all support torture, right, don't all support high-stakes testing, don't all support medicalization of social and political problems. So, so I want to push policy in our professional organizations, but I also want us to realize we've got allies in the community. That actually gives me courage, watching Janet make gorgeous babies that grow up to be, and I'll see Donnie tomorrow, right? The work with our students to realize that, um, you know, Fox news doesn't like what we have to say, but actually, a lot of people are interested in these counter narratives. This is not just a minority position. We are a radical margin within the field, but not within the world. Critical psychology is a dominant force in South America, in Europe and South Africa. In this country, I think, CUNY's the only one who calls itself critical psychology, but there's a bigger world. And so, I think, we just have a, kind of, responsibility, both to be at the big tables, the policy tables, but also to be organizing and to acknowledge, you, you were saying that, you know, Republicans are now trying to mobilize, you know, that black face that they're, like, Photoshop-ing in that poor, right? University of Wisconsin got caught Photoshop-ing black faces into their football stadiums and, it's like what the Republicans are doing. Um, but one of the things they're really smart about is that they're smart about where there is pain, they go in for the pain, they mobilize the opposition to public schools, to Democrats, then they sell them something, online higher ed, the newest, which is a response to the tragedy of the undereducated student of color. It's being sold to black mothers who have three children and two jobs and can, you know, do their undergraduate degree online at two in the morning, just swipe your credit card. I was just at a talk that actually said that. And actually, African-American college students who were doing it online have now the highest debt, because they drop out because it's an unsustainable model. So, what they have figured out is actually how to go to the pain, while we're all, many of us are ignoring the pain. So, they mobilize the pain, they capitalize the pain, they make a profit and then they betray; and that's a call for us to be little more responsive to where the real pain is. Okay. 

01:58:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Like Michelle, I think, um...(crosstalk) 

01:58:05
[sil.] 

01:58:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It, it never feels like what we do is, is courageous. I mean, we don’t, last time I looked, we don’t have white horses and ride in and, kind of, save the day and whatever, we just do what we've been blessed to do. Um, you know, each of us, I think, like each of you, is a seed of divinely inspired possibility. And that if we nurture it in a proper context, it grows into the fullest expression of all we are supposed to become. Our task simply is to, is to manifest, you know, ways in which, uh, and give honor to those people who have invested time in us, be it the creative force in the universe to the mentors and other folk; to give back just a little bit of what they’ve given us. It doesn’t feel courageous, it just feels like that’s what you're supposed to be doing. Um, there is no greater blessing in life, I think, next to being a parent and I'm a parent of two, then being trusted with the intellectual and personal growth and development of young people. You know, I think, you're right that that is probably the most important job we have and whether we are in primary, middle-school, secondary or universities, I mean, that’s an awesome task that we have. And so, that is a piece that I think, is so, uh, profoundly, um, moving that in order to give the proper credit and respect to, you know, that, that, that, uh, profession, you have to approach it with that level of passion, you know, that requires that sometimes we speak out against social injustice, that requires that we somehow reframe, you know, the narrative, that requires that even for Republicans and Democrats that we unpackage the packaging that people are providing to folk who are such non-critical consumers of information that people, kind of, fall for the okeydoke at the time, because they never take time to really dig below the surface to find out. I mean, that really ought to be, you know, our role. You know, that’s a piece that I think, is there. And always come back to, you know, to the legacy. I mean, I, I come out of a family where my mama raised four kids by herself, never earned more than $18,000 a year. And went to work for the government 32 years, which is time off to have, you know, my siblings and I. And two sons with a PhD, a third college educated, nobody on drugs, nobody in jail, nobody in a gang. You know, that isn't the, kind of, Ebony Magazine and Essence Magazine story they tell. But what she had was, was, was what Cornel West describes as, as that, kind of, black striving in a twilight civilization. What she had was that spirit, that energy that didn’t allow her the luxury to say, can I even pause and stop and say how am I gonna make it. She had faith to just believe that it's gonna be all right. And what we all came to understand, what I understand now, even as, as an adult, is that all those people that we think have power are really not that powerful. You know, if we have a little lunch and a little gnat flies on and takes a crumb off the plate, whoever you think is the most powerful person on the planet, doesn’t have the power to say, ‘Hey, gnat, bring me my crumb back.’ But they can order you and direct you in ways that we submit to them. There's nothing I fear in this life, except God, short of that, everybody else is a human put their pants on the same way I do, all right? We are obligated to be able to give something back to those who allowed us to occupy this unique space and time. That’s what we do. 

02:02:00
[sil.] 

02:02:00
DR. MICHELLE FINE (inaudible ) get it, that trauma, but I'm just a little worried that in the hands of psychologists, trauma becomes pathology and, um, and so I know this isn't a full answer but I do want to say that I feel like I've worked with a lot of people in traumatized circumstance and actually converting trauma into wisdom and what they can teach other people, whether because they’ve been incarcerated, because their mom has been, or because they’ve been through war or they’ve been sexually abused, or that, that engaging these pur-, and I really don't mean to be selling this, but engaging critical participatory inquiry with people who have been traumatized. It's what Ignacio Martin-Baró did in El Salvador, it's what Paulo Freire did in Brazil. Um, to just turn it a bit so that we can recognize the wisdom that has been learned for enduring injustice, pain, betrayal, oppression, violence; there is such, we're doing this project with undocumented women who are experiencing domestic violence and can't call the cops, can't get orders of protection, but we're just doing a project on, like, what they know. And it's outstanding. Are they in pain and could we all use a little therapy, absolutely, but, but I just worry that sometimes we turn trauma into pathology and like, there's another one who's broken. Um, my former student and friend, Eve Tuck, who's an indigenous scholar, has, has written a public letter in the Harvard Ed Review, um, to, to her own communities to stop using damage metaphors. Because damage frameworks are, are, kind of, what psychologists have made a living off of. And so, Bill Cross and I taught a course on damage and the way in which damage has become, kind of, our capital for getting what we think of as justice; but I'm not sure it's worked, right? So, I just, just a little caution that when we move in those terrains, um, that we also understand that under the pain and the betrayal lies a ton of wisdom and if we can create a, a cultivating space for understanding the wisdom that lies there; it's not to ignore the pain and the damage, the mother of two C-section boys and a foster kid, I know there is also damage to, for all of us. Um, but also, there's wisdom of, of, of, um, that we need to cultivating. 

02:04:50
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO I just want to say a couple things about the question, uh, about what makes us go, keep going, uh, and it's been echoed already. I mean, it's essential we keep going. I mean, it's passion that keeps me going, it's belief that there is more work to be done, um, and the third thing is I have privilege. And I want to say to everyone in the room y'all have privilege, will all have privilege, which means that we need to harness that privilege through education, through stations in life we've come, through knowledge we've acquired. And, I always say my mantra is ‘you put your privilege to work’. I put my privilege to work and there's so much work to be done in order to create, um, justice, uh, and to move injustice, uh, out of people's lives. So, it's about putting my privilege to work, that's what keeps me going. 

02:05:45
[sil.] 

02:05:45
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS Um, Jess, Jess, that was a great question, um, I, I just want to say that no matter what tribulations you go through and the battles that you fight tow-, for, for justice and all the problems you might encounter and everything, one of the things we're taught in, in our way, in poletcha(ph) way is there is there is happiness deep inside of you always. And you can access that. No matter what is happening in the external world around you, you can access a joy and happiness inside of you. You might have to, um, you might have to go through some rituals to find how to do that, you might a word people hear, mediate, or you might have to do these other things but there's a way to do it and, for the most part, contemporary people have forgot how to access that. But you can, you can access the happiness; it's there, no matter what's going on around ya and that'll help you get through. 

02:06:55
[sil.] 

02:06:55
DR. JANET HELMS Agree with the panel and add that nothing I do really requires much courage. Uh, courage is being willing to go out on the streets when, when you know that people are going to beat you, and hose you, and set their dogs upon you. Um, as far as I know, that's probably not going to happen for anything I do. So, as long as that's the case, um, I'm, I'm willing to take the chances. If someone tells me that there are gonna be dogs and hoses and beatings, I'm not sure I could do that and so, uh, in a sense, what I do is just payment for the people who were willing to do that. 

02:07:40
[sil.] 

02:07:45
DR. MARIE MIVILLE Thank you everyone, Alvin and all our incredible panelists; um, another round of applause, beautiful wisdoms. And so, now we want to take a little risk here and do something we haven't done before. And, um, it's actually inspired by one of my favorite spirituals I grew up with, um, as a child, a song called, uh, ‘This Light of Mine, I'm Gonna Make it Shine’ and Bernice Johnson Reagan talks about how that, that song carried her through the Civil Rights Movement. And it seems simple and it seems like, you know, kind and gentle and so on, but she felt it was such a revolutionary thing to say, this little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine, no matter what. So, I wanted to call, we asked, um, six students to come up on stage and we're gonna ask, um, our, our elders, our, our, what was it? Sexy, hot? And frankly, I don't see hot sexy and elders as necessarily being at odds, but, you know, let's not be ageist. Um, and I've asked them to, to just prepare just a couple of, of things to say and to just pass on that, that light, uh, then to have that light shine in you too. So, I'd like to call up our students. They're, uh, a mix of our doctoral and our master students. Please come up, Georgia, Jess, Jen, Collette, Tiana(ph) and, I'm sorry, I didn’t get your name? Leo? Leo. And I do want to share how important our students are to t his, this, um, conference. Um, here on stage, we have a group of young people that, um, together have devoted many hours to putting this together, all the many, many details. Some of the faces should be very familiar. And then we also have students who are enrolled in a class that I will tell you, keeps the structure of this Roundtable alive. Because every year, when it comes to scheduling we have, we have the say to have these rooms, because why? It's a class. And so, the involvement of our masters students is as important as anything else that we do with the Roundtable and I just want to honor all of your involvements up here and all of you know I know, I know you're here. And so, I want to pass out the candles to our, our elders. 

02:10:25

02:10:40
DR. MARIE MIVILLE And I have one for you too, Alvin. Okay. And I'll just light it, so you people don’t have to worry about it. Okay, um, who, who'd like to go first?

02:11:20
[sil.] 

02:11:20
DR. ROCKEY ROBBINS Okay, um, my pearl of wisdom is very brief. Um, as you guys become leaders and, so-, you know, students out there that become leaders. I'm talking directly to you? Is that right? Oh, okay. On behalf of, okay then I'm gonna tell Georgia, then, this is for everybody to overhear, all right? And I know you’ve already become a leader in so many ways and a, or a facilitator. Um, I want you to always remember that if you two perfectionistic and obsessive as a leader, you'll squeeze all the joy out of the work you do with your career. If you're too proud as a leader, you'll annoy everybody and they won't work with you in a cohesive way. But the important thing is to always remain humble and listen to what everybody says and follow the reasoning, even if you don't under-, even if you don’t agree with it and promote harmony in the group first. That's my, that’s my pearl of wisdom.

[sil.] 

02:12:50
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO En Espanol or Englais? [non-English narration] Um, Jessica, the words that come to mind and just a little encouragement about knowing your past, knowing your family, knowing your familia, [non-English narration], so that you could get here, okay? Knowing what you have to do, not only for yourself, [non-English narration], okay? Part of your obligation and you're going to do that not only through your scholarships, through your accomplishments, but your engagement, [non-English narration]. And as you draw from all of this, um, you're gonna create some new pathways for other people to come along with you, okay? That's part of your, your mission is to create new pathways for other people and, as I said before [non-English narration], you're gonna work multiple pathways. You're gonna be [non-English narration] , many times. So, just remember that and that’s, you're gonna learn from all of those boundary, uh, journeys, okay? And finally, put your privilege to work. 

02:14:20
[sil.] 

02:14:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So, this is Collette. A piece of African wisdom I stylized over time says simply that life that’s best is a creative synthesis of opposites and fruitful harmony. Lot of different meanings, but for you it means that sometimes your greatest strength will also be your greatest weakness. And sometimes your greatest weakness can, in fact, be your greatest strength. Never lose the capacity to believe in the transformative possibilities of the human spirit. And as you continue to find your voice in your training and in your professional growth and development, never, ever allow misery to have the last word.

02:15:50
DR. MICHELLE FINE Um, so, what do I want to, to tell you? I wanted to tell you that, to, um, to find laughter and have really good girlfriends. Have you already done that? 

02:16:15
TIANA Yeah. 

02:16:15
DR. MICHELLE FINE Are they here? Yeah, they're really, really important. Um, I also want to tell you to, to, um, keep voice messages of your mother or grandmother, right? All of you keep those. To have the courage to come here today I had to listen to my mom again and her first voicemail message on my machine is, ‘Hello, I love you, I forget who I called, call me back.’ So keep those, they're so important. Oh, no! 

02:16:50
[sil.] 

02:16:55
DR. MICHELLE FINE I want you to remember that when the light blows out you can turn it back on. I want you to listen to your body because the stressors show up in our bodies. I'm a fainter. I have fainted at conferences. I think, it's really important to pay attention because, um, our bodies are talking to us. And I am, I'm also a, a swimmer and I've almost said in swimming, you know, I think of my body as a metaphor and these people were like, a body is not a metaphor, it's speaking to you. But mostly I want you to remember wherever you come from, wherever that beautiful name comes from, and I'm sure it has a long and beautiful memory, to hold on to those ancestors, because they brought you here. And keep the door open, as you have success, keep the door open for the next generation. Because, um, Reverend Wright in Chicago recently said, the much maligned Reverend White, recently said, ‘ I don’t want any children from Chicago to go to Ivy League colleges because they forget where they came from.’ Right? You can go to an Ivy League college, but never forget where you came from.

DR. JANET HELMS Um, that’s it. 

02:18:45
[sil.] 

02:18:45
DR. JANET HELMS That’s probably my problem. Some, some, some, sometimes I can't make these fine discriminations, candle, microphone. So, my advice to you is to be able to make those, kind of, discriminations, but, not really. Um, my guess is that you are a non-traditionalist and that just your being here, uh, reflects something about you that makes you special and unique in your ancestral history. And so, what I, I would like the message for you to be is to realize what your dreams are, recognize that often people will not understand your dreams and will try to encourage you to go in different directions. Don't be stubborn, take a few steps down the path to see what those directions might hold for you, cause you never know what you can learn from exploring other people’s dreams. But ultimately, as soon as you know who you're supposed to be, then be that person, regardless of what people say to you.

02:20:25
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Leonard? Hi. I'm Alvin. So, let's make sure this doesn’t blow out. Um, you know, as I think about it, I think, what, what, what point are you at in this program? 

02:20:35
LEONARD Uh, masters. 

02:20:35
DR. ALVIN ALVAREZ Masters, okay. Okay, so, you know, I think, one of the things that strikes me as particularly in graduate programs, people are gonna spend a lot of time getting you to think about your career, right. Whether you want to do an academic route, whether you want to do a clinical route, whether you want to go on to get a PhD, whether you want to go on into policy, or research or this, that and the other thing. And so, I think, there's a lot of focus on career decisions and academic decisions. And here's what I want to share with you. What I'd like to share with you is my hope for you is that you actually make decisions about life, not just about your career, right? Cause, I think, when you do that, you're gonna include your brothers, your sister, your partner, your community, cause there's more to you than a psychologist. And there should always be more to you than a psychologist. You're a son, perhaps you'll be a father, perhaps you are a father, perhaps you're a partner, my hope for you is that you integrate all those pieces into yourself, because I think, when you do that, when you approach life as a person and if you approach your career as a person, that’s when your career will take off. So my hope for you is that you hold onto yourself, as everybody else has shared. 

02:22:00

02:22:00
DR. MARIE MIVILLE And so, I've asked Thomas just to, um, say a few words to end this morning and we'll see you, I hope, later this afternoon.

DR. THOMAS PARHAM Let's see if we can't get this group to find somebody to connect to, grab a hand, so something. Just gather round.

02:22:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM What you have just been privileged to bear witness to was ritual. And the importance of ritual is that it helps to center our consciousness on the task at hand. Celebration, particularly 30 year one, are not simply times to look forward to where we're going but a times to take a look back at where we've been so that we never lose what have been the most authentic parts of who we are at the core of our beings. What we do is put on conferences, but who we are at the core of our beings is something that we want to make sure that we hold on to. This is a very special place, a multicultural place, our own cultural comfort zone. And so, as we center our consciousness on the task at hand, we invite us to remember that we are all in this together. And so, we'll invite you to appreciate the symbolism here. Much of what goes misunderstood in our cultural conditions occur because of our inability to understand symbolism. So, we invite all of us to remember that truly in the flow of human development, our multicultural community is a river and we who call ourselves people of humanity are standing deep in its waters. And with amazing grace, we are beginning to recognize the ancient flow of human wisdom, as well as, the indelible marks of human development. The river of our community speaks to and through us. Multicultural family, we must listen to the laughter and the pain and feel the sorrow and the strength of our river. Roundtable family, we are standing in the river. Alone we shall be swept away by its current, but united we can know how many rivers to cross. Individually, we shall drown in its depths, but combined the river shall guide us to the higher ground. Singularly we are halted by its torrid bank, but as one the river shall carry us to a distant place. As one people, the river shall return us to the source. Roundtable family, we are standing in the river, transformed and transforming. And all the village said? I say. 

02:25:25
UNKNOWN I say. 

02:25:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM All the village said? I say. 

02:25:30

02:25:30
