STUART CHEN-HAYES My name is Stuart Chen-Hayes and I am the president of NARACES and it is my great pleasure and honor to welcome Dr. Rita Chi-Ying Chung as our first keynoter. When I considered who I wanted to ask for keynote addresses, I had only two people and both my first choices said yes just like that and when I thought about my own background, my work in mental health and I thought about my interest in equity and social justice and I thought about my commitment to international perspective there is only one name that came to mind and that was of Dr. Chung. Dr. Chung has led an extraordinary life let alone career as a counselor educator and mental health in school counseling advocate all over the world. She has lived on multiple continents, speaks multiple languages, advocates and consults for equity and social justice in multiple places. She along with her husband Fred Bemak are the co-originators of counselors without borders. She has written a book on counseling refugees and she and Fred have a new book that’s about to come out on Social justice counseling as well. Rita has written multiple presentation, delivered multiple presentations, and written multiple articles, book chapters as consulted from multiple groups around the world and is one of the most interesting and powerful speakers that I know and so that any further I do, I am so honored to introduce to you Dr. Rita Chi-Ying Chung, our keynote speaker. 

00:02:05
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Good afternoon everyone. Hi, its good to here and Stuart thank you for that lovely introduction. As again I say it’s a pleasure to be here see some old faces and meet some new people and I look forward to meeting those that I have not yet know. Um, actually I was going to say that being the speaker, that the keynote speaker at the end of the first day of the conference. I really feel I am in a difficult situation and then you know, may be we should have had a little tit or tat and aside here but in a way here I am now in the podium. So it’s kind of look strange if I say, you know talk among yourselves and I’m gonna be, Philip and I had been Stuart and I are going to have a little chat. Let me (inaudible ) counselors I know you can be kind enough and let me tell you about my dilemma. And this is what the dilemma is after a four day of conference I see the energy, I see the excitement and sort of really wanting to go out and party and I am in between you and this wonderful reception. So sorry folks, I’ll try to be as fast as I can. Okay, there is only dilemma number one. Ah yeah, I’m sorry, I do have a lot of dilemmas but I promise I’m not going to spend a whole hour talking about my dilemma, but I do want to share with you dilemma number two, there is a cross cultural dilemma. And I’m sure some of you here will appreciate this. Now, my culture when you begin a presentation you apologize and as you know in the US just (inaudible ) tell a joke. Now compounding this dilemma is I am not good at telling jokes. So I’m struggling about how am I gonna start this presentation. Now, if I tell a bad joke you know, I am gonna have made a loss(ph) of face. Okay, so I think so I put myself I am not gonna do that to myself. I’m… I’m gonna you know walk way sort of my hip between my legs and a poppy would never surface again for who knows when. So I’ve decided to keep with my culture and I am gonna apologize for not telling a joke. So, I assume you get to say, my apology yes. Okay, okay now I got that done with okay. What I hope to do today is talk about counseling and Social justice work.

Social Justice Counselors in Action: Walking the Talk Rita Chi-Ying Chung, Ph.D. George Mason University NARACES Conference New Brunswick, N.J. September 24, 2010 

00:04:15
DR.RITA CHI-YING CHUNG And I know many of you in the room are already doing some social justice work. So may be I’m just preaching to the choir, but unfortunate there are so much social justice issues out there that we as counselors would in schools or in communities or counselor educators need to attend to. So what I want to do is I want to share with yourself of my experiences in terms of working on social justice issue in the US such as the counselor without borders, work that we’ve done after Katrina as well as the wildfires in San Diego and also talk about some of my international work in Asia on child trafficking and also working three months after the earthquake in Haiti. And now, before I begin to talk about my social justice work I really wanted to share with you briefly my social justice journey. I think it’s important for counselors to reflect back about on their journey but that you know, you know when we do social justice work, it’s not always easy and for me when I reflect back on my journey, I kind of get refocus and I sort of get a re-energized, re-motivated for me to continue with my social justice work. I am a child of a refugee parents. Both my parents migrated to New Zealand at the World War II when the Japanese bombed their village. My mother, my grandmother became a confute women and I am not sure whether you know that concept but there is a real nice way to say that, she was forced into prostitution to surface the Japanese. And just like any survivors at the war, they experience some horrific sort of a war situations and they migrated to New Zealand and some of you may know of New Zealand through movies such as the Lord of the Rings, and Wild Rider so you can get a picture. That’s a beautiful country with some incredibly visionary social welfare policy. Not sure whether people know that New Zealand was the first country that gave New Zealand women the (inaudible ) in 1893 which is 25 years before the US, okay it also has incredible social policy such as socialized medicine to sort of in a progressive OH(ph) pension program. But even though New Zealand has social rights and human rights um, it stands out my family and I sort of encountered multiple experiences of racism and discrimination. My dad would tell me that when he first arrived in New Zealand outside the movie theaters was this sign saying “No Dogs or Chinese”. While growing up in New Zealand and you probably wondering who I am in that photo, I am that fashionable conscious young women carrying the handbag, okay. Okay, the other turn would laugh at our Chinese names, but they couldn’t pronounce them and I remember my siblings and I will go home crying and I really insist we want an English name and I insisted harder than anyone else, because I really quite frankly hated my Chinese name which is Chi-Ying and Chi-Ying translated into English is bestowed from heaven courage, okay it might sound quite cool now right? But when you are five, it doesn’t mean a thing. Especially when my sisters had beautiful Chinese name such as snow flaks and fragrance. I mean, you know five years old that’s wonderful. Um, and my father didn’t know much English, he had minimal English and only one thing he knew in terms of the language was really going to western movies. So my name is Rita, I’m after Rita Hayworth. Notice my sort of beautiful, sort of red hair, okay. My sister Elizabeth after Elizabeth Taylor and so on. I still have the memories when I was 14-years-old and a history teacher when she was lecturing about the Japanese invasion to World War II and to China said why do you think the Chinese became yellow, and I for oh oh! This is not going to be a good outcome for me and I kinda shrink in the back thinking, oh please oh no one notice that I’m Asian okay. And then she proudly announced and said the men do not want their women or children to be raped. So they put them in borrows where people urinated and… they became yellow. Oh when the time, when the principal told my family that my sister will not be the valid(ph) Victorian and said we all know that she is the best student but you know what we cant give the status to a Chinese. It for all of these discriminatory experiences my parents and sister that we should treat everyone the way we want to be treated regardless of how they may treat us. Powerfulness and when you are a young child. So from a young age my parents in social justice values and to me and ironically they were reinforced by the New Zealand Social justice stance. My father who passed away only a few months ago was my role model, because he refused to let racism impact and in fact he became a driving force in terms of helping new immigrants into New Zealand and became the (inaudible ) between the Chinese and the New Zealand community. So my social justice lesson and journey began at a young age with combination of my parent’s failures and those of New Zealand. I’m the one in that photo with the arm around my younger sister. I have no idea what I am saying um, but I’m hoping that as the young social justice advocate, I was pointing to my siblings fighting and saying if you gonna fight, well fight fair. Okay. In 1981, I along with many New Zealanders from all walks of life protest against the upcoming South African rugby (inaudible ). Rugby for those of you who don’t know is a national sport. We organize protest for out New Zealand that actually put New Zealand in a economically standstill. We the people were able to pressure the government to break off all ties, all political, financial, economic sports type of South Africa, because of the apartheid policy. Growing up in New Zealand there was a sense that as an individual you can create change and you just speak up about social justice issues and these are the values they have impacted who I am today. So, it’s no surprise that my work focus on cross cultural work on immigrants, refugees and more recently looking at child trafficking issues. I have had the great fortune to be invited to work in Myanmar, well some of you know as Burma looking at child trafficking. Now, human trafficking especially for sexual expectation is not a new phenomenon. You know, it however is increased and changed new dimensions due to globalization. The present volume of trafficking is ten times greater than the transatlantic slave trade. Every… every region in the world is affected by some form of human trafficking. UN has estimated that 700,000 to 2 million women and children are trafficked yearly globally. We start to do the math that it equals to about 2 to 6,000 women and children trafficked on a daily basis. In the US is estimated as 45 to 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually to the US. I’ve been working in Burma and Asia for the past three years on these issues and the stories I hear are incredibly heartbreaking. I’ve met numerous families who have earned only less than a 150 dollars a day and what they do as they accept false office of foreign employment whether to work as a maid or work in a restaurant overseas. Only to be forced into prostitution when they arrive in the country of destination, they work in deplorable conditions. They have to pay off some (inaudible ) day of millions of dollars and their passport and any legal document are taken away from them. Now, due to the level and the degree of consistent and persistent poverty, parents are willing to sell their children as young as 8-years-old. I met a family who sold their 13-year-old into prostitution for a price of a TV. When I spoke to their father, he had no regrets, but the mother wept when she discovered that her daughter was not working in a restaurant whereas the agent has promised. But instead she was work in a brothel serving as many as eight men a day, but her tears were not for her daughter. Instead she said, I should have ask for 10,000 (inaudible ) which is equivalent to about 220 dollars, instead of 5000. The agent robbed us. Now, when you hear these stories you may think these parents are terrible parents. How can you sell your children? But as counselors I thought that we cannot make this kind of judgment, we need to understand the degree of poverty that force parents to have these values and behave in this manner. When you are living in extreme poverty, what choice do you have? Families watch helplessly and hopelessly as their children, as their grandparents died of starvation. 

00:14:05
”Poverty is the worst form of violence” Mahatma Gandhi 

00:14:10
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG As Mahatma Gandhi once said, ‘poverty is the worst form of violence’ and I know all of you have poverty in your community and it fixed the entire community as well as counseling interventions and training. Now, other factors that affect trafficking in a sex industry is the amount for commercial sex and with technology and globalization this has allowed individuals to buy sex have greater access for sex and also technology increases the amount for sexual services and as (inaudible ) on for child prostitution because of the fear and the mess of HIV AIDS. False promises of money and job opportunities pull people into being trafficked. When you are living in poverty and an agent and a broker offers you or your caretaker an opportunity to earn large amount of money and you believe or you expect that if you go to the foreign country and earn this money you would take care of your entire family. This is hard to resist, literally pulls you into being trafficked. Think about how tempting that is. If your child is starving, if you are watching your elders starve. Now cultural obligation and financial contribution to family are also factors into trafficking. And I want to explain this interaction by sharing with you a story of a 10-year-old girl name Ku Ku 

00:15:40
KU KU’S STORY 

00:15:40
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Ku Ku’s story illustrates poverty and… and the cultural aspects of trafficking. When Ku Ku wakes up in the morning, the first thing she does is go to the river and get water for cooking and then she helps her mother cook food for her father, uncles and brothers. She doesn’t go to school, because she is expected to um, to look after her siblings. She has no say or what she does or what she wants. No one ever ask her how does she feel or what she thinks. Now the family is struggling to put food on the table and the man in the family feel her as an asset that can be sold to make a better life for the entire family. The combination of poverty and cultural factors plays girls like Ku Ku at risk to being trafficked. The core value of Asian culture emphasizes family. Children are to be obedient, submissive, respectful. The concept of video piety that is taking care of the parents. So sacrificed for the family for the great and good of the family is a major value for Asian culture. These values create a cultural obligation to financially contribute to the family and in general Asian culture is a male dominated culture. They value boys over girls and hence the preference of sons over daughters. And daughters are viewed as a commodity that can be trade and sold. Let me continue with the story of Ku Ku. Her father and her uncle had been talking about sending her to work as a maid in the country when she turns 11 next month. She is petrified about leaving home, but she is conflicted which you know she has been taught that to be a good daughter you need to contribute to the family. She says nothing as the men discuss her fate. But she knows too well if she should speak she will be severely punished and beaten. Now, try to comfort herself she felt oh may be being a maid is not too bad, because her best friend who is only a year older than her was forced to marry an older man and her neighbor sold a 9-year-old daughter. Now as the men discuss her fate Ku Ku looks to her mother hoping with these tearful and pleading eyes hoping that her mother will intervene. Her mother shamefully looks away remaining silent. Knowing that she has little power to intervene for her daughter’s fate and also know that she will be beaten if she voice her opinion. But a sadness sweeps across her face knowing that for Ku Ku to be a maid she has put her daughter at risk for violence and sexual abuse. She knows it is not whether her child will be raped, but it’s when will she be raped and she is helpless in terms of preventing the situation. The Asian culture socializes children to respect and obey parents and to contribute to the family wellbeing. Girls such as Ku Ku put themselves at risk for the sake of economic improvement for their families. Many of them feel they need to make a sacrifice to benefit the family and therefore living out to the video piety concept of obeying parents, taking care of and supporting parents and helping the family. In some cases, when I’ve actually spoken to trafficking survivors that is girls that are being removed from prostitution, they have mixed reactions. They definitely do not like what they are doing but they also feel they may let their family down, if they should go home and in another situation girls may want to leave prostitution, but they don’t because they haven’t made enough money. I think that (inaudible ) saying catches the concept of video piety and that is re-paying the breast milk. I know that next time I go back to Burma and I return to those villages I am not going to see some of these girls that I have seen year after year, because they would have been trafficked. Human trafficking has become a global industry, you know generating lucrative profits for traffickers and organized crime syndicates. Human trafficking generates the five to seven billion dollars globally and has become the fastest source of profit for organized enterprise around the world. It is one of the most lucrative businesses and it’s considered comparably profitable crime, you know given that the existing penalty are lenient and also compared to the punishment with drugs and arms you also, also view as the disposable cargo. Girls such as Ku Ku put themselves at risk to be trade and sold and re-sold from trafficker to trafficker from brothel to brothel. 

00:21:00
KU KU’S STORY NOT FOR SALE 

00:21:00
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG These girls should not be commodities, items to be sold. Unfortunately there are few counselors working in the area of child and human trafficking we’re no where to be found. Now some of us may be providing services to trafficking survivors, but we should also be proactive and talk leadership roles in the prevention and intervention of child trafficking and a de… dehumanizing of girls who are forced into the sex trade. Now, a number of recommendations of what we can do, not only for child trafficking, but for any type of social justice issue. Whatever your social justice passion, knowledge and skills, counselors need to work in three levels which is the individual systemic and global. Social justice advocacy must be approached from a holistic perspective to be truly affective in creating change and it does show social justice in action. This is we counselors not only talk to talk, but they are walking to talk. My colleague and partner Fred Bemak and I were in Burma working with child rights and child trafficking, when cyclone Nargis hit in May, 2008. Cyclone Nargis is equivalent to a hurricane three or four. Over 150 mile winds that lasted 12 hours equated 12 foot wall, wall of water. And as you can see in the photo, everything was underwater and may be a few of the huts of the… the roofs of the huts are showing. It is the worst natural disaster that hit Asia since the 2004 tsunami. Approximately 140,000 people died and 2.4 million people were affected. Traffickers were there within weeks after cyclone Nargis. Offering a bowl of rice for sex to young girls or offering to take them away to a better life. The non-governmental organization that we’re worked with were able to provide rice and water to a three-storey monastery. This monastery was filled with survivors. But it was heartbreaking, because we only have food and water for the first two floors. You know, I still have these images and a haunting cries of help from people on the third floor begging us… begging us please… please give us food and water, but we couldn’t do anything. We didn’t have any food and water left. So we said to them we’ll be back tomorrow and they said tomorrow will be too late. My child will die and that’s true. We came back the next day and many children and the elderly have died. We were fortunate to travel by UN helicopter to the delta region area that were the most severely hit by cyclone Nargis. The volunteers we’ve worked with in the delta region has lost their family members and all their home.

Nargis Survivors/Volunteers Laputta Irrawaddy Delta 

00:24:15
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG One young man told me about his experience of Nargis. As the, as the waters was coming in, he hold on to his younger sister as tight as tight can be and when the water receded he thought he’s still holding on to the younger sister. He look down and she was gone. He blamed himself for not holding tighter. Yet the same young man is working as a volunteer to locate and protect that place and vulnerable children. Every one in that photo had lost at least one family member hence most of them have lost their entire family. The residency, the strength, the hope, the courage that… the survivors had gave me the strength to continue with the work. Their ability to laugh even in such terrible circumstances was amazing. Their warmth, their welcomeness sharing the little they have was astounding. I felt ashamed to think that I with all my privilege should felt hopeless and hopeless in this situation. They reminded me of the origin of my name, Chi-Ying. She who courageously endures nature’s hardship by harmonizing with her environment. In the US I have the opportunity to work with the, our counselors without borders that Fred Bemak establish. 

00:25:55
Counselors Without Borders http://counselorswithoutborders.org/ Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi, 2005 

00:26:00
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Fred and I took teams of students to Mississippi three months after Katrina and we provide counseling along six sides on along the Mississippi gulf coast. Now students were surprised because it’s three months after Katrina, but it looked as if Katrina had just hit. We heard the endless stories of struggle of loss, of grief. A young boy described Katrina to one of our students as America got ripped out. Within ten days the team provided counseling to approximately 600 survivors. We left Mississippi the day before Thanksgiving. No one wanted to leave, because we all knew the need for counselors was overwhelming. There was so much need and there is still much need. In terms of counseling services as you know, is five years since hurricane Katrina and some of you might have seen Spike Lee’s recent movie, If God is willing and the Creek doesn’t rise and other media coverage on how much there is still need to be done five years after Katrina especially in the low income regions of New Orleans and Mississippi gulf coast. The areas with people have little or no power. So they are so easily forgotten. Each night the teen debrief of the students about the counseling experience. From two and some times four hours there were plenty of tears, but as the powerful experience for all of us. As one student from the counselors without borders team stated, I learn so much about myself as a counselor and a human being as well as the resiliency of the human spirit. The individuals whom I came into contract… contact had lost everything and we’re in enormous amount of pain, but they still has such a strong spirit and a robust sense of community pride. 

00:28:05
San Diego Wildfires November, 2007 School Bus 

00:28:10
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG In November, 07, a counselor without borders team work in collaboration with San Diego State University to provide post effects of counseling after the wildfires in San Diego county. The fire jumped the freeway and destroyed everything in the path. You can see the power of the fire on how it destroyed the school bus in this photo. We work in areas that Red Cross and FEMA were not in, that is the low income ethnic communities. The team provided counseling in the Latino migrant communities as well as the Indian Reservations in tribal schools. Now within a week, the team of 20 provided counseling to approximately 1220 people. In San Diego just like in Katrina we saw a lot of injustices. We saw how the rich La Jolla region, had a massage station in the FEMA facilities, where we were working, there wasn't any resources or minimal resources. We work in the communities and that goes close to the Mexican Border. 

00:29:20
Counselor Without Borders -San Diego Wildfires 

00:29:25
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG The U.S. Border patrol would stop the counselor Without Borders team members who were not white, because they want to ensure that we did not cross over illegally from Mexico to the US and this happened to us daily it was like a ritual. We saw signs in English they said please go to the FEMA side located at your community for resources, but in Spanish it said no water no food here. We heard stories from Latino families who were scared to leave their homes during the fire, because of the border patrol, and they had legal status in this country or families who call for help but no one came. 

00:30:10
Haiti Earthquake, 2010 

00:30:15
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG In April, three months after the earthquake, Counselor Without Border team was invited to work in Haiti. As you remember, approximately 220,000 people died. The earthquake has been rated as one of the top ten deadliest natural disasters in the world, similar to other disasters, we have worked in there was a lot of loss, grief and pain. Every collapsed building we drove by, we knew that there were bodies buried underneath. A lot of debris everywhere have not been cleared, there is no way to put it, so we have piles and piles of debris and rubble, children were looking for their parents. Parents were looking for their children, confusion everywhere. 

00:31:05
Post-Disaster Counseling in Camps 

00:31:10
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG A woman told me about a haunting nightmares that she now has. Once the earthquake began, just like everyone else, there was confusion and all she could think about well she needed to go home, to make sure her children was safe. So she made her way through the streets and she sort to go home, and she saw buildings collapsed in front of her, people being crushed in front of her, those who survived and was buried underneath the rubble cried and begged her to help, she hesitated, she wanted to help, but she knew if she stopped for that one second, she may not be home in time to save her children, so she ignored the crieds, and this is what conso(ph) told today. She asked me did I do the right thing. 

00:32:00
Camps/Living Conditions 

00:32:05
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG We visit camps that house thousands of people with only two bathroom facilities for the whole entire camp, those telling us how afraid they were to go home to the tent camps at night, because the lack of security and the increase now of rape and sexual abuse of girls and children. An 8-year-old girl, told me about what happened during the earthquake, she was in one room and her mother was in another room and when the house shook, she ran to the edge of the room, she saw her mother in the other room and said mom, mom, come over to my side, the mother said no, no, you come over here, it’s safe here, she said no, no, I can't… you need to come over here, she said I couldn't move, I just wanted my mother there. They went back and forth, you come, no you come and in a split second, she saw her mother being crushed as the walls and the ceiling in the room that her mother stood collapsed, and she saw her mother crushed and died. I remember talking to Areal(ph) a 7-year-old girl, who lost her whole entire family, and yet she had this huge smile on her face, and you can even see it in, on the picture she drew for me, everyone is smiling the person who was killed by the earthquake was smiling, the man carrying the child has a smile on his face, the child whose leg is cut off and you see the bit of red that symbolizes the blood is smiling, you don't have to be a counselor to understand what's behind 7-year-old Areal's smile, that's extreme pain, the earthquake only lasted 30 to 40 seconds, and yet there was numerous stories like the one I have just told you and just like Katrina, just now according to the media, Haiti fatigue. People are tired of hearing about Haiti, Oh for goodness sake I’m tired of hearing that. And I think we are to blame to, Oh no not Haiti again, oh just switch stations. We want to move to the next um… disaster. Give us something little bit more sexy something fresh, another disaster that we can go Oh… wow ho… oh my goodness, and just like Katrina, Haiti would take years to rebuild, and we counselors need to be in there throughout the whole process. The need for counselors is enormous, we should be one of the first responders to these disaster, demand for our service is tremendous. Now if disaster and global issues is not what your passion is, that's okay. But there are multiple social justice issues happening in the US, I don't need to tell you about the statistics of homelessness and the personal violence and that the reason education and health care. Unemployment for example and you just need to look at the newspaper or read um… the TV, 9.6 percent that is 14.9 million people highest unemployment since 1948, what year are we 2010, highest unemployment since 1948, one in seven people in the US live in poverty. This is a great country, there is no doubt about that, and what makes it unique is the diversity and yet there are so much intolerance in our society. Recently if you remember, the pastor in Florida wanting to burn the Quran for the 9/11, anniversary. Hate crimes have increased in the US against anyone that looks different. How do we become so fearful of those that look different from us, whether it’s race, ethnicity, immigrants, religion, sexual orientation, disabilities, age, socio-economic status, the list goes on, and on, I can be here all day talking about all day inequities. How do we as a country became so intolerant, is that what we are teaching our children. What are we teaching our children, we know about the educational disparities between the rich and poor children, between white children and children of color. The high school dropout rates were alarming. Did you know that in US every 10 second, a student drops out of school. US the richest country in the world and yet here we are placed 10th in the world for the rates of high school completion. I know when I ask some of the students about seeing their school counselor, who might have the kind of indignant look that rolled your eyes like that, why would we go and see a school counselor? I know you also notice a lot of good school counselors out here, you are doing tremendous amount of work, we need more of you to do that great work, you know we need you to do great way to eliminate these appalling statistics. A high school student once told me about her experience with the school counselor. She went to see the school counselor about just problems that she is having at home. School counselor said to her, I know your family, and you got great parents, you got a great family, you know they look after you financially, you got food on the table, they buys you the latest technology gadget, you know, I don't, I know you’re prominent but it’s not that bad, think over the homeless childrens that we have in the schools, you know, your life isn’t that too bad, you'd be okay. Okay, so now let’s look about TV did you see the just what housewives see today, are you into reality shows, what about loss, those children say to me I will never see a school counselor ever again, and you wonder why, students, clients don't come to see us for help or assistance. Every seven seconds a child is born in the US and yet every 35 second a child is born into poverty, every 36 seconds a child is confirmed abuse or neglect, every 41 seconds a child is born without healthcare coverage and every 80 minutes a child dies before his or her first birthday. How many times have you heard children are our future, children are our future and we've all hear this. Is this what our future looks like, children living in poverty, children who are not educated, children who don't even get a chance because they die before their first birthday. 

00:39:15
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Look at this boy, what he is about nine, ten years old, and he is being processed through the legal system. He is not even tall enough to reach the counter to get fingerprinted. There are 2500 juveniles aged 13 to 17 currently serving life in prison. I don't dispute that they have committed some horrific crimes, but as counselors we know by giving them a life sentence diminishes any sense of hope growth or change, and what is counseling about, it’s about hope, growth and change. And this is against everything that we believe in, in our profession. This is the pathway we are creating for our future. We are living in a quick fixed society, we’d rather punish then educate, sentencing to young people life in prison is ethically and morally wrong. And counselors we must at all cause focus on growth and development, not punishment. US is the richest country in the world, and yet the number of children and youth killed by guns since 1979 will fill 4,177 public classrooms housing 25 students each room. In 2005, just 2005 alone the number of children and youth killed by guns would fill 120 public school classroom of 25 children each. And yet there are no federal safety standards on domestic manufactures of firearms, but we do have at least four federal safety standards for teddy bears. You know, what are they? For sharp edges, points, sharp parts, hazardous material and flammable ability. Teddy bear, they look cute but don't be fooled, because beware did you know that in 2000 to 2004 four models of teddy bears were re-called by the US consumer commission, due to possible, this as possible choking hazard, yet no federal health and safety agency has the authority to recall defective fire-arms or force changes in design. These cute little teddy bears as I said look cute, but never judge a teddy bear by how it looks, killed one child in 2004, compared to guns that killed 29569 people that same year, let me give you those comparison again. Teddy bears cute as they are they can kill, they killed one person in 2004, compared to fire-arms, they killed 29569 people that same year.

U.S. Spending Priorities: • $5.7 million - Domestic Violence • $6 million - Basic Education • $8 million - Cosmetics • $20 million plus - Ice Cream 

00:42:35
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG How did our values shift, we value material goods or the human lives. In the US we have spent approximately 5.7 million in domestic violence and 6 million on basic education. Yet we spend 8 million on cosmetics, 20 million on ice cream. Okay don't get me wrong, I love my ice cream and I am sure all of you but seriously where are our priorities, we spend more on ourselves than to prevent domestic violence and to provide basic health care. How do we as counselors play a role in the injustices how do we contribute to it and more importantly how do we prevent this from happening. As a dear wise friend and colleague the late Reese House once said, how is what you are doing now working? Great question. 

00:43:40
How Is What You Are Doing Now Working? Reese House 

00:43:40
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG How is what you are doing now working? This is the question we need to ask ourselves, that is not working, why are we staying on the same path, I hear this a lot of time, well I know, it's not working, but… but… and but what, it’s not working, why we are staying same path I think we need to learn in the wisdom of what Reese was saying to us and we need to constantly ask that question how is what we do working and is working great, but let’s come up with some new more innovated ideas to make sure that everything we do is successful. Then we talk about the nice counselor syndrome.

How Is What You Are Doing Now Working? Reese House Nice Counselor Syndrome 

00:44:25
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG I was so concerned about counselors being apathetic, they are not attending to social justice issues, that their clients encounter, I (inaudible ) of a concept called a nice counselor, you know the counselor smiles, smile is everyone’s friend doesn't want to rock the boat even though the clients are encountering social injustices, Please I don't want to upset anyone. The counselor that I mentioned before they would rather talk to the students about TV programs, then deal with the real issues. Don't be the nice counselor, you know I am not saying don't be nice, is okay to be nice, but not at the expense of social justice work. We can no longer and should no longer turn our head the other way, and not look directly at the face of injustice. It’s not a pretty picture injustices are never pretty, but we can no longer avoid and pretend that it will kind of workout, or someone will kinda work at it, because I am kinda busy doing scheduling. We are counselors and we are in this profession for a reason, and I hope and I think you all agree that the reason is to fight against injustices and hope empower our clients, our students to fight against injustices rather than help them adapt and accept the injustices. I know this is a cliché now, but I think it’s important for us to ask that question. 

00:45:55
If Not Us.........Then Who? If Not Now......Then When? 

00:45:55
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG If it’s not going to be us, us counselors fighting against injustices, then who? Who is going to do it? And if we don't act now. When are we going to do it? Can we remain silence when we are faced by injustices, can we remain silent, when our clients and our students tell us about the injustices they encounter. 

00:46:20
Silence Becomes a Betrayal Our Lives Begin to End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter Martin Luther King Jr. We must become the change we want to see in the world Mahatma Ghandi 

00:46:20
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG As Martin Luther King Junior once said silence becomes a betrayal and our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. Our lives begin to end, today we become silent about things that matter. Mahatma Gandhi also once said you must become the change we want to see in the world. We are the role models for our clients and for the students that we work with. My name is Chi-Ying bestowed from heaven courage. I don't have any special skills or talents or abilities. I am no different than anyone else. But what all I have is my passion and my commitment to social injustices and human rights violations, I cannot and will not be silenced nor will I let people silence me when that comes to speaking out against injustices. I am honored and truly humbled to work beside doors, the survivors of human rights violations and social injustices, but I am only one person, but I know to get a just all of us, all of the races, partisans(ph) if we work together, we can fight against this injustices am I right? 

00:47:45
Yes. 

00:47:45
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Oh no, that doesn't sound like you are here with me. Oh maybe I am getting older. I've got bad hearing, so if I can this ask again, if we all work together, all together collaboratively we can fight against social injustice, Am I right? 

00:48:00
Yeah. 

00:48:05
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Oh! that's like a Wow that warms my heart, we do not need to fight against these injustices alone, look at everyone in our room, our colleagues, our friends fighting together. 

00:48:15
Thank You! 

00:48:20
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG Thank you for listening to me about my social justice journey and I hope that your social justice journey will provide you with that motivation to do social justice work. Thank you and Thank you, for the work that you are doing. Thank you. I think that's a great-great question, how do you kinda balance your own world view of values, when you are working across culture as well as respect the culture of the group that you are working with? Yes, ya… ya… And I think that's just a great question and I think sometimes when you are working in other communities and other cultures people are really skeptical and mistrust I’m gonna say far foreigners meaning you know, you come from a different culture coming in, because of their fear of imposing our own cultural values and I think when we go in, we have to respect that culture and I think instead of going in with these preconceived ideas that we come here and we are going to create change, we come to help, that's not what we are doing, I notice now what you are plain(ph) we do but too often I see, people with this colonial mentality let us or me come in and help you poor people, that's not what any group wants. There has to be a degree of respect and often when I go into work with um, in different communities or different countries I work with the community. I talk to the spiritual leaders that comment… community leaders, I listen to what they, they want, you know and what is best for them. Because I think it’s difficult for us to take the western models of interventions or varies that we have and then try to push it into another culture. It doesn't work, it’s like pushing a round peg into in terms of a square hole okay, and we have to adapt in terms of what we the skills that we bring with us call to or just culturally appropriate. A lot of times, I am working with the culture I am saying well what about this? And often times I just facilitate, I want to hear from the people what is going to work for, for you, and I can throw in some ideas. I am working on collaboration and partnership, so again it’s not necessarily, Oh! I've got all the answers, I don't have all the answers, I’ve got some skills okay, but I think, it’s also constantly for us before we go in, and sometimes it’s difficult because disaster has happened when it happens, but to know up front about the culture and what are the cultural values, but again that's a great question of we always be mindful that we don't impose our own culture onto other people. Okay. Thank you. Well, that's a beautiful way of saying it, how do you feed your spirit? I have that from student from you. Ah… ha… I promise, I'll call it as personal communication, am… ha...ha...ha... you should be here, okay, I think that was important because as counselors you know doing your day to day work we get burn out, and especially when you are working in post disasters or working in issue such as human trafficking, you need issue social justice issue, you can get burnt out fast, that’s why I always reflect where did I come from? Where is my passion? That’s why I told you my story. But also most important is support and self-care, you know, and the support could be, I mean we got support, I got support in this room for this, yes we’re gonna do it together. That inspired me, that will yes, okay I can do it, okay. Also acknowledge the fact that yeah I’m a big trainer and I need to… need to take some time out. And whatever you like to do and sometimes if you, we can decide there is not much to do, I mean. Um… and yes you can see I got a wacky sense of humor so you know, I… I go round and tell dumb jokes and every one laugh at me and I’m laughing. That social support is very important. Family, friends laughter, humor. Well, what people are to do exercise, yeah. But definitely, we definitely need to feed our spirit, but we need to feed it with healthy food, okay. Because there are other ways in terms of coping and I don’t need to tell you what are the unhealthy ways of coping but a healthy ways. Family, friends, social support, okay. Thank you. Ah... what are we building doing in social… in George Mason University in terms of um… building social justice into our program, okay. It is our program. It’s our core mission, we have changed I mean, I (inaudible ) but I’m doing a little program thing, but since you asked I’ll tell(ph) real short and we can talk more about that later. Feel like a little salesman for salesperson for George Mason, but it’s infuse (inaudible ) program right from our foundations class we actually talk the first class what is social justice? What does it mean? And we fuse it in right into our program. For example, our career class, our students who create counseling attend a community, the domestic violence shelters work with inmates. Our counselors without borders, we took our students down. So there is, um… a lot going on about our program, every course in the program has a social justice action project of some sort, okay. 

00:53:35
DR. RITA CHI-YING CHUNG How do we, how do we mobilize a group of students in a extremely very short period of time? It was easy, I mean, it was easy in a sense that we send an e-mail out to all the students who, who want to go to Katrina or the wildfires, we had hundreds, and we felt Oh boy, how do we select it? No problem, because yes, this is our mission. The students are already doing social justice where we’re just collecting clothes for the homeless or canned goods they are wanting, they want this experience, you know, um… and yeah we’ve seen an e-mail around and they volunteer, and believe or not both for Katrina and also for the wildfires, you know by the time, we said okay we are going literally in two days, and you know it sort of you know the numbers start to go down in terms of logistics who can really leave in two days. And then we don’t do down to like 20. And we all sit in the computer room and we book our tickets at once. The students pay for the money upfront, we haven’t I mean a disaster, so we haven’t prepared for it. Fred Bemak can talk more about that, but believe or not we were able to reimburse our students after we came back, because the university and also private donors have given us money, but the students will pay up upfront, and you know what students are like, I mean you know most students are not wealthy, but they are willing to use that money, because they know that one day can help in two bet, this is an incredible experience and I really hope that all the university programs, counselor educating programs can join in with the counselors of bo… boarders and do something like this. Thank you again. Thank you.
