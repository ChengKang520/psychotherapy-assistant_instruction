Re-conceptualising Transpersonal Counselling 

00:00:00
Tra-ill Dowie and Adam Rock 

00:00:00
PHONEIX INSTITUTE OF AUSTRALIA 

00:00:00
ADAM ROCK  All right. I'm going talk about transpersonal counselling and conceptualize it for you today. My name is Adam, and I want to acknowledge my co-author Tra-ill Dowie. He is a psychotherapist. I'm an academic psychologist. Tra-ill is in South Australia, teaching today, so he couldn’t be here. So fundamentally, what is transpersonal counselling? 

00:00:30
What is Transpersonal Counselling? 

00:00:30
ADAM ROCK Is it akin to Freudian Psychoanalysis? Do we have Freudian head pops in an appropriately phallic shape, given its fixations with eros and to a less extent, thanatos? Is it akin to behaviorism? Are we like -- the wheel is turning, but the hamster is dead? Is it rather existential and/or phenomenological, or is it cognitive? Is it all about mental processes, visual mental imagery, long-term and short-term memory systems, consciousness and so on? 

00:01:10
First Force! 

00:01:10
Freudian Psychoanalysis: 

00:01:10
- concerned with, for 

00:01:10
example, the psychology of 

00:01:10
the unconscious mind 

00:01:10
-Freud’s Interpretation of 

00:01:10
Dreams published in 1900 

00:01:10
-Dominance declining by the 

00:01:10
1930s 

00:01:10
ADAM ROCK I want to start by giving a very brief and incomplete history of western psychology unpacking the four forces of psychology and situating transpersonal psychology and transpersonal counselling within that historical spectrum. So the first force, Freudian Psychoanalysis, now, there's been a proliferation of Freudian consumer products in the marketplace. The infantile obsessions of the marketplace demand Freudian consumer products is a commodity fetishism going on. That may be his fundamental contribution penetrating advanced capital society. We have here the After Therapy Mints and we have a Freud finger puppet with the appropriate chaise lounge, beautifully pictorially illustrated. So, maybe the fundamental contribution of Freud beyond this proliferation of consumer products was or is his attention to the psychology of the unconscious. He got his thinking about the unconscious as an entity though not as a thing like entity, no fallacy of rectification(ph) or misplaced concreteness of Freud. So the interpretation of dreams is maybe his most revered text and that’s when Freudian Psychoanalysis really got going as a fundamental force, but around the 1930s, the power of psychoanalysis as a force started to dissipate. Because he posited the existence of all sorts of entities like the ego the psycho ego -- the ego and super ego I should say, Freudian slip on my part there and they couldn’t be empirically verified. So Freudian concepts were not amenable to scientific inquiry and this was bad for a whole bunch of psychologists who had physics envy, psychologists wanted to have the prestige of the physical sciences like chemistry, biology, physics and so on and you know at best the Freudian Psychoanalysis reduce psychology to a pseudo-science according to many. That just paved the way for the second force which is of course, give me something the second force, is that really bad, the word starts with B, behaviorisms 

00:03:30
Second Force! 

00:03:30
Behaviorism: 

00:03:30
-concerned with the study 

00:03:30
of observable behavior 

00:03:30
not phenomena such as 

00:03:30
mind, consciousness 

00:03:30
-Variants include 

00:03:30
methodogical and 

00:03:30
radical 

00:03:30
-Launched in 1913 and 

00:03:30
dominant from 1920s to 

00:03:30
the mid-1950s 

00:03:30
-In turmoil from 

00:03:30
approximately 1958-68 

00:03:30
ADAM ROCK I wish behaviorism transcended verbal concepts because then I wouldn’t have to speak about it, but unfortunately we can’t pour it into a linguistic vessel. So it's concerned with other quantifiable behavior. Broadly speaking there are two kinds of behaviorism, methodological behaviorism and radical behaviorism. Methodological behaviorists say, hey, man mind, consciousness, mental phenomena may exist, but who cares because it's not appropriate, subject matter for scientific inquiry within the parameters of psychology. The radical behaviorists, not surprisingly, take a more extreme view and say, mind, consciousness, mental phenomena don’t exist, so why are we bothering to discuss this sort of stuff. So, you know, Skinner and Watson(ph), were inexplicably bound with behaviorism at the fundamental level and as you know, it was doing very well for a while but around the 1950s, 1958-68 things started to go bad for behaviorism as a second force. What you imagine that was, and that is not a rhetorical question, any suggestions, what’s wrong with behaviorism fundamentally? It's limited, are you merely a stimulus response machine? Are you an otamatone or do you have things like an imagination, personality trays and dispositions, metacognitive functions. So it’s rather impoverished and reduction is to view at the human organism, not very optimistic. This led, of course, to the emergence of humanistic psychology as the all-important third force. 

00:05:10
Third Force! 

00:05:10
Humanistic psychology 

00:05:10
-Emerged out of a 

00:05:10
growing interest in what 

00:05:10
Maslow (1971) 

00:05:10
referred to as ”the 

00:05:10
farther reaches of 

00:05:10
human nature ” (e.g., 

00:05:10
self-actualisation) 

00:05:10
ADAM ROCK Abraham Maslow was the pioneer of this force, he started his career with an interest in the sexual behavior of monkeys. Somehow, this led him to be interested in the self-actualisation with human organisms. So, self-actualised individuals, those who've reached their credit potential perhaps Beethoven, Gandhi, these sorts of individuals. There is often a heated debate around whether or not Adolf Hitler was self-actualised. A controversial claim, certainly he was not if, quote is like empathy, I considered fundamentally humanistic and not bound out with the notion of self-actualisation. But Maslow didn’t stop there. He said, human beings just aren't mind and body, we're not just of mind and body complex and having a precise spaced on location, there is more to us than that. This paved the way for the all the important fourth force, Transpersonal Psychology. 

00:06:15
Fourth Force! 

00:06:15
Transpersonal Psychology 

00:06:15
Maslow (1968) anticipated the 

00:06:15
development of what came to be known as 

00:06:15
“transpersonal” psychology: 

00:06:15
I should say also that I consider Humanistic, 

00:06:15
Third Force Psychology to be transitional, a 

00:06:15
preparation for a still “higher” Fourth 

00:06:15
Psychology, transpersonal, transhuman, 

00:06:15
centred in the cosmos rather than in 

00:06:15
human needs and interests, going beyond 

00:06:15
humanness, identity, self-actualization and 

00:06:15
the like(p. iii-iv). 

00:06:15
ADAM ROCK So Maslow anticipated the development of the fourth force. He wrote I should say also that I consider humanistic, third force psychology to be transitional, a preparation for a still higher fourth force, transpersonal, transhuman, centered in the cosmos rather than in human needs and the interests, going beyond humanness, identity, self-actualization and the like. So transpersonal, transhuman, centering the cosmos rather than inhuman needs and values, what does that even mean? Let's spend a little bit of time unpacking this notion of the transpersonal. 

00:07:00
Fourth Force Continued! 

00:07:00
Hartelius, Caplan, and Rardin (2007) analysed 160 

00:07:00
definitions and identified three major themes defining 

00:07:00
transpersonal psychology: 

00:07:00
1. Psychology beyond ego(human transcendence) 

00:07:00
2. Integrative/ holistic psychology (psychology of the 

00:07:00
whole person in an intercon-nected world; wholeness), 

00:07:00
and 

00:07:00
3. Psychology of transformation. 

00:07:00
ADAM ROCK So Glenn Hartelius who is the editor of the International Journal of Transpersonal Studies, he and a couple of colleagues performed a study. They looked at 160 rather definitions of the term transpersonal derived from general articles, text books and interviews of pioneers in the field. They took those 160 definitions and performed a thematic analysis to try and identify the comprehensive constituent themes or key definitional elements that constitute the term transpersonal. Their analysis yielded three themes. The first is psychology beyond ego, so this is not ego in the Freudian sense or the mediator between the ego and super ego. Ego is used in this sense to denote once individual self with the precise space time location. So the idea that you are an individual, you have a job, you have a name, you inhabit a precise space time location these sorts of ideas. So transpersonal psychology is about the psychology beyond ego. Human transcendence, transcending our personhood or sense of individuality in altered states of consciousness and I'll discuss that more later. The second theme from the thematic analysis was an integrative, holistic psychology. So this is the psychology of the whole person, mind, body and spirit, but in an interconnected world, not as an isolated entity in the vacuum, but as someone who is part of a life world, natural world, someone within a cultural context. And the third theme was the psychology of transformation. That is state change, moving from altered states -- moving from an ordinary vacant state to an altered state of consciousness using specific state change techniques such as meditation, shamanic journeying hanging out in a sweat lodge, sensory deprivation, lying in a floatation tank, fire walking, hypnosis and so on. So these three themes taken together are held to be the key definitional elements of the term transpersonal psychology, according to Hartelius and his colleagues’ analysis. But we'll unpack some of these themes in more detail as we proceed. 

00:09:25
What is the Transpersonal? (1) 

00:09:25
Transpersonal means beyond 

00:09:25
(or through) the personal 

00:09:25
Includes experience in which 

00:09:25
one’s normal individuals sense 

00:09:25
of self is transcended 

00:09:25
- ‘Religious’ or ‘spiritual’ 

00:09:25
experiences 

00:09:25
- Our concern for other people, 

00:09:25
humankind, life, the planet, or 

00:09:25
nature 

00:09:25
ADAM ROCK So fundamentally, the transpersonal means beyond or through the personal. And it seemed transpersonal psychologists from the UK once said, the transpersonal simply means something more, you are something more than that bag of skin, you are something more than that mind, body complex. That is not your supreme identity. So there are experiences in which one’s normal individual sense of self is transcended, some label these religious or spiritual experiences. But it can be as simple as feeling a deep empathy, for another human being. When you really connect with someone in that space and you feel deep empathy for them, your sense of self falls away, you're self-centered, egoic existence drops off. So our concern for other people humankind, life, the planet or nature might even be considered transpersonal because it is not self-centered or egoic. So again I must stress that transpersonal experience isn't necessarily some sort of lofty mystical experience, it can be as simple as deep empathy. 

00:10:35
What is the transpersonal? (2) 

00:10:35
Two ways to illuminate the 

00:10:35
transpersonal concept: 

00:10:35
1. The lengthy way, involving giving 

00:10:35
many examples of transpersonal 

00:10:35
experience, processes and events: 

00:10:35
- Unitive mystical states 

00:10:35
- Near-death experiences 

00:10:35
- Memories of previous lives 

00:10:35
- Experience of deep connection, 

00:10:35
empathy or merging with others 

00:10:35
ADAM ROCK So the UK transpersonal psychiatrist Michael Daniels says there are two ways to explicate the concept transpersonal. One is what he calls the lengthy way. So cataloging a whole bunch of events or processes held to be transpersonal, unpacking them and getting a sense of what they all have in common. Might be a unitive mystical experience, where an advanced meditative state, one sense of self expands beyond the parameters of his or her physical body out into universe and is absorbed in some sort of metaphysical entity such as God or the Dove or Shunyata et cetera, a near-death experience like consciousness sensibly survives bodily death, might be conceptualize his transpersonal memories of previous lives and again experiences of deep connection, empathy or merging with others. 

00:11:35
What is the transpersonal? (3) 

00:11:35
2. The short way, by (perhaps reluctantly) 

00:11:35
using the ’S’ word. 

00:11:35
Thus, the transpersonal may be said to be 

00:11:35
more or less about the spiritual dimension 

00:11:35
of life, or about human spirituality. 

00:11:35
Common central theme: 

00:11:35
The transpersonal is about the profound 

00:11:35
transformation of our usual egoic, self- 

00:11:35
centred existence to some ultimately 

00:11:35
more satisfying our valuable condition. 

00:11:35
ADAM ROCK Daniels also talks about the short way of elucidating the term transpersonal and that's using what he refers to as the unfortunate ‘S’ word, spiritual. This is of course a very loaded term, has all sorts of sometimes unfortunate connotations. But Daniels says, the transpersonal may be said to be more or less about the spiritual dimension of life, or about human spirituality. Fundamentally, taken together, the transpersonal is about the profound transformation of our usual egoic, self-centered existence to some sort of ultimately more satisfying and more meaningful condition. 

00:12:20
Holism 1 

00:12:20
“Holism 1” - the integration of the individual body-mind-spirit (positive). 

00:12:20
Counterpoint - The shadow aspects body, mind, and spirit are neglected. 

00:12:20
In relation to the body, this implies an acceptance of pain, illness, aging 

00:12:20
and 

00:12:20
death. 

00:12:20
At the level of mind, we need to own and come to terms with amenity, 

00:12:20
depression, jealousy, anger and other seemingly negative emotions, as 

00:12:20
well as 

00:12:20
the rational, analytical and conceptual thinking that is often devalued 

00:12:20
and 

00:12:20
neglected within the new paradigms. 

00:12:20
Spiritually, we need to find a way to acknowledge and reconcile ourselves 

00:12:20
with meaninglessness, tragedy, human weakness and fallibility, loss of faith, 

00:12:20
existential guilt, and the dark might of the soul. 

00:12:20
ADAM ROCK So we saw that the second key definition of the term transpersonal pertain to this idea of holism, okay, the whole person. And the transpersonal and this notion of holism, a holism is inextricably bounded of fundamental levels. So I want to talk about numerous versions of the term holism. Michael Daniels and his team of transpersonal psychologists identified three. They become more comprehensive as we progress. The first you call as holism 1, which simply means the integration of the individual mind, body and spirit, but we focus on the positive aspects of that, joy, love, sexual excitement, tranquility, rapture and so on. And we neglect the shadow aspects notions such as existential angst, guilt, dread and so on. So this is considered complete because of the neglect of the shadow aspect. 

00:13:20
Holism 2 

00:13:20
“Holism 2” – the integration of the individual body-mind- 

00:13:20
spirit (positive and negative). 

00:13:20
Counterpoint: the individual's social, cultural and natural 

00:13:20
worlds are neglected 

00:13:20
ADAM ROCK The second holism is the integration of the individual mind, body, and spirit but the positive and negative aspects. So now, we consider the shadow aspects as well. So the shadow aspects is spirituality such as gnosticism, the shadow aspect of the body such as aches and pains, the shadow aspect of mind such as negative thought forms. But this holism is still not comprehensive. 

00:13:50
Holism 3 

00:13:50
“Holism 3 ” - the integration of the individual body-mind- 

00:13:50
spirit (positive and negative) in the social, cultural and 

00:13:50
natural worlds. 

00:13:50
ADAM ROCK Holism 3 is the integration of the individual mind, body, and spirit, positive and shadow aspects but now within one social, cultural and natural worlds. So situating the individual within a life world rather than treating this in isolated entity floating in a vaccum. All right, this is very much what the transpersonal is about as it's more over the decades. Conceptualizing an entity as mind, body and spirit, positive, negative aspects, situated within an interconnected world. 

00:14:25
Reductionism versus Holism 

00:14:25
ADAM ROCK  So I want to talk a little bit about Reductionism versus Holism. So holism is often creative, intuitive, there's that connection, remember the person in an interconnected world rather than being an isolated entity. It can be organic. In contrast, reductionism is about parts, it's about structure, it's very rational, it's often hierarchical. It can be precise and it can be static. If we think back to the various forces of psychiatry we have considered, we find that Freudian psychoanalysis is reductionistic. It essentially reduces individuals to sex and death instincts, the eros and thanatos, that's what you are, you know, sex and death instincts barely on conscience, 'cause they too gross and icky for you to handle, somehow they bubble up into conscious awareness and affect your cognitions, mental processes, behavioral patterns and. 

00:15:35
More Reductionism! 

00:15:35
* Freudian Psychology tends to 

00:15:35
view psychology mainly 

00:15:35
through a sexual lens, father 

00:15:35
and mother issues, and both 

00:15:35
birth and pre-birth experiences 

00:15:35
* Others look at the issues from 

00:15:35
the point of view of our 

00:15:35
thinking - for example 

00:15:35
cognitive psychology 

00:15:35
* Others view the problem from 

00:15:35
the point of view of the 

00:15:35
emotions - for example 

00:15:35
humanistic psychology 

00:15:35
ADAM ROCK Cognitive psychology, cognition might be defined as the action or faculty of knowing. We are talking about mental phenomena. Cognitive psychology reduces individual to thinking, to thought forms. And the humanistic psychology reduces individual to human values, okay, human needs, these sorts of notions. Transpersonal psychology claims, underline the word, it claims about ten times, claims to be non-reductionistic. And thus in terms of transpersonal therapeutic approaches, it's holistic, again, that is the claim. I want to briefly iterate some of the key contributors to the transpersonal movement. 

00:16:20
Some Key Figures in the Transpersonal Approach (1) 

00:16:20
William James (1842-1910) American founder of 

00:16:20
psychology 

00:16:20
* Interested in understanding the function of 

00:16:20
consciousness 

00:16:20
* Considered human experience to be the 

00:16:20
appropriate subject matter of psychology 

00:16:20
* Believed empiricism should be extended from direct 

00:16:20
sensory observation to include mental states and 

00:16:20
processes. This would enable the scientific study of 

00:16:20
mental states and processes 

00:16:20
* RADICAL!!!!!!!! 

00:16:20
* ...named this radical empiricism 

00:16:20
ADAM ROCK The first is William James in fact coined the term transpersonal. James was what you might call a functionalist, he is very interested in the function of consciousness. What does consciousness do? What are its positive and negative performative functions? He'd not care about the structure of consciousness. So James is of course called a functionalist. He believes that human experience was appropriate subject matter for scientific psychology, so he was in to phenomenology, subjective experience, honoring human experience. And he also wanted to extend empiricism to move beyond, knowledge provided by sensory data, to knowledge provided in a variety of mental states that may deviate from ordinary waking states. So he felt that if he extended empiricism in that way, it would be a radical venture, thus he called it radical empiricism so fundamentally James is all about consciousness. 

00:17:15
Some Key Figures in the Transpersonal Approach (2) 

00:17:15
Carl Jung (1875-1961):psychoanalyst 

00:17:15
The goal of human life is to achieve individuation 

00:17:15
individuation is the process of coming to know, 

00:17:15
giving expression to, and harmonizing the various components of the psyche 

00:17:15
Concerned with the collective unconscious: that 

00:17:15
aspect of the unconscious shared by all 

00:17:15
Its components were termed archetypes: inherited, 

00:17:15
unconscious ideas and images 

00:17:15
ADAM ROCK  And of course, we move to Carl Jung, a one-time colleague of Freuds. Jung was interested in the process of individualization, the notion that as human beings our goal is to harmonize the various components of the psyche, it's endeavored towards integration rather than fragmentation. Of course Jung was interested in the collective unconscious. This idea that there is this shared aspect of the unconscious we can all tap into. 

00:17:50
The Collective Unconscious 

00:17:50
ADAM ROCK And here is one way to pictorially represent the collective unconscious. These individual entities tapping into this over mind of sorts. And that might be conceptualized as the transpersonal experience accessing the archetypal(ph) patterns in the collective unconscious because to do that, you have the shared experience that trends since your usual self-centered egoic experience. 

00:18:15
Some Key Figures in the Transpersonal Approach (3) 

00:18:15
Abraham Maslow(1908-1970) - 

00:18:15
humanistic psychology's leading theorist and 

00:18:15
organizer 

00:18:15
Studied people who were 

00:18:15
self-actualizers 

00:18:15
These people made real - or actualized - 

00:18:15
their human creative powers 

00:18:15
ADAM ROCK  And of course we mentioned Abraham Maslow as a part of humanistic psychology and the guy who saw the movement towards the transpersonal, interested in individuals who self-actualize, interested in a variety altered states of consciousness but not so much in transpersonal states. 

00:18:35
Some Key Figures in the Transpersonal Approach (4) 

00:18:35
Stanislav Grof: psychiatrist(b.1930) 

00:18:35
* In the 1950s and 1960s, Grof pioneered the clinical use 

00:18:35
of LSD 

00:18:35
* Called the LSD experience holotropic, meaning 

00:18:35
orientated towards wholeness ...leads to greater self- 

00:18:35
understanding and psychological healing 

00:18:35
* High doses of LSD facilitate transpersonal experiences 

00:18:35
When LSD use became prohibited, Grof discovered that 

00:18:35
transpersonal experiences could be induced using 

00:18:35
Holotropic Breathwork 

00:18:35
This technique involves lengthy sessions of altered 

00:18:35
breathing combined with loud evocative music and 

00:18:35
body work 

00:18:35
ADAM ROCK  And who has heard of Stanislav Grof? One of the three pioneers of transpersonal psyche beyond William James, Stanislav Grof, Charles Tart and Stan Kripna(ph). Grof's a psychiatrist. He was engaged in one of LSD psychotherapy back in the day. And he found that with sufficiently high dose of LSD one would experience transpersonal phenomena. So when LSD became prohibited, he cast his LSD psychotherapy aside and developed a technique called holotropic breathwork, which he believes that he has not empirically verified any sort of controlled evaluation, he believes mimics phenomenological effects of LSD. So holotropic breathwork is extreme breathing, essentially hyperventilation coupled with loud evocative music and body work such as massage. It’s always a good idea to have your buckets and sponge ready because people often become quite nauseous and vomit. They can speak in tongues and so on. And Stanislav Grof I think is in his 80s now and he has lamented the fact that in his life time he has not seen holotropic breathwork into the main stream. And part of the reason why it hasn't is because it can be a very painful psychotherapeutic procedure. For example, people might be in a holotropic breathwork induced state and extensively remember, if I'm going to see a fetal fluid, and then travelling down the birth canal. And that can be a very painful and difficult experience both psychologically and physically. It's worth noting that the term holotropic means orientation towards wholeness, again, is non-reductionistic ethic. Orientation towards holiness here, and also remember the organization of the individualization harmonizing the various components of the psyche as the goal of the human being, again orientation towards wholeness, non-reductionistic at least so it claims. So the fundamental aspect of transpersonal psychology and thus transpersonal counselling is this notion of consciousness. 

00:20:55
* Consciousness may be defined as 

00:20:55
the awareness of internal and 

00:20:55
external events 

00:20:55
* "the subjective awareness of 

00:20:55
mental events" 

00:20:55
* "When people are conscious, they 

00:20:55
are always conscious of something. 

00:20:55
Consciousness always has an object" 

00:20:55
ADAM ROCK Remember James is the pioneer of all things traspersonal was about, functionalism, what is the function of consciousness. If you peruse the Cognitive Psychology Literature you find that consciousness that is to say the conscious awareness component of consciousness is often defined as an awareness of internal and external events or simply the subjective awareness of mental events. So consciousness is intentional. It has an aboutness. Consciousness is always aware of something so they say in cognitive psych literature. Okay. So when you are consciously aware, you are always consciously aware of something. There is a school of thought called decontextualism, however that argues that there is an event called a pure consciousness event or PCE, which is defined as a wakeful, yet phenomenologically content less or objectless consciousness. In other words, it's all about conscious awareness persists, but there is no object, there is no subject object duality, there is no perceiver and perceived, just absolute subjectivity. There is a book about that called the Pure Consciousness Event, very interesting. So fundamentally, the point in the cognitive psych literature, consciousness always has an object. Now if we move from the definition of consciousness as once awareness of internal and/or external events, that is to say, mental processes and/or objects in the external world, we can see what is to this day, the gold standard definition of the term altered state of consciousness. 

00:22:30
Altered States of Consciousness (1)

Tart(1969) defines an altered 

00:22:30
state of consciousness (ASCs) for 

00:22:30
a given individual as a 

00:22:30
qualitative shift in his pattern of 

00:22:30
mental functioning, that is, he 

00:22:30
feels not just a quantitative shift 

00:22:30
(more or less alert, more or less 

00:22:30
visual imagery, sharper or duller, 

00:22:30
etc), but also that some quality 

00:22:30
or qualities of his mental 

00:22:30
processes are different 

00:22:30
ADAM ROCK  It's defined by Charles Tart in his 1969 edited volume of Altered State Of Consciousness as a qualitative shift in one's pattern of mental functioning. That is he or she feels not just a quantitative shift more or less visual imagery, sharper or duller et cetera, but also that some quality or qualities of his or her mental processes are different. This is obviously with respect to a baseline conviction. Unfortunately for Tart, he does not tell us how many components of mental functioning are present, so for example, if you are referring to visual imagery rationality, positive effect, negative effect, visual control, out of body image, et cetera or is he delimiting in a far more restrictive way to just a few components of mental function that forms some sort of pattern. He also doesn't say how pronounced the cognitive shift has to be deemed in altered state relative to a baseline state. And he also focuses on the notion that it is the pattern of functioning that's important for an altered state rather than the intensity. Later theorists like Singer say(ph) it's the pattern and the intensity combined that add necessary conditions for an altered state to be inferred. So it's a problematic definition, but is a very nebulous area.

Meditation 

00:23:50
* Medicative practices may be divided into a 

00:23:50
crude two-fold typology 

00:23:50
1. One-pointedness: the meditator focuses on 

00:23:50
an object(e.g., the breath, a flower) and 

00:23:50
attempts to eliminate distracting thoughts 

00:23:50
2. Vipassana: the meditator passively observes 

00:23:50
thoughts, bodly sensations, and so on as they 

00:23:50
come into being and pass away 

00:23:50
* What are the subjective effects of 

00:23:50
medication? 

00:23:50
Gifford-May and Thompson(1994) analysed 

00:23:50
first-hand reports of ‘deep’ states of 

00:23:50
medication 

00:23:50
ADAM ROCK  Want to briefly talk about a meditative study that taps into this notion of altered states and hints that the possible therapeutic potential of altered sates of consciousness. So given man Tomson, from the city of Sydney(ph) back in 94 posed a question, what are the subjective effects of meditation or what they refer to as deep states of meditation whatever that means. So they had a bunch of experienced, meditators from various traditions such as in Buddhism and they conducted interviews and performed a phenomenological analysis of the qualitative data that yielded three comprehensive constituent themes. 

00:24:30
Meditation Theme#1 

00:24:30
Transcendence Beyond the Normal Physical and Mental 

00:24:30
Boundaries of the Self 

00:24:30
"Peter", a Zen Buddhist, experienced no-self: 

00:24:30
...in which there is no "I" ... no sense of ego... 

00:24:30
this is just dissolving...there is just the universe 

00:24:30
"Timothy" experienced transcending as: 

00:24:30
...forgetting about my individuality... forgetting 

00:24:30
who I was...in what direction I was going...what 

00:24:30
country I was in. 

00:24:30
ADAM ROCK The first is transcendence beyond the normal physical and mental boundaries of the self, a transpersonal experience moving beyond that normal self-centered egoic existence. Peter, a Zen Buddhist, experienced no-self in which there is no I, no sense of ego, this is just dissolving, there is just the universe. Timothy experienced transcending as forgetting about my individuality, forgetting who I was, in what direction I was going and what country I was in. The second thing was a different sense of reality. 

00:25:05
Meditation Theme #2: 

00:25:05
A Different Sense of Reality 

00:25:05
Numerous participants 

00:25:05
described an altered sense of 

00:25:05
reality in terms of a space 

00:25:05
metaphor. One participant 

00:25:05
experienced a: 

00:25:05
field of awareness that is 

00:25:05
cosmic... there was no sense of 

00:25:05
limitation, there was just 

00:25:05
awareness... endless, 

00:25:05
boundless, oceanic. 

00:25:05
ADAM ROCK  And this is often described in terms of some sort of space metaphor. So one person said there was a field of awareness that is cosmic, there was no sense of limitation, there was just awareness, endless, boundless, oceanic. It’s often called self-expansion when it expands beyond your physical body out in to the external world. It's interesting often in deep meditative states, practitioners report about being in the lowest position looking down and the physical body is no longer there. So when that existential anchor just dissolves, it can be quiet disconcerting for some. 

00:25:45
Meditation Theme #3: 

00:25:45
"Frederick" found that the sate: 

00:25:45
is utterly serene... like an 

00:25:45
absolutely calm ocean. 

00:25:45
"Peter" found: 

00:25:45
A much deeper state [is 

00:25:45
experienced with]... a calming of 

00:25:45
the mind... very calm... the sense 

00:25:45
that you're coming down from 

00:25:45
the surface of the ocean. 

00:25:45
ADAM ROCK  The final theme was positive emotion or affect and this is what hints at the possible therapeutic potential or practices such as mindfulness meditation, which as you know is now really in vogue in the psychotherapeutic and counseling literature. So Frederick found that the state is utterly serene like an absolutely calm ocean. Peter found a much deeper state, is experienced with the calming of the mind, very calm, the sense that you're coming down from the surface of the ocean, in other words, since the ocean is like that mental chatter, the monkey mind, all the cognitive noise, when that dissipates, and when you experience stillness, it can elicit intense positive effect.

Transpersonal Counselling 

00:26:25
Non-reductive 

00:26:25
Considers entire spectrum of 

00:26:25
consciousness 

00:26:25
Psycho-spiritual 

00:26:25
Person-centered 

00:26:25
Phenomenological 

00:26:25
Aetiology, psychological, physical or 

00:26:25
spiritual 

00:26:25
Healing balance, harmony 

00:26:25
ADAM ROCK  So just to wrap up, transpersonal counselling proports to be non-reductionistic, the whole person, mind, body and spirit, positive and negative aspects in an interconnected world. 

00:26:40
Transpersonal Counselling 

00:26:40
Transpersonal counselling looks to your 

00:26:40
whole being and well-being rather than just 

00:26:40
focusing a particular physical, mental or 

00:26:40
emotional state 

00:26:40
Transpersonal therapies work on the 

00:26:40
principle of balancing the systems of the 

00:26:40
body, mind, emotions, etc. 

00:26:40
The body, mind and emotions are 

00:26:40
inherently connected and interdependent 

00:26:40
Consequently, if therapeutic attention is 

00:26:40
given to one, then it must in turn be given 

00:26:40
to all 

00:26:40
ADAM ROCK It's psychospiritual in a sense that there is an interface between psychology and the spirit of dimensions of human existence. It propotes to be person centered or all about honoring human experience. It's phenomenological, that is to say, it's interested in the percipient's subjective experience, we talked about that in relation to the deep states of meditation. The etiology of cause is, may be psychological, physical or spiritual which is consistent with the notion that the whole person is body, mind and spirit. So it’s also worth noting that these components are considered integrated. So if one component influence, they all are. And finally, the goal of transpersonal counselling is held to be healing balance and harmony rather than simply the reduction of symptoms to normal lives. Let's skip the last slide because it reiterates the previous one and I believe we are out of time. So thank you.
