00:00:00
MIKE SIMMONS Hello. My name is Mike Simmons. A couple of months ago, I was making a DVD with Jackie Atkinson called Online Counseling. It was while we were talking about self-care, that she mentioned something called a personal first-aid kit. This was something I had not heard of before and I asked her to say a bit more about it during the program, and a bit more still after the program. It was as a result of those discussions that we find ourselves back in the studio again today, talking about personal first-aid kits. So Jackie, what's it all about? 

00:00:35
JACKIE ATKINSON Well, it's something I came across many years ago, Mike, and initially used for myself as part of my self care, and then I've incorporated it over the years into my work, working with clients, working with groups of students, working with supervisees as well. And, looking after ourselves is one of those things that, as practitioners, is incredibly important. We tend to be taught, many of us when we're young, that looking after ourselves, doing things for ourselves is selfish. I turn that on its head and I say, actually the most generous thing we can do is to look after ourselves because it's only then that we can look after others. 

00:01:25
MIKE SIMMONS Absolutely, yea. 

00:01:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, so personal support is something that we need at lots of times in our week, in our day. So personal first-aid kits are a combination of things in them so that you can use them at any moment. 

00:01:40
MIKE SIMMONS So you're saying we need to take care of ourselves if we're to do a good job of taking care of anyone else. What you're providing here is a way of taking care of ourselves that sounds like it's very immediate. It's always available. 

00:01:55
JACKIE ATKINSON It's always available but it can also be for things that are planned ahead. So it can fit any moment, any occasion, that we suddenly want to look at our self-care or find ourselves in need. 

00:02:10
MIKE SIMMONS So we've got glasses of water and bottles here, so that if we feel a bit thirsty, we've got something to drink. It sounds kind of, on an emotional level, a bit like that. 

00:02:20
JACKIE ATKINSON Yes. It's about practicing for ourselves what we're working with clients and trying to encourage them to do. It's so easy to get wrapped up in our work, whether it be with students, supervisees, counseling clients, and forget to come back into ourselves. So it's about mirroring good practice. Personal first-aid kits can be done on a one-to-one basis as we're going to do today, or you can do them with groups. I used to do them with groups of students. Now they need to be done slightly differently then. Each student would have a large sheet of paper and then you'd have a lot of art materials around. It could be collage stuff, it could be crayons, it can be pastels. It could be paints, they, it's not always quite as easy with paints. But anything that people want. Pencils, charcoal. So then you would sort of talk people through it. 

00:03:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:03:20
JACKIE ATKINSON Something that is usable instantly, something that is usable on your own, something that is usable with other people, something that needs planning for, so that it covers a whole range of moments and times that we might need. 

00:03:40
MIKE SIMMONS And we're going to do that today. 

00:03:45
JACKIE ATKINSON We're going to do that for real today. 

00:03:45
MIKE SIMMONS Is that now? 

00:03:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Any moment now. 

00:03:50
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:03:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Mike, this is going to be something that takes you if you wish into the realms of imagination. It's not something that you are actually going to be able to take hold of. So therefore it can encompass your wildest imaginings as you wish. First of all, what we need to think about is what you would like your personal first-aid kit kept in. What would you like it stored in? And that can be as plain and simple or as gorgeously fanciful as you wish, but it's something that has a feel good factor for you. 

00:04:30
MIKE SIMMONS Oh it's a box. I want to say it's made of steel but that feels quite dull, but I think it, I think probably is a very strong box. Not like a strongbox, like a bank box, but kind of very clear edges not much decoration, and you could easily stand on it, drop it, whatever. It would be very safe. 

00:05:00
JACKIE ATKINSON So something that is really safe, really well contain this first aid kit for you. Not a lot of decoration on it. So that implies there's a little decoration on it. 

00:05:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. 

00:05:10
JACKIE ATKINSON Can you tell me about that? 

00:05:15
MIKE SIMMONS I think there might be more bits, hmm, whatever the metal is, kind of cut out and welded onto it and it's the same color. It's a kind of dark. 

00:05:30
JACKIE ATKINSON Right. You've got the relief. 

00:05:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes that's all you've got, yes. So and that's on the top so it's, I think it's a kind of gun metally gray. 

00:05:35
JACKIE ATKINSON Gun metally gray, but we've got this gorgeous relief. And what sort of pattern is that relief? 

00:05:45
MIKE SIMMONS If I knew what the name was that would help, wouldn't it? It's kind of a bit swirly. It's kind of like, kind of 

00:05:55
JACKIE ATKINSON Sounds lovely. So you've got this, you said very clear edges to the box, so it's very clearly defined but then you've got this beautiful swirly sort of pattern in relief on the top, and you can drop it and it stays safe. You can stand on it if you wish to, get little bit higher in the world, have a look to the horizon a little bit further. 

00:06:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, that feels all right. 

00:06:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay. So now we need to start gently thinking about what you're going to keep in that box. Now what are the sorts of things that you currently do to take care of yourself? 

00:06:40
MIKE SIMMONS I sit by the river. 

00:06:45
JACKIE ATKINSON Sit by the river. 

00:06:45
MIKE SIMMONS I canoe on the river. And strangely, I spend a chunk of time just doing very ordinary physical work outside. Of course I spend too much time, well, I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. 

00:07:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, so this is a sort of antidote to your work of worlds, world of work and your coming outside, so it's outside and you said sit by the river. Now just in your mind, can you think of a particular place you love to sit? 

00:07:25
MIKE SIMMONS Oh yea, yea. 

00:07:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Can you describe it a little for me? 

00:07:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, there's, it's above the river about 12, 14 feet above the river. It's a grassy bank, it's actually man-made. It's a bit of a wall that's holding up the river bank, and it's very secluded and there are willow trees on both sides, but they've been pollarded so it's mostly shoots, willow shoots. And the river bends just at that point so I can look that way or that way right down the river and the sun sets straight over the river, so yea, I can describe it. 

00:08:10
JACKIE ATKINSON Ah yes, I like it, I'm picturing it as you're describing it. So it's, you say it's man-made and there's a wall holding up the bank, and it's also something that's holding you up. 

00:08:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. Yes. 

00:08:25
JACKIE ATKINSON And you've got these willows that go through pollarding and growing and pollarding and growing and that beautiful sunset. 

00:08:30
MIKE SIMMONS There's um, steps coming from higher up down to this sort of platform. And there are hedging shrubs kind of on either side so you kind of go down, like you almost go down a corridor like a, like a narrow staircase but with greenery on both sides, so you're very much tucked away there. 

00:09:00
JACKIE ATKINSON So you're tucked away, which is important getting that sort of solitude. You're by the water which can be incredibly relaxing. You've got the potential of the sunset on the right sort of evenings. And you've got the green. You keep mentioning that word green as you're doing it, it's very important. So what I'd like you to do is just to gather that scene up and just put it in your box, settle it in there. 

00:09:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:09:30
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, so it's in there and you can use that whenever you need it. You can go there when you have the time, the space and wish to. You can draw on that in your mind, so if you need just a few moments just to settle yourself, if the world is getting a bit crazy around you, you can take yourself in your mind to that scene and use it just to ground yourself. The next thing you mentioned to me was the canoe, on the river. 

00:10:10
MIKE SIMMONS That's a more social thing. I don't canoe on my own. And that's usually, we live by a river. We usually either canoe a little chunk of it kind of upstream as far as we can go and then drift down, or from place to place. And it's quite extra ordinary once you get onto the river, how everything stays behind. Yea, it's kind of, the sounds change. The sounds change partly because the river banks kind of give a different kind of resonance I think. But kind of within minutes it's like you're in a different world and that's very lovely. I enjoy that. 

00:11:00
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea, that enormous difference between being beside the water and actually being on it and sort of part of it. And that takes me back to Wind In The Willows. 

00:11:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:11:10
JACKIE ATKINSON Ratty and Mole, there's nothing so nice as just messing about on the water. 

00:11:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, and I think certainly for me, I much prefer it when there is no time scale. 

00:11:30
JACKIE ATKINSON You're not having to rush back in time. 

00:11:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:11:30
JACKIE ATKINSON You can always leave your watch behind. 

00:11:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. So you just kind of leave. 

00:11:35
JACKIE ATKINSON And you go with nature. 

00:11:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. And to some extent you really can do that, I mean you can't absolutely just drift down the river cause you're not going round and round in circles. But you know, you can just let it take you. 

00:11:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Let it happen. 

00:11:50
MIKE SIMMONS And that's very nice. 

00:11:50
JACKIE ATKINSON So you paddle up and then you drift down. And also you said this is something that's social and so your first scene, that scene of sitting by the river, is something that you do on your own and imagine on your own and here's something that sustains you and feeds back into you in the way of doing it with other people so that there's a difference. And they're both very, very important. 

00:12:20
MIKE SIMMONS They're both pretty quiet I would say. 

00:12:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea. Okay, so which part of that do you want to put in your box? 

00:12:35
MIKE SIMMONS The moment of having launched. The moment of transition from being land-based to being water-based. 

00:12:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay. 

00:12:45
MIKE SIMMONS The first minute probably. 

00:12:45
JACKIE ATKINSON That first minute, so you've got the canoe, you've got your paddle, so they need to come into the box. And you've got that sort of, I'm imagining a tilt as it sort of goes in to the water. 

00:13:00
MIKE SIMMONS No, actually not, not usually. 

00:13:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay. 

00:13:05
MIKE SIMMONS It's just, it's, it sat there in the water. 

00:13:05
JACKIE ATKINSON I see, it has to be sat there and you climb into it. 

00:13:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:13:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Right, you're not launching as such. 

00:13:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. No, but yea, that bit. 

00:13:15
JACKIE ATKINSON All right, so pick it up. This is where the imagination is a wonderful thing. And settle it in the box. 

00:13:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, I can do that. 

00:13:30
JACKIE ATKINSON And again something, particularly that first moment, something that if you're needing that little bit of calming, that little bit of taking yourself separate from what's going on somewhere cause you said how it's, it was great to be on the water because you leave everything behind. You can imagine yourself just getting into the canoe and pushing off just to sort of settle a moment or two that might be full of angst. 

00:14:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, but I realize that it's not just about leaving something behind. 

00:14:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay. 

00:14:05
MIKE SIMMONS It's about gaining something at the same time. There is this something there. It's not just oh good, I can't hear the phone ring. It's, it's actually in itself it has quieting 

00:14:15
JACKIE ATKINSON So it's actually a double edge thing, it's got two real benefits. You are leaving the phone behind unless you've taken your mobile with you, you are leaving your computer behind, but you are going to and gaining so much from the, the water, being on the water, being part of nature, flowing and just being. 

00:14:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:14:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Lovely. So we've got those two in the box, this gorgeous gun metal gray box with its swirly pattern. What else do you do at the moment, Mike, that you would like 

00:15:00
MIKE SIMMONS Well, I guess the other thing that I haven't mentioned is, is a place I go to very regularly, like since 1969, so it's been a thread of my life since being a young man. In north Wales, which again, it actually if the riverbank sounds kind of fairly isolated, this is phenomenally isolated. It's a small mountain that I go to and I always spend some time every year there on my own, just miles from anywhere. And that, yea, that's probably the most important place in my life, I think. If I couldn't go to the mountain, that would feel pretty grim. 

00:16:05
JACKIE ATKINSON And this mountain in North Wales, is snowden? 

00:16:10
MIKE SIMMONS No, no, no. It's cooled down a lot. It is a smaller mountain. 

00:16:15
JACKIE ATKINSON It's a smaller mountain. 

00:16:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, and I stay in a small cottage on this mountain. I do some music there, sometimes work there, but essentially it's just miles from anywhere. 

00:16:35
JACKIE ATKINSON Miles from anywhere, it takes you away from everything that you choose to leave behind. You do take music with you sometimes, you do sometimes take work but that's your choice. 

00:16:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:16:45
JACKIE ATKINSON It is an isolated place and I love the way you smiled as you said small cottage, as if something about the smallness of it was really important. 

00:16:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. It's very basic. Very basic. It has electricity but that's it. It doesn't have water. It has the sea. The sea's all around it pretty well. It's around three quarters of it and you look out the door and as long as there's not a thick choking mist, then there's the sea which is just wonderful and again water. 

00:17:30
JACKIE ATKINSON I can see there's this theme for you very much of being near water. It something that's very, very important to you. And the thing, the other thing too of getting away from the hurley burley, getting away from your high tech. Yes, you've got electricity, but you don't have running water. You're getting away from all the sort of technology stuff that takes up so much of your world. 

00:18:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, it's true. That's true. It's just, it's just being there. 

00:18:05
JACKIE ATKINSON So a wonderful place to be. You mentioned quite quietly in that taking music. 

00:18:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, well that's another sort of bit of my life, I suppose. I've been writing music on that mountain since 1969, very different music over the years, but there's always been a theme. It's, it's always been present if I, even if I haven't been writing any, by the very act of not writing any because I've written so much there, so 

00:18:40
JACKIE ATKINSON So you really 

00:18:45
MIKE SIMMONS That's what I do, yea, that's what I do. 

00:18:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea. So when you're there, you're feeling the music that you've written. 

00:18:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, I'm afraid I'm sometimes playing the music I've written as well. 

00:19:00
JACKIE ATKINSON It's curious that you say I'm afraid. 

00:19:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, he goes off into a mountain and listens to his own music. But I do because a lot of what I've written more recently has been much more, well I call it environmental music. It relates to the place and it fits the place. And when I first started writing that kind of music there, I walk about with a Walkman listening to it, thinking oh gosh, yea that, that works. 

00:19:35
JACKIE ATKINSON So as you listen to the music, you're walking the environment you've written about. So you're really, really sort of encompassing it, going into that environment in all ways. Sounds beautiful. 

00:19:45
MIKE SIMMONS Well it works for me, a treat, yea. 

00:19:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea. And this is what's important about first-aid kits, that they work for the person who makes them and it's something that, maybe it's a good idea to mention here, we're putting things in that at any point you can review it and add things to it or you can take things out if they're no longer useful to you. So we have the cottage, we have the music. We have the mountain, we have the sea. So that's four different things, so which one would you like to settle in the box first? 

00:20:25
MIKE SIMMONS Well, rather paradoxically I'm going to put a piece of music in there called Stonehenge, which of course while it was written on the mountain actually it wasn't clearly about the mountain. And I suppose that piece of music was, I need to be wary of the word perfect because I'm not saying it's perfect by anyone else's criteria, but it did exactly what I wanted it to do. And when we were then finally recording it, mixing it in the studio, I remember just sort of holding my breath cause it's about 7 and half minutes long, 8 minutes long, but it was all going to be all right, that I was going to capture it. And having captured it, I mean I suppose of everything I've done with music that's the bit that matters most to me, so I'll put that in there. 

00:21:30
JACKIE ATKINSON Yes, so we've got the Stonehenge piece of music, which as you wrote it, it does exactly what you wanted it to do. It's that sort of everything came together in a perfect way at that moment. 

00:21:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. Yea. 

00:21:45
JACKIE ATKINSON So that's going in the box. Settled in. And the other three, the cottage, the mountain and the sea, which next? 

00:21:55
MIKE SIMMONS Well, I think the cottage and the mountain merge 

00:22:00
JACKIE ATKINSON Fine. 

00:22:00
MIKE SIMMONS So much and it is actually built into the side of the mountain [crosstalk]which is why is sort of damp. 

00:22:10
JACKIE ATKINSON [crosstalk]Oh I see, so It's part of. So no running water but it's damp. 

00:22:15
MIKE SIMMONS Running water down the walls, yea. I think that would be a good one. That would be a good one and just outside the cottage, you know I have a ritual. I have many rituals. If it's a sunny day, then I'll get up as early as makes sense and sit outside the cottage reading and then I can be quite slothful out there so that if it's a sunny day, I'll stay outside and just sort of edge round so that I'm facing the sun and coming out of the cottage door on the right hand side is a, a sort of retaining wall that' s holding back a bit of the mountain and its covered in fern and moss and bits of plant life and I suspect bits of insect life as well. 

00:23:10
JACKIE ATKINSON Of course. 

00:23:10
MIKE SIMMONS And I think that's the bit, I'll have a kind of square of that wall and I'll put that in the box and that can be the cottage and it can be the mountain. 

00:23:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Yes. Something that is there and that square has got so much in it. It's got the plant life, the green again, it's got the insect life moving around in there, and you move around as the sun changes direction and you read. And you said I can be quite slothful there. So you're away from the hustle and bustle and the hurley burley. 

00:23:55
MIKE SIMMONS Oh yea, if it's good weather I can read a book a day, so it's, it's good. 

00:24:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, and again it's something that you go to in your mind whenever you need. To actually get there takes a little bit of panning and that's fine because it's good to have things in a first-aid kit that we plan for and look forward to as well as things that we can do instantly. 

00:24:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. The sea. 

00:24:30
JACKIE ATKINSON The sea, an ever changing. 

00:24:40
MIKE SIMMONS Okay that would be, you come out of this cottage, you walk across this little patch where I usually sit. There must have once been a gate there cause there's a little wall around the cottage. You go around the corner and sea's all there, but when you look round, behind the cottage, there's still the sea back in the sunset. And one of the things about going to the same place for 43 years, and besides you don't go much, you don't go much anywhere else, is you end up taking lots of photographs and I've taken so many photographs of that sunset looking down towards the sea and where is the sky and where is the sea and where does it all fit together. Just extraordinary light. Yea, I think that light, that can go in the box. 

00:25:40
JACKIE ATKINSON The light 

00:25:40
MIKE SIMMONS The light that kind of bounces around the sea and the sky. Yea. 

00:25:45
JACKIE ATKINSON So that sort of light that bounces around, that light that really sort of touches the soul can go in the box. 

00:25:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:25:55
JACKIE ATKINSON You mentioned as you were talking about that, how you have taken many, many photographs of this and I'm just wondering how important your camera is to you. 

00:26:10
MIKE SIMMONS Well I, I go there now and just say well, I've taken that picture, but it's like, and in a way, one of the things I do do, looking at those photos feels a bit like what we're doing now. That I'm looking at that place, a place I know so well that I can feel the grass under my feet right now. 

00:26:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, so looking at the photographs you have taken is an important part of the world. 

00:26:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:26:50
JACKIE ATKINSON All right. So maybe the photographs need to go in the box. 

00:26:50
MIKE SIMMONS They can do that very easy cause they're all on computer so they won't use that much space at all. Just, yea. 

00:27:00
JACKIE ATKINSON So they're settled in the box. 

00:27:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, they're in the box. 

00:27:10
JACKIE ATKINSON So we've got everything at the moment that is in the box except maybe looking at the photographs is outside. The importance of the fresh air to you. 

00:27:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. Yea. 

00:27:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Now is there anything that at those points okay when you don't necessarily want to just imagine those places but you want something to really sustain you inside on some of those foul, wet gray rainy gray November, February days. 

00:27:45
MIKE SIMMONS Oh that's got to be a fire. 

00:27:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Why am I not surprised. 

00:27:50
MIKE SIMMONS Got to be a fire. Oh yea. 

00:28:00
JACKIE ATKINSON Now what are you burning? 

00:28:00
MIKE SIMMONS Oh logs. 

00:28:00
JACKIE ATKINSON Wood fire, so the smell of the wood. 

00:28:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. yea. 

00:28:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Any particular wood for the smell for you? 

00:28:10
MIKE SIMMONS No just wood that I have cut. 

00:28:10
JACKIE ATKINSON So it's wood you've cut. You've gathered, you've cut. 

00:28:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, I've stored, I've hauled to the wood shed. That it's, it's kind of 

00:28:20
JACKIE ATKINSON It's there. And you've laid the fire and you've lit it. What do you light it with? 

00:28:30
MIKE SIMMONS Newspaper 

00:28:30
JACKIE ATKINSON And 

00:28:35
MIKE SIMMONS Twigs. 

00:28:35
JACKIE ATKINSON Twigs. Newspaper, twigs, the logs. And a match or a lighter? 

00:28:40
MIKE SIMMONS Oh whatever. 

00:28:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Whatever. Doesn't matter. 

00:28:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. Yea, it's whatever you can find. But yes, that's important. 

00:28:45
JACKIE ATKINSON So is this an open fire or is this a wood burner 

00:28:50
MIKE SIMMONS It's a wood burner. 

00:28:50
JACKIE ATKINSON It's a wood burner. 

00:28:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. I mean, if I, we're actually talking about a real thing. And we changed the open fire to the wood burner and the wood burner is so much better at keeping you warm. 

00:29:10
JACKIE ATKINSON So you've got, yea. 

00:29:15
MIKE SIMMONS and it glows when, it has glass front and you see the flames and the flames warm you. And yea, it's 

00:29:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Yes, so you've got the flames, you've got the gorgeous warmth that when it's very cold and dank outside and dull, it warms you in so many different ways. Okay, you see this is a magic box. 

00:29:40
MIKE SIMMONS Plenty of room 

00:29:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Plenty of room, as much room as you need. So in, you can put your wood burner, with the logs, with the paper, with the twigs and it can all snuggle in there, ready for when you wish it. 

00:30:00
MIKE SIMMONS That's in there. 

00:30:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Anything else inside? 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:15
MIKE SIMMONS Dave the cat. 

00:30:20
JACKIE ATKINSON Dave the cat. Your expression seems to say to me he may be a character. 

00:30:25
MIKE SIMMONS He's feral, he seems to have been a project of mine for the last year and a half. He now stands outside the house yowling first thing in the morning wanting to come in and be fed. He's very resentful about being turfed out at night. 

00:30:45
JACKIE ATKINSON So a reformed feral cat. 

00:30:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, maybe not quite reformed enough which is why he's turfed out. I get teased about, I think deservedly, about the way I'll bring Dave the cat into the conversation at different times, but I've been fascinated by how his levels of trust have developed. I mean, there's a real Maslow thing going on here, about a hierarchy of needs. And he has sort of domesticated himself I would say. You know, he will scurry into the front door like a domestic cat whereas for many, many months, the door had to be wide open, you had to stand away so that he could run away again if he wanted to. So I, I've kind of, I've treasured this developing relationship with this dribbly cat with the bad breath but is he a beautiful cat? Well he's an okay cat. 

00:31:55
JACKIE ATKINSON What's beauty, it's as if the beauty is in the fact that he's learning to trust and he's domesticating himself and it's as if Dave is his own person and you are there to facilitate and to allow him to grow in his trust. And how that mirrors the world of counseling. 

00:32:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, it's true. That's true, yea. 

00:32:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Yes, and the delight in watching him grow and develop and learn to trust you. 

00:32:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yes, it's been very special. 

00:32:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Well, you see this box again is magic cause Dave can go in there quite safely. 

00:32:45
MIKE SIMMONS I worry about what he'll do in it. 

00:32:50
JACKIE ATKINSON You see in the box again, he won't do anything that is going to mess anything else up, and neither will he suffocate. 

00:33:00
MIKE SIMMONS That's good then, he can go in. 

00:33:00
JACKIE ATKINSON He can go in. 

00:33:05
MIKE SIMMONS He can go in, yea. 

00:33:10
JACKIE ATKINSON So these are all things that feed you in different ways. I'm wondering and it may not be true for you but for so many people, certain things that we either eat or we drink can be oh yes, I'm feeling a bit low, I'll just have a 

00:33:40
MIKE SIMMONS No, I don't think with anywhere near the potency of the things we've talked about. 

00:33:45
JACKIE ATKINSON Fine. 

00:33:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, I don't think so. 

00:33:50
JACKIE ATKINSON And that's fine. I just wanted to check that we weren't missing an angle. One bit I did miss a few minutes ago was that you said you read a lot up at the mountain. So what sort of things 

00:34:05
MIKE SIMMONS Oh rubbish mostly. 

00:34:05
JACKIE ATKINSON Fabulous. Yea, we all need a bit of rubbish in our lives. 

00:34:10
MIKE SIMMONS I can just churn through stuff. I just churn through stuff and I go to the library before I go and judge books by their cover and just grab a load of books, and some I really enjoy and some I don't, and then some are books people have recommended to me, and some of those I enjoy and some I don't. It, but quite a lot, it's about quantity rather than quality I would say. 

00:34:35
JACKIE ATKINSON So my mind has suddenly gone to a sort of slightly muddly heap of books. 

00:34:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. Yea, yea, yea. 

00:34:45
JACKIE ATKINSON I don't know whether you're a neat stacker or you're a 

00:34:50
MIKE SIMMONS Well, that's always the battle when I first get to the cottage, where I'm going to put things. Cause it's so small. But they end up probably on the storage heater which is old, derelict and no longer works or on this incredibly narrow mantelpiece where they will topple if I'm not very careful. I can see them in piles there. 

00:35:10
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, so it sort of almost in, an amorphous pile of books. And I promise Dave won't do anything nasty to them. 

00:35:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay they can go in. 

00:35:25
JACKIE ATKINSON So they can go in. 

00:35:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. 

00:35:30
JACKIE ATKINSON So is there anything else from your sort of current life that you enjoy doing and that helps sustain you and support you? 

00:35:45
MIKE SIMMONS Well obviously my partner. 

00:35:45
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea. 

00:35:45
MIKE SIMMONS You know, the, the, she would be, if there was only going to be one thing in the box, that would be her, who does all those things. 

00:36:00
JACKIE ATKINSON So very important to you, that partnership, incredibly important and beautiful to sort of recognize that and that out of all the things, if there was to be one thing and we don't have to choose one thing in this. It's not desert island disks. So, she can go into the box. Again to be there physically most of the time, lots of the time, but also if you're not with her, the sort of strength you get from that partnership can be reflected on and can be incredibly supportive from a distance. 

00:36:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:36:50
JACKIE ATKINSON So that's your sort of current world and the things that are there that you've remembered at the moment, and anything that comes into your mind as we're talking, you can certainly sort of say, and we'll pop it in. I'd like you to think about 5 years now, 5 years ago, and was there anything that you did or used then that you've lost touch with that you would like to bring back in? 

00:37:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. Actually there was, because I work for myself now, I'm self-employed. And 5 years ago, I was working in a University environment, very challenging, very exciting, really enjoyed the people I worked with. I really enjoyed the kind of minute to minute discussion, banter, and felt a very creative time, and but I would say especially 5 years ago, but time seems to go so fast, but yea, I'd say especially then. So yes, I, I miss that. 

00:38:05
JACKIE ATKINSON So you miss being with a group of people where there's that banter and support. 

00:38:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:38:10
JACKIE ATKINSON And is there anywhere in your current world where you meet up with groups of people that, could or do 

00:38:25
MIKE SIMMONS To some extent, but actually I think it's fairer to say just no. Yes, I work with groups of people, I'm on committees with groups of people, but I think there's something about the day to day contact that is different and I don't have that kind of contact with anyone. 

00:38:45
JACKIE ATKINSON All right, so that's sort of memory bank, and nice to reflect back on. 

00:38:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yes, absolutely. 

00:38:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay. There's a corner for memories in this box. 

00:38:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea, that's sort of nice to have that in there. 

00:38:55
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea, just to reflect back on the people who have meant a lot to you in the past and therefore have contributed in their own ways to who you are now. 

00:39:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, oh yea. Yea. 

00:39:10
JACKIE ATKINSON So that's 5 years ago. Rewind. 10 years ago. 

00:39:25
MIKE SIMMONS See I'd say that my life in many ways was much the same then as it was 5 years ago. 

00:39:30
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay 

00:39:30
MIKE SIMMONS You know, I was still in that world I described and 

00:39:35
JACKIE ATKINSON And there were no hobbies at that point that you were doing that you've lost touch with. 

00:39:40
MIKE SIMMONS No, no. Probably the only, the only difference might be that I was totally part of a team. And very excited about what we were doing. I think if I've got my sums right, that would be 

00:40:05
JACKIE ATKINSON About then 

00:40:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. So the, yes, perhaps what I was describing 5 years ago maybe was at its peak 10 years ago. 

00:40:15
JACKIE ATKINSON 10 years ago. And you've mentioned a number of times that word excitement and it's as if that very important for you to have things that you are doing in your life day by day, week by week, month by month, that do excite you. 

00:40:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, and that's right. 

00:40:35
JACKIE ATKINSON That be that sort of real engagement with things. 

00:40:40
MIKE SIMMONS I think I, I think I need it to feel like it's worth doing. I feel like, let's try, I need what I do to feel like it's worth doing. That's the thing. 

00:40:55
JACKIE ATKINSON On whatever level. 

00:41:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. Yea, and I can remember times of 10 years ago, sort of conversations, where what if we were to do this, you know, and then oh yes, what we could do then, and then that, that was very exciting in the kind of very cliché way I suppose, sort of embarrassing but I suppose I've always tried to do things that would make life better rather than worse so you know, those exciting conversations would always be about that. 

00:41:35
JACKIE ATKINSON Yes. 

00:41:40
MIKE SIMMONS Look this is better. This is good. 

00:41:40
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea, that sort of interaction and oh yes, and yet, and also we.... 

00:41:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yea, yea. 

00:41:50
JACKIE ATKINSON All of that sort of stuff that is exciting, the sort of planning phases of things, and the sort of how should we do it's. This box you know can hold concepts and it feels as if that's very important for you to retain that in your world, that sort of level of excitement and interplay with people and ideas. 

00:42:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yea. 

00:42:20
JACKIE ATKINSON Something that really sort of gets the adrenaline going and fires you up. 

00:42:25
MIKE SIMMONS Into the box. 

00:42:30
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea, there it goes, you see and again, Dave can't touch it. 

00:42:35
MIKE SIMMONS I think you underrate that cat. 

00:42:35
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay. I'll talk to you again sometime later and we'll see. All right now, I'm rewinding the clock a long, long way back now and the sort of things you did as a child that delighted you, and are there any that sort of come to mind that you've lost touch with but actually would be quite nice to do again? 

00:43:00
MIKE SIMMONS Oh, very solitary child. Very easy with my own company. And I think as an adult I'm kind of doing those same things in a way. 

00:43:20
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea, this is what you've been saying all along the way, the sort of, the mountain, the river. 

00:43:25
MIKE SIMMONS I wouldn't mind taking the dog that I had when I was a kid. 

00:43:35
JACKIE ATKINSON So you had a dog as a child. 

00:43:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea, yea. 

00:43:40
JACKIE ATKINSON But you don't have a dog now. 

00:43:40
MIKE SIMMONS No, no I think Dave has rather put a stop to that there. 

00:43:45
JACKIE ATKINSON For a dog, yes. 

00:43:50
MIKE SIMMONS No, but he was, he was important, very important in my life. You know, I turned out to be one of those kids who said to his parents, you know, I'll take it for a walk morning and night, and then proceeded to do that for the next 15 years. 

00:44:05
JACKIE ATKINSON So you weren't one of the typical kids who said I will, I will, I will, and then didn't. 

00:44:10
MIKE SIMMONS I didn't clean my bicycle however. So yea, he, he, his name was Ringo. He was an Alsatian, a big dog, and I suppose I was about 10 or 11 when we had him so 

00:44:30
JACKIE ATKINSON That's a real sort of formative stage of your life when you're sort of working up to and leaving primary school, changing schools. 

00:44:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yep, and so he was still there, he then stayed with my parent when I left home, and died not that long afterwards actually, but so he was very present and you know, a big dog like that, you're aware of. 

00:44:50
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea. 

00:44:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, so I haven't thought about him for a long time. 

00:45:00
JACKIE ATKINSON So the memory of Ringo. 

00:45:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea. 

00:45:05
JACKIE ATKINSON And as we talk, Mike, I've become very aware that for you a lot of things as are really special and are really important are your memories. And some of those memories, you've turned into your music, some of those memories you sort of sit and reflect on and how sustaining they can be. The really good things that don't have to be expensive. They're just sort of that companionship of taking your dog, Ringo, for a walk morning and night. And he was a substantial dog for a young lad who liked quite a solitary existence but was always constant. 

00:45:55
MIKE SIMMONS Absolutely, he was, I mean, I'm sure my dad would've had a different view of it but he was my dog. 

00:46:05
JACKIE ATKINSON He was your dog and this box is your box and this box is your view of it. You're the only one who manages this box. 

00:46:20
MIKE SIMMONS He'll be fine with Dave. 

00:46:25
JACKIE ATKINSON Yea, they may well learn a lot from each other. Is there anything else that you would like to put in the box? 

00:46:35
MIKE SIMMONS Well I can't think of anything now. 

00:46:40
JACKIE ATKINSON And that's fine because as I said, you can put anything else you want to as and when it occurs and you can take anything out if suddenly it doesn't feel as if it fits. So Mike, thank you very much for doing that, and I just wonder how it was for you and if there's anything you'd like to say about doing this. 

00:47:10
MIKE SIMMONS Well, it's a bit odd because I found it very moving, I found it very special, I feel both grateful because I really enjoyed it. I also feel deeply self-indulgent because we're doing it in a studio in front of the cameras. Now one of the things that I said to you when we were talking about this was let's see if we can get someone else to take the role that I've taken because I'd rather be watching it and then talking to you about it than being part of it. And it kind of feels odd, so I'm having a bit of trouble kind of unpicking the film director bit from the person who is doing that and thinking oh gosh, I've done this in front of the camera, it's going to seem really self-indulgent to people. So there's all that, that I'm thinking oh what's it going to be like editing the thing? So, so there are two very distinct 

00:48:20
JACKIE ATKINSON Okay, yea, you're sitting here as two people 

00:48:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, yea 

00:48:25
JACKIE ATKINSON A film director and somebody who's developed their own kit for real, here in the studio, and you said it feel self-indulgent. And isn't that just what self-care needs to be sometimes. 

00:48:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, now, it feels, it feels self-indulgent only for the film maker bit, not for the, not for the person. 

00:48:45
JACKIE ATKINSON All right, so as a person it feels comfortable. 

00:48:45
MIKE SIMMONS Oh yes. 

00:48:50
JACKIE ATKINSON But as the filmmaker there's that bit of you that is saying how is this going to be to edit it? 

00:49:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yea, and almost, well how could this be of interest to anyone? What kind of DVD is this going to be? 

00:49:10
JACKIE ATKINSON Well what we've done, I mean yes, you've developed your kit as a way of demonstrating to others how they might do their own. Their own would be very, very personal. So this is a lot about the technique of either how to guide somebody through developing one or how a person could develop it for themselves. And from that angle, I'd like to say thank you very much for being prepared to sit in that chair and to actually sit there and experience it, and I'd like to say to everybody else, I hope you have fun and enjoyment and benefit from developing first-aid kits, either for yourself or with others. 

00:49:55
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, thank you. 

00:50:00
JACKIE ATKINSON Thank you, Mike.
