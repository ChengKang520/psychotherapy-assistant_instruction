A PROGRAM FOR THE PREVENTION OF SUICIDE AND ALCOHOL ABUSE 

00:00:00
MELANIE NOKES When my brother died, I wanted to do something. So my mom gave me the opportunity to set up a memorial table for him. I took all the things I remembered him really loving and cherishing and I set that up so other people could see that too. You know, it's, uh, helps trigger the memories sometimes.

00:00:25
LAURA NOKES We come to you today to talk about alcohol abuse and suicide because my son committed suicide, and I feel that his suicide was a direct result of alcohol abuse. Uh, prior to his death I had no idea that alcohol could so seriously change people's minds and be such a mind altering drug. And so, um, when I found that out I thought, 'This is a needless death. If we don't do something with the information that I've learned.' So, Sheana and I come and talk to youth groups to give you some information that we've learned, that I learned, and to tell Keith's story. Because we really want you to remember what we have to say. And I think the best way for you to remember it is if we tell you a story. And we don't make it up. You know, it's true. Every word of it. And, um, before we tell the story I just want to run over some information about alcohol and about life in general. Because you don't have to be drunk or out of your mind on drugs in order to commit suicide. My son happened to be. But, they're, they're two separate subjects and yet in my life they're really intertwined.

JULIE LAUDEL I think that everybody, at a time in their life wishes, 'Oh god it would be so much easier if I just weren't alive,' or something. Uh, Keith had said that a couple times and he would write 'Life sucks.' Just at some stressful points in his life and I, I didn't think that it really meant anything. Cuz sometimes I said it. But I would look for those things and put a little more meaning into it.

LAURA NOKES You don't have to be drunk or high on drugs to commit suicide. Suicide can be the result of an inner depression or a great anger that's held within yourself. It can be the result of feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. It can be the result of suffering a lot of pain your life for a long time. There is nothing in this world, nothing, that's worth taking your own life over. Everything that happens to us while we're alive is just a learning experience. We take everything that happens, good and bad, learn from it. Try to repeat the good stuff. Try to figure out how not to repeat the bad stuff. And we go on, and we go on. And that's how life is. Good times come and they pass. Bad times come, and they pass. But you have to wait. You can't give up too soon. It's kind of like the weather here in Colorado, you know. Yesterday it was freezing, snowing, awful, icy, dangerous driving conditions, terrible. Good place to be isolated, because you couldn't get out. Today it's beautiful out. But we had to wait overnight. And we had to go through the dark to get to the light. And that's how life is. And it goes on. Don't quit. It's the only mistake you can make. Just don't quit. Hang in there. Sometimes all you can do is sit and cry. You know, there's no shame in tears. There's no shame in beating the heck out of your pillow because something's hurting you so bad. There's no shame in feeling your feelings. And there's no shame in sharing those feelings and letting other people reach out to you with their caring. Or reaching out to your friend and letting them know that you care. If you every hear anybody say, 'I'm gonna kill myself. I feel like killing myself.' Please, get help for your friend. Because by the time somebody is saying that they can't reach out for themselves anymore. They need you to get them the help that they need. Being a friend is a big responsibility. It's hard. It's really hard. Suicide is an irreversible action. Can't go back, can't take it back. Once it's done, it's done. And I've talked to more than one young person who has, in the middle of an attempted suicide, decided that they really didn't want to go through with it. And thank God, they've survived. But they came that close. Nobody should have to come that close.

PAUL MARTINEZ You can't be, be young and have this idea that you can drive fast and act like an idiot and nothing is gonna happen to you. You know. You can die, and your friends can die. And if you don't pull your friend aside, or, and especially if they're talking about suicide. And talk with their parentsand maybe talk with him and say, 'Let's talk with your parents.' You know. And tell them maybe you want to see a counselor just to be able to talk with someone. You know, and even go with your friend or whatever. But some way or another, bring it to, to maybe some type of professional help. Because if you don't do that, and if you don't you're your friend that next day that he was too drunk and too stupid, or to sit down with your friend when he's talking suicide. Say, 'Let's, let's get you some help. Let's talk with someone.' You know. Get you a professional. Maybe someone that can help you deal with these things. Because if you don't do those things and you feel like you're ratting on your friend or you feel like you're being a, you know, a geek for telling your friend that, you know, 'You drink too much.' Ten years down the line you're not gonna have that friend to tell anything. So if you wanna see your friend, you know, five years from now or the next day or ten years from now you've gotta say something. You've gotta, tha-, if you're a friend. You're not a friend if you're not gonna say anything.

00:07:50
SAM PERGOLA He would not have committed suicide if he hadn't been so drunk. So, so gone. He wouldn't have. I mean granted, he was feeling bad and things weren'g oing the way he liked them to go. But it just wouldn't have happened if he wouldn't have drank so much that night. 

00:08:15
JULIE LAUDEL I think sometimes he drank to, uh, get away from somet things. You know. Um, then he would turn angry sometimes. You know. So, uh, it definitely changed his mood.

LAURA NOKES I have a few notes up on the blackboard. One is, 'If anyone drinks enough, oft-, often enough, long enough they may become an alcoholic. And, um, alcoholism is a disease. It's an incurable disease and it's an incurable condition. Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic. And, um, I hope that that isn't a condition that any of you ever fall into. Because, um, it's hard to be an alcoholic in this day and age. Because we are living in a culture where drinking alcohol is, uh, expected almost. And accepted, certainly, in most places. And there is a lot of pressure on people, uh, to drink even if they don't want to drink. With, um, alcohol abuse, um, you may experience acute alcohol intoxication or someone you're with may experience acute alcohol intoxication. That's a different thing from alcoholism. It can be a one time deal. It can be the first time that you ever drink alcohol in your life, that you abuse alcohol and experience acute alcohol intoxication. When, um, acute alcohol intoxication occurs there are some symptoms to look for. One is, uh, mood swings. One is violence, semiconsciousness or unconsciousness. It's important for you to know those things because alcohol is, uh, a toxic substance and if you drink enough of it at one time you'll die from poisoning. And, um, there are a lot of stories on the boards that I've placed around the room. Newspaper clippings about, uh, people who have had too much to drink and, uh, died of alcohol poisoning. Sometimes at home in their beds where their friends took them and left them because they thought they were doing them a favor instead of leaving them passed out somewhere. When you're with someone who's been drinking and it could be your parents or a relative or a friend or even a stranger, but you know somebody's been drinking and they exhibit any of that kind of behavior; mood swings, violence, semiconsciousness or unconsciousness, those people really need to go to the hospital or to a detox center where they can be monitored by trained medical people who can tell whether they're gonna cross the line into death. It's a terrible thing. There's a story about, uh, a young man who drank too much and, and for thirty hours his friends tried to walk him through alcohol poisoning by keeping him awake and moving. But alcohol poisoning isn't something that you can walk through. And after thirty hours that young man died. Now if his friends loved him enough to walk with him for that long, if they had known I'm sure they loved him enough that they could have taken him to a hospital ad gotten him the help that he needed. If you've been with people who've had so much to drink that they've passed out and you're still alive to laugh about it together, both of you, you're just lucky. Because it's very possible that your friend could be dead. So it's a big responsibility if you hang out with people who drink. Regardless of age. Because people who've ever taken a drink, you know, once they've had a drink they can't take care of themselves anymore. And they need the people who are with them to take care of them. Especially if they drink too much. There is a condition called a-, alcohol induced psychosis, or commonly known as a blackout. That's when a person has had so much to drink that they're actually unconscious but they're still walking and talking. They'll seem sober again. They've gone from a, a progression of just drinking to being drunk and then they get sober again while they're still drinking. They're in a blackout. And those people are really in a dangerous situation, because they have no idea of what they're doing. And when they recover from that situation they will have no memory of what happened during that time. And yet, I our society today being toxically psychotic is not an excuse for any behavior. And some people have been trying to pull that out as a defense in murder cases, and it doesn't work. You still pay the consequences for your behavior when you're in that condition. And yet, you don't even know what you did. It's really kind of sad. You know, you think of somebody's gonna go to jail for a long time for murdering somebody, they would at least remember what they did to get there. And they don't, and they can't. People who are in that condition really need to be monitored by their friends. Stayed with by their friends, with their friends, and not left alone. Not for thirty seconds. They really need to have medical intervention. They really need to have help. And if somebody doesn't help them, if somebody else doesn't help them they can't help themselves. That's our responsibility as friends, is to keep an eye on each other and to make sure that our friends get the kind of help that they need. Certainly my son is paying the ultimate consequence, because I believe that when he committed suicide he was in this state. In a blackout state. And I believe that if he had survived, he'd say, 'I was talking about suicide? Are you kidding? Me?' But his friends didn't know how to take care of him. Didn't know to get him the help that he needed. Didn't know that they had to call for help for him. They knew that he was talking about committing suicide. They didn't believe he could be serious. And he's dead, because nobody called for help. That's the ultimate price.

CHAPTERS IN A LIFE 

00:14:55
MELANIE NOKES I remember one time my friends and I had a couple girlfriends that lived down around the corner, and we used to play softball. And one day my brother, he used to mow the lawn and he mowed a diamond, a softball diamond in the grass for us. So we all could play together in the grass. And it was, you know, he was creative about things. Was fun. 

00:15:25
SAM PERGOLA I remember we went hunting one time, me and your brother. That, that white jeep I had. 

00:15:30
MELANIE NOKES Uh-huh. 

00:15:30
SAM PERGOLA He shoots this goose and it, and it goes down over this barn and he goes and gets it. And brings it back and puts it in the truck, in the back of the jeep. The goose landed in, in cow manure. 

00:15:45
MELANIE NOKES Oh no. 

00:15:45
SAM PERGOLA Oh my god. It smelled so bad, and your brother smelled so bad. We had all the windows down. It was freezing. And it just, the smell would just not go away. He had it all over his hands. And he didn't, he was so excited he shot the bird he was like, 'Yeah, I got it.' Picks it up out of what looks like mud to him. Carries this goose back , puts it in the back truck and me and my dad are like, 'What's that smell?' And he's like, 'Yeah, what is that smell?' Oh god, it was terrible. Ugh. That was funny. 

00:16:15
Sheana Green Keith's friend 

00:16:15
SHEANA GREEN He, um, would fly the remote control airplanes with my husband. And, um, they would spend many hours out there flying those airplanes, or at the hobby shop. And at the time I had a little girl and I think he really liked her. She was just an infant and Keith really liked her. He would always come and play with her. When he would come pick Steve up and they would take her with them on their flying expeditions. Put her in the car seat and just let her watch what, whatever they were doing. 

00:16:55
LAURA NOKES So whatever happened to this guy? Well, as Keith was growing up he had a lifetime friend named Paul. And they went all through elementary school and high school together. And when they finished high school, Paul went into the marines and Keith went to college. Well part of Paul's marine duty was to go to the Persian Gulf War. We worried a lot about Paul while he was gone. People were losing their lives there, or threatened to lose their lives there. And Paul didn't write to us very much. He just, he just wasn't a letter writer. So we worried a lot. And then one day in June, out of the clear blue, the phone rang and it was Paul. Keith was standing right next to me when the phone rang. And I said, 'Keith it's Paul, and he wants to talk to you.' And Keith's face just lit up like the sun. He was so happy. And, uh, these guys got together right away and started planning Paul's welcome home party. It was gonna be the biggest party that they'd ever had. They both liked to party, they're very social guys. Biggest party they ever had, invited everybody they ever knew. Saturday night at Paul's house, three blocks from us. And I remember Keith getting ready to go to the party, he was so wired, so excited to go to this great party. He had on his new black leather jacket and his red and black striped t-shirt that Julie gave him. And his designer jeans and a pair of old running shoes with fluorescent green on them that he never tied. Every hair in place. Glued, you know. And he looked wonderful, and he was excited. And I said, 'Keith, come and eat before you go to the party. You can't go to the party on an empty stomach.' But he was really excited and he only ate a little bit, and then off he went. When he got to the party, Paul's mom was still home and she was getting refreshments for this party. And, and Keith asked her to bring home some orange Kool-aid, because he really liked orange Kool-aid. I would never let him have it at home because I don't think Kool-aid is good for you. And he loved orange Kool-aid so he was gonna have orange Kool-aid. But while Paul's mom was gone to get the orange Kool-aid, someone showed up at the party with a keg of Coors Light. Coors Light, the silver bullet. And Keith said, 'Oh, I like Coors Light. I think I'll have one. And then when it's time to drive home, I'll be okay by then.' But it was a really wonderful party, and everybody was having a blast and they were doing all this drinking and having so much fun. And finally, Keith, you know, got drunk cuz he kept on drinking. Cuz when he drank he forgot that he wasn't gonna drink, so he drank more. And he got drunk. That's what happens when you drink. You get drunk. And about three o'clock in the morning they decided, or Keith decided that he would see how many beers in a row he could slam. So he slammed between five and eight pints of beer. His friends don't remember exactly how many. Cuz his friends really didn't care how much beer he had to drink. And then after he finished slamming that many beers on top of already being drunk, he continued to drink with his friend Harvey. Because by this time it was just Keith and Harvey. They were making it an all-nighter because they were going to be the alarm clock for everybody to go jet skiing the next morning at five. The plan was they would call everyone at five and wake them up so they could get out to the lake by six to go jet skiing. They were gonna use every minute while Paul was home on leave. And Harvey related to me how it went. 'We were sitting at a table playing cards, and laughing about how people would react when we really did call them up at five o'clock. And you know Mrs. Nokes, it was really the weirdest thing. Cuz we were sitting there laughing and having a good time, right? And then all of a sudden out of the clear blue, Keith says to me, 'What's the best way to kill yourself?' And I said, everything I knew to convince him not to do that. I used all the psychology I learned in high school. I ta-, must have talked to him for a half hour, but nothing I said made any sense to him. Nothing he said made any sense to me. And finally, he said to me, 'I'm gonna go home and get my gun, drive up in the mountains and shoot myself.' And I said, 'Oh Keith, you're so drunk. I'm gonna take you home.' And I knocked that last beer right out of his hand. Yes I did, Mrs. Nokes. You know, it was really weird, Mrs. Nokes, it was like he was so drunk he was sober again. But before I could take him home, I had to go to the bathroom. And he left while I was in the bathroom.' Well I know what happened, cuz Keith came home just like he said he would. I happened to be up cuz my dog had to go out at four fifteen in the morning or so. And I was letting the dog in and there is my son. So I opened the door for him and I said, 'Well, hi Keith.' 'Hi mom.' Like if he inhaled while he talked to me I wouldn't smell the alcohol on him. But he reeked. He walked by me straight as an arrow and went to the top of the stairs to go down to his room. He said, 'Goodnight mom.' I said, 'Goodnight Keith.' And downstairs he went. I thought he went to bed, so I went back to bed. And I thought, 'Oh, I'll give him a lecture on drunk driving in the morning when he's got a hangover. I'll make a big impression.' Meanwhile, back at the party, Harvey came out of the bathroom. And he says, 'Keith's gone, he's drunk, he's driving. I'd better do something about this. I'll get Paul.' Paul is stone cold sober Because it's been Paul's choice all of his life not to drink. That's his choice. So he's stone cold sober. Harvey runs to get Paul. 'Paul, paul. Get up. Keith's driving drunk. We've gotta go find him, he's talking crazy.' So Paul hauled himself, his girlfriend and Harvey into, into his car, and they drove over to our house. Three blocks. And Paul's girlfriend told me that at least twice between Paul's and our house, Harvey told them plain and clear, 'Keith said he's going to kill himself.' At least twice. 'Keith said he's going to kill himself.' When they got to our house, Paul saw Keith's car at the top of our driveway. So he decided to check on his best friend and make sure he wasn't passed out in his car. So he snuck up our driveway so softly even our dog didn't hear him, and he checked on his best friend. And he left. He didn't come to the door. He left. I asked him later, you know, 'How come you didn't come and tell me what was going on?' 'I didn't wanna make trouble. I didn't wanna get Keith in trouble, I thought you'd be really mad if you knew he was out drinking. And I didn't wanna wake you up and make you mad.' And they left. Never said a word. 'He's home, he'll be safe now. He'll sleep it off.' While that was happening, Keith was in our basement where the gun case is getting out his favorite shotgun and some shells and writing us a little suicide note. 'Mom, dad, Melanie, Julie, and all my friends. I'm sorry, my time to go. 

00:25:35
Mom, dad, Melanie, Julie + all my friends, I'm sorry, my time to go. 

00:25:40

00:25:40
LAURA NOKES I heard the door at the top of the stairs down to his room open and close really softly. And I thought, 'Oh good, he came to get something to eat.' But then I heard the front door open and close really softly. I ran downstairs, opened up that door. 'Keith, where you going?' 'Paul's.' 'Well you're walking, aren't you?' 'Yup.' He's walking away from me and it was still dark, no lights, no glasses. Couldn't see the gun. And I watched him walk over to his car. And I said, 'Oh, that rascal.' And I ran up to my husband. 'Ron, Ron. Come quick, Keith's gonna drive drunk. You've gotta stop him.' And my husband said, 'What do you expect me to do about it? If he's gonna drive drunk, he's gonna drive drunk. Just hope he gets to where he's going in one piece.' I ran downstairs just in time to see Keith's headlights going down the driveway. Keith did exactly what he said he was going to do. He did exactly what he told his friend he was going to do. He came home, he got his gun, he drove up in the mountains. Drove about an hour up into the mountains. On those really windy roads. He hit something with his car. Totaled his car. He was not hurt in that accident. There was not a bruise on his body. No torn clothing. Nothing from that accident. But he got to where he was going and he pulled off the road and he drove around and made little donuts. One way, and then the other. Tight little circles. I wonder what he was thinking about while he did that. I wondered if he was playing the stereo really loud. I wondered if they were playing Take me Down to Paradise City. Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty. 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:45
LAURA NOKES I wondered if he was saying, 'I'm gonna drive this dumb old car into the ground before I die.' I wondered if he was saying, 'Jeez, I wish my friends would hurry up and come up here and stop me. But nobody came. So he stopped making donuts after awhile, and he got out of the car, got the gun. He walked west into a housing development. Turned around, walked back past his car, over the two lane highway, through a marshy area, through two barbed wire fences, and up this really steep heavily wooded mountain. And he got to where he was going in one piece. He got to where he was going in one piece in spite of all of that. Didn't even have dirt on his shoes, or mud on his jeans. No tears, no bruises, no scratches. Nothing. Got there in one piece. It was about eight o'clock in the morning on Sunday. And the undersheriff up there says it was a beautiful, beautiful spring morning. And the sun was coming out. It would have just been coming up over the mountain to the east of where he was. So there in this very quiet, serene, beautiful, peaceful place, he shot the gun. He shot it three times. Twice into the air, and on the third time he turned it on his heart. And he shot himself in the heart.

LAURA NOKES The coroner told me that he died instantly. So I wondered, how long is an instant? How long is an instant? And some time later I read an article said an instant is ten seconds. The difference between life and death is ten seconds. And I wondered how long must ten seconds be when you're lying on the ground with your life running out of you. I wondered, what did he think for ten seconds? Did he think, 'I'm sorry, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.' Did he think, 'Now I've got you, you son of a bitch.' What did he think for ten seconds? When it was too late, and he couldn't change his mind.

00:31:35
Gilpin County, Colorado 

00:31:35
SHEANA GREEN Sunday night, Julie called me. Keith's girlfriend. And she wants to know what went so wrong, so deadly wrong at the party. And then she's screaming at me hysterically and she's crying. And I'm like, 'What do you mean? What are you talking about?' And she said, 'Keith started talking suicide last night at the party. He's missing, the, a gun is missing, and a suicide note has been found.' And I was like, 'Well, I left him at two thirty and he was fine. When was the last time somebody saw him?' And she said, 'About four thirty.' In two hours, what could have happened in two hours in Keith's life for him to be so happy and looking forward to jet skiing the next day, to wanting to die? The next morning around noon, a little before lunch, Julie calls me. They found his car up in Gilpin County, and she wants to know if we'll go on a search party. Sure, no problem. When we got there, the search dogs were out. Even though it was raining and they weren't able to pick up a scent, they were attempting to. So we at least knew in what direction he went. They were giving us rules while the search dogs were out. Rule number one, keep somebody in view on either side of you at all times. If you see Keith, and he's alive and he has the weapon do not approach him. Not only do you need to look directly in front of you, but you need to be looking under bushes, up in trees, in holes, any place where animals can hide things. He's been up there long enough, and if he died as soon as he went up there animals could have gotten him by now. If you find him, and he's dead, don't look at him, don't touch him. Turn around and call for help. So we started out on the side of the road where they found his car in the housing development. They didn't think he was there, but we needed to make sure. I had Julie coming to me, and she would start to cry and she would collapse in front of me. And all I kept telling her was, 'Thank good god,' and 'We're gonna find him. Alive.' We crossed the highway, there was a flat plateau and I crossed a barbed wire fence and then went down a hill. And then another barbed wire fence, I sank up to my knees in marsh. And at this point, I got mad. And I got really mad at Keith and if I found him I was gonna kick his butt all the way back down to Denver. I continued. Across another barbed wire fence, went over a dirt road, crossed another barbed wire fence. And I'm starting to think, 'Keith's not up here. There's no way.' But when you're in that state of mind, when you're in that alcohol induced psychosis you can overcome anything to get what you want. About halfway up the mountain I stopped. I had this feeling of, 'It's over.' Either way, it's done. And I looked over to my right, and I saw this baby aspen tree. The sun just seemed to be shining on that tree, and only that tree. But I couldn't see the bottom of the tree. And as I stared at it, I heard a man's voice saying, 'No, no, no.' And that little tree was just shaking and everybody started yelling, 'Down the mountain, down the mountain.' I became really confused at this point. I saw Steve. Like yeah, here he comes running by me, I tried to stop him. And he said, 'I gotta see him. I gotta see him.' I said, 'Yeah.' And off he went. And then I looked again, ah, Paul, he'll help me, right? Big marine. He collapsed to his knees and he started to cry. A little while later, Steve came back. He said two words. 'He's dead.' And then he sat down next to us.

RON NOKES Dedicated to Keith. The facts of life, according to his dad. Keith, you rewrote the future, but nobody can take away the fond thoughts I have of you. Not now, not ever. I always loved you. You were one of the biggest joys in my life. And I want to thank you for that. More than you will ever know. I will never forget you. Let us talk baseball for a minute. From eight, to eighteen those were the years as a pitcher and a third baseman, you had the right stuff. You made the batters look like beginners. You were a pleasure to watch as you practiced your craft. You were major league in my book. Son, the pleasures and companionship you had with me and our friends during the hunting and fishing trips were genuine. You bridged the generation gap easily. How about that ten pound northern pike you had displayed on your bedroom wall from the Canadian fishing trip? Deep down, you must have known that your mother was having it mounted for a Christmas gift. You were everyone's kind of young man. You had it all. You were thoughtful, courageous, truthful. All those types of things besides being handsome and smart. How could a father not be proud and honored by such a son? I do not have to boast. You made it so easy. All I have to do is give the facts. And those who knew you understand everything I say is true. Keith, I want to thank you for helping me to grow in more ways than I thought were possible. Goodbye Keith, I will never forget you. And I will always cherish all my wonderful memories of you.
