00:00:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi! My name is Matt Englar-Carlson and our featured guest expert today is Dr. Katherine Helm. Welcome! 

00:00:30
CATHERINE Hi Matt! 

00:00:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I wanna start by asking you about, what is your approach to counseling? 

00:00:40
Katherine M. Helm, PhD 

00:00:40
Department of Psychology, Lewis University 

00:00:40
KATHERINE M. HELM My approach to counseling so, I'd like think umm… hopefully that I approach uh… counseling with an attitude of respect. 

00:00:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh! 

00:00:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… with curiosity, I use umm… a multicultural lens because I really feel that sort of every interaction that I have with the client is inherently multicultural so I acknowledge kind of differences and how they impact the relationship. But, one of my goals are sort of and kind of how I do, what I do is to umm… really understand clients. I really want them to feel like I get a sense of who they are? I want them to get a sense of who I am? So they can see, if it's a good match and I try to do this in the first session. Umm… and I really want to emotionally connect with the client because, that's an, an important way in, that I work with clients. 

00:01:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what are you hoping to accomplish then, in your work? 

00:01:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… you know, I'm kind of greedy, umm… everything. Uh… really what I'm looking to accomplish is, I want the client to feel understood like she gets me. I don't have to explain absolutely everything to her. Umm… I want clients to feel validated and empowered umm… you know, to do that I think, for, for me as a counselor, I need to kind of understand uh… the context that the client lives in. So, where they developmentally umm… you know, where do they live? And when I say that, what I really mean is kind of, how do they process things? Uh… are they an emotional processor or a coordinate processor? Umm… it's really important for me to really understand kind of, where my client lives because that helps me tailor my approach uh… to individual client. So, you know, what am I hoping to accomplish, I'm really hoping to develop a collaborative relationship with clients where they get uh… out of counseling, what they want and often what they need and sometimes those things are the same. 

00:02:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, correct. So, if the counseling is effective, what do you wanna see happen then? 

00:02:40
KATHERINE M. HELM If the counseling is effective with clients, what I really wanna see happen is, I want them to feel empowered to make changes in their lives, if that's what they're looking to do. Umm… really, I wanna create kind of a safe non judgmental space, where they can process the thing that they came to counseling for what, why are they in pain or what are they struggling with? So, that's really what I'm hoping to accomplish. 

00:03:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like if it's effective, the client will understand kind of, what they really wanna get out of the process. 

00:03:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, that's what I'm hoping for. 

00:03:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, do you follow any particular theoretical model? 

00:03:15
KATHERINE M. HELM I do, uh… I always find this question interesting… 

00:03:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yes. 

00:03:20
KATHERINE M. HELM …Because my students you know what, I'm sure your students do too. Constantly kind of ask that question. 

00:03:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:03:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… so anybody who does uh… counseling for any period of time understands really that all of us uh… in some ways are collective but, I am purposefully and thoughtfully a collectively and when I, when I say that, what I really mean is, I'm really gonna do what works for my client so, you know, remember a little while ago, I was sort of talking about where the client lives? Right, if, if I'm working with the clients and he lives in a more cognitive realm umm… CBT, uh… Cognitive Behavioral Therapy might be the best approach for that client. You know, and I use theory in a couple different ways, really umm… I use theory to help me understand who my client is and the influences uh… on sort of how they came here. 

00:04:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:04:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… I sort of draw from psychodynamic theory, because I really feel that umm… our past sometimes influences us uh… both consciously and unconsciously. Umm… I also draw from family systems because, you know, our families have a significant influence on, whom we become? Uh… whether we want that to be the case or not? Umm… I also sort of look to a motion focus therapy and the inner personal process approach because, I believe that therapy and counseling can really provide a corrective relational and emotional experience and so those are the things that I use to kind of, umm… those are, that's kind of my therapeutic lens… 

00:04:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure are. 

00:04:50
KATHERINE M. HELM …if you will, but I really say that I'm theoretically flexible. 

00:04:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like you're pretty clacktic(ph) in terms of really using what is, what is best for the client. 

00:05:00
KATHERINE M. HELM I try to be. 

00:05:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So you run the reins with theories so I must've kind of wondering then, what is it like to be in the rim of you then? You know, what is your approach then? What are client gonna see from you? 

00:05:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… in some ways I think, that's a great question because, I, I really umm… it's important for me to bring my genuine itself. Right, so, who are they gonna see? They're really gonna see me, my, my reactions to things umm… I do counseling from an emotional, connected place with my client and so you know, if a client is experiencing something, sometimes I'm experiencing that with the clients and I challenge our sort of channel rather, what I'm feeling uh… went appropriate into my interventions with client so, I'm, I'm giving example. 

00:05:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, good. 

00:05:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… so if a client comes in and the clients says, ‘oh my goodness'. I got engaged, right. You know if I'm like, oh, that's, that's great. 

00:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON All right. 

00:05:55
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, who is that? You know, so, if a client is excited about something, I'm often excited along with them and that makes in some ways the relationship genuine because that's what I am. I react to things and I think sometimes we teach students that they can't be themselves umm… that they're not supposed to react or supposed to kind of pair at things or students some how get that impression and, and I don't do counseling like that at all. 

00:06:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know it sounds like, in a way, you kind of mirror what the clients are actually, but you really bring a lot of yourself and natural parts of you that are a healer and natural parts of you that are, actually connect with people. 

00:06:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I like that. You said that. 

00:06:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:06:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, I hope so. 

00:06:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. So you can tell a bit about your background, in terms of how you learnt the skills of being a professional counselor? 

00:06:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh… sure. Umm… you know, I'll start with a kind of a little narrative about my dad. 

00:06:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:06:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh… my father, really influenced umm… kind of my career path. So, you know, he was a school counselor and a teacher and a principal and then you know, he went back to school and became a counselor in a private practice along with many other uh… counselors at the time and he would come home and he would tell me stories and I got hooked you know, I got hooked and you know, I haven't looked back since, but you know, the way that he would sort of talk to me about you know, he would say for example you know, umm… let's say you have a client I guess, he was already projecting what I would do but let's say, you have a client and she's 40 and she just got a divorce and he would say, tell me the rest of the story and so I would sort of come up with you know, what I thought the client's you know, went through in her life uh… to get to this point or what she might be experiencing and really I don't even know if he knew this but he was in gauging my clinical(ph) gut if you will umm… and sort of uh… kind of helping the seventh grader develop conceptualization skills and so I think that that had a very powerful umm… impact me. Umm… obviously I went to college, I was a student at the University of Illinois in Champaign the psychology major. I got a chance to be a counseling center paraprofessional the resident advisor you know, dealing with kind of various crises and then when I left college umm… you know, applying for graduate school was too overwhelming that you, first year so, I worked uh… as a mental health counselor on an adolescent inpatient unit during the day so I got a chance to deal with people throwing things at my head and cursing me out and I found it fascinating. Umm… and I also worked as a receptionist uh… in a private practice at night. Umm… so I got a chance to see what it looked like in the real world. 

00:08:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:08:35
KATHERINE M. HELM And again, I was still hooked. So, then I did decide to go on to graduate school. I was a graduate student in Southern Illinois University in Carbondale uh… and got my doctorate in counseling psychology and at the time, that I was a graduate student, I was teaching and also doing counseling umm… and so that really has shaped uh… my path today, that's what I do. I am the… program director for a clinical mental health program and then I also do counseling kind of on the side in a, on another universe accounting center. 

00:09:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, it sounds like your dad was a really strong influence in terms of kind of hoping that ability to be curious about people and kind of the whole story… 

00:09:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Very much so… 

00:09:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, and then again he's an educator and a counselor. 

00:09:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:09:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And you're an educator and a counselor. 

00:09:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, and you know, the funny thing about that is, I thought teaching is ridiculous like there's no way. Both my parents want to do this, so I don't want to do this but just like kind of the field of counseling, I fell in love with teaching and it never felt right to me to kind of separate the two. 

00:09:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:09:35
KATHERINE M. HELM So, I'm really lucky to be in a career that I get a chance to sort of uh… write and do counseling and uh… teach and so, one of the very cool things I think about what I do is that students are constantly asking me why do you do that? And what are you doing and why are you doing? And is it supposed to look like that? So I really have to kind of think about why am I doing this. 

00:09:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:09:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… it really allows me to kind of have to really self reflect and break down what I'm doing which in some ways I think makes me a better counselor. 

00:10:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure, it sounds again, that's but natural curiosity your students are picking up on you that it's okay to ask questions, okay to kind of wonder, kind of wise or things happening that way. 

00:10:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:10:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, you do train counselors, I'm wondering what are the most important areas umm… in that training that you think are really important? 

00:10:25
KATHERINE M. HELM So, I think that it's important. Umm… obviously I want my students to get basic counseling skills… 

00:10:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:10:30
KATHERINE M. HELM … and to be able to build a solid relationships with clients that goes without saying practice counseling ethically all that. 

00:10:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:10:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… have good conceptualization skills and good diagnostic skills. But what I do, I think that might be different than what other people do at least in my supervision of students, I encourage them to bring who they are into the counseling process. 

00:10:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:10:55
KATHERINE M. HELM I say, why does a client connect with you? You know, so for you Matt like, why does a client connect with you versus connecting with me? You know, that's not necessarily based on skill, it's based on in some ways who we are and I think that who we are is a very powerful tool in counseling so I, that's what I want students to learn to do. Yes you can be professional but you can react to things your client is telling you but, how do you bring yourself into the process of counseling in a genuine way where you make a connection with the client. 

00:11:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, it sounds like you want to help kind of students recognize kind of what part of them and maybe is, is naturally healing… 

00:11:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:11:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …Naturally connects with people so, really you're looking, recognizing their strengths and… 

00:11:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Very much self, absolutely. 

00:11:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …and again the idea that not all counselors are the same. We're not, we're not cookie… 

00:11:40
KATHERINE M. HELM That's right. 

00:11:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …always right, every person is unique. 

00:11:40
KATHERINE M. HELM That's right. 

00:11:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:11:45
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, and kind of here's a funny story so sometimes we interview umm… future practicum students and I get you know, we kind of choose good people and they do great work and we see all these kind of personalities in the interview and then I listen to the first set of tapes, I'm like, where did you go? Right, who is this person? You know, and I say, I don't want that person you know, I want the person that umm… I connected to in the interview and so I really do want students to learn to be themselves umm… in the role of a professional counselor. 

00:12:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. Could I mean, again it kind of goes back to that building our connections and, and that relationship as the core for what we do. 

00:12:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh-huh. 

00:12:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then from that change can, can kind of follow. 

00:12:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:12:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Which brings us to our program today umm… we know that counseling is a process and in this program we're featuring the fourth stage which is. Creating Change. 

00:12:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:12:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So this is a big question, why do you consider change? 

00:12:40
KATHERINE M. HELM That's a great question. Umm… you know, and in some ways a tricky question because I don't think it's easily umm… quantifiable. Umm… so sometimes change for a client can just mean coming in your door. Uh… can mean doing something different, I've seen uh… clients make huge changes in one session and then get stuck you know, and the next client comes in and doesn't make any changes so change can occur emotionally, umm… change can occur in behavior or in the way a client begins to see a situation umm… and so really it's not up to me, to kind of define change for the client it's really up to the client to define change for himself or herself. Umm… not all clients come to counseling looking for change, umm… some do and then you know, I hope my role is to collaborate with them on how that we can do that together. 

00:13:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, you know, at that point that, and not all clients come to counseling looking for change. 

00:13:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:13:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you explain that a bit more, what do you mean by that? 

00:13:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, you know, sometimes clients are coming to emotionally process something that hurt them you know, is that change? It could be you know, but they're not necessarily looking to make a change in their life they're looking sometimes to kind of process what's going on inside of them. Umm… so you know, sometimes you know, for example if a client comes in and wants to quit smoking, well, that's one type of change. 

00:14:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:14:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… a behavioral change which in some ways is actually easier to quantify. A motional changes or not or psychological changes aren't always as easy to quantify. 

00:14:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, sounds like a, there are some instances in which a client comes in and just needs to speak their truth… 

00:14:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:14:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …and needs to say something what they need is to have that witnessed. 

00:14:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:14:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:14:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, or maybe you know like you said, kind of just be heard or understood, validated. 

00:14:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I heard you say earlier that you know, you're necessarily focus on thoughts or feelings or actions or behaviors as being the key to this stage, umm… it's really again my hunch is kind of being true to your nature which is, it's really I guess, what the client kind of need to use all those things are necessary or, or none of them. 

00:14:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I mean, if a client is looking to sort of change to specific thing, I think that you know, we can collaborate together to do that but you know I don't think it's necessarily in my role to kind of tell them what they need to change. Umm… you know, there is a kind of the trance theoretical model for change umm… and it has five stages and I think that's helpful, I mean the stages are sort of pre-contemplation which is sort of before you think about making a change… 

00:15:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:15:15
KATHERINE M. HELM …contemplation which is when you're like, ‘hmm, I think I might need to change something', you know, for example maybe I'm drinking a little bit too much. Action where a client begins to kind of actually put things in place and actually begins to make a change and maintenance where they sort of maintain that change over time and then termination when they're sort of, they made an active lifestyle change in the changes per minute and I think that's a good model to kind of help counselors and clients as well evaluate where they are you know, they may think yes, I'm ready to make a change and you know you may sort of be working with them as a counselor and realize you know that's where they would like to be, that's not necessarily where they are. 

00:15:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. So from that model I mean, each one of those stages actually means there is movement happening, right. 

00:16:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Could be, could be you know, sometimes it means there's movement happening or sometimes it means they're stuck at a point. 

00:16:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right, right. So, when you think about kind of, kind of creating change, than what are some of the keys to success? 

00:16:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Keys to Success for the counselor or keys to success for the client? 

00:16:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good point, right, right, I mean, maybe both. 

00:16:25
KATHERINE M. HELM For the counselor, I think it is umm… you have to come from a place of empathy and understanding umm… and you can't be as the counselor, can't be too over or under invested in the client's change like, so I'll give you an example of a mistake I would make as a kind of younger counselor in the field. 

00:16:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:16:45
KATHERINE M. HELM So if a… client came to me umm… and said, ‘look, I'm trying to get out of this relationship, um… it's bad and this is why I've come to counseling'. I was like, okay, this is what we're gonna do. We're going to try to get you out of this relationship and that's what we would work on and you know you work and you work and you work with the client, you realize nothing is happening umm… and you think you know, what's going on here… 

00:17:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:17:05
KATHERINE M. HELM …You want to get out of this relationship and you're not and sometimes then, I would find the clients would drop out of counseling with me and it occurred to me umm… that I set up this situation where the client has to come in and tell me week after week that they haven't made this change and it I set up a situation where the client might be embarrassed or ashamed or maybe even angry uh… sort of setting myself of up as Judge… 

00:17:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:17:35
KATHERINE M. HELM …and I realize this is not my change, this is not a good situation, not something I should be doing and so I learned to sort of back away off that and say to a client, this is what you're saying. You know, you want to make this change but if you don't, let's just talk about kind of what's going on with you and I think that really, that mistake help me understand how to do it better, how to let the client be in charge of their own change and not me. 

00:18:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like you know, where it's kind of moving the process of Change again back to the client that they, they own it. 

00:18:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:18:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then what you're also doing is conveying empathy then for whether they want or don't want to or how much they want or don't want to kind of the reality is empathy just for what ever they are. 

00:18:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I think that's an excellent way of saying, yes. 

00:18:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so how do you decide what methods to use with, with what client? I mean, there's a variety of pretty techniques and ideas you have in your tool box that you've learned over the years. How do you know what to use when? 

00:18:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… that's a great question. Uh… sometimes you don't. Umm… but I think it goes back to sort of what is my, my goal as a counselor in the first session and it is really to understand who my client is? You know, um… his or her identity the things that are important to them, their values and you know, remember earlier, I was talking about kind of where the client lives in terms of how they process things and so I use that information umm… to help me sort of tailor what I'm doing uh… to my specific client. 

00:19:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, I mean, I'm really hearing you talk about a very client centered approach again in which you have techniques and these tools at your disposal but you really use them when… when it's appropriate for what the client actually wants to do. Yeah, yeah, uh… great, so we have an idea again of kind of what it's like uh… to be with you in the room, it sounds like what's happening in your head and then just a moment in a chance, just to see you in action. 

00:19:30
KATHERINE M. HELM That sounds good. 

00:19:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

00:19:40
Assessment Strategies 

00:19:40
Pairing Stopping Something with Starting Something 

00:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In a moment we're going to see a skill called pairing stopping something with starting something. Katherine, what exactly is that? 

00:19:55
KATHERINE M. HELM So, pairing stopping something umm… for example, a client might come in and want to stop doing a particular behavior that might be harmful to them Matt. With maybe starting something new so, if you take something away umm… even if that something is dysfunctional, you almost have to replace it with something. 

00:20:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:20:15
KATHERINE M. HELM So that the client is less likely to fall back into sort of negative patterns. 

00:20:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like to me, where clients wanna come in and they wanna stop doing something, they wanna, they wanna extinguish a behavior… 

00:20:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:20:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …and this is a technique in which you want to kind of stop that one replaced with something kind of healthy or, or, or pro-social, pro-active in some way. 

00:20:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, sure. 

00:20:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you describe that process and what that looks like? 

00:20:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. So, one way of doing that is to kind of process with the client where they are with wanting to stop a particular behavior or kind of negative emotion or you know, that kind of thing umm… and then to sort of solicit ideas from the client perhaps, on what they'd like to replace that with. 

00:21:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So something like, there's an assessment here an understanding a kind of what client would like to change but also really making sure the kind of what you're placing with is something that the client also wants. 

00:21:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:21:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Okay, okay, so when exactly what accounts or use a technique like this? 

00:21:15
KATHERINE M. HELM I find it helpful to use with clients when they've clearly identified, something that they want to stop doing. 

00:21:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:21:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… you know, they're not sort of just thinking about it, they're pretty clear, I don't want to do this anymore, it's harmful to me, uh, it hurts me in some way and so I think that is kind of a set up for helping them figure out how to extinguish that particular thing and pairing it with something that's more healthy, something that will kind of help them to sort of get out of doing this negative or harmful thing. 

00:21:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in some ways it sounds like, this is an, an action kind of, strategy but you would… you could use it towards they're gaining at counseling when the client is really identified what, what that thing they wanted to, wanted to change is um… but that's also when you could kind of carry with you throughout the whole process. 

00:22:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I would have definitely agreed with that. 

00:22:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, and just a while, we're going to see a clip with you and Karen, I wonder if you can set up this clip. 

00:22:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, so… Karen is coming in because she is just gotten out of a relationship umm… and her pattern has been to kind of hurry up and get into a new relationship and in the session uh… we explore kind of, how to stop that behavior that she wants to stop and how to kind of replace it with something else like kind of, developing new friendships or joining a social group. 

00:22:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is there anything take care that that our viewers should look for? 

00:22:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I think what viewer should look for in this clip is how I solicit the client's agreement umm… and how I assess umm… that this behavior something she clearly wants to stop. 

00:22:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so before you kind of get to the action. 

00:22:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:22:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right before you get to get the new thing, you want to make sure that the clients are actually willing and ready to do that. 

00:23:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:23:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good, all right. 

00:23:05
KATHERINE M. HELM How is your week Karen? 

00:23:05
KAREN It was difficult umm… I found myself really wanting to… call David umm… and just talk to him. Umm… I just found myself you know, crying a lot and it was just hard, and it was a hard week. 

00:23:25
KATHERINE M. HELM How did you deal with wanting to call him? 

00:23:30
KAREN Well we've, we've done a lot of work here and I don't want to throw that all away. So I really have found myself just talking myself out of it. Umm… just understanding that I don't want to fall into that same pattern of behavior of being in a emotionally abusive relationship. I, I really want to have more than that and so I've, I've just had to talk myself out of it and… 

00:23:55
KATHERINE M. HELM You've done a lot of hard work this week. 

00:23:55
KAREN I feel like so, I mean, I feel like I accomplished something by not doing that so… it makes me feel good, it makes me feel good I can come here and tell you that. 

00:24:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh-huh. And I, I certainly appreciate your telling me that, how you've been dealing with the loneliness? 

00:24:10
KAREN It's been really hard, umm… it's been really hard. I, I've have been watching a lot of TV I've just been trying to keep my mind off things… 

00:24:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Kind of distract yourself. 

00:24:25
KAREN Yeah, just staying busy umm… but it's hard, I mean, it's very difficult. 

00:24:30
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, you and I over the last couple of weeks have talked a lot about you know, kind of your relationship pattern where you're with someone for a while and then you know something happens in the relationship where you break up and then you get back on sort of online dating sites or you look to kind of date someone new. We've talked a lot about sort of ways of not doing that because when you're in pain, it's really difficult to kind of make good decisions. How would you like to try something new? 

00:24:55
KAREN I'll try anything new at this point. 

00:25:00
KATHERINE M. HELM What would it be like for you, instead of kind of jumping back into online dating or looking to meet somebody romantically, what would it be like to join a meet up group instead do something social? What kind of… 

00:25:15
KAREN Umm… I guess, I had never thought of doing something like that before. Umm… I mean that sounds, that sounds like it might, it might be helpful… 

00:25:25
KATHERINE M. HELM You seem reluctant, tell me about that. 

00:25:25
KAREN Well, no, I think you would be good in the sense that it would really distract me and it would, it would get my mind off things. Umm… that would be really beneficial. I'm just also wondering if you know, am I going to be sort of sad like, I just don't know, friends can kind of take that same place as maybe a, a boyfriend. I don't know, if it'll feel the same. 

00:25:50
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, I think that's a good point and, and neither of us know if, if it'll feel the same or even how it would feel. Tell me about sort of some of your reluctance in, in trying this new thing. 

00:26:00
KAREN Well I guess, first, I just would be nervous meeting new people that I don't even, you know, I don't know. Umm… that might be the first sort of hurdle, umm… but also just you know, feeling like you know, I'm feel, when I'm with a boyfriend or with I'm with my ex you know, it was like, it was a one on one. 

00:26:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:26:25
KAREN It was you know, affection and it was like emotional you know, we've, I felt secure and I just, I'm, I'm reluctant to, that'll, those needs will be mated with a group of people even if I am enjoying myself and you know, and doing something fun. 

00:26:40
KATHERINE M. HELM So, on a scale of one to ten, how willing might you be to, to give this a try. 

00:26:45
KAREN Well, I think maybe a seven because… 

00:26:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

00:26:50
KAREN Yeah, because I, I do, I don't want to just you know be a recluse and not be out in the world and doing stuff, I don't, I don't want to end up like that. 

00:26:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:27:00
KAREN I do want to get my mind off of this and so I really will try anything at this point because it's just been really difficult so… 

00:27:05
KATHERINE M. HELM A seven is, is pretty high. 

00:27:10
KAREN Yeah, I mean, I, like I said you know I'm, I'm reluctant in some aspects but I'm, I just, I'm tired of like, crying every night you know, I'm just I don't want to do that and I will try anything at this point to kind of try to get over this person so… 

00:27:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Let's go back just for a second, umm… so you're grieving the loss of the relationship which is, is pretty normal. I don't, I don't hear any hesitancy that you wish you would not have broken up with him. 

00:27:40
KAREN Right. Well, after all the things that we've talked about and you've, you've brought to my attention that you know, I deserve more than that kind of relationship just because I am a good person. You know, I, I don't want I don't want to go back to him even though it's painful and you know I'm going through this transition. I, I don't want to fall back into that pattern. 

00:28:00
KATHERINE M. HELM And you may miss the relationship. 

00:28:00
KAREN Right. 

00:28:05
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, but I'm not hearing for sure that it is him you may. Although maybe some of that's in there. 

00:28:05
KAREN Right, you know I think, it's just the comfort of having a boyfriend and somebody who loves you and you know, takes care of you to some extent you know and it's just, knowing you can call somebody at any, any hour of the day. I think, that's what I'm missing that like a sense of security. 

00:28:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, or connection maybe. 

00:28:25
KAREN Yeah. 

00:28:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:28:25
KAREN Yeah. 

00:28:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, so let me explain, explain a little bit why I'm suggesting this. Umm… we've talked a lot about some of your history in relationships and your own concern that you know, your relationship with David looked very similar to some of the others. 

00:28:40
KAREN Yeah. 

00:28:40
KATHERINE M. HELM I mean, that one of the patterns is kind of you get into a relationship and then you know, you sort of begin to get distant from your friends. 

00:28:45
KAREN Yeah. 

00:28:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… having a social connections with other people won't necessarily replace the romantic connection but it can help you deal with some of the feelings of loneliness umm… so maybe the first step in this process is to develop other friendships with people. 

00:29:05
KAREN Okay. 

00:29:05
KATHERINE M. HELM What do you make about. 

00:29:10
KAREN You know, I, I think that that makes sense, I think being balanced in life is important umm… and I think that that has been my downfall is that, I sort of get very close to somebody and then I ignore my friends, I don't make time for them and it sort of becomes imbalanced. 

00:29:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:29:30
KAREN And I, I see now I think that, that's important and having other connections with people that that's important is for my you know, well being so… 

00:29:40
KATHERINE M. HELM I think that's a great place to start and you know, just give it a shot and see where, where might you start with that. 

00:29:50
KAREN Okay. Umm… I don't know, I guess, I could try to contact some of my friends that I haven't spoken to in a long time. I don't know how they'll receive me. If they'll be, you know angry that I haven't been keeping in close touch with them. You know maybe if I just explain to them you know, I'm making a lot of changes in my life that maybe they'll be more willing to sort of pick up where we left off… 

00:30:15
KATHERINE M. HELM And how do you think that would feel for you to do? 

00:30:20
KAREN I think it would relieve some of the, the anxiety I'm feeling right now. I think it would be helpful because you know, friendships you, you lean on people and that's what they're for and so I think that getting my mind off things would be beneficial. Absolutely! 

00:30:35
KATHERINE M. HELM So you have a pretty strong commitment at least today to give it a shot to sort of stop the usual kind of going and it's hard to find a new romantic partner with starting to build other friendships and other social connections in other areas. 

00:30:50
KAREN I just you've, you've brought to my attention that you know I have a pattern of, of doing this and I don't want to fall back into that. I want to work on being the best person I can be and so and I also don't want to spend every night you know, upset and anxious and… 

00:31:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:31:05
KAREN …So I will yes, I am willing to try something new at this point. 

00:31:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Well, that sounds great. 

00:31:10
KAREN Okay. 

00:31:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Let's start there and we'll go over it next week and see how it went. 

00:31:15
KAREN Okay. 

00:31:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

00:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of, of pairing, pairing stopping something with starting something. 

00:31:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. I think it is a good example. 

00:31:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, tell me why? Like, what did you see in this role play? Would you, as a counselor what did you experience? 

00:31:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Well, I solicited the client's agreement and she was pretty clear umm… you know, that even though she was experiencing feelings of being lonely and she felt kind of drawn because that's always been her pattern to go back to the relationship. 

00:31:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:31:45
KATHERINE M. HELM She doesn't want to do that anymore and so although she showed some reluctance to kind of starting something new uh… I asked her a scaling question, I said, on a scale of one to ten where are you in wanting to kind of try this new thing of developing other social relationships and she said a seven which is… 

00:32:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly that… 

00:32:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I'll try anything. 

00:32:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, right. That's right and so umm… I think that's one of the ways that to make this technique more successful. 

00:32:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON When you see that that, that enthusiasm, I mean because I'm thinking and some ways a seven is an arbitrary number of me. Your seven could be my five or… 

00:32:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, sure. 

00:32:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …But she's also pairing that was so emotion behind it. 

00:32:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:32:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is that a green light that to carry forward this is going to, this is going to work? 

00:32:30
KATHERINE M. HELM I think that's a great question umm… and as kind of a, a newer therapist in the field, I would have said yes. 

00:32:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:32:35
KATHERINE M. HELM But I think it's enthusiasm to begin the process. It doesn't necessarily mean the client will follow through or doesn't necessarily mean they'll be successful on their first attempt and all of that is okay and in some ways good counters will sort of normalize that. 

00:32:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:32:55
KATHERINE M. HELM So although I kind of will always support my client's enthusiasm, I recognize that change is a process and there are many kind of bumps on the journey of change. 

00:33:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I noticed in that clip too. You spent a fair amount of time with her into what she wanted to stop, making her really aware that you, you do want to stop this right that the you know, there are some resistance in the reasons why you might maintain this behavior. She came in wanting to stop this right and she has a pattern she knows that she can jump into and she wants to really change that pattern. 

00:33:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:33:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then, when that was kind of stylish then you jumped in and kind of began to say okay and what could we do differently. 

00:33:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:33:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Look like you kind of suggested a new idea for her. 

00:33:35
KATHERINE M. HELM I, I did suggest a new idea umm… even though I think it's important as counters that we it's okay to suggest things but you also can't be that tight to the suggestion. 

00:33:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, okay. 

00:33:45
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, because if you know, she wasn't favorable to doing it or let's say she tried it and she said you know, this just isn't me then as a counselor I should collaborate with her to find something else. So I do think every once in a while it is okay to make a suggestion. 

00:34:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:34:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… for example in the role play, I actually suggested meet up groups. 

00:34:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:34:05
KATHERINE M. HELM And the client said, "Hey maybe I could call some old friends" and I thought great. So she actually came up with her own suggestion which is even better. 

00:34:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that because she had talked about what her pattern was that when she gets over involved these relationships, she stops calling your friends… 

00:34:20
KATHERINE M. HELM That's right. 

00:34:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …Or actually she never sees her friends anymore and so you kind of, in a way put that idea in her head and she went with me what she's more willing to do. 

00:34:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly! And, and as any time a client comes up with their own idea, it's far better than what the counselor could come up with. 

00:34:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, would you do this any differently with, with other clients? 

00:34:40
KATHERINE M. HELM I might, umm… that's going to depend on many factors. So, it's going to depend on who the client is? Umm… we talked earlier that I do counseling through kind of a multicultural perspective… 

00:34:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:34:50
KATHERINE M. HELM …which means I really work to understand how culture and gender sexual orientation social class all of these things influence the way the client sees the world. So, for this particular client that might be a good suggestion. For another client that would not be. 

00:35:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like, in some ways the, the doing something right is really relative based on controversy of what the client's experiences and what they're kind of willing to do. 

00:35:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, exactly. 

00:35:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, let's move on to, to our next skill, which is role playing. 

00:35:25
Assessment Strategies 

00:35:25
Structured Rehearsal or Role-Playing 

00:35:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What do you mean by a role play? 

00:35:35
KATHERINE M. HELM A role play is an exercise uh… where a client can get some practice doing something because uh, it's safer to do it in session with you the counselor than it might be to do in the real world and during the role play you know, the counselor and the client can observe how they feel about things umm… they can stop and start again umm… they can practice saying things in the way they want to say and so role play can be a very powerful tool in helping a client make particular changes in their lives. 

00:36:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's almost like a rehearsal at time like… 

00:36:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:36:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …So clients in their mind like have an idea of how they want to do something and just might be in their head most of the time. 

00:36:20
KATHERINE M. HELM That's right. 

00:36:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, but then with the counselor they might begin to act out. 

00:36:25
KATHERINE M. HELM That's right and I think in some ways umm… the counselor can be very supportive and make observations. 

00:36:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:36:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh… sometimes emotional observations you know, the client gets upset during certain thing so, I think it's, it's again it's a powerful tool and it's a safe way to practice some of thing. 

00:36:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, it's like your coach I mean, they practice you're coaching them in some ways how to… 

00:36:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:36:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …How to help them. 

00:36:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:36:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON When might a counselor use a role play? 

00:36:50
KATHERINE M. HELM So, a role play is flexible which is why it can be such a great tool and you can use a role play umm… any time a client wants to let's say umm… for example, if they want to have a conversation with somebody umm… you can role play how to have that conversation. Uh… you can role play if a client wants to kind of do something different or practice a new particular skill. Umm… I've even role played kind of, I've been an interviewer for client looking for kind of um, how they act on a job… 

00:37:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so it sounds again it's kind of a behavioral aspect in which they want to try something, a little bit different and get some expertise of, of the counselor to kind of help them maybe get their needs met or kind of express themselves little differently. 

00:37:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah and as you know, the kind of role of the counselor is to sort of be supportive umm… as well as to kind of give feedback if, if necessary umm… to sort of what the client is doing because, sometimes you know, uh, in a role play you can sort of discover things about the client that they're not aware of their, sort of wringing their hands as they think about having this conversation or something like that. 

00:38:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So some ways, its helping them learn to be more effective in terms of actually kind of carrying out the action to… 

00:38:05
KATHERINE M. HELM I definitely agree with that Matt. 

00:38:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so in just a moment we're going to see you work with Cynthia. 

00:38:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:38:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you, can you please set up this clip. 

00:38:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, so in this clip, Cynthia is six weeks away from her wedding. 

00:38:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:38:20
KATHERINE M. HELM And uh… she, her dad left the family when she was 12 and she is really debating having him walk her down the aisle, which kind of in some ways is a public declaration… 

00:38:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:38:30
KATHERINE M. HELM …Of their relationship and all of these feelings of anger and hurt are coming back as she struggles with, do I want him to walk down the aisle when he hasn't been there for me. 

00:38:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great, sounds good. 

00:38:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Hi, Cynthia. How was your week? 

00:38:45
CYNTHIA It's been good. A little busy but overall it was good. 

00:38:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I wanna imagine with your wedding in six weeks. It's very busy. 

00:38:55
CYNTHIA Yeah, I've had to do a lot of you know, finishing up with the small detail. So, that's been a little stressful but overall it's been okay. 

00:39:05
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, you've, you've been on my mind. I thought of you right before our session today because I know that you were having a lot of anxiety umm… because your dad's going to walk you down the aisle. 

00:39:15
CYNTHIA Yes. 

00:39:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I can even see it. 

00:39:15
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:39:15
KATHERINE M. HELM And you know, you haven't had the best of relationship with him since he kind of walked out on your family when you were just 12. Umm… can you talk to me a little bit about the anxiety you're feeling? 

00:39:30
CYNTHIA Well, I mean, I think you know, the biggest part of the anxiety for me as if I'm making the right decision to kind of let my dad back into my after what he's done so… 

00:39:40
KATHERINE M. HELM You're angry even as you talk about it. 

00:39:40
CYNTHIA Yeah, yeah, I'm really angry, I feel like he really robbed me of a lot of my childhood years and my, my teenage years really and so I just, I don't know if I'm making the right session to let him be a part of my life and a part of this really big day. 

00:39:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, you know in kind of a very public way. 

00:40:00
CYNTHIA Yes, yeah. 

00:40:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Have you imagined him walking you down the aisle? 

00:40:05
CYNTHIA I have umm… I kind of, you know, see it going to ways, it's either going to be really, really good or I'm just going to thought and conform, I wish that I had decided to not have him there. 

00:40:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, so in some ways you're even still torn about the decision to ask him. 

00:40:20
CYNTHIA Definitely. 

00:40:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. What would it be like for you to talk to him about it? 

00:40:30
CYNTHIA I mean, I don't think I really even know how to talk to my dad really so, it's hard for me to even picture about it. 

00:40:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh-huh, because, I get the sense from you that you, you have a lot that you want to say umm… so I wonder what if it would be okay with you to try something. 

00:40:45
CYNTHIA Okay. 

00:40:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, so before we do this umm… I'm going to suggest, I'm not at all encouraging you to talk to your dad, we're to not talk to your dad. I think that we can talk about if that's a good decision for you but, it might help if we do what's called a role play in here you and I where, if you could pretend uh… that you're talking to your dad so, just pretend umm… that you know, I'm your dad in this chair and you know, you're going to tell him all the things you've wanted to say and that you've been holding back. 

00:41:20
CYNTHIA Okay. 

00:41:25
CYNTHIA Umm… Dad, I wanted to talk to you about you know, the decision that I've been trying to make about having you walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. I think, I'm feeling really torn because there's a part of me that feels very angry with you I feel like you really robbed me and our family of having a relationship with you and to be honest, I don't really know if I even want to rekindle that relationship now. And so I'm just, to be honest, I'm just totally angry with you. 

00:41:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Let's stop for a second, what did that feel like for you to do? 

00:42:00
CYNTHIA It feels good but it also feels kind of scary because I can't really, it's hard to imagine actually saying that to him in person. 

00:42:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Would that be all you want to say to him? 

00:42:15
CYNTHIA I think there's probably just so many things that it would take a lot of time for me to figure out, how to say everything. 

00:42:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:42:20
CYNTHIA I want to say of all these years. 

00:42:25
KATHERINE M. HELM So you spoke to how angry you were at him. I wonder, if we could kind of do another kind of mini role play and you could speak to how hurt you are. 

00:42:35
CYNTHIA Okay, Dad has I'm considering having you walk me down the aisle, I think that it's important for me to tell you that you know, since you left when I was 12, I… I felt really abandoned by you and I think the rest of the family did too and you know, it's just been kind of a disappointment to have you not there and you know it just feels like growing up there as a part of the family that was missing and you know now that you're back it's kind of hard to figure out where you fit in back in the family. 

00:43:15
KATHERINE M. HELM What was it like to say that? 

00:43:15
CYNTHIA I think that one feels even harder than the first one where I was feeling more angry. 

00:43:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I could even kind of tell on your face… 

00:43:25
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:43:25
KATHERINE M. HELM …That in some ways you're even still holding yourself back little bit. 

00:43:25
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:43:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Did you feel exposed? 

00:43:30
CYNTHIA Yeah, definitely I felt like if I, if I probably would've kept going, it would have became emotional for me… 

00:43:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, yeah, because it is very emotional. 

00:43:40
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:43:40
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, and as I sort of imagine you sort of still six weeks before the wedding being torn with this decision about whether he should walk you down the aisle or not… 

00:43:50
CYNTHIA Right. 

00:43:50
KATHERINE M. HELM What did doing those two role plays, what did that do for you? 

00:43:55
CYNTHIA I guess it showed me that you know, I thought like for a long time I wouldn't know what to say but I guess part of me really does know what I would want to say to him umm… 

00:44:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Pretty easily, it's all right there right. 

00:44:05
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

00:44:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, definitely. How or did doing something like that kind of you know, maybe as you think about it today or later umm… do you think it will help you make your decision? 

00:44:20
CYNTHIA Yeah, definitely I mean, I think just knowing like, like I just said, Just knowing that I actually do know how I feel about my dad coming back to my life or little bit more than I thought I did… 

00:44:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh-huh. 

00:44:30
CYNTHIA …That those reassuring. 

00:44:35
KATHERINE M. HELM I think you did a really nice job with that, I can see that you have a lot to say, a lot there. Maybe you and I can continue to explore whether that's a good idea to sort of say those things to him or not. I think either you could go either way with that. 

00:44:50
CYNTHIA Yeah, I think that would be something that would be really helpful for me. 

00:44:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, maybe that's something that we can, kind of talk about next week. 

00:44:55
CYNTHIA Okay. 

00:44:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

00:45:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of a role play? 

00:45:00
KATHERINE M. HELM I believe it is. 

00:45:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Tell me more about why, what aspects of it you think make it a good example? 

00:45:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Well, you know, in the clip there are actually two role plays. 

00:45:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:45:15
KATHERINE M. HELM So… umm… you know, as I had set the kind of role play what it would be like to talk to her father, the first thing I noticed was that she role played feelings of anger. 

00:45:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:45:25
KATHERINE M. HELM And that came across very clearly in the role play but, what I felt was missing was, I didn't really see any of her hurt which is another very important part of her experience from dealing with her dad and so I asked her if she'd do it again and this time kind of talk about how he heard her. 

00:45:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:45:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… and I was able to observe in both cases what her anger looked like, she physically looked angry and then I could even see the hurt on her face as she talked about, how she felt abandoned by him. 

00:45:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So that's that maybe, the coaching aspect is as you watch the client as you watch her kind of work through this initially you noticed maybe disconnect… 

00:46:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:46:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …emotional state and then I was watching that, you can get that feedback that… 

00:46:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:46:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …You might try this differently and so she tries it again. Umm… and then maybe that can lead to her having more successful outcome. 

00:46:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah and, and I guess I want to make clear the outcome isn't necessarily that I wanted Cynthia to have this conversation with her father. 

00:46:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:46:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… you know, sometimes our clients know that this is not a good idea or sometimes it might be a good idea so the role play initially uh… might be to allow the client to sort of process something emotionally uh… she had been keeping all of this back and so met my idea and having her do this role play was to really get her to kind of talk some of this out so it didn't just kind of sit within her. 

00:46:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, some ways when initial think of role plays almost like, like a behavioral rehearsal you're saying it's actually more than that, that it can be behavioral rehearsal but also can be in unpacking or a way to recognize as emotional states or deep feelings. 

00:47:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, yes. 

00:47:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… and you mentioned kind of, there's no necessarily pressure or expectation that's necessarily has this conversation with her father. 

00:47:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, umm… because he might now be receptive to that conversation uh… so you know, I think, I might have alluded to that we could talk about you know, in future sessions if this is something that she really wanted to do if this would be a good idea but just the initial point of the role play was really to help her kind of process some of these deeper feelings that she had. 

00:47:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, so some ways regardless of the goal, the goal isn't to have the conversation necessarily with the father as it's always actually is the process of having that role play. 

00:47:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:47:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Let me make sure, I got this right. It sounds like for the role play, the goal is actually kind of, kind of feel the feelings and actually act it out with you in session. But let's say, she goes and has this conversation with her father and he doesn't change. Now, what happens. 

00:47:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Well, I think that counselors need to remember that you know, change really has to do with the person in the room with you. I'm really not focused on the father's changing. Umm… you know, neither the client nor I have any control over whether he changes. Umm… it's really more about the clients, her thoughts, her feelings uh… so we don't even focus on whether or not uh, her father will change and I think that you know, let's say that uh, she had this conversation with her father you know, this is something that I would process with her. He may not change in fact, there's probably a good likelihood that given past behaviors, he wouldn't change but that's not really always the point. Sometimes clients need to kind of say things to somebody who hurt them in a way that they themselves can be proud of. 

00:48:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like, in many ways what you're saying is that, regardless where or not the father changes doesn't really matter, change is really about the client… 

00:48:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, sure, and we would want him to change if that is what she wants but that really has nothing to do with kind of my work with the client, that's outside of her control and mine. 

00:49:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Let's move on to our next goal which is called identifying the resistance to change. 

00:49:10
Assessment Strategies 

00:49:10
Identifying Resistance to Change 

00:49:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I'm, I'm wondering why it's important to identify resistance to change? 

00:49:20
KATHERINE M. HELM I think it's important Matt, to identify resistance to change, because it usually means there's something going on that umm… not prevents the client from changing but that should be looked at either in the relationship between the counselor and client or sort of within the, the client himself or herself. So it usually means something's going on that might be a barrier to sort of the client getting to where they might like to be. 

00:49:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right and some use and no's in that, that the change is so easy people do it all the time, right. 

00:49:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:49:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, the fact the people are coming to see someone like you, it means there's often probably something else going on. 

00:50:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah and change is difficult umm… and I think that resistance might be a natural part of the change process. 

00:50:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so when you're with the client and… you identify some resistance to change, what do you do? 

00:50:15
KATHERINE M. HELM I think that's a good question and I think what I do and what I hope that all of us learn to do is explore what the resistance is about. 

00:50:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:50:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh… what you don't do is get defensive or angry. Umm… if I'm honest sometimes it's a little frustrating but I think it's important to as a counselor not at all personalize it because as we've talked about before the change process is really about the client and we can collaborate with our, our clients on changing but really it's not about us. 

00:50:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So sounds like it's going back and looking at it again across the change process that resistance in some ways isn't normal and natural part of change. 

00:50:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

00:51:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And recognizing kind of where the client is with what they're aware of or potentially what they're not aware of, right. 

00:51:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, exactly, that's a great point. 

00:51:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good, so in this next clip you're going to work with Shawntlle. 

00:51:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

00:51:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON She's a client you've worked with before, can you set up this clip? 

00:51:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, so in this clip uh… Shantelle and I have worked together uh… for about two months and she is really struggling with social anxiety. 

00:51:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:51:25
KATHERINE M. HELM She has a relationship with her boyfriend and he's very social and he wants her to be very, very social and so she's come in really wanting to work on kind of getting more involved socially and not feeling so anxious. 

00:51:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:51:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Hi, Shantlle. How was your week? 

00:51:45
SHANTLLE Umm… it was okay, it's okay. 

00:51:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, just okay this week? 

00:51:50
SHANTLLE Yeah. Umm… I've been kind of dealing with like some stomach issues so… I just haven't been feeling so great so… yeah, all about this week. 

00:52:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Did you get a chance to do the homework that we talked about? 

00:52:05
SHANTLLE I didn't umm… I just was feeling really sick and I just you know, wasn't feeling like going out or doing anything so… no, I didn't get a chance to do it. 

00:52:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. You know, I've been noticing we've been working together for about two months now umm… and you came in because you were having a lot of social anxiety and you really wanted to, to do something about that and you and I sat down together and came up with kind of a plan and talked about doing some social experiments umm… and, and those haven't worked out. Umm… what do you make of that? 

00:52:40
SHANTLLE Well, I mean, I want to make the changes, I want to do that, I just, I don't know every time I'm supposed to do something that we've talked about it just seems like something happened… 

00:52:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

00:52:50
SHANTLLE …And I can't get around to do it again. 

00:52:55
KATHERINE M. HELM What do you think that's about for you? 

00:53:00
SHANTLLE Umm… I don't know, I, I maybe I'm just afraid. 

00:53:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Say more about being afraid. 

00:53:10
SHANTLLE Maybe I'm, I'm afraid of not doing it right or not don't know how… 

00:53:15
KATHERINE M. HELM So you're, you're afraid of kind of messing it up or maybe even failing? 

00:53:20
SHANTLLE Yeah. 

00:53:20
KATHERINE M. HELM And you think that permits you from trying it? 

00:53:25
SHANTLLE Yeah. 

00:53:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, that's kind of hard to talk about. 

00:53:30
SHANTLLE Yeah. 

00:53:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Is that the first time you've said that out loud that you're afraid that you might fail? 

00:53:35
SHANTLLE Yeah. 

00:53:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I think that's okay, I mean, I think you know, you came in and you were pretty gung ho and you said, ‘hey I really wanted to change this, umm… I want to be better socially' and maybe you know we came up with a plan, maybe we were too ambitious. Umm… I really do believe that you can get where you want to be. Umm… But maybe we need to take a step back and look at things again and maybe come up with a new plan. What, what would you make of that? 

00:54:05
SHANTLLE Umm… I mean, I know that I, I want to change especially for my boyfriend and he's been complaining that I'm not going out and being social so I think I need to but, at the same time I am really scared at, at not doing it right or yeah, I'm feeling… 

00:54:25
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, I want to validate umm… how scary change can be but I, I heard something I want to kind of bring up that you said you wanted to change for your boyfriend. Say more about that. 

00:54:40
SHANTLLE Well, I really love him and I want to be you know, umm… a good partner for him and so he likes to go out a lot. I don't, I'll I'd rather stay and obviously you know that and umm… I just, I want to make him happy and I want him to stay with me. 

00:54:55
KATHERINE M. HELM maybe we've just discovered why you're reluctant to make this change. Do you understand my meaning, you wouldn't be making the change for you. Sometimes when you make a change for somebody else, it doesn't stick because that's not what we, we really want to do, does, does that fit your experience at all? 

00:55:20
SHANTLLE Maybe a little bit. 

00:55:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, so if we go back several weeks and when we look at some of the homework that you and I came up with together and we look at sort of you know this plan umm… I don't think it's that you can't do the plan, I think it's maybe you don't want to do the plan because it's, it might not be you or it might not be where you're sort of ready to begin. What do you make of what I'm saying? 

00:55:45
SHANTLLE No I, I think that that's actually really true. 

00:55:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:55:50
SHANTLLE Yeah, umm… this is something you know, I'm pursuing because I don't want to lose my relationship. 

00:55:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:55:55
SHANTLLE I don't know so much that I myself have a problem with maybe not being so social umm… 

00:56:05
KATHERINE M. HELM So can I stop you for second? 

00:56:05
SHANTLLE Yeah. 

00:56:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Can you say that again? 

00:56:10
SHANTLLE I don't think it's me that has a problem… 

00:56:10
KATHERINE M. HELM that's interesting, isn't it. So you don't necessarily have a problem not being as social as he. What might be a more realistic goal for us then? 

00:56:25
[sil.] 

00:56:30
SHANTLLE Umm… I don't know, umm… maybe something on a smaller scale or maybe something more to do with him then, then so much me and going out and being social. 

00:56:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Well, you know, he's not in the room. 

00:56:50
SHANTLLE Okay. 

00:56:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… so we can't work on him um, but I heard something I'd like to bring to your attention if that's okay. So, you still have some anxiety about certain social situations. 

00:57:00
SHANTLLE Yeah. 

00:57:00
KATHERINE M. HELM But you really don't want to be a social as he is. 

00:57:05
SHANTLLE No. 

00:57:05
KATHERINE M. HELM What would it be like for you if in here we sort of work on ways to kind of decrease your anxiety but in the social situations that you are interested in participating in. 

00:57:15
SHANTLLE Okay. 

00:57:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Instead of sort of trying to make you into somebody you want or to do something that you may not be ready for or even really want. 

00:57:25
SHANTLLE Okay. That might sound better because you know, I do want to have less anxiety in some situations but I'm not looking to be somebody who goes out all the time and, and is really talkative that's not who I am so… 

00:57:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. So can I check in with you here for a second. 

00:57:45
SHANTLLE Sure. 

00:57:45
KATHERINE M. HELM So are you agreeing with me because it's something that you want to do or you agreeing with me because it might be easier right now in this moment to agree with me. 

00:57:55
SHANTLLE Maybe a little of both. 

00:57:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:58:00
SHANTLLE I definitely want to have less anxiety like it doesn't feel good. 

00:58:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

00:58:00
SHANTLLE But I'm also I think, a little worried of me be letting you down if I don't agree with you. 

00:58:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. umm…. and how would you feel about letting yourself down? 

00:58:15
SHANTLLE I don't want to do that, it doesn't feel good to do that. 

00:58:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. So maybe our, our work and I don't want to put words in your mouth it's, it's really important that you that you come up with the plan. We can collaborate together but, it's your plan we saw what happened before you didn't fail, not at all. You just did something that you didn't necessarily want to do, right. Umm… so I want to pose the question to you once again, what would you be most interested in doing in here with me? 

00:58:50
SHANTLLE Well, maybe figuring out why I get so anxious in certain situations. 

00:58:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

00:58:55
SHANTLLE I would love to know why. 

00:58:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. So maybe that's something that we can, we can work on. Umm… before we end for the day, I do want to assure you of something. You're concerned about my disappointment. 

00:59:10
SHANTLLE yeah. 

00:59:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, you know, I want to assure you here, you're not going to disappoint me, right. I think another thing that we can work on is sort of your kind of disappointing yourself but you're certainly not going to disappoint me. 

00:59:25
SHANTLLE Okay. thanks, I feel a bit better. 

00:59:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, so let's go ahead and pick up there next week. 

00:59:30
SHANTLLE Okay. 

00:59:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this clip a good example of that to find resistance to change/ 

00:59:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, it's definitely good example. 

00:59:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, tell me why, what, what do you see in that clip or that in the experience? 

00:59:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Matt, I think you see a couple of things umm… you know, in some ways I said to her, I said you know, what's going on. I mean, we've been working together for two months and you've come in and you know, we sort of you know, this was the goal to do these social experiments but you know, one week she had stomach issues all that kind of prevented her from doing the homework umm… you know, another week she said you know, every time I try to do it something seems to come up. 

01:00:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

01:00:15
KATHERINE M. HELM And a lot of times if something seems to come up there's something deeper going on that needs to be explored and that was her resistance to kind of making this change. 

01:00:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So those are like signs or symptoms that, there's something that's going on that maybe isn't necessarily apparent. 

01:00:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

01:00:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay and in that clip it sounds like, there was this moment in which there's nowhere to us that, that the change she wants maybe isn't necessarily what she said initially she wanted. 

01:00:45
KATHERINE M. HELM I think that's a great point. I mean, through some exploration and I definitely want to kind of highlight that I didn't just kind of rush in. I did some exploration like you know, I'm not personalizing as the counselor why she doesn't want to make this change? I'm really, I come to it with a umm… an attitude of curiosity what's it about that you said you want to make this change but it doesn't seem to be happening and what do we find out. We found out something very powerful, she was making the change not for herself but for her boyfriend which is not going to work. 

01:01:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right and some ways that resistance than becomes quite normal. 

01:01:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, right and she may have been yourself up not doing or not doing the homework or all things are working but the reality is that she wasn't fully in because it really isn't what she wanted. 

01:01:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly and we also talked about how she feared disappointing me, the counselor and how she also feared not being successful, she feared failure so all of these things when you began to explore them certainly made her resistance make a lot of sense. 

01:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What did you do in this intervention with her? 

01:01:50
KATHERINE M. HELM I think the primary thing I did is kind of take her through the process of exploring what the resistance was about. So once I made it clear you know, I'm not going to be disappointed in you but something isn't working. Let's talk about what's not working and we discovered why it's not working because it wasn't something she really wanted to do. 

01:02:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And you got to step hard that uh… you're really careful to make sure that there were, there was no judgment in the room. That you weren't judging her for not doing it and that you're opening the door that maybe something else was going on… 

01:02:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

01:02:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …And that sounds like an imitation to, to explore this a little bit more. 

01:02:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes exactly. 

01:02:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, let's move for a next skill which is called ‘The some of it's parts'. 

01:02:30
Assessment Strategies 

01:02:30
The Sum of Its Parts 

01:02:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON This skill is called "The sum of its parts". What do you mean by that? 

01:02:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… so when a client comes in with a big issue… 

01:02:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:02:50
KATHERINE M. HELM …Umm… like working on communication that in itself is too big to sort of take on as a whole and so sometimes it's better to break a bigger problem down into its smaller parts for several reasons one it makes it more manageable and that also helps the client to, and that the counselor feel less overwhelmed by this huge problem. 

01:03:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so it sounds like you're breaking into smaller kind of pieces. 

01:03:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Exact. 

01:03:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right and then taking together kind of would add up to kind of going to dealing or addressing the presenting concern. 

01:03:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, right? 

01:03:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. What would you use in intervention like this, when you are breaking it down. 

01:03:25
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, to be honest I think that as counselors we use it all the time. You know, if someone says you know, for example if I see a couple and the couple says you know, I'm here for communication problems. Well, what does that mean? Right and so for us to work affectively with the client we have to sort of take a problem in, in pieces. 

01:03:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:03:45
KATHERINE M. HELM So, I think that in some ways we do it all the time but it's especially important in the change process so that you can kind of have identified change. 

01:03:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right I was thinking it sounds like we do this all the time. 

01:03:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

01:03:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON This kind of what counselors do and maybe the difference might be as you're doing these small kinds of pieces at some point kind of saying, ‘hey we put all these pieces together look what we've got'. 

01:04:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, exactly. 

01:04:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, in a minute we're going to see, see role play umm… with, with you and Laura and I wonder if you could set this up for us. 

01:04:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. Laura is actually struggling with communication issues that's what she's come in with and in this role play, she begins to kind of describe uh, this interaction that she's had with her professor in which she sends an, an e-mail that the professor says is inappropriate uh… the professor says she is unprofessional and Laura has all kinds of feelings of shame and this fit really well in with the issue that we've been working on in terms of improving communication skills so Matt, one of the things that I do with her is to sort of take instead of taking communication problems as a whole, I say let's talk about this particular e-mail. 

01:04:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:05:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Hi, Laura. How was your week? 

01:05:00
LAURA It was okay, I had a little incident happen over the week with my professors. 

01:05:05
KATHERINE M. HELM What happened? 

01:05:05
LAURA Well, I e-mailed her about looking at one of my papers for her class umm… just because you know I want to make sure I was going to get and she didn't get back to me. 

01:05:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

01:05:20
LAURA And so, I got kind of angry and so I fired off this kind of e-mail in all caps and because I wanted to, I want to get a prompt response and so she ended up responding to me but kind of telling me that she was unhappy with how I e-mailed her and that it was unprofessional and a lot of things that I've heard before. 

01:05:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, so how did it feel to hear from her? 

01:05:45
LAURA Well, I mean I really like this professor and I respected her and so it's not, it doesn't feel good to have someone else tell me you know, that they're seeing these qualities in me that others have pointed out as well umm… and make me feel like I'm probably not making as much progress as maybe I thought I was. 

01:06:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, can you tell me a little bit about sort of right after you got that response from her what feeling you had? 

01:06:05
LAURA Whole regret. 

01:06:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:06:05
LAURA I thought I'd sent that e-mail and kind of guilt and you know just feeling overall bad that I kind of let myself up into that behavior again. 

01:06:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, so you really feel like you let yourself down. 

01:06:20
LAURA Yeah. 

01:06:20
KATHERINE M. HELM You know. 

01:06:20
LAURA Definitely. 

01:06:20
KATHERINE M. HELM May be even some shame. 

01:06:20
LAURA Yeah. 

01:06:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:06:25
LAURA Yeah, that's a good word for it. 

01:06:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, you know, and that's in some ways why you came to counseling in the first place to kind of work on becoming a better communicator. So, you know, I hear this regret from you. You regret kind of uh, sending this email when you didn't get the response that you want. So, on the one hand I, I definitely hear that. On the other hand in some ways I think it really allows us an opportunity to sort of directly work on something that just happened. 

01:06:55
LAURA Yeah. 

01:06:55
KATHERINE M. HELM You know so, let's go back a little bit. 

01:06:55
LAURA Okay. 

01:06:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… so you send your professor uh, an email and asking her to look at your paper and then she doesn't get back to you. 

01:07:05
LAURA Okay. 

01:07:05
KATHERINE M. HELM In what you consider to be a timely way. Um… if you're going to send her an email, how would you have wanted to do it? 

01:07:15
LAURA Umm… I think, I felt comfortable with the first email I sent, umm… 

01:07:20
KATHERINE M. HELM What, what was in that email? 

01:07:20
LAURA Just kind of like, like, "Hello Professor, I was just wondering if you could take the time to look over umm… this paper for your speech pathology class umm… I'm really wanting to get a good grade and do well in your class I would just really appreciate it if you could take the time to do that". 

01:07:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, that sounds great. So you felt pretty confident with that email. 

01:07:40
LAURA Yeah. 

01:07:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. Tell me exactly what you remember saying in the other email. 

01:07:45
LAURA Umm… I think I said something along the lines of you know, you've taken really much too much time to get back to me. Umm… this program really stresses to us about being professional. I don't really feel that this is a professional behavior… 

01:08:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:08:00
LAURA …For you to show. 

01:08:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Let me stop you for second because I'm noticing your body language, even as you're sort of describing it. You know, does it, can you feel that. 

01:08:10
LAURA I think now that you're pointing it out, I notice that just talking about the second email I feel different. 

01:08:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, and tell me a little bit about feeling different. 

01:08:20
LAURA I guess, it makes me start to think if you know, was I wrong in feeling that way. Umm… and maybe it's like the feelings are wrong but it's just how I'm behaving about it that's wrong. 

01:08:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, so you know, it sounds like you're pretty legitimately frustrated that she didn't get back to you 

01:08:35
LAURA Yeah. 

01:08:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Right, so maybe we could kind of take a step back and talk about how you might construct an email in the way that you can feel like you're being a good communicator because it's clear to me based on what you just said, you definitely know how to do that. You did it the first time, you felt really good about that. 

01:08:55
LAURA Yeah. 

01:08:55
KATHERINE M. HELM But the second time you got really frustrated maybe even anxious and then it sounds like you know right away you kind of just channeled that into the second email. 

01:09:05
LAURA Yeah. 

01:09:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, so instead of kind of sending, well, will look, let's say you're going to send a second e-mail and you still feel a bit frustrated, right, if our goal is to be a better communicator and you're frustrated and angry how can you sort of appropriately construct that second email to your professor? What might you say? 

01:09:25
LAURA I think I would say, umm… you know, professor I had sent you an e-mail prior to this one. Umm… I just wanted to touch these with you again um… about you know, getting back to me with some corrections on that paper umm… and if you could let me know when you would have time to do that I would really appreciate it. 

01:09:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, how did that feel kind of kind, of right? 

01:09:50
LAURA It feels good umm… 

01:09:50
KATHERINE M. HELM But? 

01:09:55
LAURA But I think, I think it's, it's, it's just hard for me because I don't want others to feel like they can just kind of like walk all over me and just get back to me whenever she wants. So it's like I'm aware that I can do it but I'm afraid that you know, my anxiety about needing to get things done when I feel like they need to be done… 

01:10:15
KATHERINE M. HELM So you have a lot of stuff kind of going on in your head when you're getting ready to construct this email. 

01:10:20
LAURA Yeah. 

01:10:20
KATHERINE M. HELM you know and I wonder if the ‘but' you know, was that didn't feel exactly right either like the first one you know umm… so do it one more time for me. 

01:10:35
LAURA Okay. umm… professor, how are you. Umm… I just want to touch base with you again because I had sent you the paper earlier. Umm… I was just wondering… 

01:10:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Can I interrupt you? 

01:10:40
LAURA Yes. 

01:10:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Might you tell her you know she's busy like, you're busy. 

01:10:45
LAURA Yeah, I could do that. 

01:10:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

01:10:50
LAURA Okay, umm… hello professor, I just want to touch base with you about paper I sent you earlier. I know you're very busy, umm… but if you could just you know let me know about when you'll be able to get that paper back to me I would really appreciate it. 

01:11:05
KATHERINE M. HELM How does that feel? 

01:11:05
LAURA I thought better, I mean, I think just pointing out to me the fact that she's busy just like I'm busy… 

01:11:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:11:10
LAURA …changes my perspective of it a little bit 

01:11:15
KATHERINE M. HELM I can even see that, you look a little relieved. 

01:11:15
LAURA Yeah. 

01:11:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah how, how did the sort of knowing that she's busy frame it differently for you? 

01:11:25
LAURA Umm… well, I think it's just, you know reminds me that, she's a human and she has feelings too… 

01:11:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:11:25
LAURA …Just like you know I had feelings about getting angry that she didn't get back to me right away so… 

01:11:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

01:11:35
LAURA …I should probably be a little bit more sensitive to that. 

01:11:35
KATHERINE M. HELM And so I think you're allowed to be frustrated and even maybe a little irritated that she didn't get back to you right, but it can't really show up in the email. 

01:11:45
LAURA Right. 

01:11:45
KATHERINE M. HELM You know and it sounds like the very first e-mail and this last e-mail was something that you felt really confident about. 

01:11:50
LAURA Yeah. 

01:11:50
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, so it, it looks like even we just kind of talked about e-mail communication today but that might be one more step kind of in becoming a better communicator you know how to. You know, it looks like you can actually be really good at it when you want to. 

01:12:05
LAURA Yeah. 

01:12:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Right, but when you sort of respond you know kind of without thinking that's when you're not proud of the way that you communicate. 

01:12:15
LAURA Yeah, yeah, that actually feels really good because you know like I said earlier, I came in here kind of feeling like maybe I haven't been making progress… 

01:12:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I can say, you have. 

01:12:20
LAURA …Yeah, it feels good to have to point out that. Maybe I do have the skills and it's kind of forgetting… 

01:12:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:12:25
LAURA …to put them into practice. 

01:12:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. So, let's kind of pick up their next week. 

01:12:30
LAURA Okay. 

01:12:30
KATHERINE M. HELM We kind of see what happens over the next week. 

01:12:35
LAURA Okay, sounds good. 

01:12:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay. 

01:12:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of, of the intervention it's one of its parts? 

01:12:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I think this is an excellent example. 

01:12:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON yeah, tell me why? Kind of what, tell me what you experience in that? 

01:12:50
KATHERINE M. HELM I think it's a good example because, I really focused the client on the e-mail, I mean another counselor might have done it differently but I thought it very important because it's, it was a perfect example of exactly kind of the things that we've been talking about. Umm… she has already sort of had this history of knowing that she has issues communicating umm… she's had issues and kind of being a student communicating with professors and this kind of clinched that for us. 

01:13:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, this is the percent of concern and boom just like that… 

01:13:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly. 

01:13:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …she talks about having this issue happening with, with this e-mail. 

01:13:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

01:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I notice what was interesting isn't that, when you're processing that with her and she was talk about how she would write it differently, you interrupted her. 

01:13:30
KATHERINE M. HELM I did. 

01:13:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You stopped, you stopped her talking, is that okay. 

01:13:35
KATHERINE M. HELM I think it is okay to interrupt clients from time to time. Umm… when I interrupt, I do so mindfully. 

01:13:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure, sure. 

01:13:45
KATHERINE M. HELM I interrupt clients to get clarity on sort of what's happening or if I'm confused because, I can't really be effective if I don't know sort of what's going on but also I interrupt because right then, right there in that moment something is happening that I either need to process or clarify or draw all the client's attention to and I interrupted her because you know, I thought wow in this email if she just would have added umm… you know, "hey I know you're busy", just that sentence umm… would maybe allow the professor to sort of go okay, you're acknowledging my experience and, and in some ways this can help to teach the client, when you, that's a great communication stratergy. 

01:14:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:14:30
KATHERINE M. HELM When you acknowledge somebody else's experience, it makes them less likely to be defensive and more likely sort of to get them to do what's favorable towards you. 

01:14:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it's funny, I also noticed there seemed to be shift in, in the client as well almost like "oh, I'm busy but you're busy too". 

01:14:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

01:14:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like, there is almost like an empathy and thinking outside not just about her needs or her thing but a recognition that, "oh this other person is involved with this. 

01:15:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I think that was a very powerful moment for the client because, she was able to sort of step outside herself and touch somebody else's experience and in doing so it made her a better communicator which is the ultimate goal of our work together. 

01:15:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, when we look at this example with Laura how would something like this be part of it, larger kind of action plan for her? 

01:15:20
KATHERINE M. HELM So again, her goal is to build better communication skills. Umm… this example was her written communication skills but kind of having her see if she can kind of understand somebody else's perspective you know, I can help her sort of build this into her ultimate goal of being a better communicator because good communicators at least in the settings that we're talking about… 

01:15:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:15:40
KATHERINE M. HELM …That she's in. Do recognize and incorporate somebody else's perspective. 

01:15:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, and there's an aspect here which is not that different from maybe doing a role play in some ways that you did this collaboratively work together. She got some feedback on it and, and goal would be that you know, hopefully or you know, she might have better communication in future with, with her faculty. 

01:16:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly, I mean this client in some ways, we're lucky had some insight you know, we talked a lot about her emotional experience of being frustrated and then channeling it into the e-mail and in that brief clip we talked about you can still be frustrated but how do you say things in a way that your professor might be more receptive to. 

01:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good, right. Let's move on to our next goal which is call obtaining agreement and commitment. 

01:16:30
Assessment Strategies 

01:16:30
Obtaining Agreement/Commitment 

01:16:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, why is it important to, to, to attain it and agreement and some type of commitment from your clients? 

01:16:45
KATHERINE M. HELM I think it's specially important Matt, because you want buy in from the clients. Umm… it's sort of full disclosure about what's happening and this is another way of assessing where they are in the change process. 

01:17:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Don't all clients have that initially when they come? 

01:17:00
KATHERINE M. HELM That's a great question maybe in sort of being no. Umm… I think some clients do but I also think that it can change over time so getting a client's buy in is not only respectable but it also makes the change process and umm… and the collaboration with the client on the change process a bit easier. 

01:17:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like there's something that you don't just do one time. 

01:17:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, I would, I would definitely agree with that. 

01:17:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so, over the, over the kind of course of counseling you might, might continually ask them for a commitment to an agreement that is what they want to do and… 

01:17:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I like it in some ways to kind of informed consent. 

01:17:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:17:40
KATHERINE M. HELM You're going to sort of ask the client, what do you think about this? Umm… how likely are you or how committed are you to sort of making this change? 

01:17:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It seems like part of that also is a way to kind of flatten out the counseling relationship so the client gets by and you're not the one doing all the work. Do you want to do the work on this and can we work together? 

01:18:00
KATHERINE M. HELM I would definitely agree with that. 

01:18:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how exactly do you do this with clients? Where ways that you kind of do this? 

01:18:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Very simply, I ask. You know, I say you know, umm… what would it be like for you, if we did this. Umm… How do you feel about that? So, I will kind of try to solicit where they are before I ask for their agreement or commitment because maybe they don't want to do this which is okay, maybe you know, they don't want to commit to doing this particular thing right now which needs to be okay. 

01:18:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I notice that you get us to asking and it's an invitation to kind of be involved but again the client has, has the, the ability and the right to kind of say, I don't want to do that. It sounds like… 

01:18:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly or maybe I don't want to do this right now. 

01:18:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right now, good. Okay. So in a moment we're going to see you work with Sarah. Can you tell us what, what's happening this reclaim and what we're going to see? 

01:18:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure Matt. So umm… Sarah is coming in because she's in a relationship where her boyfriend constantly puts her down umm… she is really struggling with you know, what this means for her she begins to kind of talk about how um, upset she is that she you know, can't believe that you know, things have gotten so out of hand and we really look at ways of kind of helping her stand up for herself umm… help her practice certain assertiveness strategies and in the clip I had obtain her agreements umm… and her commitment to becoming more assertive in her relationship. 

01:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like the viewers should look at kind of how you do that, how you work with her and it's kind of get a sense of her and her consent the kind of, kind of move forward in a certain direction. 

01:19:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Exactly and maybe even how I sort of process up to getting agreement sort of her thoughts and feelings about that. 

01:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

01:19:50
KATHERINE M. HELM How's your week Sarah? 

01:19:50
SARAH Umm… it wasn't good umm… I got into a huge fight with Kevin umm… he just, you know, yelled at me and was screaming and umm… I just don't know what to do anymore. 

01:20:10
KATHERINE M. HELM You really look kind of dejected. 

01:20:15
SARAH Yeah. I'm exhausted. 

01:20:15
KATHERINE M. HELM You look exhausted. 

01:20:15
SARAH Yeah. 

01:20:20
KATHERINE M. HELM To the point I'm concerned. 

01:20:20
SARAH I mean like, I'm okay, like I'm going to work and you know, I'm, I'm doing everything I have to do in my daily life you know, and I'm here but I just, I am so overwhelmed with this relationship and you know I feel like he just walks all over me, like all the time. 

01:20:40
KATHERINE M. HELM What's it like for you to be walked all over all the time? 

01:20:40
SARAH It feels awful, it just, I feel like I don't have a voice at all in my relationship. Like, I just, he doesn't seem to care about my feelings at all. It's like all about him all the time. 

01:20:55
KATHERINE M. HELM You're angry about that. 

01:21:00
SARAH Yeah, I mean, I'm not a bad girlfriend like I'm really not and I, when he gets angry and he just yells and like it's like nothing I can do to you know, get him to see my side of things ever and it's always my fault and I'm just, I'm so upset with it. 

01:21:15
KATHERINE M. HELM like you're fed up with it. 

01:21:20
SARAH Yeah, I'm really fed up with it. 

01:21:20
KATHERINE M. HELM You know I want to draw your attention back a little bit. You know, you said that's awful you know, and to sort of say you're in this relationship and it feels awful is very powerful. 

01:21:35
SARAH Well, at this point that's how I feel like, I think after everything that's happened between us it is awful. I mean, we used to have better times. It used to be happier those times have just gotten fewer and fewer and it just seems like, whenever anything goes wrong it's my fault and I'm, I'm sick of that like I'm sick of being blamed for everything. 

01:21:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I mean, I hear that you're absolutely sick of it. 

01:22:00
SARAH Yeah. 

01:22:00
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, let's go back to this awful fight that you had with him. Tell me a little bit about it so I can get the context because then I'm going to ask you another question after that. 

01:22:10
SARAH Yeah, we were supposed to meet some of his friends at a restaurant it was like seven o'clock at night and I got held at work and I couldn't go and I was trying to call him but I didn't get through or whatever and so I was late and I was you know like an hour and a half late and I could understand like that makes me look bad to his friends I'm sure he was very upset. Umm… and these are people he wants to impress and you know we got home and he just went berserk and just… 

01:22:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Tell me what he said? 

01:22:40
SARAH He just said, he was like, I can't believe you would do this to me like you're so selfish. Everything is about you like, I'm always on your time and I was crying and I was trying to explain like I had to stay at work. My boss, you know needed me and I, I had couldn't leave, I couldn't leave. 

01:23:00
KATHERINE M. HELM So Sarah, in the moment when he's kind of yelling at you and calling you selfish, what did you do? 

01:23:10
SARAH I was bawling all I could do is cry and I, I couldn't find the right words or the words at all to, to tell him that that's not true. I'm not selfish. 

01:23:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

01:23:20
SARAH If anything he's the selfish one… 

01:23:20
KATHERINE M. HELM So you almost felt silenced. 

01:23:25
SARAH Yeah. 

01:23:25
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, like your words were swallowed, you couldn't say anything. 

01:23:25
SARAH That's how I feel every time he gets mad at me. 

01:23:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, every time at a lot. 

01:23:35
SARAH Yeah. Rarely ever do I get to say my piece or my side of the story. 

01:23:40
KATHERINE M. HELM How would you like to do something different. 

01:23:45
SARAH Yeah, yeah, anything. 

01:23:45
KATHERINE M. HELM So you and I have been talking about kind of specific ways of being more assertive uh… standing up for your self. When you're assertive you're not aggressive but you also kind of stand up for yourself or you respect the rights of, of others you know when you're the arguments you're describing to me you feel like your rights are not being respected at all. 

01:24:05
SARAH Right. 

01:24:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Take me back to the fight and tell me what you would have wanted to say? 

01:24:15
SARAH I would have wanted to say I'm sorry, I'm not selfish but I really couldn't leave. I'm never late, I've never disappointed you in this way before. 

01:24:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:24:30
SARAH You know, I wish that you would try to understand that I have a very stressful job. I would never intentionally want to hurt you or embarrass you in front of your friends but, I simply couldn't believe. 

01:24:40
KATHERINE M. HELM How did that feel to do? 

01:24:45
SARAH It felt really good. 

01:24:45
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, you did it really good. 

01:24:45
SARAH Yeah. 

01:24:45
KATHERINE M. HELM I mean, I could see even kind of in your body you know, you were really kind of strong and very clear. you know, it, it looks like you've been practicing some of the things that we've been talking about. So can I get your agreement here uh… the next time there's an argument to do exactly what you just did? 

01:25:05
SARAH I can certainly try… 

01:25:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, tell me what holds you back from doing that? 

01:25:10
SARAH It's, it's scary. 

01:25:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:25:15
SARAH It's just scary to you know, stand up for myself. 

01:25:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure. 

01:25:15
SARAH Uh… I think especially with him it's been my challenge in our relationship, but I mean I'm just fed up to the point where I can't, I can't take this anymore like I, I just, I'm, I'm so angry and frustrated when I'm not even with him anymore. 

01:25:35
KATHERINE M. HELM So I understand that you are angry and frustrated at him. How do you feel when you don't stand up for yourself? 

01:25:40
SARAH Worse. 

01:25:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, so in some ways the kind of feeling inside of you know, kind of being walked over or yelled at and not responding is even worse. 

01:25:45
SARAH Yeah. 

01:25:50
KATHERINE M. HELM So even though I know it's scary to kind of try this new thing where you stand up for yourself umm… maybe we can agree you know, if you think you're ready to try it. You just did an amazing job. 

01:26:00
SARAH You know, I have to try something else because I'm, I'm miserable so… 

01:26:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:26:05
SARAH …yeah, I think that's something I can at least try attempt to do the next time he gets upset. 

01:26:10
KATHERINE M. HELM So on a scale of one to ten, how ready do you feel umm… to try this? 

01:26:15
SARAH I think honestly, like an eight. 

01:26:20
KATHERINE M. HELM That's pretty right. 

01:26:25
SARAH Yeah, I just don't want to be walked all over anymore. 

01:26:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, can you say that again? 

01:26:30
SARAH I don't want to be walked all over anymore. 

01:26:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, you say that like you mean it. 

01:26:30
SARAH Yeah. 

01:26:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, you know so I think this is something that you could try it. It sounds like not only you've been working on it, but when you said that just now, it really sounds like you meant it. I felt it. 

01:26:45
SARAH Yeah. 

01:26:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, umm… why don't we give that a try and see how it goes and you know, no matter how it goes, what kind of take it out and look at it again, but clearly it's in you to do and to do well. 

01:26:55
SARAH Yeah. You know it definitely is. 

01:27:00
KATHERINE M. HELM All right, I can't wait to hear what happens next week. 

01:27:00
SARAH Okay. 

01:27:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON How is this a good example of attaining an agreement or some type of commitment from a client? 

01:27:10
KATHERINE M. HELM I think this is a good example because, you know, she and I really sort of work to break down. Umm… what it is she wants to do differently and maybe even how she wants to do it umm… and she has some reluctance if you notice from the, the clip. 

01:27:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:27:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… she's scared umm… but one of the things, one, one of the ways sort of I solicit her commitment to making this change is because she's very clear things cannot continue as they are. She's emphatic that, she feels that she is being hurt by her boyfriend umm… she is not happy with the way that she is in the relationship and she's clear things have to change. 

01:27:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I noticed that, you kind of joined with her on those kind of feelings and that led to her to kind of begin to kind of think about moving forward in many ways. 

01:28:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I mean, I like the word joined with because at one point I had her go back to the fight that they had. 

01:28:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:28:05
KATHERINE M. HELM And I said you know, if you could do it differently how would you do it? And she sort of looked me right in the eye and very clearly and more importantly very assertively stated exactly what she wanted to say without hesitation and so she was able to do it I think, twice in that clip and so even though she is scared one of the things that came out is not doing it is hurting her more than doing it regardless of what his reaction might be. 

01:28:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that was a powerful moment when she kind of sort of said it was very clear. 

01:28:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes. 

01:28:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I noticed you use a question with a scale like on a scale of one to ten. Why do you do that? What's that about? 

01:28:45
KATHERINE M. HELM I think using scaling questions is a very good way to quickly assess where a client might be uh… in terms of where they are in their change process and I said you know, on a scale of one to ten how committed are you to doing this? Umm… and she said, ‘an eight'. So even though she's scared, she's pretty clear something has to change and I really want to try this. 

01:29:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON yeah, and that seems like that when she said that eight again this idea kind of action towards change like she's really realizing that, that commitment and showing it through her own and her whole body in many ways. 

01:29:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, I think that's a great observation. I saw that too. 

01:29:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Now, let's move on to our final clip which is called paradoxical intentions. 

01:29:30
Assessment Strategies 

01:29:30
Paradoxical Intention 

01:29:30
(and Change) 

01:29:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what exactly is a paradoxical intention? 

01:29:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Paradoxical intent is sort of suggesting to a client that they do the opposites of either what you might want them to do or what they would like to do. 

01:29:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sounds really counterintuitive in many ways to the, to the change process. 

01:29:55
KATHERINE M. HELM It is uh… in many ways but umm… you would sometimes use it if you are sort of sensing a client is resistant or if they're expressing that they want to change but nothing is happening. Umm… it's a strategy that should be used sparingly. 

01:30:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:30:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Or it loses its effectiveness and it should never be done with malintent sort of to prove you are right about something. It's really designed to kind of get the client to sort of really examine umm… where they might not be moving forward towards change. 

01:30:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So sounds like in some ways a client is might, might be stuck so if a counselor kind of sees like maybe clamping stock or not make a lot of movement or kind of maybe stating they want to go but not really making much progress towards that this is when, when you might you might use the center intervention. 

01:30:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Uh… that's exactly right and how do you set this up or know when to do it? So you said, you should use it sparingly when you use it. How do you set it up? 

01:30:50
KATHERINE M. HELM I usually set it up when there's been a pattern of a little to no movement umm… and maybe we haven't sort of been able to find other reasons why. So that you know, the client isn't sort of saying that I'm scared to do this or you know, so they're not other apparent emotional reasons uh… but there's always a reason and so using paradoxical intention which is something unexpected, you don't expect a client doesn't usually expect a counselor to do this. 

01:31:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:31:25
KATHERINE M. HELM Which is, why it can be powerful? Because it's unexpected. 

01:31:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's a kind of asking the client to lean into what they don't want or kind of lean into what they're saying is why they're here in the mean while, right. 

01:31:35
KATHERINE M. HELM I think that's an excellent way of describing it Matt. 

01:31:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in a moment we're going to see role play with you and Kara. I wonder if you could set up this role play, what we're going to see. 

01:31:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Sure, so Kara comes into counseling because she has been in a relationship for about three years and for two of these years she's felt really emotionally disconnected from her boyfriend. Umm… she says that she is really unhappy um, and she says I want to get out of this relationship. 

01:32:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:32:05
KATHERINE M. HELM And so for weeks we've sort of come up with a plan to sort of help her get out of this relationship because that's what she says she wants and it becomes clear that that plan is not working so, I use kind of two skills really. The skill of paradoxical intention as well as the skill of challenge to kind of help her more deeply explore umm… why there's not movement. 

01:32:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:32:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Hi, Kara. 

01:32:30
KARA Hi! How are you? 

01:32:30
KATHERINE M. HELM I'm okay. How things been since we last met? 

01:32:30
KARA They've been good. Umm… you know, not much has changed really and I'm so, Brian. 

01:32:40
KATHERINE M. HELM How's that going? 

01:32:40
KARA It's been going okay. I can't say anything like really exciting has happened. 

01:32:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:32:45
KARA Just been hard to going with the flow. 

01:32:50
KATHERINE M. HELM kind of status quo. 

01:32:50
KARA Yeah. 

01:32:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:32:50
KARA Yeah. 

01:32:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… in some ways I think I, I want to run something by you. 

01:32:55
KARA Okay. 

01:33:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… you know, we've been working together for a couple of months and you came in uh… saying that you know, what you really wanted to do was get out of this relationship with Brian because you're pretty unhappy you know, you told me you haven't been connected with him for, emotionally connect with him for about two years. Is that accurate? 

01:33:15
KARA Yeah, I think you know, for a long time things have just been kind of stagnant in our relationship and yeah, it's just been kind of continuing that way. 

01:33:25
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, you and I talked a lot about kind of ways of sort of uh… talking to him or leaving the relationship and you know, that hasn't been something that you've kind of done yet. 

01:33:35
KARA Yeah. 

01:33:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:33:35
KARA I think, I just still don't really know how to do that or how to bring it up to him and so… I just kind of let it be. 

01:33:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. What would be like for you to stay in this relationship for another year? 

01:33:50
KARA Oh, I don't know, I don't know if I could do that. 

01:33:50
KATHERINE M. HELM You smiled. 

01:33:55
KARA Umm… well, I think it's just kind of funny to think about staying in this relationship for another year, because it's not something that I really want to do. 

01:34:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Tell me what's funny about it? 

01:34:05
KARA Well, I mean I guess just the, the fact that I don't want to be in it and the thought of staying in it another year. 

01:34:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Is kind of a funny. 

01:34:15
KARA Yeah. 

01:34:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, but you've been in it two years and it's kind of felt at least from what you described to me pretty similar. 

01:34:25
KARA Yeah. 

01:34:25
KATHERINE M. HELM So what would it be like to stay in it for another year? 

01:34:30
KARA I mean, I don't think I'd be happy. I think I'd be doing exactly what I'm doing now which is just you know, going through the flow and… 

01:34:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Right. 

01:34:35
KARA It's like taking it day by day. 

01:34:40
[sil.] 

01:34:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Can you see yourself doing that? 

01:34:45
KARA Yes, and no. 

01:34:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Tell me about yes or no. 

01:34:50
KARA You know, the no comes from the part of me that knows that this relationship is not really a happy one for me. It's not productive, it's not helping me… 

01:34:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:35:00
KARA …You know, to become a better person any, in any way but then yes because like you said, I've been in this relationship for three years and two years of it I've been unhappy. 

01:35:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:35:10
KARA So and just doing exactly that just going with the flow and taking it day by day and not really, I guess not really doing anything to change it. 

01:35:20
KATHERINE M. HELM But you can't see yourself staying in it for another year. What about six months? And what do you think I'm doing here? 

01:35:30
KARA Kind of trying to point out to me that maybe, I really haven't, I guess, I just I really haven't done anything. 

01:35:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:35:35
KARA To make changes and it's kind of like the behavior of mine to just what things happen and hope they work out on their own but it's obviously not working. 

01:35:45
KATHERINE M. HELM All while you're miserable. 

01:35:50
KARA Right. 

01:35:50
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:35:50
KARA Yeah. 

01:35:50
KATHERINE M. HELM So you know, not making a decision is really making a decision and that's okay. You know. it's okay if you decide you don't want to go because, maybe part of you really likes being in a relationship you know, the security of being in a relationship even if it's not with Brian. You know, does that fit for you at all? 

01:36:10
KARA Yeah, I mean I think I'm just so comfortable with how things are now. 

01:36:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:36:15
KARA You know, like you've been saying I've been doing this for two years. 

01:36:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Right. 

01:36:20
KARA So that's a long time to just have learned this behavior so, it's like it's just comfortable to keep doing this. 

01:36:25
KATHERINE M. HELM And maybe scary to think about actually, really leaving the relationship not just talking about it. 

01:36:35
KARA Yeah. 

01:36:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:36:35
KARA Yeah, definitely. 

01:36:35
KATHERINE M. HELM Do you think, maybe you're not ready to leave it? 

01:36:40
KARA I think maybe there is parts of me that feel like I'm ready and then parts of me that feel like, I'm really not. 

01:36:45
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, so part of you maybe feels like you should leave. 

01:36:50
KARA Uh-huh. 

01:36:50
KATHERINE M. HELM You know or should leave. 

01:36:50
KARA Right. 

01:36:55
KATHERINE M. HELM And then part of you is not ready to leave. 

01:36:55
KARA Yeah. 

01:36:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:36:55
KARA I think, you're like, like you're saying there's a part of me that knows this isn't helpful to me growing as a person, growing professionally. 

01:37:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:37:05
KARA I just kind of, just stayed in this one place but then part of me maybe kind of likes that one place and… 

01:37:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:37:10
KARA …and made my (inaudible ) that's there and I don't really want to get out of it. 

01:37:15
KATHERINE M. HELM What would it be like, if you remove the pressure for yourself that you have to leave? 

01:37:20
KARA I think I might feel more, more comfortable and maybe I wouldn't feel so… like guilty when I come back in here every week and say that nothing's changed. 

01:37:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. Can we talk a little bit about your guilt? 

01:37:35
KARA Uh-huh. 

01:37:35
KATHERINE M. HELM That's kind of what I was picking up for, from you. 

01:37:35
KARA yeah. 

01:37:40
KATHERINE M. HELM And this would be the last place I would want you to feel guilt… 

01:37:40
KARA Yeah. 

01:37:45
KATHERINE M. HELM …or that I'm judging you. Umm… so I'm glad that we're talking about this today because, I think it's important to do what you feel like you need to do now. What would you like to do? 

01:37:55
KARA I think really, talk about it more if I really am ready for this… 

01:38:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:38:00
KARA …and if I, if I were to do it, what would you know, life after this relationship look like. 

01:38:05
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. Without necessarily having to make the commitment… 

01:38:10
KARA Yeah. 

01:38:10
KATHERINE M. HELM …to actually leave it. 

01:38:10
KARA Yeah, I think that would be really helpful because that, I think that's a thought that feels really scary to me of what is life after this going to be like? 

01:38:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Okay, maybe we could spend some time in our next sessions processing your fear or your reluctance. I think sometimes when we have reluctance about something, it's important to understand what it's about? 

01:38:30
KARA Yeah, definitely. 

01:38:30
KATHERINE M. HELM I'm glad we have this conversation today. 

01:38:35
KARA Me too. Thank you. 

01:38:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of these of a paradoxical intention or challenge? 

01:38:40
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah, I think it's a good example of both. 

01:38:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Tell me more about why? What did you see? 

01:38:50
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, in the clip, the client looks kind of like, "what?" You know, so what I say you know, uh, what would it be like for you to stay in this relationship for another year? 

01:38:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that was the powerful question that was the kind of the, the curveball. 

01:39:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah because she sort of looks at me like, "what are you talking about, I really want to get out of this relationship and through further exploration." Umm… you know, she even kind of catches me out a bit because, she knows what I'm about to say, we sort of had this exchange with our kind of our facial expressions and I say you know, you know what I'm going to say. Umm… but she says. "I don't want to stay in this for a year" but, she comes to the conclusion herself through my kind of encouraging her to stay in the relationship for a year or at least explore what that might like… 

01:39:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:39:30
KATHERINE M. HELM …that you know, the past two years have already looked like this. Right, so staying in a relationship for another year isn't such a crazy idea? 

01:39:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:39:40
KATHERINE M. HELM And you know Matt, I should say it's not that I'm asking or wanting her to stay in the relationship for another year but, it's that I want her to explore umm… why she hasn't made movements towards getting out. 

01:39:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in some ways it sounds like, you're again, you kind of flipping the lens for a moment. 

01:39:55
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:40:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Which hasn't, she's been looking at this one way. 

01:40:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Right. 

01:40:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON until nearly you're asking her now to look at it differently and see kind of what that feels like. 

01:40:05
KATHERINE M. HELM I. I like that expression kind of flipping the lens. 

01:40:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:40:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Umm… because you know, that was sort of what I was hoping to do. 

01:40:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And but you challenged her too. You're challenging her and I wonder how you think challenge is part of the change process/ 

01:40:15
KATHERINE M. HELM I think that you know, different theories say different things about the change process so, certain theories would not be fond of the skill of challenge. 

01:40:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

01:40:25
KATHERINE M. HELM But again, I think sometimes our thoughts and our behaviors or our feelings and our thoughts they, they differ and so the scale of challenge, which I think sometimes students uh… feel like it's a confrontation but it's really not. It's, you're getting a client to look at their own in consistencies and every human being I know has in consistencies and so in counseling that skill and especially in the change process is getting the client to kind of look deeper and, and sort of notice these differences and how it might be holding them back. 

01:41:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know I noticed that that you used to work on a challenge and I think you're right knowing kind of what you talk about in your view and how you like the work. That's not, you know, that confrontation is not a mean confrontation. 

01:41:10
KATHERINE M. HELM Right. 

01:41:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, on a mean challenge or even some ways a risky challenge, so I think it comes from a place in which you're clearly with her. 

01:41:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes, and I think that it's, it's grounded in the relationship and so… you know, if you form a good relationship with a client and you trust that relationship umm… this skill of challenge and this kind of using paradoxical intentions are not negatively viewed by the client but again, you have to have a good relationship and those skills should be used uh… depending on the client somewhat sparingly. 

01:41:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, in, in this, this program we've seen a variety of skills that you've kind of used and it seems in many ways this fits right along the other ones in terms of the variety, the ray of kind of things that a counselor can use when they're trying to motivate kind of change in action. 

01:42:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah and you know, from this clip what did we find out, we found out she's not ready… 

01:42:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ready. 

01:42:05
KATHERINE M. HELM You know, she thought she was ready, really, she thought she should be ready but kind of in looking at you know, maybe I just don't want to leave this relationship yet which is legitimate to me. 

01:42:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I think that's unique because I think what we've seen in all the clips you've done which is, it's not as easy as just doing intervention. 

01:42:20
KATHERINE M. HELM Right. 

01:42:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, there's pieces to this the kind of circle back the, there are many ways support each other. Right, in the process of changes is not just one thing you can do. 

01:42:30
KATHERINE M. HELM Yes and one thing I would hope that umm… the audience gets out of these clips is, I'm not overly invested in the client's change or sort of un invested. 

01:42:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right, right.

KATHERINE M. HELM You know, umm… this client came to counseling because she wanted to get out of a relationship and she discovered, "maybe I don't" and I want to support where the client is at. 

01:42:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, seems to me that you invested in the client. 

01:42:50
KATHERINE M. HELM I, I hope so, definitely. 

01:42:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Well Katherine, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and your knowledge and your skills… 

01:43:00
KATHERINE M. HELM Thank you for having me. 

01:43:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …and the way that you talk about them and then you embody them because I think it's easier to kind of see what these look like in reality as it opposes like an intervention on a page or something you read, you realize that a lot of these skills all, all come together. 

01:43:15
KATHERINE M. HELM Yeah. 

01:43:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And it really is again going back to that that sphere of the counselor and the person of the counselor that makes them unique.
