 Good afternoon.

ROBERT T. CARTER  Thank you for staying to the bitter end of the conference for another to the final talks.

Recognizing and Assessing Race-Based Traumatic Stress Injury Robert T. Carter, Ph.D Teachers College Columbia University A Workshop Conducted at the Diversity Challenge Conference Boston College Chestnut Hill, MA October 22, 2005 

00:00:40
ROBERT T. CARTER  Uhm, my fantasy was that I would just give this talk to myself. And then everyone would be dashing home. So I appreciate that you chose to stay and hear what I have to share with you about recognizing and assessing race-based traumatic stress. (clear throat) What I'm, what I was told was that this is supposed to be a workshop, so part of the time, I'm going to talk you and part of the time I hope to have an interaction with you around some case examples that I have towards the end but during the course of the time that I will be talking to you I'm going to try to provide with a context for understanding the existence of race-based traumatic stress. 

00:01:35
Conceptual Foundation Today I will introduce several sets of issues that serve as the foundation for the workshop on how to recognize and assess race-based traumatic stress. a. I will provide a context for the existence of race-based traumatic stress - Racism in our society affects people on individual institutional, and cultural levels. b. I will present a brief review of the psychological literature that shows how racism is a stressor and as such affects mental health. c. I will discus stress and trauma in order to understand how they apply to racism. d. I will deconstruct racism by offering distinct definitions racism as a way to gain a better grasp of the mental health impact. e. I will then define and offer a way to assess race-based traumatic stress. d. I will present case material for discussion. 

00:01:35
ROBERT T. CARTER  Uhm, and then provide you with a brief review of the psychological literature that I think demonstrates that racism is a stressor and as a consequence affects mental health and then I think its important to then talk about the relationship between stress and trauma or the distinctions between stress and trauma and then I'm gonna deconstruct racism so that's it's, uhm, more fine tuned definitions that help us understand and follow the impact of racism on one's mental health. I'm gonna then follow that with my definition of race-based traumatic stress injury and then present some case examples for us to talk about and during the case studies I'd like us to talk about what, what are the elements of race-based traumatic stress in the, in the cases that I'll present to you. Now it seem evident and it probably seems evident to most of you that racism is a fairly prevalent phenomenon in the society but I don't know that it's generally prevalent or generally recognized but we continue to see reports of racial profiling and police aggression towards Black and Latino men and women. We continue to see reports of lawsuits with respect to racial discrimination in various kinds of organizations and agencies eh, how many of you knew about this GMAC settlement ah, for car dealers discriminating against people of color in setting interest rates? One or two of you, okay. This is a major lawsuit that went on for a long time and which this, this practice was uncovered and they finally settled out of court. When people encounter, what I'm gonna call racism in the form of some kind of discrimination or harassment they have two, essentially two options, they can seek legal counsel for redress and then if, and if you seek legal counsel then it's likely that the lawyer if he thinks you have a case to pursue will have you consult with him and a health professional. 

00:04:25
ROBERT T. CARTER  The other option a person has is that they can just simply go directly to a mental health professional for relief from the stress that the, they encounter with racism produced. Either way if you go to a lawyer, the lawyer is going to rely on Federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race and other group memberships. And most of you know that these laws were established in the 1964, 1991 but I've observed that these laws, while they have translated for some group memberships into organizational policies and procedures with respect to race related discrimination, they have not translated or been transformed into clear organizational policies and procedures. So if we look at the fact that there are clear guidelines in almost all institutions and organizations with respect to sexual harassment and there are particular guidelines and policies and procedures that one follows or is, uhm, ah, that, that are outlined in those regulations. So it's defined, there's a clear procedure for filing a complaint, there's a clear process for the complaint to be processed and handled and so on and this is true in most professions, institutions and organizations but I have been hard pressed to find any such kind of policy or procedure for racial harassment. There is usually a general uhm, anti-discrimination statement for most organizations but there are no clearly articulated procedures outlined for that. Now why is that curious, I think it's curious because in 1972 the courts in the United States first recognized a hostile environment as of, as occurring as, on the basis of racial hostility and it was a decade later in 1982 when the first hostile environment with respect to sexual harassment was recognized by the courts. So initially, hostile environments or harassment were recognized by the courts on the basis of race not sex but as we look around today we have clear policies about sexual harassment and we have hardly any about racial harassment, so I, I think that's curious. Uhm, perhaps one reason is that when we try to understand what we are, mean by experiences of racism it's hard to get a clear definition or a clear handle on what is that we're talking about. Uhm, Jones' book on prejudice and discrimination identified some 18 to 20 types of definitions of racism that were offered by various scholars and so they have some common elements associated which that, with the definitions but in general there's just lots of, what I call shades of grey or shifting meanings associated with what people mean by racism. When I refer to racism I'm generally talking about individual, institutional and cultural practices that are used by the group in power to maintain inferior status of non-group members or non-dominant group members and so we know that in United States the group in power are whites and the people who are not, non-dominant are generally people of color and as a consequence they have less power. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:08:45
ROBERT T. CARTER  Now with regard to racism there's also confusion with the notion of prejudice, people seem to equate prejudice and racism and, uhm, this is I think clearly a mistake because I don't think that victims of racism can be racist, uhm, by its very definition. So to prejudge someone and to have a system of racism or to be racist are distinct and different things they're not the same things. More importantly, if we look about, at how discrimination or racism is defined in the law we, we see that racism in the law is identified in the basis of or within the context of discrimination and generally refers to a group being treated differently on the basis of a protected cat, category or characteristic, in this case race and in the law it's called disparate impact and for an individual in the law it's called disparate treatment, when someone is treated differently on the basis of his or her race. You know I, I raise this because remember there were two avenues of redress, you can file a lawsuit or you can go talk to a mental health professional, do you remember that? Okay, so if you file a lawsuit, if you and your group of your co-workers was subjected to some sort of discrimination, you as the plaintiff has to show that the disparate treatment or disparate impact that you suffered was intentional and you have to show that it was specific to your race that the actions taken towards you were not taken for some other reasons. So if the defendant can argue that there was a business reason for the actions taken then he or she might prevail or the organization might prevail in a legal ah, battle over what took place. Hmm, what I want you to understand here is that there's a heavy burden to try to prove someone intentionally discriminated against you on the basis of your race. 

00:11:15
ROBERT T. CARTER  And so the legal avenues of redress I think have been limited by the way that these issues have been handled in, by the court and in the law, be that as it may I believe that people who suffer racial injustice or who are subjected to racism are also suffer psychological harm in the form of stress and other kinds of symptoms. I also think that it's hard to know how to track what happens to people when we use broad constructs like racism, in part because it's broad and indistinct and it's sort of hard to sort of, know what it is that people are talking about uhm, when they use such language. So I, I've advocated for distinguishing between types of experiences people have by unpacking racism and defining racism in a more concrete way by using racial discrimination and harassment as, as specific types of racism and I'm gonna talk about these definitions ah, a little later on. But I think that these process of unpacking racism and giving its specific definition to track the mental health impact is a more useful strategy than trying to address uhm, impact of, of racism using broad definitions and categories. I think it helps people who are subjected to racist events understand what's happened to them when they can't connect it to particular kinds of experiences and I think it gives researchers and scholars, uhm, a better opportunity to be able to ah, track the impact of racism on its targets. So if racism causes stress and psychological injury then it falls within the sort of category of stress in mental health where we actually know quite a bit and there's a fairly large body of research around stress and its mental health effects and there's a fairly accepted recognition both among lay people and professionals that, that stress is harmful to both to one's mental health and to one's physical health. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:50
ROBERT T. CARTER  We recognized that people are harmed by natural disasters, of criminal assaults and accidents and these events or life events produces stress. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:10
ROBERT T. CARTER  It's also been acknowledged that stressful life events sometimes can rise to the level of being traumatic. 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:20
ROBERT T. CARTER  Researchers who have looked at stress have been able to establish that it occurs or it, it increases when the area that one is experiencing the stress is a central role in one's life. So if it involves personal relationships or pare, parenting relationships or it involves work relationships then the level of stress that one is likely to experience can be very high. It's also been established that if an event is ambiguous, negative, unpredictable and uncontrollable that these are components of, of experiences that can heighten the stressfulness of it. And that these stressful events have uhm, harmful mental health impact and the last piece of information that comes from the stress literature that I think is extremely important to keep in mind is that whether or not the stressor is objective or subjective they still predict psychological and health effects. So it doesn't matter whether you were hit by a car or loss someone or whether you thought something happened to you that you experienced or attributed as being stressful. Either way whether it's subjective or objective both predicts psychological and health effects in the large literature on stress. So we know then that stress plays essential role in many areas of life that it, it is associated with depression and anxiety as common reactions to life events that are stressful. The kinds of life events that have been acknowledged as being stressful are being discriminated against living in poverty, being unemployed, et cetera. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:40
ROBERT T. CARTER  But if we wanna understand how people experience trauma we need to look to another body of literature because the people who study stressful life events typically don't study trauma and moreover the people who study stressful life events also do not study race related stressful life events. So we have to shift now to another body of literature that looks at, uhm, trau, traumatic experiences and traumatic experiences or extreme stress reactions can be, fall within uhm, a couple of bodies of literature. One is uhm, emphasis on PTSD or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Acute Stress Reactions and those kinds of, in similar DSM kinds of categories or criteria. And for most of these the primary criteria for establishing the existence of such a reaction is some kind of physical threat to one's life, okay. The other way we can understand severe stress reactions is, are contained in what's called "Traumatic stress literature." Here, the primary criteria for the event being stressful is emotional impact or pain, not physical threat. 

00:18:15
ROBERT T. CARTER  For something to be traumatic in this sense or for traumatic stress to exist, the event needs to be negative, it needs to cause emotional pain, it also should be sudden and uncontrollable and then there are certain reactions that are associated with or distinguished a stress reaction from a traumatic stress reaction. I think that traumatic stress is a useful construct to use in trying to understand race related experiences. So some of the core things that have to happen for a reaction to be categorized as stressful, I'm sorry, as traumatic is that it needs to be associated with symptoms of intrusion or re-experiencing the needs to be associated with arousal or hyperactivity and or avoidance and numbing. So that these, these constellation of reactions or symptoms or signs are associated with events or reactions that are traumatic and intrusive, uhm, intrusion symptoms involve things like not being to sleep, inability to concentrate, having nightmares or flashbacks which flashbacks can occur during the day not at night ah, and, and having intrusive thoughts or images and that the, the avoidance and numbing ah, symptoms cluster involves less memory for the event, uhm, emotional numbing or separating one self from what took place. And, and essentially psychological and emotional strategies that tries to distance one self from what occurred; while arousal has to do with feelings of anxiety and anger and startles responses that are being irritable uhm, and aggression or hyperactivity. Now what's important to remember about this symptom consolation for trauma is that they can be expressed through thoughts, emotions, behaviors and physiological reactions and/or combinations of tho(ph), of those. So that there is no particular modality in which these symptoms may manifest themselves. They can manifest themselves across a number of different modalities, okay? So, in addition to this symptom cluster, in addition to them being expressed through various modalities as in thoughts and emotions and behaviors and physiological reactions, traumatic signs and symptoms can also be seen in what some scholars call "secondary related responses" but I don't know that I would call them that, but I think what I would say is that one can be depressed, have low self esteem, have identity confusion, have problems within the personal relationships, feel a strong sense of sham(ph), shame and guilt and all of those can be also associated with the traumatic reaction that they're having. And so the traumatic reaction can be expressed through a range of different kinds of signs and symptoms and through different modalities. And, and I want you to keep that in mind when we get to the cases, okay? So what do we know about trauma from research? There are three bodies of literature that can tell us about ah, trauma-related reactions or, one is the research on war veterans who have been subjected to potentially stressful experiences in combat. There have been studies of the general population ah, on, the impact of stressful life events like natural disasters, interpersonal violence or mass violence and things of that nature, and then there's a third set of uhm, research that has to do with ah, studies involving racism and race related stress and discrimination. (coughs) So, I'm just really gonna walk to this research really quickly just to give you a flavor of why I think this tells us something important about race related experiences. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:00
ROBERT T. CARTER  Studies of veterans and citizens uhm, that have looked at PTSD rates, have found that uhm, for a Vietnam, Vietnamese veterans, that 21 percent of them who were Black, had PTSD, and 28 percent of them who are, who are Hispanic had PTSD symptoms versus 14 percent of whites. And keep in mind that they were all on the same war zones, okay? So we, we see here elevated rates of PTSD in veterans of color, in comparison to whites. Also, people who have looked at reactions to a ah, natural disasters have also found differential rates of the development of PTSD, where for whites, the rate was 15 percent, for ah, Latinos who spoke Spanish it was 38 percent, and Blacks it was 23 percent. Again we see elevated rates of development of PTSD in reaction to a similar event. And there was one study by Lou(ph) and her colleagues that looked at whether or not, race related stress was associated with the elevated levels of PTSD in Asian American Vietnamese veterans. And she's found, they found, first of all that the rate for, for the development of PTSD in Asian American Vietnamese veterans was 37 percent, far beyond the 14 percent of Whites, and, but more importantly they found that race related stress, over and above, other variables that are typically examined in these studies, predicted PTSD. So that the race related stress as component that were never examined in other studies, and this study, found that it was a much stronger predictor of the development of PTSD in Asian American veterans. In studies of racism and discrimination, it's been found that, ah, discrimination compromises physical and mental health. That Black men tend to have higher levels of chronic and acute experiences of discrimination than women, that uhm, people of color who experience cultural racism as a stressor, the(ph), that experience is related to lower levels of quality of life, and that Blacks and uhm, experience individual and cultural related racism at about an equal rate to Asians uhm, who also experience a fair amount of institutional race related stress. And Conniff(ph) and Landry(ph) found that 96 percent of Black respondents were stressed by an experience of racial discrimination and Sellers(ph) and Shelton found that frequent experiences of discrimination were related to negative psychological outcomes and racial identity was found to moderate the negative effects. So what is the summary of this literature tell us? First of all, when people are exposed to stressful or potentially traumatic life experiences, only about 5 to 10 percent of them develop PTSD symptoms. What we've seen here is that both for veterans and citizens of color, the rates of the development of PTSD exceeds that, that of average level, and much of the elevated levels in people of color are not explained by simple exposure to the event. 

00:27:00
ROBERT CARTER We also know that there are physical outcomes or impacts like high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, as well as psychological and emotional impacts, as it relates to race related stress experiences. So I think that these studies provide indirect evidence to PTSD studies, because the PTSD studies were not studies that involve race or racism but I do think that they provide indirect evidence and the discrimination studies I think, provides direct evidence of the impact of racism but I, as I said just a moment ago, PTSD research didn't focus on race, and discrimination studies did not, and typically don't investigate whether racism produces traumatic stress. What they do show is that they produce stress but they don't investigate whether the stress rises to the level of being traumatic. So I think there needs to, we need a way to get at whether or not race related experiences are traumatic, and I think the way that I wanna get at that is by deconstructing racism into specific types of experiences. I do also think that the evidence shows that something is occurring in the lives of people of color, that's not being evaluated or assessed by researchers, that's causing them to have elevated levels of posttraumatic stress or psychological symptoms. I believe, and so do the researchers believe that that has to do with what they call neglect, being marginalized and things of that nature. So they implicate race and racism as potential explanatory factors for the elevated levels of PTSD and PTSD related research. Discrimination researchers or race related stress researchers are showing that people who experience racism are stressed by those experiences. What they don't do is show whether or not that stress is associated with trauma. So, I think that, to, to connect traumatic reactions to racism, it's necessary to unpack racism, and then in a preliminary study uhm, where I did some of these, I did find that, by deconstructing racism and separating the kinds of experiences out, that people who experience race hostility had greater lasting mental health effects, than people who'd simply reported racial avoidance. Uhm, I'll explain what I mean by that in a moment. So the rationale for unpacking racism is to reduce some of the ambiguity associated by the various kinds of race related experiences. If we think about the race related experiences that one might have, you could by stopped by the police because of your race. I would call that, harassment. You could be ignored by a salesperson in the store, or be denied housing. I would call that discrimination, where there's avoidance occurring in your interactions. If you weren't promoted or you had your professional abilities or skills questioned, when you were given access, I have come to call that discriminatory harassment, and I'm gonna define these terms in more detail. Now, uhm, so discrimination is what, what I'm calling discrimination is actually aversive or avoidant racism in which the objective is to maintain distance or minimize contact with non-dominant group members. Discrimination helps dominant group members engage in racism without appearing to do so, by simply keeping their distance and staying away. It can occur, or avoiding racism can occur at the individual level, at the system or institutional level, as well at the policy and the cultural level. Harassment, on the other hand, is a form of hostile racism, that involves actions and strategies whose purpose is to communicate or to make clear the subordinate or inferior status of, that the person holds due to his or her race, with non-dominant group status, group membership. Generally the harassment is hostile, and generally it occurs with some kind of sanction or acceptance on the part of institutional members for engaging in these practices. We're, we're also introducing the notion of quid pro quo racial harassment. Now, these are not legal distinctions because as I indicated to you before, racial harassment is a part of or subset of racial discrimination in the law. So there is no separate distinction in the law that, that, that distinguishes harassment from discrimination. Both are uhm, ah, are treated as a similar kind of experience that uhm, the same kinds of legal principles applied to both experiences but there is quid pro quo sexual harassment in which pretty much now that that has to do with sexual favors in exchange for uhm, some kind of ah, benefit in the workplace, but there's been hardly no recognition for the fact that there is also, quid pro quo racial harassment, in which one has to exchange acknowledging race related experiences that occur in the workplace, to be able to stay in the workplace. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:45
ROBERT CARTER  It's important I think, to recognize that both contain a threat, where one, the threat has to do with sexual relationships and the other the threat has to do with not acknowledging the kinds of race or racism that goes on. So that in quid pro quo racial harassment, you're actually granting the favor of ignoring racism in the work setting. This race, racially based harassment can be physical, interpersonal, verbal. It can be contained in assumptions about your trustworthiness, or it can be contained in behavior that operates on, on the, on a, on questioned assumptions of racial stereotypes, or by assuming that you're dangerous or criminal. Now, when I started out with this work, we only had these, these two distinctions, which was racial discrimination and racial harassment but as I have gone to do some research in this area, we encountered experiences that could not be grouped in either strictly discrimination or strictly racial harassment. So I'm introducing this third category that I'm calling "discriminatory harassment" that is aversive, hostile racism uhm, that this is I think what happens in, in aversion you're not led in to this setting or you're, you're avoided. I think discriminatory harassment happens when you are in the setting. You've gained access but now you're going to be treated differently than other people in the setting and that different treatment is going to be tinged with hostility, okay? Do, do you understand the distinction that I'm making? Talk to me. Please talk to me. 

00:35:55
 (inaudible ) 

00:35:57
ROBERT CARTER Thank you, all right. 'Coz I'm going on and fall asleep up here, if you don't react, okay. All right. (coughs) And, and I think that this kind of harassment occurs because racist or well intentioned people, still harbor negative feelings, toward people of color and these feelings are expressed in this subtle, indirect and rationalized ways. These are the folks who will say that they're really not interacting with you, on the basis of your race but they still treat you in ways that reflect negative, hostile, racial beliefs. Okay, so we've unpacked racism into discrimination, harassment and discriminatory harassment. We've established that there may be some trauma, that occurs as a consequence of these experiences but if we follow the DSM criteria, where that leads us is to acknowledging that what happens to people as a consequence of racism, is that they are disordered, and I don't think that's an accurate way to describe what happens to them. I think it's more accurate to discuss the impact of racism as injury and rather than as a mental disorder or as a disorder. The reason that I make this argument is that, mental disorders generally are something, are things that are inter-psychic or intrapersonal. They are not necessarily things that come from the environment. Racism is an assault that comes from the environment, and as a consequence is situational, not dispositional. If we contend that someone has posttraumatic stress disorder, as a result of race related experiences, we have taken the, the social cultural environmental assault, and put it inside the person, as a dispositional factor. I think that's a mistake, because it shifts the emphasis of what happened, and I think it tends to also minimize the impact of racism, or the existence of it. So, I'm proposing that we talk about the, the impact of racism as injury, and in a moment we'll talk, see the differences in the definitions. This is not to say that racism does not create damage to one's psychic and personality. I think that it does, in the same way that being held captive, can cause, or being, being tortured, can cause emotional and psychological damage. I think it does cause that damage, but I, I, I cringe at the thought of saying that someone who's seeking mental health uhm, assistance from me that I have to diagnose them as having some kind of disorder because someone did something to them. So, I have a problem with that and, well, and, and if we think about the definitions, to injure means to harm or impair, or to give pain to. Injury is defined as an acted damages or hurts, and is a violation of another's right, for which the law allows an action to recover damages. While to be disordered, is an abnormal physical or mental condition, where one is not functioning in normal, healthy orderly way. I think that the notion of injury is a more powerful notion associated with race related traumatic experiences than is disorder. Now, when I started this work, I actually thought about this as a disorder. I initially wrote about this as race based traumatic stress disorder. Now, I've come to think about it as race based traumatic stress injury because the injury suggests that you have been hurt and you have been violated in a way in which you should not have been that you had a right not to be violated and you should have a right to recover damages for that violation. 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:50
ROBERT CARTER  Now, some of these signs and symptoms that are associated with PTSD are also associated with race based traumatic stress so there's some overlap. So, if, if I'm arguing that you need to show signs of intrusion, arousal and avoidance, those are also signs and symptoms that are necessary for diagnosis of PTSD. If you are familiar with the DSM, you would know, you know that. So that's the overlap but I also know that PTSD criteria is also very rigid. You have to meet several subcategories. There are about six criteria that one has to meet to ah, have a full diagnosis of PTSD and within each of those six criteria, there are other criteria that also have to be met and I'm gonna spare you the details of that but it's just to say that, that using that as a way to understand racial, race related experiences, I think would be a mistake and as I said earlier, because I think it minimizes the impact of racism also because the DSM criteria does not match the experiences of racism. While it's true that some experiences of racism may be sudden and unexpected, it's also true that many experiences of racism in the form of discrimination and harassment and discriminary(ph) harr, discriminatory harassment may also be on-going and chronic and that doesn't fit DSM criteria. Another thing that doesn't fit the criteria is that the kinds of racial aversion or hostility can also be communicated indirectly by use of symbols and coded languages or coded actions and those are not captured by DSM criteria but that, that's a way in which one can experience racism. Uhm that, that doesn't allow you to use DSM criteria because it doesn't consider these kinds of indirect uhm, forms of communication. 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:25
ROBERT CARTER  Lastly, it is not, it is the case that most Americans do not understand the subtle and symbolic threats associated race in the society. In a previous talk I gave, I, I reported on the study about perceptions of the criminal justice system. And, and in this study, 80 percent of the Black participants in the study thought that they had a high probability of being stopped by the police, of being jailed and being sentenced to death. Ninety-five percent of the white participants in the study thought that the criminal justice system was fair and equal. In most studies that look at perceptions of various kinds of system show a distinct racial divide. What that suggest to me is that not everyone is capable of understanding the subtle and symbolic threats associated with race and racism in our society. Since whites don't, are not subjected to some of these threats, they may use them subconsciously. They may not recognize them if it's occurring in their presence. And so I think that you, you cannot have criteria that is only available to some portions of the population being used for generic kind of diagnostic system. Lastly, I would contend further that people have learned to be politically correct and they know what to say and how to say it to mask things that may be associated with racism. And I think those things make it more difficult to be able to unearth what may be really occurring in a situation. Now, the idea that, that racism is associated with traumatic reactions as not new uhm, Lou(ph) stated that stressful events have exposure to combat and racism could be additive and that cumulative racism can be experienced as traumatic. Ah, Shurfield(ph) and Maki(ph) argued that exposure to race related trauma in and of itself may be the primary factor in the development and, of, and adjustment or a stress disorder. Race related stressors have been thought to be environmental in nature and includes structural consequences such as trauma and work related experiences but they also vary in severity, frequency, onset and in one's reaction and manner of coping. Thus, how one copes and reacts as well as the severity and frequency and type of exposure should be considered in assessing racial trauma since the outcomes or reactions can be both positive and negative. So, unlike PTSD, I'm, I'm not familiar with a positive post traumatic stress reaction ah, but people who have been subjected to race related experiences have turned those experiences into positive actions that have facilitated and enhanced their lives. So, it is not a simple matter of seeing this as something that one's reaction is always gonna be just something negative. Uhm, also, other scholars who have put forward the idea of race related experience as being traumatic have done so using the rubric of post traumatic stress disorder and I'm not actually proposing to use that same rubric in the way that they have proposed using it. I'm actually arguing for a non-pathological way to think about race based traumatic stress injury. And in this way, I'm contending that it is emotional pain or threat of emotional pain and or physical pain, that results from racial harassment or some active hostility, racial discrimination, some active avoidance or discriminatory harassments, some kind of aversive hostility. The events can be direct, subtle or ambiguous. They can be individual, systemic or, or, and/or systemic, and/or communicated through symbols and through ah, coded language. They can be severe, moderate or just accumulation of these daily slides or micro-aggressions. I think that what distinguishes race based traumatic stress injury from other kinds of race related stress is that it produces a memorable event that has lasting effect, whether the event is singular or cumulative. I think the distinguishing feature is the lasting effect of the event. And so some would argue that physical attacks are the most severe form of race based trauma. I, I don't, I don't subscribe to that view. I think that uhm, that, that it's heinous and can be certainly traumatic but I don't think it's the only or the, the most traumatic form of being subjected to racism. If we are trying to assess race based traumatic stress injury then we need to consider the strength and intensity of the person's reaction and the symptom cluster that emerges from that reaction. 

00:49:35
[sil.] 

00:49:35
ROBERT CARTER  We have to keep in mind that the severity that the person's reaction reflects could also be a, a reflection of cumulative or numerous events. So to be present, one must have perceived the race related event as negative, sudden and uncontrollable. One must have experiences of arousal, intrusion and avoidance manifested in any of the modalities that we've talked about. And they also can be expressed through low self-esteem, shame and guilt, depression, et cetera. So, one can present primarily as being depressed and in fact, the depression is the way in which they're reacting to the race based traumatic injury. Okay? Or, one can be physically ill and the physical illness can be a manifestation of the race based traumatic stress injury. Okay? One can develop a particular way of thinking about things. And that way of thinking about things could be the manifestation of race based traumatic stress injury because it's manifesting itself in cognitive processes. (coughs) 

00:51:05
[sil.] 

00:51:05
ROBERT CARTER  I think that the, the, that, that race based traumatic stress but(ph) is leave wounds. What is that? (laughs) I actually wrote this, huh. I don't know what that means uhm, leaves wounds that can be difficult to heal and, and I think the way to think about it is that it's a wound that isn't, doesn't heal. It's a, sort of a wound that's continuous, that, that, that doesn't heal itself. But at the same time, it's also unique to the individual in the way that that person copes with things. And therefore, it varies from person to person so they could, there is no prescription about how to recognize this except to look for these various core signs and symptoms. You have to see the signs and symptoms in the context of the person's way of being at how they cope and their racial identity status as well because they're going to be less consciously aware of the impact if they haven't evolved ah, a racial identity status that's ah, differentiated enough for them to know that they had a race based experience but it doesn't mean that they can't be subjected to having race based traumatic stress even if they weren't aware that that's what it was. If they were operating at a lower level of racial development, they can still be impacted by this. They would just make attributions about the experience that wouldn't be associated with the, this situation or event. They would make it more dispositional. So, as I said, it shows signs of intrusion uhm, that can be cumulative and, and I think of, of, of the, of the event that might trigger something moving from being stressful to being traumatic as what I call the last straw event. So, imagine that the person has been going through life that have these experiences and that's cumulative but I think something happens that serves as a trigger or last straw event that moves the stress to the level of being trauma. 

00:53:30
[sil.] 

00:53:30
ROBERT CARTER  I think a way that we might see manifestations of some of this traumatic stress injury is through, through one's relationships and whether those relationships have been stable or whether they are strained on a regular basis or not. The other kinds of things that the person nod, ah, experience and not, may not be terribly conscious of, it's just being uncomfortable, just a, a sense of discomfort as reflected in having a, sort of a knot in one's stomach but this doesn't go away. That whenever they enter the area or arena where the event occurred they just have this feeling of dis-ease and that, that level of discomfort intensifies or diminishes but it's constant for them in some way. 

00:54:35
[sil.] 

00:54:35
ROBERT CARTER  So, remember that, that being, having a traumatic experience by definition means that something happened to you that was deeply painful and it was so painful that you try not to relive the event. At the same time, the event continues to present itself to you because you can't let it go. So you work, you are working on the one hand to avoid it and the pain that it causes and the, the other hand because of the nature and, and power of the event, it continues to come back in various ways and shapes and forms. And so what I think the trauma creates is this pervasive feeling of vulnerability. 

00:55:35
[sil.] 

00:55:35
ROBERT CARTER  And I said all this stuff before. If we think about the fact that there is a lot of pressure to deny the existence of race in the society in the events on our lives. (coughs) It means that the person is often left, not only vulnerable but also left to wonder about what he or she did to bring this experience on. He or she is left to struggle with how race is affecting their lives at the same time, that race is continually and constantly denied as an important part of one's life. And so, you are engaged in this juggling act of knowing that race is an important part of your life and at the same time, trying to push that awareness away because to be aware of it means that you're going to experience the pain of the wound again. And so one engages in this cycle where you push things away but it returns in subconscious ways. And then that makes you more agitated. 

00:57:05
ROBERT T. CARTER  And irritable. And that irritability may be expressed in attributions about the person in your life and how they're treating you or not treating you. You may not, or the person may not even be aware that what's occurring to them is a manifestation of race based traumatic stress injury. I, so the person as I was just saying is not aware of the source of their feelings. 

00:57:35
ROBERT T. CARTER  As mental health professionals, it's in, it would be important to explore the person's history and experience to uncover the last straw or to uncover the wound that hasn't healed to determine whether or not there have been prior traumatic experiences, ah, whether a person has had other ah, series of events that have created stress for them or trauma. 

00:58:10
[sil.] 

00:58:10
ROBERT T. CARTER  As a mental health professional, you also need to pay attention to whether or not you think this is something that actually exist or whether you are traditionalist and subscribe to that traditional ways of understanding people's experiences. 

00:58:30
[sil.] 

00:58:30
ROBERT T. CARTER  I also encourage you to try to help people understand that they can be injured psychologically and emotional, and emotionally by race based experiences and that those experiences can, can, that can produce trauma and to sort of look for that last straw or experience that might have moved their stress of racism into the, ah, turn to the traumatic area. So here are some of our examples that I'd like to ah, use as uhm, exploration material and discussion material. So we have a professor who graduated from a top rank university who in a class was confronted by ah, a white male student, you know these things never happen, right? Who says, "What gives you the right to teach this class?" The man who recruited her to teach told her that she would not have been hired had she been white. He says, "I'm not sure you have the power, intellectual ability or drive we are looking for." 

00:59:50
[sil.] 

00:59:50
ROBERT T. CARTER  As her life goes on, she continues to be exposed to slights and as a result of the way to cope, she throws herself into her work. But she experiences this sense of constant or heightened scrutiny. She becomes depressed, has migraine headaches and is given anti-seizure meds. 

01:00:15
[sil.] 

01:00:15
ROBERT T. CARTER  She goes to a conference, gives a talk and a white man explains that she should not take offense to being called a jungle bunny because he says, "You're cute and so are bunnies." This other white male scholar says to her how she reminds him of the family's maid. 

01:00:45
[sil.] 

01:00:45
ROBERT T. CARTER  So, now she finds herself having difficulty be, working effectively at her office at the university. She's having difficulty concentrating and she has this constant sense of dread. So, what I've shared with you so far, what would you say are the race base trau(ph), race based traumatic stress elements in this case? This is a real question, not a rhetorical question. 

01:01:15
[sil.] 

01:01:15
ROBERT T. CARTER  Please interact with me. 

01:01:25
[sil.] 

01:01:25
ROBERT T. CARTER  Somebody? Yes. 

01:01:30
 Use, using the derogatory terms, uhm, these are typically uhm, attributed towards the person's race, so jungle bunny is a notion of jungle associated with Africa, uhm, then, what was the other one, the family's maid. I think we, uhm, talked about mommyism(ph) and what are the other, ah, sections. And so, uhm, I guess contextualizing it from Africa and service, you have, uhm, a rich understanding of what the traumatic stress elements might be in terms of the dialogue and the specific... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
ROBERT T. CARTER Okay. But rem, (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
 Derogatory events. 

01:02:10
ROBERT T. CARTER But remember, this, this applies to individuals. So, what wa, what must we assume to be true about her if we think those things impacted her in that manner? 

01:02:20
[sil.] 

01:02:20
ROBERT T. CARTER  Gentlemen in the back in his, with a sweater? 

01:02:30
[sil.] 

01:02:30
  Ah, I think based on some of the other things we talked about here, it's clear that this is more of which you talked about as a, not, not even a last straw because if she hasn't maybe completely broken down in this scenario but these statements alone, ah, first of all, as the brother was saying, these statements have a historical context but also the statements have historical context combined with the previous traumas that she may have had based on the perceptions of her being a woman in, in this environment, being a Black woman in this environment, uhm, and contextually, ah, I think add to it to create what you talked about as an added stress to a situation which stressors had already been, ah, present in, in that situation. 

01:03:15
ROBERT T. CARTER Okay. Good. Other thoughts? 

01:03:15
  Uhm, just to piggyback on what was just said. Uhm, in addition to the valence of having, ah, being sus, susceptible to depression or some other type of, ah, negative feelings. I think beyond going racial blows is, is much like a, a physical wound that is, is, is never healing and every time you try to heal it, you know, there's this, the, the, the cut is made again and it's, there's a new, there's a new blow that causes this wound to continue to, continue and never really heal and, and it just, ah, it wear you down and that's, that's what I'm sensing in here. 

01:04:00
ROBERT T. CARTER  Okay. Yes. (clears throat) 

01:04:05
[sil.] 

01:04:05
  I was also think even in terms of the three types that you talked about and it seems like it would fall under the discriminatory harassment where she has been accepted, "accepted into a space" as a professor actually of having been hired and then she's in a space where there's, she's caught. There's, you're, you're in the situation and then you're being treated a certain way. So, I would just think of it in terms of classifying it among the three, and that's what came to mind, (crosstalk) 

01:04:40
ROBERT T. CARTER Yeah. 

01:04:40
 Maybe. 

01:04:40
ROBERT T. CARTER And, and she was beginning to, at first, she had her first episode, I think, of, trauma when she that manifested herself in the migraines and the depression. The most of us who would have seen her would have not associated those symptoms with being traumatized but I think that those were the first, where one can argue, were the first signs of her having ah, been suffering from race based traumatic stress. (clears throat) Uhm, then it, then it deepened when after the other events and then she began to feel deeply uncomfortable in the work setting, and so that her, the per, since of, of constant and pervasive vulnerability began to take over. Uhm, and I think those, that was the core element, for me, of the presence of race based traumatic stress injury for her. So, thank you. So, here's another one, another case to discuss. A light skinned Hispanic male was treated courteously when he made application for an apartment in New York City. Here when he returned with his African-American wife, the renting agent became aloof and informed them that the apartment was rented. In response to the denial of the apartment, the wife immediately became depressed, insomniac and hyper vigilant. She had repeated nightmares and at the time of the alleged discrimination she noticed that her hair began to fall out, that her skin was dry and that she was constipated. What's your assessment? 

01:06:25
[sil.] 

01:06:25
ROBERT T. CARTER  And you're being good clinicians, you're taking it in, okay, good, ah. What's your assessment? Gentleman here. 

01:06:45
  Well, as a clinician, what I would want to do is also get more information from her regarding the context in which this happens. I mean, I doubt that this is a singular event in her life and I would want to ask her what other events may have happened in her life that feel like they were similar whet, whether memories of those came up for her after this happened, if this has been a source of any sort of either, uhm, closer bonding with her husband or distancing with her husband. Uhm, and the meaning, you know, the meaning she attributes to this discriminatory treatments and how, how she might cope with that, I might help her cope with such system like discrimination. 

01:07:30
ROBERT T. CARTER  So, you wanna do some history. 

01:07:35
 Yes. 

01:07:35
ROBERT T. CARTER How do you think, what do you, what is your attribution about this experience? 

01:07:40
 To be honest, I'm not sure I understand your question? Could you rephrase it? 

01:07:45
ROBERT T. CARTER How do you understand her symptoms from this experience? 

01:07:50
 I think that she's had a discriminatory experience some of that can be, you know, processed physically as well as emotionally. 

01:08:00
ROBERT T. CARTER Okay. 

01:08:00
 But you know. 

01:08:00
ROBERT T. CARTER  Other thoughts? 

01:08:10
[sil.] 

01:08:10
ROBERT T. CARTER  There's a young lady all the way in the back row? 

01:08:20
 I have such a strong adverse reaction. I'd wanna find out other times that she's experienced any, or perceived any type of discrimination, and also what her reaction were during those times and see if it, this could be re, like post-traumatic reaction. It could have just brought up memory from years ago that's causing even... (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
ROBERT T. CARTER Okay. 

01:08:40
 ...more rejection. 

01:08:40
ROBERT T. CARTER Okay, thanks. See, I, I think this is an example of a last straw event, that this, maybe she had experiences before, probably did in some way, shape or form but what, what, whatever had happened before, this was a last straw and this event moved her into, uhm, the events being stressful to now being traumatic. So, this symptom manifestation for me is clearly evidence of trauma, that this event produced trauma for her. The depression not being able to sleep, the nightmares, the physical manifestations, the physiological reactions, sort of all as a constellation of what I would cons, consider to be traumatic reactions, and so that, this experience of discrimination rose to the level of being traumatic for her. So, this, to me, is an illustration of a race based traumatic stress injury. In the literature where this case was excerpt, excerpted from, this was, ah, diagnosed as PTSD. And so, I rai(ph), I shared this case with you because I think that when you make this a PTSD diagnosis, you're saying that she has, she is now disordered from this experience. And I contend that she now has been injured by this experience, and I think that's a very different kind of thing to say, and that the non-pathological assessment of race based traumatic stress injury communicates something very different than to say that she is, has a post-traumatic stress disorder. I don't think she's disordered. I think she was deeply, deeply injured by that event. Okay? 

01:10:40
ROBERT T. CARTER And our last example is the office party. One employees found out that their Black female co-worker, Sheryl(ph) had a, had a birthday and learned that she was expecting. The white co-workers gave her a party with a cake that was decorated with the image of a pregnant dark-skinned woman with an inscription that said, "Happy birthday, Sheryl(ph)! It must have been the watermelon seeds." 

01:11:10
[sil.] 

01:11:10
ROBERT T. CARTER  Sheryl said, "When I saw the inscription, I just stared at it" and said, "Oh, thank you." I, I could not get angry. I was pregnant and this is my job. Your assessment? 

01:11:35
[sil.] 

01:11:35
ROBERT T. CARTER  What do you think this case illustrates? Young lady here? 

01:11:45
  Yes, uhm, quid pro quo example that you talked about. Your, uhm, your collusion for your job. 

01:12:00
ROBERT T. CARTER Quid pro quo racial harassment. 

01:12:00
 Exactly. 

01:12:00
ROBERT T. CARTER  Anything else? 

01:12:05
[sil.] 

01:12:05
  I think, uhm, she was at a heightened sense of, uhm, the context of the office and recognized that, uhm, responding to it may have not only negative physiological reactions for her but then prenatally do some damage to the baby... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
ROBERT T. CARTER Uh hmm. 

01:12:30
 Which would result in stuff like lowered birth weight or any of those kinda concerns and so seizing the house and, uhm, I guess, ah, stronger coping skills. (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
ROBERT T. CARTER  Yeah. 

01:12:45
 And not responding in that moment. 

01:12:45
ROBERT T. CARTER Yeah. Yeah. Uhm, this is, ah, I think an excellent example of quid pro quo racial harassment that in many ways, many of us have been subjected to in one way, shape or form at sometime in our lives. Uhm, and it's unclear, ah, and this, this for me, is, it's unclear what, whether this would have been a last straw event for her, uhm or not, uhm, 'coz we don't have enough information in the case to be able to assess that. Uhm, so with that, I think I'm getting ready to summarize, uhm, evidence shows at race based, racial trauma produces stress, symptoms like DSM disorders but DSM disorders don't match the etiology of symptom manifestations of person's experience in race based traumatic stress injury. The threat required for racial trauma may be experienced in the present or vicariously. Uhm, the fear and trauma associated to racial trauma may not be discussed due to the chronic and pervasive nature of racism. And then I think, so this highlights the, the fact that people who experience these things are less likely to talk about them, uhm, as being the, the center of what they're experiencing. They're more likely to present with other kinds of issues than these kinds of issues. So to find this, to assess it and to recognize it, I think you really need to look very, very carefully in their history, in their experiences, in their coping, in their racial identity development to determine whether they have experienced race based traumatic stress injury. 

01:14:30
[sil.] 

01:14:30
ROBERT T. CARTER  So, I think there's, there's a need for clarification of inconsistency in the definitions of racism such as racial discrimination, discriminatory harassment and racial harassment, in a legal and psychological literature, clear policies and procedures for filing complaints of racial harassment in, in the law as well as within organizations and institutions, recognition of the effects of race based traumatic stress in mental health assessment guidelines, a larger body of research evidence that documents the injuries of racism and treatment strategies that specifically designed to assist people in coping with effects of race based traumatic stress. Thank you.
