ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Okay, good morning. Brave souls, up on eight. Good for you. Uhm, I'm Annellen Simpkins and I'm moderating for Multicultural Issues and we have Derald Wing Sue, Robert Dilts, and Bessel van der Kolk. What a great panel so join me in welcoming them.

00:00:25
DERALD WING SUE Ah, okay, all right. Ah, thank you everyone for showing at 8 a.m. in the morning. Uhm, I was just sharing with Robert that I'm due to fly out, ah, today but in essence my wife in New York tells me there's a big snow storm that has hit there and I might be, ah, unpleasantly or pleasantly, ah, here. Uhm, so, you know, that's one's of the things but let me, first of all, talk about this issue of multicultural. It's something how I became interested in that and its application. I think to mental disorders and the types of counseling and therapy that is offered, uhm, one of the things that I noted when I was very young was that much of the concepts of mental health, much of the concept of what, ah, constituted a helping relationship did not resonate with my experiential reality. Uhm, I, you know, for example, one of the, uhm, you know, primary, ah, aspects of mental health, ah, ah, growth was, uhm, that of individualism than an individual is healthier when they began to become autonomous independent, ah, can stand on their own feet and move on their own in a forward, ah, manner. Mat-- much of counseling in psychotherapy, ah, traditionally come from a western European perspective that is very individualistic in this orientation and fails to note I think that three corners of the world has a very collectivistic orientation that is, ah, ah, the road to mental health or the psychosocial unit of operation is not the individual but the family, the group, or the collective society and often times, the, ah, ah, assumption that we have to individuate from our families, from our group and become autonomous is perceived by many cultures as unhealthy and undesirable, ah, that's one thing that I noted in terms of, of, of counseling. The other thing that I'll quickly share with, uhm, ah, some of you that began to make me, ah, explore deeply the culture bound, class bound, and linguistic biopsy of traditional mental health practice occurred when my brother, Stan, did a major study, a several study in the entire state of Washington about the utilization patterns of people, of color, ah, Asian, Americans, Afri-- uhm, African-Americans, Latino Americans and, uhm, ah, Native Americans as well as White Americans and we found two trends that began to make both of us question the adequacy of the current mental health practice and system. One of them was that people of color, ah, tended to under utilize traditional mental health, uhm, ah, facilities, ah, it-- and when in comparison to their, ah, White counterpart to would come in. The second thing that occurred was that they prematurely terminated. Now, I know that's an evaluative ah, statement but they prematurely terminated after the only one initial contact with the mental health professional. Now this is, you know, over 50% of them give this regardless of their racial cultural, ah, ah, back ground. This is in more contrast to less than a 30% termination rate among White clients who are white, ah, ah, individuals who utilize that services. We began to ask the question, uhm, which really is important to ask what is causing the under utilization and why is it that people of color terminate, ah, at such a high rate after an initial contact. Ah, you know, one of the things I like to entertain is that may be people of contact, ah, people of color are mentally healthier than their White counterparts therefore, they don't need, they're cured, uhm, ah, easily. I really don't believe that because all of the international and national studies indicate that mental health disorders are, ah, pretty constant across all groups. Although, they're manifestation is quite different depending on the cultural, ah, context and, and dynamic that is going on. One of the thing that we begin to look at, ah, was that, you know, okay, I'm not gonna talk so much about the institutional why they're under utilize, ah, because there is an institutional bias issue that leads to another area that is very social political in nature but what we found, ah, on the interpersonal, the contact between the therapist or helping professional and the, ah, culturally diverse clients that they, ah, worked with, we found that, uhm, that, that it was due to the inappropriateness of the transactions that occurred between the helping professional and the culturally diverse client that they work with and when I say inappropriateness, uhm, and what we found was that almost all forms of counseling and psychotherapy are, ah, ah, are culture and class bound. That is that you have certain values inherent of that and within that. Request that client self disclosed, inside, ah, ah, individualism, ah, on economy. These were cultural values that seen at odds with many of the cultural values that clients, ah, came in from. Now the other thing that we didn't ask in our, ah, ah, in the-- at this point, uhm, is the current research that I-- I've been involve with and that current research deals with, ah, racial, gender, sexual orientation, microaggressions that are unwillingly delivered by well intention, ah, counselors or therapist towards their, ah, ah, clients of color unknowingly, this microaggressions really reflect the culture bound, class bound, and linguistic, ah, biopsies that are held with almost all socially marginalized or socially, ah, ah, devalued group. Microaggressions are the everyday insult and dignities and validations that are unwillingly, unintentionally, delivered by a well intention helping professional who are, is unaware that that indeed is going on and the area of multiculturalism, I'd like to say as the word as the last word goes beyond that of race and, ah, a culture and ethnicity. Almost any marginalized group in our nation can experience microaggressions whether it be women, whether the LGBTQ, ah, individuals, or even people with disabilities and these microaggressions really are, ah, in a very, ah, powerful, uhm, I would like to give one example of a disability microaggression that is very important. Ah, my colleague, uhm, Dr. Richard Keller of the-- ah, director of disabilities services at Teachers College at Columbia University is, ah, blind and he says that when he-- when people are introduce to him, ah, they will come up to him and say, "Good morning, Robert. How are you?" And, ah, Robert should responses always, ah, "I can hear perfectly well, Thank you." Ah, but the disability microaggression being delivered is that, ah, a person with a disability is disabled in all aspects of their functioning or they're talk to in a very tiled like, ah, ah, fashion. And you have gender microaggressions, racial microaggressions, and like I was saying, this is so invisible to the helping professional that they don't realize what a negative impact it has on clients and clients will not confront the therapist generally about it. They will simply not return. Ah, in our studies indicate that many, ah, ah, clients have color said that one, they did not return because after the session they felt worst. They felt less liberated, less healthy as a result of the, ah, ah, counseling, ah, therapy that they, ah, ah, received and the second thing was that the therapist lack the understanding of what it means to be Black, what it means to be Asian, what it means to be, ah, gay? Ah, and there nothing they don't want to understand but the disparity in world views are great. I turn it over you Robert. 

00:09:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, thank you. 

00:09:50
DERALD WING SUE Thank you. 

00:09:50
ROBERT DILTS Well, uhm, if my, my contribution here is, ah, Bessel was saying is, "Well, you don't, you don't look very multicultural," and which is, which is true and I'm-- I come from, come from California, ah, but, uhm, I, I actually live part-time, I live part-time here, part-time in Europe and France. And my-- ah, I literally travel and work all over the world and, and so I've been in-- usually my year takes me to, you know at least, ah, 20 or 30 different cultures and so, uhm, and, and, you know, and that, that experience has, you know, really been quite, ah, a wonderful awakening, uhm, and as, as they're all saying, you know, I think that the key to being able to deal with multicultural issues is, uhm, a developing, ah, greater and greater awareness of where differences are. You know, it's oftentimes when you first go and you, you visit, you know, you can go and visit some place and you have a sort of superficial fascination with the differences but then, uhm, as you begin to spend time or you became more intimate, you begin to realize that they are so many things that we take for granted. Like that we are unaware of that coming from our own cultural and cultural programming, uhm, that we, ah, even, even being well intentioned are acting in biased way or, you know, insulting somebody or making a mistake. Uhm, so my area is, is neurolinguistic programming and we would say that cultural and culturalism is one of the key areas in which we are get our neurolinguistic program and the, the, the essential sort of, you know, ah, teaching of NLP is that whatever our programming, we are not aware of essentially runs us. Right, it's the water that we swim in, we have no choice about it and we are kind of run by it. And next, you know, I think one of the great gifts of, of multicultural, uhm, interaction is this, ah, greater bringing into awareness of where there are differences and how we can then expand our own ability to cross bridges to, uhm, work between different maps and models of the world. I think the, the thing I would is, is, uhm, because I'm constantly needing to adapt from one culture to another, ah, I would say, I'm usually aware of, of different levels of where the differences might occur and so I, I would just go over a couple of this levels. Usually the most fundamental level is, is relationship to the environment so relationship to time. You know, you go to, you go to Italy or something and their relationship to time is quite different than in Switzerland or in Germany and so you know, that's, ah, you know kind of some of obvious differences. Ah, you know, you know, if I'm-- you make an appointment that supposed to start at nine o'clock in, ah, Italy, you know, probably gonna be 9:15. In the farther south you go, it might be 9:30. Uhm, but if you're in Switzerland, you know, if its nine it's nine. You know, it's something like that. But then obviously, so that's, there's environ-- ah, relationship to the environment, to time, to space. Ah, you know, ah, there's the whole notion of, you know, ah, ah, you know, comfort with physical distance. How closely you get to somebody, ah, with, with, ah, that kind of thing? Then their behavioral differences so, you know, we, we act different, there are different languages, there are different patterns of behavior and, and kind of taboos of, you know, relating to touch or other things. But then you begin, I think to get to some of the more, you know, ah, challenging ones because then you're gonna find as, as, ah, Derald is saying and he begin to find that there are differences in, in the way that people think about thing. So it's not just in the way you relate to the environment which is very obvious. It's concrete or, you know, ah, ah, behavior but how do you think about, how do you approach to solve the problem, you know, uhm, what are the, what are the leadership strategy got to (inaudible ) through with mindset, ah, this kind of thing is very important from the NLP perspective for instance. We would say that, uhm, you know, there are, ah, the different senses or representational system often have different significance and different cultures. Some cultures are more visual, some are more auditory. Ah, I was actually, before coming here I was doing a conference in, uhm, in New Mexico and we-- ah, a lot of the people there work with the, you know, first, first nation people, the Native American people. Well, one of the very obvious things that happens there is that in, in, ah, in interaction, it is actually insulting to look at somebody in the eyes and so, the, the people are often looking a way when you're speaking and you only look at somebody. In fact, if, if there's a kind of an aggressive thing. If somebody says something that, that makes you, you know, upset and, and so you find very often that, that people interpret as looking a way. In fact, as, well, you're not, you're being deceitful or you're not being, you know, you're, you're avoiding connection. So, so, there's this whole relationship I would say to, to not only then, the environment and behavior but to the senses to the way that we think some cultures are much more in the body. When I go to bra-- I always love Brazil because it's such an embody culture. Uhm, ah, but then I, ah, they're always talking about, ah, ah, what I think, the really challenging parts begin. That, you know, the others-- they're, they're interesting and if you have some basic awareness, you, you would just and you would pay attention and you begin to recognize these things. But then you, you get into the area where there are differences of beliefs and values. You know, the, the valuing of, you know, what, what is important and what you believe about thing and this is where it's I think it beco-- it's much more invisible and also much more significant. Uhm, so again like, like they're all saying, uhm, the, the value of so-- you know, ah, the social versus individual, ah, connection or growth. Uhm, I was, I was just last just last month in, in Benin in, ah, West Africa. You know, I was -- the way I was describing-- let's say to some places I go where it's like I'm go-- I know I'm going to a different cultures. There's other places where you actually go into a different reality. Uhm, in-- at Benin is the poorest country in, ah, in Africa and, uhm, ah, religious, religious breakdown is 15% Islam, 15% Christian, the other 70 is Voodoo, and so, you know, I would be talking with somebody and, ah, I remember one conversation. Somebody was saying, "Oh, yes. They, they just caught an 8-year-old sorcerer the other night," and, and, you know, they don't take to the-- so there's a people that, we would say, when I found out about, ah, the, ah, background of this 8-year-old child, you know, he clearly had a traumatic, you know, a traumatic childhood as, you know, it was, ah, a lot of violence in his family, his, his, ah, father had abandon the family, the mother was struggling but they interpret his symptoms as he had been, uhm, and, and it's very interesting these were not, ah, uneducated people, this-- the person I was talking to is man who works in the-- is, ah, works as an economist in the finance ministry. But I say, you know, yeah, he's got possessed by this spirit that came from the baobab tree that was in the-- in this part of the-- this town and, and then they, uhm, what they do is, you know, they take people and they, they don't do talking therapy. They might you know, ah, kill an animal and pour blood on them or something like this and this is, you know, we think of that as, as strange and unusual and yet, in this culture that is-- that's the normal thing in their market places. You have, uhm, places for, for voodoo, you know, for fetishes and things like this. Uhm, I went to a place there and, ah, they were having, ah, celebration and people would routinely become suddenly possessed and take on a certain character, and it was not considered strange that's, that's what happens, you know, that's normal and people weren't pretending, you know, that's what occurs there. So the farther you get from, from westernized and we, we begin to realize we have a very western belief system. My son is working there in the Peace Corps for example and trying to help, ah, you know, you, you go to the some of the, the more isolated villages and you see the, the, ah, many of the babies have a bloated belly not from famine but from malnutrition. Ah, I mean protein deficiency but they-- the, the parents don't think it's a problem. In fact, they think my child is well fed. You know, look at the belly. And so you, you think but, you know, and you try to explain nutrition and they say, "What's nutrition?" Right? If you, you say vitamin C is good for the immune for the immune system, what's vitamin C? What's the immune system? Even, even the, the person who is the chief executive of, ah, rice cooperative that my son was working for, got malaria and said oh, yeah, you know, I, I got, I got too much sun. And you think well, malaria doesn't come from the sun, it comes from mosquito and so, it's like you begin to realize, "Well, wait not everybody has the same beliefs." And you, you, begin to realize there's a very-- when, when so many believes they're different, it really is like you, you're living in a different reality and I think that bring just, just-- I would say a couple of more levels. One, the sort of level beyond then, ah, belief is, is identity and you're, you know, they're talking about, you know, when, ah, well, you can, you can identify with many things, race is clearly an identity, a religion, and or gender but these identity issues are, ah, they're, ah, in even deeper, I would say they are in even deeper level than our beliefs or values. In fact, they sort of consolidate, you know, beliefs and values into a sort of whole identity and, and that becomes very, ah, significant. I think especially as we're doing therapy or where looks seeking to, to help people is, you know, understanding how that identity relates to another identity. You know, uhm, you know, obviously in west Africa, I s-- I standout like a sort of thumb, you know, as a White person and, ah, you know, the children either running hide and cry or they're very curious and follow you around. You know, they follow you all over the place. So, and, and what I also notice, ah, is you know, reactions to particular things. Ah, when I'm in some, some cultures, again if you begin to do something that is, is hypnotic, you might suddenly get very strong abreactions not because of what you do but because of people's expectations about what is supposed to happen if something like that goes on. Uhm, the, the final one from me is about sort of the, the, the what I would call sort of, ah, a spiritual level which is people's not, not so much the relationship to their own identity or ethnic group but a relationship to their, you know, their larger world. You know, the relationship to the universe, to God, ah, and I think those obviously become, ah, other very important parts of cultural differences, cultural programming. Uhm, they all, they all really, you know, they create this kind of, ah, very complex pattern world, world view and again, you know, I think as my point would just be that, uhm, for me it's, it's not so much a problem. It's, it's never a problem when you are aware of it, when I'm aware, okay, there's this people have this view. They're gonna interpret and hear what I say this way then I can, you know, adjust that. I can be aware. It's when I don't have the awareness that I'm you know as, as they're always saying, you know, doing this microaggressions. You know, ins-- i-- i-- insulting or, or, you know, uhm, doing something that is em-- embarrassing or harmful to somebody out of, out of ignorance not out of willful intention or out of a sense of superiority or arrogance but more out of this kind of, ah, ignorance. So I think our ability to be aware of all of these different levels of programming is very important. 

00:22:55
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, you know, when you go to... 

00:23:00
ROBERT DILTS I think your... 

00:23:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah, do you hear me? Ah, when you go to Africa you-- or Asia... 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN Louder. 

00:23:05
ROBERT DILTS Bryan, I think you need... 

00:23:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Do you turn it on? 

00:23:10
DERALD WING SUE No, you can't do it from there. 

00:23:15
ROBERT DILTS He has to turn it on for me. 

00:23:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK No, he's coming up to do something. 

00:23:20
DERALD WING SUE He, he supposedly gave you the better microphone. 

00:23:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK That's better. 

00:23:30
ROBERT DILTS Ah. 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, uhm, you know, when you go to out to Mongolia as in, as in America or to, ah, Africa, Benin, you see the difference obviously but I'm impress with as the differences within all of us and how we all have very different cultural assumptions. 

00:23:45
ROBERT DILTS Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK I don't know anybody in the whole world who has the same assumptions as I do so my closest than others but as is it question of gradation, uhm, and sometimes our culture assumptions are very different from what we assume also. 

00:24:00
ROBERT DILTS Uh-huh. 

00:24:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And let's say I have an interview that I'll talk about this afternoon, in my book show and then talk with the person who looks like me who could be my mother or something I totally assumed that she has the same culture back on, back on as I do. At some point, I start talking with her about sort of basic Darwinian evolutionary ideology that I have, ah, and she starts to cringe because she is fundamentalist Christian and he-- she thinks I am an emissary of Satan for talking that particular way but she looks exactly the way I do. She dresses like I do. She drives her car as I do but her fundamental assumptions are so different and that's what's happens-- that's the tough part. 

00:24:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:24:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK It's also hard when you go Benin because you don't expect people to have the same substance as you do. 

00:24:45
ROBERT DILTS That's true. 

00:24:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, like-- let me gives an example, uhm, very flagrant one. I grew up-- I was born at the very end of the second World War as in Holland and I walk through the ruins of my hometown and my entire national identity of Dutch people is bad look what does Nazis did to us and we were noble people who, uhm, resisted Nazis old war troop but, but, you know, just what, what are told. 

00:25:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, 

00:25:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, and we immerse with second World War heroically from rebuilding our cities. At one point I'm in a conference and there's a German guy who, who's raised just across the border like 150 miles from me. It looks like it may address in front of me, speak lightly different language and I say, uhm, how did the second world war impact in you? He said, "Not at all. Unimportant, no impact to me whatsoever." Uhm, so do you-- did you know anybody was killed in your family? Yeah, so I were, ah, there's anybody British-Europe drop in the middle of rubble so yeah, I did. Did it have an impact in you? Absolutely, not. And here, we live 100 miles away from each other, my entire identities forms by does war. His entirely, entirely identity is formed by the desire as it were, huh. Uhm, and the issue of denial is huge - 

00:26:15
ROBERT DILTS Uh-hmm. 

00:26:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK - and he don't know denial because we don't know, both we don't know and so we are so ignorant about ourselves in so many ways but what we-- what all-- our all assumptions are, ah, what we value and if you asked me how do you think about authority I'll give you one story but I-- we won't know it until we ask out authority, you got the whole different story and so, so what people know about themselves is so limited. Uhm, another great example, uhm, I have a friend who grew up in Australia and his father maintained the railroad between Adelaide and Perth which is the largest stretch of uninhabited countries in the world. And so he has not encounter to anybody. He was not, ah,-- the teacher would drop, ah, would drop school books down from time to time and he was living in the middle of a total cultural desert. At age 18, he gets drafted to go Vietnam and he's not like the kids, kids from Sydney or Melbourne. He doesn't know anything about urban life or anything. He goes to Vietnam. He comes back, start working with (inaudible ) administration and then, he is, uhm, the Kobe earthquake happens in Japan and he has the impulse to go go to Japan and help the people there. And he goes there and he gets some consultations with people, how do I deal with the Japanese people. And this expert tell him, "Well, you know, it's really important to understand the Japanese. They're very formal people so you need to just really keep the distance and talk to them very formally and you should never talk about feelings and you should never hug them or touched them." He said, "Okay, thank you very much." And he goes and listen, listen to the refugee camp in Kobe and, uhm, you know, he does know anything. He's an, he's an ignorant person but can be so helpful, you know, and so he sits there and every morning, he said, "Let's sit down together and talk about we feel about our homes being destroyed and people being killed." And at the end of the hour long session, he always said, "Let's go hug each other." And they hugged each other and they do stuff. And so after about two weeks, he leaves and he asked (inaudible ) "Let's write down with the most helpful." And so these Japanese people say, what's most helpful that they had the chance to talk about my feelings and the hugging at the end of the meeting were so great. So we don't know, ah, and that makes us so, so complicated and it's very hard to see things. Uhm, not the Japanese example, I was in Fukushima and Sendai-- Sendai last year or two year ago after the earthquake and I-- we had, recently, Hurricane Katrina. We also had 9/11 in US and you saw the different cultural adaptations to these things. Uhm, New York, New York is individualistic which people are culturally sensitive tend to degrade, ah, but New York had a sensational response to the whole thing. Ah, I like you to celebrate the first seconds talking, talking in terms of the culture cuz we tend say if they are, a culture isn't great and other culture are more sensitive, etcetera, etcetera. What happen in New York after 9/11 are sensational. Uhm the bombs drop, no-- nobody knew it, it was done and on September 12, the New York Times comes out and it has a whole section of writers and artist writing about how you respond to something that you don't know where it came from? 

00:29:45
ROBERT DILTS Uh-hmm. 

00:29:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK A mysterious illness and some give us, it happened and so here, the city, ah, the-- had the culture of New York is to help people to fight a language for ennoble experience. Just profound how the whole culture work together and to my mind, the response in New York after 9/11 was the pinnacle of what's culture can do to bring people together. And that's, and that's really prove yourself because I mean, I mean trauma expert say I do PTSD. It was almost now PTSD after, ah, 9/11 in New York because it does handle so sensitively in terms of really helping people to, ah, begin control of their lives, acknowledging the-- heard what people have felt, helping a friend words, etcetera. This is fantastic. Culture was hurricane Katrina, uhm, a very important issue for America's look. Ah, it's, ah, it's the same country, totally different response has something to do with racial issues, huh? Ah, and so there was no help in Hurricane Katrina. There was no communal response. People are locked up and people are being prevent us from doing anything to change all lives and, and FEMA comes in and Halliburton and they take people's control away from them and, ah, ship people out to camps in Utah and in Houston and the PTSD evade in New Orleans after 9/11 is 35%, 35% of the population without PTSD. Shoot as the cultural issue of how much people were unable to do stuff and people don't think about it. So we go to Sendai and Fukushima and the place is totally, uhm, devastated but I'm there, I think it's May-- June 1st, the issue is held-- is happen on March 11 and it looked like it happened yesterday. So it's somehow, the issue of needing to do something and taking care of things was sort of lifted to the bureaucrats and that would never happened in US because people are empower to do things themselves. And then finally as I was back here last year again, when I saw the people had done is they had build refugee camps and very interesting context, uhm, so it was shortly after it happened and people had been housed in gyms and what you saw people do is the natural thing that I thought is very quite universal. People set up little cubicles where their families live, little tents inside this-- a whole like this one and, uhm, they would have little openings and they would open this to their neighbor so you would see this little neighborhoods evolved where people would have easy access to talk to people, to play with people, to cook with people and you saw this natural evolution of a community, ah, with prepared people and non-prepared people. Then the Japanese government, they comes in there who has no understanding of its own country interestingly enough and they builds this housing projects. We have this long grows of houses stretch a little bit like the corridors here in the conventional, uhm, and there's no access between the houses from one row to another so all the communal things were people have have open access to each other, instead in circles where you can easily access your neighbors and your friends, ah, like a real community was being prevented because it already straight lines where people cannot talk to each other. And so, uhm, seeing how people need to live and understand thing is terribly important. Another thing that's, uhm, I realize in, in Japan, uhm, it's not an interesting issue something you may want to argue with it but, uhm, there's an interesting, uhm, attitude about victims and how people see victims is very different from one culture to another. There's always an issue of same of shame. Every culture has an issues of shame but it is, ah, let's say, it seems to discover that. Uhm, at one point, I'm-- I went to canoeing in Victoria's Strait, it's north of Australia and my guide was a Australian guy who is working, ah, is also a guy in Northern Thailand, ah, canoeing and he tells me after spend the together, "You know, what I really do in Northern Thailand is smuggle Thai girls and Burmese girls out of Thailand who are-- is later for prostitution and that's really what I do over there." And he says, "You know what people in Thailand say, the only people cared about this girls are Christian people. That there is nothing in our culture that has pity for poor and oppressed people because our culture is really very much about survival of the fetish." And I thought that's interesting. I don't know if it's totally true but I'd never thought about it that there might be something particularly good about, ah, attitude of compassion that may actually be more of a western value than the value of other persons of the worth. Ah, I just thought it out there. It's an interesting issue, I don't know. Uhm, so its issues like of, of not knowing and of course, what I also want to talk about is the gigantic cultural issue in this country which is just runs our politics and runs our reality and that's the issue of, uhm, what we'd like to call diversity, but in fact, the legacy of slavery in our country. And the legacy of slavery in our country is gigantic as it gets played out in every election. And I would just like to say, I have some figures here, I'd like to share with you guys, uhm, before I do that, let me just read this. A colleague of ours recently at Princeton University did a neuroimaging study, we're talking about compassion again. She shows pictures of poorer and homeless people to people lying in the scanner. The brain of sort of regular or middle class Americans, when they see poor and homeless people is-- has the same activation as if you see a chair or a table or an objects and so the Japanese are also low in not really paying attention to victims that's something, you know, that it's part of our culture, part of our brains, part of our nature as well, ah, but so it's very hard to people to really, uhm, open up their heart for people who are homeless and they aren't rather and of course, many of us in this room work exactly this people like that and we oftentimes work as people who are extremely, uhm, disorganized, ah, irresponsible, ah, deferrable things and the labels of the psychiatric pressures certainly are of harshness, condemning, etcetera, etcetera. And then when you see where people come from, it becomes really, amazing. Uhm, it took me a long time for me to realize that slavery wasn't that long ago, 150 years ago, so only a few generation since that time. Slaves in this country which are about 10%b of our population are descend from slaves, uhm, had no marriage. Marriage wasn't-- not allowed in most slaves. They have kids but husbands and wives are partners bit sold off, kids who get sold off. There was no family structure. There was nothing that really legally allowed place to be together then, so the war is at the end, and all that stuff just opens up and fore mostly, it has to start creating culture out of nothing where everything was prohibited and they had a very hard time with it and that very hard time with both because they had no traditional for themselves but also society kept into fearing with anything. A Black people couldn't get credit. Ah, between, uhm, 1900 and 1970, 90s 2% of all federal housing loans went to White people. Almost no loans for Black people. Almost no , uhm, no credits extend for Black people and somehow they had to make, ah, make a life for themselves. When the secu-- Social Security act was passed, Social Security is very big part of our culture, ah, they excluded two groups of people who would not get social security, domestic servants and agricultural laborer were just the largest part of Black employment. So Black people are excluded from Social Security so this accumulation lasted forever and last especially to this day. Today, we deal with fetish. Uhm, right now in the US, there's 2.3 million people in jail just vastly more in the, in the other country in the world. Just look at the statistics, in Norway, there's 51 per 100,000 people in jail. In the US, 851 per 100,000. This our culture which are cultural differences. Some of us who know about this cultural differences feel really upset about it. Other people feels very proud of that, I don't. Uhm, having people in prison has major consequences for the economy as major part of consequence in families and that means that they're about in our country, uhm, half of this 2.5 million people in jail have kids who never see their parents so there's, there is like 3 million kids in this country who have parents were in jail who did barely ever get to see. Uhm, kids don't go to visit their parents and they'd live without a parent. These kids are, uhm, separate from their parents and well, do you think that's like in terms of an identity, a feeling of justice and feeling of, ah, future for yourself. Ah, and, uhm, the thing is that as therapist, we don't know this things and we can actually not to be expect to know these things because most people don't know these things. And so the question on this, how as a therapist, do you breach that gap between your own notion of the world and where other people come from. Do you have time for three minutes? Ah, we're getting close. Let me just, just, you know, a few minutes. We have till nine, right? 

00:40:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Yeah. 

00:40:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay, good. Uhm, I think it's, it's good to be a little bit like my Australian colleague who doesn't know anything about what the values are. And so I asked people what do you like? Uhm, what's like for you? I don't know about your culture. I don't know what, what your values are so can you tell me, right, and so Judy Herman and I made, ah, uhm, a questionnaire, culture traumatic and succeeding questionnaire you can get it on our web-- website at traumacenter.org, ah, and we ask people, having on the first page you see, so where do you live? Uhm, who makes the bed in the morning? Who does the shopping? Who does the cooking? What sort of cooking do you do? What is in your refrigerator? What is in your walls? Very simple. We ask peoples so when you're, uhm, when you're sick, who cares medicines from the doctor? Or when your car isn't functioning, who, who did-- who helps you with your car? Get sort of the ecology of peoples lives and then we ask people, uhm, when you're in trouble, who do you turn to for help? A lot of White Bosnian people say, "I turn to myself." I doubt for the many Puerto Rican people, people live in the housing projects will say, "I turn towards my therapist." Some people say, "I turn towards my dog." 

00:42:15
ROBERT DILTS Uh-hmm. 

00:42:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And then, you know, you can be really in trouble. So that's where we start and so after we're getting it, yeah, so after getting your picture of what, what people is largely like to say. How about when you're growing up, who saw you as a special person? Who did you feel safe with? Uhm, who is there for you? Let me ask people, what are the rules in your family like? Who made the rules and who enforce the discipline? Were the kids discipline by talking, ah, hitting, slapping, putting an investment etcetera, etcetera and then we ask people, how did your parents solve their disagreements? And those questions gave us enormous amount of information about where people came from in terms of basic assumption of life. Thank you. 

00:43:10
DERALD WING SUE Are, are we going to respond to one another, is that? 

00:43:15
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS You wanna, you wanna do that for a minute? 

00:43:15
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:43:15
ROBERT DILTS Quickly, I think quickly. 

00:43:20
DERALD WING SUE One of the things, I do wanna say initially, ah, here is that there is a major difference between international multiculturalism and domestic multiculturalism. And one of the, ah, issues I think that, uhm, ah, Bessel was touching upon is that there are differences between the international and domestic area. When you deal with domestic multiculturalism, you deal with issues of power and privilege and we see this an operation with respect to, ah, ah, you know, a different groups in, in our society. The other thing I think I would say is that, uhm, I'm--really, I'm quite taken off with, with your, you know, ah, discussions about our turn on states of reality that are variously, you know, shared by, ah, different cultures that we, ah, coming from the western world believe this, ah, a non-western, indigenous methods of healing are inferior to the western concepts of, ah, counseling and psychotherapy and as a result, uhm, ah, there is, there's been a number of individuals who are beginning to deal with what we call the universal shamanic traditions. 

00:44:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:44:35
DERALD WING SUE What are the principles and practices that, uhm, ah, were embedded in these cultures and is that, is that fascinating area to deal with because, ah, most of us in the world of counseling and psychotherapy seemed to think that we wanna adapt the theor-- psychodynamic, existential, humanistic, ah, ge-- gestalt, cognitive behavioral to fit the needs of the culturally, ah, different, ah, ah, individuals that we meet with and I surmise that in, in some sense, it may be better for us to look at the indigenous methods of healing that have existed for centuries and say what are the principles that may be hold from that and I think that, uhm, beholding from that a system of helping and healing would look different than the one that, ah, ah, came from the top-down and the last thing I wanna say quickly is that, uhm, when Robert began by saying when you look at me I don't look multicultural, ah, in-- and I know this is not what you mean but when I look at you as a White person, you have a culture. 

00:45:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:45:50
DERALD WING SUE And the thing I really race culture ethnicity as a function in each and every one of us which is not a Black thing and Asian thing and so forth and the, the difficulty, I think we have, ah, is that many of my well intention White brothers and sisters do not understand themselves as White culture beings. Ah, when I asked, what does it means by White, to be White they flabbergasted. I'm not White, I'm Irish is what they o-- oftentimes say, uhm, you know, and, and you know that if we are-- if the self awareness has to start with each and every one of us understanding ourselves as racial cultural beings and then moving forward from that, ah, respect. 

00:46:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:46:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah, in response to that, uhm, I was teaching somewhere last year and, ah, and the students said, I was in the poll to teach people's CBT and it wouldn't take it in. They were just really just so resistant and I said, "Well, did you ask them that their healing methods where?" And he said, "No, I, ah, no. Why should I?" Uhm, and so, most people in America certainly have no idea that every culture has the it's hidden tradition but there's a downside also and that is the issue of cultural dominance and it was nice that there was, ah, applause for native healing traditions but my experience is when you-- I go to the backlands of China or India and everybody wants to sort of burrow what is-- has been discovered I California. 

00:47:30
ROBERT DILTS Of course. 

00:47:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And California is the center of the universe and unless something, something indirect culture has been codified or accepted in California. It's being-- it's quite worthless and you see that, that, and as I've seen in China, I've seen in India of really very fascinating healing traditions that, that the local community put down. For example, I gave the keynote to the Indian pediatric cong-- congress and then say it to my host, so do you do sort of western type medicine? Do you do Ayurvedic medicine? He says " Ayurvedic medicine that's for primitive people. If we're tourist I like-- I'm like, I'm like New York man. I, I have to mix in culture." So the issue is not just cultural imperialism. It's also that people are looking up and toward to be devalued their own culture anyway. 

00:48:20
ROBERT DILTS I would, I would just-- ah, I'm just quite in a way. I'm relying sort of that for questions it's just, you know, I think, I think one of the, the kind of the thing that is resonating up here is, is just the importance of awareness of culture that is, ah, I think as Derald was saying seeing our, ourselves as culture, as a cultural being and that that is my own personal belief is that healing at, at this basis, healing is healing, trauma is trauma. Around the world, we have the similar nervous system and so and some ways the deep principles of healing, ah, therapy are the same but to get there, right, it's to getting to that place, that's sort of road that is, is, is gonna go through very many cultural sort of windings to do that. So, uhm, that, you know, our, our awareness of our own cultural also are, are awareness of other people's awareness of culture and how they perceived cultural difference. This is, this is also very interesting. Uhm, so I think, I think this, this first very important thing that we're I think we're all saying is that , uhm, when-- whatever we're not aware of is going to come up as a resistance or limitation and so to, to actually begin to become curious about that, that mean the kind of questions that Bessel is going over. Those things make the difference and so to be curious and to be respectful that you know, there, there are differences on many levels and... 

00:49:55
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So questions. 

00:49:55
ROBERT DILTS Question. 

00:49:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN I know there a lot of us so I don't wanna take up all the time but I'm, ah, Indian American female psychologist and, uhm, one of my frustration in graduate school was always, uhm, maybe it's different now but the underpinning of the multicultural curriculum was always kind of how do we deal with minority populations and I hear that a little bit kind of what we're talking about today and, I've always had the fantasy of having, uhm, a team of how do we, as people of color, deal with White clients or microaggressions in the therapy room that sort of thing and that happen a little bit but I wanted to know your thoughts because as I have private practice clinician, I often find when I work with, uhm, clients who are male or White or, you know, different-- visibly different that the, uhm, I, I find it hard to have those conversations when I see as connecting kind of, uhm, experience that are intention of oh, yeah, I love Indian food or I went to this great Indian restaurant yesterday and, and, and it feels, uhm, I can feel the intention of connection there but it's not quite what we're working on. We're working on panic disorder or something that I can kind of, uhm, I guess I struggle with that and I wonder also in terms of educational curriculum if there's anything that, that you guys know of that's being done or to address this or is that possible where is the future for that? 

00:51:35
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:51:35
DERALD WING SUE You know, that's one of the-- a greatest challenges that, uhm, ah, therapist of color have when they deal with someone who is racially, culturally different, ah, them and they make statements or assumptions that push hot buttons in each and every one of us and, uhm, it, it is not therapeutic when you want to strike back and hit them over the head with a hammer, uhm, because they're not there yet. Uhm, what I've learn is that when microaggressions occur, uhm, you have to, uhm, ah, you know, in some way acknowledge the level, for example, did you attend my afternoon yesterday on microaggression, uhm... 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN I did on the morning, I don't remember who's on morning. 

00:52:20
DERALD WING SUE I can't, okay, well, what-- remember that one of the things that I talk about that I oftentimes received is that people come up and complement me for speaking good English. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:52:35
DERALD WING SUE Ah, and you know, and the medic communication that I've always experience as an Asian and, ah, or my Latino brothers and sisters is that you are not a true American. You're a perpetual foreigner in your own country. They aren't aware of that. That's what they're saying. My response, oh, I used to be very angry and defensive. Ah, I now have learned that I simply say thank you, I hope so, I was born here. You know, in which you, you have and this is part of a neurolinguistic sort of - 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:05
DERALD WING SUE - you tap the conscious level and you thank them and you hold on to them but to undermine the medic communication, ah, ah, that is, ah, going on. But the other thing, I think you're talking about is well, you know, situations of what is a role of the therapist in terms of, ah, ah, helping this person through with, with their potential biopsies and assumption and I think one of the important things is that their relationship with you serves us a model to break down whatever potential barrier that, that, that they might have and that you should clinically at some point when the opportunity arises, challenge maybe some of those, uhm, ah, ah, statements, uhm, and to have them explore more deeply but as a person of color, you've gonna have this, ah, you've got to have this secure sense of who you are as a racial cultural being because when you do as a racial cultural being because when you do that, you are less prone to have all of these buttons destruct you from what is going to be helpful to your client. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:54:20
ROBERT DILTS Ah, one thing I would just add, I think, one of the deep issues that we're addressing here is what is, what is our relationship with difference? I mean when people are different in any direction and also what is our relationship with lack of awareness and bias? So what do I-- why do I respond when somebody is unaware, when somebody also does something that's clearly bias and I think, ah, there was a saying something, I think, I think, it's very important which is, I think if we, if we are as therapist are able to assume what, what, what we would call a NLP positive intention but the person is actually not trying to do that, that out of a negative intention. But, you know, then I can actually, instead of responding to the behavior respond to the person, ah, and, and I think that is another, another very key whether its, you know, whichever direction is going. 

00:55:10
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS So we have one minute, do we wanna take one more question? Okay, one more question. Last be shorter. 

00:55:20
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Okay, uhm, I work in-- I'm an Indian and I'm working with an Indian client at, uhm, in a jail setting and, uhm, he's been asking me for very long time, "Help me get out the jail. Help me get out of jail." And I keep giving him the information of why I can't and so one session, he got very, very angry with me and he said, "What kind of Indian are you? You're not helping me. Why don't you wanna help me?' So I'm completely no, I feel like I've lost the therapeutic bond. I don't know where to go next. I'm having the exact opposite problem than the lady before me. So where do I go from here? He's so angry and so hostile towards me now because I won't get him out the jail. 

00:56:00
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:56:05
DERALD WING SUE It's, ah, it's a good question for Bessel. 

00:56:10
[sil.] 

00:56:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK I think he's messing with you that's he, he knows you can get him out of jail so he's, he's, ah, yanking your chain. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN He's only been here for two years. 

00:56:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK What? 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN He's only been here for two years. 

00:56:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK But if he's in jail he knows he can get you-- you've nothing to do with it so I think you need to understand what-- what's underneath them because he knows what to do also, uhm... 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN So just push back a little bit? 

00:56:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK What? 

00:56:40
ROBERT DILTS Push back. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN Just push back a little bit. 

00:56:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Just stay, heck him on. You know just, you know, that I'm a lonely therapist. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN I've used to do that. 

00:56:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Really like use, you know, I'd like I-- you know, I'm as helpless as you are. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Okay, 

00:56:55
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And I'm like can't help-- can't gonna help you in any other way like. 

00:56:55
ROBERT DILTS Actually, actually, what Bessel is saying I think is something very important. What is he's doing is saying is he-- you, you need to join him on this-- we-- in NLP, we talk about pacing and leading. 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:05
ROBERT DILTS So pacing meaning joining him where he is, he's feeling helpless and angry, and frustrated. 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:15
ROBERT DILTS And, and what Bessel saying is you join him there by saying, "Yeah, I know exactly what that's like to be helpless and angry and frustrated." 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:20
ROBERT DILTS Because right now, he's going, "You're superior to me. You can get me out." 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:25
ROBERT DILTS You, you are the, you know, you have all the answers and I think actually, you know, that, that is not your role to have all the answers and, and in that sense met him emotionally, yeah, it's just as frustrating for me. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:57:35
ROBERT DILTS Either it's-- that you aren't feel of just angry and just as helpless. 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

00:57:45
ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Thank you everyone. 

00:57:45
ROBERT DILTS Thank you, guys. 

00:57:50
DERALD WING SUE Yeah.
