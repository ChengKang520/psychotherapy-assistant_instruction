Reality Therapy/Choice Theory Role Play William Glasser, MD 

00:00:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I guess you know my name; it's Dr. Bill Glasser and I'm working with my wife Carleen. And we work together for a long time. And we're gonna do a demonstration role-play. Now Carleen makes it very interesting. She never tells me what she's gonna do. 

00:01:15
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:01:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD So, so I don't, I don't, I have an i-, I don't have any idea what she's gonna do. But she's gonna play a man or a woman? 

00:01:20
CARLEEN A woman. 

00:01:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD A woman. That's, that's, that helps. That helps. 

00:01:25
CARLEEN That's easy. 

00:01:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. And about how old is the woman? 

00:01:30
CARLEEN Uh, about 40ish. 

00:01:30
WOLLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Forty. That's a good age. Okay. So if you wanna get started, I'm ready to get started. 

00:01:40
CARLEEN Okay. 

00:01:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Carleen, uh, you're gonna play a woman about 40? 

00:01:45
CARLEEN Yes. Mm-hmm. I'm coming to see you because, um, my husband thinks I'm crazy and, and so, um, he says I better go get some help. 

00:02:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. Well, what makes him think you're crazy? 

00:02:00
CARLEEN Well, because I'm, I'm worried about something that, um, it's really uncomfortable for me to talk about this but I'm, I'm really a very worrisome. . . 

00:02:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Well make, make do the best you can. 

00:02:15
CARLEEN Okay. Well, you know, of course, that, um, we're very well-known. My husband is quite well-known in, in the media and, and, um, I just, I've been watching all these men. 

00:02:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You won't, you won't mention his name because that's no good. 

00:02:35
CARLEEN (crosstalk) No. 

00:02:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No, okay. Good. 

00:02:35
CARLEEN Well, you know already. 

00:02:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yes, sorry. 

00:02:40
CARLEEN So anyway. . . 

00:02:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) In this room I'm well-known so it's okay. 

00:02:45
CARLEEN Yeah. Well it was, it's not you. 

00:02:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Not me. No. Good. 

00:02:55
CARLEEN Uh, I, he's well-known and, and I've been watching all these men on television who are, you know, cheating on their wives and the media is chasing them down and there's camping out on their front doorsteps and everything and I think, I keep thinking that's gonna happen to us. 

00:03:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. Well . . . 

00:03:20
CARLEEN I mean I just worry night and day. I have nightmares about it. I, I, I wake up thinking that the, the news media is out in front of our yard, in our front yard with a spotlight and everything and, I mean, I've suspected, you know, that my husband is having an affair. 

00:03:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:03:35
CARLEEN But that is bothersome enough. But to worry that he's gonna get caught and this, and be, and we're gonna be exposed to, uh, I can just see us on Jay Leno being ridiculed and, and jokes made about us and stuff. 

00:03:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:03:55
CARLEEN And so I, I don't know how, my husband says I'm crazy, that this is not anything to worry about. 

00:04:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Does your husband admit that he's cheating on you? 

00:04:10
CARLEEN No he, he hasn't but I just, I have. . . 

00:04:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD What makes you think he's cheating on you? I mean, maybe he is, but what makes you think so? 

00:04:15
CARLEEN Well I'm not naive, you know. I, I . . .he's good-looking and he, women like him a lot. I mean they kind of. . . 

00:04:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Cheating with a woman anyway? He's not a homosexual man? 

00:04:30
CARLEEN No. 

00:04:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. That's good. 

00:04:30
CARLEEN No. He, women like him. He, he likes women, too. 

00:04:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:04:35
CARLEEN And I mean, I see him at parties and you know they, they come up to him and, and, and just out in the, in life, and just whenever the press is around, I mean, he, he seems to, like, flirt a little bit. 

00:04:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:04:55
CARLEEN and I don't know. it's just making me shaky. I just, um, when I think about it I start shaking. 

00:05:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:05:05
CARLEEN And he says I'm losing my mind and I, I don't know. . . 

00:05:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, lets, uh, take for example what, what will you do if you find out he is cheating on you? 

00:05:15
CARLEEN Well it's not so bad if I find out but what if everybody else finds out? I don't, I don't want. . . because if everybody else finds out then I'm gonna be the one that's gonna be questioned. I mean, it'll be like, uh, I can't even think about how horrible it would be if, if they come after me and wonder why I'm staying or why don't I leave or why don't I do this. And I'm trying to think of what, what I would do in that situation. It's, it's like what I think about all the time. 

00:05:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:05:55
CARLEEN All the time. It just, it won't go out of my head. I keep thinking and thinking that . . . I keep. . . 

00:06:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD But your husband doesn't admit he's cheating on you? 

00:06:10
CARLEEN No. He won't admit it. And I keep asking him and asking him and asking over and over again. He says . . . 

00:06:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. You have children? 

00:06:15
CARLEEN Yes, we have kids. 

00:06:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD How old are the kids roughly? 

00:06:20
CARLEEN Well, they're not really young. They're, you know. . . 

00:06:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD They're teenagers at least? 

00:06:25
CARLEEN No, seven and nine. 

00:06:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. But they'd be old enough to know if like something like that's happening, at least the nine year old. 

00:06:40
CARLEEN Yeah. I mean, I don't know whether they would know or not. He's not home a lot. 

00:06:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, the kids, the kids in the neighborhood would know and so they would, they would tell them. That's how kids are. 

00:06:50
CARLEEN Well, I don't know that they would know because we keep them pretty sheltered. You know, my husband doesn't want us out in, in the public too, too much because you know, the press and the paparazzi and all that. I, I just want you to make him not cheat on me. 

00:07:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. Well, that's a certainly, a nice thing to want. But, uh, do you, do you think that a lot of famous men and politicians and everyone around the world cheat on their wives? 

00:07:35
CARLEEN Well, they seem to. I mean, it seems like every time you turn around somebody's in the news, you know. And even if you were not famous, he would be, it would be awful. I mean, I don't, I don't know how these women deal with it. I, I try to fathom what I would do and I think one minute I would, I would, I, I imagine myself killing him. 

00:08:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:08:10
CARLEEN And in next minute I imagine myself being the martyr and staying with him. 

00:08:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:08:15
CARLEEN And. . . 

00:08:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You're not suicidal are you? You don't want to kill yourself? 

00:08:20
CARLEEN No, I'm not that upset. 

00:08:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. Good. So . . . 

00:08:30
CARLEEN But I'm m-, I guess I'm, I'm more angry at this whole situation. It just really, it really makes me angry to think that. . . 

00:08:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. Well, how did you find out about this thing? 

00:08:45
CARLEEN Find out about him? 

00:08:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Find out about him or if he's cheating or anything else. This is a, he's a public figure so. . . 

00:08:55
CARLEEN Yeah. I just, I just, he says it's my imagination. 

00:09:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:09:00
CARLEEN It's just that I'm making this up. 

00:09:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:09:00
CARLEEN And it's something that I should just stop doing. And he's getting angrier and angrier at me. And my marriage is very important to me. And I, in my wildest dreams I can't think of not being married to him. I love him and I, I, I just want you to help me stop worrying. 

00:09:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, I want you to stop worrying but I think that you believe that even if he's a famous man, like maybe he is or he isn't, we don't want to mention the name of him. But, uh, do you think that this is uncommon. For example, can you think of a, of a woman whose, there's a country song about that, I'm sticking by my man or something like that. 

00:09:50
CARLEEN Yeah. Stand By My Man. 

00:09:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yeah. 

00:09:55
CARLEEN I mean, that's what I want to be able to do. 

00:10:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well. . . 

00:10:00
CARLEEN But I just can't see myself doing that. In one breath I can, I'm just so tortured. I'm so in conflict with myself. One minute I, I want to be of a, a martyr and, and you know just really beso understanding and keep. . . 

00:10:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, well what's gonna change? This is important. What's gonna change in your life if you found out he was cheating about you? He claims he's not. Does he treat you well most of the time? 

00:10:30
CARLEEN Oh, yeah. He's treats me really well. I mean he's very good to me. 

00:10:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD So what would happen to you, what would happen to you if he said to him, well I would, once in a while I treat but I still wanna cheat. But once in a while I, I still, I still do it but. . . 

00:10:55
CARLEEN You mean if he would say to me you know I. . . 

00:11:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD But he wants you. He loves you and he wants the children, everything else. He wants to keep the family together. 

00:11:00
CARLEEN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:11:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And the family doesn't have to, they don't have to separate or come apart if husband or wife cheats or if they both cheat. They, if they want to keep together they would have a lot of company. 

00:11:25
CARLEEN Well that's a thought but I don't understand and. . . 

00:11:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I, I read a little history in my life. I'm still bit of a history and there's a Prime Minister of England that wrote a long time ago that he's the second that he's known 12 Prime Ministers of England, and he's known 12 of them. And 11 of them cheated on their wife and still remain Prime Minister and everything else. That's how it, that's how it happens. 

00:11:55
CARLEEN Here's this, here's this tissue. You seem to be crying too. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No, I'm not crying for you because this is a very common thing. Can I mention a name of a woman that stands by her man, and very famous woman? 

00:12:15
CARLEEN Yeah. I think it's Hillary Clinton. 

00:12:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Hillary Clinton. That's right. 

00:12:20
CARLEEN I know. I, believe me I've read about all of this. 

00:12:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:12:20
CARLEEN I, I get the tabloids. I read all the stories about them. I'm obsessed with it. 

00:12:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. Well. . . 

00:12:30
CARLEEN And I don't, I don't want to be. I don't want to be obsessed. I don't want him to cheat. 

00:12:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:12:40
CARLEEN I don't want to not be married. 

00:12:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. 

00:12:40
CARLEEN I don't, I don't know what I want though, you know. 

00:12:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, one thing you know that I teach and I think you know that, uh, you want to be happy. You know what happiness is? 

00:12:55
CARLEEN Uh, I wish. Yeah I, I, I kind of can guess what happiness is. 

00:13:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Uh-huh. 

00:13:00
CARLEEN But what is it? 

00:13:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Happiness is when you have a good relationship with someone and you stand around. You stayed with this man a while and he, even though he may be imperfect he may be better than any other man you can meet. 

00:13:20
CARLEEN Well, to me he is. I mean, he really, as far as I know, he, he really hasn't done anything. It, it's just that there's something amiss. 

00:13:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:13:30
CARLEEN There's something rotten in Denmark. I don't know, I can't put my finger on it. Is it me? 

00:13:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No. I think you're acting perfectly normally. 

00:13:45
CARLEEN You do? 

00:13:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD But you're asking . . . yes I, yes you are acting normally. But, but the fact of the matter is we live in a world where human beings are different from any other creatures. For example, if your husband were a dog and a cat you wouldn't be worried about this. And he is, he isn't a dog or a cat. 

00:14:10
CARLEEN And they . . . but they, they, but they, they're not people. We're people. You know people have. . . 

00:14:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I know you're people. All I'm saying is that what you are is first, perfectly normal person who wants to have a happy marriage and wants your husband not to cheat. And is there any way you can get around just a part of it by kind of saying to him, Well I love you. I care for you. And I don't want you to cheat on me. And does he admit he cheats on you? He hasn't . . . 

00:14:45
CARLEEN No. No. 

00:14:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD He doesn't admit it. 

00:14:50
CARLEEN He won't admit it. 

00:14:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yeah. 

00:14:50
CARLEEN I, I, I do tell him I love him. 

00:14:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD He's kind of silent about it? Right? 

00:14:55
CARLEEN I tell him I love him. I tell him all that but I don't wanna, you know, be a doormat . . . 

00:15:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:15:00
CARLEEN . . . or let him walk all over me. So I just tell. . . 

00:15:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well. . . 

00:15:00
CARLEEN (crosstalk) I also tell him things he does wrong. 

00:15:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yeah. Well. . . 

00:15:05
CARLEEN You know, I mean, I, I kind of am hypersensitive to the things that he does that irritate me. . . 

00:15:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:15:10
CARLEEN . . . because I just have this feeling about him that, there's just something not right and, and I don't know quite how to, I can't put my finger on it. 

00:15:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, I'm here to counsel you and help you. 

00:15:25
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:15:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And the first thing that you have to do is to say kind of what would I, would I be any better without this man? Would I do better without him? 

00:15:40
CARLEEN Well. . . 

00:15:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD He says he loves you. He says, he doesn't admit he's cheating on you but he says to you, you're crazy. Well you're not crazy. 

00:15:50
CARLEEN Mm-hmm. 

00:15:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You, you have a perfectly good reason to be upset but. . . 

00:15:55
CARLEEN (crosstalk) Yeah I'm worried. 

00:16:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD But what, the only one that can do something about it is something that I teach, which is you can only control yourself. You can't control any other person and that's why in that way animals are different from people. That's why. . . 

00:16:15
CARLEEN (crosstalk) Well I. . . 

00:16:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) If you had a, a nice little dog or a cat. . . 

00:16:20
CARLEEN I know. 

00:16:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD . . . the cat maybe is gonna be, run around a little bit but the dog will be okay. 

00:16:25
CARLEEN I, I know that, I know that already but I, I wanna know if, if you're saying that I can only control myself. 

00:16:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Right. 

00:16:35
CARLEEN I, I don't like that. I, because I feel like I should be able to make him be true to me because it, it's about, it's my ego. It's about me. 

00:16:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:16:50
CARLEEN It's about being good enough. 

00:16:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well you came, you came to me as a counselor. And since I can only counsel you, your, your husband isn't here. Perhaps I could do marital counseling if he was here but I don't think that would change anything. 

00:17:10
CARLEEN No, it's, it's not, it's not him. I mean, I know I, I know there's something wrong with me and I know that's why he's gonna cheat on me. 

00:17:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD There's nothing wrong with you. 

00:17:20
CARLEEN Yes there is. There's gotta be. If I, if I felt more confident in myself I wouldn't be worried about him cheating on me. I would think that I'm good enough and, and no other woman. And, and then I think, this is really stupid. You're being naÃ¯ve. Of course other women are prettier than you. Of course other women are better than you. And then I start to think everybody's better than me. And. . . 

00:17:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, first of all, how is your financial situation? Are you. . . 

00:17:50
CARLEEN Oh, really good. 

00:17:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You're really good. 

00:17:55
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:17:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You're, you're a wealthy person. 

00:17:55
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:17:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Known in the public. Might know you and, uh. . . 

00:18:00
CARLEEN But money isn't everything. Money is. . . 

00:18:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Money isn't everything at all but it's a pretty, a part of something. 

00:18:05
CARLEEN No it's very good. I mean. . . 

00:18:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD What do, what do poor women do when their husband cheats on them? Absolutely poor. 

00:18:10
CARLEEN Well, they get a gun and shoot them I guess. I don't know. 

00:18:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:18:15
CARLEEN I mean, I wish I could do that. 

00:18:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:18:20
CARLEEN But then I'd be in the media and then they'd be making jokes about me. Remember that Bobbet(ph) woman. Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna put myself in that position. But I, I put myself in that position every day by thinking about it. And I get these thoughts in my head of violent behaviors. I get these thoughts in my head that I'm out of control. 

00:18:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. 

00:18:45
CARLEEN And you say I can only control myself. I can't control myself. I'm out of control. My thinking is out of control. My body's out of control. I'm shaking all the time. I'm just, I don't know what to tell you. It's just driving me nuts. 

00:19:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:19:00
CARLEEN And that's what my husband says, "You're nuts." 

00:19:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. Well, I can tell you one thing. 

00:19:10
CARLEEN What? 

00:19:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD That whether he's cheating on you or not, there's nothing you can do about it that I can tell you. I'd like to tell you something. I'd like to say if you dance the hula or something like that he'll stop cheating, but he won't. 

00:19:30
CARLEEN Okay so what, I can't control him. 

00:19:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No. You can. . . 

00:19:30
CARLEEN I can only control me. 

00:19:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You can control you and you can, chances are your children are small, you can control them but not forever you can't control them. When you can't control anyone else actually you, you have to learn to control yourself. 

00:19:50
CARLEEN Yeah, I know but how can I stop worrying? 

00:19:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, worrying isn't such a bad thing to do. It's really not such a bad thing to do. Lot of people worry. You know how to worry, that's for sure. 

00:20:00
CARLEEN I know I know how to worry. Why isn't that a bad. . . 

00:20:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You're practically pretty good at worrying. 

00:20:10
CARLEEN Yeah but it doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel good to worry. It doesn't feel good to, I mean, you said, you talked about happiness. I want to be happy. 

00:20:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. Well. . . 

00:20:20
CARLEEN I'm not happy. I'm just not happy. There's something wrong and it, if it's not me, then it's gotta be him. 

00:20:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well your, your, you say something pretty, for me hard to contradict. It's gotta be him. 

00:20:40
CARLEEN Well, it's gotta be somebody. Unhappiness is unhappiness. And if it's there, somebody's gotta be doing something wrong. 

00:20:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, can you look at some of the public figures like Hillary Clinton. So, how do they deal with it? 

00:20:55
CARLEEN I don't know, she must be a saint. 

00:20:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD What? 

00:20:55
CARLEEN She's, she's got to be a saint because I don't know, I, now here she is the Secretary of State and she's, I don't, I'm just not that good. I'm not, I'm not as strong as she is. 

00:21:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You're not, you're not, you're not as strong as she is but she is not a saint. She just begins to live her life with or without her husband. And if he's around and they're getting along well, she enjoys it. And she's running around in the world a lot. She's the Secretary of State of the United States and has to do a lot of traveling probably sometimes with her husband, mostly without her husband. So I can only kinda tell you that other women can deal with it and kind of look at history books as how they do it and maybe you can learn something. 

00:21:50
CARLEEN I read about, um, Josephine Bonaparte and how, I read a whole series of books about her life and everything and, and she ended up getting the shaft in the end, too. I mean, I think that's the whole thing. That's the fate of women. I mean we, we end up getting the shaft. We end up on the short end of the stick, so to speak. I mean, men have got everything. 

00:22:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, if that's the source, that's the short end. . . 

00:22:25
CARLEEN I'm really furious at men. You know I really hate men. [00:22:30 ]I'm really getting sick of them having all the power. 

00:22:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD But the thing is that, uh, you can't change yourself from being a woman to being anyone else. 

00:22:40
CARLEEN I wouldn't want to be a man. 

00:22:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. 

00:22:40
CARLEEN No I'm, I'm. . . 

00:22:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, you have a few other choices but mostly you're, you're choosing to be a woman and you like being a woman and you like your children. You like your family. You like being rich and if. . . 

00:22:55
CARLEEN Well I like laying guilt trips on him too because I get more jewelry. 

00:23:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Uh-huh. 

00:23:00
CARLEEN It's . . 

00:23:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yeah, well I'm sure that right now. . . 

00:23:05
CARLEEN I mean it's a fact of life. You've gotta do something. 

00:23:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Right now there's probably, I, I ,I would state that if you ask your husband right now for a nice piece of jewelry, he'd be open to that suggestion. 

00:23:20
CARLEEN Yeah, he would. 

00:23:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:23:20
CARLEEN He, he's very generous. 

00:23:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Except don't ask for an opal. That's a bad luck piece. 

00:23:25
CARLEEN Okay. 

00:23:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD But other jewelry are pretty good. 

00:23:30
CARLEEN Well, I'll tell ya, you know it's, it's a two-sided coin here though. I, I, I, ask him for a piece of jewelry when I suspect that he's doing something and then when he gets it for me I think, yeah right. Now see I'm right, he is cheating on me because he got me the jewelry, didn't he. 

00:23:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:23:50
CARLEEN You know and that's, see it's telltale sign when they come home with flowers and they're real nice to you and all that. Then that's a time when you have to be suspicious. That's what my mother always said. 

00:24:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. Well, let's go through another little, uh, thing here. . . 

00:24:05
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:24:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD . . . which is how about getting a divorce? 

00:24:10
CARLEEN Huh. No because I. . . 

00:24:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You, you, I mean, I can point out there. . . 

00:24:15
CARLEEN . . . because I like my life the way. . . 

00:24:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No you don't like your life the way it is. And if you're unhappy with the man and you're rich, go to a good divorce lawyer and you'll really get a good settlement. 

00:24:35
CARLEEN Yeah, but don't you care if I save myself and save my marriage? 

00:24:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I care. I, I'm trying to do all I can do to help you. And you're in a world where rich men and maybe some rich women, I don't know, but rich men publicly in a certain sense cheat on their wives even if they don't admit it. The newspapers are after them and, uh, and your husband is from what I understand a very rich man. 

00:25:10
CARLEEN Yeah, and, and pretty famous and, and they would just make mincemeat out of us if, if the press got a hold of this, you know. And I, I. . . 

00:25:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No, the press can't hurt you. The press. . . 

00:25:20
CARLEEN What do you mean the press can't hurt me? 

00:25:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD The press can't hurt you. The press can't hurt your husband. All the press can do is hang around the house and, and take a picture here or there. And they'll stop hanging around the house. 

00:25:40
CARLEEN (crosstalk)So what are you saying? 

00:25:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD They get tired of hanging around the house and they look for someone else to hang around his house or their house. 

00:25:50
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:25:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And that's probably. . . 

00:25:50
CARLEEN Well, I know this stuff, kind of stuff doesn't have a very long shelf life but I just, I don't wanna, I don't wanna do that. I don't want to get a divorce. I don't want to stay married. I don't wanna have him cheat. I don't wanna be this kind of person. I don't wanna worry. I, I, I don't want to do any of these things and I came here because my husband said you'd fix that. 

00:26:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:26:15
CARLEEN So fix me. 

00:26:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. Okay. I can't, in a certain sense, I can't fix you but I've alerted you that the situation in a world where there's a lot a woman like yourself and a lot of men like your husband - wealthy people who can afford to get a divorce. Some of them get divorced and some of them don't. But my advice to you would be probably you'll be unhappier if you divorce him. And this kind of man, quickly on the rebound, you think there's other women who will marry him? 

00:27:00
CARLEEN Oh yeah, in a heartbeat. 

00:27:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:27:00
CARLEEN Just in a second, in a nanosecond. So there'd be somebody else in line. 

00:27:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. So staying. . . 

00:27:05
CARLEEN (crosstalk) But I don't wanna think that he's that kind of person. 

00:27:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Well. . . 

00:27:10
CARLEEN I wanna think he's a good person but. . . 

00:27:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) He may be a good person in a lot of respects but he has faults. 

00:27:15
CARLEEN He is a good person. Are you saying that he's not a good person? 

00:27:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I'm not saying that he's a good person. You're saying that you don't like him doing what he does. 

00:27:25
CARLEEN He's not doing anything. I don't know, I mean, he says he's not doing anything and I say. . . 

00:27:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You say you believe him? 

00:27:40
CARLEEN Do I believe him? 

00:27:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yes. 

00:27:45
CARLEEN I want to. I wanna believe him. I, I wanna fix this thing. 

00:27:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well. . . 

00:27:50
CARLEEN I wanna fix it today. Is that okay? 

00:27:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD That's fine. It's up to me. I'm a counselor. I give people advice all the time and. . . 

00:28:00
CARLEEN Well, what kind of advice can you give somebody like me who's just worrying all the time? 

00:28:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I say make up your mind whether he is A, B, C or D. He's better off with you and you're better off with him than you would be without him. That's my advice. And if you decide to stay with him I'll continue to see you a few times but I can't come up with much right now than telling you this bit of advice. I mean, I can you know, there, you can go to, sometimes I heard of some people that go to a psychoanalysis when this happens and they work 30 years or 40 years with the analyst and he gets rich and they're a rich person, they can afford it. But, uh, generally I think that I'm telling you that you should stick with your husband. . . 

00:28:55
CARLEEN (crosstalk) Stick with him and work on this? 

00:29:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD . . . and support him. If the papers get in there or if the press or whatever does anything and they see you sticking with him they'll go away because they're looking for what they call scandal or something like that. And you're, you're looking for something that isn't available to you. And you came to me to see if I could tell you what's available. And I'm telling you two things you could do is, one you stay with him. And if they come around get a nice sign in your front door, I'm sticking with my husband ha ha ha. 

00:29:40
CARLEEN (laughing)Uh, it's really you know, kind of you know strange advice but. . . 

00:29:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Why is it strange? 

00:29:55
CARLEEN Well, I mean, it just seems so hard to do. That's why, because. . . 

00:30:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You have all the things in your life that you want except the fact that maybe your husband is cheating on you. And he. . . 

00:30:05
CARLEEN Is he? Do you think he is? 

00:30:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I, I have no idea. I could mention a few names but I don't know if they're cheating. 

00:30:20
CARLEEN (laughing) 

00:30:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD They don't come to me and say you know, help me because I'm cheated on my wife. I've never had anyone come like that to me and I've been doing counseling for 50 years. So that would be a first but if it happens I'll, I'll, I'll work with it. 

00:30:35
CARLEEN Yeah. Well, here you've got me. 

00:30:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:30:40
CARLEEN You've got me now and here I sit wondering how to feel good about myself when I don't. How to. . . 

00:30:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Well you have to do what other women do. That's, that's their role models for this and you mentioned Hillary Clinton. She's a good role model. There's probably a lot of them besides her. But, uh, she's a very good role model of a woman that's stuck by her man. 

00:31:10
CARLEEN Yeah, but a lot of people think she shouldn't have. A lot of think, lot of women . . . 

00:31:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Well what's the difference what people say? I'm counseling you, not what people say. That's not important. 

00:31:25
CARLEEN Yeah, see now that's my whole hang up. I'm so worried about what people are going to say and. . . 

00:31:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well do you think Hillary Clinton worries about people saying things? 

00:31:30
CARLEEN No, she doesn't, I don't think. I, I don't know what she thinks. 

00:31:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) I don't know what she thinks. 

00:31:35
CARLEEN Who knows what she. . . 

00:31:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) They impeached her husband or something and they tried to do all kinds of things and she stuck with him and now she's the Secretary of State. So that's not a bad come out for that. 

00:31:50
CARLEEN Well, she almost got to be president so that, that was something too. 

00:31:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well that's one thing we haven't gotten so far as a woman president, but we're close. 

00:32:00
CARLEEN Well, you aren't gonna see me doing it. I just, I just need to get some kind of assurance from you that this is solvable. Is this something that can be solved or not? 'Cuz 

00:32:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Sure it can be solved - making up your mind that you're gonna stick with your husband and stick with the, him regardless of what's going on. And that probably is the best thing you could do in this situation. I'd be happy if your husband didn't cheat on you but I'm convinced that the world is filled with men that cheat on their wives and probably filled with women that cheat on their husbands. So. . . 

00:32:45
CARLEEN But you're saying that doesn't make any difference. It's how you deal with it? 

00:32:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yeah, it makes a difference how you deal with it. 

00:32:50
CARLEEN Well. . . 

00:32:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Like I say put up a sign right in front of your house and maybe you got a neon sign going on, make it loud. "My husband is cheating on me and I don't give a shit." 

00:33:05
CARLEEN (laughing) 

00:33:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I mean, it's a little bit of a bad word but it's a good, good word in that situation. It'll, it'll stall these paparazzi or whatever the hell they are. They'll go away. 

00:33:20
CARLEEN (laughing) 

00:33:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You just keep the sign, the neon sign going. Plug it in and keep it going. 

00:33:30
CARLEEN (laughing)Okay, well I got a good laugh out of that. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And you could come to see me maybe. . . 

00:33:35
CARLEEN (crosstalk) I do wanna stay with him. I do, I do wanna stay with him 'cuz if I didn't I wouldn't be here. 

00:33:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, you're a very rich woman so I'll be happy to continue to see you. 

00:33:45
CARLEEN (crosstalk) And it's not about. . . 

00:33:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I know many men who stick with their wives and everything like that and, and you make a . . . 

00:34:00
CARLEEN (crosstalk) My husband says he's gonna stick with me. 

00:34:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I know he's gonna stick with you. 

00:34:05
CARLEEN He says he's a good guy. And he says why don't you believe me? Why don't you believe me that I'm . . . 

00:34:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well they'll believe you if you put up a sign in front of the house in neon and, and say, I don't give a shit about you guys. I'll say it again. I'm gonna stick with this man and that's the way it is. So when you want to come on I come on every, every Wednesday night and I'll light the sign up and you can look and take pictures of it and everything else. Maybe it will help. Good advice. 

00:34:40
CARLEEN (laughing) Well, I guess it is good advice. But what am I gonna do. Can, can I just work on, in this therapy on me? 

00:34:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, what's wrong? There's nothing wrong with you. I'm happy to see you and you're a rich woman but there is nothing wrong with you. 

00:35:00
CARLEEN You say, you say there's nothing wrong with me, are you sure? I, I think you should diagnose me with something. 

00:35:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Does your husband kind of once in a while say I've got some psychiatric drugs that maybe you should take? 

00:35:15
CARLEEN No, I went to a doctor for all the shaking that I have, you know. 

00:35:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:35:15
CARLEEN I get real nervous and I shake. 

00:35:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:35:20
CARLEEN And they put me on some medicine. 

00:35:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Then they make you shake worse. 

00:35:25
CARLEEN No, it calmed the shaking down but I was like a zombie. And, and my eyes, my cornea, then my eyes dried and it was terrible. 

00:35:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, well you've gotta. . . 

00:35:35
CARLEEN There's all these side effects, you know. 

00:35:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD There is no such thing as side effects. There's effects or no effects. Side effects are something that the drug companies use to sell drugs that'll harm people. 

00:35:50
CARLEEN Well, I stopped taking them and I don't care, I, about, my husband doesn't want me to take drugs either. I just went to the doctor to make sure that I wasn't sick and he said I'm not sick and they did every test on me. And it's just that I've got a chronic case of worrying and fidgeting. 

00:36:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:36:15
CARLEEN And, um, I'm afraid that if I don't stop doing this my husband is gonna leave me and that's what my real scary part of my, my, my session here is, that if I don't stop being the way I am I'm gonna be rejected and lost. 

00:36:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD You'll be, you'll be a good wife who stuck by her husband. And if other people are telling you you're not, that's their problem not yours. 

00:36:45
CARLEEN Nobody's telling me except me. I'm telling myself I'm not good. 

00:36:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay. 

00:36:50
CARLEEN I'm telling myself that I'm flawed and, and that I, I'm not worthy of, of having him. 

00:36:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, I've gotten to know you a little bit in this period of time and I think that you're not flawed at all. I think you're a good person and you should think you're a good person. And if you want to come to see me, I'll see you once or twice more and I'll reinforce that, but. . . 

00:37:15
CARLEEN Well, I wanna see you more. I think it's important for me to talk to you about all these feelings I have. 

00:37:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) And, and, and what I want to do is, there is such a thing as pro bono, that's means with no charge. 

00:37:30
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:37:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I'll see you without any charge because you can use your money to help all the people in the world that need help. I, I, I'll see you without money because I don't want to be another person that preys on the fact that you're a good woman. 

00:37:45
CARLEEN Oh. Well that's nice. I'd be happy to pay you. I can afford it. 

00:37:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yes, you can so. . . 

00:37:55
CARLEEN But I can donate it to charity? Is that what you're saying? 

00:37:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Oh, yeah donate it to charity or buy jewelry, whatever you wanna do. 

00:38:00
CARLEEN But I want you to, I do, I do need somebody to talk like this to. I need somebody that will listen just to me and not think I'm crazy. 

00:38:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay, I'll see you free of charge once a week for six months. Not once a week, once a month for six months. 

00:38:25
CARLEEN (laughing)I didn't think you were that generous. 

00:38:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No. 

00:38:30
CARLEEN Okay. But is once a month enough? 

00:38:35
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, it is for that pill Actonel that gives, that, that I see about it in the, in the TV ads. You only have to take it once a month. So . . . 

00:38:45
CARLEEN Oh, that's like for your bones. 

00:38:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD For your bones. 

00:38:50
CARLEEN (crosstalk)Well, I've got something wrong with my psychiatric bones. 

00:38:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Okay.) 

00:38:55
CARLEEN There's something wrong. . . 

00:38:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, once a month will be more than enough for. . . 

00:39:00
CARLEEN Okay. Well, I don't feel like we solved anything today. I mean, I can get it, I'm not gonna get a neon sign. Let's forget that. But I know what you mean metaphorically it's a neon sign in my brain. But I feel like I wanna talk about, you know, shouldn't I be talking about my childhood and about my parenting and all of that? 

00:39:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Not with me you can't. I only talk about you, you and you. That the three people that I talk about - you, you and you. 

00:39:45
CARLEEN Okay. 

00:39:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And I look forward to seeing you and I think we'll get along well together. And you're a rich woman so spend your money on other things that may help the world more than I do. And I've, you've got a man that's seen a lot of people without charging them money and some people have paid me pretty good money. But I'll make the deal with you, once a month come to see me, and you can look forward to seeing me and I look forward to seeing you. 

00:40:15
CARLEEN Can I ask you a question? 

00:40:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yes. 

00:40:20
CARLEEN Why are you doing that? Why are you saying you'll see me for free? 

00:40:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, because you told me you're a very wealthy woman. 

00:40:30
CARLEEN Yeah but wouldn't you want to charge me more? That's what everybody else does. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Then, then, then. . . 

00:40:35
CARLEEN I mean why would you do that? Why would you say. . . 

00:40:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Because I want to see you for free so that people don't criticize me. You've got a wealthy woman for a patient and you're charging her a lot of money and I don't want to see that criticism so I'll see you free of charge, pro bono, whatever they call it. 

00:40:55
CARLEEN So it's more about you than it's about me. 

00:41:00
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Certainly. 

00:41:10
CARLEEN You know, you're really strange. I've never in my entire life met anybody like you. How, how did you get to be like this? I mean, you don't want to charge me money . . . 

00:41:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:41:25
CARLEEN . . . and that feels good but it kind of feels like pressure to me. 

00:41:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Mm-hmm. 

00:41:35
CARLEEN You know it feels like, uh-oh he's not charging me any money now. Hmm. And I can come here for free once a month and just say anything I want. 

00:41:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD For half an hour. 

00:41:50
CARLEEN Oh, how come I can't have an hour for free? 

00:41:55
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I can't explain that but I just feel like you're a half hour person and I'll see you half an hour. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And since my half hour is up, I'd like to close the role-play. Thank you very much. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:25
CARLEEN That is absolutely the strangest role play I have ever made up. (laughing) I'm making this thing up as I go along. 

00:42:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I think, I think, we have a session sometime. . . 

00:42:35
CARLEEN At 5:10. 

00:42:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD At 5:10. 

00:42:40
CARLEEN Yeah. We're gonna talk about choice theory and reality therapy at length. 

00:42:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And that's, I think the session is called 'Conversations with Dr. Glasser and His Wife Carleen'. 

00:42:45
CARLEEN Yeah. 

00:42:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) because I, I really need someone else because I'm, I'm recovering from big-deal bypass surgery and Carleen does a lot of good things for me. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And tell you don't worry about me dying because I've got four new arteries in my heart and that's a big, big, big improvement. 

00:43:20
CARLEEN And I am thrilled to keep him forever if I can. 

00:43:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Thank you very much. 

00:43:25
CARLEEN Do we have time to field any questions if anybody . . . we have 15 minutes if there's anyone who has a question about, um . . . 

00:43:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Who, question a very peculiar psychiatrist. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN I do. 

00:43:50
CARLEEN Yes. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Um, first of all I wanna say you're a wonderful, wonderful client. Thank you. 

00:43:55
CARLEEN Thank you. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN My question is how, how, how faithful is this to what you actually do? I couldn't, couldn't tell how much you were burlesquing for the audience and how much this is really you. 

00:44:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Well, I've done what I do for probably 50 years and I've worked at it all the time and Carleen told me she wanted to do a role-play and I knew there'd be a few people in the room which there is, so I did it. But if there was only one person in the audience I would do it, too. And I often see people without asking much money from them because unlike many people in this world, I've saved considerable amount of money. A, a client of mine whose sister I fell in love with, oh, many, many years ago and she married the other guy who was off in the navy and when he back he married her. And I was really upset about that. But in the meantime, her little brother became a very good accountant and he said to me, what I have to do is set you up with a good retirement plan and everything like that. And free of charge I saw him for a period of time and he had a little problem in his life and I helped him with that. So it was a good trade-off so I do what I do and I think I do it reasonably well. But, uh . . . 

00:45:35
CARLEEN And it's always the unexpected. You're never gonna see the same old same old with Dr. William Glasser. 

00:45:40
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yeah, well I won't. . . 

00:45:45
CARLEEN His, his theories. . . 

00:45:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:45:45
CARLEEN and his, and his techniques. 

00:45:45
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Wait, wait. I'm getting 10, so there's 10 more minutes. Another question please. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Yes. Thank you Dr. Glasser. I notice that as you were going through the role-play that you used a lot of interruptions with the client, interrupting her at various points, and I was wondering if you. . . 

00:46:05
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And I didn't look her in the eye at all. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Yeah I did notice that, as well. I was wondering regarding the interruptions if there was a specific methodology that you used to decide when and how to interrupt her. 

00:46:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I can't hear you. What? 

00:46:20
CARLEEN He wants to know, let me translate. He wants to know if there was a rhyme or reason, or a specific method for your interruptions. Did you interrupt me because. . . 

00:46:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I, I, I only could do what I did, if I see her again I might do it differently. But basically I try to get involved with the client and give her some advice and that, that, that's what I did today and I, maybe other people would give other advice. But I have nothing against giving advice somewhere along the line. People say you shouldn't give advice to your clients, I don't understand that. They're coming to you for advice, give it to them. Why not? 

00:47:05
CARLEEN We don't have to take it, right? 

00:47:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD No. I'm reasonably good at it. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:47:15
CARLEEN (laughing) 

00:47:15
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD And if the audience laughs at me, that's their benefit. 

00:47:20
CARLEEN Laughter is healthy. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:47:25
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Yes. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Why is it that you don't look at her. 

00:47:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I never look the client in the eye. I never have in all the years I have because you can't think when you're looking other people in the eye. So I look away and some people, I feel like I'm a, I don't know what, but I can't do that 

00:47:50
CARLEEN Once in a while though when he wants to really zero in. . . 

00:47:50
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD Oh yeah, I'll look you in the eye and turn away. 

00:47:50
CARLEEN (crosstalk) And make a point. He, he, he narrows, he hammers down a point by turning and looking you square in the eye. And then he'll make that point. And it's, it's really quite effective when you're in the therapy itself, when you're the client because he, he doesn't get into your face until he has to. And that's his technique. And I don't know why he does it that way. 

00:48:20
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD I saw a really wealthy woman once who, who I saw her family, too. And so she wanted to come in to see me and they were very rich. I mean, unbelievably rich people. I don't know, they might not have been a billionaire but they were very close to it. And what I did after she came in to see me, she was so absolutely obnoxious that I couldn't stand seeing her and I didn't want to tell her that she was that obnoxious but I said, "I think you've gotten from me all I can give to you. Goodbye." 

00:49:00
CARLEEN That's kinda what he did to me too, as the client. Do you have any other questions? We have five minutes. Any other questions? Would you like to hear some feedback from me as the, as the client? 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:49:15
WILLIAM GLASSNER Sure. 

00:49:15
CARLEEN I felt that, um, he put me on the spot by, um, letting me know that my, I'm the only one that can control my own behavior and that I can't control him, I can't control my husband. Nor would he allow me to control him the therapist. It, it kind of took my, my external control urges and kind of corralled them to a, a place where I had to confront the real issues which the real issue would be myself. And then when I said it put me on the spot when he said he'd see me for free, I felt like, gee you know, now I really have to do something in return. I have to, I have to produce as the, as the client. I, iff he's gonna you know, do this gratis for me, what am I going to do for myself, I guess. And, and so it felt like he was always there supporting me but not letting me control him. And that's, that's typically Glasser style. Glasser's style is, is getting into your, your quality world. Getting, you know, getting you to see things in a, in a whole different way. I mean, it's an unusual, unexpected way of dealing with people. And injecting humor and things like that are, are very therapeutic because a couple of times he made me laugh or I chose to laugh. He didn't make me laugh. And, um, that was, that felt good to kind of laugh at myself or laugh at the situation. So it's, it's an unusual kind of therapy and we're gonna talk more about it at 5:00 or 5:10 over in the convention center. I think in ballroom C. And we really want to converse with people about this more and, and see, really delve into what is reality therapy and why does it in, it use the choice theory to, uh, base it, back it up. 

00:51:30
WILLIAM GLASSER, MD (crosstalk) Reality therapy merged with choice theory and eventually it's gonna merge with something I call public not private but public mental health. And they're gonna, the University of Loyola Marymount in, in Los Angeles is gonna actually start giving a degree in public mental health. And I'll explain to you what it is when you come at 5:10. 

00:52:00
CARLEEN Okay, is that our time up? Thank you very much. Thank you.
