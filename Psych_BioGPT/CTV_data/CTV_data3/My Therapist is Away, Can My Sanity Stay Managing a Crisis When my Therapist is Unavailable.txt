00:00:00
Kristi Kanel Ph.D. 

00:00:10
MARK ZETIN M.D. Hello, my name is Dr. Mark Zetin. I'm a psychiatrist in Orange County, California. We’ll be joined a little bit later by Dr. Kristi Kanel, Professor of Psychology at Cal State, Fullerton. Our program today, “My therapist is away, will my sanity stay?” How to cope with crisis during times when your therapist is unavailable. 

00:00:30
This Program Includes… A Brief Overview Of… What Is A Crisis? How To Cope With Crises… Successfully! Series Of Real Patient Interviews 

00:00:30
MARK ZETIN Our program will include a brief overview of what is a crisis? How do people cope with crises successfully? We will have a series of real patient interviews. We hope that you will learn a lot about how to deal with your crisis. The idea for this program came from many patients and clients who told us that a therapist’s vacation, sick leave, maternity leave was always at an inopportune time, a time when they wish they could have the therapist available. And some patients actually told us, I wish I could have a tape of what you would say to me during difficult times. The goal in producing this program is to help a person who is in crisis whose therapist is unavailable to make it through the tough times. What we will do is explain in simple terms what psychotherapy is and how it helps people and how crisis counseling is a very specialized form of psychotherapy. We’ll talk about the definition of crisis, what its impact is on a person's life? How to minimize that impact by planning ahead and with the meaning the coping styles, the issues are in dealing with crisis? We will show you some real live examples of people who have dealt with major life crisis and we’ll talk about the options, the actions, the choices that you’ll have when dealing with a crisis that may promote growth, adaptation and leave you better off than when you started. 

00:02:15
Using This DVD And Book 

00:02:15
MARK ZETIN In terms of how to use this DVD and the book, we have some suggestions. First listen to this introduction. Whenever we come to a point we used to say ah… huh… that really applies to me, stop the tape, write down the ideas, write down what might strike you as useful or helpful. Watch the videos of the people who actually have gone through a crisis, read through the accompanying booklet and especially the worksheets, take sometime, writing down your thoughts and your ideas on the worksheets. We are going to try to help you to explore new ways of coping and choosing actions to deal with the crisis. 

00:03:00
Useful Tips 

00:03:00
MARK ZETIN In order to do this, it’s very useful to write down thoughts and ideas on the worksheets that are in the book. This is your homework. Hopefully, you can share these with a trusted friend or family member who can give you some feedback. 

00:03:15
When Things Have Calmed… 

00:03:15
MARK ZETIN When things have calmed down a bit, watch the section on after the crisis. To really try to understand how you can incorporate what you’ve learned, how you’ve coped into newer and better strategies for dealing with future problems. 

00:03:30
A Word Of Caution 

00:03:35
MARK ZETIN This program does not substitute for having a psychotherapist. It’s a self help approach, designed to augment your psychotherapy. It will get you through a gap in therapy when your therapist is unavailable, but it doesn’t take the place of psychotherapy. 

00:03:50
Another Word Of Caution 

00:03:55
MARK ZETIN Another word of caution, if suicide is really looking like the best choice to cope with your problem now, please go to a hospital, talk to the mental health professional in the emergency room, go into the hospital for a few days until things settle down a little bit. That few days of gaining a perspective, talking to people, waiting till the emotions cool down a bit could save your life. 

00:04:20
Before Your Therapist Goes Away… 

00:04:20
MARK ZETIN Before your therapist goes away, think carefully about who are the other resources in your life? Does your family doctor, your clergy men, your best friend, your family member, your neighbor, offer support in rough times. 

00:04:40
Suicidal Feelings 

00:04:40
MARK ZETIN Suicidal feelings are one of the toughest things to deal with in a crisis. Often, they are the tunnel vision, the constriction of a person who sees no way out of their pain. It sometimes said that suicidal feelings are a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Suicide happens unfortunately when a person’s pain exceeds their coping resources. Often the passage of a little time, getting some distance from the situation, talking to people, can help the coping and get through a suicidal crisis. Suicide might look like an option, a solution, but there are always better ones available. It just takes a little time and distance to see what they are. 

00:05:40
Reduce The Risk Of Suicide 

00:05:40
MARK ZETIN If you’re having some suicidal feelings now, we’ll talk about how you can reduce the risk of actually hurting yourself. The first thing is get abusable drugs and alcohol out of the house. Give them to a friend, get rid of them. Alcohol and drugs of abuse can only worsen the situation, because they’ll make you more depressed even though they provide a momentary relief, in a long run you will feel more miserable if you use them and we would also ask get rid of guns or other means of suicide, get them out of the house, yet don’t want them there if you have a moment of intensive suffering when you might be attempted to use them. 

00:06:30
A Suicide Attempt 

00:06:30
MARK ZETIN A suicide attempt might be a desperate plea for someone else to take charge of my life. Put me away, take care of me, make my decisions for me, take over responsibility for my life. It might be a way to show someone how badly I’ve been hurt. No one can really take away suicide as an option, but it’s not a good option and a therapist and a support network can make it a very low priority choice. There is no mistake you have ever made, no problem you’ve ever encountered, no disgrace in life, no disappointment in life that justifies a death sentence. 

00:07:20
Stress Versus Crisis 

00:07:20
MARK ZETIN What’s a difference between a stress and a crisis? Healthy adaptation is growth and maturation in response to a life stress. Sometimes, a life stress is positive, it’s planned, it’s desired, do you want it to happen? It could be something like moving out of your parents’ house graduating high school, graduating college, living with a romantic partner or getting married. It could be having a baby, getting a job promotion, becoming a grandparent. These are stressors, but there are usually desired, planned for, wanted, they are things you can anticipate, they are things that lead to change in your life, but it’s usually a positive change. There are some stressors that are negative. They are not planned. They are not wanted. Things like a divorce, loosing a job, a death in a family, a car accident, a medical problem, facing illness or dementia in a relative. These are difficult to deal with stressors. A crisis, is a negative event plus distressing reactions to it and a sense of loss of psychological equilibrium, a sense that usual coping mechanisms don’t work. This is what separates a crisis from a stress. A key concept in dealing with crisis is that if we can change the perception of the situation and find something positive that may come out of it that may allow us to decrease the distress and function better. Another key concept, crises don’t go forever. They’re usually resolved in about four to six weeks and things settle down. 

00:09:25
Tolerating Change 

00:09:25
MARK ZETIN Tolerating change is an interesting concept. Some people seem to skate through life. Whatever problems life sends them, they face them with strength and optimism. They have a sense of self-confidence, happiness, self-esteem, probably they come from childhood experiences from our parents, from our early life, but we can enhance them as adults. Psychotherapy can help too. The initial concept of psychotherapy was to allow people to love and work. The modern version would add being able to play, find meaning, purpose, spirituality, a sense of balance in life and often handling a crisis means temporarily shifting our time, our energy our priorities among areas of our life that are really problematic to other areas that are going better. 

00:10:20
General Principles Of Psychotherapy 

00:10:25
MARK ZETIN The general principles of psychotherapy that you should understand are the… you have to have a relationship with someone that you trust and respect who tries to understand you in a nonjudgmental way and you have to explore it, talk about deal with feelings, thoughts, problems, behaviors with the optimism that you really can change those during the process of interacting with another person. 

00:10:55
Approaches To Psychotherapy 

00:10:55
MARK ZETIN There are several approaches to psychotherapy. There is cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic or psychoanalytic therapy, mindfulness acceptance and commitment therapies, and other forms and often medication is part of the big picture… 

00:11:20
Which Approach Is Right For Me? 

00:11:20
MARK ZETIN …which approach is right for me. We’re gonna try to describe a few of the major approaches to psychotherapy and as we do that, you might find that one approach really appeals to you more than others. If it does, ask your therapist if that‘s an approach that they can use with you. 

00:11:40
Cognitive Behavior 

00:11:40
MARK ZETIN Cognitive behavior therapy has become very popular, because there is a great deal of data showing that it’s widely applicable to mood, anxiety, substance use, even personality problems. The key concept in cognitive behavior therapy is that, the situation, the problem, the external event does not cause symptoms and suffering. It is how I think about it, what meaning I assign to that event that causes suffering and I can change the thoughts and the meanings I assign to those events. I can do that by taking a careful look at my core views, my major thoughts about myself, the world, the future. In order to do that, I have to become aware of what automatic thoughts get triggered by the events in my life and learn to challenge them and test them. Another concept is that I can define the desired outcome of a situation. I can list alternative choices. I can commit to taking some action. Finally, I can handle most problems that come in my way. Some of them are can be tougher than others. They can require more time, more effort, more energy, but I can handle them. 

00:13:05
Interpersonal Approach 

00:13:10
MARK ZETIN Disputes with other people are inevitable. Disputes about roles, responsibilities, often relied to stress and crisis. Relationships when they end, are very difficult for most people to handle, but I can learn skills for developing and sustaining relationships with other people. I can come to the point of understanding that it’s okay to be mad at someone, but they haven’t mad at me and it’s not the end of the relationship. All relationships have hassles. For example, the boss could he, lots and lots of work on me without giving me much help and I could either feel overwhelmed and suffer with that or I could say to him we need to have a talk. I need to set priorities. I need to know what’s really important and what’s not so important and where I can get some help in doing this. That kind of assertiveness can be taught in assertiveness training classes. Another concept is that a relationship might go bad, might have major problems and there is always a choice, do we make the attempt to fix it or is it time to call it quits? Either way, could be challenging difficult, but it could lead to a better life in a long run. Another concept is mindfulness, acceptance, commitment. Here, one learns that unpleasant feelings, pain, suffering are sometimes unavoidable in life. Feelings are like clouds in the sky. They’ll pass over, they are not forever. Symptoms, thoughts, even hallucinations are passing mental phenomena. They are not absolute truths about who I am. The idea that I can just be, I can be present, I can accept what is going on, I can accept the thoughts and feelings and not have to do anything about them immediately is a key concept here. The other key concept is that I can make careful, thoughtful decisions and long term commitments of what my life is going to be about what actions I will take and those decide who I truly am. 

00:15:50
The Classical Form Of Psychotherapy 

00:15:55
MARK ZETIN The classical form of psychotherapy psychodynamic or psychoanalytic psychotherapy basically says that what happened to me as a child whether it was good or bad, still has some influence on how I view people and how I view relationships now as an adult. The problems I face now have some historic forces that contributed to their development and their meaning. There are unconscious forces in my life that lead to internal conflicts, conflicts about what I want, conflicts about what I can get, conflicts about pleasure enjoyment what’s right and wrong, but I can make conscious decisions moral decisions, correct decisions for me and I don’t know how to act on these conflicts. All behavior has multiple factors influencing it, just as old dramas upsets problems might have some influence on my life now. 

00:16:55
The Flip Side 

00:16:55
MARK ZETIN The flip side of that is that people that I admire and respect as role models as I grew up. And people who have been my teachers, my helpers, my mentors as an adult, can be internalized. They can become my guiding voice in hard times. There is an existential approach to psychotherapy. Suffering, strengthens people, whatever doesn’t kill me, will strengthen me. Personal responsibility is a key issue. The problems I face now may be a result of my past bad choices. But I can only learn to make good choices by making bad choices, I’m learning from them. By having choices, I empower myself to make changes, to get through this crisis. 

00:17:45
Family Systems 

00:17:50
MARK ZETIN Another approach to psychotherapy involves family systems. Every family has its rules, its expectations, the role that each person is expected to fit into. Every family has its own level of closeness or distance. Very closed families may be nurturing supportive. They may even be unmatched where everyone is involved in everyone else’s business. Other families are very autonomy promoting sometimes to the point of distancing, disengaging from family members. There are family rules. There are cultural rules when a person violates those unspoken rules, that can lead to crisis in order to help resolve the crisis, it can be very helpful to have the whole family in for therapy. 

00:18:50
Crisis Intervention 

00:18:50
MARK ZETIN Crisis intervention is by definition brief time limited focused on an acute problem, focused on coping with that problem in the best possible way and restoring function. Crisis intervention, because its short term may lead to longer terms psychotherapy or may be a component of longer term psychotherapy. 

00:19:15
How To Prepare For A Crisis 

00:19:15
MARK ZETIN How do I prepare for crisis? Well, there are ways of being ready for life’s problems. One is to take a careful inventory who are the main support people in my life? Do I have a doctor, a clergy man, psychiatrist, counselor are important in my life? Is there a group of people that I meet with regularly people, who share an interest that could be a 12 step meeting? That could be bible study. That could mean people who share a hobby or an interest. Are there non-professional people who are part of my support system, parents, sibling, children, neighbors? Have I ever helped anyone get through a really rough time in the past? Would they help me if I needed it? Is a close friend I haven’t seen for a very long time? Should I give him a call, get together? How about contingency planning? Is there a foreseeable risk something would go bad at my job or in my relationship? What are the potential actions that I can take? How could I think it through ahead of time to prioritize what would be the best possible reaction if there was a problem? I’m planning for a quiet time it’s important too. Physical and emotional pain may be worst during quiet times evening, weekends, holidays, when feeling alone. Planning for some structured social enjoyable, leisure, recreational activities, things like exercise, religious activities, seeing friends, very important. It’s important to keep doing these things even if there is a crisis. 

00:21:10
Introspection 

00:21:15
MARK ZETIN Introspection can be a key component. Simply taking a little time to write down thoughts and feelings in a journal. Meditation, prayer, problem solving, creating a list of possible outcomes, all of these can help. The idea is that having some distance, some perspective, giving some careful thought to the problem can help with problem solving and decreasing the intensity of overwhelming feelings. 

00:21:50
Opportunity 

00:21:50
MARK ZETIN Crisis may be an opportunity, step back for a moment and ask is this the universe or God or you are in yourself, telling you this is time to get out of a rut and make a change. Make time for some radical thoughts if I were to really start over in my career, in my relationship, in my values, what have I learned, what would I want to do differently for the rest of my life? 

00:22:15
The ABC Approach 

00:22:20
MARK ZETIN Dr. Kanel has developed the ABC approach to crisis counseling. The first is developing, maintaining rapport, listening, questions, talking with, trying to understand the feelings and… 

00:22:30
A. Summarizing what happened in the crisis. B. Identifying the problems, the thoughts and feelings… C. Looking at positive coping mechanisms. 

00:22:30
MARK ZETIN …summarize what happened in the crisis. The second is identifying the problems with the events, the thoughts, the feelings, the risk of danger and providing some interaction, some education, some reframing, some sense of empowerment, some sense that it’s possible to reduce distress and increase function. And the third is to look at positive coping mechanisms and of course longer term referrals. 

00:22:55
Handling Crises 

00:23:00
MARK ZETIN General principles of how to handle crisis. One, how do… has this happened before? How do they cope with that? What did I try that was helpful? Did I call friends? Did I call on a few family members? Did I call my clergy man? Did I talk to my… talk to many people? Did I take a brief vacation to visit a friend or relative? What did I try that didn’t help? For example, getting drunk, isolating in my room for a week not talking to anyone, binge eating, suicide attempt or threat. Those things usually don’t help. What are my strengths in getting through the tough times that life sends me? What helps me to feel good, sports, exercise, classes, hobbies, religion, what are the things that make my life better? 

00:23:55
Psychological Factors 

00:24:00
MARK ZETIN Gary Beck(ph) wrote interesting paper on psychological factors in crisis management. Basically saying that people who do the best handle complex information in an open minded flexible, non-authoritarian way. He pointed out that people have different motivations when they deal with crisis. For some the goal is achievement. I want to do things better. For others, the goal is power. I want to control, I want to influence. Still others, affiliation, I want people to like me. I want to develop the relationship. What the goals are? Will influence the choice in how to cope with the problem? He pointed out that there are several different coping styles when dealing with crisis. 

00:24:50
Unconflicted Adherence 

00:24:55
MARK ZETIN Unconflicted adherence, I’ll do the same thing I’ve been doing, because it’s worked in the past and I will keep doing it regardless of any new information or input unconflicted change. 

00:25:05
Unconflicted Change Defensive Avoidance 

00:25:05
MARK ZETIN Doctor, lawyer, pastor, tell me what to do and I’ll do it defensive avoidance. I don’t want to take risk. I don’t want to make a decision if I just procrastinate and do nothing the situation will resolve on its own. 

00:25:20
Hypervigilance 

00:25:20
MARK ZETIN This Hypervigilance, a sense I’m so panicked. I’m so upset that I’ll take whatever hasty solution promises immediate relief. 

00:25:30
Vigilance 

00:25:30
MARK ZETIN And then finally, there is vigilance. I’ll seek all the relevant information I can get, or carefully appraise the alternatives and then I’ll choose a path of action. 

00:25:40
Hardiness 

00:25:45
MARK ZETIN Hardiness is a key concept in coping with crisis. A hardy individual looks at the situation and says this is a challenge. Hardy person says, I’m committed to purposeful activity. I’m going to solve this problem. A hardy person says, I have some control over the outcome. The decisions, the thoughts, the plans that I make will have an influence. And the person looks at change, is a challenge. Change is what makes life interesting. Hardy people tend to be less focused on disruptive thoughts and emotions and more focused on how I can solve the problem. In general, the greater, the stress level, the less likely you were to seek and process new information. The less likely you are to think about the long term outcome, and the more likely you are to be very stimulus bound and react in a very simple way. These are reasons when you are in crisis, to talk to other people who are not in crisis, because they can be a little bit more calm and objective in helping you to think about your choices. 

00:27:05
Define The Crisis 

00:27:05
MARK ZETIN So, let’s first define the crisis. You’ve had a crisis, what actually happened? Who did or said what? When? Where? What real thoughts and feelings about the crisis? What’s the meaning of the crisis? How will your life be different right now, next week, next month? What’s the best possible outcome if things go really well? What’s the worst possible outcome if they don’t go so well? What’s the likelihood of each of these? How many different choices of actions and coping styles can you think of and which one will give you the best chance of a good outcome? 

00:27:50
Reacting To A Crisis 

00:27:50
MARK ZETIN We have to react to a crisis. One concept is to be present in the moment to witness it, to accept it, to simply say this is what is right now and I will experience it. I’ll be in the moment without the necessity of acting on it. This is tough for many people. Our culture is very action oriented. But sometimes, experiencing without judgment, without blame, without criticism, is the first step in dealing with a crisis. 

00:28:30
Acknowledge The Thoughts 

00:28:30
MARK ZETIN The next step acknowledge the thoughts. It may feel like things were overwhelming right now, but how can I make most of the situation? How could I make it any better? Accepting the feelings, it’s okay to have a lot of feelings. Most people in crisis will go through angry, sad, disappointed, hurt, maybe even relieved feelings. It’s very important to experience them all, don’t want them with drugs or alcohol. Make a choice and what can I choose to do about the situation. Can I gather information? Can I bring some(ph), some solutions? What would my therapists say? What would my clergy men say? What would my parents say? What would my attorney say? What would I tell a best friend and he came to me in a similar situation. Don’t act on a crisis until you thought at least three or four or five options and for each one of them, think about the cost and time and energy and money and what the likely outcome would be? 

00:29:40
Coping With Crises; The Good… The Bad… The Ugly! 

00:29:40
MARK ZETIN Coping with crises, the good, the bad, the ugly. Healthy coping involves seeing the crisis as temporary. It’s a growth opportunity. It’s a challenge. Family and friends are resources. I’m strong and resilient. I can think of different ways to handle the situation. I can think about how practical, how likely the outcome would be. Poor coping(ph), I’ve once been told by a patient, there is no problem that alcohol cannot worsen. I think he's right, same goes for speed, cocaine, heroin, binge eating, suicide threats, these can all worsen the situation. 

00:30:25
Effective Coping 

00:30:30
MARK ZETIN Effective coping Caplin(ph) talks about effective coping is involving information seeking, expressing both positive and negative emotions and tolerating the frustration, those emotions won't go very quickly. Invoking help from others, breaking down the problem into manageable bits working on one at a time, pacing oneself to allow for the fact that it’s not gonna be all taken care of in one day, there has to be serious enough steps with some rest in between, maintaining control in the non-crisis areas is important, mastering feelings and accepting feelings, being willing to change and trusting yourself, trusting others, maintaining optimism are parts of getting through a crisis. 

00:31:20
Medications 

00:31:20
MARK ZETIN Medications can be a part of getting through a crisis too. I am a psychotherapist and a psychopharmacologist, I write prescriptions. Medications can help people to cope with moved anxiety, fears, hallucinations, can help with focusing attention, but every medicine has side effects. Most of those are dose-dependent, often decreasing a dose instead of stopping the medicine is an option, taking more than medicine, more than one medication is not unusual. Persons taking multiple medicines will often benefit from starting only one thing at a time. That way it’s possible to allow a few weeks to decide if the medicine is really giving some benefit that outweighs the side effects. If you're taking multiple medicines, the most recently added one is one that’s most likely responsible for side effects. The most recently discontinued one is the one that’s most likely responsible for any withdrawal symptoms or return of any initial symptoms. It’s human nature to run out of medicines to suddenly stop on a weekend or on a vocation or when the doctor’s gone because you run out of medicine and the question do I still need it. But it’s always much wiser to stop one thing at a time to taper gradually and to discuss with your doctor what symptoms might recur or what withdrawal symptoms might happen when going off a medicine. 

00:33:00
Approach To Crisis By Roberts 

00:33:00
MARK ZETIN And approach to crisis intervention that was described by Roberts involves several steps. First looking at the big picture the psychosocial situation at the risk of any danger to sell for others. Safety is the first concern. The second, establishing a good collaboratively relationship, so therapist and client can work together on problem solving. Identifying the problem, the crisis what led up to it is important, dealing with feelings and emotions is, so it’s generating an exploring different alternatives. Next implementing an action plan and finally having a follow-up plan or all part of getting through a crisis. 

00:33:50
Examples Of Crises 

00:33:50
MARK ZETIN Look you have a few examples of crises that we've seen that occur often. One crisis, my psychiatric symptoms are coming back. I've been treated for hallucinations, depressions, mania, panic attack, eating disorder and no longer am I taking the medicine or seeing the therapist. Symptoms have come back. What do I need to do? First, think about was there any trigger for the recurrence. Any substance abuse? Was it stopping medicines? Was it major life’s stress? What caused things to come back? And acting on that, calling the psychotrist or his covering physician, resuming medicines may make a difference. 

00:34:40
Financial Crisis 

00:34:40
MARK ZETIN Another very common crisis in these economic times is financial crisis. A sudden expense, unavoidable, unexpectable. The car broke down, the water heater sprang a leak, the roof started leaking, a tooth started hurting, what do I have to do about it? Well, first I have to acknowledge the meaning. Is it a very expensive inconvenient problem? Or does it mean I won’t be able to get to work, I won’t be able to pay my rent, I'll end up homeless? We have to look at what is the likely outcome and the potential outcome. Then we have to think about an action plan. Can I get a second opinion on what the repair will cost? Maybe a third opinion. Does repair person offer payment plan? Is there a less expensive temporary way to deal with the problem? How can I pay for it? Credit card? A loan? Bordering services? Borrowing from a friend or relative? sing public transportation? Living with someone else? What are my coping options? 

00:35:45
Lonliness Crisis 

00:35:50
MARK ZETIN A loneliness crisis. The therapist is gone, there is no one to talk to. All I do is work, come home, watch tv and go to sleep. What does it mean? Am I unworthy of having friends? Unlovable? No one cares about me? Or does it mean my life is out of balance? Too much emphasis on work, not enough on social life and friends? What can I do? Call the friends. Look at things I enjoy doing, look at meetup.com to find other people who share those interests. Joining a… a group for an activity. All sorts of options, but I have to take action. 

00:36:35
Plan Of Action 

00:36:35
MARK ZETIN Is there a support group that was helpful in the past? AA, OA, wake watchers(ph), bible study, may be I should go back? Are there some solo projects that are really interesting I really wanna do them and art, graft, writing, home improvement. Is it time to do it? Maybe appreciate the time of them. Time alone is after all time to do what I really want to do what’s satisfying, enjoyable. How much people contact do I really want and need anyhow? It’s highly variable from one person to another. For one person, every moment should in… involve people contact, closeness, connection, affection. For another person, there is too much of that of work, quite time he's treasured. What can I do to expand the social network if that’s what I choose to do? How can I just structure my life so there are some regular activities? 

00:37:35
Abandonment Crisis 

00:37:40
MARK ZETIN Another type of crisis is abandonment. The sense, my boyfriend or girlfriend hasn’t called me for a week. We had a fight. Is the relationship going to continue or is it gonna be over? My best friend has moved away. What’s the meaning? It might be over interpretive. I'll never have another boyfriend or girlfriend. I'll never have another best friend like the one who is moving. I'll be saddened only forever. Or it could mean I have time and energy freed up. I'll develop new friends, I'll be maybe a little more selective that way and get involved with. So what could be the action plans? I can minimize the impact of the person being away by keeping in contact, text messaging, e-mail, the phone, but I better not be demanding clingy, needy because that could bring a negative reaction. I could broaden the relationship network by going to a new class or activity or volunteer. I could recognize how important it is to be my own best friend, get comfortable being alone, doing nice things for myself and enjoy that. 

00:38:55
Relationship Crisis 

00:39:00
MARK ZETIN Relationship ending can be a huge crisis also. Sometimes the husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend says it’s over. What is the thought? What is the meaning? I can’t live without him or her. It’s a natural response. Do I depend on him or her for a vali… validation of my value as a person? Do I depend on him or her for affection, sex, place to live, money, support? What would be missing if they are not in my life? How can I get those needs met? Who are the family, friends, church? What are the resources to help me? Do I need an attorney for a spouse or child support? Is this really the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with? What have I learned from this relationship? What was really good about it? What did I love and care about and cherish most? Were there red flags warning me that there were problems ahead? Emotional abuse, physical abuse, alcohol abuse, what were there warnings? Do I need to choose differently next time? What’s the action plan? Is it time to spend more time with friends, family, at the church, at the gym, go to divorce recovery group. There are a lot of choices. When is the time to start dating again? How can I choose carefully? 

00:40:30
Job Criticism 

00:40:30
MARK ZETIN Job criticism, another kind of crisis many people deal with. I have met many people who say I have been doing my job well. I have been a superstar, I have been a top performer, but now I have a new manager and that young kid wants to tell me how to do things, how to prioritize things, how to do all the paperwork and all the things I'm doing wrong. That young kid is fresh out of school, doesn’t know anything about our business. I've been doing it for 20 years, I've been a high performer and now all I get is criticism. I have some choices. Is this the time to polish my résumé? Look at all of the new skills and knowledge I've acquired over this last 20 years and start looking for a new job. Would I be better off more appreciated somewhere else? Or is perhaps a little bit of that criticism valid and I could make improvements in some areas? Maybe I need to take it less personally. The new manager wants to make a change, even it’s not a change for the better, he is making some mark n the company and he feels like he has to do that. I shouldn’t over personalize it. Maybe it’s becoming harassment and I need to talk to him and the resources or talk to an attorney. In any case I do have a lot of choices. 

00:42:05
Job Loss 

00:42:10
MARK ZETIN Job loss is an even bigger crisis. Sometimes the company has been acquired, merged, downsized, and there is no job left for me. Could it mean the golden handshake? I have a salary for a year, I can start my own business, I can go back to school, I can retire. Or does it mean too old? It takes a long time to find a job and I'll never make that much money again. So there are a lot of things to do in coping with this. 

00:42:45
What Are Your Options 

00:42:45
MARK ZETIN First talk to him and resources, find out about what the options are. Is there a retirement plan that I've been contributing to, then polish the résumé, look at all of the new knowledge skills, responsibilities, accomplishments that you've had over the last few years. Call the friends and acquaintances in the same area of work. Has any supplier, customer, competitor been hinting at recruiting you? Do they know of any openings? Can they give you some help? Take the time to do a self-inventory of all the past jobs. What did you really like about them? What was the best part? Where were your talents and skills? Can you imagine yourself being enthusiastic about getting up and going to work and doing this kind of job five days a week for the next 10 or 20 years? Would you like to be doing something else? What would it involve? What's the ideal job description? How can you find a recruiter who could help you find that ideal job? Maybe it’s time to retire. There will be something else to do. There will be a lot more fun, a lot more interesting even if it doesn’t pay us well. There might be enough money in the retirement plan to let you do that. Sometimes public assistance is the best option. Unemployment, disability, food stamps, non-profit shelters, there are a lot of options when you really need them. 

00:44:05
Unplanned Pregnancy 

00:44:10
MARK ZETIN Unplanned pregnancy, major crisis point for some women. There may be a sense of joy and excitement. I really wanted a child, it’s just a little sooner than I expected. But there is also the issue. Did I have sex without protection? Stop taking the pill? Did I think that getting pregnant is going to keep a relationship going that was starting to fall apart? Do I know for sure who the father is? Is my husband? Is my boyfriend? My friend? And very important is the father someone who is gonna be there and be supportive emotionally, financially and the time commitment to raise the child and am I ready to have another child emotionally, physically, financially? Will my folks help? What do I want to do? Would I consider an emotion? Does it fit with my religious moral values? Would I consider adoption? What if I make know the doctor, parents? If I have the baby and keep the baby, what will I do for child care, housing, paying the bills, having the time available to really raise that child? 

00:45:20
Pregnancy Loss 

00:45:20
MARK ZETIN Pregnancy loss can be a crisis. Was it pregnancy planned, wanted? Can I view the pregnancy loss as a medical fact and not a personal punishment? Is the relationship a source of support coping? Did we ever get a good medical explanation why this happened and what to do? When I can retry pregnancy? 

00:45:40
Disapproval 

00:45:45
MARK ZETIN Disapproval from somebody who really matters. What if my parents are upset that I'm dating someone from a different religion, culture, race, educational level, social economic level? What if my parents are upset with my career decision? What if they are upset that I'm leaving school to have a baby or get married? They disapprove they are saying selling myself short. 

00:46:10
What Do They Really Mean 

00:46:10
MARK ZETIN Do they really mean I'm not living my life the way they expected me to live it. Whose life is it anyway? Am I willing to sacrifice my happiness for my parents? What would they really want me to do? How can I express gratitude for all the help, guidance they’ve given me up to now? Keep the relationship going, let them know I've heard their concerns, I understand them but really be assertive in telling them I have to follow my own path in life and make my own decisions. If I am right, hopefully they'll come around and accept my decision. If I'm wrong, I can hope that they'll help me pick… pick the pieces and move on. 

00:46:55
Academic Failure 

00:46:55
MARK ZETIN I failed a class at school. I just failed a chemistry exam. I just failed my math test. What does it mean? Is it lack of talent? Or is it lack of trying? To have the interest and aptitude and motivation to be science major? Was I slacking off partying, not studying, having a great time as a freshman in the dorms away from home, experimenting playing? Or is it that the classes are really difficult for me and I should rethink my major? Sometimes people do bunk a class, go undergraduate and be successful. So I need to make a decision. Do I need to stop partying and really focus on my school work? Or do I need to change directions and do something that comes naturally that follows my own talent? I could keep going and retake the class. My own personal example, I'd like to tell people. Anatomy was the best class in medical school. When I took it the second time I learned humility. When I graduated and became a full professor at the university where I failed anatomy, I learned that it was okay to fail and keep going. 

00:48:20
Serious Medical Illness 

00:48:20
MARK ZETIN Serious medical illness in self or others can be very tough to handle. The disability, pain, suffering, can be part of life. We all want to avoid them, but sometimes we can’t. When medical illness happens, we have to ask is this the doctor I want to trust with my life, my well-being? Does he have the expertise, the compassion, the caring to do a good job? Is he open to a second opinion? Do I want to go to a super specialty tertiary care university hospital? What’s the best treatment for what I've got? How can I learn as much as possible about the illness and its treatment? There are books. There are websites. There are support groups. How can I gather all the information to make the best decisions about my health care or that of my loved one? 

00:49:05
Death 

00:49:10
MARK ZETIN The death of someone close can be another crisis. If they were elderly, chronically ill, death was expected. It’s easier to say life was full, they were ready. But if they were young, vigorous, healthy, it’s harder to take. It forces me to think how temporary, fragile, uncertain life is. In either case, the process of grieving will go at a rate that no one else can determine. There is no right way. There is no formula for handling it. 

00:49:40
Grieving 

00:49:45
MARK ZETIN Grieving is part of life. It’s inevitable. It’s the sign that we’ve loved others. We’ve been attached to others. We’ve been close to them. And during grieving we have to face denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance that’s all parts of the dying process. We have to accept the reality that the other person isn't there anymore. It’s irreversible. It’s painful. We have to adjust to life without that person and we have to withdraw our energy from that relationship and invest it into others. Dr. Coopler Ross(ph) has talked about the stages of facing death and dying. They involve denial, anger, bargaining, depression, finally acceptance and they don’t occur in a nice clear linear order. (inaudible ) has talked about the tasks of grieving, accepting the reality, the irreversibility, the loss, the pain, adjusting to the environment and adjusting to life without the person who has died and then withdrawing emotional energy from the person who has died and putting that energy into a new relationship. Every culture, religion, every group has its own sense of community and values and its sense of how to deal with grieving. Remembering the good times, remembering the bad times, it’s all part of grieving, looking at the pictures, telling the stories, sharing the memories with others, all part of healthy normal grieving. 

00:51:20
Addiction 

00:51:25
MARK ZETIN Another type of crisis is the sense I just can't control my alcohol or drug use. Addiction is a disease of denial. The person who is addicted to alcoholic drugs doesn’t deal with that and acknowledge it until they hit bottom. It can mean different things for different people. Sometimes it means losing a relationship, losing a job, smashing a car, getting fired, getting arrested. When people hit bottom, they suddenly realize they're in crisis. An intoxicated person or a withdrawing person can’t be capable of good planning, decision making, behavior change. But a person who is sober is capable of these things. Detoxification can be done in a psychosocial residential center or it can be done in a hospital. Some people need 24-hour day supervision and support and medications to help them stop abusing alcoholic drugs. Other people can do it with daily 12-step meeting participation. If uncontrolled substance abuse is the key problem, the chances of controlled use of that substance are almost none. 

00:52:35
Abuse 

00:52:40
MARK ZETIN Abuse, victimization, being beaten up, robbed, raped, being put down emotionally by a partner, these can all be crises and the first step is to assure safety. There is no reason in the world to worry about the abuser or to try to protect him from the consequences of his behavior. The first step is safety if that means calling the police, calling child protective services, calling adult protective services, getting away from the abusive situation, the safety must be first. Medical treatment follows, taking care of any injuries. Psychologically the person who has been abused has usually faced social isolation, damaged self-esteem, a sense of accepting or even deserving abuse, financial dependence, emotional dependence, this is a bad bargain. This isn’t love. This is abuse. This should end. 

00:53:45
After The Crisis… 

00:53:45
MARK ZETIN After the crisis, what happens? All crises resolve usually within a few weeks. The emotionally intense, painful, sad, anxious, angry feelings, will dissipate with time. Usually the therapist will come back if there has been a breaking therapy. Life will normalize and the most important thing to ask yourself what have I learned from this whole experience. For the religious person, some would say God sends no problem that you can’t handle. For the non-religious person, some would say whatever crisis doesn’t kill you, promotes growth and strengthens you. Putting the crisis into a perspective and growing from it involves several steps. The first, let go of rumination. The need to replay the hurt, angry, blaming feelings, only gives the past too much power over the present. Look at the long-term perspective. What have I learned from this hard time from other hard times? What are my strengths? Who are my true friends? What are my best coping mechanisms? What worked for me? And what made things worse? How do I want my life to be different in the future? Did the crisis help me to clarify what’s really important, what I really want, what I really value in life? 

00:55:30
The Meaning Of The Crisis… 

00:55:30
MARK ZETIN The meaning of the crisis is something to look at. What are the changes that you can make to handle future crisis better? How do you work to cultivate human resources to nurture the relationships that can strengthen you, the friends, the family, the people who care, who can help you get through a crisis. Keeping some resources, money in the bank, very important to have some money as a coping resource, monitoring the status of relationships, asking for some feedback from your significant other, asking for some feedback from your boss at work, finding out if small problems can be corrected before they become big ones. Use therapy to carefully consider what you are doing with your life. Is it truly right for you, rewarding, satisfying your best path, taking advantage of your natural talents. If something isn’t working, can you deal with it directly and not ignore it and hope that it will go away? 

00:56:40
Advanced Directive 

00:56:45
MARK ZETIN Advanced directive is another concept. If you sometimes become disabled by serious psychiatric illness, by medical problems, by substance abuse, you might want to follow the recommendation of Copeland wellness recovery action plan. Writing down what are the symptoms that say I can’t take care of myself right now, I can’t be responsible, I want somebody else to take over my life for a little while. Maybe it’s the inability to handle everyday responsibilities to take care of everyday things, food, clothing, shelter, the feeling of being suicidal, severely depressed whatever it is, write it down and write down who should be notified and what you would like them to do to help you, who is your doctor, your psychiatrist, your therapist, what medicines have been helpful, what hospitals have been helpful, what rehab programs have been helpful and where would you rather not go in time of crisis. Maybe it’s worth writing this all down and getting the help of your attorney to prepare it in a legally binding document. 

00:57:55
Interviews 

00:58:00
MARK ZETIN Now Dr. Kanel will interview a woman who will talk to us about coping with cancer. 

00:58:05
MARK ZETIN Approximately almost exactly umm… 11 months ago, I went to Oaks ER because I was having headaches and it was Dr. Zetin’s suggestion that ah… if it’s unusual, if it’s worse, if it’s different, if… if… if it’s not a headache that you know the cause of, then you should go to the ER. Well, I did. It’s turned out that headache was absolutely nothing, but just coincidentally I had had lab… my annual lab work done to check my liver enzymes and everything. That report goes to Dr. Zetin. And when I was in Oaks ER, they did the tests over again and it was just like three weeks after I had had the first lab work done. And my liver enzymes had gone from normal three weeks before to five times out of range. I thought it was my gallbladder actually or that I had some sort of hepatitis or something. 

00:59:15
DR. KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:20
But within you know it’s… it’s good to… it’s good to have a husband who knows people who know people. Umm… I got put at the head of the line and UCI got an endoscopy within a week and a half and I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. And a week later, I was bumped to the head of the line for the top surgeon in hepatobiliary and pancreatic problems and he did a… it’s called the… what is the name of the, the whipple procedure… procedure? It is… thank you. One of the most… the whipple’s procedure is one of the most extensive surgeries that you can still have and look through. So, I’ve scar from here to here, plastic surgery isn’t the (inaudible ) things and some very-very lean. Umm… But this whole last year has been totally devoted to… the first six months were umm… chemotherapy after the… after I got out of the hospital. And in the meantime, I managed to get some sort of nerve pain disorders, so I’m also seeing umm… one of the… the head of the UCI pain center, because I’ve got nerve pain that is sort of like shingles. 

01:01:00
KRISTI KANEL So, you’ve got this nerve pain disorder… 

01:01:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:01:00
KRISTI KANEL …separate from the pancreatic cancer. 

01:01:05
Yes, but it’s… it’s caused from the surgery. 

01:01:05
KRISTI KANEL Umm… 

01:01:10
Because then nerves didn’t knit together prop… you know they don’t knit net together. 

01:01:10
KRISTI KANEL So, one of the little consequences of… 

01:01:15
Right. 

01:01:15
KRISTI KANEL …the treatment for the cancer. 

01:01:15
Yep. 

01:01:15
KRISTI KANEL Wow! 

01:01:15
And… 

01:01:15
KRISTI KANEL How are you feeling through all of this? 

01:01:20
Umm… I can’t… I can’t think about the whole thing. That’s what I realized right from the very beginning. 

01:01:30
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:01:30
That I have to… I have to live my life, not a day at a time… 

01:01:35
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:01:35
Like they talk about the 12-step programs. I’m living my life a minute at a time and I’m dealing with abso… I finally got… I was feeling guilty about the way the house is such a mess in the way this is such a mess and the way I wasn’t paying the bills so forth. Well, my life is totally focused right now on making it through the next minute. And that’s… that is all I can do. And I’m… and my life is totally involved with getting through this… the most… 

01:02:15
KRISTI KANEL Well, it sounds like your life is about being alive. 

01:02:15
Yes. 

01:02:15
KRISTI KANEL That’s… 

01:02:15
And… 

01:02:20
KRISTI KANEL …shown you what’s important is being alive. 

01:02:20
Yeah. The problem is that I’ve been really just dealing with trying to get over the negatives of this. 

01:02:30
KRISTI KANEL What are the negatives that you’re talking about? 

01:02:35
Well, umm… pancreatic cancer is the most deadly cancer. Uh… that sort of five-year survival rate is 30%. 

01:02:45
KRISTI KANEL And when did you hear that, the information? 

01:02:50
That… 

01:02:50
KRISTI KANEL How does that given to you? 

01:02:50
I’ve to tell you that everybody that you see I has been unbelievably compassionate caring and wonderful, except for this one women who marched into my ICU ward, I was still… I still had a nose tube in I think and said, Well, you know of course, that the survival rate for this cancer is 30%, five years. And then she marched out, I never saw her again. 

01:03:20
KRISTI KANEL And what were thoughts when you heard that? 

01:03:25
Well, I’m gonna be in the 30% well that was my first thought. And I still feel that way, even… even though a year later, just as I was about to start, I was… I had just gone through six months of chemo… 

01:03:40
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:03:40
And was just about to start radiation when they discovered that it had not spread, but it did come back in the same spot. 

01:03:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:03:50
That’s not surprising really, although my husband and I both sobbed when they told us that and my husband… 

01:03:55
KRISTI KANEL What did that mean to you when you heard that? 

01:04:00
I was stunned again. I don’t know that my brain… I think that… I think that I have an excellent denial syndrome. This is not gonna take me, I’m not ready. 

01:04:15
KRISTI KANEL Well, I was just curious, what plans do you have from hereon out to continue to cope with it so well and adapt to new things as they arise for you? 

01:04:25
I’ve got too much to do. The problem is I haven’t done any of it in the past year. All I’ve done is… is really be sick from one thing or another… 

01:04:40
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:04:40
…like I got out of the… the hospital umm… had really bad. They kept asking me in the hospital, if I was umm… nauseous if I’ve been vomiting and kept saying, “No, why do you ask?” You know… 

01:04:55
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:04:55
I couldn’t figure out why they had asked me that. 

01:05:00
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:05:00
I got home and within two days, I was throwing up gastric juices constantly. 

01:05:05
KRISTI KANEL Hmm… 

01:05:05
For probably about two months. It was… it was ground(ph) all day. 

01:05:10
KRISTI KANEL And yet you… and yet you continue to persevere. 

01:05:10
I had to what else am I gonna do? 

01:05:15
KRISTI KANEL There’s something inside of you will. 

01:05:15
What the… I’m not, you know what am I gonna do not throw it up or… or umm… eventually. 

01:05:20
KRISTI KANEL But you maintain this positive attitude it sounds like… 

01:05:25
I’ve got to. 

01:05:25
KRISTI KANEL So, I was just curious what plans do you have from hereon out to continue to cope with it so well and adapt to new things as they arise for you? 

01:05:35
That’s exactly what I planned to do is have alterations when the road curves, I’m planning to curve with it. I’ve no idea what’s gonna happen the next minute. Nobody does really. 

01:05:50
KRISTI KANEL Exactly. 

01:05:50
It’s just that I have a little more, a lot more awareness of living in the minute because I’ve got to. 

01:06:00
MARK ZETIN We’d like to introduce Linda, who will be talking to us about how she and her family were dealing with her father’s chronic illness before he died. 

01:06:15
KRISTI KANEL Okay, Linda umm… I thought that we could talk a little bit about the situation when you found out about your father’s illness, and just see a little bit about what you went through and how you dealt with that? 

01:06:30
LINDA Umm… I basically, just found out about it and umm… he’s been sick off and on for the last, probably two years. My mom passed away three years ago and… 

01:06:40
KRISTI KANEL Hmm… 

01:06:40
LINDA He… he did well the first year, but then started umm… a kind of decline medically in the past couple of years, and then… 

01:06:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:06:50
LINDA …this past year has been very hard. 

01:06:55
KRISTI KANEL Well, how did you find out about uh… did a particular serious illness start to happen just recently? 

01:07:00
LINDA Well, he kept having these falls and umm… would… you know break his hip and umm… have that taken care of, and then go through rehab, and then he would fall again and… and then umm… he started to have these little TIAs. 

01:07:20
KRISTI KANEL Can you describe what it’s like for you emotionally to have your father wanna like don’t put every effort towards it and you really wanting to, what’s that feel like? 

01:07:25
LINDA A very sad. 

01:07:25
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:07:25
LINDA Umm… he’s 80 and he’s lived a really good life. 

01:07:35
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:07:35
LINDA Umm… my brother and sister are very supportive, but they also are coming to the point where it’s time to let go. And I’m just so fighting that. 

01:07:45
KRISTI KANEL We always think about the person dying, you know we feel so bad for them, but it’s the ones that are left that we’re attached to this person that really have to bear a lot of that grief and… 

01:08:00
LINDA Yes. 

01:08:00
KRISTI KANEL So you, in other words it’s… it’s important to take care of yourself, and proactively talk about it and deal with it. And it is that, you know its grief. It’s loss and like you’re kind of fighting accepting that that isn’t an inevitable thing. 

01:08:15
LINDA And I know that the next time that I get a call and that’s why I have my phone, because I keep getting the calls from the nursing home. I have to make a decision whether to have him go to the hospital again for another work up that may not be good for him and he may not want versus having them do nothing in… in which case then they would probably sent him to the hospice floor. 

01:08:40
KRISTI KANEL You’d mentioned that hospice floor again, there’s something that it really means to you about moving him to hospice? 

01:08:45
LINDA My mom died there. 

01:08:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… In the same place? 

01:08:50
LINDA Yes. In the same place. 

01:08:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… And that’s still brings up tears for you. 

01:08:55
LINDA Yes. Umm… Like I said, they were, there you know wonderful resort kind of place uh… like care where they had their independent living, their assisted living, there’s still nursing facility and then the hospice floor is on the top of the skilled nursing facility building. And umm… my mom had Metastatic cancer as well, breast cancer and… 

01:09:20
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:09:20
LINDA …went from the independent living in the… the apartment straight to the hospice floor and I stayed with her 24/7 and was with her when she passed away and umm… I felt like… 

01:09:35
KRISTI KANEL And it almost seems like… 

01:09:35
LINDA I needed to do a lot more for her and I feel like I didn’t, but then intellectually I know that there wasn’t anything I could really do. 

01:09:45
KRISTI KANEL So, you were really attached to both your mother and father and… 

01:09:50
LINDA I… Yes. And I’m actually closer to my father… 

01:09:50
KRISTI KANEL Uh…Huh… 

01:09:50
LINDA And umm… The other thing for me is that with my mom then staff did a very good job. You know, with my mom with the family but I saw her receive more and more of the medication um, to put her out of her pain… 

01:10:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:10:20
LINDA …and to help her anxiety and saw her basically become more and more sedated and less and less aware and with my background I’m very much um… proactive and… 

01:10:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:10:35
LINDA …you know, I want the person to be able to you know, function and get better and have a background in acute rehabilitation, physical medicine rehabilitation and saying just keep cheering the person on and um… 

01:10:50
KRISTI KANEL Well you want them to be lucid to continue a relationship with you? 

01:10:55
LINDA Right. 

01:10:55
KRISTI KANEL And when that relationship is no longer normal you know, the communication and the feelings between you because of medication boy that… that’s… that’s really difficult to content with, isn’t it? 

01:11:05
LINDA That was probably the hardest part of it… 

01:11:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:11:05
LINDA And I… I can’t imagine going through that again with my father. 

01:11:15
KRISTI KANEL How did it manage it with your mother? 

01:11:20
LINDA I… I had a lot of family around during the time. 

01:11:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:11:20
LINDA Ummm… 

01:11:20
KRISTI KANEL You still have that family around you now? 

01:11:25
LINDA I… I do. I had my dad of course then… 

01:11:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:11:25
LINDA …and I feel like I had to be strong for him than too… 

01:11:30
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:11:30
LINDA Um, basically it was hard on him. What I did that worked for me and nobody else wanted to do is I stayed with her. I… I… you know, there was an extra bed in the room and I just, I slept there, I stayed with her, I, I talked with the doctors, I tried to educate myself, I tried to find out what was going on. Um… what medications there were given… giving her probably a bit over involved but it helped me. 

01:11:55
KRISTI KANEL It did help you? 

01:11:55
LINDA It did. 

01:12:00
KRISTI KANEL So is any of that possible to do now with your father? 

01:12:00
LINDA It’s harder because um… he has had so many problems. My mom just had one single problem that ah… lasted for several weeks. My dad has had several problems over a period of… 

01:12:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:12:20
LINDA …long period of time. 

01:12:20
KRISTI KANEL Do you see you could do now that would help you manage just a little bit through this. 

01:12:25
LINDA Talking about it is really important. 

01:12:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:12:30
LINDA Because… 

01:12:30
KRISTI KANEL To any body in particular? 

01:12:30
LINDA Talking with you, talking with my husband, talking with my friends. 

01:12:40
KRISTI KANEL Have you talked to your father about it? 

01:12:40
LINDA I haven’t yet talked to him about this. Um… I need to… 

01:12:45
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:12:50
LINDA …and I think you know, part of me again wants to spare him. May be it’s to spare me, because I’m afraid he is gonna say you know just um… let me go. 

01:13:05
KRISTI KANEL I’m sensing that would mean you have to come a little bit out of denial and move towards grieving? 

01:13:10
LINDA I think um, talking with my siblings… 

01:13:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:13:15
LINDA Um… I know they will be supportive of… of me having that kind of conversation… 

01:13:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:13:20
LINDA …with my dad um… making arrangements to go out there… 

01:13:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… uh…huh… 

01:13:25
LINDA …and um… you know just talking the time off from work and um, spending whatever time I can with him… 

01:13:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:13:40
LINDA …and just open up a conversation to ask him how he is feeling. I suppose I… 

01:13:45
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:13:45
LINDA I need to know how he is feeling about all of this too. 

01:13:45
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:13:45
LINDA That would be important. 

01:13:50
KRISTI KANEL So is there any thing else you could think of that can help people, because you’ve been through with your mother, through your father, now… what is some… what would you say as the biggest thing you think that’s the most helpful and in kinda dealing with these situations? 

01:14:10
LINDA For me? 

01:14:10
KRISTI KANEL Yes. 

01:14:10
LINDA What I’ve learned from this ah… is to education. 

01:14:20
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:14:20
LINDA To… to read about the disease the medical problem… 

01:14:25
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:14:25
LINDA Ah… talk with the doctors, find out what the prognosis is and the… the realistic expectations, um… I have to… to make sure in terms of talking care of myself. I have to make sure I eat… 

01:14:45
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:14:45
LINDA I have to make sure I exercise. I have to um… you know spend time with my husband. 

01:14:55
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:14:55
LINDA And I… and I spend time with my cat too… 

01:14:55
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… hmm…hmm… 

01:15:00
LINDA My cat gives me a lot of nurturing. Ha…ha…ha… 

01:15:05
MARK ZETIN We'd like to introduce you to Daniella. She will talk about how she experienced learning about her mother’s severe illness and dealing with her mother’s death. Thank you very much for coming in to talk to us today. 

01:15:15
DANIELLA Welcome. 

01:15:20
MARK ZETIN I understand you’ve had a major loss in your life and what we would like to do is understand how people cope with this kind of thing. So what I’m gonna ask you to do in your own words to tell your own story, how did you learn that things were very serious. How did you find out that they are going down and how did you handle it? 

01:15:45
DANIELLA Well, it was very unexpected I had just gotten home from a vacation this summer in… in August and um, spoke to my mom while I was on my holidays. Things seem to be going okay. She was you know, relatively healthy. Little bit of congestive heart failure her first time, but she was recovering um, really… really… really well. And um… in the days that I arrive back home within three four days she was um… starting to retain fluid and… and feeling very heavy chested and we got her to the hospital based on just almost over night like emergency and within the couple of… first couple of days in the hospital things seem to be going very… very positively. She was responding to the medicine, which when things go positively you know, even though you are in under a lot stress you start feeling that it’s gonna be okay… it’s gonna be okay. So that gives you a lot of positive energy. Just to you know, she was in San Diego so I was making the drive to San Diego from Orange County. You know… every day every night it was just but that gave me a lot of hope and energy and literally on the day that she was supposed to be released um… she collapsed and they brought her into the ICU and within you know, eight hours she was… she was… she was gone. So I think that part of the things I have to deal with was all of the hope that I was you know, that I was experiencing that was giving me all this positive energy to get through it and then to go through the shock of things happened so… so quickly and I was not being prepared um, was… it was really devastating. 

01:17:15
MARK ZETIN What were your first thoughts and feelings when you heard? 

01:17:20
DANIELLA Disbelief… um, I was sitting on my balcony here in Orange County getting ready to drive down to pick her up to take her home. 

01:17:30
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:17:30
DANIELLA And when my brother called and said she… she collapsed and they are bringing her into the ICU. You have to get here right now. I didn’t even tell my husband. I got in the car and I drove. 

01:17:40
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:17:40
DANIELLA And my brother had to call back, call the house and tell my husband you… you have to follow her. 

01:17:45
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:17:45
DANIELLA I mean it was almost a shock. It was shock in disbelief. 

01:17:45
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:17:45
DANIELLA Um… which you know no body should be driving in that state. 

01:17:50
MARK ZETIN Right. 

01:17:50
DANIELLA Um… and it’s almost a miracle that I made it there safely. 

01:17:55
MARK ZETIN What followed the shock in disbelief? 

01:18:00
DANIELLA Just simple despair. 

01:18:00
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:18:00
DANIELLA I felt I… I felt um, helpless. I went by the time, I arrived they had intubated her and um, she they… they put in the temporary pacemaker and… and we there we at that point we can no longer communicate… 

01:18:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:18:15
DANIELLA And I felt that you know that… you want it so badly hear what she has to say or hear her wishes and I felt helpless and… and um… shocked and then dis… dis… disbelief. 

01:18:25
MARK ZETIN And she died very shortly after that, did she? 

01:18:30
DANIELLA Ah… she died three hours after I got there and it was some kinda sad, because we’d had little family meeting with the doctor and um… the doctor kind of prepared us and said we will… we are going to attempt to put in a, a permanent pacemaker in a… in a couple of hours… 

01:18:50
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:18:50
DANIELLA …so why doesn’t every body take a break and get a bite to eat and… and… and come back. 

01:18:55
MARK ZETIN So again there is some a moment of hope… 

01:18:55
DANIELLA Another yes, a definite moment of hope when I… 

01:18:55
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:18:55
DANIELLA When I arrived there so… 

01:19:00
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:19:00
DANIELLA So first believe him, my brother and my husband drive me downstairs to get a cup of coffee and sandwich and my brother went home, because he had been there since 7 o’clock in the morning and I was sitting there marking and I… I literally felt that a shock go through me as I was trying to drink this cup of coffee… 

01:19:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:19:15
DANIELLA …and her voice is so loud in my head… 

01:19:20
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:19:20
DANIELLA …that I dropped everything started running upstairs and my husband said wait a minute you have to finish your coffee, you have to… 

01:19:25
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:19:25
DANIELLA …you have to eat something, you know. 

01:19:25
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:19:25
DANIELLA And I got little bit angry and I ran upstairs actually took the stairs… 

01:19:30
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:19:30
DANIELLA Then I didn’t want to wait for the elevator and when I arrived the doctor was waiting for me outside of her room and saying were telling me that they were loosing her. 

01:19:40
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:19:40
DANIELLA So I… I… I felt it I don’t know the thing that happens that your… your intuition might kick in… 

01:19:45
MARK ZETIN Sure. 

01:19:45
DANIELLA You… you feel it. Um, and at that point I actually passed out on the floor. 

01:19:50
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:19:50
DANIELLA Umm… 

01:19:50
MARK ZETIN That overwhelming? 

01:19:50
DANIELLA It was that overwhelming I… Yeah and then they had give me some salts and that took may be a couple of minutes and then I went into the room and um… I was able to say um… I was able to say few things to her that I really wanted to say… 

01:20:05
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:20:05
DANIELLA Hoping that she’ll hear me, but I wasn’t sure. 

01:20:05
MARK ZETIN Sure. 

01:20:05
DANIELLA I think for the first um, 15 minutes, 30 minutes I was in disbelief. I was just hugging her and then I wouldn’t let go and then the doctor called my brother told him to come back. So by the time I got my (inaudible ) about me everybody had come back. 

01:20:26
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:20:26
DANIELLA Um, but I think the fact that I was in the room just her and I… 

01:20:30
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:20:30
DANIELLA Um… and… and… and having to make the decision between you know, extreme life support measures and just letting her go peacefully… 

01:20:40
MARK ZETIN Hmm… 

01:20:40
DANIELLA …um and with the doctors um opinion was just to let her go peacefully. 

01:20:45
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:20:45
DANIELLA Because at that point there, there might have been some brain damage or you know a coma or you know that and to make that decision and… and to be forced to make it, I know that kind of pressure was… was I think I was in shock at first. 

01:21:00
MARK ZETIN Were you all by yourself at that point or was your husband? 

01:21:05
DANIELLA My husband was… was in the… he was in the room also but he was kinda and then giving me my space. I didn’t allow myself to grieve. I just jump right back into my life and took over and… and took over for her… 

01:21:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:21:15
DANIELLA But with her loss I had a couple of days where I couldn’t find my purpose. 

01:21:20
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:21:20
DANIELLA You know, and… and I, I run a business, so I’m an executive in a company. I, I married, I, I don’t have children but I… I have nieces and nephews and great friends and family and those are all purposes… 

01:21:35
MARK ZETIN Sure. 

01:21:35
DANIELLA But I think in the beginning my purpose had just been my parents. 

01:21:40
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:21:40
DANIELLA And so I was struggling to find my purpose at first. 

01:21:45
MARK ZETIN You have to kind of regroup and figure out what, what am I living for? 

01:21:45
DANIELLA Right what's… what's the purpose of my life and it had been my mom for three years since my dad passed away. It had been her. 

01:21:55
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:21:55
DANIELLA And it was almost a redefinition of myself. It was you know what oh, okay what's left… 

01:22:00
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:22:00
DANIELLA And and what's important to me now and… and how… how do I get through it and one of the things that I’ve found that I do well in my… in… in my businesses compartmentalize things and… 

01:22:10
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:22:10
DANIELLA And you know so I took a week off of work this is after the funeral, I… I took a week off from work to just kind of re… regroup with myself and re-compartmentalize what my priorities were and… and… 

01:22:25
MARK ZETIN Did you change your prioritize a lot at that point. Did you realize anything new about yourself? 

01:22:30
DANIELLA I learned a lot about myself. 

01:22:35
MARK ZETIN What was that? 

01:22:35
DANIELLA I learned that I was pretty much last on my own list and I put parents first and their health and their needs and my business and my husband and by the end of that day there is may be an hour left for yourself. 

01:22:50
MARK ZETIN Okay. 

01:22:50
DANIELLA And… and you know even though my mom lived in San Diego um, we spoke multiple times a day and because she didn’t speak English and you know there was a lot of things I took her to her appointments. I spent a huge part of my life… 

01:23:00
MARK ZETIN Right. 

01:23:00
DANIELLA …fully focused on her and when I had to regroup and re-compartmentalize myself I realized how much time that was and I wouldn’t do anything differently today, because I would do the same thing again… 

01:23:15
MARK ZETIN Right. 

01:23:15
DANIELLA …but all of a sudden I was faced with time. 

01:23:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:23:15
DANIELLA And… and in the mornings we’d have our coffee together. You know I sit in my balcony, her in hers and we talk and you know in Italian and we have our… 

01:23:25
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:23:25
DANIELLA …our lovely morning together before I went to work you know I sat there and I was quite and phone wasn’t ringing and… and I think there is so many realizations that are just devastating but also you have to re… I sort of reaching out to my friends and saying okay. Anne you are calling me at 7.30… sure she would calling me tomorrow… 

01:23:40
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:23:40
DANIELLA I was just trying to fill that… 

01:23:45
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:23:45
DANIELLA …space and not… not that I was trying to fill her space but… 

01:23:45
MARK ZETIN Right. 

01:23:45
DANIELLA …trying to give myself a little bit of a routine so that I could think straight. 

01:23:55
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… So having that contact with your friends helped you to think straight, get a routine going… 

01:24:00
DANIELLA Right. 

01:24:00
MARK ZETIN What did you learn about making yourself a higher priority? 

01:24:00
DANIELLA I think when… when people are in the care giving process you know, with the elderly parents and… and that they are care giving or their business owners or what ever they are, they dedicate so much of themselves to other things and… and… 

01:24:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:24:15
DANIELLA The most important thing that I learned is that it’s really important to put not yourself first in a selfish way but put yourself first as a priority… 

01:24:20
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:24:20
DANIELLA And… and that was really hard for me I’m still working on that and it has been four months… 

01:24:25
MARK ZETIN Okay. 

01:24:25
DANIELLA And I’m still trying to… to put you know, put myself in a situation where I am equally as important as those other things. Sometimes I think when you… when you think in your journal(ph)… 

01:24:40
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:24:40
DANIELLA You tend to… I tend to make something much bigger than it really is, right… 

01:24:45
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:24:45
DANIELLA I just see when I’m journaling(ph) I can go pages and pages and pages of emotions and when you think by yourself especially in the middle of night if you can’t sleep things just get huge… 

01:24:55
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:24:55
DANIELLA And and our… and our little like that… out loud therapy that we do um… we say things out loud. 

01:25:00
MARK ZETIN Yes. 

01:25:00
DANIELLA So say the emotions out loud. So you are accountable for saying them. 

01:25:05
MARK ZETIN Yes. 

01:25:05
DANIELLA As well as somebody is hearing you. 

01:25:05
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:25:05
DANIELLA You know without.. without judgment. So we’re not judging each other and… and I am able to say my emotions and I give myself 30 minutes a day you know… 

01:25:15
MARK ZETIN Yes. 

01:25:15
DANIELLA In the morning to just say my feelings whether it’s to my husband or to a friend or to my brother or you know a co-worker um… that I can just get it off my chest and then I really good at compartmentalizing. So I put that aside and then I think… 

01:25:30
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:25:30
DANIELLA Then I can do the next. 

01:25:30
MARK ZETIN Then you can go to work. 

01:25:30
DANIELLA Then I can go to work, alright. 

01:25:35
MARK ZETIN Okay, any things that you would say that was a mistake I really shouldn’t have done it. 

01:25:35
DANIELLA I’m a runner, so I run. 

01:25:40
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:25:40
DANIELLA And and um… I run everyday or you know five to six times a week and I started running twice a day, three times a day… 

01:25:50
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… yeah… 

01:25:50
DANIELLA Which is great if you’re, you know trying to turn down or something but that wasn’t the case and I… I really I’ve been I just depleted myself. 

01:25:55
MARK ZETIN How long did it take you to get through the acute grieving process? 

01:26:00
DANIELLA I’m not speaking about religious specifically as specific religion but just faith in general… 

01:26:05
MARK ZETIN Uh…huh… 

01:26:05
DANIELLA …in knowing that there is something beyond our life here. You know something that gives you hope that that person is in a better place. 

01:26:15
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:26:15
DANIELLA Hope that you will be connected with that person again. 

01:26:20
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:26:20
DANIELLA Um… and… and… and just to have faith and strength in faith… 

01:26:20
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:26:25
DANIELLA …was, was huge for me. Some of the books that I read have some coping mechanisms in their book, what I… what I learned is if you try to apply precisely what's written to you, it doesn’t apply. 

01:26:35
MARK ZETIN What part did your husband play? 

01:26:35
DANIELLA He was unbelievable and… and… and if I could say that I’m… I'm beyond thankful for his… for his support um… I think that’s really important if you have a loss and you have a partner that they understand what you are going through and I don’t think he could actually understand he has both, he still has both parents… 

01:26:50
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:26:55
DANIELLA …and you know that’s a wonderful thing and so I don’t think you know what it's like to you loose one of your parents or somebody… somebody you know close to you and what that feels like that just the fact that he is… he was there to listen to me and my out loud there be… 

01:27:10
MARK ZETIN Yes. 

01:27:10
DANIELLA And… and… and run with me and… and sooth me and just be a really great partner and be really supportive with my family and help me plan the funeral and just be a helper. Just a true member of the family that… that was… 

01:27:20
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:27:20
DANIELLA That was just fantastic. 

01:27:25
MARK ZETIN You said its four months. Is life back to normal yet? 

01:27:30
DANIELLA I don’t know. 

01:27:30
MARK ZETIN No… 

01:27:30
DANIELLA No its not, I don’t know that holiday seasons… you know was really, really difficult um… I think that I create new coping mechanisms for every event. 

01:27:40
MARK ZETIN Yes. 

01:27:40
DANIELLA The holidays needed new you know coping strategies. I took away all of my traditional Christmas things and did everything different this year. Just that so it’s not to repeat something and feel void. I think ploughing through and trying to make at the same… 

01:27:55
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:27:55
DANIELLA …wouldn’t have worked for me. 

01:28:00
MARK ZETIN So you want to avoid feeling that sense… 

01:28:00
DANIELLA Right. 

01:28:00
MARK ZETIN …she is not there. 

01:28:00
DANIELLA So instead of doing Christmas day at my brother’s home… 

01:28:05
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:28:05
DANIELLA …with the whole family traditionally the way that we’ve always done it. Um… my husband and I went on Christmas eve. 

01:28:10
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:28:10
DANIELLA And we did something completely different… 

01:28:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:28:15
DANIELLA And so it… it was equally sad but it… it just it was different. So I wasn’t trying to compare from last year or the year before you know, I was just trying to create something new… 

01:28:25
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:28:30
DANIELLA And, and that… that has helped me. 

01:28:30
MARK ZETIN So that’s been a creative strategy? 

01:28:30
DANIELLA Same for her birthday and same for Thanksgiving and same for everything else and I’m just trying to think off a different something to do different. 

01:28:40
MARK ZETIN And those holidays are typically tough times… 

01:28:40
DANIELLA I think they are tough… 

01:28:40
MARK ZETIN …there has been big loss. 

01:28:45
DANIELLA Yeah, I think that they are tough without loss because they… they counter(ph) so much emotion and expectation… 

01:28:45
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:28:50
DANIELLA Um… and then when you have the loss in there… 

01:28:50
MARK ZETIN Hmm…hmm… 

01:28:50
DANIELLA I think, it’s… it’s even harder. You know I've started recently just taking better care of myself. If you, if you imagine like a pie… 

01:29:00
MARK ZETIN Yes. 

01:29:00
DANIELLA …and then I try to envision each segment of my life is like a slice and I have my work size, and my life size and then my friends size and my responsibilities and I try to… to pass that and I try… trying to really focus on giving equal time to those things… 

01:29:15
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:29:15
DANIELLA …and the… the big… the big huge size that was my parents um… or most recently my… my mom um… I’m trying to, to be that size up into the other pieces just to give more time to the things that aren’t important. 

01:29:25
MARK ZETIN Sure. 

01:29:30
DANIELLA Most importantly what I found is that you have to be true to your emotions and, and not hide them and… and the fact that I’ve vocalize a lot of my emotions um… in 15 minutes, 20 minutes rather than you know cover myself in bed and lay there all day and cry. 

01:29:45
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:29:45
DANIELLA I found that to be and I’ve been around bereavement and I’ve seen all different responses to it and some… 

01:29:50
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:29:50
DANIELLA …people can go down so… so quickly… 

01:29:55
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:29:55
DANIELLA …because may be they feel that nobody is listening or they have so much to say that they just want to be heard and I… I think that that you know, vocalizing my feelings… 

01:30:05
MARK ZETIN Yeah. 

01:30:05
DANIELLA …really, really help me um… not want to you know, throw myself under the covers and… and… and you know hide all day. 

01:30:15
MARK ZETIN Good, so it sounds like you’ve found a very healthy adaptive path for you. 

01:30:20
DANIELLA I’m working on it. 

01:30:20
MARK ZETIN I’d like to introduce Steve he has had to deal with anger outbursts and a stormy relationship with a girlfriend whom he loves very much. 

01:30:30
STEVE I… you know I see Dr. Zetin and he helps me you know you deal with anger and you kinda learn about it and I think what she does is gets angry and then lashes out. 

01:30:40
KRISTI KANEL At you? 

01:30:40
STEVE Correct… correct the nurse… the nurse… So but I love her a lot, so it’s been a very… 

01:30:45
KRISTI KANEL What do you do when that anger comes at you? 

01:30:50
STEVE Try its been I mean internalizing quite a bit was been very, very hard. 

01:30:55
KRISTI KANEL So at the time when she is angry at you in expressing this, are you able to access that particular thought of hope and the reality behind it. 

01:31:05
STEVE You are asking me to think about at that moment kind of there is hope, yeah I can do that. You just have to figure out that the person really loves you. They are just angry. 

01:31:10
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:31:10
STEVE They are not trying to end there. You just put the person genuinely loves me and they are just pissed off. People get mad at you, family gets mad at me but they love me, you know. 

01:31:20
KRISTI KANEL But it sounds like she is not mad at you or did I miss something… 

01:31:25
STEVE No she is mad at something else but thinks a lot of me. 

01:31:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:31:25
STEVE So misplaced aggression or not to say in Spanish, but that’s what it is. Try to… try to figure out the words but I don't want to. 

01:31:30
KRISTI KANEL So at the time though can… can you think that? Can you trade your one thought that she is angry at me and say wait she is not really at me she is displacing this anger on to me. So… 

01:31:45
STEVE That doesn’t help. 

01:31:45
KRISTI KANEL But she is not angry at you then all those other things that go along with it like she might leave me. How those would really be connected anymore. 

01:31:50
STEVE It’s hard, it’s hard if you’ve been through it because… because you are in the middle of a storm… 

01:31:55
KRISTI KANEL I am not saying its not… its not hard, its hard… 

01:32:00
STEVE No, it’s a middle of a storm. You are trying to say that was this isn’t really involve me to involve something else, because the challenge that comes up is… is at real. Is this real? Is this ever am I the source of this problem or does this involve other issues other than me from Mexico stress that she is dealing with or am I the cause of it. Because you are… it’s not reality testing, it’s sort of it’s the test in all the time whether… whether my thoughts are valid you know like, my worries though that I cause it. 

01:32:20
KRISTI KANEL So are you saying that there are sometimes when you might be… 

01:32:25
STEVE Of course… 

01:32:25
KRISTI KANEL …at the cause of her anger. 

01:32:25
STEVE I am not the perfect… perfect therefore… 

01:32:30
KRISTI KANEL Oh okay, because that I hadn’t heard that before. 

01:32:30
STEVE Oh, I’m sorry of course… yeah… yeah… 

01:32:30
KRISTI KANEL So sometimes you might actually be part of that anger. 

01:32:35
STEVE Yeah, sure you know. 

01:32:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:32:35
STEVE It takes me a lot of time to park I don’t… I don’t move as quickly as I used to. She is 20 years younger and she moves quick and I’m slower. 

01:32:40
KRISTI KANEL Let’s say you are the… the root of her anger, okay. 

01:32:45
STEVE That could be right you never know. 

01:32:50
KRISTI KANEL Well, what when you are the… when you look at it realistic and then realize yeah I’ve done something to kind of piss her off. What have you done to help you get through that or what can you do… 

01:33:00
STEVE That’s a hard one. That’s a hard one, because it‘s like when it’s my depression or something about me that I’m impatient she was in a very(ph) battery at Long Beach. 

01:33:05
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:33:05
STEVE You know it’s just not safe to be there. That you see gangs, you look around Oh man this, my god! This is not safe. You know she gets pissed, because she could see that I’m not happy being there. She is a great girlfriend, but she just gets mad sometimes yeah. 

01:33:20
KRISTI KANEL And… and… 

01:33:20
STEVE Dedicated relationship… 

01:33:20
KRISTI KANEL And she is dedicated to her anger expressions. 

01:33:25
STEVE Yeah. 

01:33:25
KRISTI KANEL Like that’s something that she just does. 

01:33:25
STEVE It’s a habit… it’s a habit. 

01:33:25
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:33:25
STEVE It’s a habit she does just misplaces something else on, lashes on somewhere else. 

01:33:30
KRISTI KANEL Or she is angry at you but… 

01:33:30
STEVE Could be… could be. 

01:33:35
KRISTI KANEL …you know the situation of you’re not wanting to spend the night there blah… blah… blah… may be that’s still she is angry that she has to live there in that area. 

01:33:40
STEVE It could be she says no but she says she still likes it. 

01:33:45
KRISTI KANEL Oh… okay. 

01:33:45
STEVE I don’t see how. 

01:33:45
KRISTI KANEL So that what do we do as humans when somebody just doesn’t like our choices we either change our choices or we have to let them be angry with them. It’s kind of like when the… when the pain outweighs the gain. We… we have to make some change or something. 

01:34:05
STEVE Correct. 

01:34:05
KRISTI KANEL And yet she hasn’t left you. 

01:34:05
STEVE No… no… 

01:34:10
KRISTI KANEL And you said that was one of your ultimate thoughts or concerns. 

01:34:10
STEVE Yeah that’s are my, my concerns and I’m gonna quit. So just trying to understand what's going on and the cultural differences. The culture is easier to the deal within our own culture. I think it’s easier. It’s a very dedicate… in my opinion that it just really delicate to the relationship, but other issues come up. 

01:34:25
KRISTI KANEL Well also. 

01:34:25
STEVE Because usually guys that are very controlling and American guys are not that way, but in Mexico they are. And I’m just not so, she has probably had bad experiences. 

01:34:35
KRISTI KANEL And Latino women are very emotional. I mean, expressive… 

01:34:40
STEVE Oh yeah, yes. 

01:34:40
KRISTI KANEL In touch with emotions and… 

01:34:40
STEVE Umm… 

01:34:40
KRISTI KANEL You know that, that could be part of its cultural too… 

01:34:45
STEVE Yeah, it’s true I've learnt it… that was his expression you know… 

01:34:50
KRISTI KANEL And so at least I always look at this way at least she is expressing herself to you and you know where you stand at that moment. 

01:34:55
STEVE That’s true. That’s good point. So once you don’t know what they are saying right, what they are thinking, then they go on like that you never know what happen. It’s true… 

01:35:05
KRISTI KANEL But it just hard to take it at the moment. 

01:35:05
STEVE It’s very hard. 

01:35:05
KRISTI KANEL And have you tried any thing else. 

01:35:10
STEVE I can’t, so I’ve trouble self-processing it. My folks helped me, tremendously my brothers and sisters helped me. Family it’s like all the time. 

01:35:15
KRISTI KANEL It sounds like that’s better than processing it with (inaudible ). 

01:35:20
STEVE That’s very funny. Yeah, that doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. 

01:35:25
KRISTI KANEL It doesn’t work at all. 

01:35:25
STEVE No, it works in therapy when you talk about feelings, but doesn’t mean to talk about because I… I talk about feelings she doesn’t likes to talk about feelings than I used to do it. 

01:35:30
KRISTI KANEL Well One of the things I know when someone is angry it’s not probably a good time to try to process things with them. When they are not rational… 

01:35:40
STEVE Right. 

01:35:40
KRISTI KANEL That probably doesn’t work. 

01:35:40
STEVE No, even later if you bring it up it could be (inaudible ) though if you can bring up something from the past, you can (inaudible ) so people don’t like the processing, talk about issues that’s their style, you know. 

01:35:50
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:35:50
STEVE I like this but if you sometimes I can aggravate people in and off itself. 

01:35:55
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:35:55
STEVE To talk about as you’re saying I forget, let’s go. Let’s go to movie do something else. Drop it you know. 

01:36:00
KRISTI KANEL Are you saying that may be that gives you a sense of… if you surrender and say I can’t fix her, I cant stop this angry outburst on her part. So I’m gonna quit trying to… it is what it is… 

01:36:10
STEVE It is what it is. 

01:36:10
KRISTI KANEL …I will talk to other people… 

01:36:10
STEVE Right. 

01:36:15
KRISTI KANEL Not try to force her to talk about it. 

01:36:15
STEVE Correct but the trick in that is that not quit the relationship. 

01:36:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:36:20
STEVE Just to just except that part of the personality, because part of the part of the thing is just go off (inaudible ) I’m leaving and that’s… that’s what the challenge you know. 

01:36:30
MARK ZETIN We'd like to introduce you now to a young women who has had a very difficult and longstanding divorce dispute ongoing with a very abusive husband. She will talk to us a little bit about how she might separate from him and what she might need to do to make that happen. 

01:36:50
KRISTI KANEL Anything you want to talk about? 

01:36:55
Well, I’m going through a divorce. 

01:36:55
KRISTI KANEL Hmm… 

01:36:55
And um… 

01:37:00
KRISTI KANEL That the papers have been filed already, okay. 

01:37:00
Hmm…hmm… that he will not sign them. 

01:37:00
KRISTI KANEL Um… 

01:37:00
Because then he looses control over um… everything. 

01:37:05
KRISTI KANEL And how long ago did… did you give him those? 

01:37:10
Um… it’s last January. So it’s been almost a year. He has been married before… 

01:37:15
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:37:15
…and he knows how to work it and so he… what he makes on paper it’s like different from what makes on and he makes cash. He is lone chap(ph) basically. 

01:37:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:37:25
So he is retired and he gets a fixed income, but he has all this everything else on the side that it’s in other people’s names and um… he has put me in this lifestyle and my son in this lifestyle and he goes to private school and there been a private community and um… he knows how important that is and he threatens to take it away if I don’t do anything, and you know if I don’t follow the rules. 

01:37:50
KRISTI KANEL And the rules are don’t get divorced or… 

01:37:55
Yeah, just I can’t have a life. I can’t go out. I can’t do anything. And the problem is I was, he was convicted of domestic violence in 2004. 

01:38:05
KRISTI KANEL I can (inaudible ). 

01:38:07
Hmm…hmm… I went and I had a 3-year-old and I went and I didn’t tell, I didn’t tell anybody what was going on… 

01:38:10
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:38:15
And um… finally I started opening up to somebody and they said that’s not alright. It’s… it’s not okay. 

01:38:25
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:38:25
You know and they took it seriously and I went and saw the lawyer and I told the lawyer and so then the ball started you know rolling and I got restraining order… 

01:38:30
KRISTI KANEL And was he convicted of domestic violence. 

01:38:35
He was convicted. I had a… I had… I had a full custody of my son. I had a protective order, a completely protective order, he wasn’t allowed to phone me or anything… 

01:38:45
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…hmm… 

01:38:45
Um… 

01:38:45
KRISTI KANEL And in the state of California he cannot get custody of your child… 

01:38:50
No… 

01:38:50
KRISTI KANEL …because of that conviction. 

01:38:50
But um, I went the next day… 

01:38:50
KRISTI KANEL Uh…huh… 

01:38:50
And I filed papers with the court saying that I made a mistake and that um… I was coursed into it by my lawyers and everything and that I didn’t want to take it all back and so the judge signed off on it and he let him back in my house. 

01:39:10
KRISTI KANEL So that was the domestic violence charge. It was… 

01:39:10
It wasn’t dropped. 

01:39:10
KRISTI KANEL It wasn’t? 

01:39:10
But it was never enforced, because I dropped the restraining orders and he never went to anger management. He has ordered to do that. He didn’t go, nothing happened. 

01:39:20
KRISTI KANEL But there is a conviction. 

01:39:20
There was a conviction, but because I didn’t… I didn’t… because I let it go. 

01:39:25
KRISTI KANEL Are you safe now? 

01:39:30
I don’t know. I don’t know he has a transponder to where I live. He can drive by any moment and um… he is a sociopath. He is a… he is been diagnosed as sociopath. However, they don’t think he is like an OJ(ph) or anything they will think he is very dangerous but… 

01:39:50
KRISTI KANEL But he has hurt you. 

01:39:50
Oh yeah. And he has hurt my child. 

01:39:55
KRISTI KANEL And the department of Social Services knows he has hurt your child? 

01:39:55
Uh…huh… Well you know they don’t.. I mean he hasn’t like physically beat him or anything, but he's hurt him emotionally. If you read any book on domestic violence… 

01:40:05
KRISTI KANEL Sure. 

01:40:05
It’s… it’s… it's textbook. I met him, within a month I had quit my job and I was completely 100% depended on him and he started with the smacking and hitting and then came the verbal stuff… 

01:40:20
KRISTI KANEL Umm… 

01:40:20
…like just little things. And he forbid… I used to get anxiety because I was dependent on somebody. It was… Looking back it was a really normal anxiety; it was a normal fear. 

01:40:30
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:40:30
…and somebody who wasn’t umm… who is in our, just also who just really it’s all about him and playing golf and he wanted me to take care of his daughter and wanted me to clean out his deposits and I’m college educated and I speak four languages and I had a really good job and then it was really difficult. Legally I’m not supposed to making any money and he threatens that (inaudible ) custody and he doesn’t have a job and he knows it’s really the only thing I care about is having custody of my son. He says that his goal is… well, first he’ll brag like oh, I'll make you sell a lot of clothes and make you sell a lot of shoes and it makes me so happy and that makes me really happy that I'm gonna have to do that. I'm doing it because that represents a lot of happiness because that was a coping mechanism, shopping. 

01:41:15
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:41:15
A really big one. 

01:41:15
KRISTI KANEL And that’s not… that doesn’t work now for you? 

01:41:20
No. It just represents being unhappy and represents… 

01:41:20
KRISTI KANEL So you are selling some of your clothes? 

01:41:25
Umm… I'm selling everything. 

01:41:25
KRISTI KANEL And you’re feeling good about that? 

01:41:25
Yeah. It’s about $0.10 to the dollar, but it’s okay, at least it’s going away and just umm… but… and he also umm… knows I’m fragile. I am… I’m… I am done with him. 

01:41:40
KRISTI KANEL You are done with him, okay. 

01:41:40
He is not done. He… he… he… he sends me text messages and this is what he says and this is… you take care of me and I’ll take care of you. All I have is what he puts in my bank account. Everything else I have never had access to one bank account, I have never had access to anything for entire 10 years of being married, nothing. He has a PO box, everything is separate, I have never signed off anything. He forges my name on tax returns. He… he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care and you know the lord does not protect women. It does not. There is no protection. He can do whatever he wants. He signed off his life insurance policy after date of separation to somebody else. He took $500,000 out of my 401(k) without any settlement or anything and nothing is gonna happen. So I just… just learn to let go and that doesn’t really matter, but it’s… it’s hard because he then tries to get my son. You know he will take him to go you know my shoes or whatever he wants, computer, he bought him a computer for Christmas and I don’t have access to my… I think it’s… it’s… 

01:42:45
KRISTI KANEL Well, it's unfair. That’s the biggest problem. 

01:42:45
Unfair and the other thing is my cousin told me this as (inaudible ), it doesn’t exist. There is no fair. If you're looking for a fair, it’s just… it’s not fair. 

01:43:00
KRISTI KANEL And it’s not fair that he developed to have such a kind of a pathological personality structure. 

01:43:05
Oh, he is… he is. He lies… he lies about every single thing. I've gotten phone calls from women in the middle of the night, he's had complete relationships with forever like he needs a double life. 

01:43:15
KRISTI KANEL You know he could never have what you have, which is to have a real genuine heart… 

01:43:20
Yeah. 

01:43:20
KRISTI KANEL …and a genuine ability to have meaningful connections with people. 

01:43:25
No, he will never. 

01:43:25
KRISTI KANEL But you get that. 

01:43:25
Yeah, but umm… I don’t remember what it’s like. You know it’s weird, it's like… 

01:43:30
KRISTI KANEL But I feel it right now with you. 

01:43:35
Actually I just wrote something about that. It’s just… because I was thinking why did I go back to him after I had a full restraining order. 

01:43:40
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. 

01:43:40
I had enough support to live in my house. I mean I could I would have been vying and I… I really thought about it and I was thinking about some you know prisoners. They get out of the prison and they don’t know what to do with themselves. 

01:43:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:43:50
It’s like now what? Okay, well, they went and they got out and then they do the… they will go commit a crime to get back in and that’s what I did. I ran right back, because I know he wanted to, he said he's gonna buy me a car and umm… 

01:44:05
KRISTI KANEL But could we say that that wasn’t a good coping strategy to back with him? 

01:44:05
No, it’s horrible, it’s out of fear, it was out of fear and you know what it was… 

01:44:10
KRISTI KANEL Sure. 

01:44:10
…we’re(ph) out of fear it was because I really believed I was doing a right thing for my son. 

01:44:15
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:44:15
I really did. 

01:44:15
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. 

01:44:15
I told everybody anyone who would ask I said well, you know, it’s not about me anymore. I have a child. 

01:44:20
KRISTI KANEL What do you want to do? 

01:44:25
Umm… I wanna be free. I’ve never done drugs. I don’t drink. I don’t do… but I will… I will certainly go spend $2000 in a pair of shoes and to say, I mean it is not fair. 

01:44:35
KRISTI KANEL Does that help? 

01:44:35
I feel like I’ve earned it. That’s why… 

01:44:35
KRISTI KANEL Does that help you feel better? 

01:44:40
No. 

01:44:40
KRISTI KANEL What does? 

01:44:40
Writing's wonderful. 

01:44:40
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:44:45
Umm… That’s helped me a lot kind of… and… and in a writing group and that’s… 

01:44:45
KRISTI KANEL What do you write about? 

01:44:50
I write nonfiction. I write about all the stuff and I write about umm… how you cope that's the hard part. Umm… it’s a kind of day to day. I don’t have any long-term really. I am working with a company, a non-profit right now and they worked really hard and I worked for free for a couple of years and like okay we’ll… we'll hire you. He'll… he is threatening that he wants 50% custody. 

01:45:15
KRISTI KANEL I have seen this happen a lot and I have to tell you those 730 wallets(ph) are really quite important in situations like this because then you are getting professional people… 

01:45:25
Yeah. 

01:45:25
KRISTI KANEL …who can see through these problems and they do what’s best for the child. 

01:45:30
Hmm…Hmm… He wrote in his… he need to write the declaration and was(ph) emotionally and stable, which the only way I'm gonna be staying stable it’s because… because he’s driven like crazy but… umm… and he said, he… she will have a nervous breakdown. I’ll push her to the brink of having a nervous breakdown and she'll have to go to the hospital and then I'll get custody because everyone will… 

01:45:55
KRISTI KANEL So what are you gonna do to make sure that doesn’t happen? 

01:45:55
Oh, it's not gonna happen. 

01:46:00
KRISTI KANEL What are you gonna do? Let’s… let’s… let’s just express the best that we can do to make sure you don’t fall apart and then you strengthen yourself? 

01:46:10
Well, I’ve actually… I’ve actually umm… gone through a list of enough people that have… I… I had a… a crisis with my knee this year and that’s really what kind of bought everything to the… and you… you find out who your friends are, you find out who is there for you… 

01:46:25
KRISTI KANEL Sure. 

01:46:25
…who is not there for you. And umm… I deleted a lot of people out of my life because they really didn’t care. 

01:46:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:46:35
And so now I’m… I’m finding that has it become evol… involved in things that mattered to me like a non-profit. Umm… There… There are dear friends, wonderful women that are really caring and really like real people. Umm… that helps and that gets me self-esteem. 

01:46:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:46:50
Doing work I don’t care if it’s for free. He calls… he calls me a beggar, so you’re a beggar because I go and help raising money for the non-profit and you know people are using me and this and that. And it’s not so because the CEO writes me handwritten Christmas card and they know me by name and they invite me to board meetings and to do fabulous things and umm… I'm included and it makes me… that makes me feel good. 

01:47:15
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:47:15
And it gives me hope and I think a lot of it is having hope that umm… and umm… and for my son, I mean I can’t give… like he doesn’t need his mom the straight jacket, I mean that’s not gonna do him any good. 

01:47:30
KRISTI KANEL What’s something realistic you could do you think? 

01:47:30
Well, I need to stop spending money. 

01:47:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. So that’s under your control. 

01:47:35
Yeah. 

01:47:35
KRISTI KANEL So those are the kinds of realistic things. 

01:47:40
Yeah and I… and I’ve… I’ve… I've… have a little… I… I went actually to the bank and I opened a savings account… 

01:47:45
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:47:45
…that he has no ideas there and every check I get from a consignment store or anything else… 

01:47:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:47:50
…I put it in there. So a lot of things are standing out for myself and umm… a lot of… I've gotten advices to dis… disengage. 

01:48:00
KRISTI KANEL Okay. So after watching all of these sessions, I'd like to highlight some of the common themes that people have suggested in terms of coping with various crisis and umm… connect it with some of the theoretical positions that Dr. Zetin had talked in his previous section. Umm… one of the things that is really common throughout everybody is talking to people. And in Caplan's work in the beginning of crisis management, he really impressed the idea of invoking help and support from others is very important. And in doing so you're also expressing feelings, which he also found to be vital in getting through a crisis situation. And once you express those feelings, you’d… you learn how to master those feelings as well. And so I think those… that right there seems to be the crux of how people manage crisis. Another thing that we noticed was seeking information and getting facts and exploring the reality of the situation, which is another thing that Gerald Caplan in his work with Lindemann that they found to be effective coping behavior. Without reality and without facts, we’re… we operate on often on illogical and irrational and unrealistic views of the situation. So the more we can seek truth, information the better off we're gonna be in most crisis situations. Another thing I noticed that several of the people talking about was having hope. And I think that was another thing that Caplan talked about was… is having hope and optimism about a future and trusting that things will get better, having someone mentioned having blind faith. And I think that surrendering the idea to… to surrender to the situation, let it be as it is, fits in with that whole model. Umm… Interestingly enough another one of Caplan's effective characteristics of coping with breaking things down into manageable bits and we heard some people talking about that too, not getting overwhelmed, maybe doing one thing at a time as it comes to you, living one day at a time and not feeling like the crisis has to be solved all at once but accepting that I can do a little bit at a time, so it’s not to be overwhelmed. And if that means, maybe be in a denial just a little bit that can be helpful for our psyche. Sometimes we can’t handle everything all at once. So we do one little piece at a time. So I think our clients all demonstrated all of Caplan's characteristics of effective coping people, managing frustration. We’ve heard a few people saying they were frustrated and understanding that sometimes life isn’t fair. And so those were some of the characteristics people described as what helps them cope with situations. Another thing that was very interesting was helping them think differently about their problem. Some… some of them even said you know it’s how I think about it, I know it’s my thoughts about it and if they can just change their view of the… of the situation, they could then feel better about the situation. So it’s good to talk to people. It’s good to read on the… on the topic because often that does help us have a different view of the situation. If you can just get another person’s perspective, that’s why therapy is helpful because you are getting somebody's… else’s perspective on your situation and we can do that ourselves. There is worksheets where you can jot down what has happened in your life and what are your thoughts about that situation that make you feel bad and then if you could learn to dispute those thoughts and think a little bit more rationally and realistic and relatively speaking about the problem, instead of making mountains out of molehills or overgeneralizing or catastrophizing. Looking at things in perspective of an entire lifespan is often very helpful. So those were some of the interesting umm… highlighted coping strategies we saw from people and it’s interesting how they fit in very tightly with Caplan's model who pretty much created the whole field of the crisis intervention. People do these things normally and that’s what helps them cope. But I think most important is getting support from other people, expressing feelings, and talking about your… your problem with other people.
