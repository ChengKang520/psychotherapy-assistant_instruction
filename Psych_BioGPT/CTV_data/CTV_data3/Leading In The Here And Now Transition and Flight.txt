This video tape is the second of a three part series which demonstrates leadership roles as the group process evolves. Throughout the process the leader periodically interacts with a group of observers to discuss the key concepts of group development. AACD The Association for Specialists in Group Work, a division of the American Association for Counseling and Development presents: GROUP WORK: LEADING IN THE HERE AND NOW Led by Dr. Peg Carroll, Professor of Counselor Education, Fairfield University Part II Re-assessing Purpose 

00:00:00
BRENDA  Ah, I guess. (crosstalk) 

00:01:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Can you talk to Jean about this? 

00:01:40
BRENDA Yeah I, I feel that you took a risk earlier and that, well I wanted them to take risks also. 

00:01:50
JEAN Okay. right. I don't have a clear view of how I'm perceived. I think I, I like to be in groups because. (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
DR. PEG CARROLL You're here and you can talk about... (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
JEAN Okay. 

00:02:00
DR. PEG CARROLL ...not on how you perceive but what, what the purp, what your purpose is. 

00:02:05
JEAN Well, I hear things from people in ways I don't usually hear them. I mean that surprised me but ah, I'm glad that's, oh, I don't know, it's. (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Can I help you a little bit? 

00:02:15
JEAN Sure. 

00:02:15
DR. PEG CARROLL  Ah, is this, are you trying to say, "My purpose here is to learn new things about myself?" 

00:02:20
JEAN  That's not my primary purpose here but that's what happens. 

00:02:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  Hmm. Ah, okay you have a primary purpose. 

00:02:30
JEAN Well, uhm, I don't get much practice in talking to people and reaching out and, and wanting to, to, uhm, find somebody else so that's why I come. 

00:02:45
GINNY Hmm. 

00:02:45
JEAN That's good. That, that makes me feel good because I've been in groups with you other times and I, uhm, I'd, I'd like to hear more from you. Now, you make me feel very comfortable so, you're nice. You've felt good too, when you, (chuckles) when you leave here. 

00:03:00
GINNY  I'm comfortable sometimes when I heard Mary Anne say to you, "You threaten me," I went haaa. And then I, uhm, I won't, I don't know how I would feel. I saw you able to handle, and get back and get closer to Mary Anne. 

00:03:20
DR. PEG CARROLL  Could I... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
GINNY Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
DR. PEG CARROLL ...help you? 

00:03:25
GINNY And I'd like, too. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Could you... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
GINNY Yeah. 

00:03:25
DR. PEG CARROLL ...talk to Mary Anne and say that? 

00:03:25
GINNY Sure. I thought you were very real with Jean when you said, "You threaten me," but I, it was negative feedback. Ah, and sometimes that makes me a little nervous. Uhm, I don't, I don't always handle negative feedback or I get kind of, wow, you know. 

00:03:50
MARY ANNE (clears throat)I don't either. I have a tremendous fear of rejection and I tend to be a people pleaser so, but I'm, I was wondering because I, ah, I feel when you say you don't know if you feel comfortable with everyone in this group, I've been feeling that. I don't know. 

00:04:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  What is it you wanna ask Ginny? Ask about Ginny, or find out. 

00:04:10
MARY ANNE  Uhm, do you feel still, ah, I guess, I don't wanna ask you that question. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Without asking, right? (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
MARY ANNE Uh hmm, hmm. 

00:04:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Can you check to see what is your feeling in relation to Ginny that has to deal with you? (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
MARY ANNE I don't know if you trust me. 

00:04:25
GINNY  Uhm, I guess that, ah, I'm not sure, yet; I want to. I, uhm, like the fact that you were real with your feelings and that's what I would like you to be uh, with me and I have to deal with myself, (laughs) you know, uhm, and that's okay. Uhm, I think having, you know, a little bit of time to talk uhm, helps. 

00:04:55
DR. PEG CARROLL When you said, "I had to deal with myself and that's okay if," can you talk about that a little bit more? 

00:05:00
GINNY  Sure. If I'm uncomfortable with something that you say to me, uhm, I'll tell you and I'll, and I'll talk about it. And that would be dealing with me. 

00:05:10
DR. PEG CARROLL And that's hard to do. 

00:05:15
GINNY Yes, sometimes. 

00:05:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Alright. I heard you talk about the purpose and I heard you Jean, but, and I don't know about anyone else, your purpose. And Brenda, you did, too, and Lucy. 

00:05:30
DANUTA I just want to be honest with myself because sometimes I, ah, I, I really was very, ah, walk out of myself and I could say this to you because it was always very difficult and, and ah, it is still sometimes difficult for me to say to people about my feelings. Uhm, and somehow in this group it's okay. Uhm. 

00:05:55
DR. PEG CARROLL  And so you're talking about saying your feelings and Jean is talking about handling her feelings, so you have a different purpose. The other one says, I wanna be able to speak and, and be real... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
DANUTA Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
DR. PEG CARROLL ...and uhm, speak my feelings but I can, I think you're, you're, the opposite is I can take them. I can take your feelings, Mary Anne. Do I have that right? 

00:06:15
DANUTA  Yeah and I experience this too. I, as I was sitting next to you, Mary Anne, and when you spoke out, when Jean spoke to you I wanted to hug you. I just wanted to hold you and protect you. And. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
DR. PEG CARROLL You want to be a mother, huh? (laughing) 

00:06:30
DANUTA Yeah, and I, ah, I work with that. I didn't (laughs) but I was aware of that that that's what was going on within me, you know, you know, and I said no, she can handle. So ah, that's the second time to, probably my purpose of being here. 

00:06:50
BRENDA I'd like to just say to you that I understand that very well 'coz I have that feeling and I, one of my problems is that I wanna protect and save everybody, and that's, well, I wanted to jumped right there with Mary Anne before so I, I understand just what you're saying I have to work at that. 

00:07:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Is that a part of your purpose here? 

00:07:10
BRENDA Yeah I guess maybe that is along with, with the, with the risk part... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:07:15
BRENDA ...because I really hate to think that I, that that's a problem, that I do that but it is. 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:25
ART  When I first accepted to be a part of a group, I wasn't quite sure what I was going to say, what I was gonna get into except other than the fact that I wanted it to be a learning experience as you expressed. Uhm, today, I feel a lot more comfortable coming in, in touch with myself because that was what I wanted to do as I was driving here to get here. Uhm, what's happening on the outside is now becoming more real to me at this moment and because I want to be as something you said, uhm, to be honest with myself, and trying to get in touch with my feelings. I, I think outside of the group, the opportunity for getting in touch with myself doesn't really uhm, allow itself. I guess I'm, I'm ready to accept me at this moment. 

00:08:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  You've been talking and I've, I've been thinking about people that really spoke just as... (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
ART Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
DR. PEG CARROLL ...said the very thing you're saying now. I, I'd like you to, to ask, to see if my connections are the same as yours. Whom would you identify most within this group as you heard them speaking earlier saying that's me? Did you hear them? 

00:08:45
ART Yes, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Just give the names. 

00:08:50
ART Jean. Ah, when you expressed that you were connecting with Mary Anne. I was in between the two of you and I began to feel like I was part of the, you know, a ping-pong match or a tennis match or, and that was uncomfortable for me to be between the two of you going back and forth and, and I began to realize that's what's happening inside of me. I'm going back and forth between the two. And after a while as watching the two of you, you know, having the ah, interaction, I began to realize that ah, as you be, became more comfortable with each other, I became more comfortable to watch this interaction and I began to feel that this interaction was also a part of me; that's why I. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
MARY ANNE Oh, I. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
ART But that was going perfect. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
DR. PEG CARROLL But I'm wondering if this might be what you're saying if anyone else is hearing Art saying this which is uhm, make it good. 

00:09:50
MARY ANNE Hu-huh. 

00:09:50
DR. PEG CARROLL I heard someone go huh. 

00:09:50
MARY ANNE No, I was being, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
DR. PEG CARROLL You wanna talk to her? 

00:09:55
MARY ANNE Uhm, yes, I felt more comfortable before than I do now. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Are you talking to Art? 

00:10:05
MARY ANNE Art, yeah, and uhm, I could try. Hmm, yeah, I, I heard you saying, you know, I, I want things to be nice-nice, you know. I don't want, you know, any kind of, of, of entering a confrontation or expressing like Jeanie(ph), I heard you say, you know, when I said, "You threaten me," (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:10:25
MARY ANNE Uhm, that's, that's when I began to be real because I realized that Jean did. She no, you no longer do the, but uhm, I came like I, to grow, I guess, and to learn more about myself but now uhm, I didn't realize how on a cognitive level I was with this group again, and now I'm very much into feeling and I'm, and I'm, and I'm, uhm, ah, I don't, and I didn't know that's why I was here today and I really felt that it's too, (chuckles) it could be overwhelming for everyone, you know. I mean that's the way I feel. I feel like, uhm, I think that my first instinct was when I said I feel safe. (cough) I suppose it has to do with I know some of the people but that they're all counselors and like you, I haven't had a lot of time to really deal with my feelings and there has been a lot going on, and uhm, I don't want, I, I don't think (laughs) I wanna deal with them. So that's where I am now, you know, I'm really, I am, and that's why I'm so tired because I'm trying to control them. You know, (laughs) I don't know why I'm here. 

00:11:40
DR. PEG CARROLL When you say... (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
MARY ANNE Yes. 

00:11:45
DR. PEG CARROLL ...ah, (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
MARY ANNE Hmm. 

00:11:45
DR. PEG CARROLL you, you're all counselors, aren't you... (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
MARY ANNE Hmm. 

00:11:45
DR. PEG CARROLL ...I, I wonder if you're saying and I am too, and look at me. Is that what you're telling the group? I'm not sure what you're telling the group. And look at me... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
MARY ANNE Hmm. 

00:11:55
DR. PEG CARROLL ...I've got all these feelings and I'm afraid, if I'm afraid of where they're gonna go right now. That makes sense? 

00:12:00
MARY ANNE  Uhm, I guess I don't wanna take up everybody's time. 

00:12:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. I'm not worthy. 

00:12:10
MARY ANNE  Huh? Ah. 

00:12:15
ART I don't feel you're taking up my time... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
MARY ANNE Hmm. 

00:12:20
ART ...by your ah, expression. 

00:12:20
MARY ANNE  Hmm. Yeah. Uhm. 

00:12:25
JEAN I, I think I hear, I thought I heard you say you, that your feelings were too much. 

00:12:30
MARY ANNE Hmm. 

00:12:30
DR. PEG CARROLL What does that mean to you? 

00:12:35
JEAN Louder, bigger. (chuckle) 

00:12:35
DR. PEG CARROLL What's that? Say that again? 

00:12:35
JEAN  Louder feelings, bigger feelings, you know, somehow you perceive that whatever you have inside that is beyond our ability to handle. 

00:12:50
DR. PEG CARROLL When you talk about it on your own, and I'm sure you can speak for everyone else? 

00:12:50
JEAN  Well I, I heard that. I've always been receptive. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
DR. PEG CARROLL What is it that you wanna do? Do you wanna have to happen? 

00:12:55
JEAN Uhm, I, I want to tell her that. 

00:13:00
DR. PEG CARROLL There she is. 

00:13:00
JEAN  Uhm. 

00:13:05
DR. PEG CARROLL What do you wanna tell Mary Anne? 

00:13:10
JEAN How could, her feelings. (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah, we did, Mary Anne (inaudible ) you don't have any trouble talking to Mary Anne now. (crosstalk) 

00:13:13
JEAN Well, (laughs) yeah, I, I don't know quite how to say it to her. (laughing) Uhm, I'm not afraid of your feelings. 

00:13:20
DR. PEG CARROLL I don't really think that's what you wanted to say. 

00:13:20
JEAN Well, I thought my feelings were bigger at one point than I could handle, so I assume you're not gonna spread them out. So I have that sense that you, I don't know. I don't know how to say it but that's not how I perceive you as, as ah, having something overpowering in you knew that will hurt me if it comes out or something. 

00:13:50
DR. PEG CARROLL  Where is everyone else? 

00:13:55
DANUTA  I have that feeling like Mary Anne, like I know you at all because you opened up yourself and you said all those feelings I view inside and I have difficult time to, to know you. I kind of don't still have a sense of what is inside. It's, I am hearing and, and ah, I kinda, ah, I hear you many times and I still don't have a sense of you. I don't know if you can help me with that. 

00:14:30
JEAN I don't know. 

00:14:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Maybe someone else can help you. 

00:14:35
DANUTA Okay. 

00:14:35
BRENDA  I got to feeling, Jean that you wanted to say to Mary Anne, "It's okay, you say whatever it is that you're gonna say. I can handle it. I would like to know what you're feeling right now." I got the feeling that you wanted to almost reassure her but I didn't feel like you did reassure but it was in there. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
JEAN Yeah. Thank you. (laughs) Oh, I would rather know you whatever it is. I rather not miss it because you decided for me that it was too much for me. 

00:15:00
DR. PEG CARROLL  But it was hard for you to say, (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
JEAN Yeah. 

00:15:05
DR. PEG CARROLL that you really felt. (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
JEAN Yeah. 

00:15:05
DR. PEG CARROLL That's why I said to you, "What is it? I don't really think that's what you wanted to say to her. 

00:15:10
MARY ANNE I was just realizing something to Jean about what you said, you know, about uhm, feeling that I didn't think you could handle my feelings or you know I think what it is, is it goes back to what I really think about my purpose of being here but my purpose of being here was not (clears throat) to come and, uhm, you know, I like to be that, I like to be the listener and the helper and I really, I don't want, I don't want, I don't like (laughing) where I am, you know. I just don't like where I am, (chuckles) and I don't want to be ah, the helpee. (laughing) It's very hard for me and I mean, I could just feel when you stop. 

00:15:55
DR. PEG CARROLL I, I don't want to have feelings that I might not be able to handle. 

00:16:00
MARY ANNE Hmm. Well I, I, I, yeah. You know it's not, I can feel. I don't mind having feelings but I don't wanna dump on my limit. I mean I don't seek(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
  Yes, I know. 

00:16:15
MARY ANNE ...I just, I don't wanna be this. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DR. PEG CARROLL It's just here I am with all these experts. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
MARY ANNE I really feel like I'm in the fishbowl. 

00:16:15
DR. PEG CARROLL  You are. Here I am with all these experts? 

00:16:20
MARY ANNE Yeah. 

00:16:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:16:20
MARY ANNE But kind, ah, empathic people... (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
MARY ANNE ...maybe that's why. (chuckles) You know, I've been busy potpourring(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:16:30
MARY ANNE ...and running a lot so I haven't had time. I haven't gotten, made time for me. That's the bottom line to get in touch with it. And I'm tired and it's because I don't want to get in touch with it. And here I am (laughing) because that's what's happening. 

00:16:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Earlier, I said I'm not worthy and no one picked it up. 

00:16:55
BRENDA I'm, I heard you say that and I, and I, I felt for myself. 

00:17:00
DR. PEG CARROLL  You felt for yourself. 

00:17:05
BRENDA I felt but, but I was gonna say I also felt for Mary Anne because I almost feel as if you're, you're saying I'm not gonna dump what's inside on you because it's gonna, that's gonna be a waste of everybody's time. I wanna take everybody else's stuff. I don't wanna deal with my stuff now; it's a waste of time to deal with my stuff. 

00:17:20
DR. PEG CARROLL How about when you said I felt for myself, what did that mean to you?... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
BRENDA I understand that because I wouldn't wanna bore everybody with all my stuff either. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
DR. PEG CARROLL I'm not worthy, either. Hmm? I'm not worthy... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
BRENDA Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
DR. PEG CARROLL ...of this group's time. 

00:17:35
BRENDA Yeah. I don't want to think of it that way but. 

00:17:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay, I wanna stop here. You may wonder why I'm stopping at this tender moment but I want to, I think this is a, this is a, there is something to be learned here and what's happening. I've been doing, what have I been doing? Yeah. 

00:17:55
 You are posturing identification with, among the members of the group. 

00:18:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh, uh-huh. Anita? 

00:18:00
ANITA I think when, when you're starting with setting goals and, and everyone said what they wanted to happen which is what was going to happen by saying it. (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:18:10
ANITA And also I think now you're getting information or you're having and getting information for all different kinds of feelings, the negative as well as the positive... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:18:15
ANITA ...we've got great ones. (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh, Okay. Good. Now something that is important as a leader that you think of the orchestra and you have tambourines and trumpets and drums and things like that, and until every instrument is playing in concert, you don't have an orchestra. Now what, of, often what a leader will do is aha! I have someone who will reveal. What have I been doing? Can you, can you actually pinpoint and describe the process of what I've been doing that you've observed me doing? Yeah. 

00:18:50
 Well then ah, you watch nonverbal behavior. (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:18:55
 When Jean talked, you saw some of the nods... (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:18:55
 ...and it was interesting that Brenda drew Jean out and you didn't have to do it as the leader... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. 

00:19:00
 ...so that other people are taking on the leadership duties of clarifying and drawing people out... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:19:05
 ...and that when anyone else then began to talk especially Mary Anne, you sort of slowed it down to see who, who else was feeling what Mary Anne was feeling. 

00:19:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. When Mary Anne said I am vulnerable, there was an opportunity for you in ex, inexperienced leader moving in, all right? Now that would work; however, what have I been doing not to have that happen? Jim. 

00:19:30
JIM Isn't it that would set the norm of you work individually with the leaders and. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay, you work individually, good point. I hadn't thought about that. That's a good point. (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
JIM Uh-huh. 

00:19:40
 You're asking where is everyone else. 

00:19:40
DR. PEG CARROLL All right, okay. Now, who particularly am I working with, I am, ah, I am planning it. What am I planning as I'm doing this? Can you, can you see that? When you're saying, you're saying, "Well, why doesn't she take advantage of it?" You weren't. Why weren't you? You weren't. You're shaking your head, Helen. 

00:19:55
HELEN  Well, it seemed like you were working on, I was going to repeat what everybody else said... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:20:05
HELEN ...of getting everybody to be involved also... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:20:05
HELEN ...and ah, and that. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  Ah, all right. And that, how did I do that? What was the process, Ingrid? 

00:20:10
INGRID Well, I think, it seems you were picking up on Brenda sharing that same feeling and allowing it not just to be Mary Anne's thing but also including Brenda's... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Good. All right. 

00:20:20
INGRID ...so it's one more member of the group. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
DR. PEG CARROLL What is that teaching Mary Anne? So there's a teaching, this is a teaching process. What is it teaching her? 

00:20:25
  Universality in terms of you are, you are not standing here alone... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:20:30
 ...and I felt one of the techniques you use is you were quiet sometimes (chuckles), and I think it's okay, too, 'coz then somebody else comes in and I think you became in at one point and when you see silence... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:20:40
  and so there, there is no isolate here. 

00:20:45
DR. PEG CARROLL All right. Good term... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:20:45
DR. PEG CARROLL ...isolate. Aileen? (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
AILEEN  I think the issue of, of worth is really important that, that you emphasize that people may feel that they're not worthy enough to really get into their own process... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
AILEEN ...and so you're, you're making more a, a clear norm that each one of the members of the group is worthy of the other group member's time and energy. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:21:05
AILEEN And that's really important. 

00:21:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Did you notice how when I said I'm not worthy and it just fell flat? (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Did you notice how I came back to it? So what you wanna do is remember what you're doing and why you're doing it then, then you come back to it and then the per, someone says, "Yeah, I heard it," everyone hears it, everyone hears what you do. Why is it that they're not picking up on it? (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
 Sort of resistance. 

00:21:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:21:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah, resistance. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
 Uh-huh. 

00:21:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Not ready is another nice way of putting it. Not ready. (laughter) Okay. Do you have any questions? Gail? 

00:21:35
GAIL Well, ah, you, do the sense of the universal, universality of the feelings that are coming up but it seems like you're also trying to get people to become in touch with their own individual purposes and feelings... (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. 

00:21:50
GAIL ...in setting their own goals so that as the group seems to become more cohesive as a group, individuals seem to be going deeper within themselves... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. PEG CARROLL  Yeah, okay Aileen? 

00:22:00
AILEEN ...and when you use the term mothering with Danuta stop... (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Hu-huh. 

00:22:00
AILEEN  labeling? 

00:22:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah, but she said it, I'm the mother and so has Brenda said it, yeah. I wonder. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
AILEEN But (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:22:09
DR. PEG CARROLL You also made a good point. The last time I have to do that ah, anymore because I don't want them to perceive themselves as mother figures and, but that, that was my mistake really, thank you for mentioning it... (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
AILEEN Okay. I want you to be. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
DR. PEG CARROLL  no, no, no but I, I really try not to do that and ah, it could be, you know, that's a good point. It could be that's something I don't like at all, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
 Yeah. 

00:22:25
DR. PEG CARROLL It could be my problem. (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  Dark mother me (laughing) (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
 Uh-huh (laughing). 

00:22:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Male or female and what you have to do as a leader is constantly monitor where you are... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
 Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
DR. PEG CARROLL ...constantly look at how you're feeling about people, liking somebody so much, caring so much about them. That happens. You sit there, you look at someone and you say, "Oh, you know, I, I know you feel it. Please express it so I have to keep checking where I am." And that very well could be something that I've never thought too much about, and I shall from now on. (laughing) 

00:22:50
AILEEN Well, suppose you have negative feelings towards someone in the group as the leader. 

00:22:55
DR. PEG CARROLL I'll leave him alone. (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
AILEEN Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. But you have to be very careful if you don't like someone. You don't, you don't go after them because you're, you've got yourself in there. 

00:23:05
The Group in Transition 

00:23:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  Okay, where would you like to begin? 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:15
LUCY  I guess I feel cut off. I'd like to feel closer to people but I feel cut off. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. Who do you feel the most connected to? 

00:23:35
LUCY In the whole group? 

00:23:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm. 

00:23:35
LUCY Mary Anne. I don't know, I've had, I've had a way of being sure of uhm, feelings. Uhm, part of it was sadness when people were talking about how hard it is outside the group, not to have anybody to talk to. That, that's what I felt. So then I feel something about uhm, distancing that you are such an attractive woman that sometimes that, that, that, that just doesn't seem to flow, that sometimes people can distance from you. I've all seen, you make sense a while ago but it doesn't seem to you to know. I can't remember what the flow was. 

00:24:20
DR. PEG CARROLL I get, what I get the sense that's what happened to you, there are lot is going on out here and a lot is going on in here but you're not really in this process. 

00:24:30
 I guess I, when I heard you connect with Jean in relation to feelings of sadness because there wasn't someone to share with on the outside, I liked that 'coz uhm, that to me is, is lonely inside not, you know, not to be connected and uhm, so I was feeling that you were, you were feeling some feelings then when Jean spoke, and, and I would like you to share those as, as we go on. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
LUCY It means feel that when it happens? (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
 Yeah. 

00:25:05
 I'll try, too... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
LUCY Okay. 

00:25:05
 ...because I, sometimes I don't, sometimes I, (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
LUCY Hold back. 

00:25:05
 I have to, to sit and, you know, and wonder. I'll try to get in touch with Mary Anne and sometimes I, sometimes I don't know, and I wish I do. 

00:25:15
  I guess when I'm here as I have to stay more right here. 

00:25:20
 Right. Uh-huh. 

00:25:20
MARY ANNE  I feel that you're trying to help me, you know, with the, and, and there's some identification with what I'm feeling. But I was almost saying to myself oh, good. (laughs) Focus is on you now. I'm off the hot seat and that's why I didn't wanna talk again but I need to tell you I feel. Uhm, I don't know that you need understanding? (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Because of chemistry. 

00:25:55
MARY ANNE My feeling, yeah. 

00:25:55
LUCY Because of chemistry, yeah. 

00:25:55
MARY ANNE  Oh also, uhm, you know I like before when you, when you reveal which I think takes a lot of courage and thought at the beginning that you were used to being open because you're a member of AA, well so am I. So, And I didn't know. I mean and that's a bond in itself and uhm, I didn't know what I was gonna reveal, though, not until now but. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
LUCY Thank you for sharing that with me. 

00:26:20
MARY ANNE  So. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:30
JEAN  I, I just have to say that you, you make me feel good and I just, I fear it when people will kind of need each other. (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Just talk to them and not to people. 

00:26:45
JEAN  I like that. 

00:26:50
DR. PEG CARROLL What that it do to you? For you? What are you experiencing inside? 

00:26:55
JEAN  I don't know, just kind of a clapping, you know. You know, already two people, they touched. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
DR. PEG CARROLL  It's kinda hard for you to get down here. Isn't it hard? 

00:27:10
JEAN Yeah. I guess. 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:15
DANUTA  And you know I'd like to say ah, that I am where you are but the second part of me is saying to me ah, where I am not included ah, where it's, not to connect so closely as we do ah, uhm, but I am doing that. It doesn't happen to me and, uhm, I don't know. 

00:27:45
MARY ANNE  Oh, I feel your, your, I feel your, your caring Danuta, I mean, and you're very real but I can't, I know you can't rescue me, (laughs) you know. And, and Brenda, too, ah, you can't, you can't help me. I feel better now because I feel more real and it's been bothering me since you revealed that because that, there's an immediate bond to me, all right? (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
LUCY Hu-huh. 

00:28:20
MARY ANNE Because, and it was bothering me that I, I knew I was going to have to, to reveal that at some point, let's say. 

00:28:30
LUCY Oh, I hope I didn't mean to. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
MARY ANNE No, no. I just mean, uhm, you know, uhm, because it's, it's an important part of my life, but I think that I've learned that I'm very open about being a member of AA but I, I, I, I have to be selective. Some people don't understand the disease, and I've seen a lot of people get hurt by being open and prejudiced against them and all so that's why it's an anonymous program and, (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
 Uh-huh. 

00:29:05
MARY ANNE and all and... (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
DR. PEG CARROLL But you're meeting here, Mary Anne. 

00:29:05
MARY ANNE ...so maybe I didn't feel safe, that safe to, to, you know, which you didn't mean it... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:29:10
MARY ANNE ...to maybe be that self-revealing. 

00:29:15
DR. PEG CARROLL When you say I might have been hurt here? 

00:29:15
MARY ANNE Yeah. 

00:29:15
DR. PEG CARROLL And you talked about that vulnerability earlier... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
MARY ANNE Uh-huh. 

00:29:20
DR. PEG CARROLL ...and I, and I think that what you're saying that would be one more thing. I'm feeling vulnerable and then to be hurt on top of it for something that's me could be heard, uh too much. Does that make sense? (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
MARY ANNE But I'm not as courageous as Lucy. 

00:29:30
ART  I'm actually beginning to feel that I'm comfortable now. I, I sense ah, a very wonderful thing happening between the two of you, but I'm also having a feeling that unless I reveal something to the group to become a part of the group then I'm not a part of the group. And going back to what you were saying before of feeling unworthy, I'm wondering now if I have anything that's worthy to say to feel a part of the group. And yet I feel I have nothing or want nothing to share at this point because maybe I still wanna be a part of the group. And ah, I'm wondering if other people are feeling like I'm doing or I am getting at this moment. Uhm, as you were saying, you don't have anything to share and yet you were saying that when they share, we feel connected with them. And I'm, I'd get distanced by that 'coz I don't feel like I could become a part of the group unless I contribute something of myself. I don't know if I'm coming across. 

00:30:50
BRENDA I understand because I, I learned that's how I felt. I feel better now because I, I think when you said that to me ah, before when I got this, another feedback I feel, I feel better than I did earlier, but I think it's because I, I was able to say something and I felt that it was all right for me to say that. 

00:31:10
ART Uh-huh. 

00:31:10
DR. PEG CARROLL  What is it you're saying to Art, talk? 

00:31:15
BRENDA I guess what I'm, I'm saying that it's okay. I, I guess, I wanna say that it was, it was all right to do that for me, and that I wish that, I wish that you could feel connected with the group. 

00:31:30
ART  It's, it's all right to, to feel unworthy or all right to feel what ah, they're sharing. I, I don't. 

00:31:40
BRENDA Ah, it's, it's all right to say whatever it is like you're thinking... (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
ART Uhm. 

00:31:45
BRENDA ...uhm, because I want you to be, I, I want you to be connected with the group. 

00:31:50
ART I do, too. And I feel there is almost ah, well, feel myself almost a need to give something to the group ah, so that there is a connection and, and yet all I feel at this moment is simply stating that, that, that's, that's what I, I wanna give that I don't have any, uhm, any underlying anxiety or. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
DR. PEG CARROLL At her, can I help you? I think you... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ART Yes. 

00:32:15
DR. PEG CARROLL ...are saying Art, being Art here really I don't feel is enough, just being Art... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
ART Yes. 

00:32:20
DR. PEG CARROLL ...is not enough. 

00:32:20
ART Exactly. 

00:32:20
 Uh-huh. 

00:32:20
DR. PEG CARROLL What would you like to do? 

00:32:20
MARY ANNE I was just gonna say or I, I don't feel that you have to reveal something about yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
ART Okay but. (laughs) 

00:32:25
BRENDA  Yeah. That's right.(crosstalk) 

00:32:30
MARY ANNE Necessarily, but I do feel that you, you uhm, accepted by you. You're not judging and, and you care and, and so that's, that's being a group member. I mean that's important. I felt that right from the beginning. 

00:32:45
JEAN And, and you're a very important part of that exchange we had because, you know, it would have been bad to be sitting next to two people crying in the first five minutes. It's just, just wasn't gonna, I mean there had to be a certain distance and you were that and you really were kind of a middle person so when you said you were split, I should have said something. It was exactly what I was feeling. You're really important. 

00:33:05
ART It was important for me... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
JEAN To be right even better. 

00:33:05
ART ...not to say anything at that. 

00:33:05
JEAN  You don't have to say a thing. 

00:33:10
ART There's the. (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
JEAN There was a sense of somebody else that was, uhm, may, may not felt you were there. And uhm, I needed that, that much space when we were doing that because that was scary, but uhm, you're important. 

00:33:20
DR. PEG CARROLL So, let's get back a bit here in this group. Feelings are scary. Emotion is scary for you. 

00:33:30
JEAN Well. 

00:33:30
DR. PEG CARROLL What you're saying here. There have been times when you've been a little scared right here. (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
JEAN Yeah. 

00:33:30
DR. PEG CARROLL  Uh hmm. Okay. On the other hand, earlier you said, What can you reveal? I can handle it." And then now you're saying it's scary. 

00:33:40
JEAN My feelings. 

00:33:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm. 

00:33:40
JEAN  I don't know I have any. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
DR. PEG CARROLL (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:33:46
JEAN I was... (crosstalk) 

00:33:46
DR. PEG CARROLL ...is so scary. 

00:33:46
JEAN Yes. 

00:33:46
DR. PEG CARROLL Is that what you're saying? 

00:33:46
JEAN The exchange of feelings is scary. 

00:33:50
DR. PEG CARROLL For you. For you to exchange your feelings is scary. 

00:33:50
JEAN Uh hmm. And that's why I wanted to finish with Brenda a minute. It's not that, my feeling is not your feeling of I don't wanna take the time but identify with your need to participate and be the giver because if my feelings are out there too much then I'm not listening anymore. 

00:34:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
JEAN  So I'm no longer listening to you, I'm no longer aware of what I'm doing, and this whole thing is gonna get crosswired somewhere and then I don't know what's happening anymore... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
DR. PEG CARROLL You just... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
JEAN ...but I wanna know. 

00:34:15
DR. PEG CARROLL ...wanna keep all those controls on your head, huh? You don't... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
JEAN A few. 

00:34:20
DR. PEG CARROLL ...wanna let it go. (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
JEAN I'd like a few. (laughing) So I, I hear you and I think it's similar, but not exactly. 

00:34:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
BRENDA Well I, I guess it's not that. It's totally, totally unworthy but I, you just said that about uhm, not being able to say and listen and do everything at once... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
JEAN At the same time. 

00:34:40
BRENDA ...that I understand. 

00:34:40
DR. PEG CARROLL  Okay, I'd like to stop here. Now, uhm, what would you like to do in the outside? Do you wanna comment on the process? Last question about the process or what? What is it you learned? What did you observe? Helen. 

00:34:55
HELEN  Uhm, when you say that I'm feeling uhm, a little bit uncomfortable being an observer in such an intimate exchange... (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. 

00:35:05
HELEN ...and I just wanted to say that I've really been touched by everybody. 

00:35:10
DR. PEG CARROLL All right. 

00:35:10
HELEN I'd rather not comment on that. 

00:35:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Well, I don't want actually do that though, because that has to do with you. 

00:35:15
HELEN Okay. 

00:35:15
DR. PEG CARROLL All right, I'm, I'm unable to be objective on the process because I can do the same thing. I could say, "I'm just so touch by what you're all doing" and say that I cannot respond as a leader. So that, that would help everyone, you're saying that. So I want you to stand there and be absolutely objective and look at it as a good experience. That's hard to do for people who are learning and most people learn to run groups this way by staying on the outside. Ellen. 

00:35:35
ELLEN  I was noticing a change in your, I think your voice got softer and gentler. 

00:35:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
ELLEN I mean, if we didn't pick anything else up, if we just listen to how you're setting the tone with the quality of your voice. You were just, you knew we were going into deeper water... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
ELLEN ...when you were responding to each person or I felt that too. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
DR. PEG CARROLL That is a very good point. Yes, and I do that deliberately... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
DR. PEG CARROLL ..of course, I feel it myself also but it is very important. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
 Of course. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. PEG CARROLL  Yeah, Pat. 

00:36:05
PAT I was thinking that (inaudible ) and Miles(ph) have good leadership characteristics... (crosstalk) 

00:36:07
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:36:07
PAT  when you said feelings are, uhm, been, being, uhm, carrying my rag(ph) but sometimes is not enough in that like that's an existential dilemma. 

00:36:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
PAT Is that people really wanna feel like being part of this group... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DR. PEG CARROLL  Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
PAT ...and that I would describe it as leadership behavior as in terms of needing attribution that, that you were giving meaning to this experience. 

00:36:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. One problem I had here is that I, I was having trouble interpreting the process and having people talk about feelings at the same time because I do not want this group only took express feelings and say we've got to feel because that really isn't enough. You have to help people leave the group with a cognitive map, so to speak. So then they walk out. They have something they've learned that they can take with them and that's what's hard in the process. But if you start interpreting earlier as I said before, you lose in the here and now, and we're moving in and out. 

00:37:00
PAT But, but you do do interpreting in these, in these interludes. 

00:37:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, hmm, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
PAT Your a model, you, you don't do meaning attribution as what are your leadership behavior is... (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
PAT ...but in these interludes, you'd do that. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Here, (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
PAT Yes. 

00:37:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Yes. Yeah, I'm telling you what I'm thinking while I'm there. 

00:37:10
PAT Right. 

00:37:10
DR. PEG CARROLL  That's why it's that, that process helps people learn, helps these people learn, too. Gail? 

00:37:15
GAIL  There was a long in silence at the beginning... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
GAIL ...of, of the group and I'm sure about, when you're first beginning to lead groups... (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:37:25
GAIL ...that silence seems a lot longer than, than it really is. 

00:37:25
DR. PEG CARROLL  Yeah. 

00:37:30
GAIL If you let it go, how long would you let it go? 

00:37:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Well, (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
GAIL I just. (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
DR. PEG CARROLL This, this was short, (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
GAIL No. 

00:37:35
DR. PEG CARROLL (laughing) Very short. I don't wanna go in the "how long" 'coz I think I'm gonna be able to demonstrate what I would do, okay? 

00:37:40
 Hmm. 

00:37:40
DR. PEG CARROLL But this was a short silence. I have lots of reading of nonverbals here and I knew, I knew who was gonna start. You got to know. You can always clue people, too, to begin. 

00:37:50
 You started by saying, "Where would you like to begin?" 

00:37:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm, on the second time. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
AILEEN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
DR. PEG CARROLL First time I gave them a little thing, yeah. 

00:37:55
AILEEN Is that what you would... (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
DR. PEG CARROLL  That's what I would. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
AILEEN ...you would think. You wouldn't necessarily summarize because you. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Never. 

00:38:00
AILEEN Never. 

00:38:00
DR. PEG CARROLL You see I, I did what I did here which is what I do and where do you wanna begin, what does that do to the group when you say that, "Where do you wanna begin?" 

00:38:05
AILEEN  It gives them the power. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
DR. PEG CARROLL They may know how to take it but you're forcing it on them, now Helen you've got to say something, good! 

00:38:15
HELEN I was just uhm, watching after that exchange between Lucy and Mary Anne that it was so powerful... (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
HELEN ...how you brought the rest of the group and I say ah, what's the process doing to everybody else there? 

00:38:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
HELEN And I was wondering at that time how are we going to move from that to bring in everybody else. 

00:38:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Did you see what happened? (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
HELEN And, and everybody else came in. 

00:38:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Is everybody else in? 

00:38:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
HELEN Well, (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
 No. 

00:38:35
HELEN  Not everybody but Ginny and Art and Evelyn, and Jean came back... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
HELEN ...one after the other. 

00:38:45
DR. PEG CARROLL You, you can't see that well. Someone over here says no. Not every, anyone wanna comment on that? 

00:38:50
 I mean no, not everyone is seeing and I was wondering what you're going to do about that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
DR. PEG CARROLL  Well, that is very important to give people space. Read the nonverbals. If you see a member is not actively involved with you, look at that person and you know they're there, there, that's okay because the group is gonna take care of him in time. Because if you, two things will occur, if you call on people, you're teaching them that you're gonna do their work, number one. If you call on people, you're gonna threaten them. And what I try to do as much as possible is to not intimidate, and intimidate earlier by human and all of that but that has to do with the ground rules, but not to call on people because they will learn that, that I will do that and they'll be very anxious. Jim? 

00:39:30
JIM Would the, I, I think the comment that I was talking about was being, just being Art here isn't enough. Is that. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Just being right here? 

00:39:40
JIM Art here isn't enough. Is that... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Oh yeah, that's right. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
JIM  trying to draw everyone back here? 

00:39:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Worthy or else, or to, well yes, because he was really saying, "Gosh, I don't have all these deep things in my soul to bring out. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
JIM Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
DR. PEG CARROLL What people think is I've gotta give you a story... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
JIM Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
DR. PEG CARROLL ...but, but, but what one experiences is what you wanna have brought out, not the story. (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
JIM Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
DR. PEG CARROLL And that's what so hard for people to let go. This is probably I think uhm, well I, I think it's very difficult to teach people this process because you're seduced by the story as a leader and you don't wanna hear the story. You wanna say what is it you're getting and what do you experience with us giving us the story? And people are afraid they have to tell a story, okay? Yeah. 

00:40:20
PAT I noticed there's an interesting norm established that you are the only person in group who, who can ask open-ended questions to the group. 

00:40:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. (laughs) 

00:40:25
PAT  And whenever we (inaudible ), you challenge them to make I statements. 

00:40:31
DR. PEG CARROLL  Right. I don't have any means in here, I need... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
PAT Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
DR. PEG CARROLL ...some mean people who say, "Look, you're asking all the questions. I wanna ask some of them." Then, then you have a lot of problem with that. You have to be able to take it and I am perfectly willing to be the bad guy, bad woman. I'm perfectly going to have people get mad at me. This group is not getting as mad but they did deal with the authority issue in other ways but that's another one. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
ELLEN I have one more comment that I noticed what I feel is a good technique in terms of how good this progressing, you will go back to comments people made earlier and... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
ELLEN ...and so there is a sense of instead of things being scattered and just here and now... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm. 

00:41:05
ELLEN ...there is a pathway that people were going down... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
ELLEN ...and I think you help make that clarified there... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:41:10
ELLEN ...it gives a sense of continuity to the group. 

00:41:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. It's very important to be able to remember what has happened in the past... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:41:15
DR. PEG CARROLL ...so that you can bring it in into, so that if you're, if you're anxious and you're not remembering, I find that if I'm not remembering everyone in trouble I have to remember and I concentrate on that. Remember what people said in the past, all right? (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
INGRID We're all like that. I noticed that one of the things that, I hadn't noticed that I do this time is that while, especially in the stories were being told about the revelation, there's a lot of fear... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
INGRID ...I watched your eyes and you, you were constantly going around the circle and I thought I know my tendency would be to caught, to get caught... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Hmm. 

00:41:45
INGRID ...in my emotion of listening. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:41:45
INGRID But I was very aware as I hadn't been in the other two sessions that you're keeping your eye on everyone... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
INGRID ...checking out how they are reacting, responding, what their messages were... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
DR. PEG CARROLL  That is a very good point. (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
INGRID ...and then decided what move to make. 

00:41:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Right, because you're keeping in your head and ah, recognize. There are a few people who, not everyone shows feeling the same way, but you store in your head, what that person experienced that did not express because, you know, it's going to be there all along because that has to be expressed. As Mary Anne said, "I had to say it." Feelings that come about in this group have to be expressed eventually. One last question, Helen? 

00:42:20
HELEN Uhm, I was also beginning to feel reassured again that people are not going to be left with unfinished business. Wherein... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
HELEN ...you move from one person to the other and left Evelyn, and you knew that I was feeling that they were left. (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
HELEN And I'm beginning to get the sense that you keep coming back to them and ah... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Right. That's right. Yeah, that's very important. Okay, we will stop and have lunch, okay. Now. 

00:42:45
The Group in Flight 

00:42:45
DR. PEG CARROLL  Where would you like to start? 

00:42:50
GINNY  I wanna start. Art, I wanna tell you that I feel you're very much a part of the group and the fact that you shared what you shared, you made you real to me. I thought that was really important to hear. And I guess I feel that uhm, I've kind of left you out, Ron, because I haven't said anything to you at all, and uhm. I missed you at the last session. Uhm, I felt that you were there uhm, and listening but I would like to have heard from you, too. That would be important for me. 

00:43:30
RON  I, I think I haven't, I feel an apology to the group that I, I didn't partake. But something was happening to me ah, something that ah, I'm aware of that happens. I'm a very cognitive individual, Ginny and, what was happening was ah, I was linking up with a lot of people very quickly, with Mary Anne, ah, with Lucy, with Art, with Jean, with Brenda, and I think my emotions are coming out which is not an easy thing for me, ah, but linking up with those people for different reasons but the emotions were there and I was not with the group. I wasn't thinking; I was feeling and a lot of the times I was forgetting or not hearing what people were saying unless they came up with an emotion. And I heard the word "I think," I didn't hear it. I'm sure it came up from the group. But when someone said something about the feeling or something that was emotional for them, I tuned in, and I, I have a hard time leaving that cognitive domain to, to stop dealing with the feelings. I've masked them for years. Ah, it's important to find someone that you can share your feelings with. I have the people to share them with but won't let them out. There's vulnerability to that, and I don't let them out. So I have the people on the outside, but I just don't do it. Feelings for me would be taking up time, not the thought process as we're all here for education of some type. But the thought problems like who, who cares, not who cares, maybe that's a wrong term interpreting but like you, we got the same problems. It's okay just say them. 

00:45:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Let's stay with that again. Where at last can I put that feeling that's taking up time. 

00:45:25
JEAN  And I connect, too, but not that particular sense but it is a little like, well who cares, you know, we're fairly intelligent. We know what we feel probably other people feel but, you know, do we really need to do this? You know, I have those feelings. 

00:45:45
DR. PEG CARROLL  So why talk about them? Because they're here, they're there? 

00:45:50
JEAN Well uhm, I'll check it out. 

00:45:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Am I biased? 

00:45:55
JEAN I'd check it out, because what you two did was exceptional to, to feel with her and to reach out and let it go back and forth. I thought that was really exceptional. That's not my common experience with. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
DR. PEG CARROLL You mean that's gonna be the end of it in this group?...(crosstalk) 

00:46:10
JEAN  No, no. I was. (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Here we are, two people at risk and here we are? Is that what you want? 

00:46:15
DANUTA  I asked you before and, and again I, I have a hard time hearing you from inside, you know, what is going to come within you everytime you, I hear something it seems to be about somebody else, and I've had a hard time with this. But I have a hard time in this group now, anyway, because ah, I took risks twice and nobody responded except ah, Mary Anne. And ah, I'm not going to get back this time (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:46:56
DR. PEG CARROLL You felt you didn't get any feedback with anyone. (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
DANUTA I didn't, I didn't get any feedback and it was very difficult for me to say what I said because it was ah, it was what I felt. And ah, when I didn't get any feedback, my head was saying to me, "That's okay, that's where they are, and blah, blah, blah." And my heart was saying to me and my guts were saying to me, uhm, "No, it isn't okay, you're, you're feeling all those feeling got being ignored or, or not fulfilled or whatever there is. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:40
GINNY  After that, I'm feeling not well. And I, I feel responsible. 

00:47:50
DANUTA  I feel very comfortable right now because now it seems like I ask for it and now I'm getting this all positive feedback, and it's difficult for me. 

00:48:05
DR. PEG CARROLL (inaudible ). 

00:48:10
DANUTA There's something about. (laughter) 

00:48:10
DR. PEG CARROLL  You want me to do this more. 

00:48:15
RON  Danuta, what you just said, I'm having a real hard time for me because here I know, like Ginny I feel guilty but I feel guilty because I was involved with my feelings and just reinforces me again. Don't get involved with your feelings. You lost somebody. The group should be helping the group. The group is becoming one hopefully. And I was like someone's new person's broken arm. I, I didn't function properly. But I have expectations of myself that I, I shouldn't have. 

00:48:55
MARY ANNE  But if you feedback to me from a cognitive level verbally rather than feeling with me nonverbally that, it's the feeling with me is the oneness. 

00:49:10
RON But that's the point. I, I didn't verbalize the feelings. 

00:49:15
DR. PEG CARROLL We heard from Mary Anne, and Ron, and Danuta . I'm wondering if the rest of you can, in one word, say where you are. What's the, the feeling word that, that you have? 

00:49:35
[sil.] 

00:49:35
ART  I'm feeling a lot of empathy with what's going on between the two of you and. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay, just like we were. 

00:49:45
ART Okay. 

00:49:45
  Compassionate? 

00:49:50
DR. PEG CARROLL You're feeling compassionate? 

00:49:50
LUCY  I'm more, I'm more at, (inaudible ). 

00:49:57
BRENDA  I'm feeling very touched from what Ron has said. 

00:50:00
  To be very involved and, and caught up, I wish I was a part of it. 

00:50:15
[sil.] 

00:50:15
JEAN  I'm feeling very resistant. 

00:50:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. Well, what is happening that you're, you're empathizing, whatever you're feeling, caught up here and there but you're letting them do it all. So what is it that you wanna do? 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:40
MARY ANNE  I'm getting upset that, that somebody else, I feel that you said something very crucial about, you know, for the first time, you know, being able to get out of the cognitive area and, and it made you vulnerable and I, you know, I mean, I, I feel your feelings that it makes more of a bond for me and I don't understand why I'm in that, well, I guess, does anybody else feel that way that, do you feel some urgency that he may say I'll never do this again? 

00:51:15
DR. PEG CARROLL You're feeling desperate now? 

00:51:15
BRENDA Yeah. Right. I, I feel such genuineness. I really feel that from you, Ron. It's very strong. 

00:51:25
DR. PEG CARROLL What is it that you wanna tell him? 

00:51:25
BRENDA I wanna tell him to stay with it. 

00:51:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Tell him. Talk to him. (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
BRENDA Ron, stay with it and, and, and don't give it up because it's so, I, I think sometimes it's really hard to get. 

00:51:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Hard for you? 

00:51:35
BRENDA  Sometimes, sometimes it is... (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:51:40
BRENDA ...and I think that if you can have that, I want you to keep it. 

00:51:45
GINNY I liked that, and I, I guess they might (inaudible ) that. It was a lot of strength thing. Uhm, it makes me feel that maybe I could risk too, maybe, and then I like some of this stuff and I don't want to say you feel that you really hurt me, or are ah, everybody else in, in not sharing the feelings or not be what you really are. There's the whole different side of you. I like that side. 

00:52:15
RON I thank everybody but I, I'm feeling very uncomfortable people talking to me and about me. 

00:52:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Maybe I can help you here because the whole group responded when I said give me an adjective and each one of you spoke and you were feeling compassion, but one person who said, "I feel resistant." 

00:52:30
LUCY  Resistance is just part of, for me it can just be part, too, of a feeling and you can change as more people talk and share. 

00:52:40
DR. PEG CARROLL  Well, moving into it the group that's just so very nice to everybody and everybody was saying it's okay (inaudible ). Well, I would say where are we gonna go from there? It's okay to be resistant. It's okay to feel good and okay to have feelings. And so the process is making it okay to just feel good. 

00:53:05
DANUTA But ah, when I hear it, I think every time I talk, I kinda try to, but uhm, have this feeling and ah, I want to, you to know these feelings so I did a little work and I would like Jean, if you maybe could do and give a little more about this resistance because I would like to know more, I would like to know you more. 

00:53:35
MARY ANNE I wanna know what the resistance is but I don't wanna talk anymore, you know, because I'm back to where I was at the beginning, you know, and I just... (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
JEAN  Yeah. 

00:53:45
MARY ANNE ...and it's what you said before and, and different people said, "I don't want," I don't know what word it is. I don't want to, I don't wanna talk so much. 

00:53:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Let me go back to Mary Anne because I want to take this up really with you. From the beginning you said, "I am so vulnerable and I'm feeling so much. 

00:54:00
 Yeah. 

00:54:00
DR. PEG CARROLL That I really worry about taking the groups' time and talking, and talking about it." You're saying that again but on the other hand you said, "Hey, Ron, don't get rid of it. Don't stop it. Don't let it go. Stay with it. Stay with it." And I got to sense early you were saying, "I like to shut out these feelings because it's, it's, I'm so vulnerable. There's so much of me here." So I get the sense, you're talking right hand, left hand. I'd like to help you to know where you are. What is it you want? 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:40
MARY ANNE  I want the feeling of oneness in here... (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:54:50
MARY ANNE ...very badly but I don't want to... (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
DR. PEG CARROLL What is it you don't wanna do? 

00:55:00
[sil.] 

00:55:00
MARY ANNE  I feel like uhm, I'm trying to take over something or I'm, I'm participating too much. I'm, and I don't want to. (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:55:10
MARY ANNE You know, and I, and I, and I tend, I, I worry about one of my character defects. I think sometimes as I talk too much or I come in too much and I, yeah and I listen more yet see leap in where angels fear to tread and ah, but I wanna know you, and I guess I don't deal well with silence. 

00:55:30
DR. PEG CARROLL  Okay, let's stop right here. (laughing) Okay, now ah, if you can, anyone have a response, talk about what you think what's going on with this group, what's happening, what is the group like, what are the dynamics occurring? Gail? 

00:55:45
GAIL I'm hearing people let the other people off the hook and I'm wondering if it's because they want themselves to be off the hook. 

00:55:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay, a possibility. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
GAIL Especially around the, the area of resistance. 

00:55:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay, possibility, yeah. 

00:56:00
 I feel like they such avoid this about anger. 

00:56:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
  That's such a cognitive emotion and... (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
 ...you made a comment something to be angry is horrible... (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
  and it sure is. (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Yeah. 

00:56:10
 So nobody does it so everybody gets extra nice or extra something... (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh-huh. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
  and we never come to grips with... (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm 

00:56:15
 ..the anger but, it's not that, you, you know, there was a little bits of anger, they're leading us... (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm 

00:56:20
 ...and so everybody wants to be led so... (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm 

00:56:20
 ...nobody did it. 

00:56:20
DR. PEG CARROLL Ah, do you think, oh, did you want to say something before I? (crosstalk) 

00:56:25
ANITA Just that I felt the anger also but I, I also feel that there's a little no feelings. They all willing to go so far but then they're gonna stop... (crosstalk) 

00:56:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Okay. 

00:56:30
ANITA ...and so, I think some are modelled to lead and that they're stuck with it. 

00:56:35
DR. PEG CARROLL Any other comments or, yeah. 

00:56:40
 I, I was interested in if how the process kind of about which is Donita(ph) says, "I'm feeling ignored. I feel a little bit," everybody, everybody, Ginny, Ron," I think it was, oh, I feel so guilty then. 

00:56:50
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
 I just stick that in there. And nobody gets angry saying who, it's not our job to do it. (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
 Nobody can confronts Donita(ph) instead they, they take her verbatim... (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
DR. PEG CARROLL Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
 ...and they take and then they, they kind of ah, validate their feelings or what they didn't do... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
 ...or did do and Ron says, "It's okay, I'll change my whole style. I'll not," I mean, so then everybody has to run and Ron... (crosstalk) 

00:57:10
DR. PEG CARROLL Uh hmm. Exactly. 

00:57:10
 ...because as I'm pointing my stuff, then I just, "Your style is good, Ron." But, but they never get, I, I have to come back and there is no addressing anger. There is no feeling anger. There is no, nothing is talked about anger and so I think that the process gets convoluted into different ways that I think is really poor for the group... (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Very bad. 

00:57:30
 ...from a point of view of not making it important. (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
DR. PEG CARROLL Let it grow, let it grow.
