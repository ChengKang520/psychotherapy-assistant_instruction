KEVIN NADAL Hi, I'm Dr. Kevin Nadal, I'm an Associate Professor of Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, at the City University of New York. Today, we're going to be discussing microaggressions. Microaggressions are a brief, commonplace, everyday behaviors and statements, sometimes intentional, sometimes not. Sometimes conscious, and sometimes not. They communicate negative slights and insults towards people of various marginalized groups. Microaggressions were first described as racial microaggressions or subtle discrimination towards people of color, particularly African Americans in the 1970's, by a psychiatrist by the name of Chester Pierce (ph). In 2007, Dr. Derald Wing Sue and colleagues of Columbia University, published an article in the American Psychologist, that further discussed microaggressions that are experienced by people of color, in their everyday lives. Since that 2007 article, a breadth of literature has emerged on microaggressions towards various marginalized groups. Including microaggressions based on gender, and sexual orientation and gender identity, disability, religion and other groups as well. Today we're going to be watching a series of vignettes that described and illustrate the various types of microaggressions, uh, that people of various groups experience. I'm joined here by Dr. Nicole Watkins, a Staff Psychologist at Nashville Veterans Hospital, as well as Dr. David Rivera, an Assistant Professor of Psychology at William Patterson University. We're going to be watching various types of microaggressions based on different identities. This first set that we're going to watch, include microaggressions based on race and ethnicity. These are some of the more common microaggressions that have been described in the literature, um, that has been conducted on different groups, particularly African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans. So, let's get started and watch the videos. 

00:02:30

00:02:30
ID Please 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN All right, new brakes, new rotors, car is good as new, ready to go. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN Great, thanks, uh, can I pay by credit card? 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN No problem. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN How's it going? I'll be with you in one minute. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Okay, thanks, cool. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN That's it, sign the top please. Okay, your card, your car's right over there, thank you very much. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN Thanks. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Hi, I dropped off the green Honda, is it ready yet? 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Green Honda, ready to go for you. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Oh, cool. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN All right. Just need to see your ID please. Thank you very much. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN He didn't ask that dude in front me for his ID card. Why did he ask for mine? Is he looking at me like I'm about to commit credit card fraud? This is not how I want to start my weekend, feeling like no matter where I go, people see me as threat. 

00:03:30
[sil.] 

00:03:30
Where Are You From? 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Hey! I saw the light was on, I just thought I'd stop by. I thought I was the only one here. I guess you're getting ready for the first day, huh? 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm making sure I have my lesson plan ready before my new class of freshmen gets in. I have a minor homework assignment that I'm going to give them today. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Really, on the first day? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Wow. I guess you want to be the most hated teacher in school, huh? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN I know, I mean, that's how we started school when I was their age. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, you're right, our education began on the first day. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. Where are you from? 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Oh, my family's from Florida, um, and I've been there for the past five years, but I just moved here. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN I'm from Florida too! 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Really? Wow, um, well, where's your family from, I mean? 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Oh, both my parents are from Texas. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Oh, but, um, you're Asian, right? Uh, isn't your family from like China or Japan? 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN I'm Asian American, but both my parents aren't from China or Japan, they're from the Philippines. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Well, uh, that's okay, I gotta go. So, good luck today, okay? 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, you, you too. Both of my parents were born in Texas, my family's been here for many generations. 

00:04:45
[sil.] 

00:04:45
I Have a Ton of Hispanic Friends! 

00:04:50
WILL Hey, man how are you? 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN Pretty good, what's new? 

00:04:55
WILL No too much, I'm just trying to find a job. It's getting harder and harder to find jobs nowadays. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN And, on top of that, I have student loans, and a terrible shopping habit to support. 

00:05:05
WILL It's just getting harder to pay rent lately, you know? 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I hate the idea of getting a job at minimum wage. 

00:05:10
WILL Right. Now, we should just do what Hispanic women do, get pregnant and collect welfare. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Huh? 

00:05:15
WILL Get pregnant, collect welfare. I'm just joking around. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Well, you know that was pretty racist. 

00:05:20
WILL Oh, I'm not a racist, I'm just...I have tons of Hispanic friends. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN I have tons of Hispanic friends, how can Will be so ignorant? And, then try to rationalize such a racist remark. 

00:05:35

00:05:35
Computer Lab Closing Up 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Hey, guys, a quick announcement, the lab's closing in five minutes. So, save your work to your flash drives, and shutdown your computers, okay? 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN Uh, we're closing. Save your files and pack up. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN I know, I heard you. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Well, I don't know if you understand. I don't even know if you speak English. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Why? Because I'm Asian, I don't speak English? 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Well, you know, a lot of people in New York don't speak English. But, you didn't nod to let me know whether or not you were listening. Because I'm Asian. 

00:06:50
[sil.] 

00:06:50
KEVIN NADAL So, those were some pretty powerful clips. I think they definitely demonstrate the microaggressions that have been described a lot in the literature. 

00:07:00
NICOLE WATKINS I'd say. 

00:07:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:00
KEVIN NADAL The first scene included an African American man, who is asked for his ID when clearly the man in front of him, who's white, wasn't asked for his ID. 

00:07:05
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:10
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:07:10
KEVIN NADAL What are some of your reactions to that first scene? 

00:07:10
NICOLE WATKINS Well, I think it's important what you just pointed out, Kevin, because if you weren't thinking in the context of microaggressions, you might not even notice how subtle it was that the man asked the black man for his ID. 

00:07:20
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:07:20
NICOLE WATKINS However, if you pay it...you know and that can also be explained in a way, in a sense that, well, it's protocol, I ask everyone for ID. 

00:07:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:30
NICOLE WATKINS But, if you pay attention close enough, to the context of what's going on, you'll notice that it is the black man that's singled out. And, there is some assumptions likely being made there. 

00:07:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:40
DAVID RIVERA Yeah, I think it also speaks to the long lasting effects that microaggressions have. In the internal dialogue that we heard, he spoke about how "well, this is going to shade my weekend." 

00:07:50
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:07:50
DAVID RIVERA So, thinking about just not the, uh, the moment that a microaggression is enacted, and how that might affect somebody, but how these interactions do have long lasting effects on the lives of people who are marginalized. 

00:08:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. And, it's interesting just to think about the context, because what if that white man before him wasn't there? And so, then the black was asked for his ID, but he doesn't have anything to compare it to. Um, and so, I think that's the problem or the dilemma that microaggressions might cause, is that people start to question themselves. And, they might not be able to clearly identify something as being racially motivated, or what not, which then causes that additional stress. 

00:08:30
DAVID RIVERA Right. 

00:08:30
KEVIN NADAL What about your thoughts about the scene where, uh, the Asian American woman is asked where she's really from? 

00:08:35
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:08:35
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:08:35
KEVIN NADAL Where it's not really believed that she's from Texas? Any thoughts? 

00:08:40
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah, I mean, I think it's a common theme that's came up again and again in the studies, when we looked at the experiences of Asian Americans being treated like they're an alien in their own land, or perpetual foreigners. And, the fact is that people see a, you know, Asian phenotype and make a vast jumps about where someone's origin is from. 

00:09:00
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:09:00
NICOLE WATKINS And, the implication is that you can't be from America. 

00:09:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:00
NICOLE WATKINS Or, you're not American in some way, if you know, you're Asian American. 

00:09:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:05
DAVID RIVERA I think it also exemplifies the power dynamic inherent in these interactions. We saw the, uh, the Filipino and where she tried to explain where she was actually from, the white woman cut her off and left the room, thus maintaining that distance that is often inherent in these encounters. And, that also perpetuates to types of interactions. 

00:09:25
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think it's so meaningful when you talk about distance, because here's someone that's starting a new job, trying to relate with someone else that she's going to work with, and identifying "oh, we're from the same background, we're from the same place." But, then she says, "oh, you can't possibly be from where I'm from," people don't look like you in Florida. 

00:09:45
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:09:45
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:09:45
NICOLE WATKINS Or, people don't come from Texas and look like you. 

00:09:45
KEVIN NADAL And, that was a similar theme with the computer lab. 

00:09:50
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:09:50
KEVIN NADAL Where the woman assumes that the other Asian American woman doesn't speak English, and even gets angry when the Asian American woman confronts her. And, I think that this really speaks to, um, the clash of realities. 

00:10:05
DAVID RIVERA Yes. 

00:10:05
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:10:05
KEVIN NADAL That is often discussed in the literature, where what might be something that's common, and, um, something that person who experiences microaggressions is used to, um, is something that is a very different reality for the perpetrator of the microaggression. 

00:10:20
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:10:20
KEVIN NADAL And so, couldn't she possibly, or she couldn't possibly accept that the fact that maybe she assumed that this Asian American woman didn't speak English, because of her race. 

00:10:30
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:10:30
KEVIN NADAL Any other thoughts about that scene? 

00:10:30
NICOLE WATKINS I think it was moving, and it kind of speaks to...again, that other psychological dilemma, of Catch 22. When you confront microaggressions, often times the defenses are so strong around, "well, this isn't based on race," this is such an imbedded, automatic expectation. That people don't recognize how biased it can be. 

00:10:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:50
NICOLE WATKINS You know, it's her assuming that this person doesn't speak English, though she's in a computer lab doing work, um, just like anybody else. Just because she didn't nod her head, to acknowledge, again, kind of style of communication where it's assumed that if you're not nodding your head, not making eye contact in a very specific way, that's culturally influenced, then obviously you're doing something wrong. 

00:11:10
KEVIN NADAL And, I think that it's also helps us to see that sometimes when we do confront the microaggressor, that it can cause stress as well. So, if you do say something, perhaps the person will be defensive and it will cause you some stress, or that will make you become angry or frustrated. But, if you don't say something, what would've happened? Perhaps this Asian American woman would've thought about, uh, maybe I should've said something, maybe she would feel sad, or she might internalize that people assume her to be a perpetual foreigner, although she isn't American enough. And, we see that there's a lot of literature that describes, um, the negative impact of internalized racist on psychological wellbeing. So, I think it's important for us to realize that sometimes confronting could be helpful, but at the same time, sometimes confronting might actually cause more distress. 

00:12:00
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:12:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:12:00
KEVIN NADAL So, what about the other scene that we haven't talked about yet, the scene in which the man made a joke about Hispanic women, and then goes on to say "you know, I'm just joking, I have a ton of Hispanic friends." 

00:12:15
DAVID RIVERA I think there are a lot of dynamics embedded in this scenario. Uh, the first thing that came to my mind was the issue of immigration, or of Latinos being a drain on our society. Um, over the past 30 years polls taken on Americans, um, have suggested that Latinos are the number one group that Americans feel are a drain on our society, or that there are too many people of Latino descent immigrating into this country. And, I think that one of the stereotypes behind that is that they are coming here to be on welfare, and take advantage of American resources. Well, we know in reality that that's not true. Um, so I think that that's something that came to my mind. Also, how microaggression is often couched as a joke. 

00:13:00
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

00:13:00
DAVID RIVERA It's a way that sort of absolves the enactor of their responsibility, or of them truly espousing some kind of, uh, racist, or, uh, or derogatory kind of stance. 

00:13:15
NICOLE WATKINS Also, when you talk about it being couched as a joke too, the idea is that there's minimal harm. Because, "we're just joking, why can't you have a sense of humor about this," and it really, like you said, alleviates the responsibility around. What is the impact of saying something like that? A statement like that, that's very hurtful and likely based on the literature and what we know, in terms of national attitudes towards Latinos, Latino Americans. The reality is that's not the first time, or the last time unfortunately, that individual is going to hear some type of stereotype like that. 

00:13:45
KEVIN NADAL These are some really great thoughts, let's move on to the next set of videos, where we're going to continue to look at some microaggressions that are based on race and ethnicity. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:13:55
I am Not a Nanny! 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN He is so precious. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Thank you, I'm very lucky. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN I think he's pretty lucky too. The way you play with him is so nice. I wish I could find a nanny as nice... 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN I'm not his nanny, I'm his mother. 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN I don't...please don't be mad, It was an honest mistake. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I know. I'm so tired of people assuming that I'm Brian's nanny. People talk about being so open about race, but people can't really comprehend that family members can come in all shades. And another thing, just because I'm brown skinned, doesn't mean that I'm waiting for random women in waiting rooms to assume that I'm domestic help. 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:45
My, What Good Food you Have! 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Hey, Jess. 

00:14:50
JESS Hi. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN I'm glad you could make it. 

00:14:55
JESS Yeah, thank you for inviting me, it's a great party. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Uh, thank you. Do you want another plate, or another drink? 

00:15:00
JESS No, I mean, I'm still working on...it's really good though, that this food is from Pakistan? 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Ah, yes, it's my father's favorite dish. 

00:15:05
JESS You know, I've never had Pakistani food before, can't believe it tastes so good, it's so elegant and cosmopolitan, you know? 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Well, I'm glad you like it. 

00:15:15
JESS Of course. 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Well, that was embarrassing, what did she mean she couldn't believe it was Pakistani? Because it was cosmopolitan? Does she think Pakistani people sit around eating dirt off rocks? What a backhanded compliment. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:35
Articulate/Scmarticulate! 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Hey, Mike. 

00:15:40
MIKE Yeah? 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Come over here, I want you to meet my friend Shayla (ph). 

00:15:45
SHAYLA Hi, nice to meet you. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN He's my friend from high school. 

00:15:45
MIKE Nice to meet you, as well. 

00:15:45
SHAYLA Thanks, what brings you to the city? 

00:15:45
MIKE Well, I'm originally from a really small town, and it was insular, in fact, suffocating at times. So, I was very, very happy to move New York City. 

00:15:55
SHAYLA Wow, that's really brave of you. It's like a big jump, from small town to big city. 

00:16:00
MIKE Yeah, it's a change, a big change, but it's a really positive one. I mean, because the city is so diverse culturally, and I love the theater. In fact, I just saw Death of a Salesman, really powerful. 

00:16:10
SHAYLA Yeah, I heard that was fantastic. 

00:16:15
MIKE Mm-hmm. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Oh, wait, um, Danny's here, let me go get him. 

00:16:15
MIKE No, I'll let him in. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Okay, you know where the buzzer is? 

00:16:20
MIKE Yeah, sure. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Okay, cool. 

00:16:20
MIKE Hey, Shayla, it was really nice meeting you. 

00:16:20
SHAYLA You too. Thanks so much. 

00:16:20
MIKE Okay, take care, bye bye. 

00:16:25
SHAYLA Wow, Mike's really, really cool. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:25
SHAYLA I'm impressed with how articulate and cultured he seems. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Why, because he's black, you don't expect him to be? 

00:16:35
SHAYLA Um, I mean, um... 

00:16:40
NICOLE WATKINS So, what are your reactions to that? You're so articulate? 

00:16:45
KEVIN NADAL I mean, it's interesting because, uh, the man who was being stereotyped is not being articulated that, the African American man. He wasn't even in the room to experience it. So, sometimes it's interesting, because you might not be a member of the actual marginalized group, but it still causes some distress in you. It seemed like the other white woman, um, may have heard the stereotype, and that she may have been offended. Um, so, imagine if the African American man was in the room, and he was complimented on him being articulate? Um, that might have been another... that might have caused a different reaction, for him. And, therefore, would have lead to different types of psychological distress. 

00:17:20
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

00:17:20
DAVID RIVERA I think it also speaks to how microaggressions are maintained. 

00:17:25
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:17:25
DAVID RIVERA How they are spoken about behind closed doors, so to speak. And, there's probably a lot more that goes on, that goes unchecked, because the person may or may not be from that group. However, in this case we had an ally, and she did sort of check her friend on this belief that she thought her friend was racist. 

00:17:40
NICOLE WATKINS What do you think the metacommunication that's going on is there? 

00:17:45
KEVIN NADAL I think the stereotype is that the African American man was not expected to be articulate, and therefore, he had to be complimented on such. Um, you know people assume a lot of times that people of color are uneducated, or that they're of a lower social class. And so, when they do anything that is perceived as being outstanding, they are, uh, they receive this compliment. 

00:18:10
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:18:10
KEVIN NADAL It's very similar to, you know, telling an Asian American "oh, you speak very good English." Or, like "are you here on a scholarship?" Or, things of that nature, where they assume that you're exceptional, when in reality it's a backhanded compliment. 

00:18:25
NICOLE WATKINS You're the exception to the rule, somehow. 

00:18:25
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:18:25
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think that theme of a backhanded compliment, you can see in all of the scenarios. 

00:18:30
DAVID RIVERA Yes, right. 

00:18:30
NICOLE WATKINS So, let's talk about the woman who was complimenting the man on Pakistani food. What do you think, Kevin? 

00:18:35
KEVIN NADAL Well, I mean, I think what was interesting about it was because of the fact that the, uh, Pakistani man didn't say anything to her, she had no idea that she even microaggressed against him. 

00:18:45
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:18:45
KEVIN NADAL Um, in fact, she feels that she's just a complimentary party goer. 

00:18:50
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:18:50
KEVIN NADAL And, so I think that's the problem with microaggression sometimes. So, it's not the fault of the recipient of the microaggression that he didn't say anything, but it just goes to show that when things aren't confronted, that a person would continue this sort of behavior. 

00:19:05
NICOLE WATKINS Because it's invisible, right? So, that invisibility of the unintentional bias in some way. 

00:19:10
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
NICOLE WATKINS And, this way you get the sense that the woman in her mind might have been complimenting, well intended, but clearly that was not the message that was communicated. 

00:19:20
DAVID RIVERA It also goes back to the clash of realities. 

00:19:20
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:19:25
DAVID RIVERA And, those defining characteristics of a microaggression, where Pakistani food wasn't even in her world view of her lived experience. And, how she had...we create judgment, we create stereotypes, we create ideas and perceptions based off of what we know to be within our world view. And, then we project that onto others, which she was doing onto what her idea of what Pakistani food might be like. And, it tends to be more of a naked type of judgment that you might have, when it's outside of your world view. 

00:19:55
NICOLE WATKINS Speaking of awkward and uncomfortable judgments that were being made, let's talk about the first of this group of vignettes that we looked at, where the woman was mistaken for her child's nanny. 

00:20:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:20:05
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:20:05
DAVID RIVERA Yeah, again, this one is loaded with different characteristics of microaggressive encounters. But, when that came to me first was this assumption that she was the nanny that's tied to a lower status of a caretaker, of a service worker, that Latino's are often ascribed to be. 

00:20:20
KEVIN NADAL And, I think it also speaks to, um, microaggressions that might be based on multiracial identity. 

00:20:30
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
KEVIN NADAL And, so somebody might assume, um, that if a Latino woman is holding a lighter skinned baby, that it couldn't possibly be hers. And, I think phenotype is something that we need to to, at least, discuss a little bit. But, microaggressions that people might experience, what you look like. Um, and so, if you are a multiracial person, then somebody might mistake you as a different race, or different ethnicity, um, you might experience microaggressions that might not even match your actual heritage, or identity. 

00:20:55
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. As you identify it. 

00:21:00
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:21:00
KEVIN NADAL And, I think, especially when we hear in the internal dialogue, the idea of a transracial adoption is really common, or you think about the fact that there are many interracial families, and that families are not necessarily one shade, one racial ethnic group, one cultural background, nationality. And, how invalidating that is, to constantly receive the feedback that, "oh, clearly you don't look like a family." 

00:21:20
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:21:20
NICOLE WATKINS Or, there's something abnormal, or strange, or not expected when I see you two together. So, let's look at the next set of vignettes, which are also based on race and ethnicity. 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:35
You're Not Really Latino/a 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Hey, Joe, what are you listening to? 

00:21:40
JOE [non-English narration] 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Who sings that? 

00:21:45
JOE Celia Cruz (ph). 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Oh, I like that salsa, I just don't like to listen to salsa that much. 

00:21:50
JOE What do you like to listen to? 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN I like to listen to Adel (ph), Michael Jackson, Katy Perry, that sort of thing. 

00:21:55
JOE Damn, you don't listen to no Machata, Meringue, ( [non-English narration]), nothing like that? 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN At family parties I do. 

00:22:00
JOE I don't about you, but are you sure you're not some undercover white girl? 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN That joke is as offensive as your face. Oh, good, he's laughing, I hope he doesn't notice how embarrassed I feel. Why do people ask me things like that? Just because I like Adel and Katy Perry, doesn't mean I don't know where my family's from. Or, that I'm ashamed of being Latina. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:20
Thanks but no Thanks 

00:22:25
JAKE Hey, can I get you another drink? 

00:22:25
VANESSA Ah, no, I'm good thanks. 

00:22:30
JAKE Jake. 

00:22:30
VANESSA I'm Vanessa. 

00:22:35
JAKE How you doing Vanessa, you live around here? 

00:22:35
VANESSA Um, yeah, just a few blocks south, actually. 

00:22:35
JAKE Cuz I swear, if I saw that face, I would remember it. 

00:22:40
VANESSA Oh, okay. Yeah. 

00:22:40
JAKE You're like so exotic. I can't get over how beautiful you are. You're like all kinds of races, right? What's your mix? 

00:22:50
VANESSA Uh, um. 

00:22:50
JAKE I bet you're a tigeris (ph) in there, right? (inaudible ). 

00:22:55
VANESSA I've gotta go. Excuse me. 

00:23:00
DAVID RIVERA Well, there's a lot of reactions to this that I'm personally having. 

00:23:00
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

00:23:00
DAVID RIVERA Um, the, uh, first scenario about the intragroup microaggression, you know, this is one that's really not talked about a lot... 

00:23:10
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:23:10
DAVID RIVERA In the literature, but it's something that's really emerging. But, that struck a chord in me, um, being a light skinned Latino, I often have a lot of assumptions made about me. But, also based on where I'm from, when somebody asks that, and they find out that I'm from Wyoming. 

00:23:20
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:23:25
DAVID RIVERA I'm often given the other response of "oh, wow, there are Latino's in Wyoming?" You know, it has sort of that air of, um, people being in disbelief, not believing that people are...Latino's in Wyoming. But, other Latino's questioning even in made how Latino I am. And, this is sort of what this young woman was experiencing in this scenario, is that because of her musical taste, that maybe she isn't as Latino as the male in the scenario. 

00:23:50
NICOLE WATKINS I agree, there are a lot of reactions embedded within the scenarios that we just watch. Especially the idea that in the literature we haven't really talked about it as scholars, what within group microaggressions look like, and do they exist? Which, we know that bias is definitely communicated within group, and the expectation, especially that there's this universal experience among people of color that often we don't acknowledge at times. And, often times when we don't meet the expectations or stereotypes that we have of each other, and how internalized that can be, in terms of distancing. 

00:24:25
KEVIN NADAL I think that's definitely a great point. I think, uh, the literature has not reflected within group microaggressions. And, I think a big part of it is that I think a lot of times, people of color , or people of other marginalized groups, um, we don't want to let our dirty laundry out. 

00:24:35
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

00:24:35
KEVIN NADAL We don't want to let people know that we have problems as well. Or, that there are a lot of these different conflicts we have with each other. So, not just even within group microaggressions, but even microaggressions towards other marginalized groups. So, perhaps, Asian American's who microaggress against African American's, Latino's who microaggress against Asian American's, and so forth. 

00:24:55
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

00:24:55
KEVIN NADAL And, I think that's something that we really need to start discussing. 

00:25:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:00
KEVIN NADAL That people of color can also be microaggressors themselves. Um, and it's something that, uh, you know, we need to address. 

00:25:10
DAVID RIVERA Yes, we can take it back to one of the original defining characteristics of microaggression, and that's this class of realities that happen. 

00:25:10
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:25:15
DAVID RIVERA Because we have different world views, based on our own experiences, and, uh, I think if we don't acknowledge that, we just perpetuate this notion that, um, all Latino's are the same, or all African American's are the same, or all Asian American's are the same. When in fact, there's probably more within group difference, than there is, uh, differences across groups. 

00:25:35
KEVIN NADAL And, I think just one thing that I had a reaction to, is just anyone telling someone "you're not really 'blank' enough." 

00:25:40
DAVID RIVERA Yeah. 

00:25:40
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:25:40
KEVIN NADAL Um, here, you know it's "you're not Latino enough," but it could be basically any other group. Whether, "you're not a real gay person," or "you're not woman if you don't like this." And, I think it really goes to show how society, um, has really embedded, um, these stereotypes or assumptions, of what people are supposed to be like. It can be a real invalidating experience for people. 

00:26:05
DAVID RIVERA That's a nice segue into the next scenario, where, um, this multiracial woman is eroticized. That's one of the, um, common, um, experiences that people from multiracial backgrounds is that they are eroticized based on their physical appearance, and there are other assumptions that are made, based off of that. Such as, maybe being a tigeris (ph) in bed as the gentleman was eluding to. 

00:26:30
NICOLE WATKINS And, that really speaks to the intersections, um, all of us represent multiple cultural identities. And so, it happens on the level for her being a woman, her also be a multiracial individual. 

00:26:40
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:26:40
NICOLE WATKINS Um, we don't know her sexual orientation. There are many identities embedded within each of us, and I think microaggressions don't, we know, part of the Excite of Men (ph), about where the literature is going, looking at the idea of intersections. 

00:26:55
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:26:55
NICOLE WATKINS Because, microaggressions are not occurring based on just one of your social cultural identities, it's really across all of them, potentially. 

00:27:05
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. I think we just had a really nice, rich discussion on racial and ethnic microaggressions, and now we're going to move on to microaggressions based on gender. 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:15
Take Note 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN Okay, everyone, let's get this meeting started. Brad and Beth have prepared a presentation for us. 

00:27:25
BETH That's right boss, it's very efficient and to the point. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN Excellent. So, Brad why don't you present the information, and Beth you wouldn't mind taking notes? 

00:27:35
BETH Uh, uh, okay, sir. No problem. 

00:27:40
BRAD Uh, okay, um, let me start off with some recent data from our last sales report, for all you math enthusiasts. 

00:27:50
BETH Why was I the one to be asked to take notes? I put just as much effort into this presentation as Brad had. Did he really ask me that because I'm a woman? Could he possible still believe in those kind of traditional gender roles? Should I have said something? Should I say something to him tomorrow? 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:15
I Like Your 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Hey, Jerry, how have you been? Are you ready for the semester to begin? 

00:28:25
JERRY Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. It's been, it's been good so far. How about you? 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN I'm good, I've just been working part time at the bookstore, and taking a few classes here and there. 

00:28:30
JERRY Nice, I love your brea... shirt. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Oh, thanks. Thanks. 

00:28:35
JERRY Yeah. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN So, I'll catch you later? 

00:28:40
JERRY Okay. 

00:28:40
KEVIN NADAL So, these were our two scenes that were very interesting and focus on gender. Um, what are some of your thoughts about this? 

00:28:50
DAVID RIVERA I think that the first scene brings up the other defining characteristics, that is the Catch 22 of responding to microaggressions. Um, in the internal dialogue, we heard he question herself as to, um, where it was coming from. Her disbelief that, um, a man was still espousing these kind of genderist, uh, sexist microaggressive attitudes in today's world. But, also to how should she handle this? Should she address it tomorrow? I think that we find this a lot, especially in the workplace, in that serious ramifications can come about, if you do address it, you might be labeled as a troublemaker. 

00:29:25
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:29:25
DAVID RIVERA Or, the wave maker. 

00:29:25
KEVIN NADAL Or the feminist, or the angry minority. 

00:29:30
DAVID RIVERA Exactly. 

00:29:30
KEVIN NADAL And, I think that's the difficult piece about microaggressions in the workplace. Um, because one, they could happen all the time. Two, that, uh, that person has to interact with this potential microaggressor on a regular basis. Um, and then three, like you were mentioning, the ramifications, could this somehow impact their job, could they get fired? 

00:29:50
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:50
KEVIN NADAL And, and, um, really not have any grounds for arguing against, you know, keeping their jobs. 

00:29:55
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think it's important, the idea there's some, at least level of ambiguity about what's going on, and that's really where you find your cognitive energy being set, right? Because, even though she has a pretty clear indication in her mind that this is probably based on her gender, she was paired with someone in a partnership, and so, there's probably a way in which, if she did confront her supervisor, he could explain that away. "Well, both of you were working on this project, I asked just one of you to be point. Why do you have, you know, why are you being so sensitive? Why are you making such a big deal about it?" And, so that's really...I think it all factors into what you're saying, Dave. When you're talking about the Catch 22, is that often times with microaggressions what makes them so insidious is the idea that their sometimes a reasonable explanation, alternative to what's occurring, and it really places the recipient in the role to, you know, having to do double duty in trying to figure out how to explain what just happened to me. And, my experience and how it's negatively impacting me. 

00:31:00
DAVID RIVERA I think this also can speak to the more institutional societal level, and how these types of behaviors really maintain these glass ceilings that we see for marginalized people of the workplace. Uh, a lot has been written on, uh, glass ceilings for women. 

00:31:15
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:31:15
DAVID RIVERA And, and how these microaggressions sort of keep them at a certain level. So, even though there are laws in place to sort of protect certain statuses of people in the workplace, um, microaggressions given that they are often, sort of, tucked under the rug, or left unaddressed are really hard to prove. And, so, that does sort of...even though they're hard to prove, it maintains this sort of status quo that we're used to in terms of power positioning, and who's allowed to be at the table, and who's in command and who's not. 

00:31:50
NICOLE WATKINS And, I'm glad that you brought that up, David, because these don't occur in a vacuum. So, if you just notice visually what's going on in the room, she's the only woman that's sitting at the table. 

00:32:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:32:00
NICOLE WATKINS You know, and that also, environmentally, can be a microaggression. 

00:32:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:32:00
NICOLE WATKINS You know, so, it's not just what's being said, it's not just a one on one interaction behaviorally that's happening, it's also the greater context in which microaggressions are experienced, in a cumulative fashion. 

00:32:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I like what both of you are saying, I mean, I think we could turn to some of the literature on gender microaggressions and see that, um, this experience that this woman, um, have encountered is quite common, you know? I know that in some of the studies, there is woman who talked about "why am I always labeled as the party planner in the office?" 

00:32:30
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:32:30
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:32:30
KEVIN NADAL But, again, as you were mentioning Nicole, that the alternative hypothesis would be like "oh, no, because I just think that you are good at party planning, not because your gender." I think that's really something that's really important for us to just recognize, is that people have realities. And, earlier we were talking about interracial realities, but even different realities based on gender. What are your thoughts on the other scene, about the young man who was gazing at the woman's body? 

00:32:55
NICOLE WATKINS I think that's a tough one, especially, um, I work in a hospital setting, largely gendered based on, um, veterans. While it's a great opportunity, and I feel really connected to many of my clients and colleagues, it often times presents those awkward exchanges, where people will notice my wedding ring and will say "oh, you're married already?" And, there's this kind of subtle sexualization that's happening in the workplace, that really feels uncomfortable, and different than the experience that, at least when I speak with my male supervisors, they have when they're interacting with male clients. 

00:33:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. But, again from their perspective and their reality, they might say "oh, I ask everybody if they're married." 

00:33:35
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:33:35
KEVIN NADAL You know, or even when women are complimented on their appearance, "oh, you know I compliment everyone on their appearance." When we know that that's probably not true, or heterosexual men don't go up to other heterosexual men and say "you know, I really love your tie, it's so cute." Um, but I guess I think it really speaks to this subtle bias that, that men particularly are unaware of. That they, um, might have and how that, um, might really make women feel very uncomfortable and they might not even be aware of it. 

00:34:00
DAVID RIVERA Yeah, I think this lack of awareness comes from how rampant sexual objectification is in our society. It's hard to even walk past a newsstand and not see some image of a woman being sexually objectified. So, when you see these images so frequently, it's truly difficult not to internalize these kind of sexist attitudes that would lead one to behave in a microaggressive ways against women. As we saw this gentleman in this scenario. 

00:34:25
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think in some ways, you even...men might experience it as being helpful or being complimentary. I think about the study where they talked about women being really uncomfortable with men placing their hand on the small of their back. 

00:34:40
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:34:40
NICOLE WATKINS And, the idea from the male perspective maybe "oh, I'm helping you, I'm ushering you out of the train, or down the street," and really that's an invasion of personal space, in a way that you probably wouldn't interact with another man. And, the way of calling someone beautiful, or complimenting them, in one sense, if you take it at the superficial, surface level, you might assume that "oh, why can't that be a positive? Doesn't a woman want to be called beautiful?" But, I think really in the contexts, when it feels very inappropriate, you know very intrusive, invalidating for my role as a professional, um, it can feel quite the opposite. 

00:35:15
KEVIN NADAL I think one last thing to mention, that with gender microaggression is that a lot of people, both men and women, um, have lots of different reactions to them. 

00:35:25
NICOLE WATKINS That's true. 

00:35:25
KEVIN NADAL But, a lot of women might actually like being complimentive (ph), or they might like when a man is, um, chivalrous. And, so, that's a difficulty that I've noticed in my experiences. And so, I think, it's important for us to realize that there are some people who might have a negative reaction to things, or some people who might not mind things at all. That makes it okay, um, but it's just something that we need to recognize. 

00:35:50
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:35:50
DAVID RIVERA 

00:35:50
KEVIN NADAL So, let's move on to a video that focuses on microaggressions based on gender identity. And, what you'll notice is that in the literature there's very little written on transgender people, particularly their experiences with microaggressions. So, we hope this video helps to illustrate that. 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:10
What Do You Know About Feminism? 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN So, I've been thinking about this too, and in this video she's supposed to be portrayed as the aggressor, or the initiator. But, if the only choices are virgin or whore, is there any liberation in choosing a role? 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN She brings up an interesting question. Is the act of choosing enough to define liberation? 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Actually, I go by "he." 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yes? 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Um, I think I know what she means, um, sometimes I watch TV and, um, I see those commercials for Girls Gone Wild. And, I think just because those girls have the choice of making out with their drunk best friend, that doesn't mean they're not repressed somehow. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Hey guys, um, my pronoun is "he." 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN I agree that "he" asked an interesting question. But, my question is, what place do you even have in this discussion of controlling female sexuality, when you have chosen to even stop being a woman? 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN It's not really a choice, it's... they completely ignored me. And, when I reminded them that I'm a man, they didn't even acknowledge my gender. And, when they did it was sarcastic and mean. I felt so embarrassed, it was hard enough to have to correct them, and I've been correcting them since the beginning of the semester. Why can't they just respect my experiences? Uh, I'm so angry. I don't feel I connect with anyone at this school. 

00:37:50
NICOLE WATKINS So, let's talk about our reactions. 

00:37:50
KEVIN NADAL Well, one thing I don't like really want to admit to, but I know I've been guilty of that microaggressions myself. I've used the wrong pronouns in identifying transgender people, um, and I think, uh, when I had done that in the past, a lot of it was just because I didn't, um, know a lot about the transgender experience. And, whether it was that I was not exposed to it, or I didn't have any transgender friends at the time, um, I think that, uh, that really spoke to my ignorance. 

00:38:15
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:38:15
KEVIN NADAL So, I think that that's something that's quite common , as someone who identifies as an ally to the transgender community, um, I find myself unnoticing it all the time. Where people are always assuming what people's pronouns are, or they use the pronouns incorrectly. Um, and a lot of this people don't like, or, uh, just refuse to use the person's gender, or preferred gender pronoun. Simply because they say, "it's not correct English," or "it's grammatically incorrect," or, or "you don't match what you look like," um, so I think it can be very, very invalidating for transgender people, or non-conforming gender people in general. 

00:38:50
DAVID RIVERA I definitely agree, Kevin. And, that also leads me to think about, what I'm often asked is "well, how I, um, address when I do commit a microaggression?" And, that's something that we didn't see happening here. We saw microaggressions being continually, uh, committed against him in this scenario. Um, but, my advice to people is that you just admit when you're wrong, in the moment. 

00:39:15
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

00:39:15
DAVID RIVERA And, um, being somebody who's been microaggressed against, when somebody admits it, it actually makes me feel better. 

00:39:20
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:39:20
DAVID RIVERA Um, and that's something we don't see very often, I think sort of speaks to what we need to see more of out there. 

00:39:25
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think when you say "see more of," I'm so glad that we're having this discussion about, um, transgender and gender expression, in particular. Because, we often times, when we're talking about microaggressions are focusing on the unintentional, you know? 

00:39:40
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
NICOLE WATKINS Whether it's microinsult, or microinvalidation, but this is really a microassault. And, I think it's important to note that, because it's more overt in its nature, you know, even when he corrects them multiple times, they still feel comfortable to say "she," or to mock his identity as if he's not a stake holder at this table anymore. 

00:40:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:40:00
NICOLE WATKINS Because of his gender expression. 

00:40:05
KEVIN NADAL I'm glad you mentioned this idea of microassault, and you know, the 2007 American Psychologist article that Derald Tuite (ph) and his colleagues had written, um, they described microassaults, and microinsults, and microinvalidation. So, microassaults might mirror as more old fashioned forms of discrimination. 

00:40:20
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:40:20
KEVIN NADAL Where, it perhaps, is a lot more intentional, or conscious. Um, so maybe the people who use the incorrect gender pronouns, um, they might not have even been aware of it. But, the young woman who said "he," um, clearly, consciously wanted to convey that she didn't agree with this person's transgender identity. Or, his pronouns that he wanted to use. 

00:40:45
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:40:45
DAVID RIVERA So, this also speaks to the idea that, uh, certain types of microaggressions, or microaggressions against certain marginalized groups of people, are still sort of validated in our society. And, I think, especially when we talk about people who are transgender, or who identify in a gender non-conforming way, um, it's still quite common and endorsed in our society, that they can be, um, overtly microaggressed against. 

00:41:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I think that people are just very uncomfortable with gender non-conforming behaviors, values in general. I think, I mean, even when babies are born, um, people are really quick to, you know, make them play with trucks if they're a boy, or with dolls if they're a girl. And, I know that for me, I like sometimes I, um, will encourage the opposite of, of children in my life, um, and I get a lot of different reactions that people who might be the most social justice oriented people in the world even, um, are still very uncomfortable with gender non-conforming, um, people, as well as even behaviors. 

00:41:45
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:41:45
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. I mean, I think you're right, it starts when a baby's brought home, there's a color usually assigned. 

00:41:50
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:41:50
NICOLE WATKINS Whether it's pink, or blue, often times people make a decision very early on to say, you know, "this is the socialization process that in the binarium (ph) way," in which we usually, we narrowly think about gender, is the way in which you're conditioned, um, to behave and to be perceived by the world. 

00:42:10
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:42:10
NICOLE WATKINS So, now that we've talked about microaggressions based on gender identity, let's move on and look at the next vignettes, which focus on microaggressions involving sexual orientation. 

00:42:25

Flowers for Boyfriend 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Hello, Mellow Yellow Flower Shop, how can I help you? 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Hi, I'd like to order a bouquet of, uh, Calla Lilies, and I'm thinking maybe Tiger Lilies. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN You know, looking right now, the Calla Lilies are little pricey. But, if your girlfriend likes Calla Lilies, she'll probably love the Stargazer Lilies. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Actually, they're for my boyfriend. My band is playing a show tonight, it's really important, and he's been really supportive of me in showing up to many rehearsals and shows. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN I don't really think the bouquet's the way to go. You know, normally we have candies, and chocolates, and small gag gifts, but, um, it doesn't look like we have anything in stock right now. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN We were just discussing bouquet options, and now that I mention that I have a boyfriend, all of the sudden, you have nothing for me? 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Look, I don't have any problem with two guys being together, and, uh, if you want to order flowers for your job, you know, you need to decorate a hotel lobby, I get it. I don't get why two men would want to send flowers to each other? I mean, can't you get something like more "rough," like leather goods, or fine liqueur? 

00:43:30

00:43:30
I Love Lesbians! 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, I gotta go, I gotta go catch my train, but thanks for chatting with me, all right? 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, it was great to meet you. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Me too. You know, I'd like to take you to a movie and dinner one day. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN You know, that's really nice, but I, I don't date men. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Oh, man, you're a lesbian? I love lesbians, wah-hoo, hoo. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Lesbian, is that what you're calling it? Okay, well, all you need to know is we're not going to have dinner. 

00:44:05
UNKNOWN Oh, no. Look, I ain't trying to change you, or turn you, girl. Don't worry about that. But, listen, you ever...if you and your girl ever want to have some fun, tell you what you need to do. You need to just call me. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN That's very generous of you. What a moron, I can't believe one minute he was speaking to me like I was human being, but the second he found out that I like women, he treats me like a walking sex toy. My love life is not fodder for his sexual fantasies. I was not put on this Earth to turn him on. I feel so isolated and misunderstood.

It's not Good for our Image 

00:44:55
MARK [English song] "And I dare cross those lines (ph), when I'm right about myself. Nobody stopped before me, everybody gonna pass me by." 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN Whoo! 

00:45:15
JEREMY That's what I'm saying. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN That's what's up! 

00:45:15
MARK I guess we're going to rock tonight! 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:45:15
JEREMY You know it. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN I think it's going to be amazing. 

00:45:20
JEREMY Mm-hmm. You know it. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Okay, see you guys tonight at seven? 

00:45:20
MARK All right. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN That's what's up. 

00:45:20
JEREMY Peace. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Get it done! 

00:45:25
JEREMY Mm. Hey, Mark, um, you know I appreciate Jimmy coming to all the shows, and supporting and everything, but I was wondering if I could ask you for, like, a little favor. 

00:45:30
MARK Shoot. 

00:45:35
JEREMY Um, is there any way that you guys could be like not so, like "touchy-feely," you know what I mean? Because, you know, like a lot of the family's going to be there tonight, and I don't if it's cool for our image. 

00:45:45
MARK Hmm. It's not good for our image? I can't believe Jeremy said that. Have I been obnoxious about my relationship with Jimmy? That can't be true, Jimmy and I only hold hands at the end of a gig, and it's no more than Jeremy does with that blue haired girl that Jeremy's seeing. I shouldn't have to be ashamed of my relationships, when I hang with my friends. Well, maybe Jeremy isn't that friend that I thought he was? 

00:46:10
DAVID RIVERA So, the clips that we just saw were based on sexual orientation microaggressions, and one of the things that stood out for me, was one that has actually come out in the research. And, that's on the general discomfort that people have with people who are gay, bisexual, or lesbian. Um, and it's also an example of a microinvalidation, which is basically when, uh, one's, um, experience is nullified or invalidated, based on statements or looks, or what have you. 

00:46:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and it's just a perfect example of that was the flower shop worker, who...well, one made an assumption about the young man, even having a girlfriend in general. 

00:46:45
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:46:45
KEVIN NADAL Um, so I think a lot of times, you know, I mean; for me, as a gay man, before people get to know me, or they first meet me, they just might assume that I have a wife and kids. And, I always like to joke, that the only wife and kids I have are my parent's imagination. 

00:47:00
NICOLE WATKINS I think what both of you are saying is important in something that I've considered, as a clinical psychologist. Because, it's very important in the way I talk to clients or interview people about their experience, that I'm not invalidating, by assuming that it's a heteronormative experience by using pronouns; such as, you know, opposite sex pronouns, or making assumptions, or leaps about the fact that they're in a opposite sex relationship. 

00:47:25
DAVID RIVERA I agree. And, uh, I also thought that this was an example of, yet again, how certain groups of people that are marginalized, um, in our society, it's still okay to be sort of overt about our opinions and stereotypes, that we espouse about them. Um, the, uh, the florist in this scenario was very intrusive, in terms of taking...in terms of his invalidation of this gay man's experience. Uh, so much so, that he is recommending that he don't even buy his partner flowers. 

00:47:55
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:47:55
DAVID RIVERA Intruding on his right, too. Sort of do what he wants to do in our society. 

00:48:00
NICOLE WATKINS Because the expectation is that being gay, it's an abnormal relationship in some way. 

00:48:05
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:48:05
NICOLE WATKINS There's no romance in the way that we might traditionally associate with, you know, heterosexual relationships. And, I think similarly, when we think about the last clip that we just watched, with the band member asking the other, you know, asking his co-band member "oh, can you not hold hands with your partner." 

00:48:20
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:48:20
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:48:25
NICOLE WATKINS In public, as if, you know; this is something negative, or bad, or something that shouldn't be seen in public. 

00:48:30
KEVIN NADAL And, I think that goes along with that earlier comment that David made, about people having a general discomfort with lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. 

00:48:35
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:48:35
KEVIN NADAL Um, that in that they're so willing or open about this discomfort, whereas a lot of times with race, people might be much more subtle about it. Or, or politically correct, uh, people might, um, find no problem in expressing their discomfort, distain, towards LGB and LGT people. 

00:48:55
DAVID RIVERA What's (ph) over in this example, in essence, he's asked to go back in the closet. 

00:48:55
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:48:55
DAVID RIVERA And, just thinking about how invalidating his experience has been throughout his whole life, that even when he is out, he is, he mentioned bringing his partner to other performances, that, uh, it's okay for somebody to ask him to take a few steps back and, sort of, mellow it down some. Because, of how uncomfortable he is with people who are not heterosexual. 

00:49:20
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think also, when we switch gears to the middle clip that we watched, with the woman and the man interacting in the train station, the idea of eroticizing, or over sexualizing the LGB, um, community. It's just so rampant, the idea that this gentlemen is hitting on her. 

00:49:35
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:49:35
NICOLE WATKINS And, then, when she discloses, you know, you're not someone that I'd be interested in and partnered, or discloses her identity. Then, all of the sudden, she becomes a sexual object, instead a person sitting next to him. 

00:49:50
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:49:50
DAVID RIVERA It also speaks to the intersectionality that we've been speaking of. 

00:49:50
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:49:55
DAVID RIVERA That we've spoken about before, of gender and sexual orientation. Where, um, women tend to be exoticized more for being lesbian than gay men are, in a sexual way by straight men. 

00:50:05
KEVIN NADAL I think there's one last thing that I want to mention, that we didn't necessarily see in these clips, but it's something important for us to just keep in mind; is just this inherent systemic, and, um, institutional heterosexism that we see, and how that might then lead to some of these microaggressions, um, that we did see in these clips. 

00:50:20
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

00:50:20
KEVIN NADAL Um, I think even, just this idea of the acceptance of heterosexism, and homophobia in our society, really affects people's everyday behaviors. I mean, I think about a lot of youth that I've worked with, or even youth in my family who say things like "that's so, gay" or a new term being used, "no homo." 

00:50:40
NICOLE WATKINS "No homo," yeah. 

00:50:40
KEVIN NADAL And, it just speaks to, you know, "it's okay" to make fun of LGBT people. And, even if you're not consciously trying to insult somebody's sexual identity, or sexual orientation, um, this message is that when you say "that's so gay," that gay equals, um, weird, or bad, or not good. Um, and that really can have a negative impact on people. I mean, I think about like, uh, all the LGBT teens and adolescence who've been bullied in school, and how that has been found to lead to higher rates of suicidal ideation. Microaggressions aren't just something that we're suggesting that people think about. 

00:51:20
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:51:20
KEVIN NADAL But, what we really need to see is that they have a huge impact on people's lives. 

00:51:25
DAVID RIVERA Definitely. 

00:51:25
NICOLE WATKINS I think it's so moving what you're saying, Kevin. Because, as someone who recently got married, um, the idea of just signing up for a registry, and the fact that you see "his and hers." 

00:51:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:51:35
NICOLE WATKINS You know, echo throughout. And, I know there's been some movement to see "hers and hers," and "his and his." Which, I think is important in moving in the right direction, but it's still an outlier, more than it's common. And, it's the idea that this isn't even something that people consider in their everyday vernacular. 

00:51:50
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:51:50
NICOLE WATKINS How they invalidation an experience of a whole group of people. And, the implications are huge. 

00:51:55
DAVID RIVERA I think that our conversation on sexual orientation microaggressions was so rich, but let's now move onto another class of microaggressions. One that's really not spoke about as much, and that's based on a disability. 

00:52:10
[sil.] 

00:52:10
So Lazy 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Excuse me. 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Wow. Some people are just lazy. I can't believe she requested the elevator for one floor. That must drive you crazy? 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Did he just say what I think he said? Is that his version of small talk? I feel the sight of me, makes him uncomfortable, that he had to bring my disability. Why does he assume I can't take the stairs? He doesn't know me. 

00:53:05

00:53:05
Academic Advisor Appointment 

00:53:15
ROBIN Hi, my name's Robin, I'm here for a 2:30 appointment with Dr. Vasquez. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Okay, have a seat, and she'll be with you in a moment. 

00:53:20
ROBIN All right. Thanks, so much. Is there anybody sitting here? 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN No, there isn't. 

00:53:25
ROBIN Okay, thank you. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Robin? 

00:53:30
ROBIN Here. 

00:53:30
DR. VASQUEZ Hi, Robin. Don't get up. 

00:53:30
ROBIN Oh, okay. Thanks. 

00:53:35
DR. VASQUEZ I'm Dr. Vasquez 

00:53:35
ROBIN Okay, nice to meet you. 

00:53:35
DR. VASQUEZ There's a counter here. 

00:53:35
ROBIN Oh, oh, I know. 

00:53:40
DR. VASQUEZ My office is over here. 

00:53:45
KEVIN NADAL So, these two clips just really focused on just two types of, of examples of microaggressions that are experienced by people with disabilities. Um, and I think it's really important to recognize that we had just two different types of disabilities. So, somebody who was blind, and somebody, um, who might have been more physically disabled. Um, so, what are your thoughts about this? 

00:54:05
NICOLE WATKINS I think it really does speak to the invisibility of bias, once again. Because, if you look at, you know, on the surface, both of the individuals in both clips were trying to be helpful. Or, trying to do something that's seemingly might have been joining with these individuals. But, it was far from it. So, we think about the woman who was going to see her academic advisor, there's really an invasion of personal space that happens when you reach out and touch someone. 

00:54:30
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

00:54:30
NICOLE WATKINS I don't know that happens to me commonly, as an able bodied person. That someone is able to reach out and touch me automatically, without invitation. I think it's very important to note how microaggressive that type of behavior can be. 

00:54:45
KEVIN NADAL And, it's so invalidating, intrusive, like you had mentioned. Um, again, that person is well intentioned. They think that they're being helpful, and I think a lot of times, um, it might really speak to, uh, the person's bias towards people with disabilities. 

00:55:00
NICOLE WATKINS Well, you're assuming they're helpless, right? 

00:55:00
KEVIN NADAL That they're helpless, they can't do anything, that they need to be saved. 

00:55:05
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:55:05
KEVIN NADAL And, all these other very negative stereotypes that they might have. 

00:55:05
DAVID RIVERA It also makes me think of this theme that came out in the research that's been done on ability, and that is what they called the "spread effect." 

00:55:15
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:55:15
DAVID RIVERA And, it's where...uh, when somebody is identified as having some kind of disability, be it physical or, uh, intellectual that is assumed that they have other types of disabilities, as well. So, that may have been what was going on with this woman who couldn't see, or was visually impaired, is that it was assumed that she had mobility issues, as well. Or, she needed to be walked around. 

00:55:40
KEVIN NADAL Or, cognitive issues. 

00:55:40
DAVID RIVERA Or, cognitive issues. So, there's a number of other assumptions that go into the microaggressive encounter, above and beyond, uh, what the actual individual is dealing with, in terms of their ability issues. 

00:55:50
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:55:50
KEVIN NADAL I mean, so, now let's talk about that other clip, where there's a woman with a physical disability. She may not be that noticeable to some folks, and I think that's important for us to realize, is that some disabilities might be much more visible. And, some people might have more invisible disabilities. And, sometimes people have disabilities that are somewhere in between. 

00:56:10
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:56:10
KEVIN NADAL Where some people might notice them, some people might not. 

00:56:10
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:56:10
KEVIN NADAL Um, so, she's walking with a limp, so, therefore, this man feels that this other woman , able bodied woman, who enters the elevator, uh, is lazy. And, he wants to, as you had mentioned, join with her. 

00:56:25
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:56:25
KEVIN NADAL But, in reality, it, it feels very invalidating. 

00:56:30
NICOLE WATKINS Because, there's assumptions, right? Like she says in her internal dialogue, she talks about the idea that you assume that "I feel some type of distain for this other person." And, we assume also, that the other person was able bodied, when in fact, we don't know what was going on with that person, that they needed to take the stairs. Or, preferred to take the stairs. 

00:56:50
DAVID RIVERA Yeah, the assumption of able-bodiedness sort of goes across different types of scenarios. 

00:56:55
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:56:55
DAVID RIVERA So, I think that, um, I've often seen this in parking lots, when people have complained about why are there so many parking lots for somebody with a disability. Then, they see somebody get out of the car, and they're not in a wheelchair or on crutches, it's assumed that they're disability may not be as severe to them to warrant that kind of, uh, courtesy really. So, that they can, sort of, have an easier access the store, or wherever they're going to. I think that the underlying, uh, assumption of shared type is that the person is lazy. And, that, uh, again, that they are taking advantage of resources. That there's some kind of unfairness issue involved there, uh, by the person who is perpetrator of this type of interaction. 

00:57:30
NICOLE WATKINS I think it also brings up the idea of access, and who has access to certain spaces. And, the fact that, you know, a lot of spaces are not necessarily, um...I think there's been a movement, but a lot of spaces still are not accessible for all types of people, given their ability status. And, so, you know, whether there's a ramp, or there's places to take breaks when you're walking; those are things that are important too, and I think people who are able-bodied might take for granted. 

00:58:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. I'm glad you mentioned that, because I think that able-bodied people and people who have any sort of power privilege, are just completely oblivious unto all these things. You know, a lot of times people wouldn't even think twice about walking into a building, and noticing whether or not there was a ramp, or an elevator, or something that would be, um, more accessible. So, I think that's something important for all of us to realize, is that, um, for the privileged groups that we belong to, what are some of those spots that we can't see. 

00:58:30
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

00:58:30
KEVIN NADAL What are some those, um, areas that, that we don't recognize that we have so much privilege, that we take for granted on an everyday basis. 

00:58:35
DAVID RIVERA So, something that I wanted to bring up that has to do with ability issues, is the fact that it's only been a little over 20 years that the American With Disabilities Act, uh, was passed, and where protections have been in place for people with disabilities. And, so, it's a rather new protection that, um, this class of individuals has. And, that there are so many barriers out there, that we've been speaking about, whether it be an access to buildings or resources; or whether it just be getting around. But, also, we should think about those, those disabilities that aren't a physical manifestation, but more intellectual or emotional. 

00:59:15
NICOLE WATKINS That's right. 

00:59:15
DAVID RIVERA And, those things often go dismissed more frequently, because they're unseen. 

00:59:15
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

00:59:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, this is a great discussion, let's move on and talk about microaggressions based on religion. 

00:59:25

00:59:25
No Offense, But I'm Not Muslim 

00:59:25
PROFESSOR WATKINS Welcome to Foundations of Counseling. My name is Professor Watkins, I'll be your instructor for the semester. What I'd like to do, is have everyone introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about who you are. Let's being with you sir. 

00:59:45
ANDREW Hi, I'm Andrew Ramirez, I am originally from California and this is my second semester in this program. 

00:59:55
LAUREN Hi, I'm Lauren Richardson and I'm from Boston. This is my first counseling course, and I'm really excited to be here. 

01:00:00
ABHID My name is Abhid Hussein (ph), I was born and raised in Colorado, and I too, am looking forward to taking this class. 

01:00:05
MIRIAM Hi everyone, my name is Miriam Ali, and I'm from here in New York. Oh, even though my last name is Ali, I'm not a Muslim. No offense to you, but I always get asked if I'm Muslim. 

01:00:20
ABHID It's okay. 

01:00:20
MIRIAM Ah. 

01:00:20
ABHID How does she even know that I was a Muslim? I didn't tell anyone. She said it as if it was a bad thing to be a Muslim. I expected so much more from this class.

01:00:35
Can't Wait for Christmas Break 

01:00:45
UNKNOWN Sam, I can't wait for Christmas break. The only thing I can think of is seeing my family and eating ham. You know, our family's sort of like the Easter, Christmas type of Christians, but that counts. 

01:00:55
SAM Mm-hmm. 

01:00:55
UNKNOWN What's your favorite Christmas dish? 

01:00:55
SAM Well, being that I'm Jewish and Kosher, it's definitely not ham. 

01:01:00
UNKNOWN Oh wait, you're Jewish? 

01:01:05
NICOLE WATKINS So, what are you reactions? What do you think? 

01:01:05
KEVIN NADAL I think the first thing that comes to mind, is this idea, um, that people are automatically assumed to be Christian. Um, in that scenario where the Jewish man is asked, you know, what his favorite Christmas dish was? Maybe it really exemplifies this assumption that people have. I mean, even if you just walk around any store across America, as early as October sometimes, they have Christmas decorations everywhere, Christmas music playing everywhere. And, it's such an environmental microaggression that people can experience. Um, when people wish somebody Merry Christmas. 

01:01:40
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

01:01:40
KEVIN NADAL Um, again, and, uh, intending to, to be, cheerful. 

01:01:45
NICOLE WATKINS Cheerful. 

01:01:45
KEVIN NADAL And, you know, make a connection. 

01:01:45
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:01:45
KEVIN NADAL When, in reality, if you aren't Christian, um, even a different religious group, or even non-religious at all; that might communicate "oh, you're wrong, you're different, you're religion isn't good enough," or not having a religion means something, as well. 

01:02:00
DAVID RIVERA Exactly. 

01:02:05
NICOLE WATKINS It's this perceived universality of Christmas, the holiday. And, that there's something inherently cheerful. I remember, just this past year, you know, starting at a new position and people wanted to do a secret Santa. You know, and I felt really torn, because as an ally, even though I identify as Christian, I felt like it was important to speak up and say "maybe we can do a gift exchange, if that seems like something everyone wants to get onboard with." But, do we necessarily have to refer to it as secret Santa? And, there was some pushback. 

01:02:30
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

01:02:30
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:02:30
NICOLE WATKINS You know, I kind of felt like the Grinch That Stole Christmas. 

01:02:35
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:02:35
NICOLE WATKINS You know? The idea is, you know, all different types of expressions of religious background should be celebrated and embraced. But, like you're saying, on a environmental level, they're really not. 

01:02:45
DAVID RIVERA You know, it's so institutionalized in our country, we get Christian holidays off, in general. In New York, we get some Jewish holidays off, as well. But, that's not typical of everywhere that you go. 

01:02:55
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

01:02:55
DAVID RIVERA And, we have people of different faith's living in every city and every state in this country. Uh, so I think that, again, it goes back to what are the messages that the federal government sends, what are the messages that different institutions send? And, how these do really maintain these microaggressive encounters. 

01:03:10
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

01:03:10
KEVIN NADAL And, let's just imagine, like what is it like to be a person who doesn't identify as Christian, um, to hear these things, um, all the time, and for it to be just so commonplace. I mean, I know, as I identify as an agnostic person, um, and I know that anytime somebody says "God bless you," or, you know again, "Merry Christmas," um, there is that assumption that you would be, uh, religious. And, what are the messages that are sent; um, or some of the messages that I've received in telling people that I'm agnostic, is that somehow I'm evil. 

01:03:40
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

01:03:40
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:03:40
KEVIN NADAL Or, for not believing in Christianity, or having a religion that I prescribe to. Um, I think that can have a real psychological toll on somebody, if you hear these sorts of things over and over again. 

01:03:55
DAVID RIVERA Well, Kevin, this makes me think of the other scenario, where this young woman is distancing herself from Muslim's, because of how she's been mistakenly identified in the past. Uh, you mentioned, um, some of the negative stereotypes or, or that you've received based on your identity as being agnostic. And, um, I think that anything that goes out of the realm of being Christian for the most part, there are a lot of negative associations with that. Um, I think there always have been those negative associations for non-Christians in our country, but, uh, post 9-11 I think that was really heightened. Uh, I think it was hard to deny that it was heightened by that, um, by that event. And, how there was a real distancing from being Muslim. 

01:04:35
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. I think you're right, especially there's multiple layers in what happened in the clip. I think about the idea that, not only did she have to put a billboard out, you know, that said "wait, I'm not Muslim," she also looked to one of her fellow classmates to say "no offense." So, there's multiple offenses that are actually occurring there. 

01:05:00
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

01:05:00
NICOLE WATKINS The idea that you have to distance yourself, that there's something, metacommunication that there's something bad, or there's something wrong, or I would not want to be identified in that way. Even though it's not being brought up. And, the idea that you can judge just by looking at someone, what their religious orientation would be. 

01:05:15
DAVID RIVERA Right, in fact, she was doing what is often done to her. 

01:05:15
NICOLE WATKINS Right. 

01:05:15
DAVID RIVERA Without ever even really acknowledging that she was committing the same kind of microaggression, or assumption that she's felt so many times. 

01:05:25
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. Let's move onto our final set of clips, which look at microaggressions based on intersectionality. 

01:05:35
[sil.] 

01:05:35
Why They Gotta Be So Loud! 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN So, how long does this present have to be? 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN I think the professor said 20 minutes. 

01:05:45
LENA Okay. So, that means that we have to talk for four minutes. 

01:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:05:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:05:50
UNKNOWN Why do they have to be so loud? You know, I could never date a woman like that, you know? I like nice quiet ladies, like you Lena. 

01:06:00
UNKNOWN Well, Lena isn't all ghetto like the girls at that table. I can't wait to see what that presentation is like. 

01:06:10
LENA It's as if I was supposed to be the ambassador for every black woman on Earth. I was supposed to be able to account for the decibel levels of strangers at the next table. And, I was supposed to be grateful that they deemed me civilized enough to work on their group project. Ugh! 

01:06:30
[sil.] 

01:06:30
Baby Talk 

01:06:40
UNKNOWN You know, that is so great that you want to be father's. I mean, I've know you both for so long, I'm sure that it's going to go really well. 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN Thanks, I think we're both really excited. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN You guys are going to have kids? 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, we've finally decided that we're finally ready to adopt. 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Wow. 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN Really, you guys are adopting? I mean, I hope you're ready, and you've done your homework. It's going to be difficult without a mother figure. Have you looked into parenting class, or taken out books? 

01:07:00
UNKNOWN Plenty of women don't have a mother intuition. I think parenting is difficult, no matter what. 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN I guess. 

01:07:10
UNKNOWN Well, you know, I've known Jimmy since he was eight, and I'm sure he's going to be a great dad. So, what are you thinking, of maybe adopting a mixed child, so it looks like both of you? Or? 

01:07:20
JIMMY Nah, we just want a health child. 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN Well, you know, this two daddy thing's going to be hard enough for your kid to get, might as well make the race thing a little easier to handle. 

01:07:35
DAVID RIVERA So, in both of these scenarios, we were able to see microaggressions based on intersecting identities. There's some intersections based on race, gender, sexual orientation, for example. So, what are some of your thoughts on this? 

01:07:45
KEVIN NADAL Well, I know that with the clip involving, um, the black women and the white man making the statement of "why do they gotta be so loud," um, I think that really is an intersection of both their race and their gender. Um, or their...he's making an assumption of, of all black women as being loud, and perhaps even stereotyping them as being uneducated. There were some comments about what kind of presentation they were going to have. Um, and so I think we need to realize this, um, what Nicole you had mentioned earlier, that it's not just on one identity that you're being microaggressed, that most of time it has to do with more than one thing. Perhaps, there might be one identity that might be, um, more present, or, or more noticeable. Um, but, it's the intersections that's, um, being, uh, microaggressed against. 

01:08:30
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:08:30
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think it's interesting that in that clip, the recipient of the microaggressive experience was really the black group member who was participating. And, the expectation, in some ways, that she's the exception to the rule, or that she's a spokeswoman, like "why are they loud?" It's almost a question as if she's supposed to answer that in some way. 

01:08:50
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

01:08:50
NICOLE WATKINS And, then, it was further, I thought, microaggressive for sure the idea of "well, I would date someone like you." Implying that that's a privilege for her, to be looked at affirming by a white male. 

01:09:05
DAVID RIVERA Yeah, exactly, we saw how her cultural values, or the communication styles of African American's was pathologized (ph) in this video. And, not just that, but that it was taken to the extent that based on how they were communicating with each other was an indication of their intellectual ability. So, the subscription of intelligence that find African American's are often described to be of lower intelligence. You know, the group member made the comment "well, it will be interesting to see how that presentation goes." 

01:09:30
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

01:09:30
DAVID RIVERA Sort of indicating that it's probably not going to be as of high quality as theirs, just because of the way that they were interacting with one another. So, what do you think about that other scenario involving the interracial gay couple? 

01:09:40
KEVIN NADAL Well, I definitely think it speaks to intersectionalities, I mean, you know they are interracial, so, there's the race issue coming out. The fact that they're gay men, on some of the comments that some of their friends or acquaintances made, um, about two gay men raising a child. So, you know, that is based on gender. 

01:09:55
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:09:55
KEVIN NADAL Um, so, there's just a lot of going on. You know, I think, um, in this scenario, it really, uh, describes those microinsults. Um, you know, we've described the microassaults, and the microinvalidations. But, the microinsults, so, they're making these blanket statements about men raising babies, and then these blanket statements about whether this child is going to be confused, or, or have a difficult time in life because they are being raised by two dads. I mean, that can be really insulting, you know? So, microinsults being these statements, or behaviors that communicate distain, or disgust, or biased. 

01:10:30
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:10:30
KEVIN NADAL And, so, I think that is definitely something that stood out, to me. 

01:10:35
NICOLE WATKINS I think it really does, Kevin. And, in fact it really harkens (ph) back to the earlier clip we watched with the nanny, um, example where, you know, the idea that a family looks a certain way. And, that in some way this child is going to be an abnormal, or not well settled environment because of the fact that, um, that it's two dads. Um, it has two dads, or the fact that it has interracial family, um, roots. And, it's really insulting. 

01:11:00
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

01:11:00
NICOLE WATKINS You know, this idea that it can't be a happy, health home, and that there's something inherent to watch out for. 

01:11:05
DAVID RIVERA And, it also speaks to this hierarchy of oppressions, that was sort of alluded to by the woman who said "well, they're going to have enough to deal with by two gay dads, so why don't you have a child that at least looks like you?" And, what does that communicate, that it's worse to be gay, or it's worse to be multiracial? You know, there's a lot embedded in that, as well. 

01:11:25
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think something that we've saw throughout the clips, is that idea that the perpetrator of microaggressions can be means of, you know, relation or closeness. So, in this instance, this is a childhood friend, you know? 

01:11:35
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:11:35
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think often times, that can happen where it's a friend, or where it's someone you are close to, whether it's a family member. And, it can make it even more difficult to confront, because there's this mixed feeling of "this is someone I'm close to, this is someone that I trust." But, yet, there's this very microaggressive experience that I'm having. 

01:11:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and I think you're right. I think there's definitely demonstrated microaggressions, um, that can happen in more of a friendly environment, that we've seen throughout this entire video. Um, microaggressions that might happen in the workplace, with strangers and so forth. 

01:12:10
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

01:12:10
KEVIN NADAL And, I think that's just as important for us to see. And, I hope that the video helped to convey microaggressions in all contexts. 

01:12:15
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:12:15
KEVIN NADAL Or, at least a good sample of various contexts. 

01:12:20
Closing Remarks 

01:12:20
KEVIN NADAL Do you all have any thoughts about just the video, in general? Or, the videos that we had seen? And, just other things that you might think would be important for us to add? 

01:12:30
DAVID RIVERA I think that given the breadth of microaggressive encounters that were demonstrated throughout the video, that it's important for people to take home the message that microaggressions are, uh, very nuanced. That, what we spoke what, uh, we viewed in the videos is just a subset of experiences that marginalized people, um, have to go through in their daily lives. And, that there are other marginalized groups that weren't even included in these groups. And, so, it sort of taken this idea, this phenomenon of microaggression, and thinking about it in a more nuanced way, by thinking about how we come across as, as people. The type of, um, ideals that that we espouse, and how those can be communicated in a microaggressive way. So, I think for me, that's really what stood out in today's conversation. 

01:13:20
NICOLE WATKINS Part of it is sitting here, with how heavy those experiences are. And, especially for people who are looking at increasing awareness, um, and understanding more about this phenomenon, it really sits with you. 

01:13:30
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

01:13:30
NICOLE WATKINS And, I think that's part of what you notice in my silence, is just really taking it in, the enormity of how often, how common, um, how frequent. You know, microaggressions occur, they're not addressed, um, and thinking as my role, you know, what part do I play in this? Um, and hoping that this is just a discussion. A part of the discussion that gets continued beyond what we're sitting here talking about today. And, I know that there's a lot of exciting research that's being done, and there are classroom discussions, and hopefully workplace discussions that are starting to occur. 

01:14:05
KEVIN NADAL Mm-hmm. 

01:14:05
NICOLE WATKINS About microaggressions. But, I have to agree with both of you. You know, it's still very nuanced, there's still so much for us to know and understand about how we can really do something different, um, to continue to combat microaggressions. So, they're not occurring as often, as frequent, and so that we really see less disparities, and more change. 

01:14:25
DAVID RIVERA Yeah. 

01:14:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that the research and the disparities as well, because there has been this increase in research that's found that microaggressions have a negative influence on things like mental health, and depression, and self-esteem, as well as even physical health. 

01:14:40
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

01:14:40
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:14:40
KEVIN NADAL That there have been some studies that find that people who experience more microaggressions, might exhibit more physical health symptoms. And, I think, again, that what I mentioned before, it's not just that we think it's important for us to just recognize that microaggressions exist, but we also need to realize that they do have a detrimental impact on people's lives. 

01:15:00
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:15:00
KEVIN NADAL And, when people's physical health, and their mental health are at stake, um, I think it becomes a more serious issue that we need to address. 

01:15:05
DAVID RIVERA Yes. 

01:15:05
KEVIN NADAL You know, I also think what was interesting was the fact that they...we used these actors and they had these multiple roles, and it just got me to realize that, um, people can be both the perpetrator and the (inaudible ). 

01:15:18
NICOLE WATKINS Yeah. 

01:15:18
KEVIN NADAL Or, uh, or recipients of microaggression at any time. 

01:15:20
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:15:20
KEVIN NADAL In some instances, they might have powerful, or privileged identities. Other instances, they may be more marginalized, and so we need to realize that not everybody, um, is a perpetrator because you're white, or because you're a man, you're always going to be a perpetrator. Perhaps, you have another he might have another identity in which he might be the recipient of these microaggressions, as well. 

01:15:35
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:15:35
NICOLE WATKINS Mm-hmm. 

01:15:35
KEVIN NADAL And, so, it's really important for us to, to, uh, to, for us to acknowledge both of power, our privileged and powerful identities, as well as our marginalized identities. I guess the last thing I just want to mention is just this; what are some of these implications for psychology? Um, you know, we as clinicians, or as researchers, or as educators need to realize that, um, you know, our clients and our students experience microaggressions. Whether it's, um, in their everyday lives, or perhaps even in therapy sessions, in the classrooms, um, we need to, um, model effective ways of coping with microaggressions, acknowledging microaggressions. Um, we need to, um, really allow our clients and our students to feel validated when they experience microaggressions. Um, I think what we're finding, is a lot of times, that microaggressions go unnoticed. 

01:16:25
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:16:25
KEVIN NADAL But, hopefully, a video like this, and on the other sorts of trainings, um, that people might take, or become involved in, that this might help people to, to at least start that dialogue of what, um, of how we can combat these microaggressions. To, to help eliminate some of these disparities and psychological hardships that many people experience. 

01:16:50
DAVID RIVERA Mm-hmm. 

01:16:50
KEVIN NADAL So, thank you so much for being a part of this video. It was a pleasure having this discussion with you, and I hope that everybody enjoyed everything that we had to talk about today, and that you continue to further these discussions in your classroom settings, in your family and friendships and in other aspects of your lives. Thank you very much.
