ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Mindfulness within the mental health field is so important because it not only can significantly help clients in their own recovery. It can also help your growth and development, as a person and as a professional. Mindfulness has been around for centuries in other terms, mostly in – what we now call Asia. And it’s something that really has transformed the lives of countless people over literally thousands of years. But, in America, mindfulness based mental health practices, professionally, have really only been mainstream for about 30 years or so. And really have only been actively incorporated into specific mental health treatment approaches for about 15 to 20 years. The reason why we need to understand and incorporate mindfulness into our work with clients is because we all have to admit life is becoming more and more complicated. Tweeting, texting, emailing, skyping, blogging, gaming, it’s almost impossible to unplug nowadays. This leads to so much stimulation that frankly our brains are not hardwired to accept and to deal with on a day to day basis. In addition to that, society is becoming much more competitive. Relationships, jobs, other areas, these are stressful in our day to day lives. And what ends up happening is, it makes us go through life on automatic pilot. Have you ever felt like you were just trying to get through the day. Almost all of us have. And what the result is, is mindlessness. Not being in touch with who we are, with how we live and especially with the power of our mind. This is where mindfulness based approaches come into play, in mental health treatment. There are actually empirically validated approaches that are based on mindfulness. I’ll name a few. One, mindfulness based cognitive therapy. Another mindfulness based stress reduction. A third acceptance and commitment therapy or ACT. And dialectical behavior therapy or DBT. These four approaches are becoming much more widely accepted in the mental health field. But what I’ve noticed is that when people learn about these approaches and try to use them, they often really don’t understand what is beneath them. Where do they come from. What is the wellspring that really drives these approaches and makes them so successful with clients. Well, where they come from is eastern psychology. And so, to make these approaches really useful and to understand them as a clinician and not just do them on clients, it’s important for you to know the heart and the soul of what leads to mindfulness. And this is a perspective. This is how you literally see people and mental health. So, an example of this is that, in western society we tend to see things events, research, even client issues as linear separate things that we break apart and categorize in some discrete way and somehow think that one doesn’t relate to the other. And then we try to find a very again, linear specific, rational type of process toward the treatment approach. Perfect example of this is rational motor behavior therapy. Which follows the A, B, C, D, E model of treatment. It’s hard to be more linear than that. Most cognitive and or behavioral approaches are very categorical and linear in that kind of a way. The problem is that life is not as linear. Life is really a circular process. Of things coming and going. In patterns and waves and somehow even disconnected parts. But they all are interrelated and interdependent with one another. And they all form a whole. Now excellence, social-psychological research, Richard Nisbet talked about that in a fascinating book called, The Geography of Thought. And he explains over decades of social-psychology research how Asian and westerns literally see the world differently. And that affects how you perceive others, how you respond to events. And ultimately I believe, how we conceptualize mental health, and treatment. The reason why I love mindfulness and why I think it’s so effective is because due to the holistic and interrelated and continuous nature of this approach to understanding the world, which is the reality of how we live, it lends itself to a homeopathic treatment approach. Very different from typical western health care. Which is considered allopathic, or prescriptive. Diagnosing a symptom of illness and then trying to simply correct that usually by introducing the opposite. For example, in cognitive therapy, irrational beliefs are substituted with rational ones. In behavioral therapy, an unwanted behavior is punished or extinguished and substituted or reinforced for another one. In homeopathic treatment, which very much relates to mindfulness based approaches, we’re actually using the whole person. And their resources and strengths from the inside out to understand themselves and then to heal themselves. In my opinion, one of the goals of therapy is clients having more conscious influence over their own life. And one of the best ways to do that is through mindfulness. Because after all, what is the one thing that every single client will have that walks into your door, a mind. The more we can access the power of mindfulness, being full of mind, and using that, the more likely we could lead clients towards recovery. This is even described in different symbols that we use in society. This literally is another way to help understand how people in different cultures view the world. For example, in American culture what our common symbols. If you were think of the first image that comes to your mind that defines America, what would it be. For most people, it’s the Statue of Liberty. Independence, being autonomous. The Empire State Building, another example, tallest building in the world at the time. A marvel of size and structure and – and being number one. Being independent. The eagle, flying high alone. A symbol of power. This is very different than typical eastern symbols that define how they see the world. For example, the yin and yang symbol. Two energies, one transforming into the opposite. Both interrelated and interdependent. Or, a green circle, with an opening at the top called enso. Japanese for circle. This signifies the concrete and the infinite. It always opens up into the world because nothing is ever enclosed in and of itself. Another image, the mandala, the wheel of life. Moving towards understanding suffering until you reach the core of enlightenment or nirvana. And a symbol of Confucianism. To me it always looks like two people holding hands. But what it actually signifies is harmony, balance and life. These are things that are common threads in eastern psychology. And it’s a very different way of understanding people, and mental health. What it really shows us and what mindfulness is based on is that life is a state of mind. We all have to deal with suffering in our life. From the suffering of birth to illness to old age and even death. But pain is different than suffering. Pain in Buddhism is described as unavoidable. Suffering is optional. Because suffering is a state of mind. The more we understand mind, through mindfulness, the more we can work on our own to reduce and even eliminate suffering. This comes through awareness of mind. Acceptance of mind and the importance of mindfulness in mental health. Mindfulness is literally awareness of paying purposeful attention in the moment, non-judgmentally. Just to things as they are. It’s a beautiful statement and a freeing on to just be in the moment, experience what you’re experiencing and just allowing yourself to be. It’s not easy. But it’s something that really vital if we’re going to move towards full awareness and mental health and more conscious influence over our own life. The hard part about this, especially in our culture is that in order to do that, in order to understand and really practice mindfulness, we first have to unknow. This is not just a cognitive thing learning what mindfulness is in terms of knowledge. We have to become mindful. To do that we might have to un-know what we have learned to this point. And start listening to ourselves. One way to do that is simply to become calm and present by breathing. If you were to just breath in through your nose, practice is right now. Breath in your through nose to the count of three and bring – breath out through your mouth to the count of six. In through the nose, to the count of three. And our through the mouth to the count of six. Allowing your diaphragm to expand. The upper part of your stomach. What that literally does is it exercises the diaphragm. It also infuses your whole body with vital nutrient producing oxygen. It also cools the hypothalamus in your brain. And elicits what’s called the parasympathetic nervous system. The rest and rejuvenate part of your body. Simple exercise that only takes a couple minutes. People could do it any time in order to become centered and more present and then it ignites a sense of mindfulness and actually makes you want more of that. It’s a positive spiral that could help you in your life. Help you listen to what’s going on in your body. And that will let you become free to be open and available to whatever you’re experiencing in that moment. That leads to much more acceptance of what’s going on inside of you in your brain and your body. Which is mind. More you can accept your mind in the present non-judgmentally, the more you’ll be able to transform it on your own. And isn’t that the ultimate goal of mental health. Conscious influence over your own life through transforming your state of mind. Powerful and very, very doable. The rub is, practitioners need to learn how to do it themselves. This is not simply a teachable moment to clients. In order to help clients become mindful you must become mindful yourself. This is something that should be practiced every day because anything you touch becomes part of you. The more you touch your own mind, the more you accept it, the more you start to be with it, the more mindful you will naturally become. And you can model that for clients it will lead directly to their own recovery and to your own growth and development as a clinician. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER Thank you for your talk on mindfulness. Um, we worked briefly at the same university and so I – I know you a little bit. And I know how mindful you are. In fact, I think they had to twist your arm, like a few weeks ago, just for you to get cell phone. It -- 

00:17:20
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ That’s true. 

00:17:20
SHANNON DERMER You don’t like a lot of that – although you use technology, you mention that. It gets in the way of people being mindful and being connected. 

00:17:25
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. It’s ironic. Because in a way we’re much more connected to so many people, to so many things, to so much stimuli in our life. But we’re not really in touch. It’s almost a disconnected connection. And what ends up happening is, the people nowadays they are feeling lonelier than ever. They’re feeling out of touch with who they are a sense of purpose in life, a sense of belonging with others. Some of the key things that make us happy. And so, there’s almost a zero sum game between happiness and suffering. And unfortunately, because of the technologized competitive, um, momentum of our society, people are often in touch with things that could lead to more suffering without their awareness. 

00:18:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:18:30
SHANNON DERMER Now how are you able to balance that. And how would you suggest other people balance it. Because, I mean, face it, in the United States and in the western world and really globally now, we need technology in some ways to stay up to date, um, for our jobs. Like I know you’re well versed in technology, yet you’re able to leave it without the anxiety that some people have when they leave behind their technology. So how would you coach people to balance that, the technology with the mindfulness. 

00:19:00
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:19:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ It’s a – it’s a good question because it’s something that we have to face every single day. All of us do. And the good news about mindfulness is that it can be practiced anywhere. When most people think about mindfulness the first thing that comes to their mind is meditation. Meditation is one method towards cultivating mindfulness. But it’s not even close to the only one. You can practice mindfulness when you eat. By actually being present and eating. By tasting your food. By feeling it in your body. By being aware of your motions. It’s a matter of presence in the moment. Even with technology, if you were actually there and focused you could really have higher quality of interaction even whether it’s a smartphone or whether it’s a, uh, laptop, uh, when you’re doing email it could allow you to really be in that moment and have a much higher quality experience. When you’re feeling stressed and when you’re feeling disconnected or mindless, the breathing exercise I talked about is an awesome way to just reconnect and get more centered. And it’s a bell that could go off in your mind that tells you, come back to who I am. So I could be in the moment and experience what I’m doing. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER Now, I thought it was really interesting that in the beginning of your talk you mentioned some evidence based approaches that integrate mindfulness. Um, but all of them were, I think, you said cognitive and behave – or cognitive behavioral approaches -- 

00:20:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:20:45
SHANNON DERMER -- basically. Which I don’t usually think of as very mindful. Uh, because you mentioned, you know, the here and now in the moment. And I usually think of those as experiential approaches. Uh, so could you talk a little bit about, um, I guess, you don’t have to be experiential to be mindful. 

00:21:05
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ That’s true. The four approaches that I talked about are cognitive behavioral versions of mindfulness based -- 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER Uh-huh. 

00:21:15
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ -- treatments. And I think one of the main reasons why that’s the case is to make mindfulness more palatable in western society. Because CBT is almost a watchword of – of mental health at this point and it cuts across so many different treatment approaches there’s been this merging of CBT and mindfulness so people can better understand it. And it feels a little more comfortable for them. But, the key underneath it all is mindfulness. That’s really the driver of it. It – it’s just that the theory or the approach to it incorporates cognitive or behavioral interventions on top of the mindfulness. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So still the core is, kind of, being in the moment and experiencing. But then you kind of dress it up in different ways that might make it more palatable or measurable or -- 

00:22:15
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:22:15
SHANNON DERMER -- easily integrate into some of the western counseling approaches. 

00:22:15
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ I think so. Yes. 

00:22:20
SHANNON DERMER Why do you think it’s taken so long – like, I was in Thailand not too long ago. And, um, meditation and mindfulness is not even something they really label. It’s just part of their everyday life. Even we’re at a conference and they start off by meditating and they take certain breaks. And you talked about food. They’re very much into tasting their food and enjoying their food. And, um – uh, and so it was just kind of an every – a part of their every minute of life there. 

00:22:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:22:45
SHANNON DERMER Why do you think it’s taken so long, or it’s been a little bit of a struggle until recently for that to be part of more western culture. 

00:22:55
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ It has to do with our roots. From a way back when. It has to do with positivistic science of understanding in linear rational concrete way, how to categorize things. It has to do with our mindset of prediction and control. We spend almost all of our day, don’t we, focused on either the past or the future. Very little time actually being where we are in the moment. And if you think of many eastern cultures, Thailand is one example. They’re very present centered. They’re almost not even thinking about tomorrow, let alone a week or a month from now. And they’re enjoying life, they’re smiling, they’re in touch with each other. Because they’re there. It – it’s amazing to think of how much we live without even being where we are, isn’t it. 

00:23:55
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:23:55
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. Yeah. And like I said, when I was there it was -- although it was interesting because in some ways when we’re trying to schedule the trip and stuff it was very hard to get them to make future plans. 

00:24:05
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER They’re so very different then, uh, western culture in a lot of ways. Of course there were commonalities, but yeah, they were just really much more relaxed and it wasn’t that bad things weren’t happening. But they didn’t – I think you called it, suffering. It wasn’t that, you know, pain doesn’t happen. But they – they weren’t as in tuned to the suffering part, just what they can learn from the pain. 

00:24:25
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:24:25
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yeah. It’s really how you perceive things. And you can have the same event and 10 different people will perceive it 10 different ways. If you perceive something as an inconvenience, you might ignite a little bit of suffering. If you perceive something as a catastrophe, it could really, really turn pain or – or a slight inconvenience into something that really dominates your whole life. And – and leads you to carry a black cloud over your head for hours, days or weeks even. But if you perceive something as just part of life, that comes and goes, because nothing is permanent, and you even laugh it off, you could even perceive it as fun. Believe it or not. And I think in Thailand, as an example, that’s very, very common. Things just don’t tend to bother them in the same way. Whereas here, things really escalate in our mind. And we have a negativity bias in some way, that unfortunately it tends to make life a lot harder. And make us suffer more than we need to. 

00:25:40
SHANNON DERMER Now, in that discussion right there I can see how you can blend that with some cognitive approaches. It’s, uh, what we’re experiencing in the moment but then how we label it during and – and after that either creates suffering or doesn’t. You know, some of those cognitions we have. And that maybe here in the United States and other places we do have a negativity bias where, um, we do see conflict and, uh, and pain and some of those things we – we put them in terms of, um, suffering. 

00:26:10
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:26:10
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ And that there intolerable for us. The difference in – one of the differences between traditional CBT and a more mindfulness based approach is that in CBT, things to be seen as wrong or bad or unwanted. For example, irrational believes. In mindfulness it’s different. Things are seen as skillful or unskillful. Skillful meaning, how is this helping you have more conscious influence over your life. And promoting happiness versus not. And then it becomes more of a choice. And it’s something that you’re invested in. It’s something that you can learn to accept and – and guide. Versus having a problem and then creating a problem of the problem. By saying you have a thought that’s negative and that thought is wrong or irrational and it tends to escalate the negativity. That’s why I mentioned that mindfulness is a much more homeopathic truly person centered approach. And that’s one reason why I love it. 

00:27:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Versus, you have to label something, diagnosis it, fix it. 

00:27:30
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Exactly. 

00:27:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Okay. Very good. So, we have a little bit of time left. So I want to ask you just real quickly, um, in your supervision with, uh, counselors, how do you teach them to be mindful in session. I know you talk about they have to be mindful in their everyday life. But how do you teach them to be mindful in session. 

00:27:50
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Couple different ways. One way is helping people become calm and centered. It could be through breathing. It could be through simply slowing down. How you converse with them. You – second way is modeling mindfulness. If you as a supervisor are present, and you are centered and grounded, the supervisee picks up on that. And it really creates an atmosphere of being in touch with each other, in touch with what you’re talking about. Much more powerful. And the third way is actually discussing mindfulness. Sounds funny. But talking to them about what they’re experiencing in this moment and accepting that so they can be more in touch with that. And use that information. It’s powerful. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER Very good. Well thank you for discussing mindfulness with us. And if you’d like to learn more about this please go to the Alexander Street uh, Press website in a very mindful way. And check out some of the talks by Dr. Schwartz and by others. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And I want to thank you, especially, Dr. Schwartz for the fascinating discussion.
