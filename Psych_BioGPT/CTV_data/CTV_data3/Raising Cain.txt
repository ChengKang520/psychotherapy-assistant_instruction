00:00:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Boys in America have so much going for them. Enormous energy, opportunity, enthusiasm. 

00:00:10
MIKE NEVIN Everybody shut up and listen! 

00:00:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON But they're also in serious trouble... 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN Here a good-- 

00:00:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Doing worse in the classroom now than they did 10 years ago... 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN What's up, daddy? 

00:00:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hard to talk to, unaware of their emotions... 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN Just swing or else! 

00:00:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON And the most violent in the industrialized world. Why are our boys having such trouble, and what can we do about it? 

00:00:40
P.J. I knew that I was angry because I was always mad. 

00:00:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON My name's Michael Thompson. I'm a psychologist. I believe that we can help our boys, but first we must better understand their psychology. 

00:00:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Play violence is not violence, and we lose credibility with boys when we think it is. 

00:00:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON In this program, I'm going to show you new research exploring boys' inner lives, as well as innovative programs that help bring out the best in boys. 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN Boys need room to get up and move around. 

00:01:05
GEOFFREY CANADA We've got to get men as role models in these boys' lives 

00:01:10
P.J. Hi, dad. 

00:01:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON And I'm going to introduce you to a group of remarkable boys. We gave some of them cameras. And the footage they shot will help us enter their hearts and minds. 

00:01:25
MIKE NEVIN That's all there is to me. 

00:01:30
Raising Cain with Michael Thompson Viewers Like You... Thank you 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN National funding for this program was made possible by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you. 

00:01:40
Active Little Boys 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN You tell me when to push. Oh! Oh, god, I felt that! Oh, my-- oh, my... 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN There he is. 

00:01:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's a boy. 

00:02:00
[music] 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Take him over. 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Hi! 

00:02:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON What makes a boy a boy? 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:02:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Is it biology, his genes? Or must he be taught to be a boy? 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Wanna hold daddy's finger? 

00:02:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Is it nature? Or is it nurture? The answer of course is both, nature and nurture. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN Hello! 

00:02:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Now, we can't do much about nature... 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN See your little brother? 

00:02:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON But we can improve the way we raise our boys - 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN I missed you, mom. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN I missed you, too, honey. 

00:02:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON - at home, in school, and after school. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN You and me are big brother now. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN You are. 

00:02:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON But first, we've got to correct some common misconceptions. They start early on, with our stereotypes about baby boys and girls. I've come here to consult with an expert on the subject. 

00:03:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hi, I'm Michael Thompson. 

00:03:10
ROBIN MULDOON Hi, I'm Robin. 

00:03:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's nice to meet you. You've got some babies for us today. 

00:03:15
ROBIN MULDOON We certainly do. We have three boys and one girl. 

00:03:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON And can you tell the difference between boys and girls when, when you just have them in the nursery like this? 

00:03:25
ROBIN MULDOON No. 

00:03:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON You don't see any gender difference? 

00:03:25
ROBIN MULDOON None. 

00:03:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON How many years have you been at this? 

00:03:30
ROBIN MULDOON Twenty-three. 

00:03:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Okay. 

00:03:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Research confirms what head nurse Robin Muldoon is saying. Genetically, baby boys and girls have far more similarities than differences. 

00:03:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON I get the boy here. 

00:03:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON But in spite of the similarities, as this baby boy grows up, he'll be bombarded with messages that tell him he must deny parts of his emotional life to become a man. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Go! 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! 

00:04:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Consider the football player. He exemplifies our traditional view of masculinity. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Ready! 

00:04:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Young boys hunger for men to tell them how to be masculine. And men give instructions based on their conceptions of boys' psychology. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Bang! 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Boys have to get their aggression out. I don't care what anybody says. They have to get it out. And so let's do it here versus somewhere else. 

00:04:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON When boys hear themselves described as aggressive, they try to live up to that expectation. 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Bang 'em up!! 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN What do you get to do in football that you don't get to do in normal life? 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN You get to nail people. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, and what's good about that? 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN You get to hurt them. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN You get to kick ass. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN Hey, hey! You've gotta play tough here. Tad, Rockwell, you gotta start smashing people, okay? Otherwise they're gonna smash you! Okay? 

00:05:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Men often tell boys that anger is a manly emotion, but feelings of vulnerability and fear are not. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Joey! Joey! You guys know what pass blocking is? 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Yeah? How come nobody did it? 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN I did. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Huh? You gotta go in there and you gotta be tough, but you can't be sissying out, all right? 

00:05:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Maybe that's what the coach's father taught him. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN You gotta be tougher than they are! That's the bottom line! 

00:05:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON And so it goes, from generation to generation. 

00:05:35
[music] 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN What is it that makes a man a man? 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN Not crying over nothing. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN A man is somebody who's not a wuss and doesn't cry all the time. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Tough, never cries, doesn't cry a lot. 

00:05:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON You know when a 9-year-old boy says that boys shouldn't cry, he may suddenly remember that he himself cried twice that day already, and that raises a doubt which hangs over every boy's head. Am I man enough? 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN When, when I think of how I be a man when I grow up? I'm gonna grow up like my big brother. 

00:06:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Are boys naturally tough and aggressive? Sometimes. Are they tougher than girls? Remarkable new research suggests a surprising answer to that question. Neurologist Katherine Weinberg of the Harvard University Medical School is conducting experiments that are changing some basic ideas about the psychology of infant boys and girls 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN And then you want to strap her in so she doesn't go anywhere. 

00:06:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hi, Katherine. It's nice to see you. 

00:06:50
KATHERINE WEINBERG Very nice meeting you. 

00:06:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Are we ready for the experiment? 

00:06:50
KATHERINE WEINBERG Yes, I think so. 

00:06:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON We've got a baby? 

00:06:55
KATHERINE WEINBERG Yes, we have a baby all ready. 

00:06:55
LENA 5-month-old 

00:06:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON The experiment will test how infant boys and girls react when their mothers ignore them. The mother has been instructed to just play with the baby as she normally would for 2 minutes. 

00:07:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Okay. 

00:07:10
KATHERINE WEINBERG Yay! Yay! 

00:07:15
KATHERINE WEINBERG And then she's going to turn her back to the baby for a few seconds. 

00:07:20
[music] 

00:07:25
KATHERINE WEINBERG And then come back and keep what we call a still face, which is basically a poker face. We want to see what the baby does in response. 

00:07:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Okay. 

00:07:40
KATHERINE WEINBERG So she looks around, looks around the room. 

00:07:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON She remains calm and composed. Since 1999, Weinberg has tested hundreds of infant girls. Seventy percent of them react like Lena. 

00:08:00
KATHERINE WEINBERG Okay. 

00:08:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON And now Katherine brings in an infant boy and his mother. 

00:08:05
KATHERINE WEINBERG Just swivel the chair and then look in that direction basically. Do you have any questions at all before we begin? 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Um, are you going to cue me just when to do what thing? 

00:08:10
KATHERINE WEINBERG Yes, I will. Okay, great. 

00:08:10
DESMOND 5-month-old 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Do you wanna play peekaboo with mommy? Where's mommy? A-a-ah, where's mommy? Peekaboo! 

00:08:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON After Katherine asks the mother to stop interacting, baby Desmond responds very differently than baby Lena. 

00:08:35
KATHERINE WEINBERG He's clearly telling her, I don't like this, you know, just stop it. 

00:08:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Many baby boys, like Desmond, become distressed without their mother's attention. They can't calm themselves. 

00:08:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON With these babies that we followed today, we're seeing the patterns that you see always. 

00:08:55
KATHERINE WEINBERG Yes, yes, definitely. And the baby, of course, greets her. 

00:09:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON So Weinberg's research upsets our stereotypes. Baby boys are, in fact, more emotionally vulnerable than baby girls. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Wanna play peekaboo with momma? Ready? 

00:09:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON But we soon begin to treat young boys as if they had less of an emotional life than girls, because we start to focus on another boy behavior, their greater physical activity. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Is that funny? 

00:09:25
[music] 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN It may come as a surprise to learn that aggressive behavior among boys and girls peaks not in adolescence but around age 2. 

00:09:45
[music] 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN No! No! 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN Ah-ha-ha-ha. 

00:09:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Sometimes, even the most well-run child care setting can look like a free-for-all. After age 2 aggression declines, but more slowly among boys. In fact, for the rest of their childhood, boys will tend to be more physically active and more impulsive than girls of the same age and less developmentally mature. The reason, in large part, is biological. In the womb, boys' brains are washed in androgen, male hormones that predispose them to greater physical activity. But biology is not the only factor that shapes boys' behavior. Just as important is the way our society manages it. Of course adults must intervene if kids are in danger, but too often, even the smallest act of aggression rings adult alarm bells as if it were adult violence. But is that the only way to handle it? To try this answer this question, I've come to Arizona State University in Tempe to visit anthropologist Joe Tobin. 

00:11:20
JOE TOBIN He looks over at the teacher. 

00:11:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON For more than 20 years, Joe's been studying the ways that preschools in Japan handle boy aggression, and what he's found may come as a real surprise to the average American parent. 

00:11:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Okay. 

00:11:35
JOE TOBIN Let's look at this clip that's the most notorious moment in our study. This is after lunch, and the kids are sitting out on the balcony. The teacher is just inside, 10 feet away. 

00:11:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Okay. 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN Hiroki, in the overalls here, hits Sitoshi, the boy in yellow. 

00:11:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON The teacher's right there but she's not doing anything. In fact, she's ignoring it. What's, what's Sitoshi supposed to do? 

00:12:00
JOE TOBIN He goes back and wants satisfaction from Hiroki, so he will now-- reaches over to Hiroki with his ninja throwing star. He's made his aluminum foil from lunch into a ninja star. 

00:12:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Of course. 

00:12:15
JOE TOBIN He would-- as you would. Now he holds his hand out and Hiroki now is going to-- with his bare foot is going to step on Sitoshi's hand. And Sitoshi starts sobbing, but Midori to the rescue. 

00:12:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Aha. 

00:12:30
JOE TOBIN Midori comes over, leads him away from Hiroki, and talks to him, and she says, what happened? Of course she knows what happened; she was watching. He says, yeah, Hiroki hit-- punched me, then he stepped on my hand. 

00:12:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yes. 

00:12:45
JOE TOBIN Anthropologist 

00:12:45
JOE TOBIN She repeats it. Yeah, he got stepped on by Hiroki. And the other girl says, that always happens when you play with Hiroki. If you don't wanna get hurt, play with someone else. American teachers who see the footage of the nonintervention mostly are horrified because they feel that their prime directive is that nobody be hurt in their classroom. And they are-- feel that you have to intervene for two reasons: one, to protect children from being hurt; two, to protect children from developing bad habits of hurting. The Japanese approach, which I endorse, is, if you start when they're young communicating to them that they are responsible for their interactions with each other and to the inter-- and to the social climate of the classroom, they will learn to take responsibility for it. 

00:13:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON So they will teach each other conflict resolution if we're not intervening constantly. 

00:13:35
JOE TOBIN When you ask Japanese teachers, what's the most important reason to have preschool, or to send kids to preschool, they don't say academics; that's just 1%. Their top answer is children need a chance to learn to be a member of a group. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON So Japanese preschools have a different attitude towards boys' aggressiveness. And, as Joe discovered when he returned in 2002, there's also a higher expectation of boys' ability to empathize, to have an emotional connection with other children. 

00:14:00
JOE TOBIN Every day after nap time, five or six of the older kids go downstairs, and they're called monitors. Now, the older boy has taken the 2-year-old boy into-- to the urinal. 

00:14:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Right. 

00:14:15
JOE TOBIN And he says, "pee, please." And the younger boy starts to pee. He helps him pick his shirt up because he's afraid he's gonna pee on his shirt. 

00:14:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Right. 

00:14:25
JOE TOBIN These things happen. Then he says, ah, "is it coming out?" He says, "anything left in your pee-pee?" And then he says, "okay, now I'm gonna flush." 

00:14:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yeah. 

00:14:35
JOE TOBIN He flushes. 

00:14:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON And the little boy screams. 

00:14:40
JOE TOBIN And what I love about this is, this is teaching at its finest. 

00:14:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Right. 

00:14:45
JOE TOBIN This older boy is teaching a subject matter he knows a lot about and loves. 

00:14:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Right. 

00:14:50
JOE TOBIN He pretends to be afraid of the sound of the flush. He's young enough to remember what it must be like to be both excited and afraid of the sound of the flush - 

00:15:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Right. 

00:15:00
JOE TOBIN - so he performs with the younger boy - 

00:15:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Right. 

00:15:00
JOE TOBIN - this excitement and fear. 

00:15:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON And that's perfect empathy. 

00:15:05
JOE TOBIN And then he says, like, "oh, we're not afraid." When I asked them, why do you let the older kids play with babies, they said we do it for the sake of the older kids. Because if you don't take care of a younger kid when you're-- yourself young, you may miss a critical period for developing (inaudible ). It's a word that means something like empathy. 

00:15:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Here's a wonderful example of children resolving a conflict on their own. After the boy hits her, the girl walks away. Will she call the teacher? No. Because the boy literally puts himself at her level to show her he's sorry. This doesn't mean that Japanese schools are perfect. Bullying becomes a serious problem in older grades. But schools here seem to be less frightened of young boys than U.S. schools, where even a young boy's violent fantasies can sometimes get him into trouble. At the Touchstone School in Grafton, Massachusetts, 5-year-old Seth is about to discover that his imagination can create problems. 

00:16:25
Seth 

00:16:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Seth enjoys learning, and plays well with his classmates. At this age, boys and girls prefer the company of their own gender. The girls, on average, are up to a year ahead of the boys in verbal and fine-motor skills. And there are psychological differences as well. While boys and girls still play games like hide-and-seek together. Their fantasy lives have begun to differ. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN I want to hear from Rachel, Ray... 

00:17:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Seth's teacher, Jane Katch, sees these differences emerge in the stories that the children create. 

00:17:25
JANE KATCH Each morning, I have the kids come to this table and tell me a story, and I write it down in their words. On there was-- what's this? A panda. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Then an elephant came over. 

00:17:40
JANE KATCH And then an elephant came over. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN They all had a sleepover. 

00:17:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Girls tend to tell stories about friendship and family. Boys' stories are often much more dramatic, with lots of conflict and violence. 

00:17:50
JANE KATCH Now, we have a lot of stories from this morning. 

00:17:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Jane wrote a wonderful book, Under Deadman's Skin, about boys' fantasies, the problems they can create, and the best way to handle them. 

00:18:05
JANE KATCH So we left off with Seth? Okay, very good. "There was a unicorn, and its friend was a horse. And the horse got killed by a very old man. The unicorn killed the old man, and then the unicorn lived happily ever after." 

00:18:25
JANE KATCH Almost all the girls agreed that this made them sad. 

00:18:30
JANE KATCH What about you, Lydia? 

00:18:30
LYDIA It doesn't-- it makes me feel bad for the horse and the old man because I really live on a horse farm and I really care about horses more than anything in the whole world, and I really don't like that part. 

00:18:45
JANE KATCH Teacher and Author 

00:18:50
JANE KATCH That idea spread very quickly among the girls, that the boys shouldn't tell these violent stories. 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN I agree with Lydia. 

00:18:55
JANE KATCH So horses are really important to you? 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:19:00
JANE KATCH Okay. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN I agree with Lydia, too. 

00:19:00
JANE KATCH Okay. 

00:19:00
JANE KATCH Seth said he really wanted it to be that way, that he didn't feel okay about just having the old man faint, which was what the girls wanted the solution to be. 

00:19:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON In many schools, teachers simply impose a solution: no violent stories allowed. But Jane believes that it's important for the children to work through the issue themselves, even though it can be a struggle. 

00:19:25
JANE KATCH And, Seth, what about you? 

00:19:30
SETH I like it when people don't change the story. 

00:19:35
JANE KATCH Okay, so he told his story, and he doesn't want people to change it. Now we have a real problem to solve. Emily, and then Kelly. 

00:19:40
JANE KATCH So the authors write to tell a meaningful story. The way it feels right seemed very clear. At the same time, the intensity of the kids' wishes to not have violence that made them uncomfortable also seemed really important. And I don't know how they're going to solve that problem. 

00:20:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON I left the class at this point to fetch a scholar with special insight into the issue. Tom Newkirk teaches writing at the University of New Hampshire. In his remarkable book, misreading masculinity, Tom argues that boys lag behind girls in literacy largely because teachers discourage them from reading and writing about the things they're interested in. 

00:20:25
TOM NEWKIRK There's schools that want to eliminate violence in writing. Are you going to eliminate violence in reading, too? That would cut out everything! That would cut out, you know, 90% of the plots that have ever been written. I think violent writing tests our fear, it tests-- we're exploring our fear, fear of death. 

00:20:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON You and Jane are some of the only two people I know who are willing to come out in print and say, this is what boys want to talk about and write about. 

00:20:50
TOM NEWKIRK It's part of human nature to be fascinated with, with death, with battles, and I don't think that interest turns you into, ah, killers. I think there are some limits you have to set. For example, I don't think you could have a violent story in a classroom where another kid in the class is the object of that violence. 

00:21:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON How did you come to your understanding that it was okay, that it wasn't dangerous? 

00:21:15
Tom Newkirk at 4 years old 

00:21:15
TOM NEWKIRK Well, I was partly thinking of what I was like as a kid. You know, I was into violence. I was into cowboys and Indians. I had my pistols, you know. I had the whole works. And I didn't turn into a killer. 

00:21:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON When I returned with Tom, we got a surprise. The class had decided that there could be no more stories about dying, only fainting. With Jane's permission, we asked the children to talk about their decision. 

00:21:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Erica, do you ever write stories about animals dying? You never do? 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN I write about fainting. 

00:21:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Is fainting as good as dying in a story? No. Why isn't it as good? 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN Because you don't-- you just run out of breath. Like, you're running, and you have to slow down. 

00:22:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON And that's fainting. And how is dying different from fainting? 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN You die like... 

00:22:15
JANE KATCH All right, let's go. 

00:22:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON What about kindergarten stories about death? 

00:22:20
TOM NEWKIRK Well, I wonder whether death in these stories is similar to death when they're out in the playground and, you know, you die. You fall down, then you're up again. It's not a real thing. It's play. 

00:22:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON I know so many parents who are upset by that. 

00:22:35
TOM NEWKIRK I think that they're upset because they think that this kind of play will lead to real-life aggression. Most boys have a sense of what's reality and what's fantasy and what's play and what's real. 

00:22:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON So does this mean it's okay to expose children to violent tv, movies, and video games? Jane cautions that images of graphic violence can be harmful to children under 7. 

00:23:05
TOM NEWKIRK The violence in their inner life doesn't have a lot of gore at age 5. It doesn't have blood. And so, when they see the violence in the movies, it makes a change in their fantasy life that I think is really troublesome to them. I think it's really scary to them. 

00:23:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON But as much as we need to protect boys from the worst of media violence, we must be careful not to stifle their natural fantasy life. Sure enough, when Seth goes to write another story, it's clear that the no-dying rule causes him problems. 

00:23:50
SETH It was another horse. 

00:23:55
JANE KATCH It was another horse. 

00:24:00
SETH But it got fainted. 

00:24:05
JANE KATCH The horse got fainted? How come it got fainted? 

00:24:10
SETH I don't know. 

00:24:10
JANE KATCH I've never seen him hesitate like that. Usually he comes, sits down at the table, he's got his story, he tells it. And it feels great to him, you can tell. And this time he couldn't figure out what to say. 

00:24:25
JANE KATCH Usually you just sit down and you tell your story, and this seems like much harder today to tell your story than usual. Is that because you wanted to say it got killed but the girls didn't like it the other day? 

00:24:40
SETH No. I don't know why. 

00:24:45
JANE KATCH You don't know why. Okay. 

00:24:50
JANE KATCH It's very confusing to little boys growing up now because on one hand, all around them, they see violence: on the news, in the movies, on video games. And at the same time, they're getting the message that the fantasies that boys seem to have always had are bad. 

00:25:15
JANE KATCH Here's another problem that came up. 

00:25:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON So Jane decides to reopen the discussion about violence in stories. 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN We should make a rule that nice guys can't get killed. 

00:25:25
JANE KATCH You should make a rule-- wait a minute. Would you finish chewing? 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN That nice guys can't get killed. 

00:25:35
JANE KATCH Okay. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN I don't like when people who are good got killed or animals got killed, because they're good. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN If we killed people, because people are made of god, and god's good. 

00:25:50
JANE KATCH What about bad guys? 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN I don't mind them getting killed. 

00:25:55
JANE KATCH And what about bad guys getting killed? 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN I don't mind that. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN I don't mind the bad guys getting killed because they're bad. 

00:26:00
JANE KATCH Now, is there anybody who has a problem with acting out all the stories with only the bad guys dying and no good guys dying? Is there anybody who has a problem with that? 

00:26:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Even Seth seems to be okay with the new rule. 

00:26:20
JANE KATCH You're all okay with that? Great. All right, then we solved the problem that we were having for such a long time. 

00:26:25
JANE KATCH I think the danger is giving the boys who are having those thoughts the idea that it says something bad about them as people. 

00:26:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON This, for me, is the crux of the issue. Our schools have to make the distinction between actual violence, which must be discouraged, and fantasy violence, which should be accommodated. Otherwise, we risk giving boys one more reason to believe that school's not a place for them. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN I like school. Some stuff are pretty fun to do. Some stuff are somewhat hard. It's kind of hard, and it's boring. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN It's, like, hard to concentrate. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN I probably think it's easier for girls. 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN It might be easier for girls because sometimes the teachers favor girls. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN Most of the teachers are girls, and some teachers don't like boys because they think they're, like, mean and nasty. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN And people say boys are, like, bad and girls are, like, so nice. 

00:27:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON You know, it's tough being a boy in school. By ages 10 and 11, girls perform equally well as boys in math and science and much better in reading and writing. Boys are still less emotionally mature, more physically active, and more impulsive. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Andrew? 

00:27:55
ANDREW Yes? 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN That's not working. 

00:28:00
ANDREW I know. 

00:28:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON That leads many boys to conclude that school is a place where the deck is stacked against them. 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN All right. I'll come back. 

00:28:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON But, as we shall see, an understanding teacher can help change that attitude. 

00:28:10
Kevin 

00:28:10
STEVE OTERI Teacher 

00:28:15
STEVE OTERI Kevin is a very charming boy. Maybe. I'll think about it tonight, I said. When I got a haircut one day, the next day, "boy, Mr. Oteri, you look good today." He's funny. He's energetic. I think he will be mayor of Melrose someday. 

00:28:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Melrose is a middle-class mostly White community outside Boston. At the Lincoln School, Mr. Oteri's fifth-grade class has 14 boys and five girls. Nationally, boys account for 70% of the Ds and Fs given out at school. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN Morgan. 

00:29:00
STEVE OTERI It's half of a rectangle. 

00:29:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Why the difference? Well, what's school all about? School's mostly about sitting down and listening to an adult talk. 

00:29:10
STEVE OTERI Our formula is one-half times the base... 

00:29:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON For boys like Kevin, that can be very hard to do. 

00:29:20
STEVE OTERI Six is the base, times five, the height. 

00:29:20
STEVE OTERI Kevin and I have had challenging days. 

00:29:25
STEVE OTERI Base is six. Height is five. One-half times... 

00:29:30
STEVE OTERI He does have a hard time focusing. 

00:29:30
STEVE OTERI Now what's our formula for area of a triangle again? Kevin? 

00:29:35
KEVIN Um, five and six? 

00:29:35
STEVE OTERI What's the formula? How do we figure it out? 

00:29:40
STEVE OTERI And when he does get distracted, uhm, it, it definitely takes away from what he has to get done. 

00:29:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Last year Kevin's distractibility caused his grades to fall. He got mostly Cs, and he sometimes disrupted class. 

00:29:55
STEVE OTERI Kevin? Kevin? Kevin? Homework. Take out your homework. 

00:30:05
STEVE OTERI Kevin is, is a handful. 

00:30:05
KEVIN What? They're videotaping me drink! 

00:30:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Kevin may push things to an extreme, but his energetic behavior is typical for boys his age. So it's no surprise what boys say they like most about school. 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Uh, gym. 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Gym. 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Gym. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Uh, recess. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Recess. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN I like lunch. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Snacks. 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN That's pretty much it. 

00:30:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Thirty years ago, elementary schools offered recess twice a day. Boys got a chance to work off their physical energy. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Kevin! 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Kevin! 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Kevin. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN No! 

00:30:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON But there's only one recess at Kevin's school, to make more time for classes. Some schools are even eliminating recess altogether. I believe that's a real mistake. Boys in particular need more recess, not less, to become more effective students. 

00:31:05
STEVE OTERI Adam, you haven't read yet? Okay, hold on, I'll get to you. What's your question, Jess? 

00:31:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON All too often, this behavior gets labeled as a disorder. 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN Ke-vin. 

00:31:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Now, there's no denying that some boys do have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In fact, they're nearly three times more likely than girls to have ADHD. But when almost 85% of the world's stimulant medication gets prescribed to American boys, we have to ask the question: Are we medicating boys because they're sick or because they're boys? 

00:31:35
STEVE OTERI I have mixed feelings on it. As an educator, I've seen it work wonders with kids. You can see, with some kids, when they're not on their medication and when they are on their medication it-- it's very clear. As a parent, I have a different feeling about it. Uhm, I don't know if I'd want my son or daughter having to take a pill every day. 

00:32:00
JENNIFER MARSHALL What's up, Kev? 

00:32:00
KEVIN Hi, Jada. 

00:32:05
JENNIFER MARSHALL Kevin's Mom 

00:32:10
JENNIFER MARSHALL I think a lot of people, in general, don't get boys. I mean, i think they're judged right off the bat from just being a boy, especially when they're young. Just to jump the gun and say, "oh, they're not really listening. They probably need medicine." You know, that's, that's really not the case. 

00:32:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Should a boy like Kevin be medicated? In a lot of schools, he probably would be. But Kevin's parents and Mr. Oteri are trying to make school into a place where Kevin can succeed without drugs. 

00:32:40
STEVE OTERI Five minus four? 

00:32:40
KEVIN I smell popcorn. 

00:32:45
STEVE OTERI Five minus four? 

00:32:45
KEVIN One and one-fourth. 

00:32:45
STEVE OTERI Okay, so one and one-fourth. Now, which is bigger? 

00:32:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Helping Kevin is a lot of work. Every Tuesday after school, Mr. Oteri on his own time provides special tutoring for Kevin and other boys. 

00:33:00
KEVIN Well, that's only the first one. 

00:33:00
STEVE OTERI That's all right. 

00:33:05
KEVIN That was hard. 

00:33:05
STEVE OTERI You don't have to rush through this, Kevin. 

00:33:05
JENNIFER MARSHALL This is the first year he's had a male teacher, which I think worked out. Great. Kevin loves his teacher. He can relate to all these boys in the class. This is the step you take slowly. 

00:33:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Today fewer than one in nine elementary schoolteachers in the U.S. is a man. Attracting more male teachers might help improve boys' performance. 

00:33:30
STEVE OTERI Kevin. Let me finish talking. Adam, sit. You stop. And you stop. Kevin, you're smart enough to do that problem. You need to stop, though. 

00:33:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Still, it's not easy for Kevin or Mr. Oteri. So to keep Kevin engaged, Mr. Oteri has come up with other creative strategies. 

00:33:50
STEVE OTERI I might see him struggling with something that we're working on in class, and his frustration level will build, and then he'll shut down and I'll lose him for the rest of the afternoon. Or if he's disrupting the other students in class, I'll send him around the school with a note that just says, "I'm on a walk." 

00:34:10
STEVE OTERI Where are you going? 

00:34:15
KEVIN I gotta go downstairs for a second. 

00:34:15
STEVE OTERI Why? 

00:34:15
KEVIN Because, uhm, uh, I gotta-- just, uhm, go around the building, like, because I have to like I don't know really why, but-- I have to, like, uhm, like, walk around the building and then come back up. 

00:34:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Kevin gets sent on these walks a couple of times a week. 

00:34:35
STEVE OTERI So why doesn't everyone else? 

00:34:40
KEVIN Um, because I'm lucky. 

00:34:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Kevin is lucky, lucky to have a dedicated teacher like Mr. Oteri and parents who advocate for him. So far this year, his grades reflect that. They've climbed from Cs to Bs. But in other communities, it's a much tougher struggle to keep boys engaged in school. 

00:35:05
[music] 

00:35:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON In the Bronx, boys' test scores are the lowest in New York city. Partly that's due to pervasive poverty. But another big factor is the culture of the streets, which scorns academic success as unmanly. 

00:35:30
[music] 

00:35:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Bright boys get teased and bullied. By sixth grade, many boys simply give up trying at school. 

00:35:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON The thing I really want to know about... 

00:35:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON I talked to a group of academically gifted boys from the inner city who left public schools because of bullying. 

00:35:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Did you feel as safe where you were in school before? 

00:35:55
OSCAR No, because there was a lot of fights back there. 

00:35:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON There was? Are you a big fighter, Oscar? 

00:36:00
OSCAR Well... 

00:36:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Not really. 

00:36:00
OSCAR No. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN I was in the fourth grade, and I was sort of little for my age, so I would get picked on a lot. So I used to act real tough so nobody would mess with me, and I used to get in trouble for that. 

00:36:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Did you get in fights? 

00:36:15
OSCAR There would a lot of bullies, and if they went to pick on you, then there would be nobody there, if it were you-- if it wasn't for your friends. 

00:36:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Were you scared many days in school? And you don't mind admitting it? Ruben, were you scared many days in school? 

00:36:35
RUBEN Um, yeah, maybe sometimes. 

00:36:35
Ruben 

00:36:35
RUBEN Do I have to wear my sweater, grandma? 

00:36:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON The street culture was beginning to attract Ruben at his local public school. 

00:36:45
DOROTHY You got everything you need: your phone, your metro card? 

00:36:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON But luckily, his adoptive grandmother, Dorothy, took drastic action. 

00:36:50
DOROTHY You have a good day now. Bye, Ruben. Good-bye. Do well on that test. I'm serious. Okay. See you later. 

00:37:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON She enrolled Ruben in sixth grade at a new middle school on Manhattan's Lower East Side. To get there, Ruben must take two buses and two subways, almost an hour each way. That's a lot of responsibility for a boy who just turned 11. Today's a big day for Ruben. He has to take a midterm history test. Ruben's new school, the George Jackson Academy, is very different from his elementary school. For one thing, it's all boys. 

00:37:45
[music] 

00:37:50
BRIAN CARTY When we were doing the discussion yesterday, just about caring for one another, and there's a word that the guys were afraid to use, in terms of how they felt about each other. Anybody want to guess what that word was? 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Love. 

00:38:00
BRIAN CARTY Thank you. Thank you. Very good, good. Afraid to use it. And we probably are afraid to use it about talking about each other, too. So what we decided to do was to change our vocabulary, and we put a code word in. And the code word, we said, "I will be your brother." So to be a brother... 

00:38:25
BRIAN CARTY There should be options. We bought into coeducation as being the only model. Traditionally that was not. 

00:38:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON And then there was a girls' school in here. 

00:38:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Brother Brian Carty is a passionate champion of single-sex schools For economically disadvantaged inner-city boys. 

00:38:40
BRIAN CARTY Good high ceilings, plenty of space. So it's conducive to boys. They can get up, and they can move. 

00:38:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yes. 

00:38:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON He believes it's an environment that can turn boys on to learning. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Okay, everybody does a fraction. 

00:38:55
BRIAN CARTY How does an intellectual gift become feminized? As schools became-- it became a feminine thing. Look at the stats the people talk about. Who's applying to law school? Who's applying to med school? The predominant enrollments at Harvard and Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, all the big places. 

00:39:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Eighty percent of girls in Harlem say they want to be a doctor or a lawyer; 80% of boys in Harlem said they want to be an N.B.A. star. 

00:39:15
BRIAN CARTY Yeah. 

00:39:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's that dramatic. 

00:39:15
BRIAN CARTY It's that dramatic. 

00:39:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Brother Brian wants to change that statistic. To do that, he first had to provide bright boys like Ruben with something missing from their old schools: safety. 

00:39:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON What was the biggest change coming to a boys' school? 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Here you won't have the constant worry that something-- like, you might get, like, beat up or something like that. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Over here, everybody's, like, really nice to you and stuff and they respect you, and in my old school they were, like, really mean to everybody else. 

00:39:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Edwin, how did your life change? 

00:39:50
EDWIN My life changed when I came to George Jackson Academy because I didn't have to act tough all the time. There's no bullies over here. 

00:39:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON There's no bullies here? They don't permit it? 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN C'mon, c'mon, quick, quick, quick, guys, quick. No, books: shelf. You've got a test to take, fellas. 

00:40:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON After safety, the next thing was to set high academic standards, as in Ruben's history class, where he's about to take his test. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN If you want to, you can write on Athens and write on Sparta and that makes two short essays, so you either compare and contrast... 

00:40:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON At first, Ruben was intimidated by the classes. He wasn't used to working hard. In his old school, he'd been able to get high grades without much effort. And he missed his friends. 

00:40:35
RUBEN It was kind of hard for me to adjust in this school because, you know, it was harder work, and, you know, I couldn't even, like, blend in because, you know, I was, like, kind of nervous because I ain't know nobody. 

00:40:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON So Ruben stopped doing homework, and he stopped studying for tests. 

00:40:50
DOROTHY And then one time he said, well, "you can just take me out of there." He said, "maybe if I keep doing this, they'll kick me out." 

00:41:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Ah, do you think he was trying to get kicked out? 

00:41:00
DOROTHY I think he was. Ruben literally wanted to get kicked out of that school. 

00:41:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Really? 

00:41:10
DOROTHY Yes. 

00:41:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON The result: something Ruben had never seen before an F on his first-semester report card. 

00:41:15
RUBEN I felt really, really, really, really, really, I mean, you know, bad. I thought, you know I'm a failure and all that. 

00:41:30
DOROTHY He cried. "Grandma, but I never get an F. I never fail anything." When he saw that F on the paper, it turned him around. 

00:41:40
ANTWAN ALLEN Teacher 

00:41:45
ANTWAN ALLEN He very tearfully and apologetically said, "You know, I get it. I'm sorry. I want to do better." 

00:41:50
RUBEN It's like vice-ver-- it's like doing it backwards like... 

00:41:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Ruben has kept his word. He's been working harder, his grades have improved, and he's making friends. 

00:42:00
RUBEN No, I want some water. 

00:42:05
ANTWAN ALLEN He has this wonderful personality that just draws you to him. He's bright. He's articulate. He's a charmer. He's a really easy guy to just really get to love. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Ruben's a superstar! 

00:42:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON But it's not only the school's high academic standards and safety that benefit boys like Ruben. So does the absence of girls. 

00:42:35
ANTWAN ALLEN When there are females around, there's a pressure to act a certain way, dress a certain way, carry yourself in a certain way to attract attention or to be part of the in crowd. But when you're at an all-boys school, it allows you to really find who you are without some of the outside pressures. 

00:42:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON In co-ed middle schools, boys and girls enforce rigorous gender roles. Certain activities and interests are considered girls-only or boys-only. But it's different at schools like George Jackson. Here, Ruben and his friends can take what's typically a girls' game and transform it into a competitive boys' game. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN You can't do that! You can't do that! You gotta recharge! 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:30
BRIAN CARTY There needs to be establishing-- I'm going to call it an appropriate male culture, where there are a range of possibilities, and not just one. 

00:43:40
[music] 

00:43:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON The teachers even use boys' love of physical play as an opportunity for education. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Come back here! 

00:43:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON During this recess, they're playing the Trojan War. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN The sixth-graders are the ones playing the Trojan War because they're in ancient cive. This to me is like, I actually have gotten through to my students if they're willing to play the Trojan War on their free time. 

00:44:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Sixth-grade boys may be smart enough to reenact an ancient war, but they're not yet mature enough to do it safely. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Drop the weapons, okay? You can still have your sword. You can still have your spear, okay? But we have to be careful of the small children running around because without meaning to, we endanger them. You feel me? 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Now go defend Troy!! 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN I got a prisoner! Prisoner! Help! 

00:44:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON School's over, and Ruben begins his long journey home. He tells me he did well on the history test. 

00:44:45
DOROTHY Ruben has changed so much when I take him out now. It ain't the same little Ruben. Right now the change is, "I'm doing well, I want to go to a good school, I'm going to college." That's -- that's in his mind right now. It teach him how to be a man. And only a man can teach a boy that. 

00:45:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Soon, Ruben will start to become a man in the biological sense as he enters puberty, and puberty can raise some of the most difficult issues in a boy's life. 

00:45:30
[music] 

00:45:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Boys on average begin puberty around age 12, a year later than girls. Under the influence of testosterone, they grow taller, add muscle, bone, and facial and body hair. Their voices deepen, their skin erupts, and their sexuality blooms. And there are enormous emotional changes as well. All children, but boys in particular, begin to shift loyalty from family to friends. And boys now enforce on each other a narrow idea of what is masculine, sometimes harshly. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN It's all about skills! 

00:46:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON I call this the culture of cruelty. It's toughest on boys who are different. 

00:46:15
MIKE NEVIN It's 7:21 and I am sitting here. I'm very bored. 7:26. It's basically what my life is like. 

00:46:40
Mike 

00:46:40
MIKE NEVIN I'm Mike Nevin. I'm 13 years old. I play the drums. I'm not very into sports. I watch TV. I know, I'm a little overweight. Yes, yes. When I say a little overweight, I mean a lot. This is the living room. 

00:47:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Researchers tell us that one of the main reasons kids get teased is their weight. Mike's been heavy since third grade. 

00:47:10
MIKE NEVIN This is my parents' room, my brother's room, bathroom, and my room. Let me just hit the lights on. 

00:47:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON But Mike's weight isn't the only reason he's been teased. 

00:47:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON You said that you were not a regular guy like regular guys. 

00:47:25
MIKE NEVIN I don't consider myself one. Here is plenty of t-shirts, most of these collected from concerts. I got the Misfits, at the drive-in, Killswitch Engage, terror. 

00:47:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON What is a regular guy and what's a not-regular guy? 

00:47:45
MIKE NEVIN A regular guy in my school would be one of those popular kids, plays sports, friends with all the popular girls, usually would play, like, baseball or football, something like that. 

00:47:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Mike tried playing baseball, in part to please his father. 

00:48:00
JOE NEVIN Mike's Dad 

00:48:00
JOE NEVIN I loved playing baseball. Baseball was, you know, my thing growing up. 

00:48:05
MIKE NEVIN He was really into me playing sports, and I liked it at the time, but I started to move farther and farther away from sports. 

00:48:15
JOE NEVIN It became clear that that's not where he wanted to be. 

00:48:20
MIKE NEVIN This slayer shirt of mine. One from my favorite band, Lamb of God. Most kids, when I dyed my hair black, they were all, like, "Oh, you're such a goth. You dye your hair black and only wear black clothes." But I dyed my hair black because I thought it would look good on me, and I don't think it looks that bad. "When you're strange, faces come out of the rain. When you're strange, no one remembers your name." 

00:48:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Are you strange, mike? 

00:48:45
MIKE NEVIN I am definitely strange. 

00:48:50
[music] 

00:48:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON One of the things that makes Mike strange is his love of heavy metal music. 

00:49:00
MIKE NEVIN First, we were originally called, um, O.H.D., which stood for Obsolete Human Disorder. Me and the bassist, we were talking, and he said, "Mike, I have a good name for the band: Dystopia, an imaginary land of immense evil." And I thought, "Mm-hmm, sounds cool." 

00:49:20

JANET NEVIN I had some reservations. Then I was a little nervous about him-- the language, the intensity of the feelings that are expressed in metal music. I thought he was a little young for that. I was torn because he was-- he was so into the music and so passionate. 

00:49:50
MIKE NEVIN She finally gave in. She accepted the fact that her son is a Metalhead. 

00:49:55
JOE NEVIN He could be a good golfer. I told him he has to learn to play golf because, you know, a lot of rock and rollers play golf, too. 

00:50:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON The band's been together only a few months, but they've decided to risk playing their first public concert at a local teen center. It's just 4 weeks away. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, but the first half is... 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN The first half is... 

00:50:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON If they play poorly, they could face more ridicule. 

00:50:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Are you aware of paying a price For not going the mainstream boy way? 

00:50:25
MIKE NEVIN Yeah. 

00:50:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON What's the price you pay? 

00:50:30
MIKE NEVIN Getting called names, basically. 

00:50:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON What names have you been called? 

00:50:35
MIKE NEVIN Uh... 

00:50:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON The top five. 

00:50:40
MIKE NEVIN Goth, fag, loser, punk. I get called fat a lot. 

00:50:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON And that's all your life in elementary school? 

00:50:45
MIKE NEVIN Yeah. 

00:50:50
MIKE NEVIN I was in third grade, fourth grade... 

00:50:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Mike took me to his old elementary school where he was bullied. 

00:50:55
MIKE NEVIN It was actually right up there. 

00:50:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON After months of being the victim, Mike did what many victims do: he found another kid to pick on. 

00:51:05
MIKE NEVIN We would play kickball. When he would miss the ball, I would be like, loser or, "I can't believe you missed the ball," things like that. Just mean things, and sometimes I'd get him to the point where he'd cry and yell and scream and hit me and stuff. And that's exactly what I was trying to do. I was trying to provoke him to do something like that. It would make me feel better and get me more points with the popular kids. 

00:51:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Mike later apologized to the kid and stopped teasing him, But bullying is a national problem. Nearly one out of four boys is bullied in school, often physically. Mike's lucky. He wasn't beaten up. But words can be as painful as blows. 

00:51:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Do you think there is such a thing as a boy who isn't hurt by that kind of stuff? 

00:51:50
MIKE NEVIN Well, on the outside, yeah, but on the inside, no. Because somebody can call-- some boy can call another boy a fag or something like that, and they can-- they can just be, like, hey, ha, just laugh about it. But then, that day if they get home and, like, they don't have any friends over or brother isn't there or sister isn't there, things like that, they could just go up to their room and cry because it, it really hurts on the inside. Not a lot of people ever say that it hurts, but it really does hurt. 

00:52:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Parents always ask me, "How do I protect my son from this culture of cruelty?" And I have to tell them the sad truth: you can't. Every boy has to face the status hierarchy and find an identity which works for him. At school, part of Mike's identity is belonging to the band. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN From the beginning including piano. Ready? 

00:53:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's hard to keep a simple march beat when you've got rock and roll kicking inside your head. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Stop. Stop. Stop. 

00:53:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's 2 weeks before the concert. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN Jesus Christ! 

00:53:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON There's still a lot of work to do. The original bass player had to drop out, so they have to break in a new guy. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN I dropped my stick. I need a break. And here's the wonderful Mrs. Nevin. 

00:53:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Every child needs a friend or friends-- the number's not so important to help him survive the culture of cruelty. 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN Here's a picture of mike when he made his first communion. 

00:53:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Especially if he's outside the mainstream. A child that has no friends at all is a child I worry about. And teenage boys still need the support of their parents. Now, this may come as a shock to parents of seemingly uncommunicative teenage sons, but it's vital that parents find ways to stay connected to them. 

00:54:10
JOE NEVIN There you go. 

00:54:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Mike's lucky. His father Joe has found common ground with him in music. 

00:54:20
JOE NEVIN We go to a lot of concerts, too, and that's-- we have a lot of fun doing that. We're very excited about our annual pilgrimage to Ozzfest. 

00:54:30
MIKE NEVIN And warped tour. 

00:54:30
JOE NEVIN And warped tour. But Ozzfest is going to be fun this year. 

00:54:30
MIKE NEVIN Ozzfest is going to be very fun. 

00:54:35
JOE NEVIN I always wanted to play when I was a kid. I'd get the sears catalog, I'd go right to the musical instruments. I always wanted to be a rock star. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Guys! Guys! Guys! 

00:54:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's the big night at the teen center. 

00:54:50
MIKE NEVIN Tonight it's a concert. It's my band, Dystopia. It's a landmark in the Mike Nevin history of music. It's the first real concert. Can't wait, can't wait. 

00:55:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Mike's bravado masks how truly nervous he is. It's a scary event. The audience is made up of mostly high-school students. 

00:55:20
[music] 

00:55:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Finally, it's show time. 

00:55:25
MIKE NEVIN Hello. We're Dystopia from, ah, Melrose and all of them. Uhm, we're going to play a couple songs. Okay! Everybody shut up and listen! 

00:55:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON This is the first of five original songs they'll play. 

00:55:55
[music] 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN What's a heavy metal concert without a drum solo? 

00:56:10
[music] 

00:56:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON He's found his audience. Mike's weight, his clothes, and the color of his hair no longer matter. What matters is that they think he plays the drums very well. 

00:56:30
MIKE NEVIN Music is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I don't think I'd be able to live without music. 

00:56:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON All boys want to earn the respect of their peers. To do that, they have to demonstrate mastery of some skill that other boys appreciate: playing sports, working on cars, getting a well-paying job or playing in a rock and roll band. 

00:57:00
MIKE NEVIN This morning I was called Fat McGoth. If somebody was here that had made fun of me in the past, If they were here tonight, I don't think they would make fun of me anymore. 

00:57:10
[music] 

00:57:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Over the last hour, we've explored some myths about boys' emotional lives and high physical energy. And we've looked at new ways of working with boys. In the next hour, we'll meet boys in high school as they struggle to make the tough transition into manhood. For many boys, especially those without a father, this can be the hardest and most dangerous part of their journey. 

00:57:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Who's the most important man in your life? 

00:57:40
UNKNOWN Me. 

00:57:45
Turning Boys Into Men 

00:57:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON In America's inner cities, teenage boys must daily walk a gauntlet of violence, crime, and drugs. 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Let me see that. Who's that for? You let a nigger pass through like that? 

00:58:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Here in Chelsea, Massachusetts, drop-out rates and violent crime are almost three times higher than the state average. Niggers is crazy out here. Poverty puts an added stress on families here. Many of these kids have a parent caught up in addiction, or in jail, or no parents at all. Without strong parental protection, teenagers can become vulnerable to the power of street gangs. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN Bloods, crisp. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Latin King, MS-18. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN TRG, outlaw. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Last time, there was shooting and a little kid got dead. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN My name is sergeant James Atkins. I'm a supervisor at Chelsea police gang unit. There's a lot of robberies and assaults that we deal with on a daily basis, the most recent being a 14-year-old kid who got shot while he was standing at the bus stop. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Want some of me, boy? 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN I'll take you both; I'll take you both. 

00:59:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON In Chelsea about seven gangs rule the streets, terrorizing teenage boys in particular. Their lives become filled with fear and anxiety. 

00:59:20
UNKNOWN Kick ass today! 

00:59:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON But they keep it a shameful secret because they want to appear strong. 

00:59:30
GEOFFREY CANADA This gang issue to me is one of the real tragedies in America. 

00:59:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON I met with Geoffrey Canada, one of America's leading activists on children and violence. His shattering autobiography, fist stick knife gun, recounts his own terrified childhood spent running from the gangs in the south Bronx. 

00:59:55
GEOFFREY CANADA This is the deal: teenagers 15 and 16 and 17 have figured out that you can, by hurting a small number of kids, control a huge number of kids, and fear will make kids join and then hurt other kids that then perpetuates this same sort of recruiting strategy. Boys are so terrified that they are willing to almost do anything to avoid being beaten and humiliated, and that is happening in America all the time. And part of the reason it's so powerful is boys don't come in and talk to us about that level of fear and humiliation. There is no adult that they know to go to. 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN Right. Sam, Sam, go get 'em, go get 'em. 

01:00:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Our boys need our help. They need protection from a dangerous, violent street culture. They need nurturing from caring, responsible adults. In Chelsea one place they can come is the Boys and Girls Club. 

01:01:00
SAM HEALY We always worry about kids who are on the fence and think about ways as a staff to try to, ah, connect with them and talk about how they're doing. 

01:01:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Sam Healy is the chief social worker here. A big part of his job is teaching these boys how to talk about their feelings instead of lashing out. 

01:01:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Now, boys don't traditionally sit down and crack open for adults, not boys of this age. 

01:01:25
SAM HEALY No, you gotta use sports, you gotta use a game of chess, you gotta take them to a basketball game. You can get the highs and lows in a basketball game and help kids work on managing the highs and lows. 

01:01:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Healy knows that his best opportunities for teaching come with younger boys. 

01:01:50
[sil.] 

01:01:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON So you're getting your little therapeutic moments here and there in a basketball game. 

01:02:00
SAM HEALY Yeah, yeah, you get to use that moment to teach the skills, ah, to manage their frustration, how to deal with frustration. 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN He hit me by accident I know it was by accident 

01:02:10
SAM HEALY Well, I gotta tell you, you know what's great? A couple months ago you would have run after him, right? You didn't go after him, right? Good job. 

01:02:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's a hell of a job, Sam. 

01:02:25
SAM HEALY But, look at this. I get to play with kids all day. I get to play basketball. I get to play chess. I get to work with joyous kids. To me, it's not even a job. It's-- I love my work, you know. I love my work. 

01:02:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yeah, it shows. 

01:02:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON All boys try to behave like men. To shape themselves into adults, they need raw material in the form of strong, adult male role models. But in places like Chelsea, that's tough. More than a third of the households here are fatherless. When boys don't get the right material to work with, they'll grab whatever they can find. I asked a group of boys at the club who their main male role model was. 

01:03:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON I want to go around. Who's the most important man in your life? Austin, you don't have a dad around. No. So he's not a factor in your life. Who's the man in your life who models respect for you? 

01:03:25
AUSTIN My coach. 

01:03:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Your coach. 

01:03:25
AUSTIN Yeah, my lacrosse coach. 

01:03:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Tell me about him. 

01:03:30
AUSTIN Uhm, he's like-- he always, like, tells me things to do, like, the right way instead of the wrong way. And he-- he's a good influence. 

01:03:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON How long has he been in your life? 

01:03:40
AUSTIN Uhm, 6, 7 years. 

01:03:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Wow. Is there a man in your life who teaches you respect? Lewis. 

01:03:50
LEWIS My mom. 

01:03:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Your mom's the center of your life? 

01:03:55
LEWIS Yeah. 

01:04:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON And you don't have a man in your life who's taught you? 

01:04:00
LEWIS I don't have-- I don't know my dad. I haven't known him for very long. 

01:04:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON How has that hurt your life? 

01:04:05
LEWIS Because my mom always has to take care of us, and my mom-- my dad's never around, only when he needs something. 

01:04:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Does it mean your mom's the more responsible parent? 

01:04:15
LEWIS Yeah. 

01:04:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON She has to earn the money to support you? Would you tease another boy about if he'd actually lost a parent? 

01:04:25
LEWIS No. That's wrong. 

01:04:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON That's wrong? 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:04:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON But boys insult each other's mothers. 

01:04:30
UNKNOWN Your mamma's so fat she has to iron her pants in the driveway. 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN Your mom's so fat she puts lipstick on with a paint roller. 

01:04:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Now, why do boys do that? Why do boys go after each other's mothers? 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN We all know everybody has a mom, and we don't know if everybody has a dad, so it's easier. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN We don't know if everybody has a mom actually, idiot. 

01:04:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Look around does everybody here have a mom? 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN No. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN I do. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN I do. 

01:05:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Do you-- and looking around do you know how many guys here have a dad? 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN I have a dad. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN I have a dad. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN I ain't got one! 

01:05:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON What do you make of it, that men don't stay with their families so much? 

01:05:10
CARRINGTON The mom kicks them out of the houses. 

01:05:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON The moms kick the dads out? Yeah. And Carrington, what do they kick them out for? 

01:05:15
ANTHONY Getting drunk and doing stupid stuff outside. 

01:05:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Anthony, do you yearn to have a dad? 

01:05:20
ANTHONY Sometimes I think about it, you know. When I was younger, I would think about it then, you know. I see, like, my friends, you know. They're going to the pizza shop or something like that. That used to, like, bother me a lot, but I got over it. 

01:05:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON You got over it, finally? You just kind of talked yourself out of it. 

01:05:35
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:05:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hugo, who's the most important man in your life? 

01:05:40
HUGO Me. 

01:05:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON You're how old? 

01:05:45
HUGO Sixteen. 

01:05:45
Hugo 

01:05:45
HUGO Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out! You only find this in the projects. Project production... 

01:05:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON We asked Hugo if he'd be willing to take one of our video cameras and film a bit of his life story for us. 

01:06:00
HUGO He's crazy! About to jump off! 

01:06:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Here's a night out on the streets. Hugo's behind the camera interviewing his friends. 

01:06:10
UNKNOWN I got it! 

01:06:10
HUGO What do you gotta say to the fans back home? 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN Y'all! 

01:06:15
HUGO Crazy bastard. 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN I'm in a class by myself. You niggas trash. We did it in the past, but now he licks ass. Holla, nigger. Is that mother fucker (inaudible ). Go, go, go! 

01:06:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Their swaggering and swearing is designed to shock and intimidate, but it's really just 16-year-old boys doing their thing, getting together to beat their chests. 

01:06:40
UNKNOWN I do any drug in the book. If you don't like it, nigga, bitch. 

01:06:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON There's a name for this fierce pose: the mask of masculinity. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN This boy right here, doin' bad at the age of 14... 

01:06:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON The important thing to remember is that it's only a mask. 

01:07:00
Geoffrey Canada Author and Activist 

01:07:00
GEOFFREY CANADA So much of what they learn to do is posture, right? You identify with the aggressor. How do the toughest kids look? Let me look like that. How do the toughest kids act? Let me act like that. 

01:07:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Do you think America's scared of its boys? 

01:07:15
GEOFFREY CANADA I think America's terrified of these boys. They got all the posturing and they got all the stuff and they're sitting there look-- And you know, these are just scared boys trying to tell the world, don't mess with me. 

01:07:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON This mask of masculinity is a distorted grab at manhood. To be like the father that all boys hunger for. What's behind the mask? Almost always, it's sadness. 

01:07:45
[music] 

01:07:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON For Hugo, home life is very different from his life on the street. 

01:07:55
HUGO This is my home. Been here for 16 years. Home is where the heart is. 

01:08:05
[music] 

01:08:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hugo never knew his father. His mother, a gang member, abandoned him as an infant. 

01:08:15
HUGO Birth mother left me when I was, like, 2 days old. Feel sorry for her. Because, you know, she missed out on me growing up where she missed all the good times and all the bad times. She can't get that back. You know, there's, there's nothing she can do to repay me back for all the years that she missed. 

01:08:35
UNKNOWN She didn't want him. She told me to take him, take care of him. 

01:08:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hugo is being raised by his grandmother, whom he calls mom, and they both care for Hugo's young nieces, abandoned by his stepsister. 

01:08:55
UNKNOWN Maria! 

01:08:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON As the older male in their life, Hugo is the only father they know. 

01:09:05
HUGO She drew that for me. My niece drew that for me. Thank you. 

01:09:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON But he's never had a father to learn from. 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN Hugo, I don't want those candles on. 

01:09:15
HUGO Go to bed. Go to bed, Maria. 

01:09:15
UNKNOWN I don't want those candles on. 

01:09:15
HUGO Oh, well. 

01:09:20
UNKNOWN Nana's gonna get mad at you. 

01:09:20
HUGO Oh, well. 

01:09:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON He isn't able to appreciate a small child's fear of fire. 

01:09:25
UNKNOWN Girl's a pain in the ass. 

01:09:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON But he's doing the best he can. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN He's about to fight! Let me see the other contender. Let me see the other contender. 

01:09:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Hugo tells me that boys in his neighborhood organize fights all the time. 

01:09:45
UNKNOWN We already got a fight in here! 

01:09:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Tonight, he's taping one such fight in a playground near his building. It's a match between two 9-year-old's orchestrated by older boys. The big boys coach the contenders, first holding them back, goading them, and riling them up. 

01:10:05
UNKNOWN I'm not gonna let you go! Game! Beast. 

01:10:10
UNKNOWN One on the middle. I got one right there and there. 

01:10:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Finally, they're set upon each other. 

01:10:15
UNKNOWN Just swing! Hurry up! 

01:10:15
UNKNOWN One, two, three! Aah! Aah! 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:10:25
UNKNOWN One, two, three. 

01:10:30
UNKNOWN He made him cry! 

01:10:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON I'll bet that almost every man can remember a frightening scene like this from his childhood, only this fight is especially urgent and violent. 

01:10:45
UNKNOWN Ohh! Knocked out! Knocked out! 

01:10:50
UNKNOWN I got it! 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN Woo-hoo! 

01:10:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Geoffrey Canada remembers it vividly as survival training. 

01:11:00
GEOFFREY CANADA You are humiliated and ridiculed. They would hit you as hard as they could with the express purpose of making you cry to expose the hidden weakness, which we all were, at that point, desperate to try and hide from. 

01:11:20
UNKNOWN Who do you think won the fight? What was the scorecards? 

01:11:25
GEOFFREY CANADA And I would sit there and think, "there's something wrong with this picture. I mean, this hurts." But later I understood it was their job to prepare us for what we were going to face when we left our block, because when you left your block, the kids had no mercy on you. 

01:11:40
[music] 

01:11:45
HUGO I'm just wakin' up. Mom's yelling at me. I'm exhausted. I went home, like, around 3 o'clock last night. 

01:12:00
UNKNOWN Getting up in the morning, that's his bad, um-- I don't know how to say that but, ah... 

01:12:05
HUGO Lazy. 

01:12:05
UNKNOWN He's lazy, yeah. 

01:12:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON In spite of his late night, Hugo still gets his nieces ready, as he does every morning. 

01:12:15
HUGO I learn things about how, how raising kids--you gotta be, like, nice, like, gentle with them and everything. Takes time, time and patience to raise kids. 

01:12:25
HUGO I need a taxi to 230 Central Ave. 

01:12:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Since there is no car, the family commutes every day by taxi. First they'll drop off Hugo's grandmother at her work, then the taxi will take Hugo And his nieces to their day care. The trip makes Hugo chronically late for school. 

01:12:55
HUGO I wanna go to college 'cause I wanna do somethin' with my life. I don't wanna be, like, another lowlife, asking for quarters on the corner. Hopefully, graduate from college with a basketball scholarship. That's how I wanna go. And go to law school become a lawyer. Because I love to argue, and I always win. So I think I'd be good at that. 

01:13:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON To make his dreams come true, Hugo's going to have to overcome odds that are heavily stacked against him. And he's carrying a tremendous amount of pain and loss. Hugo is raising himself in a vacuum. It's just not right to ask a boy to be a man before he's ready without training, with no support. 

01:13:55
HUGO Go. 

01:13:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON And the fact is, we're raising a generation of Hugos. Forty percent of American boys live in homes without a biological father. America, in fact, leads the industrialized world in fatherlessness. 

01:14:15
[music] 

01:14:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON For Hugo and many other teenagers, that makes their local Boys and Girls Club an even more important place. But even here, the problems of the streets have a way of intruding. When I visit the club one morning, something is clearly up. There was a sleepover last night. Apparently, some of the boys broke into the director's office and stole over $1,000 worth of donated football tickets. Sam and Josh, the club's director, quickly figure out which kids did it. Two of them have run off, but the third has stayed behind. 

01:15:05
Renato 

01:15:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's Renato, 16 years old and a leader in the club. 

01:15:15
SAM HEALY When your name was brought up, it was like, "oh, god, no, he was doing really well." 

01:15:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON When first confronted, he denies everything. 

01:15:20
JOSH I just want the truth. 

01:15:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Later he admits being in the room during the incident, but claims he didn't steal any tickets. 

01:15:30
RENATO While I was in the office, I was, I think we should leave, we should leave. But I don't know, they just wanted to stay. So we just left after a while. But I just follow them. 

01:15:35
SAM HEALY Now two of those guys can't come back here at all. 

01:15:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Josh and Sam have given up on the other two boys. But Renato is a different story. 

01:15:45
SAM HEALY So we not only care for you, but we care about the rest of the kids in the club, you know, and like, how are you gonna be and how that affects the whole community. 

01:15:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON They know that Renato needs a firm consequence for his action, But they also worry about him. So far, he's managed to stay clear of gangs, but some of his friends are ganged up and pressuring him to join. 

01:16:10
JOSH Renato's a good kid, but now that he's getting a little older, we're, ah, we're very concerned about losing him to the neighborhood, the more negative influences in the neighborhood. 

01:16:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Negative influences like Renato's best friend, Bryant. He was kicked out of the Boys and Girls Club 6 months ago. Since then he's been convicted of a gang-related assault and is serving a 2-month sentence. 

01:16:35
BRYANT On the streets it's different, man. You gotta be like an animal. If somebody says something stupid, boom - just gotta hit 'em up. 

01:16:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Bryant has given himself over to the gang version of manhood. Josh and Sam fear that if they suspend Renato, he'll become more vulnerable to the influence of friends like Bryant. 

01:16:55
SAM HEALY You know, and so our concern's, like, who's he gonna be? You have so much talent. You have so much to give. So you can be, like, that negative leader or a positive leader, that's your choice. 

01:17:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Reluctantly, they reach a decision. They're suspending Renato for 2 months. When I catch up with Renato on the bench outside, he's ready to write off the club altogether. 

01:17:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Is this going to change your relationship with the Boys and Girls Club? 

01:17:25
RENATO Yeah, I don't think I'm going to come here no more. 

01:17:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Really? 

01:17:30
RENATO Yeah. 

01:17:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Because that's it for you, getting accused of something that-- 

01:17:35
RENATO If they handled it a different way it would have been different. But they just hopped on us. Like yeah, you did it, you did it. What the hell? How can you do that? That's stupid. 

01:17:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Do you feel insulted? Do you also feel a little scared? 

01:17:50
RENATO Nope. Why should I be scared if I know I didn't do it. 

01:17:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON A boy will almost always lie when first confronted with an unpleasant truth. Boys, more than girls, are deeply sensitive to being shamed. And I believe Renato is trying to avoid that emotion at all costs. Sullen silence is another way boys protect themselves. 

01:18:10
GEOFFREY CANADA Author and Activist 

01:18:15
GEOFFREY CANADA You know, I tell parents, after boys get about 12, 13, they don't-- everything is no, yes. They don't talk to you anymore, right? And so you're really cut out of their world, and as a parent, you're not afraid of that kid. But when you don't know who that kid is, and you're sitting there, "You have it? "No, I don't have it." The kid is turned away. I mean, that-- people are afraid to then approach that boy and say, "Excuse me, please look at me when i talk to you. I'm really trying to help you." They won't do that. They won't make that approach. And if you do that, you can reconnect with a lot of these kids. 

01:18:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON To try and open a connection with Renato, I ask him to guide me on a tour of his neighborhood. 

01:18:50
RENATO I'm going to show you to my street. My street is the worst in Chelsea. 

01:18:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Your street is the worst in Chelsea. What makes it the worst? 

01:19:00
RENATO 'Cause that's where, that's where the gangs' at, the crack, and all that. 

01:19:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON All right. Take me there. 

01:19:05
RENATO It looks nice, right? 

01:19:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yes, it does look nice. 

01:19:10
RENATO In the summertime, horrible; nighttime, bad. See these people right here? 

01:19:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yeah. 

01:19:15
RENATO Crackheads. 

01:19:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON This just looks like a bus stop to me. 

01:19:20
RENATO Yeah, it is. Bunch of crackheads, you see all over the place. 

01:19:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON As Renato guides me past one danger spot after anger, I realize he's beginning to open up. He's taking me on a tour of his fears. 

01:19:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Would you walk here on your own? 

01:19:45
RENATO No. No. 

01:19:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Not under any circumstances? 

01:19:45
RENATO No. 

01:19:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON What would you be afraid of? 

01:19:50
RENATO Gettin' jumped. A little kid got killed here. 

01:19:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON A little kid got killed? 

01:19:55
RENATO Yeah. 

01:19:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON Renato's world is a frightening place, indeed. It makes perfect sense to me that a boy would want to seek whatever kind of safety he could even the illusory protection of a gang. Maybe that's what led his friend Bryant to join a gang. 

01:20:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Renato, tell me about Bryant. I mean, why is he in detention? 

01:20:20
RENATO He's a gangbanger. Take a left at this corner. 

01:20:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON A few days later, I'm able to pay Bryant a visit. He describes his present circumstances, caught up in violence and the penal system, as if they were a conscious career choice. 

01:20:40
BRYANT Everybody got their own lifestyle. That's what their own lifestyle. That's what I do. Some people like being a chef. They cook. I like to bang. 

01:20:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON As I listened to Bryant, I can't help but feel that he's lost. He's crossed over a line, and he isn't looking back. 

01:21:00
BRYANT I got street credibility. Everybody knows me. Nobody can pull my cards. Ain't no cards you can pull on me. I got a good life. I like my life. Ain't nothing wrong being like me. 

01:21:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Bryant is selling an image of man as a gangster, an image that he was sold. It is, of course, a phony bill of goods. And boys like Renato are his potential customers. If we want to save them, we need to offer a better model of manhood than the one Bryant's pushing. 

01:21:40
GEOFFREY CANADA We've got to get men as role models in these boys' lives because I think it's critical that boys see men doing the kinds of things we want those boys to do for their own children-- wiping their noses, holding their hands, taking them across the street, helping them with their homework-- all of that stuff that is against, sort of, the modern mythology of maleness. He's cool and a caretaker. That's right. If I get someone from down the block who comes here who's in college, who's working, who is not afraid, able to walk around the community, you know, is able to keep some status, and still comes to help other boys in a way that shows caring and compassion, I think that's the way we're going to get boys to start learning what it really means to be a man. 

01:22:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Redefining what manhood is. 

01:22:25
GEOFFREY CANADA That's right. 

01:22:35
[music] 

01:22:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON The day after his suspension ends, Renato's back at the club, ready to resume his role as a regular. Sam and Josh are thrilled to see him and remain cautiously optimistic about his chances. Still, the pull of gang culture is insidious. In an unguarded moment, Renato flashes a gang sign to our camera. His relationship with that world is still unresolved. But along with the Renatos and Bryants, there are also boys here whose lives are taking a hopeful turn in spite of very troubled beginnings. 

01:23:25
P.J. 

01:23:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON P.J. has had a history of violent, angry outbursts. 

01:23:30
SAM HEALY Social Worker 

01:23:35
SAM HEALY When I first met P.J. at 8 years old, He was an explosive kid who was just, um, difficult to manage. Maybe it's chemical or maybe it's learned, I don't know, but he was, uhm, you know, a restraint waiting to happen. 

01:23:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON I asked P.J. if he'd be willing to go for a walk. I'd like to talk if that's all right. 

01:23:55
P.J. All right. 

01:23:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON You had some problems in school? 

01:23:55
P.J. Um, yes, I did. Like when I was younger, I could, like-- I would get, like, mad very easily. 

01:24:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Whatever it was, you. 

01:24:05
P.J. I would get mad, yeah. 

01:24:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON For a 13-year-old, P.J. is surprisingly articulate about his history. 

01:24:15
P.J. They would call three or four janitors or security guards, and they'd restrain me. 

01:24:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON You're in second grade and it's taking three janitors to restrain you? 

01:24:20
P.J. Because I would kick and I would punch and I'd snap at them to bite them. 

01:24:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Were you ever suspended? 

01:24:25
P.J. I practically set the record for the most suspensions in the Hook school. 

01:24:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON You did? 

01:24:30
P.J. Yes. 

01:24:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON P.J.'s reputation for aggression tends to drive away potential friends. 

01:24:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Do you think there are some kids who are still a little scared of you? 

01:24:40
P.J. I don't know if they're scared, but I would say kids that know me from the past, they'll be nice to me, but it's not out of that they wanna be friends with me. They just don't wanna - 

01:24:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Mess with you. 

01:24:50
P.J. - have trouble with me. 

01:24:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON You're a little lonely, aren't you, P.J.? 

01:24:55
P.J. Yeah. 

01:25:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Boys like P.J. are at great risk. If their behavioral problems lead to failure at school and rejection by peers. They can get trapped in a vicious cycle of depression, rage, and isolation. 

01:25:15
GEOFFREY CANADA See, it's this sort of reinforcing thing. They act a certain way, the adults pull back. The adults see them acting that way, they pull back, and both people think there's a gulf so big there, that you can't breach it, and so these kids live in isolated fear and anxiety with no one, really, to talk to. 

01:25:30
GILDA RAMIREZ P, it's time to get up. 

01:25:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON There are some ways to break the cycle. It's hard work, but parents can do it - 

01:25:40
GILDA RAMIREZ P.J. 

01:25:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON - if they stay actively engaged with their sons. 

01:25:40
GILDA RAMIREZ It's 6:30; it's not early. 

01:25:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON P.J. told me that his parents divorced when he was 1 year old. 

01:25:50
GILDA RAMIREZ Do you know what you're wearing today? 

01:25:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON He now lives with his mother, Gilda, and his half brother and sister. 

01:25:55
GILDA RAMIREZ You gotta hurry up; don't take forever. 

01:26:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Gilda holds down a full-time job as a paralegal. Every morning, she has her hands full trying to get everyone out the door on time. 

01:26:05
GILDA RAMIREZ It's picture day at school. Yes, baby? 

01:26:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Her concerns about P.J. started when he entered preschool. 

01:26:15
GILDA RAMIREZ P.J.'s Mom 

01:26:15
GILDA RAMIREZ His anger was out of control. He would really express feelings of especially hurting himself, and that worried me. I mean, I didn't sleep, you know? And, uhm, it was really, really a tough time. 

01:26:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Gilda pushed hard to get P.J. professional attention. He began meeting with a team of teachers and counselors for a series of evaluations. Their diagnosis: ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

01:26:55
GILDA RAMIREZ Did you finish your homework yesterday? 

01:26:55
P.J. Yeah. 

01:27:00
GILDA RAMIREZ That's weird 'cause I could swear I didn't see you doing homework. P.J., did you take your pill? 

01:27:05
P.J. When I turned 8 or 9, they gave me prescriptions for, like, Adderall, that I'm taking now. 

01:27:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON You're on Adderall? 

01:27:15
P.J. Yeah. 

01:27:15
GILDA RAMIREZ P.J. Started taking pills, and within 2 weeks, I saw the difference. 

01:27:20
P.J. When I was in second grade, I was gettin', like, Fs on all my report cards. Once I started using medication, I was gettin' Bs and Cs. And I've gotten, like, honor rolls over the years. It would, like, help me concentrate better, and I would be able to focus. Like, on things that would normally get me angry, I'd be able to focus on, like, what's happening. 

01:27:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON P.J.'s turnaround has been remarkable, and medication has certainly played a role. But so did counseling and his deeply involved mother, who refused to give up on her son. 

01:28:00
P.J. I love you. 

01:28:00
GILDA RAMIREZ Love you, too. 

01:28:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON And there's been another constant, loving presence in P.J.'s life. 

01:28:10
P.J. Hey, dad. 

01:28:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Every other weekend, P.J. stays at his father's apartment. 

01:28:20
PEDRO FIGUEROA I got the, ah, strawberry ones you like. Yeah. I'll put some in a cup for you. 

01:28:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Pedro Sr. remained close by the family after the divorce, and he also remained deeply committed to having a real relationship with his son. 

01:28:35
PEDRO FIGUEROA P.J.'s Dad 

01:28:35
PEDRO FIGUEROA I, being from a divorced home, was, ah, you know, somewhat neglected by my father and whatnot in the sense that I didn't see him. What I really wanted from my dad was his love and his affection and his companionship. 

01:28:50
PEDRO FIGUEROA P.J., your feet are huge. 

01:28:50
P.J. I know. 

01:28:55
PEDRO FIGUEROA It looks like you're gonna be at least a 12 or more. 

01:28:55
P.J. As long as they don't keep calling me clown feet, I'm all right. 

01:29:00
PEDRO FIGUEROA They call you clown feet? 

01:29:05
P.J. Yeah, my coaches. 

01:29:05
PEDRO FIGUEROA So that's why I go out of my way to make sure that I'm there for him, even I'm not be able to give him riches because I'm not a rich man. 

01:29:10
PEDRO FIGUEROA When I was your age, everybody used to tell me I had BoBo shoes, 'cause BoBo was the famous clown back then. That's funny. 

01:29:20
PEDRO FIGUEROA So I give him my love, I give him my attention, I give him my time, and I give him my friendship. 

01:29:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Pedro Sr. is giving his son a precious gift: a model of manhood that includes the open expression of affection. This is something all boys need and what all fathers can give. 

01:29:45
[music] 

01:29:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Angry, aggressive boys like P.J. are too often just labeled as problems and left to slip through the cracks. P.J. was saved simply because people in his life cared enough to pay attention. His parents remain committed. 

01:30:10
GILDA RAMIREZ That's okay! 

01:30:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Even putting aside their differences to come to his football games. 

01:30:15
GILDA RAMIREZ Even though it's a lot of work for the parents-- you know, I work full-time so I get outta work, I run and pick up the kids and, you know, run them back to the practice. But they're busy. It's gonna pay off. 

01:30:20
PEDRO FIGUEROA That's one thing you wanna do in the inner city is always try to keep 'em busy. Instead of hangin' out on the corner. I know my son is at practice. He's playin' football. He's doin' positive things. 

01:30:30
GILDA RAMIREZ What more can you ask of your child, you know? He's a really good boy. 

01:30:40
PEDRO FIGUEROA We're very proud of him. 

01:30:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON P.J.'s story is, unfortunately, a rare one in the inner city, where poverty, fatherlessness, and crime add stress to the life of teenage boys. In the wealthy suburbs, these kinds of stresses don't enter the lives of teenagers. 

01:31:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON How many of you guys come from intact families, undi-- non-divorced families? All of you. How many of you feel you've ever been traumatized by some-- seeing some violence? 

01:31:10
UNKNOWN We live in, we live in Sudbury and Lincoln, Massachusetts. I mean, they're two pretty well-developed suburbs of Boston that-- we grew up, like, hanging out having a good time. We don't grow up seeing people getting knifed in, like, back alleys. 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN Oh, nothing! 

01:31:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON But even in the suburbs, adolescence is a risky time, because all 17 and 18-year-old boys are desperately looking for ways to prove that they're men to adults and especially to each other. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN I'm being a reporter right now. 

01:31:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON And even though they may look like men, psychologically they're still boys, and they still need our guidance. 

01:32:00
UNKNOWN Oooh! What the hell was that? 

01:32:00
UNKNOWN Do not do anything I wouldn't do. 

01:32:05
[music] 

01:32:20
JIMMY Tuesday morning. Time to get up for school. 6:42. And I am not at all awake or prepared to get up this early. 

01:32:35
[music] 

01:32:35
Jimmy 

01:32:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Jimmy's parents gave him this car so he could drive himself to school. He's asked his friend Chris to videotape him on the way. 

01:32:50
CHRIS So, James, how old are you? 

01:32:55
JIMMY I am 17, and I will be 18 on May 2nd. 

01:32:55
CHRIS What do you look for in an attractive young lady that you wish to date? 

01:33:00
JIMMY Gotta be easy on the eyes. And, as Jan always says, gotta be a good kisser. 

01:33:10
CHRIS And Jan, for the people who don't know who Jan is? 

01:33:10
JIMMY Janice would be my mother. A shot of the brand-new is school that costs a whopping $72 million dollars. 

01:33:25
[music] 

01:33:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Jimmy and his friends are seniors, the year when all the pressure crescendos. 

01:33:35
UNKNOWN Four hundred Newton force pulling this way. Okay, and I'm gonna pass out the quiz. 

01:33:45
JIMMY Lincoln-Sudbury has a reputation of being a good school, and everybody wants to do well. Everybody's parents wants them to do well. And especially now with the whole college thing, there's usually tension among families. 

01:34:00
JIMMY So, mom, how do you feel about the college essay process? 

01:34:00
UNKNOWN I wish we'd thought of one universal essay that you could have used. 

01:34:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Parents often get frustrated by teenage sons who seem so prepared for manhood one moment and so ill-prepared the next. 

01:34:15
JIMMY The online thing for Yukon isn't working. It's just this ridiculous responsibility that comes out of nowhere, and you're trying to prepare yourself for the rest of your life. Everybody is trying to help you, but you don't know what you want. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN You're sure you checked early decision? 

01:34:35
JIMMY Yeah, I'm sure I checked it. What does that even mean? 

01:34:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON Of course, we all want to encourage our teenage sons to do their best academically. 

01:34:50
JIMMY And we just took a quiz on both kinetic friction and static friction. And I probably made, I don't know, one little mistake. So I'll probably get a 90. 

01:35:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON But getting good grades is not an accurate measure of emotional maturity. Neither is athletic success. But all too often, if a boy is doing well in school and sports, we assume that his inner life is untroubled. 

01:35:15
JOHN RITCHIE Principal 

01:35:15
JOHN RITCHIE The difference between appearance and reality can be pretty profound. And I think every kid is under a lot of pressure these days. I think it's a tremendously heavy burden that they all bear. I think boys just feel such pressure to be men, to be tough, to be, ah, stoic. 

01:35:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Jimmy is not only a good student, he's also captain of the high-school football team. They're preparing for the big Thanksgiving Day game against archival, Newton South. 

01:35:45
TOM LOPEZ Coach 

01:35:50
TOM LOPEZ Thanksgiving's a big day in Massachusetts. Traditional rivals. They're a good team. We're a good team. Hopefully, we play a little bit better. It's a culminating experience for the seniors, so we hope they go out with a win. 

01:36:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Now, these guys certainly look like men, and most of them want to believe they're men. 

01:36:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Are you a man now? 

01:36:10
UNKNOWN Um, I feel I'm a man now. 

01:36:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:36:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:36:15
UNKNOWN I consider myself a young man, I guess. 

01:36:20
UNKNOWN Close, yeah, I'd say. 

01:36:25
KOBY I don't think so. 

01:36:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON Actually, new research confirms what Koby's saying. Most 18-year-old's are not adults. Their brains aren't fully developed. The frontal lobe, which controls judgment, is still maturing. 

01:36:40
KOBY Jimmy's Friend 

01:36:45
KOBY When I'm going out and I'm, like, mom, I'm going to Sudbury. I'll be home tomorrow morning. And she's, like okay, like, be safe. And I'm, like, yeah, all right, whatever. 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN Waaah! 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN Who told their parents they we're going (inaudible )? 

01:36:58
UNKNOWN I did. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN I did. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN I told my parents we were going to play snow football or something. We were going to play out in the snow. That's all I said. 

01:37:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON Most people think the leading cause of death among teenage boys is criminal violence. It isn't. It's accidents. 

01:37:20
UNKNOWN Stop! 

01:37:25
KOBY Only the good die young. 

01:37:30
UNKNOWN Oh, my god! 

01:37:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON This tape reveals a side of teenagers' lives that most parents don't get to see. 

01:37:40
UNKNOWN Oh, my god! 

01:37:40
UNKNOWN This is nuts. 

01:37:40
UNKNOWN Careful, careful, careful!! Oh, damn it! Great-- work! Two inches! 

01:37:50
UNKNOWN Look at where your tire is! Look at where your tire is in relation to the telephone pole! 

01:37:55
KOBY Our little bumper-riding incident-- obviously we won't tell them about stuff like that. I mean, I almost crashed the car, so hopefully they will never find out. Right. 

01:38:15
UNKNOWN Tell me to stop if my bumper's about to fall off. 

01:38:20
UNKNOWN Is it in neutral? 

01:38:25
UNKNOWN Yes! 

01:38:25
UNKNOWN Oh, baby! 

01:38:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, baby, yeah! That was awesome! 

01:38:30
UNKNOWN Yo, this is easily the best idea we've ever had. 

01:38:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Yes, this behavior is scary and it is reckless, so why do they do it? Because they're looking for ways to test their manhood. 

01:38:45
UNKNOWN Is this the exclusive group? 

01:38:50
UNKNOWN Uh, yeah. 

01:38:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON And one other test is sexual. 

01:38:55
UNKNOWN Adam! 

01:38:55
UNKNOWN Some anger from Kara, very sexy anger! 

01:38:55
UNKNOWN Adam. 

01:39:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON At this age, their bodies are flooded with up to seven shots of testosterone a day. 

01:39:05
UNKNOWN Earthquake! 

01:39:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON And what do they see all around them? Seductive images of women in rap videos, television, and internet porn. These messages cause enormous confusion for boys. 

01:39:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON How many of you have seen porn on the internet? show many of you have seen porn on the internet more than 30 times? Okay. 

01:39:35
UNKNOWN My parents caught me in fourth grade. 

01:39:40
MICHAEL THOMPSON Your parents caught you in fourth grade? 

01:39:40
UNKNOWN Me and two of my friends from private school slept over at my house, and this kid, Jeff, he brought us to some sites and we were all sitting there kind of wide-eyed. And then my parents found it on the history of the internet a couple days later and asked me about it, and I denied everything and put all blame on my friends. 

01:40:00
UNKNOWN You said like a Pokemon or something? 

01:40:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:40:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON How many of you had a meaningful talk with your parents about sexuality? 

01:40:05
UNKNOWN I've had, like, the talk, you know, the one, like, the penis goes in the vagina. 

01:40:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON No kidding! Yeah, Koby, tell me about the talk. Wait, is this with your dad or your mom? 

01:40:20
KOBY Both. They ambushed me in my room. They have two condoms, and they gave them to me, and they're, like, "Koby, if you need these, use them. Don't you have unprotected sex," like, safe sex, all that. Then we talked for, like, 15 minutes. I kind of sit there. It was really awkward. We've never really had, like, a deep conversation about what it means or-- it was a couple years ago. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN I remember we were just at the dinner table and they'll drop a comment, "You know you have to be safe, right?" And he'll, like-- he'll start laughing inside of mouth. I have to be safe, right? And then I'm, like, yeah, dad. Then all of us just start dying. I get, I get all the real stuff from school, probably. 

01:41:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON All the real stuff from school? 

01:41:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON If parents can't bring themselves to talk with their sons about sex, it may become hard for boys to judge what's appropriate and what's not. And that can create real problems. 

01:41:20
UNKNOWN Yeah!! 

01:41:25
SENIOR DRESS-UP DAY 

01:41:30
JOHN RITCHIE Every Halloween we have this tradition called dress-up day. The seniors dress up in elaborate outfits. Boys tend to dress as girls in very skimpy outfits, and girls tend to dress as hookers and prostitutes. 

01:41:50
[music] 

01:41:55
JOHN RITCHIE I'm running the show, and it's terrifying, because I'm both watching the crowd, watching the clock, trying to fit in all the groups, trying to make sure nothing goes over the line. 

01:42:05
JIMMY For senior dress-up day, my friends and I decided to do a reenactment of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, where we had one of our friends who's skinnier than the rest of us be Snow White, and things got blown out of proportion. 

01:42:30
[music] 

01:42:40
JOHN RITCHIE I just sort of saw a bunch of movement over there and dancing and after awhile, I hit the gong. Because I had another act to get on. And went away for the weekend-- it was Friday-- thinking, great, we got through another dress-up day. Nobody got killed. Nobody's going to be angry at me. Got back Sunday night and checked the e-mails. It was just flooded with people who were just outraged at what these kids did, seeing it as a simulated rape or gangbang. 

01:43:05
UNKNOWN If I was an outsider and I saw it, I would be offended by it. 

01:43:10
UNKNOWN Yes, that was in form of tease like they should have thought out their skit better, but it really wasn't offensive. 

01:43:15
UNKNOWN In pass years if you had seen the other stuff people had done, there's been some pretty bad ones. So I just think they wanted, they wanted to be remembered. 

01:43:20
UNKNOWN That's basically just a simulation of what we see on TV. 

01:43:25
JOHN RITCHIE So this sort of raged through the school for 2 weeks with people demanding action and other people defending them. And I got a call from a resident saying, I heard there was a gang rape at the school last week. 

01:43:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Were any of you Snow White or the seven dwarfs? So there was this sort of assault of Snow White? 

01:43:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:43:45
UNKNOWN In that means... 

01:43:45
JIMMY It was supposed to be funny because it was a parody of the original story, and we're-- it's so far from what really happened. 

01:43:55
KOBY There's always, like, inappropriate skits. 

01:43:55
UNKNOWN Sexual under recurrent. 

01:43:55
KOBY Yeah, in the entire d-- it's basically an excuse for girls to dress like sluts and for guys to, like, dress up like girls. 

01:44:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON Do you feel, guys, unjustly accused, like people don't have a sense of humor? And they decide you were the Neanderthal football players? 

01:44:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON Schools typically handle a situation like this in one of two ways: either they suspend the boys outright, or they say, in effect, well, boys will be boys. Neither of these options alone, I believe, serves the best interests of the boys or the school. 

01:44:35
KAREN THOMSEN Teacher 

01:44:35
KAREN THOMSEN I don't think that we just say, oh, well, it's just boys. That's what they do. But I do think that attitude does prevail, not only here, but in society. And I think that we need to look at that, because I think that's damaging not only to the whole community, uhm, but also to-- to the young men. 

01:45:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON Karen invited me to talk to the faculty about the psychology of the boys who performed the skit. 

01:45:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON When I heard about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in the moment they were stimulated. They were in the excitement of it. They thought they were in a tradition, and the tradition was: all senior classes get to be gross. Right? It's a damn tradition. It is offensive; I grant you it's offensive. But it's not announcing that these good guys are all future rapists. Play violence is not violence, and we lose credibility with boys when we think it is, so I separate right away things that are enactments. A symbolic enactment that's play is another message. It tells you, we are under a certain amount of control but we want you to know something about us. 

01:45:50
KAREN THOMSEN What I'd like to ask is, when, when we as educators see these kind of behaviors, how do you think that we should intervene? 

01:46:00
MICHAEL THOMPSON You should intervene in a way that gets the boys to reflect. Find out whether they can see it from somebody else's point of view. 

01:46:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON If we simply condemn boys' behavior when it's shocking and end the discussion there. We risk reinforcing the message that boys get from early on: that their inner lives are scary and shameful. It's far better to use the behavior as the starting point of a conversation about their intentions and feelings. In the end, the school did not punish the boys, because after seeing the reactions of teachers and students, the boys themselves approached the principal. 

01:46:50
JOHN RITCHIE They came to me with a real sincere apology, a sort of sense of shock that this had offended people. And that's a huge learning experience and a much more valuable one than, you know, you get six detentions because you did something that the rules say you shouldn't do. That would have been stupid. They would have been laughing at us. So I just think promoting that kind of dialogue really pays off, though it's painful and hard to measure the results and takes a long time. 

01:47:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON John Ritchie is right. Boys will eventually open up to an adult, but you've got to listen closely. 

01:47:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON When was the last time you cried? 

01:47:25
KOBY The last time I cried was probably my grandfather's funeral. 

01:47:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON Were you very close to him? 

01:47:30
KOBY Yeah, I was-- he-- I liked him a lot. Uhm, and then he passed away. 

01:47:35
MICHAEL THOMPSON Can I ask you a question? You said you liked him a lot. You didn't say, I love him, I loved him a lot. 

01:47:40
KOBY I, I loved him more than... 

01:47:45
MICHAEL THOMPSON I know, but I just-- I know you did. I could tell from your face, but you didn't say it. 

01:47:50
KOBY Yeah. 

01:47:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON Why? 

01:47:50
KOBY I, I don't know. I mean-- I misspoke. 

01:47:55
MICHAEL THOMPSON No, no, you didn't misspeak. You were-- it was a rule, wasn't it? 

01:48:00
KOBY Yeah, that's-- that's true. 

01:48:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON You weren't going to say in front of a whole bunch of guys or in front of me that you loved... 

01:48:10
KOBY Yeah, that's-- I guess you don't really talk about that. Yeah, it's for women. Love makes you weak. Like hearts and flowers and stuff are associated with love and that's not, like, we're out on the football field. It's not about love. It's about, like, hate and anger. 

01:48:25
THANKSGIVING DAY 

01:48:30
UNKNOWN Jimmy, you leaving? 

01:48:30
JIMMY Yeah. 

01:48:30
UNKNOWN I gotta give you a kiss. Come here. It's your last game. Good luck. 

01:48:35
JIMMY Thank you. 

01:48:40
UNKNOWN Don't get hurt. 

01:48:40
JIMMY I won't. 

01:48:45
UNKNOWN I actually was crying when I did his laundry last night, I said, "This is the last time." He's my first; he'll always be my baby. 

01:48:55
JIMMY This game means more than any other game. I can just feel something's different right now. 

01:49:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's the morning of the big game, just a few hours before kickoff. For boys on the edge of manhood, this is much more than a game. It's a rite of passage. 

01:49:20
[music] 

01:49:25
TOM LOPEZ Think about it, seniors. The next time you walk in this locker room, it is over. 

01:49:30
[music] 

01:49:35
TOM LOPEZ If you win the game, you're gonna walk off the field, you're gonna be happy. If Newton South wins the game, all hell's gonna break loose. Screw their celebration. LS on three: one, two, three. 

01:49:50
UNKNOWN LS! 

01:49:50
UNKNOWN Let's go, blue! 

01:49:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON It's an irony of our notion of manhood that only those with impeccable credentials as tough guys can get away with showing their softer side. 

01:50:05
UNKNOWN They were a very close class. They were very supportive of each other since they were in about seventh grade. So I think all of them realizing this is the last time they're suiting up as warriors is gonna make a big difference. 

01:50:20
UNKNOWN I'd like to introduce the senior football players for Lincoln-Sudbury as they recognize their mothers. Number 51, Jason Favio. 

01:50:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON As a psychologist, I watch this ceremony and see nothing about athletics. It's about a mother approving her son moving into manhood. 

01:50:40
UNKNOWN And number 74, Jimmy Lesko. 

01:50:50
UNKNOWN For so many years, this is how we spent our weekends and our Thanksgiving, going there and watching him, and so it's really, for me, it's, it's the moving on that is really touching. 

01:51:05
UNKNOWN The Lincoln-Sudbury football seniors and their mothers. 

01:51:15
UNKNOWN Let the bodies hit the floor! Let the bodies hit the floor! Let the bodies hit the floor! Let the bodies hit the floor! 

01:51:25
MICHAEL THOMPSON The first half is tightly played. Despite LS being favored, the score is tied at halftime. 

01:51:35
TOM LOPEZ Be able to walk off the field, seniors, with your head high, that's all I ask. Don't let somebody else make a play; you make a play! You be the team celebrating at the end of the game. LS on three: one, two, three. 

01:51:45
UNKNOWN Double tight. 

01:51:50
MICHAEL THOMPSON It remains tied into the final minutes. 

01:51:55
TOM LOPEZ Shut up! We gotta gain two yards to make our season, okay? Two goddamn yards. We're gonna run 37 toss. 

01:52:05
MICHAEL THOMPSON They don't get the yardage. 

01:52:10
UNKNOWN We didn't get it. Let's go, defense! 

01:52:15
UNKNOWN No, no! 

01:52:20
MICHAEL THOMPSON Then a series of penalties puts Newton South into field-goal range. Suddenly, it's over. Lincoln-Sudbury loses by three points. The boys thought that today's game would be a test of their manhood. They were right, but not in the way they had imagined. 

01:52:45
JIMMY We worked so hard for the last 4 years, and we just couldn't pull it together this one last time. And we knew that we were capable of so much more, and so that, that left us all feeling kind of empty. 

01:53:05
[music] 

01:53:10
MICHAEL THOMPSON These young men are going to have to prove that they can cope with an immense disappointment. 

01:53:15
JIMMY Everyone, I'm proud to be a part of this team. I like you guys. I love you all. Good year. Here we go: LS on the two, three for the last time, boys great season. 

01:53:25
UNKNOWN Two, three!! 

01:53:25
UNKNOWN LS!! 

01:53:30
MICHAEL THOMPSON People sometimes ask me why girls have deeper friendships than boys. I don't believe that's true. It's just that boys express themselves differently. Today, they showed deep compassion for each other. They've learned that emotional courage is courage. Our job is to help them learn that lesson well. If we can do that for our boys, we'll have guided them a long way on their journey to becoming healthier, happier human beings. 

01:54:10
UNKNOWN Oh, awesome, you guys! 

01:54:15
MICHAEL THOMPSON We began this program by stressing that America's boys are in serious trouble. Over the last 2 hours, we've explored ways that we can address their problems. That effort must start with a better understanding of the psychology of boys. We need to remember that boys, as much as girls, have an emotional life. And that they have their own way of learning, which must be accommodated in the classroom. We need to realize how important it is for boys to have a father or father figure, an adult male who can model manhood and teach boys that there are many ways to be a man and that being a man means being responsible, caring, and emotionally available.
