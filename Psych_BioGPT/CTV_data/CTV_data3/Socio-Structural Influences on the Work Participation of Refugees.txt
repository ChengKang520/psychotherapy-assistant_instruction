GEORGE GUSHEW My name is (ph)George Gushew and I am uh, a member of the faculty here in the uh, counseling program. I'm the director of training for the doctoral program and I have been given the honor and the privilege of presenting or introducing Professor, uh, Elias Mpofu, who will be our next speaker. Um, Professor (ph)Mputinim, Mpofu, is the professor . . . I, I, I believe I did that last time. I'm sorry. Was the professor and head of the discipline of rehabilitation counseling at the University of Sydney, formerly a professor of rehabilitation services at Penn State Dr. Mpofu is a leading researcher, educator on counseling people with disadvantage for ability and survivorship in diverse community settings. His community-oriented research has earned three international awards in rehabilitation research from the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation Research, from the National Counsel on Rehabilitation Education and from the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association, uh, their research award. For his leadership in teaching Professor Mpofu was awarded the Rehabilitation Educator of the Year Award in 2010. Professor Mpofu is the editor of the Australian Journal of Rehab Counseling and the Journal of Psychology in Africa. He also serves on the editorial boards of several rehab counseling-related journals, including the Journal of (ph)Rehabib-, Rehabilitation Administration, Rehabilitation Education, the Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin, Psychological Assessment, and the International Journal of Disability Development in Education. Dr. Mpofu is the lead editor of Assessment and Rehabilitation in Health, which is published by (ph)Pearson, and Rehabilitation and Health Assessment, published by (ph)Springer. He also recently published a seminal, edited book: Counseling People of African Ancestry, published by Cambridge in, uh, just last year. So it's such a pleasure to welcome you and we thank you for coming all this way to be with us, and I give you Professor Mpofu.

The Socio-Structural Barriers Impacting the Work participation of Refugees: A Systematic Mixed Studies Review Professor Elias Mpofu, PhD, DEd, CRC Discipline of Rehabilitation Counseling, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney The 2012 Winter Roundtable Conference February 24th and 25th , 2012 

00:03:15
My International Background 

00:03:15
SYNOPSIS INVESTIGATION ON THE SOSCIO-STRUCTURAL BARRIERS IMPACTING THE WORK PARTICIPATION OF REFUGEES There are various refugees statuses: > asylum seekers; refugees, unsuccessful refugee applicants; documented, undocumented > international transferability of skills is a significant structural barrier facing many immigrants > lack of recognition of existing qualifications and experience in the host country > expressed job-dissatisfaction due to a perception of being over qualified for the job 

00:03:15
SYNOPSIS: continued INVESTIGATION ON THE SOSCIO-STRUCTURAL BARRIERS IMPACTING THE WORK PARTICIPATION OF REFUGEES > language proficiency as an obstacle for many refugees seeking employment > Cultural insensitivity within support services can impede refugees' attempts to overcome the challenges they face in finding appropriate employment > The impact of psychological or other health-related conditions resulting from lack of employability 

00:03:15
PROCEDURE Conducted a systematic mixed studies review for greater understanding.... than one type of research approach alone Five major health and psychology-related databases were searched: Medline, PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus Utilised a snowballing approach, from reference lists and library search database, followed by a hand search of relevant journals 

00:03:15
systematic review included literature on the barriers experienced by refugees in attaining employment studies referred to: (a)asylum seekers (individuals awaiting UNHCR refugee status), (b) refugees (those granted refugee status); and (c) unsuccessful refugee applicants who continued residing in the host country PROCEDURE cont. Employable age was determined according to an internationally recognised minimum age of 14 years and a nominal retirement age of 65 (International Labour Organisation, 1973). review included studies with samples who were engaged in formal and informal labour markets as well as in entrepreneurial activities 

00:03:15
PROCEDURE cont. The selected literature search was further scrutinised through the application of a mixed methods appraisal checklist developed by Pluye et al. (2009) The checklist allows for four study methods: qualitative, quantitative, observational, quantitative experimental and mixed methods. Narrative synthesis (Popay, et al., 2006) combine data across several methodological approaches 

00:03:15
PROCEDURE cont. > Narrative synthesis is particularly valuable in mixed studies reviews such as it utilizes a four-tier approach to examining the research evidence: (1) preliminary analysis, (2) exploration of relationships, (3) assessment of the robustness of the synthesis, and 4) theory building > The preliminary synthesis was carried out by tabling the descriptive characteristics of the studies. > Thematic analysis was then utilised to extract various themes across the studies concerning the socio-structure barriers to refugees' vocational participation 

00:03:15
FINDINGS Edin, Frederiksson ...slund (2004) COUNTRY: SWE 12,562 refugees METHOD: LINDA database DATA ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics, regression analysis, difference-in-differences approach MAIN FINDINGS/BARRIERS Policy and placement/location after 8 years of arrival associated with earnings losses, increased idleness, and welfare dependency 

00:03:15
FINDINGS cont. Hugo (2011) COUNTRY: AUS Over 600, 1st and 2nd generation refugees METHOD: Settlement and databases, questionnaires, focus groups, in-depth interviews with DATA ANALYSIS Qualitative and thematic analysis MAIN FINDINGS/BARRIERS Lack of qualifications and education and knowledge about Australian labour market. Poor language proficiency, lack of networks and work experience. Challenging employment services structure. 

00:03:15
FINDINGS cont. Hume & Hardwick (2005) COUNTRY: UK 27 refugees and 16 social caseworkers and administrators METHOD Preliminary and In-depth interviews, participant observation, , statistical records, and cartographic analyses DATA ANALYSIS Qualitative analysis and constant comparison MAIN FINDINGS/BARRIERS Social support services increases chance of finding employment, difficulties with qualification recognition, language proficiency. 

00:03:15
FINDINGS cont. Thematic Analysis: Five main themes relevant to work participation were extracted from the included literature: flight experiences, origin-country human capital, host-country human capital, policy, and support networks and services. Flight Experiences Refugees who spent long periods in camps and had associated trauma and instability were more likely to experience decreased levels of work participation (Codell et al., 2011; Hugo, 2011; Lyon et al., 2007). long periods in reception or detention centres upon arrival were also negatively related to refugees' odds and quality of employment (de Vroome & van Tubergen, 2010) 

00:03:15
FINDINGS cont. Non-recognition or Devaluation of Origin-Country Human Capital Origin-country human capital (OHC) refers to the skills and knowledge obtained by immigrants in their country of origin (Kanas & van Tubergen, 2009). Relating to the recognition of OHC; a lack of documentation (Bloch, 2002; Lyon, et al., 2007; Menter & Smyth, 2008; Wauters & Lambrecht, 2008), and systemic issues (Bloch, 2002; Cohn, et al., 2006; Hussein, et al. 2011; Lamba, 2003). Lack of documentation. Documentation relating to educational or professional qualifications of refugees can be left behind in the urgency of the flight process or lost in transit. Efforts to gather documentation were often abandoned due to difficulties in communications with the country of origin (Wauters & Lambrecht, 2008; Lyon, et al., 2007). 

00:03:15
FINDINGS cont. > Systematic issues arise out of the requirements, policies and procedures of governments and institutions were a major barrier to work participation > Origin-country educational and professional qualifications and experience of refugees carried less value in the host country (Bloch, 2002; de Vroome & van Tubergen, 2010). > Under-employment was a common experience (Colic-Peisker & Tilbury (2006). > Host-country human capital was less valued by host country employers or would=be business partners(Kanas & van Tubergen, 2009). 

00:03:15
FINDINGS cont. Conclusion The evidence suggests that many refugees were considerably affected by barriers such as the level of language proficiency, the recognition of OHC and systemic issues. Some barriers have a flow on effect on other work participation challenges 

00:03:15
ELIAS MPOFU, PH.D. Thanks George. As, uh, George said, uh, you know, I think he put it better than I would say about myself. Now I know what to say when I tell people about me. Um, just, my talk will be about, uh, the socio- structural barriers impacting work participation of refugees. Um, for this I just did a systematic (ph)research (ph)study (ph)view because um, as a rehabilitation, eh, professor one of the major issues in the profession is the work participation of the people so the team for this conference, you know, containing refugees, immigrants, is something, uh, I have been working with together with their team at the University of Sydney. Uh, as you know, Australia, like the United States, attracts a lot of immigrants, uh, and legal, uh, documented and documented and uh, in fact, immigration and refugees are a major f-, in a political football in Australia, and uh, the two major political parties there make a good deal of business insulting each other about, uh, immigration policy, especially when it comes to refugees and all the people who arrive by boat, uh, because when, you know, they, they, they are so conspicuous because they arrive by boat and then they are, um, and marooned somewhere on Christmas Island, which is, uh, an Australian, uh, territory two-thousand kilometers away from the mainland and they stay there to be screened. Ah, there's been some riots, uh, at the island because the, uh, people are waiting. They are have assessment for refugee status have failed to (ph)unfairly (ph)teach (ph)it. Now, so it's a big, um, magnet for migrants in the Pacific region that is Australia and it's, it's a big, big, big issue, necessarily, uh, when they get documented and they move, uh, to live on the mainland there are obviously some very big issues about if they are in (ph)primate participation. So one of the things that I have been seeking to do was to look into the major themes that, uh, would be important for understanding their no work participation and experience. If you are a refugee or an immigrant, uh, we're not talking about, uh, legal, you know, undocumented, uh, of skilled immigrants like myself who went there about three-and-a-half years ago, we're only talking about people who are in disadvantage because of where they are coming from and uh, so as I speak about that I speak also knowing about the US experience where I live and I went to school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, '95 to '99 and I've spent most of my time in the US after that and worked at Penn State uh, where I was professor of rehabilitation services and then I was curious about kangaroos and the koala bears. Then I went to Australia to see for myself. I still want to go to Tasmania to see the Tasmanian Devil cuz I, I watch cartoons and uh, so a Tasmanian Devil has always been my favorite just to choose anything, everything. Doesn't matter whether it's steel, stones . . . Whatever. So I went on my visit pla- . . . You know, things to do is Tasmania and then I um . . . I'm originally from Zimbabwe and um, so I worked there as a school psychologist and moved into a rehabilitation eventually which is what I did for my PhD, and then I, I also do some work in Mbazwana and when the uh, (ph)capital (ph)grants (ph)granted by the National Institute of Health but mostly dealing talking with, working with (ph)churches on uh, teenage health issues and so I live in Australia currently. Now, the thing is that in the four countries I've lived in and have experienced I've also, uh, interacted with, uh, refugee and immigrant issues in work participation, so I bring on this presentation some research experience but uh, talking also to issues that um, are (ph)cool to be aware of from, uh, having lived in uh, four different countries and still continuing to identify with all the four countries that are part of my, or have become part of my interpersonal cultural identity. So this slide is about a demonstration that happened in um, uh, in (ph)Marabund, uh, last year, and uh, like I said, um, uh, refugees and immigrants, particularly those who arrive by boat, um, are often maligned and uh, the two political parties make a business of uh, trying to (ph)alter to each other and criticizing each other for having a soft, um, uh, refugee policy and they think that will result in the swamping of Australia, uh, by people in need and resulting in, uh, costs to the Australian government and um, uh, the citizenry is not always in (ph)aprementing with the theory that if immig-, uh, refugees come in they are necessarily going to cause economy cost, but there are others who believe that but this particular group of demonstrators were thinking like , "Well, the refugeesare being treated like uh, uh, prisoners that (ph)act (ph)like criminals and uh, there's, and there's a racist element involved in that and, uh, so it was a major, you know, uh, issue. Uh, as you can see the composition of the demonstrators from this (ph)sleeker (ph)snippet is quite diverse in terms of uh, racial, cultural membership (ph)train that is uh, fairly, uh, it's a very, uh, important issue to Australians and uh, uh, across the color line. Um, uh, you are aware that there are various refugee statuses of course. There are (ph)slum seekers and refugees who are and uh, legally recognized refugees by the United Nations, uh, convention on refugees, unsuccessful refugees who are sitting there and uh, sort of (ph)warehoused because they, you know, they are thought you are unsuccessful but we don't know where to send you to because you probably came from Afghanistan or are you a member of the (ph)Tamil (ph)Inotagas and they can't possibly come back to (ph)Salanka because better things are going to happen to you but nonetheless we think you may have been a fighter, uh, with the Tamil (ph)tagas so we can't migrate you to mainland. So you're unsuccessful but we don't know where to send you. And if you're Afghan, maybe we could send you back to Afghan but the Taliban will probably do something to you and so we're going to probably just maroon you some place, and then the documented and undocumented and then, interestingly, uh, most of the issues I'm going to speak about will be about people who take a boat and risk their lives, uh, to get to places i-, i-, i-, in, in the United States it would be people trying the Mexican border and walking across and they're getting, sometimes, put into those big trucks and some of them have suffocated and died, you know, just trying to make the US-Mexican border. Uh, but you see, there are the people who fly, huh? So they fly in, they come in through JFK or they get to Sydney. Well you know what? Well, they're treated differently and uh, there's very little discussion about those people. There seem to been some kind of privileged class because they flew in and so once they get to the immigration customs at the international airport and they are treated differently and they, they are, mostly, they are also better educated; they have some resources or stuff like that, and uh . . . But most of the refugees who are in the situation I'm talking about are very different. They are, they just bribed people maybe, if you were, if it was Australia they bribed someone to ship them all the way from Afghanistan, you know, to Indonesia, then from there, uh, they paid a lot of money just to be shipped into Australia and then they are intercepted by the coast, eh, coast guard then they're marooned on Christmas Island and then um, the major issues I'm going to speak about are the international (ph)transif, transferability of skills which is a significant barrier to uh, work participation and the lack of recognition of existing qualifications and experience in the host country, expressed job-dissatisfaction because they are under-employed and also language proficiency issues, uh, that are a major obstacle and uh, the cultural insensitivity, uh, within support services and impact of uh, uh, these, these disadvantages on employability because they have some (ph)sacrilege (ph)going (ph)down their health needs. So in order to do this I conducted a systematic, uh, mixed studies review, uh, (ph)at (ph)new . . . and then that meant, um, you know, doing a (ph)step-through-step for Web of Sciences, CINAHL, Scopus, Medline, and then uh, in addition to that, after identifying some relevant articles, went through some snowballing, uh, searching through the reference list of those particular citations, you know, they're to go for other, um, you know, sources that may not show in the typical search, and that, and also it uh, my, uh, student assistant do a manual search in the library. Um, so what happened in these um, the focus was on systematic, uh, (ph)I (ph)know, barriers to work participation and then uh, the, the uh, cut-off in terms of the age of people to talk about is fourteen to sixty-five, following the guidelines of International Labor Organization, and then um, so any studies that referenced asylum seekers, um, uh, UNHCR refugees, that is refugees, (ph)unsucksfu-, unsuccessful refugee applicants, you know, included those, and also review status um, for in, in terms of those involved in formal and informal labor. So the literature selected, um, we, I used a mixed-method checklist, you know, just to make sure that I'm being consistent, uh, about the studies that are being selected, and um, essentially, after that, did a narrative synthesis, um, to kind of translate the meanings and understandings from one study to the next. As you can expect, when you do, um, these kind of mixed-method studies, uh, the typical approach to used with the standard meta-analysis like, "Oh. I'm just going to look at these statistics and do an effect size check," it don't just work because the studies combine some ethnographic stuff, yeah, uh, some observational stuff there, and a few of them follow the rigorous quantitative review and I'm also persuaded too to the importance of ethnographic studies. Apparently, my personal persuasion is that if you are doing studies on people with personal disadvantage you're probably going to get a lot more using an ethnographic approach than the usual, uh, (ph)throw (ph)a savvy calculate something because most of their stories are yet to be told and uh, as a result, they're often excluded from uh, you know, the kind of, uh, "databases" that exist up, you know, to document their experience. So, so my particular ex-, preference is informed by those personal, uh, uh, preferences. So the narrative synthesis is particularly valuable in mixed studies, um, despite that, you know, you may find that it is under-valued by, um, certain um, uh, say, journals and that are outlets of scholarship are telling a personal story, uh, but um, six, you know, eight weeks I'd go uh, eh, eh, eh, my self and the team of uh, collaborators at the University of Sydney did a narrative synthesis study on um, uh, chronic pain and its effect on um, uh, work participation variable including, you know, presentism, which is when you are at work but you're not really working, you see, because maybe you've got some (ph)pen (ph)issues, but you see, you kind of wouldn't know to come because that may cost you your job. And then also (ph)absentism, a-, a-, and the issues like that. So we sent that to a rehabilitation psychology and though I taught, "Um, you see we're only consider meta-analysis," you see the uh, and we're astounded at uh, the uh, uh, you know, the level of uh, (ph)mytholo-, (ph)mythological, (ph)mythothological (ph)uh, (ph)priviliges, in uh, in a (ph)PA listed journal. Nonetheless, um, I personally believe narrative analysis is extremely important, particularly when you are dealing with issues for which you have maybe a total of (ph)twenty-six studies that have been done and eh, most of these would be ethnographic. Anyway, so, what does this do for you? Allows you a (ph)preminal analysis, exploration of relationships, assessment of robustness of the synthesis and you can do some theory building using that and uh, so we credit, uh, (ph)preminal synthesis by (ph)tappling out, uh, (ph)tappling the descriptive characters of the studies. So it's mostly descriptive but allowing for thematic analysis and so, um, in terms of the findings I'm just going to highlight, eh, what came through from the major articles that were particularly pertinent, uh, because after screening we ended up with fifteen studies that were irrelevant to the discussion. After starting with an initial list of four-hundred and sixty-nine studies that listed refugees somewhere uh, but were not really looking at, uh, clear work participation issues. We cut that down to thirty-nine but we still had to cut it down to fifteen, you know that, you know, for this study, but so what I'm going to talking about just some of these (ph)like, (ph)set, set (ph)by, um, uh, Fredriksson and, and, uh, Edin, Fredriksson and �...slund, um, where they looked at a light sample of refugees and um, and then they used um . . . This was quantitative, um, but nonetheless, the measure of finding was that policy and the placement, location after eight years of arrival was associated with earnings losses, increased idleness and welfare dependency because what happens is they arrive and then are kept out of, uh, the employment cycle, um, with the (ph)stud would have been in Sweden, so what have they? The refugees may be placed in locations that have lower employment opportunities, so they just stay over there and the longer they stay in those locations, the less they are likely to access employment and they actually lose employment-seeking skills and then their welfare state like, uh, Sweden and some of these (ph)Nordic countries, uh, you know, you (ph)prob less on some kind of welfare service and uh, that takes away, you know, job-seeking skills after a while and then uh, the study by Hugo (ph)and (ph)that (ph)is, um, uh, then um, they looked at uh, mostly, uh, (ph)certain (ph)man sends us data and we followed that up with some focus group discussions, in-depths interviews with uh, with people similar to those, uh, identified through the census, and uh, did some qualitative and thematic analysis, and again, lack of qualifications, education, knowledge about Australian labor market issues and, and uh, poor language proficiency, lack of networks, work experience. Uh, (ph)with (ph)this (ph)we (ph)met (ph)our (ph)challenges. Now we, we got to understand that um, in the Australian context, the language proficiency's one of the major, um, uh, things that uh, the Australian government is concerned about. So, for example, in order to drive taxis or a cabs in Australia, you must have uh, passed an English language test, eh, because they . . . That, that told us this from last year because they don't want people, taxi drivers, who can't speak to customers who are presumed to be necessarily English-speaking. Uh, so, um, if you're talking about any of these other professions, uh, let's say teaching for example, or (ph)nessing, uh, but they've got an international language test that they use with cut-off points that are fairly high, and um, and you are e-, exempted from taking the language proficiency test if you are from the United States, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. Right. Those are the only countries exempted from the language test. Now, it's not . . . Uh, depending on which profession you're trying to get into it's sort of like an easy language test, I believe, because even locals failed. Some locals failed the test, uh, when they did a, uh, an experiment just to start to see where the, you know, locals would pass the English language test. Well, so happens in a good proportion of uh, first language speakers of English actually failed the test and now you can imagine, uh, what this would be, eh, for peep, for people from the international community who are refugees, it's even harder. Uh, so what it means is if you don't pass the English language test, you know what? You may have been, um, a medical doctor i-, uh, in India or some place or Afghanistan but you're probably going to be just cleaning places in Australia, uh, because, you know, you couldn't (ph)acty pass (ph)co, um, th-, this has nothing to do with your skills as a surgeon, it's all to do with uh, you know, this cause, and uh, there's a . . . It's comprehension, uh, listening, speaking and writing. So those are the four sections. Now, um, well, if you are a refugee and uh, you were speaking with an accent, uh, that may work (ph)aganist you on the speaking test, huh? Okay, now, now if you, if you have not uh, (ph)climatested the Australian accent you may have some problems with the listening test as well, so there are many levels at which you can be challenged. Um, nonetheless, uh, these factors were important to work participation and then another study, uh, by Hume and others . . . So they did um, (inaudible ) uh, care (ph)swaykers, administrators were interviewed qualitative, uh, in a kind of study, in-depth interviews and also looking at um, studies correct (inaudible) graphic analysis just to make sure that um, uh, what they were, people they were talking to was, uh, their profile, you know, that matched the study goals and social support services, uh, increased chances of finding employment, so the network is very important, but mostly, uh, the study suggests that uh, you, if you are networked with locals, or (ph)osticountry citizens, um, you probably will land a job, uh, and also if you are networked with other immigrants from your culture of origin, uh, who may share with you their experiences. And then, of course, it depends on, like I said, how you come in. Uh, well, so if you, um, what kind of background do you bring. Uh, most of these refugees who were persecuted in their own countries and they've lost (ph)one country, human capital; they no longer have contacts there to help them go forward and um, um, and th-, they are home human capital in terms of their skills (ph)best may be, uh, may not be valued in the home country. They don't have much of social networks, so if you spend a long time in a refugee detention camp you are less likely to land a job six months, uh, for six months after you are transitioned from refugee center into the, uh, into the community, so the longer you s-, time you spend in the detention center you (ph)sit sort of get de-skilled not only in terms of these (ph)practaerial skills for doing the job but also just your wiring, eh, in your, your understanding of uh, accessing employment and uh, you are (ph)villaged by (ph)dissipating successful interview and then uh . . . So long periods in reception or (ph)decision centers are, eh, negative to employment participation, and then um, of course the issue the recognition of qualifications and, you know, while we ask how it works, for example, in Australia. Again, you are likely to, your lack of qualifications are (ph)like to pick up (ph)an (ph)iced (ph)eave (ph)day (ph)away from the United States, England, Canada, Ireland . . . You know, the usual list. Now, they are less likely to (ph)very (ph)cup (ph)an (ph)iced (ph)tea if they were from another country other than those and so, uh, most refugees don't happen to come from those countries, right? They typically don't come from United States, England and Canada, okay? So they come from other places and uh, their qualifications it may, they may have to re-train, you know, you know, if they were in Australia to, you know, (ph)Texas labor market, and . . . Or they go through an (ph)egress interview of their qualifications and uh, usually their qualification is going to be denied, and I've, I, I am head of discipline for rehabilitation se-, uh, counseling, and uh, we have enrolled, uh, medical doctors from India into rehab counseling courses because that's the only foothold they could have to be legally admitted into Australia with their graduate qualification leading to employment. Then they would then do the medical exams and additional training. Uh, so I've seen people register for courses that they ordinarily would not choose to do, eh, because their qualifications were in question. Um, so the documentation, um, is a major issue and uh, if you were a refugee and they ran off because of persecution you may not be carrying your diploma certificates with you and it's (ph)want very difficult to get them, you know, from home country. After all, they already looking for you if you a political refugee and so any discussion to your relatives and friends you would (ph)random they don't pretend to know where you are. Otherwise, they too, may be in serious trouble. So in, i-, in summary, uh, there are systematic issues, uh, um, for in terms of policies and regulations and uh, less sensitive um, eh, social, uh, you know, government agencies. You're working with the refugees and origin of country's (ph)gressional qualifications not being recognized. Under-employment . . . You're going to be doing something else than you're trying to do and uh, you have lost your home country human capital. So essentially, um . . . So the evidence suggest that many refugees who are considerably affected by barriers, uh, like we spoke about and uh, some of these barriers have a flow on effect, so they kind of interlink, leading to even more (ph)adverse (ph)altcaps. Uh, thank you so much. One of the reasons why we're doing the systematic literature review was eh, not done to approach the Australian government, you know, for finding to do more focused studies and uh, that could then, uh, find their way into policy and implementation (ph)grow (ph)a (ph)synth (ph)is (ph)such (ph)a (ph)polo, a, a very (ph)motive issue in Australia did, like I said, a major (ph)foli-, political football. (ph)You (ph)see (ph)the (ph)of (ph)they . . . One of the things I did when I go went to Australia was to talk up to platform rehabilitation eh, not necessarily is about disability in the sense of muscular, skeletal disorders and they are the bodily impairment. I said, "No. Rehabilitation is about disadvantage," and that's going to be inclusive of populations in advantage, uh, and uh, including people with with the disabilities. And so, uh, eh, that's where the field is going and I, I, I'm happen to be very fortunate in that when I went to Australia four years, uh, three years ago (inaudible ) the secretary for the Australian Society of Rehabilitation and Counselors which is a very powerful position to influence the field, uh, and um, so I'm kind of working those kind of issues into the entire realm of, you know, services area. Now you know if you want to get a job in Australia and uh, you are pretending to be a refugee you better fly in. Uh, don't take a boat. Uh, I'm not sure if you came in one of those luxury, the luxury boats you know? They're just going to sit in harbor and you'll say, "No I, I'm a refugee." Now, they'll probably accept you but if you take some of these ones from Indonesia, you know, that are broken down, you're not going to get anywhere. Thank you for coming for the presentation. Such a pleasure to share with you.
