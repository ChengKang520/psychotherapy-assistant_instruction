RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name is Rich Simon. I'm editor of Psychotherapy Networker and your host for this Networker series on twenty-first century parenting. So today we're gonna address a-a question that is really very central to many of us who were trained in family therapy back in the late 70's and the early 80's about how our approaches to families and coordinating work with kids and their families has changed over that time. And we're very fortunate that we have with us, Martha Straus, my former cl-, least of her distinctions, my former classmate at the University of Maryland Clinical Psychology program. Martha, welcome. 

00:00:55
MARTHA STRAUS Thank you. 

00:01:00
RICH SIMON So, Martha has, um, been working with families and with kids and with adolescents dealing with complex trauma for, uh, since graduate, her graduate school days and is a backbone of the Psychotherapy Networker conference. So, Martha, l-l-let's start off and, and let's put this conversation in context. So both you and I were trained, uh, in family therapy in graduate school. That was the, systems theory was the thing and the family therapy model was the way to go. You were trained at the Haley Institute. So let's capture for people who may not have been part of that particular era in, uh, the, the field. What was the assumptions. What were the op-, the key assumptions of the family therapy approach at that time. 

00:01:45
MARTHA STRAUS Well, at our graduate program was a clinical community program and I think that's salient, too. We thought about children in contexts in the late 70's, uh, as fallout from the community mental health movements. And, um, family therapy burgeoned in that, uh, time. So, for my training, I thought about, um, kids in contexts and systems. And people who got involved in the late 70's and '80's in family therapy got swept into this very exciting paradigm shift of thinking about systems instead of individuals. And it had a tremendous amount of allure. It was much more exciting kind of therapy work to do than sitting, problem-solving with an individual. Uh, it featured very dynamic and charismatic leaders and we wanted to be like them or at least I did. And, uh, you did, too. Well, and Jay Haley was nearby and so, uh, I went to conferences and trainings and got involved in understanding, uh, children through this really dynamic, exciting, systemic lens. That you could have an impact somewhere in a system and it would change another part. Uh, there was a move away from diagnosis of, uh, individuals into diagnosing systems so that the blaming of pathologizing of kids which has certainly come back, uh, full throttle was not a problem in that model and in that way of conceptualizing. So it was very seductive and exciting and, uh, in its heyday, we had a lot of clout, I think, in these training places where we would just say to families, and this was true in graduate training programs and, and the instanc-, various family, family instances where people wanted to get the training, uh, and the families wanted to come in and we'd say everyone has to come in. Some, some of these systems were everybody. The four year olds, the grandparents, multi-generational. There was a lot of excitement around, uh, getting lots of people in. Uh, all the players. And, uh, we had a lot of clout to do that because they wanted to see, you know, the best, or be trained, whatever. So we had much more authority than in the real world. 

00:04:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. And we... 

00:04:10
MARTHA STRAUS And they wanted to come and they did. 

00:04:10
RICH SIMON And we-, people really. We believed that was the way to work. So we were very, we, uh, that generation of therapists was instilled with the idea that if you're gonna work with a, a child, whatever the issue was, you needed to have the relevant context for that child to come into your office. So what happened. So these, th-, uh, let's just jump ahead, uh, you know. Uh... 

00:04:35
MARTHA STRAUS Well, I have to jump back. I'm gonna jump backwards to jump ahead because on my internship at the Yale Child Study Center, they were still doing the, uh, child guidance model, by and large. And this, the therapist would see the child and a social worker would do parent work with the parent someplace else in the building. And, uh, that was the model. And you could still think systemically but you wouldn't say that out loud. So I got kind of indoctrinated by that and also into the pure pleasure of child therapy. Being with children, helping children. Advocating for them. Uh, without the, uh, noise and bothersome, uh, parents around who weren't cooperating or, whatev-. I mean, it was kind of a funny time that way, too, because in a world kind of divided into people who wanted to work with adults and thought the children were bothersome. And, uh, those of us that work with children and adolescents thought the parents were in the way. Then, then I guess in my own life a lot of, two things happened. One is I entered the real world and I think the other is I became a parent, myself. And, uh, that sort of happened at the same time, in my own development. And suddenly I couldn't call the shots exactly as I wanted to. And then I didn't really know which shots I wanted to call because I had experienced, um, satisfaction and success and also frustration and failure in both modalities. Uh, when I left the mother ship, both of those mother ships. So, uh, boots on the ground. Uh, suddenly parents didn't want to come in or suddenly there, they wanted to do something that didn't feel like therapy to me. They wanted to recite all of the things that their child had done wrong. that week. And, or, I had an idea for how an activity was gonna go or a conversation was gonna go, and something else happens. Um, that wasn't what I had in mind at all. And then I had to start reevaluating, I think, where I can get my bang for the buck, really. Um, basically where my energy would be best, uh, utilized for making change and helping people. And I-I think that as I've become more pragmatic I still think systemically. I also think developmentally and dynamically also. Uh, so it, I'm able to bring these different strands into the work. If you conceptualize the problem or the situation is a family problem or family situation is located there, it gives you tremendous amount of latitude, even if you're just seeing the child alone. Because you don't have to worry about confidentiality in the same way. And you don't have to worry about how to bring people in because you've already established that that's what you're going to do. Um, it's tidier. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. S-So o-one thing, I mean, th-the, so w-wh-, for a certain generation of therapists and, and for those of us who were part of that, uh, I think you, you're, you captured it just very we, we lived in a bubble. A culture, a therapeutic culture in which you, y-y-, a family came in, we insisted on it, everybody believed in it. We were part of a movement, and that was the way, uh, child therapy was family therapy. And once we moved past that and once that moment, uh, no longer seemed to be compelling. That movement didn't have the same power, the world started to look differently. So, over this time, uh, you have, there are a number of, uh, you've made some distinctions in your own practice where not only is it a matter of pragmatics, getting kids in and not only, uh, a matter of your having kids and seeing things in a more varied way. But also it seems, seems to me that you, one of the things that you and I have talked about is your idea that sometimes it is preferable to see a child separate from that ch-, that child's parents. There's a number of, talk to us about that. What are the circumstances under which you would prefer to see a child alone and not involve the parents. 

00:09:00
MARTHA STRAUS I made, I made this, I-I, when I was thinking about talking to you about this, I, I started making kind of a list of how I'm making those decisions and with the nuances of it and I came up with six scenarios where I don't see parents. I just see the kids. And try to involve the parents to the extent that it's possible, but my work is child focused. Uh, the first is when parents are very rejecting of the child. Uh, either because of their psychopathology or their trauma, um, or because of the child's behavior being so upsetting to them. It doesn't really matter why the result is that in the therapy room I can't get any traction on moving forward out of this, uh, very extreme rejection and anger toward the child. Um, there's a lot of child blame that goes on. Um, there might be a situation that, uh, the family refuses to participate but I think wow, having a supporting person in this child's life would really make a difference. Um, family remains intractably adamant that the only problem they have is this child and if I just fix that everything would be fine in their lives. So I have a decision to make whether my uh, becoming somebody different in that child's life. Um, I had a 12 year old girl I was working with, uh, who I worked with alone who had this very, very rejecting hostile domestic situation. And, his, her the, the grown-ups in her life were kind of infantile in the way the blamed her. They didn't really step up and say we're the adults here. And she said to me, once, this was very moving to me. You know, you're the only grown-up I know. And, so, that was a, that was a lot of responsibility, you know, I, that was a different lens to see myself, uh, through. But also very supporting this idea that even if the family can't come on-board because of their anger toward the child, there might be a place for the therapy work that will move the child's life ahead and to a better place, a more successful place. Even if the parents, uh, and family structure is not going to support. Um, I also sort of following from this, the second kind of category is if the parents are really too impaired to benefit from therapy. Uh, too emotionally disturbed, too substance addicted, um, too involved in anti-social behavior of their own. Um, too debilitated by, uh, major psychopathology, mental illness, dissociative identity disorder, psychosis. Um, also if the level of conflict between the parents is so toxic and unrelenting, uh, that they just make the kid crazy for the child to sit through that. And I think right now with a-a 16 year old girl whose mom is, uh, has major mental illness, uh bipolar disorder and some other pretty impairing, um, active kinds of psychiatric problems. And she doesn't want her mom in there. It's too confusing. There's too much attention that has to be paid to managing her mother's, um, disregulation. And, um, it's been really helpful, uh, to support her in understanding her mother's mental illness and to have a relationship with her where she can start out her own way. 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. So there's th-th-, I guess the, uh, idea, um, that we had watching Minuchin, uh, do his thing or, or Haley show his, his directives. Was that, uh, no, no problem was insurmountable. That all, that all of the things you're talking about in the world that I think that most of us experience and the obstacles that most of us experience, they're, they're real obstacles. But I think, again, the contrast with the other original culture is that was somehow, th-that if you couldn't deal with that it was, uh, more of a statement on the persistence and the ingenuity of the therapist as opposed to, maybe there's some situations where therapy simply wasn't the way to go. 

00:13:20
MARTHA STRAUS Yeah, I see that. I do. I can see that, you know, Rich. I-I think that maybe Haley and Minuchin could probably deal with some of these families that are opting out of working with. Uh, I saw Palazzoli do a demonstration, you know, a hundred years ago, and I often sort of hold that image. And she was this little fireball, you know. I bet she, you know, no parental pathology too severe, you know. But I-I feel like in terms of my energy and effort I'm s-s-, just needing to make these distinctions in order to have a clear path to really feeling that I, with my unique set of, um, skills and weaknesses, can be effective. And so there's a humility in this list, even though I'm, uh, pronouncing it very boldly. I feel comfortable about it because I think you're absolutely right and I ho-, I'm teaching, uh, right now, I'm teaching family therapy, uh, to graduate students and I'm showing them these tapes. I showed them a Virginia Satir tape, uh, last week in which she is doing an intervention with 10 children, a family with 10 children. I don't know if you remember this tape. But, I mean, I-I just feel so, I've seen it many times now I've taught it many times and I'm so humbled and new by it. 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON In awe. 

00:14:35
MARTHA STRAUS In awe. Yeah. She's got a four year old under her arm, and you know, she's, at the end she's showing the mother how to hug the father in a way that would be really helpful to the father. She's physically hugging the dad. I mean, all these amazing physical things in the room that, that are, well, now unethical, are really intimidating to imagine. So. Okay, so, another cat-, third category, parents are exploitative. Uh, this would be a situation where you have child abuse, where the custodian parent doesn't believe the child, uh, the Cinderella kind of story, uh, where the prettification of the child is so extreme, uh, emotionally and physically that there's no leverage in this, I think, to get the child to get to be a kid again. And, um, I am working right now with an eight year old boy who had abuse history and his, his custodial parent did not believe that what happened, happened at, at the hands of a partner. And I can't work with the parents, uh, effectively in the room with the child. I'm reaching out to them, I want to see them separately, but that level of invalidation of the child and exploitation of, of a child's narrative and something that was medically found to be true. This one would be for kids that really have effectively don't have parents. And I'll put parents in quotes. Um, system kids who are moving between homes, where I become kind of a transitional object. I'll just see the child. Uh, college kids who are away from home or older adolescents who are emancipated or are on the road to being so, who really have such a-a-adverse relationships with their parents over such a long period of time that my work is, is with the adolescents or with a child. Um, a-a-a fifth category here is when the kid, child has a good reason for not including their parents, and now I decide myself. I don't leave it up to them entirely, but, uh, good reasons could be a child requesting individual therapy to discuss coming out, or to talk about school issues or social issues that really aren't about the family and don't need the family as part of the solution at the time. I mean, maybe down road. Uh, in situations of divorce and remarriage or traumatic loss, uh, I also find, uh, opportunities in meeting, at least for a time, alone, uh, with the child or adolescents. Uh, and finally, I don't know how, this is kind of an extreme situation but, and maybe this is another case where, uh, Minuchin would laugh if he heard me say this, uh, but, um, cases of severe patriarchy where, uh, there is such a power imbalance in the room between children and women and, uh, uh, patriarch of a family because of culture, or belief system or, um, domestic violence. There is a level of, um, intimidation where I don't put myself through it anymore. A few years ago I had a family come in and the dad was a semi-retired police officer. And I was thinking family therapy, and I challenged his authority in some way, I thought in a pretty innocuous and subtle way, and he crossed his leg and he had a gun on his ankle. This thing, you know. And, I mean, you know, I said, I made a comment about it, but then I thought why am I doing this, you know. I mean, I-I'm happy to meet with them separately but I'm not going to get into power struggles over authority with parents with the adolescent or child in the room. It doesn't help anyone. 

00:18:35
RICH SIMON As long, especially when somebody has a firearm. I made, I made borrow that for my next staff meeting. Make sure my... 

00:18:40
MARTHA STRAUS It's very, very assertive. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON That is an effective way of asserting authority in that situation. Oh my gosh. So, alright, so these are guiding principles. And l-let's, one of the things that, um, that we try to do in all of these series is really give therapists an idea, a very on the ground idea of the working methods th-, of the different guests that we have in these webcasts. So, that's in your head and you're screening for that, notice the questions that you're, uh, asking yourself in terms of whether something's gonna wind up being a family therapy or child case. Give us, uh, a-a, what's the first interview like. So it's, here's the situation, you haven't made any of these determinations yet, you know, maybe, might even a-a case that you've seen fairly recently that might come to mind. But just give people a flavor, so how do you set therapy in motion. 

00:19:30
MARTHA STRAUS I always being with the parents, um, without the child or adolescent even with middle adolescents. Maybe older, I would rethink it. But I always start with parents. Um, they're paying the bills, they own the medical records, uh, without their support I can lose the case. Without setting the context for change, uh, again, I'm thinking systemically, no matter what. Uh, I need to know as an adult to an adult, what their expectations are and I need them to know the methods of my madness so there's no surprises down the line. And, uh, I now, I was a, I was away last fall and I took back some supervisees who, uh, had been working with other supervisors that aren't doctrinaire this way. And I feel like we're playing clean-up, uh, with two different cases in which, uh, if they had met with the parents first, they would not be in this ac-ac-acrimonious state with the, uh, mothers in both cases. Uh, because they would be on the same page. I also see myself, and maybe it's because I am a parent now and that's another step in that evolution that I mentioned, but I also see myself and say this very explicitly as having the other end of the rope. That if I sign on with a family, whether I do individual child work or parent work or family work or different combinations, I see myself as part of the team with the parents. And I'm very explicit about this because what I want to be able to do is to free the parents up just to love their kids and worry about them less and know that I have the other end of the rope. Um, a recent case was a 15 year old girl that was doing some self-harm. She was doing some cutting. And, the mother was understandably very distraught and was spending a lot of time going through her daughter's stuff and trying to talk to her about it and their relationship was getting kind of toxified by the mother's anxiety. And so I said to the mom, we're dealing with this. I have the other end of the rope. You need to go back to having Sunday pizza and movie nights with her. And I thought that I've got it, I'm on it. And to see her visible, ahh, you know, and their relationship improved consequently, I thought, I think that it's really important ingredient. So I always start with the parents because if I can't get on the same page with them and this includes non-custodial dads, or, who, or moms who are not there. But I try to get really together with the adults so that we are setting the frame around the child and around the family for, for what the needs are. At that point, I also say, let's go three or four times in trying some things and then let's meet again and make a plan so we can see if I'm being helpful and we can see if everyone likes what I'm doing and, uh, I'll have a better sense of what the family is all about at that time, and what your child is all about and. So, so I hold myself to a very high level of accountability this way, also. I'm not just disappearing into a room with, with a child. I'm accountable to the parents. That's the relationship. That's the communication, uh, that has to, ultimately, through one way or another, be the communication that takes place. 

00:23:00
RICH SIMON So in the first session, so you're, y-you wanna make sure that you're not getting into an us them relationship with the parents. You're connecting with them, you're getting some sense of family interaction. Um, if there are three or four things at the end of the first hour with a family, or, how long are your first sessions. 

00:23:20
MARTHA STRAUS About an hour and a half, usually. Sometimes longer if there's more than one parent. 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON Okay. Alright, so, at the end of that hour and a half, what is it that you would, at, at looking back on that time, what is it that you w-will have wanted to, what do you want to accomplish. 

00:23:30
MARTHA STRAUS Well, I will want to know whether I can deliver what it is they're asking for. And I will want to know that we have a collaborative sense of how we're going to proceed. Um, that, uh, I can articulate and, uh, discuss with them. I wanna have a sense of their sense of the problem in their family dynamic and strengths and weaknesses and I wanna begin the narrative that is, uh, a thickened narrative of... 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Thickened narrative. 

00:24:05
MARTHA STRAUS Thickened narrative, right. Where they're talking about what is vexing and difficult. But also, um, what makes their family special and their understanding of their child or adolescent and, and love, uh, evident also. I mean, I could try to pull for the concern and the investment as I plan ahead. So I do a genogram, uh, every time, um and I'm training up all of my students to do that. That's a vestige of, of good family therapy training. And, uh, amazing amount of information gleaned just from that. But get a sense of sort of the development of the child and the development of the problem and the development of the family. Where they are in terms of sort of the family life cycle and what that, uh, um, environmental and cultural and contextual presses on this child and family at this point and time are. And, uh, I like to have mapped out sort of how I see the next two or three times going down. Whether to include the child the next time. I'm seeing a family right now. I've seen them four times but I haven't met the child who supposedly the patient. Um, because I'm doing a lot of work with the parents to understand how they live in the world with this child so that when he comes in to the family session, I am on the same page with them and have a way of communicating with them that's respectful and doesn't undermine what they're doing and, uh, has a kind of, uh, I don't know, a kind of integrity to it. So that he knows the adults are, to-t, it's a 13 year old boy who's experimenting with substances and he really needs to know that there are adults watching him and taking care of him right now. So I really need to have that set up with them ahead of time. We've been doing that. He's coming in next week. So, we're beginning. 

00:26:05
RICH SIMON So, i-i-, so given just what you've said so far, is that so different then from, at this stage of the game, from what you started with when you first began to learn how to be a family therapist. 

00:26:15
MARTHA STRAUS Um, no. Although a lot of the family therapy models begin with everyone. And end up just seeing the parents. I mean, that is another thing that has happened, I think, over time. That a lot of people who had a lot of juice for family therapy, um, continued to have juice when it was an adolescent involved because those are very exciting. People yell at each other and, right, you know, verbal adolescent case. But, people stop being as interested in working with younger kids because they would end up just talking to the parents and the kids would be playing on the floor nearby or distracting or interrupting. And, a lot of people ended up just seeing parents after a while. I mean, and that's true with our, with our mentors, too. I mean, I think that you look even with Virginia Satir or Murray Bowen. A lot of these people are really began believing in bringing everyone in. And ended up doing a lot of work just with the parents, which is a good model, too. But I think one of the reasons people got there, and this is my angle on this, is that we started to see family therapy as another talk therapy. Uh, based on adult principles of, um, cognition and, uh, communication of affect through language. And, that really left kids in the dust. And as kids got more and more annoying, they're upside down on the couch when the, and the parents are admonishing them or not admonishing them and the kid are trashing the office, it feels less appealing somehow. 

00:27:55
RICH SIMON That's right. That's right. 

00:27:55
MARTHA STRAUS So people don't, you know, they break it up. 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. So that, that's, so that's really s-something th-that I think is a very distinctive contribution that, that you make and you, you present the, uh, Networker symposium on this. This whole importance of understanding play and the language of play. And this is, there is a, a, a divide in our field between therapists who feel very comfortable in conversations of whatever type. No matter what, how difficult the, the, the content of that conversation as, as long as it's a conversation. So talk about play and why it's important if you're gonna be a family therapist and certainly a child therapist that you, w-what is it that play tells us. What is play as a tool that goes beyond just having conversation. 

00:28:45
MARTHA STRAUS Okay. Well, in terms of family work, I, it, the idea would be to merge fears. To come up with a way in which there is a level and a playing field so that people, literally, uh, so that people are, uh, all able to participate in an equivalent way. And it's a lot easier if you're gonna merge fears to have adults behave like children than it is to have children behave like adults. Right. So, I'm thinking if you're going to figure how to do this, so, so one reason is just pr-, again, pragmatics. It's a lot easier to get families to play than to get nine year olds to problem-solve in this adult way, because they don't, they don't have the brain to do it. And everybody gets frustrated and mad and disregulated and that's not therapy. So, um, play is how kids communicate. Play is fun, it's joyful, uh, it is metaphorical. Um, helping parents understand what the content of their child's play is about, what it means, how to understand it, how to play with them. Um, provides incredible window into how the child problem solves, how the child learns to self-soothe, how the child understands relationships and mean-, makes meaning out of, um, struggles and enables them to resolve within the metaphor of play, move ahead and come up with new solutions to impasses and problems. I mean, it's universal and it's a great thing. I had a, a kid I was seeing and his three year old sis-, a couple of years ago, his three year old sister was in the waiting room and I, uh, gave her this little basket of little wooden guys, you know, trees and horses and p-, fire engines, and firemen. Uh, to play with that in the waiting room, keep her busy while I was seeing her big brother. And about two minutes later as we settled down in the room, there was a knock on the door and the little sister is there holding the basket. And I said, what's up. And she said, you forgot to give me the batteries. She had no idea what to do with these little wooden characters. And so when I'm, especially with kids with complex trauma, I'm seeing kids who don't really know how to play anymore. Either, they're either, uh, plugged into electronics or they're involved in numerous activities that are adult-led, and, um, when kids get bored, there are screens and other interventions that take place and so that the self-soothing and creativity that comes out of boredom in childhood has been somewhat eliminated for a lot of kids. And, um, for kids who are traumatized, they have to learn how to play. They have to. That's part of the beginning, before you can even do play therapy or some kind of working through of trauma with kids through the modality of play, they have to learn how to do it. To be an adult has to allow themselves to let down their defenses and become more absorbed in the play. And for parents with kids who are really suffering and struggling and anxious, play is imperative. And parents need to learn how to do it, too, and I understand it and respect it and provide opportunities for it. Um, especially with younger children. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON So, let's, let's, let's go a little deeper into that and let's, of course this has to start with the therapist knowing something about play and how to play and to be able to pass this along to parents and to play with children and perhaps the children know it anyhow. But many of us adults don't. So when you're working with your trainees and you're, and they're good, like, to many of us. They're lovely, they're good listeners, they reflect so they can validate, they can do, do all the nice things that we nice, do in talk therapy. But they, they are at a loss when they have to be with a, a younger child. And, and, um, be in a play interaction. So, how do you help therapists learn how to play. 

00:33:05
MARTHA STRAUS Uh, it's such a great question now also, because of, I think this is true of the p-, our own trauma post-manage care where you can't just play. So trainees come in, they say, oh, Marty, I just played for an hour. You know, and I'm like, yes, this is great. What was it like, what was the quality of it, what was the interaction. What did you notice in his affect over the course of the hour. You know, what did you, what did you see. What did you play, what did it feel like to play with him, you know. And we unpack this whole world which is a child's world, right. And, it's not just playing but we've, we've come to this. And, um, I understand that because parents, the kid comes home and the parents go, what did you do with Dr. Straus and the kid says, oh, we just played. Um, and I'm, and I'm like, wow, yeah. That's kind of true, right. But what we did was we turned the sorry board into a battle station and over the period of the time we cooperated so we were trading pieces and on the same team taking each others pieces and he let me into this world of competition and cooperation that I didn't know was preoccupying for him. And I was really able to help him problem-solve through these, uh, impasses through just playing. Or Nerf basketball. Nerf basketball is not just playing. It's problem-solving, you learn how to get the ball in from all these different parts of the room, backwards, while being blocked. And at the end, well, I say to the child that I'm doing it with, wow, you just came up with so many ways to, to solve the problem of getting the ball in the basket. Let's talk about how you're gonna get your math homework in on time, because you are such a creative problem-solver. And he's going to go home, and I've done this amazing unfolding with him, uh, uh, flexible, uh, problem-solving set that this little rigid anxious boy didn't know he had. He struts on out, and then he tells his mother, we just played. But then, in my case now, I'm able to say, well, let's talk about what you noticed that's different and sure enough, he's doing better all of the sudden and it's a miracle. Well, it's not a miracle. It's, he, play is curative and healing whether you're playing with a child or, uh, with a family. 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON And it-it's, I, I was, uh, my daughter's 26, it's been a long time since that, that, that play word that you're describing. But, just anybody who's had this experience recently knows that, knows if you haven't, you absolutely have to. Uh, I was, we visited some friends, uh, my wife, Jette, is Danish, went to their home and I'd gotten to, to be buddies with these two little girls. And one of them took me up and she had an actual tree house in the backyard that her father had built for her in this ideal little, uh. And she proudly showed me her room, and then of all these things, she took out her most prized toys, were these little plastic figures with her tiny, adorable little fingers. And there's something, and, and you do this for a living, but for me it was like, wow. She was just showing me the fe-, she had a fence, she had a stairway, she had, uh, some broccoli, some plastic broccoli, and sh-, and we were there. We were, it was a mind melt of, um, of that world, exactly what you're describing. And this, this seemed like such an intent and sacred space to be in with a kid. 

00:36:50
MARTHA STRAUS That's so great. And she let you into it. I mean, the other piece of this is, um, it's private but it's also, uh, vis-, it's a way to visit it is a whole other experience. And so kids are playing alone. They play in the presence of others, they play with others, they play under the supervision of others they supervise. I mean, there's a richness in all of these different forms of play. And one of the things, for example, uh, in kids who feel very disconnected from adults and from their parents and, who are in just play therapy, just play therapy. Here I'm even saying it, that they play. I'm watching them play and at first they might be very isolated by it, but slowly I ask questions and suggest things and wonder things. And they know I'm there and so they go from this isola-, isolation of play to this playing in the presence of play, and then I can gradually also become more active so then they're playing with me. And then with or without their parents, I can mentor parents and show them how and consult with parents and coach them so that they can have this amazing experience of entering their child's world. And we don't. We want the kids to come into our world. And good luck. God bless you, because they can't. 

00:38:15
RICH SIMON So that, the skill there, it seems to me, if the sense that it's, quote, a skill, and, and, and I think initially maybe it's more of a willingness. It's a temporal thing, it's a slowing down. And then there's just this tracking of letting the child guide you into wherever, there, the kid is gonna go. However halting that may be and for some kids it's, it's, it's, it's much more difficult I would think than for others. But for, it's just that tracking and the main thing is just sort of that, that, uh... 

00:38:45
MARTHA STRAUS The presence of it, yeah. And therapy will help them... 

00:38:50
RICH SIMON And, and the slowing down of the viewpoint of the willingness to enter into that different world. Then, then, uh, adult, the adult rhythm of life usually leads us into. 

00:39:00
MARTHA STRAUS When, when Piaget used to visit the United States, he would always get a question from the audience, uh, asking, uh, how we could speed up development from concrete operational to farmer[ph] operational funds. And he would say, what is it with you Americans. Why do you want to speed up the process. To me it's such a great question, because we, what about childhood, what about this. It is slow. And some people don't want, aren't drawn to child work because there's a tedium to it also. You know, putting something together for 20 minutes. Yeah, right. I mean, and you have to really work the intentional and presence in the same gauge in a way you might now if you're just having an adult conversation. But it opens up a vista of what's happening internally for the child so much more effectively over time than getting them to try to describe that internal landscape that they're not even necessarily consciously aware of. 

00:40:00
RICH SIMON So, talk to us a bit about how you take, so there's this one element is the therapist and the self of the therapist and your willingness and your ability to slow yourself down and to adapt and track the kid and all that stuff. And then, uh, i-i-i, and is there more in terms of the training of therapists to, to me it seems, then, from there all kinds of things happen. Is there, in your training or in the training that you do with your trainees, with your students, is there something, is there another element that you wo-would wanna emphasize for us. 

00:40:35
MARTHA STRAUS I'm gonna quote Bob Dylan, this will age me right now, date me right now, uh, I was so much older than I'm younger than that now. I mean, I think that the, one of the things that I'm working on, especially with the younger students, is letting them not know what the hell is going on. Giving them a lot of permission and encouragement to be clueless. And, uh, be bewildered and curious, uh, in some uncertain holding that ambiguity in the room, like, I don't know what's going on here. What am I, who am I to this child. What do I mean. What, what is my, uh, you know, counter-transfer. What is my experience being in the room with this child. What's that like for me for him, you know. And so I'm really encouraging this, um, suspension of, uh, having to know what's happening. That's kind of what play is about because it unfolds, right. And sometimes it folds slowly and repetitively. And so, like, you know, with time-lapse photography within a single session maybe know what just happened. But then they come back to that exact, I mean, this happens so much. People don't believe this until they start doing it. The child remembers where he, she left off. She goes right for the thing that she hasn't finish-, if she hasn't finished. Whatever the thing is and she sets the dollhouse back up or the game, or he sets the game back up exactly where it was. And I'm old. I don't remember, you know. But they, they remember it. They're holding it. And that placeholder is incredibly important to this unfolding narrative through the metaphor of play. And it is, it is slow. So, and it is, uh, uh, tremendously unhinging for somebody who doesn't have much memory of their own playful-, or didn't play very much as a kid. So it helps to have memories of, of childhood and childhood play. For those who don't, they're at a disadvantage during play therapy. 

00:42:40
RICH SIMON Or, unless the kid can reawaken that in them. So now ho-, let, let's bring these two worlds together for us. So, you're the family therapist, you're trained in, in this, we, we don't have a lot of, uh, perhaps, Virginia, even Virginia Satir, as you mentioned, didn't do a lot of play with kids in the session. Though she, she di-, she was a, a, a, you know, an all-accepting presence... 

00:43:00
MARTHA STRAUS And the enactments were very playful. 

00:43:05
RICH SIMON Very playful, yeah. 

00:43:05
MARTHA STRAUS In a respectful way. 

00:43:05
RICH SIMON A lot of fun. Yeah. 

00:43:05
MARTHA STRAUS Sam Whitaker did, uh... 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON So, so, as you, how do you pull together the, your, the family therapy orientation and this, your facility with play and your, uh, your, your, all your experience with it. Do those, how do those come together when you're, when that's appropriate and when do they come together then you're at work. 

00:43:25
MARTHA STRAUS Um, I'm trying to think of specif-, I have a few specific... 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON Well, you told me about the picnic session, for example. 

00:43:30
MARTHA STRAUS Yeah, I thought that... 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON Picnic is a great example. 

00:43:35
MARTHA STRAUS I have a story to tell you which is an adolescent's story. Um, about a family picnic and I also want to tell, um, a y-, a story with younger kids about a family drawing project that we did. So that would be two examples. The, the third that I won't get into right now is more dyadic, m-more, uh, like Dan Hughes does, um, where I am really coaching parents and, um, consulting with parents in playing with their children. So I'm kind of outside. I might play the game with them but I might sit outside it and give the parents suggestions about how to respond and what to do. Um, so, but I, that's a whole other way of thinking about it. So, um, I have a, this example which is very recent. This is a kid who just turned 18 and, uh, she's a very, very sensitive, uh, young woman and so sensitive that she can't tolerate or hasn't been able to tolerate for many years now, eating a meal with her parents because her mother's chewing is extremely stressing to her. Right. I mean, and she's serious. It's funny to us, right. But to her... 

00:44:45
RICH SIMON We've all had moments like that, especially when we were teenagers, yeah. 

00:44:50
MARTHA STRAUS I mean, now, she sort of gets the, I've been working with her for about six months, and she now sees, uh, she gets her own joke a little bit that her hypersensitivities are almost funny at times, even to her. But this is one of them and it has caused a pretty big rupture in family life. Because, uh, she's living at home and, uh, they family can't have a meal together. And I want them to. The research on family meals is phenomenal to correlational research. I mean, it is associated with all good outcomes. The more family dinners you have the better the outcomes. I mean, it's really amazing research. Uh, that's out there. So, it's important to me and the ritual of it, and the coming together of it and th-the potential for play of it and they, what traditionally happens is this, and it's what happened with this family. I see the adolescent, I see the parents, I occasionally see them all together when I'm feeling strong. And I'm pushing hard in this early on in having them have a meal together once a week. That she's feeling lonely and missing them, that they don't really know who she is. They're very anxious about her because they don't know what she's up to. It's a win-win in my mind. Have a meal. Everybody's got to eat. So, weeks go by where I'm hammering on this and they, something comes up and something else comes up and they don't do it. Finally, and this has happened in some variation before to me with this same assignment, when they finally do come in and they're furious at me because they did what I asked them to and it was a complete nightmare. They fought the whole time, people stomped out, it's worse than ever, and that was my brilliant intervention. So in this case, what I decided to do, because I'm still hammering on it even though it has failed, which I guess is kind of humorous of me, too, you know, but expecting a different outcome. But I said, okay. Here's the deal. The problem here is that it's been so long it's like a muscle. The family dinner is like a muscle. You've got to practice to get it strong. Um, clearly you don't know what you're doing. Come in, bring me a picnic. I'm gonna have dinner with you, you, on you. So they bring in, and I sit in, say, don't have it all assembled. Bring in, like, parts of a meal. Like, cold cuts and sandwich-y stuff, so we have to make the meal together, too. Okay. So, I send them on their way. And, uh, they come in with, you know, cold cuts in bags and gyro bread and all that kind of thing and sna-, and beverages and cups and, you know, they do the assignment. And they don't know how to ask, how to, they don't know how to do it. I mean, things that may be in your generation, my generation, we took, uh, for granted. Like, you say, how was your day. And you don't get derailed by the way someone is chewing, right. So I'm working with the child, uh, the adolescent very closely to keep her in, you know, regulated enough to do this. And it ends up being very interesting and informative. So I would model something and then I'd say, okay, you try it. And it was all in good play, and it was fun and sharing food and passing things, taking turns, and not ea-, and not speaking with your mouth full, and kinds of conversations that families could have, who haven't seen each other in four years, which is the way it sort of felt for them. And so that's one, uh, playful, uh, intervention, I think, that would be a way to really practice something that is important that they're not going to practice on their own because it's too daunting and hard. So that's, that's the family, the family picnic example. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON And, so, where did it lead. So, so, by the end of that session, what were you seeing in the room and what's your sense of how that got transferred out in whatever way that you were able to determine that. 

00:48:50
MARTHA STRAUS They've had, this is, this was a few months ago. I think they've had two or three family meals together since then. Because I noodle on it. I'm not pressing it the same way I was. But they're, it's gotten a little bit better. And they seem to, she seems to be less upset by her mother's chewing at a restaurant of her choosing. She was willing to concede that. So they have, they've gone out two or three times to eat. I think eating at home intensity, uh, food, I don't know. Anyway. The kid's running the show. But they're doing it more and they left, I think, they left in a much better place than they came in. It was fun. It was, it was, it was very amusing. I was amused the whole time. I was laughing. 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON And they could laugh some at, at the, at these conflicts and the shrillness that came out of, seemingly out of nowhere. 

00:49:40
MARTHA STRAUS Right. Right. They were all kind of showing me what the other, you know, this was what, what, in family therapy people wanna show that they're not the problem, the other person is. So they're going to great lengths to be the lighter one and to, you know, so, I, and I had a good enough relationship because of this model I'm talking about where I had relationships with all the players, so I was able to do that. Um, so, uh, go, the other example that I wanted to, to just mention, is having the family draw something together on one of those huge flip-chart pads. And I had a family come in which, uh, was a family that had a father who traveled for work, uh, and the mom and two kids, one of whom, uh, was uh, kind of a budding O.C.D., a lot of anxiety, uh, pretty incapacitated, um, by it. And a lot of worry about the dad who was away a lot, too, I mean, she was focused on is he going to be okay, he's flying, a lot of that kind of thing. And a mom who was spending an amazing amount of mental real estate worrying about her anxious child. So I had that information on hand and about session three they all came in, the four of them. So it was like a 12 year old, a 10 year old, and both parents. And I had out on the floor this big pad and some magic markers. And I said, I-I want to just see something here, to understand and help you understand what's happening for you all better. And here's the assignment. It's like a-a family kinetic family drawing. So I want you to each decide what animal you would be if you were to be an animal. Doesn't have to be in the same animal family. Just, who is your true animal self. And then I want you to figure that out, and then come up with a story in which all of you would be doing something together and draw it. And then tell me the story. So at that point, I just sit back and I'm looking at um, who monopolizes, who takes turns, how they select what animal they're going to be, um, how they org-, who organizes the task for the drawing, who is more reluctant, you know, I'm just looking at structure and commu-, all the things that we're trained to look at in family therapy. But it's hard to see it because when you're dealing with younger kids, it's hard to, to see it because you're talking about it as opposed to doing it. I really believe, and this is my biggest take home on this that I tell my students, every time something happens that's real in the room, is way more effective than if you're, they're just talking about it happening outside of the room. That's true in individual therapy, but it's really true in family work. So these enactments and, and playing together, you really see them, again, in a less defended, uh, controlled state because they're playing together. And so they, they decide that they're going to do a picture of them at the dinner table, actually, it so happens. And this father says that he is a tiger. And, independently of that, the daughter who is preoccupied says that she is a kitten. And the mom is a chicken, and the younger sibling is a rabbit, right. And so they come up with this whole thing and then we have a discussion afterwards. And I say, so that's interesting, you know, you guys, the daughter and the dad, you're in the same family. And they talk about that. And then, then one of them says, yeah, and we eat. Isn't that great. And then they have a disc-, it's all within the metaphor, right. I don't say it, this means, you know, that your aggression, aggressive, and, I just let them play it out and have a conversation about it. Oh, ha, and it's playful and it's connective. The daughter and the father are connecting. The mother is seeing her vulnerability in this situation, and maybe even down the road her vulnerability given a stronger alliance between the daughter and the father. I mean, there are a lot of pieces in this to, to unfold. And they apparently talked about it a great deal in the intervening couple of weeks. So by the time I saw them again the next time, it, they had a different self-story, integrated story about who they were and what their relationships were and what this little kitten's anxiety was and how it would be if the lion, if the tiger, excuse me, protected her more. And so on, I mean, within the play, within the metaphor of the play. I didn't have to say in some structural, strategic way that the dad needed to get more engaged. I didn't have to go through all that because they enacted it, playfully. 

00:54:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. Okay. So we just have a, a few minutes here, and um, so as, as, as you, uh, as we've been focusing here on this, this cavalcade of family therapy across the decades and, uh, looking back on our salad days as young crusading family therapists and dealing with the realities of, uh, of, of practice today. Um, so i-i-in addition to this principle of somebody watching this now i-in terms of their, expanding their own capacity. We talked about this importance of, uh, connecting with parents early on, moving outside the language, just verbal language if you're really gonna have a, a, quote, conversation, an interaction that engages all generations within the family. So some, wh-what's a, a, is there something else you wanna leave us with that perhaps you leave with your students about. How do people grow and, and expand their therapeutic effectiveness in working with kids and families. Is there something else from your experience that stands out here that you might want to emphasize with this audience. 

00:55:40
MARTHA STRAUS Yeah. Um, I guess I want to talk about love. Um, is that okay. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON You can, okay. Nobody I'd rather hear talk about it than you. 

00:55:45
MARTHA STRAUS You know, I-I, to me the real take home here is that, um, except for the most damaged and bewildered parents, and even they love their children too, you know, that parents love their kids and their capacity to engage with their children has been, um, impeded by a lot of cultural messages that they're getting and they are reified by our expertise. So they don't know what to do with their child and they bring him to an expert. And it's an act of disempowerment and disengagement. And it might be that they're so burned out they just want someone else to fix it, I mean, I'm not getting into motivation entirely. It is true and that I tell my students and, um, they've practiced this, is that if you meet with the child and conform empathy and connection with the child and you go in and say to the parents not in a cheesy formulaic way, but what a great kid you have. Wow. I just love your kid, in some way that you can do that that's authentic. The parents, you can watch them down-regulate before your eyes. And they're available because they're not being blamed because their child isn't damaged and unlovable. They, I mean, there's a cascade factor that happens through our ability to, um, value a, a child. And to free a parent up to have that experience of their child that they're, uh, feeling disempowered or disengaged or angry or frustrated or terrified or, um, blamed. I mean, all of these terrible negative feelings that we have when our children are not doing well. And pressure is on these parents. If you, I'm seeing a lot of anxious kids and they have anxious parents to a child. So, what we're trying to do is to support the parents and, um, love the parents too and not get in, no matter how we proceed, not get into a power struggle with the parents over whose kids they are. Um, try to rescue the children from their parents, but to help widen the circle. I think that is my, my biggest point, and secure love works. The more love we have, the better we do. 

00:58:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. What a lovely note to end this conversation with. So, um, I will point out to folks yet again. We have our comment board. Uh, we, we are very interested in hearing what you do with this conversation that happened today and continue this conversation on through in, in your own practices or own lives. Also, Martha with her usual graciousness has agreed to visit our comment board where appropriate and respond to questions or comments. Um, now, uh, Martha, l-last thing, so i-in terms of trainings and resources for people who want to find out more about your work, and want to explore this domain of play therapy and family therapy in its, its twenty-first century, the twenty-first century face of family therapy. Um, you have a, a website.
