00:00:50
With Michelle Anderson Andrew Maier & Dr Mary Graham 

00:00:50

00:01:30

00:01:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but the cop didn't go to prison.

Role-Play 1 Sarah - 22 year old under-graduate 

00:01:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well Sarah you're mother called and my, I met her, she wanted to make sure you came, uh, she suggested you, you come here, huh? 

00:01:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON More like she told me to come. 

00:01:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING She told you to come. Okay. And uh, what did she have in mind when she wanted you to come? 

00:01:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON She wants me to do what she wants me to do. 

00:02:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. And uh, so what, how did she tell you? What did she say? 

00:02:05
Michelle Anderson 

00:02:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON She said I'm footing the bill for your education . . . 

00:02:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:02:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . .and I think you're getting into some trouble, so you're gonna do this for me or you won't be finishing up . . . 

00:02:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh. 

00:02:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . .your degree. 

00:02:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. So that's pretty serious huh? 

00:02:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON In her mind, yeah. 

00:02:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and what does she think you're doing? 

00:02:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON I guess she thinks I'm getting into trouble. Maybe doing drugs, or something, even though I tell her I'm not. 

00:02:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. But she thinks you are. 

00:02:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:02:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Do the campus police think you're doing this too? 

00:02:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. I've never been picked up by campus police or anything like that. 

00:02:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Mm-hm. But, uh, has your mother found anything that uh, she thinks is drugs? 

00:02:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. 

00:02:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. So what's the problem here? I don't quite get it. 

00:02:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well she called me one night kind of late actually. For her I'd have thought she been in bed . . . 

00:02:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:02:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . .it was maybe only like 11:00, and you know I had some loud friends in the background and there was some drinking going on and we were getting ready for a party. And she just stopped, I shouldn't be doing that. I think that's really what sent her over the. . . 

00:03:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:03:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . edge. 

00:03:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. And this was in your, uh, apartment . . . 

00:03:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:03:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . .that you had the party. 

00:03:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. I have a room mate. 

00:03:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. And how many people were there? 

00:03:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Maybe like ten or fifteen. 

00:03:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Hm. So what did she think was going on? People taking drugs? 

00:03:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mad orgies, and I don't know. 

00:03:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. So she's pretty upset with you? 

00:03:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:03:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. So what, where do you go from here? I mean, sounds like she's gonna cut off your money or something so, yeah. 

00:03:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean I guess I'll just do what she wants me to do, you know. So I can get out of the house, which will be soon, but . . . 

00:03:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING When? 

00:03:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Oh, as soon as I graduate I'm out of there. 

00:03:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And when will you graduate? 

00:03:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Uh, mid may, so I have another semester to go. 

00:03:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. So let me ask you this, uh, what do you need to change this afternoon so that you can graduate? Assuming you want to. 

00:04:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON Oh, I wanna graduate. What do I need to change? 

00:04:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:04:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Um, I mean I guess I really want my mom to change. 

00:04:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. I can't blame you for that. Trouble with moms is that they're moms. 

00:04:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:04:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Did you want me to try to work on her to get her to change? 

00:04:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON Can you do that? 

00:04:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I wouldn't begin to know how. I mean I can call her or something like that if you wanted me to, but, and I don't know what good that would do. 

00:04:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Hm. Maybe I should call her. 

00:04:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well it sounds like she needs some convincing. 

00:04:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. Convincing that I'm not getting in trouble. 

00:05:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. So you're saying you're not in trouble, or you're not doing anything inappropriate that she . . . 

00:05:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean I'm not, I mean I'm not just like out in the street, you know . . . 

00:05:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:05:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . .like she seems to think. But I mean, you know, I can probably party a little more than . . . 

00:05:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you're not taking drugs out on the street or . . . 

00:05:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Uh-uh. 

00:05:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . cocaine or . . . 

00:05:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON No, no. 

00:05:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . or any of the big league stuff . . . 

00:05:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. 

00:05:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . or whatever. 

00:05:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Just a little drinking here and there. 

00:05:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING A little drinking, yeah, okay. So, but she thinks it's a big problem. 

00:05:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:05:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. And you don't think it's a problem at all. 

00:05:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. I mean I keep my grades up, I go to class, I always like all the people who come along, who come to the parties. 

00:05:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. I mean how many would you say you had in the last two weeks? 

00:05:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Probably like five. 

00:05:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh. Five. So almost every other night? 

00:05:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:05:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean those are just the ones you counted. 

00:06:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:06:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. So almost every other night, and probably maybe on the weekends every night. I mean I'm just kind of going on what I know about college. . . 

00:06:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:06:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . students. 

00:06:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Absolutely. 

00:06:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING There, there are these rumors about college students having parties, you know. 

00:06:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, I've heard those. 

00:06:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So, um, let's put it this way. The way you're going now, with all these, you know five, six, seven parties every two weeks, the way you're headed is that in the direction of getting her off of your back? Or is it in the direction of going out the door? You know, not graduating. 

00:06:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON Definitely the . . . 

00:06:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Out the door? 

00:06:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . out the door. 

00:06:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Alright. Is that what you want to happen? 

00:06:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. 

00:06:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So where does this leave you? 

00:06:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean I need to keep my mom happy, so she'll get off my back. 

00:06:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. I mean if you don't have a problem, Sarah, and she thinks you have a problem, is that more of a problem or less of a problem for you? 

00:07:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON More of a problem. 

00:07:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:07:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON 'Cause she'll keep nagging me about it. 

00:07:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. Uh, I don't, I don't need to make a judgment about who's right or who's wrong here. Uh, but what the point is that if you don't have what she thinks is a problem, but she thinks it's a problem, then It seems to me that you have twice as much work to do. 

00:07:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. And she's not listening to me. 

00:07:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh. 

00:07:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON That's how I ended up here. 

00:07:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING How many times does she call? 

00:07:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON I talk to her at least once a day, but when she called the last time that was like her surprise call. 

00:07:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. She called at night. 

00:07:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:07:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Did she ever call at night other than that time? 

00:07:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. 

00:07:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So this is a big concern for her. 

00:07:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:07:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Must be, she must be pretty anxious I guess the word is, huh? 

00:07:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON You can call it anxious, I'd say she's a little crazy. 

00:08:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, yeah, but crazy or not, she's concerned. 

00:08:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:08:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING What do-, what does that do to you when you know you're mother's concerned? 

00:08:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean it makes me feel bad, I don't, I don't want her to worry or to feel like I'm making her worry. 

00:08:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Well if continue to do what you're doing is it going to help you get her off you're back or is it going, or is it going to create more anxiety for her, less anxiety. What's going to happen? 

00:08:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON You know, it will make her more worry. 

00:08:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hm. I've got another question, kind of a different question. 

00:08:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:08:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Um, any of these questions I ask you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I just ask a lot of questions. One of them is, uh, have any of your friends ever said, 'Sarah, you know, you're drinking too much.' Or, 'You're having too many parties.' Or, they ever said anything like that to you?' 

00:09:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON No. Most of my friends party more than me. 

00:09:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING They, they party as m-, more than you do. Yeah. Suppose somebody that didn't party much but were, they were kind of in the honors program, and they were like studying day and night. What would they say? 

00:09:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, they would say I'm partying a lot. 

00:09:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Would they say you're partying too much? 

00:09:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON I don''t know. 

00:09:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, just guess. 

00:09:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Maybe, yeah. 

00:09:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Maybe. Yeah. So there would be some opinion floating around that, that you're doing too much? 

00:09:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:09:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Got another question that might not seem to have anything to do with this. Do you have any friends that are kind of like not partiers? 

00:09:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Not really. 

00:09:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING 'Cause I mean, you're quite amazing that you can keep your grades up and go to all these parties every night. 

00:10:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well, as a Senior I'm not taking the hardest classes, you know. 

00:10:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but you're still getting good grades, which I think is really quite admirable. 

00:10:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well, Bs. 

00:10:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's pretty good. 

00:10:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:10:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING There's only one grade higher than that. 

00:10:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, but I used to get one grade higher . . . 

00:10:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Did you? 

00:10:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . .before I started . . . 

00:10:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. 

00:10:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . hanging out. 

00:10:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Okay. You want to get back to that one grade higher? 

00:10:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Sometimes I do, I try not to think about it too much though. 

00:10:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, do you want to make any changes or do you want to keep going the way you are? 

00:10:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean I do want to make a change. I don't want my mom to call me again . . . 

00:10:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:10:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . .and freak out. 

00:10:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, what's she going to do if she calls you? What's she going to say? 

00:10:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well if she calls and I'm doing the same thing she's going to say, 'You know you're not doing the the spring semester, you'll do it closer to home,' or something. 

00:11:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. So she's really serious about this. 

00:11:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:11:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well it seems to me you've got a choice in it. You can, you can go down the road you're going down, which seems to be a troublesome road, you said that, I think. As far as graduating and that. 

00:11:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:11:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's fun, but I mean, I'm just talking about graduating. 

00:11:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:11:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Or you can make a change that you know I know you're mother, you don't think she's uh, you know, will, real uh, solid about this, but she is your mother, she's paying bills. 

00:11:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON That's true. 

00:11:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So you can go down that road. Or you could continue down the one you're on, it's up to you. 

00:11:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON I definitely want to finish school. 

00:11:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well, what do you need to do this afternoon to work on it? 

00:12:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON I guess maybe not party so much. 

00:12:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's pretty tentative I guess not party so much. There's two cations that you're giving yourself there. I mean it's up to you, I can't force you to do this. You know, I'd like to see you stay, I'd like to see you graduate, and um, you think your mother's the problem, I know that. But um, you do want to graduate regardless of, of her attitude. 

00:12:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. And she would probably be nicer to be if I wasn't partying so much. 

00:12:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, that's for sure. Let me ask you this, this is a really serious question. I mean, without kidding yourself, do you think that let's say, party every night, and these aren't just a half hour party, I mean, right, these are . . . 

00:13:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON No it's . . . 

00:13:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING These are party . . . 

00:13:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:13:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . with a capital 'p'. 

00:13:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:13:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Right, right. And who, whatever, okay, just the partying, whatever happens there we have, I'm not asking you about it, but the point is um, uh, twoo a week or I mean, uh two every other night. Or more. Right? 

00:13:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON On the weekend maybe. 

00:13:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think this I mean deep down inside, do you think this is kind of the way it ought to be, or to, or not? 

00:13:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean I feel like in the real world, no. 

00:13:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:13:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON So I figured I should just get it all in before I leave and go out into the real world. 

00:13:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but the, the, the concern that I hear is you're going to be leaving soon. 

00:13:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I thought you said you don't want that. 

00:13:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well I wanna, I wanna graduate, I wanna finish . . . 

00:14:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:14:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . and I want everything to be you know, good. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, if I talk to you next week, what do you think we'll be talking about? 

00:14:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean I guess it kind of depends on me. 

00:14:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but as you sit here now, what do you think it would be? 

00:14:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well I want to say my mom's not as worried. 

00:14:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Hm. 

00:14:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Which probably means maybe only like partying on the weekends. And I can tell her that I'm partying less, and that would be true. 

00:14:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm, mm-hm. So do you want to make a change or do you not want to make this kind of a change? I mean considering everything. Considering, you know, the real world, the not so real world, you're considering your mother's attitude toward this and paying the bills, and what you told me earlier about whether it's a good idea, all, all of those things, what do you think? 

00:15:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON I think I have to, I have to do something different. 

00:15:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Have to? 

00:15:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well, if I wanted to be different, then I have to make a different decision. 

00:15:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Yeah. Mm-hm. When? 

00:15:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Honestly? 

00:15:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:15:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Tonight, I would have to tell my friends I'm not hanging out with them . . . 

00:15:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:15:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . or like . . . 

00:15:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:15:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . Wednesday night. 

00:15:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. How hard would that be? 

00:15:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON It'll be pretty hard . . . 

00:15:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:15:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON . . . 'cause their going to try to say, 'Oh, come on, come out.' 

00:15:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah Yeah. Um, How would you, do you want to do that? 

00:15:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, cause I want to, I mean I want to stay in school, I want to finish. 

00:16:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe you could, I mean this is just an idea, Sara, that just came to my mind. Maybe you could just do this for practice. Call off tonight's party just for practice. 

00:16:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON What do you mean for practice. 

00:16:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well see how it goes. Calling your friends and saying, 'I'm not going to, I'm not going to be there tonight. I'm not going to be in my apartment tonight. I'm going to be somewhere else, and then you don't tell them where, but maybe you go to the library . . .' 

00:16:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON At the library. 

00:16:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You know. To many parties there. 

00:16:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Ha, ha, no. No parties. 

00:16:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. I didn't think so. Or somewhere, I don't know, where would you go? 

00:16:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON Maybe like a coffee shop. I like to study in the coffee shop. 

00:16:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And, do you? 

00:16:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:16:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And you, so there's no drinking accept coffee, in places like that. Usually, unless you bring it in. But I assume you, you, I don't know, you, something. But the point is, um, what do you think about just kind of doing this one night just for practice? 

00:16:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON I can do that. 

00:17:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Can you do that? 

00:17:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:17:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean I'm asking would it satiny you inside, that's my question. Or are you just doing it to, because you think that's what I want to hear. 

00:17:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON No, if it really like if I could really tell my mom, I didn't party . . . 

00:17:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:17:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON You know I actually studied on a weeknight. 

00:17:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:17:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON That would be good. 

00:17:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Did you have one scheduled tonight? 

00:17:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON What? 

00:17:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Party. 

00:17:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well you know, a few people said they would drop by. 

00:17:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Drop by, and then a few more drop by and pretty soon, you got a lot of drops. 

00:17:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. A whole house full. 

00:17:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING A whole house full of drops. Okay, so uh, we do, I mean I'm just trying, throwing this out, see if you want to give it a try. 

00:17:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON So no pressure. 

00:17:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No pre-, what do you mean? 

00:17:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Like you're not gonna say you have to do this, or you should do this. 

00:17:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No, it's a question of do you want to? Would it satisfy you inside? That's the point. 

00:18:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON It would. 

00:18:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean you do want to stay in school, right? 

00:18:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yep, it would. 

00:18:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean I thought you made that real clear. 

00:18:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:18:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. So who would you c-, who would you call first? 

00:18:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON My roommate. 

00:18:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, the roommate, okay. Um, hm. Who would you call second? 

00:18:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON My best friend. 

00:18:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You're best friend. And who would you call third? 

00:18:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON The guy I'm kind of seeing, because he usually brings the guys over. 

00:18:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I see. He brings in the whole team. 

00:18:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:18:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING The whole band. Okay. So uh, you know their numbers?

ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do you want to give them a call now? 

00:18:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Okay. 

00:18:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So you would call your roommate first? 

00:18:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON My roommate first. 

00:18:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. And uh, you would call your best friend second, and you would call your boyfriend third? And uh, tell them what? 

00:19:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON Tell them I'm not going to party tonight, I want to, I want to do right by my mom, and I don't want her to be mad. 

00:19:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Well okay. Now, suppose we practice that first phone call. 

00:19:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON Okay. 

00:19:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. And I'll be your roommate. Okay so give me a call, and what's my name?

ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Nancy? Okay, so you call me. 

00:19:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Hey Nancy, what's going on? 

00:19:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Not much, I'm looking forward to tonight. 

00:19:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. That's kinda what I called to talk about. 

00:19:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah? 

00:19:35
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, you know my mom's really been stressing me lately, right? 

00:19:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah, well you've been handling that okay. 

00:19:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON Well I really kind of haven't because she's really serious and she won't pay for school and stuff. 

00:19:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, that's all talk, she's going to pay, she's not going to stop paying at this stage. 

00:19:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON She seemed really mad, you remember when she called the other night. 

00:19:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, well she'll get over that. 

00:19:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON I don't think so, I don't know. 

00:20:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well you always said she's a little crazy anyway. 

00:20:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean she is. 

00:20:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:20:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON But she's still my mom. 

00:20:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well what time we going to party? 

00:20:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON I don't think I'm going to be partying. 

00:20:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING What? 

00:20:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON I mean not tonight anyway. 

00:20:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, how did that go for you? And we'll just cut . . . 

00:20:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON It was harder than I thought it was going to be. 

00:20:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Harder than you thought, but see you now, that when you really do it you won't have done it for the, for the first time. 

00:20:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON That's true. 'Cause I wanted to party. 

00:20:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Oh sure. People don't, don't usually go to parties because they you know, they want to get punished, they go because it's going to be enjoyable. Can I just add one thing to what you did? 

00:20:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Mm-hm. 

00:20:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, I'll be you now, and I, let's say I said all the things up to this point. 

00:20:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Okay. 

00:20:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Um, Nancy, uh, I've, I've decided no party tonight. Absolutely not. 

00:21:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON No party? 

00:21:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, because of everything I just told you. 

00:21:05
MICHELLE ANDERSON I don't know. It's going to be a good party. 

00:21:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well I'm not going to be there. 

00:21:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON All the guys are going to be there. 

00:21:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING They can be there, but I'm not. 

00:21:15
MICHELLE ANDERSON You sound really serious. 

00:21:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I'm dead serious. Okay, what was the difference? 

00:21:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON You were really serious. 

00:21:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING See the way you did it, I'm not saying what you did was wrong, I'm just saying the only thing I added was I left out the word, 'I think I'm not going to have a party.' I just used the word absolutely. 

00:21:40
MICHELLE ANDERSON So you can't be on the fence, huh? 

00:21:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's a good way to put it, I never thought about that, that's a good way to put it. 

00:21:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON This is harder than I thought it was going to be. 

00:21:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING But you already did it once quite well. Now we could practice together two calls, but I think you pretty much got that. 

00:22:00
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, my roommate, if I can handle her. 

00:22:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Just practice with me and say absolutely no party. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Absolutely no party. 

00:22:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well you sound convinced about that Sarah. You know what I was thinking the same thing. I don't know if she'll say that or not. She might not, who knows. 

00:22:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON That would be cool if she said that. 

00:22:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, our times about up Sarah, but one more thing before you leave. And I almost forgot this, um, when you're at the coffee shop, could you call my number here at the office and leave a message as to how it went when you called your friends? The other friends I mean. 

00:22:45
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah. 

00:22:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You can call the other two here if you want, it's up to you. 

00:22:50
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yeah, I could call them, 

00:22:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING But, uh, I'd like to know how, how it went. And how long they stayed at the coffee shop and that sort of thing. 

00:22:55
MICHELLE ANDERSON Nobody's ever said that before. 

00:23:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Just leave a message. I won't be in the office, but leave like a ten second message, and I'll get the message tomorrow. Or in fact, I'll get it tonight. I'll call for my messages tonight. 

00:23:10
MICHELLE ANDERSON Now if I completely flop, do I call too. 

00:23:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Call anyway, yeah. Okay, uh, you want to shake hands on this, it means you're really going to do this now, you're not just talking. 

00:23:20
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. I'll shake hands on it. 

00:23:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It means, It means I'm going to call for my messages tonight too.

ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, you ready? 

00:23:25
MICHELLE ANDERSON Yes. 

00:23:25

00:23:30
MICHELLE ANDERSON Okay. 

00:23:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Alright.

00:27:50
ANDREW MAIER My family kind of I mean this is, they've never done this before. I mean they've never slammed the door, I mean they've been hanging up the phone. Usually, you know I could find a way to get in the house. I mean they . . . 

00:28:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:28:00
ANDREW MAIER I'm calling friends and they're hanging up on me. Grandma even hung up on me. I don't. So this has been kind of . . . 

00:28:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So they're pretty upset with you? 

00:28:10
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I mean they haven't talked to me in two months. 

00:28:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Really? 

00:28:15

00:28:25
ANDREW MAIER I mean what are they saying? 

00:28:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well they're saying pretty much what you kind of said they're saying. They're hanging up. They just said we're about ready to hang up on him permanently and throw him out period. I mean they're not thrilled with what they think you've been doing. I mean would you agree that what you're doing is what they say you're doing? Or are you . . . 

00:28:50
ANDREW MAIER They're, they're, I mean, they probably took it a little further than . . . I mean they sort of exaggerate sometimes, I mean . . . 

00:29:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well let's give you an example of, of how they exaggerate. When they describe what, what they think you are doing. 

00:29:05
ANDREW MAIER Well I mean they'll they'll say I never do anything for the family. I mean it's like they say never, you know it's like, but I help sometimes. I stop by and you know I, I, I help my dad with the car. I'm sort of handy with that kind of stuff. It's like they say never, never around, you don't care about us anymore. But I do care. They say I don't care . . . 

00:29:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah actually the way you're putting it is kind of gentle. They're much more uh, vehe-, vehement in what they say. 

00:29:45
ANDREW MAIER What's that mean? 

00:29:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, like, some of the language they used wa-, was, you know like, if we never see him again it will be too soon. 

00:30:05
ANDREW MAIER God. 

00:30:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean they put it in kind of a, more graphic language. Especially your dad. 

00:30:10
ANDREW MAIER Rea-? 

00:30:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well he said he's told you these things. 

00:30:25

00:30:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:30:30
ANDREW MAIER They say things all the time and then they back, you know. 

00:30:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING They back down because you're their son. 

00:30:35
ANDREW MAIER I know they mean it this time, because they're, I mean . . . 

00:30:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I think that maybe you're right. 

00:30:40
ANDREW MAIER I'm try-. 

00:30:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I think maybe you're right. But you know, but they hang up on you, right . . .

ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And when they come and visit you what do you think they want to hear? 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:15
ANDREW MAIER To be honest with you, I don't think they want to hear anything. I don't think they want to even talk to me. 

00:31:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but we try to involve families. 

00:31:20
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:31:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING We have these family groups, and. . . 

00:31:25

00:31:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, there's no doubt in my mind I can convince them. 

00:31:30
ANDREW MAIER And you think they'd listen to me? 

00:31:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, I can't say that. Sometimes when they come to these meetings we help them deal with cutting the strings from their relative who's here. 

00:31:45
ANDREW MAIER Hm. 

00:31:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING We help them feel good about never seeing . . . 

00:31:45
ANDREW MAIER What do you mean, what do you mean cut the strings? What do you, strings . . . 

00:31:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Kicking your ass out. That's sometimes what we have to do. 

00:31:55
ANDREW MAIER You must have already talked to them. I mean they . . . 

00:31:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah. 

00:31:55
ANDREW MAIER . . . they, but they've already I mean before I even came here it seems like you talked to them. 

00:32:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:32:00
ANDREW MAIER You did? 

00:32:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure we did the screening. 

00:32:00
ANDREW MAIER I didn't think I was talking to my family. It was like a different person. 

00:32:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:32:05
ANDREW MAIER They were. What did you do to them? 

00:32:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING We said we're going to help you, the family, make your decisions that satisfying to you. But see that's where they start, we try to and sometimes that's what we have to do is help them cut those strings, but that's not our first choice. Our first choice is to reconcile. You know what I mean by that? Bring the person who is here, in this case the son and the brother, as you are, to bring the family together so that they can kind of . . . 

00:32:35
ANDREW MAIER My brother's going to come? 

00:32:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah. If he'll come, he'll be here. We, we try to get him. 

00:32:45
ANDREW MAIER He's gonna, he's gonna leave college and he's going to come . . . 

00:32:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well when he comes we'll see him. We won't if he can't make it. We deal with whoever shows up. 

00:32:55
ANDREW MAIER (inaudible ) I'm just so surprised he'd come. I'm surprised he'd come. 

00:33:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, we try to talk him into it. 

00:33:00
ANDREW MAIER He is, he stopped . . . 

00:33:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Now . . . 

00:33:00
ANDREW MAIER . . . talking to me a long time ago. 

00:33:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh. Yeah. Yeah. So let me ask you this, do you want to reconcile, do you want to get along with your family better? 

00:33:10
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:33:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, you're . . . 

00:33:10
ANDREW MAIER I just don't, I don't know if uh, if I can. It's just you know . . . 

00:33:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:33:20
ANDREW MAIER . . . I mean I've really screwed up. You know. I mean I want them to know this time is different, you know, it really is, it's like I, but they've, you know, they've heard that all before. It's . . . 

00:33:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Um, can we come back to that, that part about this time is different? 'Cause I think that's very important, what you just said. Okay. What I want to ask you, do you, do you want to be reconciled to them. Do you want to have a family again, where you're part of it? 

00:33:45
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:33:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I didn't hear that answer. 

00:33:50
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, absolutely. 

00:33:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay, so you want that to work out for the better for you . . . 

00:33:55
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:33:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . and for the family? 

00:33:55
ANDREW MAIER Well yeah. 

00:33:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Now what do they, as a, as a very tiny first step, what do they need to hear from you when they come to visit? 

00:34:05
ANDREW MAIER They sound funny and I'm just going to shut up and listen to them now. I don't know if that sounds kind of strange. I- . . . 

00:34:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:34:15
ANDREW MAIER . . . I've been running my mouth off at them, I mean just to be honest, I'm not going to lie, I mean . . . 

00:34:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:34:20
ANDREW MAIER . . .this is the first time that they're not listening, and I think I just need to shut up and just . . . 

00:34:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. So suppose they come and they say, 'Joe, what do you have to say to us?' What do they, what do you. . . 

00:34:30
ANDREW MAIER I would probably just tell them, I said enough to ya, you know, I'm just, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this. I'd just tell them I'm going to . . . 

00:34:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do what? 

00:34:35
ANDREW MAIER Treatment. I mean I, I . . . 

00:34:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING How long? 

00:34:40
ANDREW MAIER Well they said 90-days, but I-I heard from some people here sometimes it takes longer. I, I don't, you know, I don't really care how long, I mean it's like, last two times I thought I had all these important things to run off to, it's like, I don't have anything going on, it's like, you know. So it's kind of a nice place, I'll be here as long as I need to. 

00:35:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Can I give you a hint about what, how to talk to them? 

00:35:05
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:35:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING To add on to what you said, what you said was quite nice, but . . . 

00:35:10
ANDREW MAIER Absolutely. 

00:35:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . can I, can I . . . 

00:35:10
ANDREW MAIER If you think it will help. 

00:35:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . give you a hint? Yeah. Uh, suppose you're the, you're my dad . . . 

00:35:15
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:35:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . and I say, 'Dad, I'm here for the 90-days, but I'm gonna take one day at a time, and work on it.' 

00:35:30
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. Yeah, cause I would mean it if I said it, I mean, you know. 

00:35:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Could you talk to them like that? 

00:35:35
ANDREW MAIER Sure. I'll be here as long as it take, but I'll do it . . . 

00:35:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Suppose they said, 'Joe, are you going to go back to your drinking in the future or drugging or whatever?' What would you say. 

00:35:45
ANDREW MAIER I can only tell them what I think right now, and I just, no, I'm not going to, you know, no, I'm not going to do that anymore. 

00:35:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Ever? Are you going to? Joe? Are you saying you're never gonna do that? 

00:35:55
ANDREW MAIER I just don't think, I just don't think they're going to believe me. They're not going to believe me. 

00:35:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Are you saying, can you promise us you're never going to do that? Yeah. Okay, now I'm me again 

00:36:05
ANDREW MAIER Okay. 

00:36:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Can I make a suggestion? 

00:36:10
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:36:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, you're the father, I'm you. 

00:36:10
ANDREW MAIER Okay, I'm the father. 

00:36:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yes. 

00:36:15
ANDREW MAIER Okay. 

00:36:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Ask me that question. 

00:36:15
ANDREW MAIER Joe, can you promise me that you're not going to do this again? 

00:36:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I can promise you that I'm going to take one day at a time, my philosophy will be, just for today. 

00:36:30
ANDREW MAIER My dad, he'd be blown away. He'd be like, wow, is that my son? 

00:36:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. That's one thing to say it, it's another thing to . . . 

00:36:40
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:36:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Put it right here. 

00:36:40
ANDREW MAIER Right. I mean I don't know, I don't know what that even means. 

00:36:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No you don't. Not yet. It takes about, it takes about 40-days to learn it. If you take one day at a time. 

00:36:55
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, I could, I mean, I could be here. I mean, I'm here today. 

00:37:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:00
ANDREW MAIER I mean last time I was, I just kept thinking about how to get out and I'm not really thinking about how to get out today. 

00:37:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:05
ANDREW MAIER I'm kind of surprising myself a little bit, it's kind of weird. 

00:37:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:37:05
ANDREW MAIER I figured I would already be trying something, I mean, maybe it's because I know that my parents are done talking, it's like, last time I'd go to the payphone, I'd sneak out and call them, but they'd always take be back 

00:37:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:37:20
ANDREW MAIER You seem like you've been talking to . . . 

00:37:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So we have 

00:37:20
ANDREW MAIER . . . them though, you've been talking to them. 

00:37:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah. Now, um, what, what did, what, you sneak, you said you sneak out and go to the payphone, and all that kind of stuff. So what's your plan here? A plan that will help you? As far as the rules of this treatment programs goes? 

00:37:45
ANDREW MAIER Well there's, there's that guy David, he's my roommate. 

00:37:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:37:45
ANDREW MAIER And he's, he told me he's been here for about, like 30-days or so. 

00:37:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING He's been here 30-days, okay. 

00:37:50
ANDREW MAIER But he, I don't know how he's doing, you know, he says he's doing good and you know he's, he's sort of telling me, you know like what he's been doing, and it seems like he's, it seemed like he's doing alright. 

00:38:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:38:05
ANDREW MAIER He's talking in the groups and like I don't know if he's bullshitting, I don't know if he's, you know. 

00:38:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well you know, people come in and they do, sometimes people, I don't know about him, but I mean, part of the, part of the plan here, part of the recovery we call this is tha-, that people bull crap in the beginning, and then they gradually do less and less. 

00:38:25
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:38:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So it's okay if you want to bull crap at the beginning. 

00:38:30
ANDREW MAIER Okay. Alright, but just do less of it. 

00:38:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Maybe if you bull crap five times a day or ten times you could just lessen it. 

00:38:35
ANDREW MAIER Okay. 

00:38:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So like four or eight. 

00:38:40
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:38:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Have, let's say, how many times would you say you tried to bull crap me today? 

00:38:45
ANDREW MAIER I was just thinking, like twice. 

00:38:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Twice. Okay. 

00:38:45
ANDREW MAIER The food's actually not that bad. 

00:38:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Okay. 

00:38:50
ANDREW MAIER I just said it because you, I thought maybe I should say something bad. 

00:38:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. I did ask you that, I started out on the . . . 

00:38:55
ANDREW MAIER I know. 

00:38:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . on a very negative note. 

00:39:00
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:39:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean I encouraged you to be negative. 

00:39:05
ANDREW MAIER Well the counselors have just, they've been, they never been, I don't know. They're always sort of just tell me what to do, and just sort of talking. 

00:39:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:39:10
ANDREW MAIER They just sort of tell me that I need to go to meetings . . . 

00:39:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well I don't want to . . . 

00:39:15
ANDREW MAIER . . . I need a sponsor. 

00:39:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING What kind of meetings 

00:39:15
ANDREW MAIER Well they tell me I gotta go to AA meetings. 

00:39:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING AA, yeah. 

00:39:20
ANDREW MAIER It's kind of like, they just seem kind of crazy there though, they're just hugging each other and stuff . . . 

00:39:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know about that part but um, what do you think about this one day at a time while you're here? 

00:39:40
ANDREW MAIER You'll be my counselor, right? I mean . . . 

00:39:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well either me or somebody else. We'll have a lot of people talking to you.. But we all say pretty much the same thing. You're going to hear one day at a time until you're sick of it. 

00:40:00
ANDREW MAIER So they all say that. 

00:40:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah, you don't get a job here without saying it. 

00:40:05
ANDREW MAIER You're funny. I could, I could live with that. One day at a time. I mean it's, you know. I kind of like that idea actually, because I'm always worrying about, you know like next week . . . 

00:40:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:40:20
ANDREW MAIER And how am I going to do . . . 

00:40:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. So, today, what does that mean to you? One day, like you don't have a full day anymore, but you know the rest of the day at a time. 

00:40:30
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, the morning sucked a little bit. It was like getting roused out of bed, I figured they'd let me sleep . . . 

00:40:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:40:35
ANDREW MAIER . . . but I'm over it. 

00:40:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So, what, what, what does one day at a time mean the rest of today? 

00:40:40
ANDREW MAIER I guess we, you know, we got lunch coming up and then I could hang out with David and talk a little bit with him, and you know. Um, maybe fill out that assessment, you know, that package . . . 

00:40:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Questions we ask you. 

00:41:00
ANDREW MAIER I could do that I guess. After lunch. 

00:41:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:41:05
ANDREW MAIER And I could, and then I guess I could, David's talking about the meetings that he goes, I'll just go. I'm not going to hug anybody, or do any of that like. 

00:41:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No, it's too soon. Too soon. Suppose um, on those, on those questions, now how many would you bull crap on? And how many would you be straight? 

00:41:25
ANDREW MAIER Some of them are stupid stuff. You know, I'm going to bull crap on a couple of them, because they're . . . 

00:41:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, I think there's how many questions? There's like 40 or 50? 

00:41:30
ANDREW MAIER Um? 

00:41:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING How many would you bull crap? 

00:41:35
ANDREW MAIER Is five alright? 

00:41:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Five sounds good. And the rest you could be honest with? 

00:41:40
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, I could do that. 

00:41:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:41:45
ANDREW MAIER Sounds good. 

00:41:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:41:45
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. You're serious. 

00:41:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well suppose I said how about never bull crapping again, what would you say? 

00:41:55
ANDREW MAIER I'd say you're bull crap-. 

00:41:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You'd say I'm full of it. 

00:41:55
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. Yeah. You's a different kind of, I mean I've never had a counselor tell me it's alright to bull crap a little bit. They're always like, telling me it's character this, and you're a liar . . . 

00:42:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:42:10
ANDREW MAIER You know, calling me a liar. 

00:42:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You've got to be congruent. Have you heard that phrase in the programs? You've got to be congruent, which means you're outside behavior has to match your inside motivation. 

00:42:20
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:42:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well that's great, but that's down the road. 

00:42:25
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:42:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's the 91st day in the program. 

00:42:25
ANDREW MAIER Alright, so I got time. 

00:42:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You got time. 

00:42:30
ANDREW MAIER You're not going to rush me? Cool. 

00:42:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You know that old Irish saying? 'When God made time she made plenty of it.' 

00:42:45
ANDREW MAIER She. 

00:42:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I changed that a little bit. It wasn't quite that way. 

00:42:55
ANDREW MAIER I've never heard that before. 

00:42:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Now let me ask you, you're laughing, you're kind of joking and, before you came in here did you get a lot of laughs, you know, I don't mean laughs when you're high, but . . . 

00:43:00
ANDREW MAIER No, I don't think I've laughed and it feels good. I . . . 

00:43:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:43:05
ANDREW MAIER . . .haven't laughed in a long time. I mean it's. 

00:43:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So here you are, able to laugh, you're able to see some humor. 

00:43:10
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:43:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Without the need for drugs. 

00:43:10
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:43:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And so you've proven that you can do that. 

00:43:15
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I'm just kind of worried, I mean, you said I might have all these different counselors, I mean, I, are you sure they're kind of cool like this? I mean I don't know if . . . 

00:43:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, um, I can't speak for them, but we all seem to have the same general approach to people. 

00:43:35
ANDREW MAIER You talk, you talk to them . . . 

00:43:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah, we have staff meetings. 

00:43:40
ANDREW MAIER Okay. Um. So they're o-, I mean, eh. 

00:43:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Now I said I wanted to come back to something. Do you remember what it was? 

00:43:50
ANDREW MAIER No, I, my heads a little, I'm still a little. 

00:43:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Well I think it was the relationship with your family. 

00:44:00
ANDREW MAIER Oh. 

00:44:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And um, how you want that to be. 

00:44:05
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, it's pretty shitty right now. 

00:44:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. You want that to be better? 

00:44:10
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:44:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Can I, can I make an observation? Uh, and it's more of a question, um, wh-, I said what do they want to hear from you, and we kind of practiced that they might want to hear one day at a time, rather than a big time promise. 

00:44:30
ANDREW MAIER Right. Right. Right. 

00:44:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, uh, they might also want to hear what you did like today, whatever day that is that they come, what you did that day to show that you are trying to live one day at a time. What would you tell them? 

00:44:45
ANDREW MAIER Tell them I got up at the right time, and you know, made my bed, did the morning chore-, like I did the community job we have to do . . . 

00:44:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:44:55
ANDREW MAIER Pitched in around the, you know. 

00:44:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:44:55
ANDREW MAIER Made my own breakfast. I mean they . . . 

00:45:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING What about when you went to group? 

00:45:05
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, tell them I got to group on time, participated . . . 

00:45:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And what, and what does that mean participated. You said what? 

00:45:10
ANDREW MAIER It's like, just be honest. I wouldn't be bullshitting, you know. Whatever the groups about, you know . . . 

00:45:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:45:15
ANDREW MAIER I don't know yet. I just started seeing a couple of groups. But it seems like people in there are talking about sort of what they've been through, what they need to do to . . . 

00:45:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

00:45:30
ANDREW MAIER So I think I'll talk about what I need to do. You know I need to, I need to get a job back. I, you know. . . 

00:45:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean, the to-, the one day at a time. That's down the road. 

00:45:40
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know . . . 

00:45:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It sounds pretty good what you've said. 

00:45:45
ANDREW MAIER Participate in group, you know I come see you, and you know. Here some more funny sayings, I mean I, you know, I mean, um, it's not so bad. 

00:45:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, so that's the kind of thing they want to hear? 

00:46:05
[sil.] 

00:46:10
ANDREW MAIER I don't know. I don't know what, you know it's. 

00:46:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That, you know, I'm just asking you. 

00:46:15
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Did you think that's what, now is that different from what they would have heard in the past? 

00:46:25
ANDREW MAIER Uh, 'cause they'd still be like, well it's all about you, I mean, yeah, maybe I need to write them a letter or something. I don't know. It's got to be something I could sort of, maybe if I'm talking about in groups like what I could do to be a better son, or brother, or you know like . . . 

00:46:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Can I make a suggestion? 

00:46:45
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:46:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Kind of hold that off for a while. 

00:46:50
ANDREW MAIER Okay. 

00:46:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Are you willing to do that? 

00:46:55
ANDREW MAIER Yes, I don't understand, 

00:47:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, maybe you could think about it and write it down, but as far as telling them . . . 

00:47:05
ANDREW MAIER Okay. I can do that. 

00:47:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I'm just trying to say are they going to say, 'Yeah well we've heard this crap before.' You see, that's what I'm afraid they're going to say, would you want them to hear, or say something different to you? 

00:47:20
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I'm just kind of scared to see them now that we're talking about this. It's kind of like, you know. 

00:47:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You're scared to see them? 

00:47:25
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:47:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, that's good. 

00:47:30
ANDREW MAIER Really? 

00:47:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, yeah. Confidence at this stage is dangerous. 

00:47:35
ANDREW MAIER I never thought about it like that. 

00:47:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah. 

00:47:40
ANDREW MAIER Well, I'm just scared, you see, because I'm not, I mean they're not gonna believe any of it. 

00:47:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No. 

00:47:45
ANDREW MAIER They, you know it's like I can't, I've never, it's like I can't fake them out, I mean its just their . . . 

00:47:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No. And you'll be able to fake them out less and less if they come to our program. Yeah. They'll see right through any games. And we teach them to do that. 

00:48:05
ANDREW MAIER I mean, I guess it's good, because I want this, but it's also kind of a little scary because it's like, well . . . 

00:48:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:48:15
ANDREW MAIER . . . then what? You know. 

00:48:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why it's a 90-day program. 

00:48:20
ANDREW MAIER So it's good to be scared. 

00:48:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, yeah. 

00:48:25
ANDREW MAIER Well that's good . . . 

00:48:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:48:25
ANDREW MAIER I'm scared, I'm scared shitless. To be honest with you. 

00:48:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's a good sign. You're right, you're on the right path. 

00:48:35
ANDREW MAIER Oh, okay. I mean I've been trying to act like it's . . . 

00:48:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. I mean you're kind of even with me, I think you're acting like you're kind of cool. 

00:48:45
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:48:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Which is okay. 

00:48:45
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:48:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING But I see through it. 

00:48:45
ANDREW MAIER That's good, that's . . . So it's alright, I mean I've been sort of, you know, 'cause if I don't do, if I don't do it this time, I mean it's, you know . . . 

00:49:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:49:00
ANDREW MAIER I've never, I've never, I never seen them this serious. I don't have anywhere to go. 

00:49:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah, they're very serious. 

00:49:05
ANDREW MAIER So, so what do I do about being scared. I mean I don't, it's kind of . . . 

00:49:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well have you ever been scared before? 

00:49:15
ANDREW MAIER I guess so, not about this. 

00:49:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but about anything? 

00:49:20
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:49:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Did you, did you fight it? Did you fight it? 

00:49:25
ANDREW MAIER When I was a little kid I was scared of the dark. 

00:49:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but I mean in your drug career. 

00:49:30
ANDREW MAIER Oh, that. Well not really, I mean stuff never really scared me, I mean . . . 

00:49:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Haven't you been afraid of getting mugged or being homeless, or uh . . . 

00:49:40
ANDREW MAIER The homeless I guess. 'Cause I always knew I could go back home, so it was never . . . 

00:49:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:49:45
ANDREW MAIER You know, I knew you know . . . 

00:49:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Afraid of getting arrested? Anything like feel a little twinge of a fear? 

00:49:50
ANDREW MAIER No, cause I guess it's, because when it happened I was so jacked up . . . 

00:49:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. 

00:49:55
ANDREW MAIER . . . I never really so then after that it was like, 'whatever.' 

00:50:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So this is a new experience. 

00:50:00
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. 

00:50:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh man, in only two days. 

00:50:05
ANDREW MAIER I don't know what's coming around the corner with, with . . . 

00:50:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:50:10
ANDREW MAIER I mean I don't, you know this one day at a time is kind of hard, but I don't know. 

00:50:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah, so really in a very short amount of time her you have learned to make a change. 

00:50:20
ANDREW MAIER I guess. 

00:50:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING To be afraid. 

00:50:25
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:50:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING To kind of change what you want to how you want to talk to your parents? 

00:50:30
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:50:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You, you've already changed what you think they will say to you. 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:45
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. I know they're gonna believe you. I'm believing you, I mean, they're gonna believe you. I mean I was going to show you, I'll show you and maybe you could talk to them and just kind of tell them . . . 

00:50:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, I'll, I'll be your advocate, but not right away. 

00:51:05
ANDREW MAIER What do you mean? Are you going to leave me hanging? 

00:51:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well I'll see how you do for a couple of weeks. 

00:51:15
ANDREW MAIER That's fair enough. 

00:51:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING If you, if you come here and you keep bull slinging. Let's say you bull sling on half the questions, and then they come . . . 

00:51:25
ANDREW MAIER Well but I'm just, you know . . . 

00:51:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . then they come, I mean we'll, we'll, it would be very different. 

00:51:30
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, but . . . 

00:51:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING But if you can only bull crap for five of them, that's a huge step. An enormous . . . 

00:51:35
ANDREW MAIER See, they don't want me bull, they, I mean would you tell them that it was five? Or would you just tell them that . . . 

00:51:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, we don't need to tell them anything about that. 

00:51:40
ANDREW MAIER Is that, I mean, are they, they. Hm. I'm just going to need help, I don't know what to do. 

00:51:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Um, wow. You just said something very important there. Mm. Mm. 

00:52:05
ANDREW MAIER What'd I say? 

00:52:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You just said, 'I need help.' 

00:52:10
ANDREW MAIER I do. I mean I . . . 

00:52:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Is that, is that a new thought on that part or have you always said that? 

00:52:15
ANDREW MAIER No, I mean, I don't think I ever, I mean I told my parents this last time . . . 

00:52:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:52:20
ANDREW MAIER . . . when they didn't, I mean that's when they didn't hang up and then they told me I got to come here. 

00:52:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:52:25
ANDREW MAIER So I mean that, so I said, and I meant it, I said I need help, and they said, well, you need to go talk with Bob, you need to go . . . 

00:52:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So they did, they did accept that. 

00:52:35
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I guess so, because they told me to come here. 

00:52:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, and you came. 'Cause you admitted it. 

00:52:45
ANDREW MAIER I came right then. I mean I walked . . . 

00:52:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So the idea of overall, the idea of admitting to yourself that I need help, that's kind of a new experience. I mean, I'm just trying to understand. 

00:52:55
ANDREW MAIER Well, yeah, I guess . . . 

00:52:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I sthat what you're saying, or am I wrong. 

00:52:55
ANDREW MAIER No, no, I guess so. 

00:53:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:53:00
ANDREW MAIER I mean sometimes I sort of said I need help with this to get some money or . . . 

00:53:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. 

00:53:05
ANDREW MAIER I mean for, or whatever I might need. But like . . . 

00:53:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING The way I took it, Joe is when you said I need help, I took it to mean, I need help dealing with this drug career that I've had. 

00:53:15
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:53:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Is that accurate or am I wrong? 

00:53:20
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. I, yeah, that's accurate. I mean that, that, I need, I mean I've been through, I, I, I could, I know all the lingo, I could, I mean I could . . . 

00:53:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:53:30
ANDREW MAIER I could, but I, you know, this time I really want to do it. I-, I don't know how to really do it. I mean I, now I know I can't bullshit my way through here. 

00:53:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That we've heard all before. 

00:53:45
ANDREW MAIER I mean. 

00:53:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean we accept it, but you know, we've heard it. 

00:53:55
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah I just want this to be different, so I . . . 

00:54:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, well I get a genuineness in what you're saying. I mean that's my impression. Plus you said you made some changes already, you said you pre-, you're afraid, you want help, that's something you've been saying for a while, you want to hear something from your parents, and you want to tell them something that they will accept that's genuine. 

00:54:25
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:54:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And these are the things you've said. I'm only trying to understand and reflect what you've said. 

00:54:30
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. It's just you know, something sticks in my head, the last place I was at, they keep, they just tell everyone, every-, everybody, everybody fails at this, they, they, they showed us all these statistics one out of ten and it's like, you know, so I'm thinking in the back of my mind well even if I want help and I'm going to do, well what's the point. Oh it just doesn't work? 

00:54:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well we have a better record than one out of ten. 

00:54:50
ANDREW MAIER What's your record? 

00:54:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Two out of ten. I'm just kidding you. Just kidding you, we're better than that. I don't know what our record is, but it's, it's pretty good. 

00:54:55
ANDREW MAIER But why do they do that? I mean, it's like they, you know, I mean, what are they, it's like. I mean I've been thinking for a number of years like, 'Ah, you can't really change this it's.' You just have to, but you can. 

00:55:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You can. Now do you believe you can? 

00:55:25
ANDREW MAIER Well if I'm here I think. 

00:55:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. I think you believe it or you wouldn't be here. 

00:55:30
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, I guess. 

00:55:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You know the first thing, can I get, can I give you some detail about that? 

00:55:35
ANDREW MAIER Mm-hm. 

00:55:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING First thing is to say, 'I'm afraid.' Second thing is to say, 'This is what I want to hear from my parents, and this is how I'm going to talk to them. A little differently than I did.' And to say, 'One day at a time.' Even if it's only up here, it takes a little while for it to seep down into your gut. 

00:55:55
ANDREW MAIER Mm. Yeah, that's 'cause it's just in here. 

00:55:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's only here now, but that's a good place for it. 

00:56:00
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I'm just going to listen to you. I mean if you say one day at a time, I mean it's . . . 

00:56:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, that's what I say, but I'm hoping you say that. 

00:56:20
ANDREW MAIER Hm. 

00:56:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING This afternoon you have group. What are you going to do when you walk in there? 

00:56:20
ANDREW MAIER Can I tell them about what we talked about. 

00:56:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You can tell them. 

00:56:25
ANDREW MAIER Is that alright, I mean . . . 

00:56:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure. Sure. 

00:56:30
ANDREW MAIER I mean I'll just probably talk about this. 

00:56:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:56:30
ANDREW MAIER That, I mean I'm not going to admit I'm, I'm not going to tell them I'm scared, you know, it's. . . 

00:56:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, you can do it or you cannot tell them. Whatever you want to do. 

00:56:45
ANDREW MAIER It's kind of a big group to tell them. 

00:56:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. 

00:56:50
ANDREW MAIER Can't I just talk to you instead of the group, is that it? 

00:56:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No, part of the recovery program is to talk to the group. You don't have to hug them. 

00:57:00
ANDREW MAIER I'm not going to hug them. 

00:57:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's a plus isn't it? 

00:57:00
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. 

00:57:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:57:05
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I could just sit down and be cool. 

00:57:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:57:05
ANDREW MAIER I can tell them Bob said it's alright, I mean. 

00:57:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Why don't you just say you don't want to? 

00:57:15
ANDREW MAIER Yeah, I don't know. Then they'll sort of think I'm funny, I mean. 

00:57:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, it's up to you. 

00:57:20
ANDREW MAIER Alright. Alright. I'm, am I going to see you tomorrow?

00:57:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well your hands perspire. 

00:57:40
ANDREW MAIER . . .you know. 'Cause my hands were all sweaty and . . . 

00:57:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's one thing people tell me they say when they talk to me they, they kind of sweat. 

00:57:45
ANDREW MAIER You kind of, sc, I mean you, you were sort of scary a little . . .. 

00:57:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:57:50
ANDREW MAIER You're not scary, I mean, but, you know. 

00:57:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:57:50
ANDREW MAIER I've never . . . 

00:57:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's interesting, I didn't yell at you, put you down . . . 

00:57:55
ANDREW MAIER No. 

00:57:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . but yet your kind of nervous about it 

00:57:55
ANDREW MAIER Well 'cause I just . . . 

00:57:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's interesting isn't it? 

00:57:55
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I didn't know I, I can't bullshit you . . . 

00:58:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No. No. Maybe you could tell the group that. Man, he didn't yell at me, but I'm still sweating. 

00:58:05
ANDREW MAIER Yeah. I'll tell them that. 

00:58:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I bet they have something to say about that.

ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh he was doing drugs, and then he got into stealing. 

01:01:45
MARY GRAHAM Mm. 

01:01:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You know. And then the police came and pulled him over and he told the cop to go preform an impossible, unnatural act. 

01:02:00
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, cops are, yeah . . . 

01:02:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING They don't like that. 

01:02:00
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, they deserve it though. 

01:02:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, but the cop didn't go to prison. 

01:02:05
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. 

01:02:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well. 

01:02:10
MARY GRAHAM Just another person out to get. Me and my friends. 

01:02:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah, and the trouble is actually, once you do things, and they catch you, they keep an eye on you. 

01:02:20
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:02:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Have you noticed that? 

01:02:25
MARY GRAHAM I guess, like probation and stuff, or . . . 

01:02:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah, and even after you get off probation. You got a probation officer? 

01:02:35
MARY GRAHAM Maybe. 

01:02:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Is it a he or a she? 

01:02:35
MARY GRAHAM It's a he. 

01:02:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's a he. What's he like? 

01:02:45
MARY GRAHAM I mean. 

01:02:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING What does he tell you to do? 

01:02:45
MARY GRAHAM Oh, I got to take a UA every week, just because I got caught for doing a little bit of drugs, a little bit of alcohol. 

01:02:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, that's all it takes. 

01:02:55
MARY GRAHAM I have to come in and, and take a UA every week, and I ew, he lectures like, 'Julie, when are you eh.' Constantly in school, God. He it, he's a pain. 

01:03:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:03:05
MARY GRAHAM I hate him. 

01:03:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do you? 

01:03:05
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. 

01:03:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, I hope you never have an adult probation officer. They're worse. 

01:03:10
MARY GRAHAM I just won't get caught next time. 

01:03:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm. How many times have you been caught so far? 

01:03:20
MARY GRAHAM Just a couple. 

01:03:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING How many is a couple? 

01:03:25
MARY GRAHAM Like four. 

01:03:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Four, wow. Four and you're 15. 

01:03:30
MARY GRAHAM I mean I can't smoke a little pot? 

01:03:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Let, let me ask you this. Suppose you smoke pot once a week. 

01:03:35
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:03:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And a lot of people do it more than that, but let's just say you do it once a week, and you do it 50-times a year. You take two weeks off for vacation. So you do 50-times a year, right? 

01:03:50
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:03:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Suppose one out of 25 times you get caught. Right? That's twice a year. Suppose you do this for five years. That's how many times? 

01:04:10
MARY GRAHAM A lot. 

01:04:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Two times five is ten. 

01:04:20
MARY GRAHAM It's just stupid they blow it up. . . 

01:04:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's a lot of time spent in front of the judge. 

01:04:25
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, but it's blown up, way out of proportion. Have you ever smoked put? 

01:04:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Na. I don't even drink coffee. 

01:04:30
MARY GRAHAM Whatever, I mean . . . 

01:04:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Caffeine makes . . . 

01:04:30
MARY GRAHAM . . . it doesn't even hurt you. 

01:04:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . caffeine makes me crazy. 

01:04:35
MARY GRAHAM Maybe I should try some caffeine. 

01:04:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well you don't get arrested for that kind of craziness. I don't even smoke cigarettes. You're wondering how I can help you, right? 

01:04:55
MARY GRAHAM No I'm wondering how I can get out of here, actually. 

01:05:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Out of where? 

01:05:00
MARY GRAHAM Here. 

01:05:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Where, what's so bad about this? We're just having a little conversation. 

01:05:05
MARY GRAHAM I know, but here's what's going to happen. You'd going to sit there in just a second and you're going to start lecturing me, you're going to tell me like, 'Julie, you got to get your grades up, you got to stop smoking pot, you got to eh, you got to go back to class, you got to do work.' Same, same crap everybody tells me. 

01:05:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, so you know that huh? 

01:05:25
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:05:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So why don't we just pretend I did it? And then I don't have to do it. Is that okay? 

01:05:35
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. 

01:05:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Lecture's over. 

01:05:35
MARY GRAHAM Good I like that. 

01:05:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. So you heard the lecture for, how many times would you have heard it? 

01:05:40
MARY GRAHAM Well I, everybody, every school I go to . . . 

01:05:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:05:45
MARY GRAHAM I get drug into the guidance counselor, every thing, every same thing. 

01:05:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I'll just take a guess how many times would you have rec-, how, you know, had that lecture? 

01:05:55
MARY GRAHAM Like maybe 50-times. 

01:05:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING 50-times. 

01:05:55
MARY GRAHAM I swear. 

01:05:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Is that all? 

01:05:55
MARY GRAHAM That's a lot. 

01:06:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I was, maybe I should give it to you again. 

01:06:00
MARY GRAHAM No. Please, don't. 

01:06:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, I won't do it. I'm just kidding. 

01:06:05
MARY GRAHAM Okay, good. 

01:06:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So 51-times would not make any difference? You agree with that? 

01:06:10
MARY GRAHAM Totally. 

01:06:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So we agree. Mm. When was the last time you ever agreed with an adult? Lately? 

01:06:20
MARY GRAHAM Uh, I don't really talk to adults if I don't have to. 

01:06:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you don't agree with them very often either. So here we are agreeing. So this seems like not such a bad place to talk. 

01:06:30
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:06:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING What do you think? No lectures. 

01:06:35
MARY GRAHAM As long as you don't lecture me, I am cool. If you just like stay off my back, and talk to me . . . 

01:06:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good to me. Now will you promise not to lecture me too. 

01:06:50
MARY GRAHAM It wouldn't matter what I say. 

01:06:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well it matters to me, that's why I'm asking you not to lecture me. 

01:07:00
MARY GRAHAM As if you'd listen to anything I have to say. 

01:07:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No, well you never know unless you lecture me. 

01:07:05
MARY GRAHAM Do you want me to lecture you? 

01:07:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, you know, come to think of it at first I thought no, but maybe it'd be alright. What would you lecture me about if you were to lecture me? 

01:07:15
MARY GRAHAM I would tell you, you know, you have to be nicer to kids in this school. And you shouldn't treat people differently, because of who their family is. 

01:07:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

01:07:25
MARY GRAHAM And I would also tell you to try to deal with some of these teachers that are trying to like get rid of kids like me. I'd tell you that you got to deal with the principal, because they're part of the problem. I'd tell you to give me a break. That's what I'd tell you. 

01:07:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Suppose I said I want to do all those things? What would you say? 

01:07:40
MARY GRAHAM I'd say good, it's about time. 

01:07:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Suppose I said thank you for the lecture. I think those are good ideas. 

01:07:50
MARY GRAHAM Really, you think those are good ideas? 

01:07:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. I do. And which of those do you think I should start on? 

01:08:00
MARY GRAHAM I think you should start on telling the teachers to stop treating kids like me like crap. 

01:08:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING How about just treating you, not the kids like you, but just you? 

01:08:15
MARY GRAHAM Well that would be a start? 

01:08:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Is that better? 

01:08:15
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. I'd like that. That would be good 

01:08:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . So I should stop, I mean they should stop treating kids like you like crap? 

01:08:20
MARY GRAHAM Yes. 

01:08:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Alright, would you want me to, now keep lecturing me. Is there any, is there any single teacher that you'd like me to focus on? 

01:08:30
MARY GRAHAM No, they all, every single teacher I have. 

01:08:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well of all these miserable teachers, who's the miserablist. 

01:08:40
MARY GRAHAM Ms. Bannan is the worst. 

01:08:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Alright, Ms. Bannan. 

01:08:45
MARY GRAHAM Yes. 

01:08:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Now give me some more lecture about what you want me to tell her. 

01:08:50
MARY GRAHAM You tell Ms. Bannan that first of all she shouldn't disrespect me. She shouldn't talk to me like I'm nothing in front of the other students. She shouldn't yell at me. 

01:09:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Wait a minute, wait a minute, should I point my finger at her like that? 

01:09:05
MARY GRAHAM Yes, do. 

01:09:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Point my finger at her like that. 

01:09:05
MARY GRAHAM She does it to me. She says 'Julie, shut up, sit down. You're no good. You're not going to amount to anything.' She said that in front of the class. 

01:09:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do you listen to her? 

01:09:20
MARY GRAHAM No. 

01:09:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, but you think if I do this same thing, that she will listen to me? 

01:09:25
MARY GRAHAM Yes, because you have power. You're somebody in the school, I'm nobody. 

01:09:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's a good point. I think maybe you've got something there. Okay, uh, so I should tell her that. 

01:09:40
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:09:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Now, well I'm, I'm listening to your lecture. Hm. What do you think about my attitude toward your lecture? 

01:09:55
MARY GRAHAM Well I can't believe you're actually taking it serious, like nobody's ever said they'd say anything. 

01:10:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well to be honest with you I didn't hear a bad idea in your lecture at all. They're all good ideas. 

01:10:10
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. Like you're the first person that's ever even thought about sticking up for me. 

01:10:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well I appreciate that. Now how is the way I heard your lecture with an open mind, not this is a, this is a kind of a question that's hard, I don't know if I should ask it. I don't know if you're ready for it. I just cant decide whether I should ask you. 

01:10:50
MARY GRAHAM Oh yeah, go on, you can ask. 

01:10:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You think I can ask it? 

01:10:55
MARY GRAHAM No I think you can. 

01:10:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Alright. How is the way I took your lecture different fromm the way you take these fifty lectures that you've heard? 

01:11:10
MARY GRAHAM Because what I'm saying to you is true. What people are saying to me are lies. And it's mean. What I said to you is true. And so the way, but when people talk to me that way, it's disrespectful, and they're lies. But what I said to you was the truth. 

01:11:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING They're lies? 

01:11:35
MARY GRAHAM I'm going somewhere. Like that lady can't tell me I'm not going anywhere in my life. That is a lie. 

01:11:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Hm. What would be some other lies? 

01:11:45
MARY GRAHAM Well I do talk, but she shouldn't say shut up. 

01:11:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh. 

01:11:55
MARY GRAHAM So that's not a lie, but it's rude. 

01:11:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's just what she does that you don't like. 

01:12:00
MARY GRAHAM She shouldn't say . . . 

01:12:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING But what she says is true? Is that right? 

01:12:05
MARY GRAHAM Accept that I'm not, I'm going somewhere. 

01:12:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah that part, yeah, I understand that part, but the part that when she says you talk a lot, you just don't like the way she tells you. I mean, I'm just trying to understand. 

01:12:15
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, like I do talk, I do talk a lot. Because her class is boring, and she . . . 

01:12:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:12:20
MARY GRAHAM hates me and she's stupid. 

01:12:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Okay. What other parts of these lectures are lies? These 50-lectures? 

01:12:30
MARY GRAHAM Well I don't do any homework, so that . . . 

01:12:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So that part would be true. 

01:12:35
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, but there's a reason for that. 

01:12:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Now, okay what other, was, are, is there any other lie? I mean you just named two lies. So they usually come in threes. What would the third one be? 

01:12:50
MARY GRAHAM Well I do smoke a little pot. 

01:12:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh. So that's not a lie. 

01:12:50
MARY GRAHAM But, the way they put, you know like all these adults, it's like my gosh, you know, pot is way better than drinking. 

01:13:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

01:13:00
MARY GRAHAM Like you don't see anybody, drink-, smoking pot and killing people on the roads. It's no big deal. 

01:13:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Okay. But that is true what they tell you? 

01:13:10
MARY GRAHAM But it's overreaction the way they talk . . . 

01:13:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Sure. 

01:13:10
MARY GRAHAM . . . to me about it. 

01:13:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Sure. Hm. So you would like them to tell you, let me ask you this, you want them to tell you the truth? Or do you want them to lie to you? 

01:13:30
MARY GRAHAM Well I don't want them to lie to me. 

01:13:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, so you don't want them to lie to you. But when you, when they tell you the truth, would you like them to tell you in a more courteous way? Like you said, respect? 

01:13:45
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. If they have something to say to me, just say it like respectful. 

01:13:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Alright, so, I'm just trying to, if I'm going to go to Ms. Bannan I need to understand what your thinking is. 

01:13:55
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, I don't care if she talks to me like I'm a human being. 

01:14:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:14:00
MARY GRAHAM You know, like, but when she talks to me like I'm nothing I'm not taking that. 

01:14:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, nobody likes that sort of thing, and you don't like it. Now, you want me to say something to her? 

01:14:15
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. 

01:14:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. I mean it's hard to go to all the teachers, but I'd like to start with one of them and see how it goes. 

01:14:20
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. She's the one to start with. 

01:14:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:14:20
MARY GRAHAM And you give it to her good. 

01:14:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Well I don't want to give her something that will upset her. You think that would help if she got mad at me? Then she's mad at two people. 

01:14:35
MARY GRAHAM No I guess not. 

01:14:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Mm-hm. 

01:14:35
MARY GRAHAM But she does kind of deserve it. 

01:14:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING See what, well I don't want to argue that point. But the point is, will you want me to kind of win her over? 

01:14:45
MARY GRAHAM If you can get her to talk to me nice, and not treat me like crap, then you can do whatever you need to do. 

01:14:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well here's my point. Before she'll talk to you like you're somebody instead of like crap, she has to trust me. So do you have any idea, you know her better than I do because you're sitting in there everyday, do you have any idea, any suggestion about what I would say to her that would win her over to me? So that she would listen? 

01:15:20
[sil.] 

01:15:25
MARY GRAHAM You could say, 'Why do you talk to Julie like she's nothing?' Why . . . 

01:15:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well let's put it this way, what does she really, what would I say to her that would aggravate her? 

01:15:35
MARY GRAHAM Tell her she's a crappy, she's a bad teacher. And she's boring, and that she doesn't care about her students. 

01:15:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, so that would make things worse. 

01:15:45
MARY GRAHAM No, we-, yeah, I guess. 

01:15:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. So if I said you're a lousy teacher, Julie's right, you're boring, and I'm not going to pay attention to you. That would make things worse. 

01:16:00
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I didn't think about it that way. 

01:16:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I think that does make things worse. So that would be out of the question for me to tell her that. 

01:16:15
MARY GRAHAM Well I don't want it to get any worse. Like I can't . . . 

01:16:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah, so I should. Can I really be blunt with you? I mean you don't strike me as a weak person, I think you can take some bluntness. Am I right about that? 

01:16:25
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. Yeah. 

01:16:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Not disrespectful, just bluntness. 

01:16:30
MARY GRAHAM As long as you tell, don't talk to me like I should be talked to. 

01:16:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, we're talking right now . . . 

01:16:35
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. Yeah. 

01:16:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . aren't we? Are you okay with this? 

01:16:35
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. 

01:16:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, so let me, now this is going to be kind of this is another heavy duty question. You ready for it? 

01:16:50
[sil.] 

01:16:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I'm thinking, should I or shouldn't I ask it. 

01:16:55
MARY GRAHAM You can ask it. 

01:16:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well I think I can, okay good. Now, in other words, are you telling me Julie that I should not talk to her the way you talk to her? 

01:17:10
[sil.] 

01:17:15
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, but I have a good reason to talk to her that way. 

01:17:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh I know. I was . . . 

01:17:15
MARY GRAHAM I do. 

01:17:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . I'd have a very good reason to talk to her, I'd it would be to get her off your back. 

01:17:20
MARY GRAHAM But I, you, yeah. 

01:17:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, so is the answer yes? 

01:17:25
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. I guess. 

01:17:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yes, I should not talk to her that way? 

01:17:30
MARY GRAHAM I guess not. 

01:17:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. So what I'll try to do is I will approach her and I'll try to figure something out. I don;t know just what, but it won't make things worse. 

01:17:40
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, I just don't want to make it worse. 

01:17:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So I need to talk to her in a different way than she's use to, huh? Would that be okay? 

01:17:55
MARY GRAHAM Yeah. 

01:18:00
[sil.] 

01:18:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Crazy idea just occurred to me. Would you be willing to do the same for one day? 

01:18:15
MARY GRAHAM Talk to her? 

01:18:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Talk to her differently? I mean I'm gonna do it. 

01:18:25
MARY GRAHAM I know you know what I'm saying is true, because I know you know her, because you work here. 

01:18:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:18:30
MARY GRAHAM So that is going to be hard. 

01:18:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You see it's not good for me to, it's not good for me to badmouth teachers. I don't do that. And notice I haven't done that. Yet you can do it all you want. And I accept it, as I, as I think I've shown you. Right? Am I right about that? 

01:18:45
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:18:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Not I'm just saying, would you be willing to do what I'l going to do, and then you asked me to do it, we talked about what would make it worse, we talked about what would make it better, and that so far I've got all the work to do. And I feel kind of bad about that. 

01:19:00
MARY GRAHAM So like what would I say? 

01:19:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, when you're, when you, when you do something that aggravates her, what do you do when you walk into the classroom? 

01:19:15
MARY GRAHAM Well the first think I do is I look at her. 

01:19:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:19:20
MARY GRAHAM And I look at her like, you know how. 

01:19:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, I know, I know how. 

01:19:25
MARY GRAHAM And then . . . 

01:19:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING So could you look at her differently? 

01:19:30
MARY GRAHAM I just get so mad when I see her. 

01:19:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. 

01:19:35
MARY GRAHAM Maybe I could just not look at her. Like just not make eye contact with her. 

01:19:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's possible. 

01:19:40
MARY GRAHAM Because I feel like she looks at me the same way. 

01:19:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Can I make a suggestion? Suppose, just suppose you walk in and you look at her and you say good morning, and you smile. Just like you just did, see you smiled just now. 

01:19:55
MARY GRAHAM Oh my gosh. I would never do that. Jeese. 

01:20:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Up until now you haven't. Let me put it this way, would it help or would it hurt? 

01:20:05
MARY GRAHAM She'd probably think I was smoking pot if I walked in there and like said good morning to her and smiled. 

01:20:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING She might. She might. 

01:20:15
MARY GRAHAM I've never been ever done that to a teacher. 

01:20:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING She might. 

01:20:15
MARY GRAHAM Ever. 

01:20:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well you're here, you're upset because of what's going on around here, and you want me to do something which I'm very willing to do, and I'm just saying what do you think about doing the same thing that I'm going to do? 

01:20:30
MARY GRAHAM So go in there and like say, 'Good morning Ms. Bannan." 

01:20:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, if you say it with that expression on your face is that going to get you any closer to her? Or is it going to improve things? What do you think? 

01:20:45
MARY GRAHAM So like,'Good morning Ms. Bannon.' Is that okay? 

01:20:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's better. That's better. Could you give it a third try? 

01:20:55
MARY GRAHAM Good morning Ms. Bannan. 

01:20:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, that's pretty much the same. 

01:21:00
MARY GRAHAM It's really hard when I think of her. 

01:21:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah, but you don't strike me as weak. You know there's people that I talk to, I, I, take me weeks to even get to this kind of a suggestion. 

01:21:10
MARY GRAHAM Just to say good morning? 

01:21:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. I have some tough customers in this school. 

01:21:15
MARY GRAHAM That's stupid, because it's no big deal. 

01:21:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, it seems like a big deal to me. 

01:21:20
MARY GRAHAM Okay, so, 'Good morning Ms. Bannan.' 

01:21:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, how did that feel to you? 

01:21:30
MARY GRAHAM It wasn't as, eh. 

01:21:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It's kind of pretending isn't it? Yeah, that's good. Do you ever go to movies or watch TV, it's all pretending. 

01:21:45
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. I play a lot of DS, Nintendo DS too. 

01:21:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh man. 

01:21:50
MARY GRAHAM Did you, do you have a DS? 

01:21:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No. 

01:21:50
MARY GRAHAM Oh it's fun. 

01:21:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well maybe you can show me about it sometime. 

01:21:55
MARY GRAHAM Oh yeah. Can I bring it to school? 

01:22:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING If it's within the rules. But I don't think it is. 

01:22:05
MARY GRAHAM Stupid rule. 

01:22:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Now so you're going to walk in, you're going to smile and be pleasant and say, 'Good morning Ms. Bannan.' 

01:22:15
MARY GRAHAM I might not be able to smile, but I can say, 'Good morning Ms. Bannan.' 

01:22:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:22:15
MARY GRAHAM I can say, 'Good morning Ms. Bannan.' 

01:22:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, when you say it, could you say, instead of good morning, say 'Good morning Ms. Bannan,' with the emphasis on the morning, 'Good morning Ms. Bannan.' Your voice kind of goes up. What do you think? 

01:22:30
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, I could, I could do that. 

01:22:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Let's hear you, let's hear you try. 

01:22:35
MARY GRAHAM Good mo-, eh, good morning Ms. Bannon. 

01:22:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh yeah. 

01:22:40
MARY GRAHAM I sound so totally fake . . . 

01:22:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:22:40
MARY GRAHAM . . . when I say that. 

01:22:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It will be fake for a while. 

01:22:45
MARY GRAHAM Oh. 

01:22:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It usually takes about five days before it's not fake. 

01:22:55
MARY GRAHAM So like what if she says, like something rude? 

01:22:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, she might, we, can you control what she does? 

01:23:00
MARY GRAHAM No. She's crazy. 

01:23:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No you can't control what anybody else does. We practiced good morning and you see how hard that was. 

01:23:10
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:23:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay, so you're gonna, will you agree to do that? 

01:23:15
MARY GRAHAM Yeah I can, I can do it. 

01:23:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Alright, so, now is there a second thing you can do? Once you're in the classroom? Because remember, I'm going to do the same thing. 

01:23:25
MARY GRAHAM I guess I can go to my desk and sit down instead of, 'cause like usually I come in, I like look at her, and then I go to see my friends, and she says, 'Julie, go over there, shut up, sit down . . .' 

01:23:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:23:40
MARY GRAHAM . . . and I look at her again, and . . . 

01:23:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Can I make a general suggestion? Do you want to really get to her? 

01:23:50
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. Yeah. 

01:23:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Make it hard for her to find something to criticize. 

01:23:55
MARY GRAHAM Like what do you mean? 

01:23:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well she's she's the, you, and I'm just going on what you said, she's looking for ways to jump on you, right? If you want to get to her, make it hard for her to find something. 

01:24:10
MARY GRAHAM Will that bother her do you think? 

01:24:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well it will at first, she'll be very confused. 

01:24:15
MARY GRAHAM I like that. Yeah. If it bothers her, so you're saying if I just do what I, like sit down, and like say good morning, that will get to her? 

01:24:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, she'll think, 'What is going on here?' Now if I go to her too and I say I'm work-, I'm working with Jul-, Julie, I'm trying to talk to Julie, and you know I kind of do that, and uh, so I'm working from this angle you're working from this angle. Who knows you're life might be a little happier. 

01:24:50
MARY GRAHAM Who knows? 

01:24:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do you want it to be happier? 

01:25:00
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, I guess. 

01:25:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I mean it must be miserable for you here. 

01:25:05
MARY GRAHAM Well it's not fun. 

01:25:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Right. 

01:25:05
MARY GRAHAM It's stupid here. 

01:25:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. So she's a special challenge. 

01:25:10
MARY GRAHAM She's special all right. 

01:25:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Now, so those would be two things. Now, what would be a third thing, 'cause you know, things go in threes. So what would be a third thing you could do in Ms. Bannan's class? 

01:25:30
MARY GRAHAM Well she's actua-, I'm ne-, I don't really turn in my homework. It's, 'cause it's stupid. 

01:25:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And you want to work on . . . 

01:25:35
MARY GRAHAM I mean reading and writing. 

01:25:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . you want to work on that 'cause that's kind of a tough one. 

01:25:40
MARY GRAHAM Uh. I don't even understand half of it. And she never explains it to me, she goes over and explains it to everybody else and I'm . . . 

01:25:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:25:45
MARY GRAHAM . . . sitting there like whatever. 

01:25:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:25:55
MARY GRAHAM But she's li-, constantly like, 'You never turn your homework in and stay after class, go to detention.' 

01:26:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:26:00
MARY GRAHAM As if that helps anything. 

01:26:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, that might be a tough one to work on. 

01:26:05
MARY GRAHAM I hate homework. Don't you think it's stupid? 

01:26:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well when I was a teacher I only gave really good homework. 

01:26:15
MARY GRAHAM I know I wish I had you. 

01:26:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do you believe that? 

01:26:15
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, no, I wish I had you in my class . . . 

01:26:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I just kidding you, I'm sure I gave kind of stupid homework at times. 

01:26:25
MARY GRAHAM No, because you like kids. I can, I can see you like me. You wouldn't give me stupid homework. 

01:26:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, you're likable. That's true. Now, um, I don't know, could you do part of the homework? 

01:26:40
MARY GRAHAM Yeah I can do, I can give it a go I guess. 

01:26:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Right. 

01:26:40
MARY GRAHAM I can do a little bit. 

01:26:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING How about one night? 

01:26:45
MARY GRAHAM One night in the week? 

01:26:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING That's more than I though, I was just thinking one night in the whole world. 

01:26:50
MARY GRAHAM I can . . . 

01:26:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING In the next eight months, but you're saying one night a week. 

01:26:55
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, I can do one night this year. 

01:27:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Okay. How about tonight? 

01:27:05
MARY GRAHAM I don't even know, like I'm here, so I'm missing her class. I don't even know what it is? Can I do it tomorrow? 

01:27:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well it's going to be tough to find out. 

01:27:10
MARY GRAHAM Can I just do it tomorrow? 

01:27:10
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Now, maybe we better work on something else. Tomorrow is a long way off. 

01:27:20
MARY GRAHAM I can't, I don't even know how to get the homework. I could do it tonight, but it, you, could you get the homework for me? 

01:27:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You got, you got friends? 

01:27:30
MARY GRAHAM Oh they don't do their homework. 

01:27:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Oh, well I could get the homework for you. Do you want me to do that? 

01:27:35
MARY GRAHAM If you could . . . 

01:27:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Do you want me to go to her and say, 'Look, Julie was out of your class, I was talking to her, I'm working with her, uh, you know, progress is slow, but you know I'm working with her, and she missed the homework.' 

01:27:50
MARY GRAHAM If you get me the homework I'll do it. But I don't want to ask her for it. 

01:27:50
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. That's fair enough. Now, I have to get, you have to come by my office here at the end of the day. In an hour and a half, you know I'll, it takes me some time to get to her. I'll write it down. 

01:28:05
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. What time? 

01:28:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, schools out at what, ten after three? 

01:28:10
MARY GRAHAM Can I come back last period for math? 

01:28:15
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No, no, only out of school once during the day. At the end of school on your way out. 

01:28:20
MARY GRAHAM I'd like it better if I could come during math. 

01:28:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, I know. 

01:28:25
MARY GRAHAM But I can come by after school. 

01:28:30
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Five or ten after. Or 11 after 3:00, whatever. Okay well we both have a plan, don't we. 

01:28:40
MARY GRAHAM So when are you going to talk to her? Are you going to talk to her tomorrow? 

01:28:40
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well I'm going to try to get to her today. 

01:28:40
MARY GRAHAM And tell her to be nice to me? 

01:28:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, I don't know if I can tell her that much. But I'll tell her I'm working with you and you're trying, and um, you know. 

01:28:55
MARY GRAHAM Tell her I'm not as bad as . . . 

01:28:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I have, I have to kind of get some in- . . . 

01:28:55
MARY GRAHAM . . . than she thinks. 

01:28:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING . . . I have to get some you know how you have to sense things. 

01:29:00
MARY GRAHAM Just tell her I'm not as bad. 

01:29:00
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING To expect her to be nice overnight, how realistic is that? 

01:29:05
MARY GRAHAM I don't know, I don't think she has one nice bone in her body. 

01:29:05
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Well, I'll be asking you to find one. 

01:29:15
[sil.] 

01:29:20
MARY GRAHAM See I'm not bad. 

01:29:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I never said you're bad. Did I say you were bad? 

01:29:20
MARY GRAHAM No I'm just saying. You're like the only person here that doesn't think I'm bad. 

01:29:25
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING No, now there's two people that think that. You know who the other one is? 

01:29:30
MARY GRAHAM No. 

01:29:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING You. 

01:29:35
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, yeah, you're right, because I'm not bad. 

01:29:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah. You're not bad, no, you're not. Now you're doing some thing that aggravate Ms. Bannan. 

01:29:40
MARY GRAHAM A couple little mess ups. Whatever. 

01:29:45
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, let's see if we can make that couple, you know just one less. Are you willing to work on that? 

01:29:50
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, if you talk to Ms. Bannan. 

01:29:55
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING I'm going to talk to her. 

01:29:55

ROBERT E WUBBOLDING And then, um, so, so uh, I'll talk to you briefly in the hallway as you leave today. And ten tomorrow when you come by, when you come in, would you go by my office and just tell me how it went tonight with the homework? 

01:30:20
MARY GRAHAM Mm-hm. 

01:30:20
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING It will be a five second conversation. 

01:30:20

MARY GRAHAM Yeah I can do that. 

01:30:35
ROBERT E WUBBOLDING Okay. Alright, now, you want to shake hands on this, this means you're really going to do what you said you're going to do, and it means that I'm going to do what I said I would do? 

01:30:40
MARY GRAHAM Yeah, I guess.
