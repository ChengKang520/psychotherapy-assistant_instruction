Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 info@emicrotraining.com www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates Presents Plenary Panel Session III: Research Findings on Culture and Mental Health in Ethnic Minority Communities Using Nationally-Representative Data Presenters: Laura Kohn-Wood, James Jackson, Norah Mulvaney-Day and David Takeuchi Videotaped at the Division 45 Conference Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues Ann Arbor, Michigan June 2010 

00:00:15
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Welcome and thank you for coming to the final plenary of the first annual Division 45 Conference. I want to start off um… by acknowledging and thanking the 2010 Division 45 Conference Planning Committee, um… that would be Robert Sellers, Alfiee Breland-Noble, Tabby Chaves(ph), Melanie Domenech Rodriguez, (inaudible ), Joseph Ghan(ph), Julie Green(ph), Gordon Hall(ph), Sean Joe(ph), Deborah Johnson(ph), Fredley Huang(ph), Jackie Metzler(ph) and (inaudible ) Cheryl Talley and Michael A. Zirato. So, if um… you could please just join me in thanking the conference planning committee for putting on a wonderful conference. We're going to begin with this panel on cultural and mental health. Um… we are going to ask each panelist to talk for 20 minutes after I introduce all of them. Then we will save some time at the end for questions and discussion as we did yesterday. And then I asked you to stay at the very end because Robert Sellers has…wants to address you for just a few minutes before we go on to the reception. So, I'm thrilled to be here moderating this panel, this is truly a distinguished panel and I am going to just introduce each of the panelist, um, all of them at once and then we will ask each of them to come up in turn and present their comments. First we have Dr. David Takeuchi, who is a preeminent sociologist and Associate Dean of Research in the School of Social Work at the University of Washington with appointments in both social work and the department of Sociology. As you know, he has a long history of examining racial, socioeconomic and cultural factors that are associated with health and mental health. And he has been a primary investigator for the NLAAS study, the National Latino and Asian American Study as well as the current NLAAS II, which focuses on clinical services and a recent study um… funded by NICHD on education and health among racial groups. He is going to give us a brief history on large-scale national epidemiologic surveys and then focus on findings related to the Asian-American population as well as current issues in Asian-American mental health. Please join me in welcoming Dr. David Takeuchi, but I'm going to then introduce the next panelist after you. Secondly, we will hear from Dr. Norah Mulvaney-Day, she is a research associate at the centre for Multi-Cultural And Mental Health Research um… and she is a mental health ser…services researcher as well as social policy analyst with the background in community based participatory action research at Cambridge Health Alliance. She is also an instructor in the department of Psychiatry at the Cambridge Health Alliance Harvard Medical School. She works with Dr. Margarita Alegria and she will focus on findings related to race and mental health diagnosis across sub-groups as well as service use among Latinos and other groups. So, please join me in welcoming Dr. Norah Mulvaney-Day. And finally, we will hear from Dr. James S. Jackson. He is the Daniel Katz Distinguished University Professor of Psychology, here at the University of Michigan, as well as a professor of health behavior and health education in the School of Public Health and the director of the institute for social research. James Jackson pioneered the large national survey methods, now used by many to advance the rigor and breath and richness that has been applied to the study of African Americans in the United States, with his founding development of the program for research on black Americans, here at University of Michigan. He's continued his extraordinary trajectory to investigate the influences of race, race and ethni…ethnicity on multiple aspects of life and functioning for Blacks throughout the dispora, diaspora excuse me. And he, um, has been a primary investigator for the national survey of um, ah… of a… the national survey of American life, the national survey of ethnic pluralism and politics and the family survey across generations and nations, um… here at the University of Michigan. Many of us have been inspired and mentored, um by James Jackson, those of us interested in race, culture and mental health among African Americans and he will be talking about race, ethnicity and how the intersection of contacts influences developments. So, join me in welcoming Dr. James Jackson.

Making Ends Meet: Financial Problems and Mental Health among Asian Americans David T. Takeuchi, Ph.D. University of Washington Presented at the APA Division 45 Conference Ann Arbor, Michigan June 19, 2010 

00:04:30
That was a Michigan time hahaha. 

00:04:35
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Well, thank you so much ah Laura, and again I want to extend my congratulations to Robert and the planning committee for hosting this first ever Division 45 Conference. Ah, I'm gonna apologize in advance that I am not technologically efficient, so I'm going to mess up here and its actually my plan strategy because all my life, I've ah fought stereotypes and this gets related(ph) to the stereotypes about Asian Americans. So, the, the purpose of this talk I'll provide a little short history of NSAL and NLAAS. 

00:05:10
Purpose of this talk • Provide a short history of NSAL and NLAAS • Tribute to a scholar who recently retired • Present analysis of financial problems and mental health among Asian Americans 

00:05:10
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI And before I do that I am gonna pay tribute to a scholar who has had a major impression on the field of culture and mental health and um, who has also had a, a personal tie with me. And then I am going to present analysis of financial problems which takes a little different look at Asian Americans. 

00:05:30
Stanley Sue • Distinguished research contributions from Division 45 • Ground breaking studies on social and cultural factors o the use of mh services • Pioneer in focusing on issues confronting diverse communities 

00:05:35
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Stanley Sue is retiring or retired this year. And ah… he was recognized by Division 45, I believe in 1990 with ah with distinguished research contributions. He has had a long-lasting impact on looking at social and cultural factors ah and the use of mental health services. And um he is also been one of the pioneers in focusing on issues confronting diverse communities. And when I look at his life ah beginning ah his research beginning in the early 70s, its amazing that ah he was able to accomplish ah so much, ah given the tenure of the times where Asian Americans were actually not ah recognized as legitimate research population, so lot of kudos to him. I first met Stan in 1989, when I was a struggling postdoc coming out of Yale. Now, I'm still struggling, but much older. And ah in 1989, Stan and I met and he offered me the position of associate director with National Research Centre on Asian American mental health which was just starting and funded by NIMH. And I must say being in academia was not part of my original plan, I'd never thought about academia even after the postdoc at Yale and Stan really had a major impression on my research career and personal life and I know without his major ah role in offering the position, I would never, I would not be here and certainly not had done ah done the kind of work I've ah done over my career. So I just want to recognize Stan because ah in, in much of the studies that I am going to talk about ah he had a major influence of his research provided to foundation for this research program. 

00:07:35
Genealogy of CPES Rosalind Carter White House Conference on Mental Health (1978) ECA Studies (1979 - 84) 

00:07:40
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Ah I am into genealogies, because I like to trace not only peoples personal background, but I would like to follow the kind of intellectual background. And ah the studies NSAL, NLAAS I think I personally can trace two different factors in history. And from my own personal experiences I see that the origins comes from Lisa Rosalind Carter's White House Conference on Mental Health where one of the major findings is that we really had no national estimates or the need for mental health services ah among ah in the United States and for different racial ethnic minorities. That led ah fairly quickly to the ECA studies. Ah… in the past before the ECA studies, many of the community studies were done by clinician psychiatrists and clinical psychologist, and we know how expensive they are. So, ah people were always looking for ways to do these kind of clinical mental health assessments ah in more inexpensive ways because they wanted to get at the community samples where you could look at unmet need. And so the ECA studies developed the diagnostic interview schedule, which was a way to administer diagnostic ah and get diagnostic clinical evaluations ah from respondents and community samples. And it provided a computer algorithm to compute these kinds of diagnostics. Ah that eventually led to the national comorbidity study done by Ron Kessler and his group ah and interviews were done by University of Michigan. And the NCS was the first national study of mental health problems, the ECA studies were actually done in five different communities across the United States, so people thought that they could derive national estimates from these five community studies, but that was an error, Kessler and his group actually did the first national study getting at these kinds of ah clinical evaluations. Ah national comorbidity study also developed a protocol which all of our studies have used which was to ah establish screening or stem questions in front-end(ph) questionnaires and, and then respondents eventually moved to diagnostic parts. What the ECA studies found were that um when they had these diagnostic protocols back to back people eventually learn that the quicker they say no, the faster they get out of the interviews. So the race of mental health problems for the first disorders were much higher than the disorders in the later section. So, Kessler and his group developed this screening question and put it up front and that allowed people to get into diagnostic sections here with more speed.

Genealogy of CPES Rosalind Carter White House Conference on Mental Health (1978) ECA Studies (1979 - 84) NCS (1991) Community Studies Clinton Initiatives on Race/Health Disparities NSAL NLAAS 

00:10:50
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Um I'm sorry, what I'm missing here which ah this particular slide doesn’t have. I also want to put in a short out to the NSBA, the National Survey of Black Americans, which ah is came before the NCS and after the ECA studies or right around the ECA studies, which ah provided um an amazing way of getting at relativity rare populations, in this case black Americans and to provide some systematic way of getting at these rare populations in the national sample. The NSBA also provided a great strategy in that we relied on for all these studies of providing date, meaningful data sets for minority scholars. So, the NSAL and NLAAS which we'll be talking about have provided rich sources of data from minority scholars, I think its if it's not the most, it's one of the most downloaded data sets in the ICPSR regimen at the University of Michigan. Um okay, back to the Genealogy, various community studies have been done on different racial ethnic minority populations and I also want to give credit to the Clinton initiative on race and health in the 90s where Bill Clinton and his administration, a call for a conversation about race. Well, you can ah... discuss a debate, how effective that conversation was. It did provide the impetus for lot of the federal agencies including NIH to look more carefully at issues of race and ethnicity. A prior to this conversation, ah many of the national institutes of health program people actually discouraged people from including terms like race, ethnicity in their application. They wanted a more neutral term like culture. So these eventually led to the National Survey of American Lives and the National Latino and Asian American Studies and Norah and James will provide a little bit more detail about each of their analysis. I am going to focus on one part of the NLAAS on Asian Americans and um talk about one specific set of findings, ah just briefly NLAAS is the first national study of its kind on Asian Americans and Latinos. 

00:13:30
NLAAS Features First national study of its kind Exact sampling design and questionnaire features Addresses similarities and differences among Latinos and Asian Americans 

00:13:35
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI It has ah very systematic way of sampling and ah some unique questionnaire features and one of the key part in this collaboration is that we wanted to look at issues that were common across Asian and Latino populations specially around immigration. Because in the past, it's been difficult to compare findings for Asian and Latinos because they've often used different designs and questionnaires. And in NLAAS we provide the commonalities in which you could make these kinds of comparisons. 

00:14:10
Special Features of NLAAS • First national study of Latinos & Asian Americans. • Multiple ethnic groups, multiple languages. • Allows for comparisons - esp. on immigration. • Complex sampling design. • Language experiment • Services experiment. 

00:14:10
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Um, again it’s a first national study, of Latinos and Asian Americans it include multiple ethnic groups for um Latinos, it includes Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and other Latinos and for Asian Americans it includes large samples of Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino and other Asians. Ah… the questionnaires were translated into Spanish, ah Tagalog, Cantonese, Mandarin and Vietnamese and again it allows for these multiple comparisons ah on ah a number of different issues. Ah we did in our just touch upon… just briefly we did conduct a language experiment um on, in Spanish where a proportion of people were administered the interview in Spanish and another proportion interview in English to see if language had an effect on how people respond. And we also have services experiment in this particular thing whether the ordering into question actually had an effect on how respondents reported, how often they use various kinds of services. 

00:15:25
Study Design Extensive screening for respondent selection Eligible respondents: Adults 18+ Dual sampling strategy 

00:15:25
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI I do want to mention that um one of my ah a key collaborated by my colleague Margarita Alegria was the principal investigator with myself on NLAAS and ah both of us had a, a great relationship over a almost 10-year period both trying to get the the study funded as well as continuing the analyses. Ah the study design included extended screening for respondents, respondents were 18 and over and we had a dual sampling strategy in which we try to get national estimates of Latinos and Asian Americans and their mental health. Ah by dual sampling strategy, we oversampled areas for Asian Americans and Latinos who are 5% or more in a given area, but we also sampled areas where they were ah less than 5%. 

00:16:20
List of Mental Disorders Depression Suicidality Panic Disorder Personality Substance Use Social Phobia Agoraphobia Post Traumatic Stress Generalized Anxiety Neurasthenia Ataques de Nervios Eating disorder Separation Anxiety Premenstrual Syndrome Attention Deficit Psychosis Oppositional-Defiant Conduct Disorder 

00:16:20
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI And just briefly the kinds of mental health problems that we, we looked at and I'm going to focus on depression but you can see it was a fairly extent is list of mental disorder that we, we looked at. 

00:16:35
Social & Cultural Variables Adult Demographics Social Position Detention Migration Status and History Language Preference Acculturative Stress Family & Social Support Family Cohesion Discrimination 

00:16:35
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI And these are some of the ah kinds of variables that we included ah on social and cultural kinds of issues. 

00:16:40
Today’s Presentation Cultural factors usually a focus for Asian Americans Change of pace by discussing economic stress and how it impacts Asian Americans Date comes from NLAAS. 

00:16:45
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Today, I am going to take a little, little different tact, ah often when we look at Asian American populations, we often focus on culture factors especially cultural differences and I am going to change a pace little bit by talking about economic stress, we often don’t hear about that the common problems Asian Americans may encounter with other Americans and I'm going to talk about economic stress and how it impacts Asian Americans. Again the data comes from National Latino Asian American Study. Um... so the data comes from NLAAS. 

00:17:25
General Themes in Economic Life and Mental Health Social causation or drift (or both?) Persistence of economic stress The long reach of childhood Theory of limited difference 

00:17:30
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI Ah just some ah really quick ways of ah how people researchers have looked at economic life and mental health. Ah there is a debate about social causation or drift whether people who had mental health problems actually drift into a different poverty or different kinds of low SCS ah statuses. Um there is a persistence of economic stress that is often looked at especially in ah longitudinal studies and um one of the areas that people have been looking at with increased frequency is how childhood SCS can have these long-term consequences on adult health and mental health. Ah the theory of limited difference, if I'd more time and maybe we can talk about this in discussion, really focuses on looking at the long-terms effects in terms of the accumulation of advantage and disadvantages over timed the results in a long-term impactful consequence in adulthood. And again I would be happy to talk about that in more detail later if there is time. Ah just a brief context, when this study was conducted, ah the economic problems were not as severe as it is today, but you can see even um when you look at these data in 2001 there was a tremendous and growing disparity in terms of income over time. The fifth quintile um was far and above over most of the other quintiles in terms of income. Again this demonstrates the disproportionality in terms of income ah and how ah American society is become, has become one of the haves and haves-not. This quickly shows you in some of the kinds of um economic capital beyond income and ah the kinds of disparities they are in ownership and wealth in American society. Um again we can talk more about this ah later in discussion if there is time. There is another way looking at economic crisis. This is the debt to income ratio. This is in 2007 and you can see the top 1% in United State had more income than debt. The next 19% had a slightly more debt than income and for most of us probably there is a lot more ah, debt than income. This is a kind of similar notion that shows you how the debt/income ratio has increased overtime and ah, it has grown tremendously in 2004 and I actually haven’t had a chance to update these to 2010, but I would imagine that increase in debt has far surpass income in contemporary times. 

00:20:45
Financial Stress Questions Would you say your family living here has enough money? • Not enough • Enough • More than needed How difficult is it to pay your monthly bills? • Very difficult •Somewhat difficult • Not very difficult • Not at all difficult 

00:20:50
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI In the analysis I'm going to talk about very briefly, it refers to financial stress and these are the two questions I focus on. Ah, whether family members had enough money and how difficult it is to pay your monthly bills. 

00:21:05
Mental Disorders • Affective includes major depression and dysthymia • Anxiety includes phobia, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD • Substance disorder includes alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse, drug dependence • Any disorder includes affective, anxiety or substance 

00:21:10
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Ah, I looked at a whole bunch of disorders and I’ll report upon them in the next slides. 

00:21:10
What Is Not Associated With Financial Stress? • Education • Family cohesion • Ethnic identity • English proficiency 

00:21:15
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Ah very briefly what is not associative financial stress in these analysis; education, cohesion, identity and language proficiency or English proficiency. 

00:21:25
What Is Associated With Financial Stress? • Marital status • Gender • Income • Age • Subjective social status (-) • Neighborhood safety (-) • Everyday discrimination (+) • Perceived group discrimination (+) • Family support (+) • Friend support (+) 

00:21:25
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI And these are the factors that seem to be associated with ah, increased financial stress. Ah, this is a table or a graph that shows 12 month mental disorders. This is all mental disorders by gender and financial stress for US born respondents and this is ah, for males and females and this is for those who reported a high number of financial stress indicators. As you can see among the stress to U.S. born females ah, have a high proportion of people who have a mental health problem. Oops, little quick there is my Asian tendency and as you can see there is a nice association that there between stress and the non-stress population in terms of mental health disorder, any disorder and this next set of bars looks at affective disorders including dysthymia and depression and as you can see a females in this case, ah had a higher association between financial stress and mental disorder. This is for the non-stress and again if you see a little an association even for men where men who experience the financial stress have higher rates of mental affective disorders than those who did not experience. Ah, these are the other kinds of disorders fairly similar pattern for anxiety disorders and substance use disorder. There is a genders difference around substance use disorder which we would expect but generally for U.S. born respondents, it seems to a show that financial stress is highly associated with mental disorders and again these analysis control for all the other factors that I showed in terms of ah, in a previous two slides. This is for immigrant respondents. Ah, little different pattern where men, immigrant men who are stressed have higher rates of different mental health problems and ah, women who, immigrant women did not experience financial stress actually had higher rates of mental health problems in them. So you see a little different pattern for immigrants. And this holds true for the affective disorder. Men in this case had a higher rates of affective disorder if they experience some financial stress. So, one of these analysis and I think one of the beauty of having data such like this, it allows you to look at an issue in far more detail and actually understand the complexities. I’m not gonna kind of dwell on some of the reasons why you may find these gender differences but it does go to the notion that when you have these kinds of data set, it allows you to understand the complexities and a new answers of about how even gender and financial stress may operate quite differently and it's not as uniform as we might predict. 

00:25:05
Implications of Analyses • Financial conditions in the US has worsened since 2003 • Government cutbacks in services • Services are being limited to severely disabled 

00:25:10
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI So quickly I'll summarize some of the implications. The financial conditions has worsened. So some of these issues probably have got even more severe. There has been severe cutbacks in mental health services and most mental health programs are now serving the, the most severely disabled. So many of the folks that I’ve been talking about who have developed mental health problems are probably not getting services in local communities and since financial conditions have worsened that population of people who may be in serious need of mental health programs may actually not be getting it. Anyway, thank you for your time and we'll look forward to the discussion. 

00:25:55

Understanding Mental Health Services Disparities using the National Latino and Asian American study Norah Mulvaney-Day, Ph.D. Margarita Alegria, Ph.D. Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School 

00:26:15
You are not the only one. 

00:26:15
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Alright. hahahaha. 

00:26:20
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Good afternoon every one. First of all I just want to thank um, Dr. Sellers and, and the Division for inviting me here today and I want to express how honored I feel to be on such a distinguished panel. It’s really a great honor and, and very exciting for me. Ah, I’m gonna talk today about a number of different studies that we’ve done using the NLAAS. Ah, I wanna, I’m gonna focus primarily on some of the Latino findings but many of them are in recent papers, we have also done using um, the combined CPS studies. So there are some ah, some of the studies will also include some of the other racial and ethnic groups as well. Ah, and I wanna also before I start to acknowledge Margarita Alegria who is the Director of our center, (inaudible ) David on the NLAAS and its through her leadership and vision that these studies have been conducted. She is ah, sorry that she can't be here as well today. Alright, we’ve talked a little bit about ah, large data sets and what these representative studies with robust samples of ethnic and racial minorities. 

00:27:25
Large, nationally representative studies with robust samples of ethnic/racial minorities and immigrants are critical to plan for mental health care needs Significant heterogeneity within racial/ethnic groups Extensive geographic variation Local samples may bias our understanding of service system needs at the national level 

00:27:25
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY How they can help us understand patterns. Umm, as most of us know there is significant heterogeneity within racial and ethnic groups and really extensive geographic variation. So having these large studies really will help us get a better picture of what’s going on. Local samples may bias our understanding of service system needs at the national level. I’m gonna skip a couple of slides as I go here just because I’m a little or too ambitious so um hahha. So I’m just gonna jump right to the over view of, of what I wanna do in this presentation. 

00:27:55
Overview of presentation Highlights NLAAS findings that illustrate how this large nationally representative study has enabled a more nuanced understanding of patterns of mental health disorder and service use among Latinos and other racial/ethnic minorities Prevalence rates of mental health Dx Immigrant and US born comparisons Early onset of disorder Mental health services Quality of care Barriers to care 

00:28:00
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Essentially, I just wanna kind of give you a broad over view of some of the NLAAS findings that illustrate how this large nationally representative study has enabled a more nuanced understanding of patterns of mental health disorder and service use among Latinos and other racial/ethnic minorities and I’m gonna walk you through some findings from sort of the first stage of the NLAAS where we looked prevalence rates of mental health disorder focusing primarily on immigrant and US born comparisons. I’m also gonna briefly talk, touch on a study that was recently done looking at early onset of psychiatric disorder and then I’m gonna talk about Mental health services disparities and some of the studies we’ve done that highlight um, both the existence of um, service disparities and also some of the um, areas that may be driving these disparities. 

00:28:45
Latino Sample NLAAS measure psychiatric disorders and mental health service usage in a nationally-representative household sample of Asians and Latinos. Analysis sample includes 2554 NLAAS Latino respondents 18+ Inclusion of Latino subgroups: 868 Mexicans, 577 Cubans, 495 Puerto Ricans and 614 Other Latinos. Descriptive statistics and models are weighted using nationally-representative survey weights. 

00:28:50
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Just briefly the Latino sample included 868 Mexicans, 577 Cubans, 495 Puerto Ricans and 614 Other. 

00:29:00
Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders Across Latino Subgroups in the United States Alegria. M, Mulvaney-Day, N. Torres, M., Polo, Antonio et al., (2007) American Journal of Public Health, 97:1, 68-75. 

00:29:00
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY And in this first paper what we did is we looked at psychiatric disorders focusing specifically on Latinos and we found um, we looked in this, this table you can see um, we looked across a lot of cultural and um, nativity, immigration variables and we looked at the odds of any 12-month disorder for men and for women and you can see if you look at the ethnic groups that’s the first comparison, that Mexicans and other Latinos both men and women and Cuban man as well are significantly less likely to have a past 12-month psychiatric disorder than Puerto Ricans. So right away we see this heterogeneity within the Latino group. Looking at nativity for the Latino sample as a whole, if you were born outside of the US, you have lower significantly lower odds of any 12-month disorder. This is sometimes referred to as a immigrant paradox where individuals that are born outside of the US have a healthier profile than those who are born in the US. Ah, following from the previous slide English proficiency more likely to have a 12-month disorder both men and women and then when you um, when we were able to disaggregate years in the US. So, we took, we took the nativity variable and we broke it down according to the amount of time that the individuals had spent in the US. What we find is that the longer you’ve been in the US, the more you look like the US. So, the ones who are born, who had been in the US 0-5 years and for women and men from 6-10 years with the two groups that had significantly lower likelihood of mental health disorder compared it to the US born. But once you had a 11-20 and 21+ years there is virtually no difference between the immigrant group and the US born. So this was of interest and what we wanted to do next was zero in on disaggregating further some of these nativity differences that we saw in this first study and looking across race and ethnicity, looking across subgroups, Latino subgroups. 

00:31:05
Prevalence of Mental Illness in Immigrant and Non-immigrant US Latino Groups Alegria, M., Canino, G., Shrout, P., Woo, M. et al (2008), American Journal of Psychiatry, 165:3, 359-365. 

00:31:05
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Do these nativity and do these um, differences by US born verse non-US born hold up across all of the sub samples of Latinos or either differences? And we find there are differences. This is a, this is a busy(ph) slide but there is a lot of really um, I think important information here. First of all, on the far left we looked at any depressive disorder, any anxiety disorder, any substance and any disorder as a whole. And the first row is actually the non-Latino white sample from the NCSR and the second is the combined Latino sample. And what you notice first is that for both US born and immigrants across disorders the Latino group has lower rates of disorder than the US um, than the Non-Latino Whites and in previous um, analysis in this paper these differences were significant. But what’s most important here is when you break down the Latino group into Puerto Rican and Cuban Mexican and other, you see that this difference for US born versus immigrant that we see in the Latinos as a whole doesn’t hold up across all subgroups. So, pretty much the Mexican group is what's driving the nativity difference. For Mexicans the depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, immigrant Mexicans are…have lower rates um, than the US born. But for example, for Puerto Ricans there are none of the differences between Puerto Ricans that are born in the US Mainland versus Puerto Ricans born on the island. There are no differences between US born and immigrant. So you can see that when you break down the sample and you look um, it’s important to see that not all of these groups are operating the same way. I wanna also draw your attention however to substance and for substance that’s the one disorder that did seem to hold up in terms of the US born versus immigrant distinction. So, for Cubans 6.4% of immigrants versus 20.9% of US born, 5.7% of other Latinos compared to 20.4% of US born. So something is going on substance that seems to be working across Latino groups. That’s perhaps different than some of these other disorders. 

00:33:20
Rates of Psychiatric Disorder for Latino Elders (Jiminez,D., Alegria. M. et al. 2010.) Older Latinos have equal or worse rates of psychopathology compared to older non-Latino whites Any depression disorder for older Latinos 8.6%, for non-Latino whites elders 5.3%(p‹05) Exploratory analyses show immigrant elders have higher rates of depressive and anxiety disorders than U.S. born Latino elders Stress of migration may be more extreme for older Latino adults 

00:33:25
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Okay, now more recently what we’ve done is we’ve actually taken the, taken advantage of the NLAAS um, in order to look not only at issues around um breaking down Latinos into subgroups but also looking at the sample as a whole and looking at different demographic groups. So one of the groups that we’ve looked at is looking at elders and what we found interestingly in this study is that the picture for Latino elders doesn’t look the same as the picture we’ve been seeing in the previous couple of slides. Older Latinos in fact have equal or worse rates of psychopathology compared to older non-Latino whites. So when you, when you restrict the sample to an older population some of the um what we were seeing in terms of Latinos not having a um as high rates of disorder as non-Latino whites that doesn’t hold up. Um, 8.6% of older Latinos have depressive disorder compared to 5.3% of non-Latino white elders. Um and then further exploratory analyses show immigrant elders have higher rates of depressive and anxiety disorders than U.S. born elders. So, there is some interesting difference once we start breaking this sample down and looking at the subgroups. 

00:34:40
Summary of findings on rates of mental health disorder among Latinos Male and female Latinos immigrants less likely to have mental health disorder than U.S. born Higher likelihood of Dx among English language proficient; with increased time in US Rates of disorder vary by subgroup, with Puerto Ricans demonstrating highest risk Evidence of an “Immigrant Paradox” most striking for Mexicans Different patterns for Latino elders Assessing Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Social Consequences of Early-Onset Psychiatric Disorder Cook, B.L., Carsen. N., Alegria, M. ((2010)), Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved, 21(2 suppl), 49-66. 

00:34:50
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Alright. So I’m gonna skip this summary and keep going here. um, briefly I’m gonna touch on this paper. This is looking at another component of the NLAAS that we are excited that we are able to do due to numbers. We are looking here at the differences in social consequences of early-onset psychiatric disorder. So, what the NLAAS has enabled us to do is that it’s enable, we’ve been able to look at, at one point in the life cycle did individuals um first become symptomatic and what are the effects of early-onset of psychiatric disorder on social outcomes. And I’m quickly gonna just kind of over view this because I don’t have that much time but this included the entire um, CPS sample. So this included the Asians, the African Americans, the Afro Caribbean’s and the Non-Latino Whites. And as the sample as a whole what you can see here is according to four social indicators; unemployment, lack of a high school education, report of arrest and welfare. There are significant differences between those who have psychiatric disorder youth onset verse those with adult onset. And when we start breaking down across racial and ethnic groups what is interesting is that within groups the Whites and the blacks also have significant differences. This is for unemployment. Latino seem to have the same pattern but not significant but then the Asians are have a reverse pattern with adults having um higher rates of unemployment than those who have psychiatric disorder at, in youth. So maybe we can talk about that. 

00:36:25
KEY FINDINGS Despite within group differences, no differences between groups in social consequences of early onset of psychiatric disorder Higher rates of social disadvantage for Blacks and Latinos to start Negative social outcomes for those with early onset reinforce need for preventive services and early intervention 

00:36:30
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Um similar patterns for high school education and the thing that’s really important to know is that despite the fact that they were within group differences, when we look to see if there were differences across racial and ethnic groups in the um negative consequences of early-onset, there were none. So, it seems that across the board um, early-onset is detrimental no matter what your race and ethnicity. It is important however to know that they were higher rates of social disadvantage for blacks and Latinos to start and that is something that you can see for example in this slide that is pretty pronounced for high school education. 

00:37:05
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE DISPARITIES 

00:37:10
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Okay, so let me switch gears and talk a little bit now about some of our mental health service disparities um, findings through the NLAAS. 

00:37:15
Disparity in Access to and Quality of Depression Treatment among Racial and Ethnic Minorities in the US Alegria, M., Chatterji, P., Well, K., Cao, Z. et al (2008), Psychiatric Services, 59(11), 1264-72 

00:37:15
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Um, this is a paper looking at disparities in access to and quality of depression treatment among racial and ethnic minorities. 

00:37:20
Significantly lower rates of access and minimally adequate treatment For those with last year depressive disorder, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians and 58.8% of African Americans, vs. 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any last year mental health treatment (p‹0.001). Among those with depression who accessed care, African-Americans were significantly less likely than non-Latino whites to receive adequate treatment (p‹0.001) 

00:37:25
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY And this paper demonstrates a truly um, troubling under treatment for depression for racial and ethnic minorities. You can see here that um, 40.2% of non-Latino whites did not access any last year mental health treatment um, much, much lower than the 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians and 58.8% of African Americans and we look, when we looked at those who already had depression um, and who accessed care, African-Americans were significantly less likely than non-Latino whites to receive adequate treatment. And this is a table that pretty much shows the same thing. These are the predicted probabilities combining both access and receive of quality care. Again um, pretty low percentages overall but the Whites 33.4% compared to 25% of Latinos, 18.9% of Asians and 10.4% of African Americans. 

00:38:20
Summary of Findings Racial and ethnic minorities with depression (or without any disorder) less likely to access any treatment compared to non-Latino whites. Taken together, Latinos, Asians and African-Americans with depression were on average 9 to 23 percentage points less likely to access and receive minimally adequate depression treatment compared to non-Latino whites. 

00:38:20
Barriers I. Discontinuation of psychiatric medication among Latinos (Hodgkin et al., 2008) II. English Language Proficiency (Bauer et al., in press) III. Substitution of informal for specialty care to treat mental health problems (Camacho, in preparation) 

00:38:25
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY So, what is you know, what could be driving these disparities? What is the sources of a lot of this, of this under treatment? Um, a few papers I’ve looked in the last year or so at different ah, service system components that could be um, driving this. One paper looks at discontinuation of psychiatric medication among Latinos looking at whether um, whether that might be an area of, of concern. Our second paper has focused on English language proficiency and third is looking at the substitution of informal for specialty care to treat mental health problems. So these are all issues that have come up around barriers to treatment to these groups. 

00:39:10
I. Discontinuation of Antidepressants among Latinos (NLAAS=180) 33% discontinued using antidepressants 19% without input from “medical professional supervising care” Demographic predictors of discontinuation in multivariate analyses: Younger (18-35 years old) Unmarried Uninsurance Limited English Proficiency Problem recognition was not predictive 

00:39:15
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Um so, the discontinuation of antidepressant paper. This paper found that among Latinos who had reported using antidepressants within the last year 33% had discontinued using and 19% reported discontinuing without input from a medical professional supervising the care. Um, predictors of this from a demographic predictors, people who are younger, people who are unmarried, uninsurance and limited English proficiency. These were all predictors of discontinuation. Um, Problem recognition interestingly enough was not predictive. Um, so it didn’t matter if the person recognize, acknowledge that they had a problem or not. That didn’t seem to have a relationship with whether or not they continued using antidepressants. 

00:40:00
Service system predictors of discontinuation Reported barriers to care providers spent limited time; wait >1 hour, lack of continuity of care) ‹8 visits of psychologist, social worker or counselor predicted stopping without input 

00:40:05
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY And when we looked at the service system predictors in this paper, those who reported barriers to care were more likely to discontinue. And interestingly those who reported fewer than eight visits to a psychologist, social worker or counselor were much more likely to predict stopping use of antidepressants without input from the medical professional that was supervising the care. So what this suggest is that individuals who are receiving medication in primary care perhaps without concomitant um specialty mental health care perhaps are at risk for a, for inappropriate discontinuation. 

00:40:40
II. Relationship between English Language Proficiency and MH service use Some studies show lower (Alegria et al., 2007) and some show higher use of MH services (Folsom et al., 2007, Gilmer et al., 2007) Using the NLAAS, hypothesized that those with lifetime psychiatric disorders and LEP: Greater levels of unmet need for mental health treatment Less likely to identify as needing treatment More likely to endorse stigma barriers 

00:40:45
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Looking at English language proficiency and mental health service use. This is an area that people often tribute under treatment to you know, the challenges of individuals who don’t speak English, negotiating the system. In fact, studies have been mixed, some studies have found that um, individuals with limited English proficiency have higher um, are, are less likely to use mental health services and some have shown that in fact they have better use in some community health agencies. Um, the studies that tend to show the better use tend to be use, tend to use administrative data, they are not usually, nationally representative samples and they also tend to focus on um, receive of services at a single point in time. So they don’t look at for example history of treatment, how many years of lack of treatment have individuals gone through? So, this particular paper actually wanted to look at that, they wanted to look um, not just that you know, who reports being on treatment currently but how many years did they go without treatment after first acknowledging that they had a disorder. So the hypothesis were that people with limited English proficiency would have greater levels of unmet need, would be less likely to identify as needing treatment and would be more likely to endorse stigma barriers. And so, this is, this is the table from that study um and what you can see is that the first two columns are the limited English proficiency and the second two are English proficient and for Latinos who reported a lifetime um psychiatric disorder. People who were those who were English proficient had higher rates of any health care treatment and they also had higher rates of special…specialist care um, in those who were both significant. Um, when you go down to the second row of findings you can see for years of untreated disorder those with limited English proficiency had a mean of 14.6% of um, untreated disorder and that was compared to 9.4 for the English proficient and that was a significant comparison. Um, so that is definitely an area of concern for people with limited English proficiency. Again, we see in the next row that self identified need for treatment did not come out as a significant factor although there is some trend towards it in the English proficient and then lastly the final um, row looks at stigma barriers and the question was would you be embarrassed if friends knew you were getting professional help? Here we had ah, finding that was contrary to hypothesis in that those who were English proficient were 31.2% um, 31.2% of them endorse that finding compared to only 14% of those with limited English proficiency and this was very significant ah difference. So that’s of note. 

00:43:40
III. Use of Informal Care for Mental Health Problems Underutilization of mental health services by ethnic/racial minority groups may be due to substitution of alternative/informal healers to address mental health problems (Payne, 2009 Woodward, 2008, Cheung & Snowden, 1990 Used NLAAS to study the rates of informal mental health service use across race and ethnicity. 

00:43:40
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY And then lastly looking at informal care in all move quickly through this one. Um, another hypothesis is that racial and ethnic minorities may go experience under treatment for specialty care because they are substituting other types of care for that specialty care. We use the NLAAS to look at this and we did not find it at all. We found the racial and ethnic minorities were actually less likely to use informal services for mental health compared to Whites. Um, you can see it on the row, it says alternative therapies 28% of White reported using alternative therapies for mental health compared to 10.5% of Latinos, 12.9% of Asians and 14.4% of blacks. So, what I mean, one explanation could be that this was asked um, informal services for mental health care and that may be that, that, the critical factor here they may be using alternative sources of care for other physical health concerns. This paper is still in process but these are the kinds of findings that we, we consider having these nationally representative samples enable us to understand. 

00:44:50
Conclusions and Implications for Disparities Critical to increase attention to issues of access/engagement in mental health care for Latinos Not just any engagement but the right kind of engagement (e.g., language appropriate, specialist care) System factors may be a more critical focus than problem recognition in addressing disparities in mental health treatment 

00:44:50
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY So, just in conclusion um, given the under treatment and the problems with access it seems like it’s critical to continue to look at initial access and engagement in mental health care for Latinos and it’s also important to um consider not just any engagement but the right kind of engagement, language appropriate, specialist care and so on. Um, system factors may be in more critical focus than problem recognition in addressing disparities in mental health care. 

00:45:25
Importance of nationally representative studies to understand patterns Immigrant versus US born distinction Social advantage and early onset Identification of factors driving mental health service disparities Guide policy makers and clinicians in efforts to improve access to and quality of mental health care for racial/ethnic minorities 

00:45:25
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY And then again just to underscore the importance of the nationally representative studies to understand patterns you know, we saw very different pictures when we disaggregated immigrant versus US born distinction across the different um ethnic groups within Latinos and then also when we looked at elders we saw other um, interesting lack of differences across race and ethnicity in the social disadvantage and early onset um, these are it's just as important to identify the factors that are driving disparities as it is to also see what’s not driving disparities such as perhaps looking a little more closely at those findings for informal care and hopefully these ah, findings will guide policy makers and clinicians in their efforts to improve access to and quality of mental health care for racial/ethnic minorities. Thanks.

Intersection of Race, Ethnicity, Immigration, and Cultural Influence on the Nature and Distribution of Health and Mental Health James S.

Funding for the projects discussed in this talk provided by American Psychiatric Association. NIA, NIDA, OBSSR, NSF, and NIMH 

00:46:25
JAMES JACKSON Hi, I’m right in the middle with regard to ah, being either efficient in terms of technology or not so ah we'll see. So, I’ve a lot of things. I will run over some slides um because some of the points have been made already um, my talk actually fits in very neatly um, there are two surprising things I saw for the second talk of which maybe we'll get a chance to talk about at the, at the end during the discussion period. So, the point of my talk today is to make the point um that there is an intersection of race, ethnicity, immigration and cultural influences ah, on the way in which we understand our issues having to deal with both health and mental health. Um, I now expect to provide a lot of explanations but indeed I want to point to findings would indeed that will suggest. That this indeed is the right way to look at and to gain understandings of this particular issues. So, what we look at is something that we can RICE which refers to Race, Immigration, Culture and Ethnicity um, to the (inaudible ) of culture, age and SES which has impact with regard to the health of any particular given individual and in fact any particular given group that we might wanna take a look at. 

00:47:40
Demographic Transitions Growing Diversity of Population Need for intra-Group Studies Need for Inter-Group & Cross-National Studies Lack of Existing Knowledge Paradox of Mental Disorder in U.S. 

00:47:40
JAMES JACKSON Um, the fact is that we are in, interesting(ph) demographic transition. There is a growing diversity of the populations ah, there is a need for a more intra-group studies and I think the previous two speakers make this particular point. There is also a need for inter-group & cross-national studies as well in order to look at this kind of RICE model. There is a lack of existing knowledge and there is a paradox of Mental Disorder in United States which have already been pointed to and I’m gonna talk about today. 

00:48:10
Race Matters Even if we don’t know what “IT” is 

00:48:10
JAMES JACKSON So race does matter even if we don’t know what it is um, there is no doubt about that. There are a lot of people who're gonna talk about race (inaudible ) phenomena but indeed race does make a difference. 

00:48:21
Nature of Race in United States One Drop Rule Association with Intelligence and Character Real Discrimination in housing, schooling, occupation, and related areas of life 

00:48:25
JAMES JACKSON Nature of race in United States, the one drop rule particularly as we would look at the black population. It’s been associated with intelligence and character and in fact there is real discrimination. It’s just not in people's heads, trust me, ah in terms of housing, schooling, occupation, and related areas of life. 

00:48:40
However we construe race (ethnicity, etc) there are two processes operative Biological Social – Self & Other Far-fetched to think that biological process alone could account for observed group differences in health in U.S. as I have reviewed here Social processes must play a major role 

00:48:40
JAMES JACKSON So how do you think about race? Race actually is construed on two different aspects. One is a biological factor. Race does have a biological basis. I know lot of people don't like to hear that they want to talk about the social construction of race. Yes, race is socially constructed. But it is constructed on certain kinds of categories of skin color, of certain features, of hair type and so on. In fact, one of the things I usually talk about in this kind of group where I can say, people don’t like it but if give you um, 60 seconds to divide this room up into racial groups all of you could do that very easily and you can’t do it if you, you can do it because indeed we use um, observable sorts of indicators of race and that’s a very, very important issue. But both biological and social processes play a role with regard to how we understand things. This is a slide that I would like to show and the point is, is that the largest differences particularly in health, disparities in United States of America are between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. There is a reason for that. Um, these groups as I also like to say um, have perfectly colluded on one thing over the 400 year history of the United States and that’s who is black? Um, using the one drop rule that is a very important issue and both African-Americans and Non-Hispanic whites agree with who is black for totally different reasons. Whites want to be able to identify people as black to avoid them and blacks want to have the largest groups that they possibly can have. So, one of the questions that I think we don’t ask to ourselves enough about in the health or mental health field is what in the world does our identities have to do with regard to the disparities that we see? And just to make a fine point at this ah. No one does biological assessments when we do studies that look at big health differences or mental health differences. The most common way in which we understand people’s racial definitions is easier to ask them to indicate what their race or ethnicity is or we make an observation and we put them in those particular categories. So why in the world should my designation as an African-American mean that I belong to a group that is going to live eight year shorter than the group for which a person says that indeed they are white and in fact to make a little joke um, I’m now white ah, I didn’t know that before as of this moment forward. Whenever anybody ask me to mark any form with regard to what my race is, I’m white. So that means I’m gonna live eight years longer now than I was going to live a few seconds ago. So, no that, that’s not, that’s not the case at all. We now understand that very well. But what is it then about the identity. It’s because these two things are so much overlapping of course. Whether you say you are black or whether the other who is observing who says you are black. It puts you in this particular category and it then therefore leaves you open to stressful affects of discrimination and other kinds of effects which produce the kinds of difference that we see. 

00:51:50
Major Culprits For Producing Stressful Effects AND Risks for Psychopathology May be Chronic Environmental Stressors and Discrimination Discrimination and perceived racism as a class of stressor have been shown to have health and mental health effects among racial and ethnic minorities Discrimination operates in the context of social, political, economic, and cultural influences over the individual and group life-course Discrimination and perceived racism, as well as other non-race-related stressors tied to poor structural life conditions probably play a role in health and mental health processes, but the role is complex 

00:51:50
JAMES JACKSON So, it's not about your identity as being black that produces these differences in morbidity and mortality is the fact of being black opens you up for series of events and other things in your life, over the life course that produce these big differences that we observe in middle age and older ages. 

00:52:10
Law of Small Effects in Race Related Outcomes (Jackson, 2004) There is no one single factor that produces observed physical and mental health disparities in process and outcomes among race/ethnic groups in U.S. Group of small differences that accumulate over the life-course to produce observed differences in adulthood and older ages among different race/ethnic group 

00:52:10
JAMES JACKSON So, the law of small effects. This is very similar to a point that David just made. Ah, and this just makes the argument that there is not one single factor that produces the observed physical and mental health disparities that we see in the United States of America. In fact it's a group of small differences which actually accumulate over the life-course that indeed produce the differences that we see in adulthood and older ages. If I’d lot of time I could show you a lot of slides which would make the argument but there are very few disparities in early years between African-Americans and Whites but these disparities grow over the life course become very large in middle age and propel these big difference that we see toward the end of the life course. 

00:52:55
Fundamental Assumptions Focusing on population groups (ethnicity, race, gender, SES, etc,) in contrast to focusing on categorical disorders, requires attending to a broader array of interrelated and multi-disciplinary research perspectives. This is particularly true when the population group of interest has been the object of poor treatment and has, and does, suffer from sustained, systematic, environmental forms of discrimination. Disentangling the meaning of “good” psychological health and individual pathology is confounded by the existence of real group mobility barriers and biological, social, economic and psychological factors that affect individuals and families from gestation to death. 

00:52:55
JAMES JACKSON The fundamental assumptions and I will just make this very quick. When you focus on a population group ah, with regard to ethnicity or race whatever in contrast to focusing on categorical disorder means that you have to attend to a broader array of things than you do with regard to disorder. This is particularly true when the population group has been ah, the target of systematic environmental forms of discrimination. It makes us actually more difficult to understand what indeed are the differences that we observe. How you disentangle the notion of what is good psychological health in individual pathology is confounded by the existence of real group mobility barriers and biological, social, economic and psychological factors. It makes us our life much more difficult. As a scientist, I mean, let me try in the other way ah, as a black man in this society I can get very upset about discrimination and so on because of what it does to me. As a scientist, I get angry with regard to discrimination because it makes it very, very difficult to research which allows us to be able to get a handle on what are the independent variables which have the effects on the particular outcomes. Both those two things are true. In fact, this is my little bicycle notion and one of the things about, thinking about psychopathology is that we never directly observe psychopathology. Psychopathology is an unobserved latent variable for which we estimate as a function of observed symptoms either reports of others, therapists, family members and so on or self-reports that people make and these things therefore are under the control of the environment in these particular reports. And so what all of these particular areas which lead to this notion of unobserved psychopathology there could be area which creeps into our assessment and our understanding with regard to what this is. 

00:54:50
NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) (2001 - 2003) CIDI 1.0 developed from DIS and first available in 1990 Multiple iterations and revisions Development of CIDI 3.0 World Mental Health Survey Initiative and the launch of the CPES projects All probability samples of non-institutionalized adults living in conterminous US 

00:54:55
JAMES JACKSON So, we’ve talked about this particular study. I think David gave a real nice description of what it is all about um, this is a excellent set of studies for doing a lot of different work. 

00:55:00
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys Data Disorder assessed using DSM-IV criteria National Comorbidity Study – Replication (NCS-R) Sample representative of the U.S. Population 9,282 total sample National Survey of American Life (NSAL) 6,082 (3,570 African American , 1,621 Afro-Caribbean, and 891 non-Hispanic Whites) National Latino and Asian American Survey (NLAAS) 4,864(2,095 Asian and 2,554 Latino) 

00:55:05
JAMES JACKSON Um, the data uses DSM-IV criteria. Um, it’s a replication of the NCS. Those of you know anything about the 1990 study would know that the observation that Laura made with regard to the differences for Latinos was not true in 1990. In fact, it was just the opposite. Ah, it is a very, very interesting fact that whether this changed or not, maybe we can have time to talk about that. so, this gives you the description of the data set and all kind of good stuff. They're large and nationally representative and there are excellent samples and it was well executed and we did a great job. So, so trust me. Um so these are some of the race and ethnic groupings in the CPES that is already again then referred to and I just wanna make a couple of points about that in a large, ah, look at this. So this is ah, this is major depressive episode problems by race and ethnicity across all these particular groups and what is interesting about this is the large differences that exist ah, among those particular groups for example, um, Puerto Ricans who have the largest here ah, followed by non-Latino whites. This is something that Norah talked about and something we talk about all the time as being a kind of ah, kind of interesting observation that non-Hispanic whites have higher rates of disorders than do African-Americans. But what is interesting and what I’m gonna focusing on is the fact that within race groups indeed want to confine ethnic differences. So, a lot of our works has focused on the issue of the ? African-American and Afro-Caribbean population. As an example of a group which shares a race but is in terms of skin tone, other kinds of things but they do not share ethnicity. So they provide a very nice model for understanding what the independent sources of race and ethnicity may be on our observances with regard to health in psychopathology and this is the reason why we look at this. This is the issue with regard to the role of nativity and whether you are born or not and again focusing on Afro-Caribbean and African-Americans what’s interesting about this is that you see tremendous differences in this particular group that’s forge by whether they are native born or US born I mean, non-native born or US born. In terms of what those differences are more than almost three times as much with regard to that Afro-Caribbean population. This is a mean data got role for severity, for the severely impaired for 12-month MDE. Again you see very, very large differences among the particular groups. Again making the point that, that one size doesn't fit all you really had to understand something about the particular group in order to be able to be understand some of these particular outcomes. Same thing with regard to ah, those with severe symptoms. 

00:58:00
Example Ancestry, Timing and Age at Immigration Matter for Black Caribbean Mental Health 

00:58:00
JAMES JACKSON So, let me give you an example and I’ll try to give some examples as we go along. This is also relates to a point that Norah made. This is lifetime any particular disorder ah, this is the effect on the total which I talked about before where the rates for any disorder ah, are higher among whites than they are among African-Americans and Afro-Caribbean’s. But if you look at the Afro-Caribbean population um, um it’s very, very interesting um, in terms of what generation that you are in and I will show you both ancestry effects as well as timing of migration which has this (inaudible ) impact. So, those people who um, would like um, these are then second um and subsequent generation both are and the parents are US born and you could see that the rates are higher than any of the other groups ah… that are here, alright. So these are all first generation, this is second generation, this is third generation and subsequent generations. What is very important here is that there is a big difference between second and third generation Afro-Caribbeans and ah, you're gonna see this over and over again. So, those people who do research when they talk about second and beyond generations awfully collapse across a lot of variation in those particular populations which are very important. 

00:59:25
Could the lifetime disorders be a function of time in home country for Immigrant Caribbean Blacks? What about Age at Migration? 

00:59:25
JAMES JACKSON Could the lifetime disorders be a function of time in home country for Immigrant Caribbean Blacks? One way to look at this is to see whether we replicate what I just saw for twelve-month any disorder. Indeed, you get this particular effect. It doesn’t matter whether it's lifetime or it's last twelve months. The patterning of the effect is exactly the same. Age makes a big difference. Ah… And this is something that I think in the migration literature it really hasn’t been recognized. So, this is, this with people who are 55 years of age and older, it means that because of the timing of the study that they were 45 years of age or older when they migrated. So, this particular group is first generation Afro-Caribbean who are now 55 years of age and older. They were 45 or older when they migrated because it's 0-10 years, and look at the rates. Where is the first generation protection here? There is no first generation protection with regard to this particular set of individuals. And if you look at those who are 35 to 54, again you begin to see some peculiar kind of effects with regard to, to this. And in fact, one of the things that we're suggesting, is that the first generation, ah… the first generation protection and I, I had to give a lot number of paper to convince you with this. But, this research is leading us to, to raise the question whether first generation protection is actually breaking down. To the extent the first generation protection, ah… part of it is due to the ignorance of the people and I mean that in the most positive way, that is they don’t understand the particular culture that they come to, they are more likely therefore to say closer to, ah… to, to, to home in some particular sort of ways ah… they're ah… less likely to think of themselves as the part of that particular culture, that’s totally breaking down. Ah… You can learn all you want about American culture from MTV ah… if you live in Jamaica or if you live in Guyana or you live anywhere. So, we actually believe that first generation protection is breaking down. Ah… And it’s something that we’re gonna be looking at. Ah… This is Prevalence of Lifetime Substance Abuse by Demographics for the NSAL. Ah… Again I wanna make this particular point in this particular one. This is first generation Caribbean Blacks, second generation Caribbean Blacks, third generation of more Caribbean Blacks, African American are the contrast groups. What you see is no differences between African Americans and the third generation of ah… Afro-Caribbeans, but whopping differences between the second generation and the first. And in fact, affects the goal just in the opposite direction. So that first generation Caribbean Blacks are actually better off than the African Americans in second generation Caribbean Blacks are actually worse off than African Americans. Again, you have to be able to disentangle ancestry, race and ethnicity, in order to be able to understand these particular effects. Gender and ethnicity matter a lot. So that what we see is the fact that for African Americans, this is a traditional finding, ah… that females tend to be somewhat worse off ah… in terms of disorders, it's more true with regard to ah… ah… affective or depressive disorders. But if you look at Caribbean Blacks ah… born in the United States, this effect is actually not there, if anything nails or worse off. If you look at the ones who came between 11 ah… plus years ago, ah… you see that you get an opposite finding. If you take look at the people who came between ah… 0 and 10 years ago, you get this effect, which is very strong ah… for males to be much more soft than females, in terms of what the outcomes are, alright. So, gender matters, but in the context of ancestry, ah… nativity, ah… and so on. Ah… If you look at 12-month prevalence, indeed you see some of the same effects. It's not just something about the migration experience. Ah… This is anxiety disorders, which is somewhat different. Ah… Again females clearly overall for African Americans are almost twice as likely to have ah… this disorder than the males. But look at the reversals for Caribbean-born blacks, it's just the opposite. So if we take race, and you say that ah… females have higher rates than do black, than do black males, you'd get it wrong when you're referring to Caribbeans. This is just the point I'm trying to make in this slide. The same thing with regard to any mood disorder, it's same kind of effects, alright. Persistence only means that if we look at 12-month disorder within the context of having any lifetime disorder, ah… what happens with regard to those effects. Observe that African American females are at greater risk of being in this particular category than the males, but again you get reversals, these are all Caribbean black US born, ah… you have males who are at greater risk for the persistence of the disorders than do females. And there's not much difference with regard to the immigrant Caribbean groups, whatever the years that they've come to the United States. Ah… The same thing with regard to major depressive disorder same kind of effect. 

01:04:35
Summary Gender Differences in Onset of Disorders among Foreign-Born Caribbean Blacks by Immigration Status. Caribbean Black females who were not born in the U.S. were more likely than Caribbean Black males not born in the U.S. to have a disorder onset for PTSD (p01) and MDD (p0001) after immigration. No gender differences were found for other anxiety or mood disorders with regard to nativity. 

01:04:35
JAMES JACKSON So, gender differences are there, but the gender differences are there in the context of nativity, in the context of ancestry, in the context of timing of migration and so on. 

01:04:45
Summary Gender differences in psychopathology varied among African American and Caribbean Black adults, especially with regard to anxiety and mood disorders. Caribbean Black males appear to be at risk for specific anxiety and mood disorders more than Caribbean Black females. Caribbean Black males appear to be at risk for specific anxiety and mood disorders more than Caribbean Black females. Caribbean Black females appear to develop panic and major depressive disorders after moving to the U.S. Age of onset appears to be younger for Caribbean Black males and their risk higher for panic disorder, PTSD and MDD when compared to other ethnic-gender subgroups. MDD seems to persist for Caribbean Black males. The pattern of gender differences in psychiatric disorders were consistent with expectations among African Americans based on previous research. Differences in Service Use. 

01:04:45
Context Matters Detention and Incarceration Example 

01:04:50
JAMES JACKSON So, ah… if we look at context does matter. I wanna give some examples of another kind of context we can think about and let me give that the example with regard to incarceration. Ah… One of the things that's interesting about this is that ah… what we find for those adults in the household, if there are somebody in your family who's in jail, ah… that you find ah… they have a higher probability of having a disorder than those people who are different. 16.1% higher for substance disorder and 46% higher for any disorder. Ah… If you look at the detention status, ah… it's like ah… adults response relationship for African Americans, for substance disorders, ah… the more likely you are, if you're never arrested, never detained over your life course, 3.7% probability of being it. If you’ve been in jail or prison, 32.8% probability of being in it. And you see the same thing with regard to almost each of the groups, although we get a kind of nonlinearity here with regard to this particular finding. We have to disentangle that a little bit, but overall you're better off if you don’t go to prison, ah… in terms of whether you have a disorder or not, alright. Well, I’m just gonna bring a message, I mean, you know, well. Hahaha…The other thing we know, by the way this is just an aside. There are lot of crazy people in jail. You really don’t wanna be there. Ah… And in fact you get the same effect with regard to the number of times ah… that you've been in jail. Even you get the same effect for the number of months that indeed you spent time of jail. There is something about this incarcerating experience. Now this is cross-sectional data so we really can’t begin to disentangle it, but indeed there is something going on with this association that needs to be looked at. If you look at the ECA data, I just wanna make a point about the ECA data. 

01:06:30
Diagnostic Interview Schedule used Disorders assessed using DSM-III criteria Unlike CPES, all respondents were asked all symptom questions. Thus, unique opportunity to examine the expression and patterning of symptoms across and within demographic groups. 

01:06:35
JAMES JACKSON That… That the ECA data, ah… did not use DSM-IV criteria. The DSM-IV criteria says, you can’t really get into the CD specifications unless you meet one or the other ah… low mood or lack of interest, ah… that is you cannot be a case of major depression using DSM-IV unless you say yes to one of those two symptoms or both. That wasn’t true for the ECA. In the ECA, they ask questions about all symptoms. 

01:07:00
Ethnicity, Gender, and Nativity Influence Symptom Endorsement 

01:07:00
JAMES JACKSON So what’s important here is that ethnicity, gender and nativity, influence symptom endorsement. For people indeed who meet ah… the criteria for major, major depressive episodes, these are all the various different kinds of groups that were looked at in the ECA. And the only point I wanna make about this incredibly busy slide, is that indeed the patterning of the symptoms for people who meet criteria are very different, depending upon what particular group that you are in. So that if you are white, ah… ah… ah… for example, you see ah… a much higher predominance of death thoughts than you get for some of the other groups. On the other hand, if you are native American (inaudible ) native, fatigue plays a major role with regard to the reports on those people. So we're disaggregating those people who'd meet criteria in the DIS and we say what are the patterning of symptoms indeed that lead to that particular, ah… that particular diagnosis. And this is for women, and it's even more pronounced that what I showed you before in terms of what the different patterns are across the various different groups, that is what, the argument this makes may mean for us, is that what constitutes a major depressive episode in this case, maybe very different for the different groups and for the different gender groups, which may have real implications with regard to how we treat these things, how we understand it and so on. 

01:08:25
Correlates of Health and Disorders Differ by National Context An Example of an Approach to Health Disparities: International, Inter-and Intra-Ethnic in UK/US Comparisons 

01:08:30
JAMES JACKSON Ah… The correlates of health and disorders differ by national context. Ah… One of the things that we’ve doing is to not only think about disparities within the United States context, but once you think about the Afro-Caribbean population as being a model for understanding race and ethnicity, it demands almost that you indeed leave the shores of the United States. And why is that? It's because the Afro-Caribbean diaspora is very well defined. This makes them a great case again, because this is their diaspora. As an African descended group, they are in the Caribbean, they are in the UK, they are in the United States and they are in Canada and they are in few other places. But for the most part, this is where you find the Caribbean black population around the world. And the question is, what does national context have to do with regard to the experiences which this particular black group has? So, I’m gonna give you one example. And I’m gonna rush with some things not because these are important and critically vital slides that I would like to share with you, but I’m just trying to get to the major points, okay. So, this just says as the period of migration from the Caribbean what was interesting about this is when the UK turned off immigration, ah… the United States actually picked up immigration, that’s all, that’s all, that’s all you gotto to know about that. Ah… Generation, socioeconomic position and experiences of racism differ. Those Caribbeans in the UK report more racist experiences than the Caribbeans who live in the United States. Ah… Income, ah… if you look at in fair or poor/bad health, again the Caribbean English worse off than the Caribbeans who are in the United States. The same thing with regard to discrimination reports and bad health. Ah… If you look at what explains the differences, ah… which we've been trying to understand. Ah… What you find is that the differences between the Caribbean English ah… with, against white Americans, as you can see that the ah… rates of bad or poor health are, starts off at about two-and-a-half times greater. We've put all kinds of controls against this, and believe me you never get rid of differences that we observed, alright. Ah… If you look at the difference between Caribbeans in the United States and also ah… if you look at the United, ah… while we get rid of a lot other differences between these groups. We never with all the adjustments I showed you before, eliminate the differences between what goes on for Caribbeans in England and what goes on for Caribbeans in the United States. 

01:11:00
Conclusion: US-UK-Canada-Caribbean Comparisons Difference Between Black(Caribbean) Populations With Different Histories and in Different Locations. Significance of Social Economic Effects In part Human Capital, Possible Selection Effects? In Part(Blocked) Opportunity Effects? Significance of Period of Migration Effects For example, Was There a Window of Opportunity in the US(Post-Civil Rights)?Importance of Placing Inquiries in the Immediate and Historical Social Context Within Which Ethnic Groups Explore and Re-Form. 

01:11:05
JAMES JACKSON So there are real differences between these groups. Ah… They have different experiences, different histories and so on and you really have to understand all of this if you are gonna understand these particular differences. Ah… We’ve been doing a lot of studies now, ah… particularly we went to Guyana and Jamaica, had a lot of happy research assistance, because they gotta go to Guyana and Jamaica and collect data. I was a popular PR the other way. Ah… But there are differences between all these groups. And I’m just gonna show you some of the differences ah… that exist in understanding this. Remember, one of the problems with regard to doing migration studies, immigration studies, is that you always have a selection factor. The people who leave a particular place are going to be different than the people who stay. How we disentangle that is always very problematic. But this is the people who have, ah… meet criteria for depression for mania, for substance abuse as example. He is a US-born Caribbean, foreign-born Caribbean in the United States, Guyanese and Jamaicans. And you notice that the foreign-born Caribbeans have much lower rates, almost for everyone of these particular ah… screening in than any of the particular groups there. In fact, although I've argued against this thesis for 40 years, the selection up offices, all the data are leaning toward selection as being a very important element in understanding migration differences. Ah… And you see the same thing with regard to looking at the substance abuse, MDE and so on that indeed selection factors may indeed be going on. I'm trying to hurry through this because, ah… I have a lot to show you. Anyway, the whole main point to make about all these particular differences is that there are differences between, ah… Caribbeans who live in the Caribbean, Caribbeans who migrated to the United States and Caribbean who are ancestry group in the United States. 

01:12:50
Conclusions Serious physical and mental health problems manifest in different ways among racial and ethnic groups in the united states Black ethnicity is an important source of these differences. Among Afro-Caribbeans, immigrant and ancestry status make important differences. First generation health protection is not an adequate explanation for differences among Afro-Caribbeans, whites and African Americans Mental health disparities are not reducible in any simplistic way to differences in social and economic statuses among groups. Complex, multi-faceted, and life-course influenced. 

01:12:50
JAMES JACKSON So, serious physical and mental health problems manifest in different ways among racial and ethnic groups. Black ethnicity is an important source of these differences. Among Afro-Caribbeans, immigrant and ancestry status make important differences. First generation health protection, I do not believe is an adequate explanation and mental health disparities are not reducible in any simplistic way the differences and social and economic status among groups. 

01:13:15
General Summary Disparities in physical health statuses, and services among different racial and ethnic groups do exist, but we do not know exactly why Disparities in mental disorders among racial and ethnic groups are more complex than those related to physical health and we do not know exactly why Discrimination and perceived racism have been shown to have health effects. Growing evidence argues against simplistic genetic determinism in complex disease differences among racial and ethnic groups. Discrimination and perceived racism probably play a role in health and services processes but the role is complex More research in needed on how discrimination and perceived racism are similar to and the same as other potential life stressors. And how the stress process itself may be implicated in the nature of gene expression Physical health and health service disparities are not reducible to, for example, simple SES or genetic explanations Complex, multi-faceted (e.g. culturally, racially, ethnically, migration, etc.) and life-course influenced And In Conclusion The health differentials by race and ethnicity are not easy to understand. Why should self-reported race be related to physical and mental health outcomes? Pathways for how “self” and “other conceptions of race affect health outcomes is potentially explicable. New bio-behavioral studies are needed that take a more complex view of gene x gene and gene x environment interactions. Greater attention needs to be paid to understanding “environment” in any evolutionary, genetic, and bio-behavioral view of complex human behaviors and diseases. 

01:13:15
JAMES JACKSON So we see these differences. So I’m gonna get to the, really to the end ah… of this. See that, all that stuff there as it says, you know these papers are important, we need to do better research, greater attention needs to be paid to understanding the environment and how it works in some particular sort way, and I have zero minutes left.

01:14:00
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Okay, this is why we liked to bring our panelists up to the front, ah… so they can be prepared to answer your questions. We have microphones set-up, as we did yesterday. So, if you have questions please come to the microphone and ask them. We have a good amount of time to cover with the vast ground that our panelists discussed. And I’m going to summarize just a couple of the themes that I heard ah… from today’s plenary and in just a couple of minutes as you start to mandate(ph) on your questions. Ah… I feel as though our panelists all emphasized ah… in each of their ah… different presentations that obviously race, ethnicity and culture are important in matter, but perhaps even more so they matter in the context of immigration, gender, age and nativity. There were some expected differences that they shared with us and some unexpected. Ah… Some of the expected ah… kinds of things that they showed us were ah… that financial stress, for financially-stressed individuals there are higher rates of mental health diagnosis among women. You know, this is all groups. Ah… Some of their expected findings were that service use is quite significantly ah… decreased for ethnic minority groups. That’s something that we've known and also we saw that among women, particularly African American woman they show have… they have worse mental health in African American men. That maps on very nicely to what we know sort of in general. But there were several very interesting unexpected differences that our panelists showed as well. Ah… And that in fact with financially stressed individuals immigrant men have higher rates of any disorder, affective disorders and anxiety disorders. Another interesting difference was shown with, ah… among Latinos that Mexican seemed to be showing better mental health and are driving the so called Hispanic Paradox versus Puerto Ricans, who in particular have worse mental health and other Latinos and worse than white Americans. And then interestingly enough Latino elders seemed to have worse mental health. Another interesting ah… difference, unexpected difference is that stigma does not seem to be a barrier for receiving mental health ah… services among immigrant ah… Latinos. And the other sort of interesting, maybe unexpected difference depending on your vantage point is that the longer, the longer you are in the United States the worse you look, in terms of mental health. Ah… So, some of those as expected and some of those are unexpected. There are also very interesting generational differences for mental health between US-born men who look worse in terms of mental health disorders than women and in terms of gender. Ah… The symptom differences that we just saw from James Jackson, that there is a different picture for me to depressive disorder across all groups. Definitely maps on to clinical work that I did many, many, many years ago in San Francisco, where I was doing ah… depression groups of the African American women, and they, their, their picture of depression actually did look different. They reported things like ah… less of a sad, withdrawn affect and more of an irritable affect, ah… hypersomnia instead insomnia, weight gain rather than weigh loss. And there in particular the symptom of guilt didn’t seem to be present. When we asked people, do you feel like you’re letting people down or you know in terms of ah… you know, just that interpersonal guilt that you find often with depression? Many of the African American women of our group would say, everybody else is letting me, I’m taking care of these people and then I, you know, taking care helping me at all. So, it looks very interesting. Ah… Finally, the last thing I'll say that's something that I’ve been interested in quite a long time and that is the paradox that Dr. Jackson referred to, ah… at the beginning of his ah… talk where we know and we've known for a long time now that there are fairly significant racial disparities and physical health problems across almost every indicator of physical health. And one of the things that jumps out at me every time I see the findings from the CPR studies, is how ethnocultural groups in this ah… country tend to have better mental health. Latinos and blacks from several mental health diagnosis disorders on these National Prevalence Surveys look better than do white Americans. And that’s a sort of uncovered and unexpected perhaps cultural ethnic racial strength that I think has been understudied. And so I'd be curious to know from the panelists, their thoughts about that, but I'd like to open it up to the audience for questions, and I see we have one from Dr. Herd(ph). 

01:18:10
[sil.] 

01:18:15
We just… We just can’t see you. 

01:18:20
DR. HERD (ph) Kind of, yes, okay. So, I just had a question, I guess for everyone on the panel about the ways that we’re understanding mental health, ah… so we’re using, it sounds like DSM-IV symptoms, ah… symptom criteria to make these assessments and I’m wondering about specially you might have some of the conflicting findings around nativity and ah… immigration status. What your thoughts are in terms of how or even assessing, like your are seeing differences and symptoms, but again this is very like Western notion, ah… for example depression or other mental health issues, so in some ways it almost feels like maybe we're imposing that’s ah… Western bias on them. I'm wondering what your thoughts are in terms of if there's other ways to assess for how these different kind of cultural backgrounds ah… and experiences might influence, how people understand mental health and illness for example? 

01:19:15
[sil.] 

01:19:25
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI I think you've raised ah… an important issue ah… both in terms of ethnic cultural differences in looking at symptoms versus, ah… perfect, and then James actually doesn't need a microphone, but I do. Hahaha… 

01:19:45
Hahaha… 

01:19:45
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Ah… And the tension between ah… symptoms and disorders, ah… one of the interesting findings, I think across most racial ethnic groups is that ah… racial minority groups is that, ah… they often score higher at higher means on symptom scales and tend to have a lower prevalence different mental disorders. And there is a tension about what that actually means whether measuring different things, when we use symptoms scales versus kind of a dichotomous disorder or whether we're capturing just the different kind of ah… experience with these kinds of measures. I think, ah… one of the areas especially for Asians that we haven't done much on, is to look at the kinds of symptoms and problems that manifest in ah… Asian countries, and to, to see how those kinds of experiences might manifest in the US, to kind of get a better sense of the, the kinds of problems that maybe meaningful in ah… the countries where immigrants come from. I just wanna mention one quick context ah… thing that I didn’t mention, which James and Norah ah… to touch upon, then I'll turn it over to them, is that for Asian Americans while the rates in general are, ah… seem lower, they are actually higher in the US than it is in most studies done in Asian countries. Ah… Racial depression really low in ah… many Asian countries including Hong Kong, ah… Taiwan and China and Asian Americans generally about two to three times more in the rates. So there is something to either the selection or the experience and how we express ah… different kinds of depressive symptoms in ah… the US, so. 

01:21:45
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY I guess the only thing I would add is that it is of interest to me I really appreciate the question, how much of the… the what we see in terms of the nativity differences has to do also with learning the language of disorder over generations? So it’s a difficult thing to pull apart how much of the connection between sort of level(ph) for a symptom and the symptom itself. So… some of the work that we are doing in our centre right now, I think I make a plug(ph) for some qualitative research around these areas just because we are looking at people with you know history of treatment and not history of treatment and looking at how they describe symptomatology both people who have been born in the US and who have not and things likes like, like you know this is a complex and difficult area to understand but something I think that… that deserves further attention. 

01:22:45
JAMES JACKSON So… I agree with both those things as so I showed you the different content of the symptoms for ah… different groups who meet criteria for disorder, which you can do in the ECA its much more difficult to do in the CD. Because in the CD you already have a very-very interesting group. It’s… It’s probably a mistake. It’s probably a DSM-IV, is a mistake on that on that particular end. These data would suggest from ECA’s strongly that it is because of (inaudible ) support. So those you know some work that I’m doing particular recent work (inaudible ). I could have given a much more controversial talk ah… much-much more controversial. Because our argument is that ah…ah… our argument is that blacks in this society by their good rates of mental health, by selling out their physical health and we have a model and a framework article just came out American General Public Health last month which lays out the argument and shows (inaudible ) datas to support this. And the… there is no reason necessarily. It’s… It’s very true that African American show more symptomatology particularly around depressive symptoms and affective disorder symptoms than do non-Hispanic whites that’s a fact. Our argument is that that is an indicator of the greater stress upon which the African American population lives in this particular society. But it may or may not be necessarily related to the disorder. So we argue actually that disorder is not necessarily (inaudible ) function all of the symptoms and in fact those data which I showed you earlier should make that particular argument and that having a disorder is a fundamental change in the organisms brain. Ah… in that you cannot go from symptom (inaudible ) to disorders, indeed we need to try to do that and what symptoms do, particularly symptoms for stress, it signals to African Americans that they need to do something about the stress (inaudible ) living. And unfortunately ah… there are large… really wonderful set of things that people can do to (inaudible ). They can smoke. They can drink. They can overeat. They can use drugs. They can use all kinds of things to reduce the stress. And believe it or not all those things are psychologically stress reductive. The only problem with all those things is that they are killing, that’s what’s wrong with it. And you can only do this for so long in terms of doing these particular kinds of things and in some points it breaks down. So that’s my more controversial talk on this, it tries to explain the lower rates. Now one of the things I mentioned is the fact in 1980, we reported that for all the disorders, (inaudible ) that Latinos have higher rates than Non-Hispanic Whites. Some of you may be familiar with the 1990 I should say in the ESC. So it’s very-very interesting to see today that indeed these things would be going in the other direction, I am not sure what that means in this particular point. Even then African Americans had lower rates, African Americans had lower rates in the ECA and they have lower rates now. I don’t know why that… that shift has occurred, if its occurred, if the shift. 

01:26:05
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY One important point is that the language of interview was English only right for the NCSR(ph) so I think that enabling to bring in the Spanish-speaking Latinos, both presence are more complicated, but also probably a fuller picture of what’s really happening. 

01:26:25
JAMES JACKSON We’ll have to look at that because the… the (inaudible ) replete from 1944 with regard to making the argument that… that… that Hispanics have higher rates. But you probably right, it’s probably something to do with that. I’m sorry we… we didn’t mean start talking to each other. 

01:26:40
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY Huh…huh… 

01:26:40
LAURA KOHN-WOOD That’s okay. I… I am just gonna answer (inaudible ) Dr. Griffin has a question in that as I’m glad to mentioned you are mortgaging hypothesis and I am glad to see that you (inaudible ). I have heard you talk about it before and that is that as blacks (inaudible ) our mental health, there are physical health habits. As someone who is trying to move from in my current role from a clinical psychologist to a community psychologist. I prefer to look at the positive or the glass half full and that is that due to a history of denigration(ph) we developed, specific coping strategies perhaps like group affiliation, racial identity and what I call deflective coping, religious and spiritual coping that allows us to survive and not only survive but thrive despite the social disadvantage that we experience. 

01:27:20
JAMES JACKSON A lot of people like that hypothesis because it’s so hopeful and… and every time I give all these talks there is always a minister who stands up and says what about prayer ah… and I’ll say the same thing prayer is good, social support is good, having high and positive identity is good, all those things are good. They are just not efficient. They are non-efficient methods by which you can front distressing your life. Believe it or not the path of physiological pathways by which we will do stress is much more efficient they have a drink, is much more efficient to smoke, is much more efficient to drink, is much more efficient to overeat, in terms of reducing the stress. Sometimes social support works, sometimes prayer works, sometimes having high identity works, sometimes they work. Those are the things work all the time. They work all the time and they worked well and they become well learned kinds of ways which we deal with it. There is no accident why African American woman have rates of 60 to 70% obesity ah… by the fifth and sixth decade of life and that’s because overeating is an incredibly efficient way which you can deal with a kind of stressors in your particular life. And why you should learn that particular response in the presence of stress following that all these psychologists and audience will understand that, you’re turned to it again and you will turn to it again, it become self reinforcing and it works very well. And that’s really not to say that the other things that Laura mentioned are not things that are effective, but if you look at the literature, what you’ll find for social support for example, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. What you find for identity, sometimes it buffers in one direction, sometimes it buffers in the other direction. What you find for prayer, sometimes it works, sometime it doesn’t work. What you find for smoking, drinking, eating and so on it works every time, it works every time and that’s because there is a clear pathway by which it has it effects, that’s the (inaudible ). 

01:29:21
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI And this has been brought to you by (inaudible ). 

01:29:25
LAURA KOHN-WOOD And let me add to that just before I left Michigan… 

01:29:25
JAMES JACKSON That was cool cigarette. 

01:29:30
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Just before I left Michigan I… I (inaudible ) talk by our researcher, substance (inaudible )researcher from (inaudible ) Nancy Boyd who talked about the highest consumers of a glass of wine plus every night would be… 

01:29:40
JAMES JACKSON A glass of wine. 

01:29:40
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Who… Who is the highest consumer of having a glass of wine or more every night do you think? 

01:29:45
JAMES JACKSON Like(ph) academics. 

01:29:45
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Academics… yeah academics, professors anyway. 

01:29:50
JAMES JACKSON No… no… I… I… I really believe that to be true. 

01:29:50
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Like you I just wanna to add one thing that in support of that is it helps to explain why you have a a paradox in the association between, you have a paradox in the association between SES(ph) and obesity for High SES(ph) African-American especially high SCS African-American women that they actually have high rates of obesity when a case that moving up to ladder may not actually reduce the kinds of stress. They encounter in fact to me actually increase it. 

01:30:25
LAURA KOHN-WOOD That’s because there is no man up there with you. 

01:30:30
JAMES JACKSON No, no, no. We have… We have… We have data which really clearly shows that if you… if you segregate the population of African-American women by low, medium and high SCS, it doesn’t affect the rates of obesity and it’s really… it’s just one of those another interesting factors it should. It should really have some effects but it is really interesting it does not moderated as much as you want to have. It makes a support for this particular argument. 

01:30:55
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Yeah we are going to have academic panel and comedy statement. 

01:31:00
JAMES JACKSON Absolutely, absolutely. 

01:31:00
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Dr. Griffin. 

01:31:05
DR. GRIFFIN It’s actually said the way pretty nice to meet you. One of the two very professional that I had and first question what is I am pretty interested in… in buffers between the stress and negative outcome linked with whether that be mental health or physical health and I am wondering if there is kind of different moderators or different buffers operate differently for this different intersectional groups. So, for example I know that education is supposed to before all of these benefits and financial benefits often it does but that progression we if there is difference (inaudible ) race so what sort of (inaudible ) less privileged given high education (inaudible ). So I am wondering if you can speak to whether that present (inaudible ) know that buffers this relationship between stress and physical health or mental health operate differently for these different groups and then the second question was, do you have for the Latino, and last(ph) whether there are any variable then for (inaudible ) legal status and I know it is a touching subject but obviously a stressor and I just wondering (inaudible how any of the relationship that (inaudible ) may be different and they are not on that status that's all. Thank you. 

01:32:21
JAMES JACKSON Well, Let me speak to the NSAL. So in the 1980 National Survey of Black Americans which this study was based upon, we required citizenship and in the NSAL we did not. On the other hand, we want to find out something about the citizenship status. So, we actually pretested a way of trying to look at that, I am not sure what NLAAS did but we asked people to do… we have a question of we ask people where are you if you are not born in United States, where are you with regard to the process of getting your green card? It was a very interesting question and then people could be at very different places like I am going to get it tomorrow. I just went down to your office yesterday and we have a whole set of questions. The argument will be probabilistically is that the people who say they don’t have it and they’ve just starting to get it or probably not or probably undocumented. And… in fact some of the analysis we do not looking at this variable we suggests indeed that is the case. So that's the possibility. It is a very-very difficult question to ask in a survey question. But we felt pretty good about this one. I don’t know what (inaudible ). Do you know? 

01:33:35
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI No we didn’t asked. 

01:33:35
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY No we didn’t asked. 

01:33:35
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI We do have a… 

01:33:40
JAMES JACKSON You take your microphone. 

01:33:40
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Yeah. I would. So its James Jackson okay. One of the things we did, did include in the study is set of questions around or set of responses around the culture distress that’s sort of get at the hassles they may encounter around the (inaudible ) status so that’s kind of another way of getting at the stressor. In terms of things that buffer that may not have turned out the way we expected I think for… you can… for the immigrant by gender interaction that is all often an interesting one for the Asian sample. You can either say that the men or the anomaly because they tend, immigrant men because they tend to have higher rates on most of the problems in the immigrant women or you can say that the immigrant women are the anomaly and we are not sure which direction to go on. But for the immigrant men the social support kinds of variables did not seem to operate in a direction we had expected. Social support for immigrant men didn’t have that kind of protective effect that we would suspect a lot of the negative facets of social relationships are really much more striking for immigrant men. In fact it was also the most striking for immigrant women. It just did not have a great impact for women as it did for men. 

01:35:20
JAMES JACKSON It’s a very complicated question that you’ve asked. For example, African-Americans one of the things that has happened over last 30 years is that there is a growing division between upper and middle class African-Americans and lower class African-Americans. Upper and middle class African-Americans are coming more and more in direct contact with whites in the work place, in the neighborhoods and places where they live, which is not true for African-Americans of lower education and lower income. And of course, one of the prerequisites for facing interpersonal discrimination is that you have to come in contact with the people who are discriminated against you. At so that’s one of the problems as to why higher social economic status may not indeed buffer the effects of what goes on with your environment for lower class African-Americans that without any lower income, lower education. We don’t forced to face interpersonal discrimination but they face more mean spirited kinds of circumstances from their everyday living and so on. As to why you see these particular effects. But the point is that it’s a complicated kind of relationship and with these kinds of datasets we (inaudible ). 

01:36:35
NORAH MULVANEY-DAY I just want yeah. I can just underscore the complexity of it. There is… we do have a paper looking across Latino subgroups, looking at… you know, family support, social support, and what’s called family cultural stress, so generational stress and the picture, I can't remember the details but the picture is that the different Latino subgroups look very different according to which… which one buffers stress and we did use a symptom scale for that one and then in addition there is sort of intercultural stress variable, is actually really predictive that intergenerational stress is not a buffer but it works in the other direction. So, we have done a little bit of work on those buffers and again a very complex picture with some also relationships going in the direction that we weren’t expecting. 

01:37:25
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI I would just say at one thing and that is that for all these status that what it does allow us to do is to look more seriously at number of past relationships that have been assumed but not really tested in these kinds of samples, and I would just point out for example, SCS and mental disorders (inaudible ), great product of University of Michigan. Just did a… Just did a paper with James, Maggie, and myself looking at the SCS mental health disorder seems to have a strong relationship for whites and it does for African-Americans, Asians, or Latinos, saving that kind of assumed SCS kind of pattern doesn’t necessarily show the kind of consistencies as it does for whites compared to other racial minor(ph) populations. 

01:38:20
JAMES JACKSON (inaudible ) indicate that the ancestry effect is really very (inaudible ) Afro-Caribbean and a lot of people who like to explain that (inaudible ) but the fact is that third generation Afro-Caribbean’s are very-very different to second generation Afro-Caribbean’s, not only the fact that they are second and third generation but the fact is when the grandparents and the great grandparents of what is now third generations Caribbean’s came to the United Status, there was not very much that they could do for their particular offspring. Second generation Afro-Caribbean’s benefited greatly from the Civil Rights revolution and their parents who came here as immigrants were able to do tremendous things for the second generation group and that’s one of the reasons why we see these big differences between the third generation young Afro-Caribbean’s in second generation of Afro-Caribbean’s. So you have to understand something about the nature of the movement but the Afro-Caribbeans who came here in 30s or 40s, in 50s caught hell(ph) not only they were black but they were also funny speaking black. So they were not welcomed either in the African-American population nor the white population. It’s one of the reasons why you see the parents today that Afro-Caribbean’s and Afro-Americans actually don’t share the same space. They did not live in the same neighborhoods. They (inaudible ) in the same areas but this is really has to do with regard to the historical facts of what went on in the 30s, 40s, 50s and you have to understand that if you are going to understand anything that we observed with regard to ancestry back today, just to make an example. 

01:40:00
LAURA KOHN-WOOD We have a question from our guest from Portland and then another one from audience. I'm sorry I don't remember your name even though we met yesterday. 

01:40:05
Oh! no that's fine. Sorry ah, maybe I can link your py(ph) hypothesis to my question, which is over reading you're still lucid, right. Other things you are not lucid and one thing that's missing from all of this that I encounter a lot with my students is what about the caregivers are once who have to keep it together because someone is diagnosable, but untreated in their family. In my case, my best friend Japanese-American, mother Alzheimer's, eldest son schizophrenic never cared for. The schizophrenia was never treated. Alzheimer she got her into treatment. (inaudible ) is good. Ah, so what does your system, what does your methodology say about the undiagnosed but stressed caregiver and then race ethnicity mental status and then also I have students who come to me for help and they have an undocumented family member, who needs mental health services and they will not go for help. So throw that out there. 

01:41:15
JAMES JACKSON Well, you know, we're really big on the stress process that's being the beyond our line of… of what we observed in a whole bunch and(ph) different kind of outcomes and ah, we often times look at the differences between both race related and non-race related stress. What we find for African-Americans let me just speak to that group right now. Is that stress source ah, that they are non-race related. African-Americans have the same range of buffers as do not as many whites and they're equally effective. So things like prayer, things like social support all these kinds of things work effectively for non-race related stressors and you get the same effects. When you get to the race related stressors is when these things began to break down and you find that African-Americans really don't have a very good set out of stress reductive mechanisms that really worked to reduce the effects of stress. So our argument would be, for people who face stressors both race related and race um, race-related and non-race related stressors is that is the amount of stress significant of the lives will lead them to act and behave in certain ways to try to reduce that stress and those things are not necessarily good for them. But the… the culprit here are the kinds of environmental circumstances ah, whether their personal circumstances of life or the circumstances of where people live or other kinds which is the real culprit here. You have to have a public health approach to understanding what goes on. Any kind of interpersonal dynamic kind of way of viewing this is not useful. You know, this is about the kind of environmental factors that people falling in this, and by the way we have a new paper which is coming out you know it's not out here coz it coming out, which shows that I do a paper on this, when does ah, when does non-race effects masquerade this race. Because the effects I've been talking about are not race effects at all. They have to be with regard to the nature of the ways in which people lives pause as (inaudible ) and I'm finished. 

01:43:26
LAURA KOHN-WOOD We have, we have two more questions from the audience here. 

01:43:30
Yeah and we are not weeping… 

01:43:35
JAMES JACKSON We just kinda see you… 

01:43:35
DR. DAVID TAKEUCHI That the light is blinding… 

01:43:35
LAURA KOHN-WOOD That's not a stop. Yeah, that's a go… that is a go. No, you go ahead. 

01:43:45
Ah, I have a question relating to mention the efficient(ph) behaviors that are not good for African-Americans. And there's a lot of research that shows that stress results in permanent way of changes as well as physiological changes and so, I'm wondering what you think about that fact, can you give some of these efficient(ph) behaviors is that so much a behavior whether it's smoking or drinking or over eating, but ran out of break down in physiological system, which we need to and think that behavior ah, such as over eating or drinking. 

01:44:30
JAMES JACKSON Yeah, Umm… 

01:44:30
Coz it's like where the… 

01:44:30
JAMES JACKSON No, that's the argument. In fact, we… we make the argument that the… there is a clear pathway through BHB access and related hormonal systems for which it has its effects and it's… this is the cultural theory too. So one of the interesting facts is that African-American women, in fact African-American women one of the few disparities that you'll ever see in earlier year is that obviously whites. That it actually starts early in childhood and accelerates over the life course. African-American men is not true at all. In fact, for African-American men smoking rates were low in early years, drinking rates were low, alcohol use all of rates of these kinds things were low. Was high among African-American men earlier in life is exercise and heavy involvement with regard to sports and other kinds of things. What happens to African-American men and so therefore this is a social cultural theory as well. So African-American men and by the way the heavy exercise in the other kinds of things have the same effects is over eating as drugs and everything. They… they've felt exactly to the same thing. So I use to make this argument what happens to African-American men in middle age. What happens to the African-American men in middle age is that the knees go out, or the legs go out. They cannot play basketball. If you look at the epidemiological literature it's fascinating. You gotta… in the middle age, African-Amerian men in 40s you get it optic, smoking. The whites(ph) then begins the fast whites(ph) optic in drinking, optic in the use of marijuana and other kinds of illegal drugs and so on. If even their obesity rates begin to go up and smoking rates increases. But before that they're not there at all. For African-American women the same thing is not true at all. It is not true is because of they've a very efficient culturally acceptable way in which they deal with stress in their lives. They do not have to switch, don't have to switch. You can just keep with it and we believe that this is the basis for thinking about addiction as well and why you observe this because addictive behavior is nothing more than in this particular situation is that you have a self-reinforcing system of behaviors of things that you do and this is self-reinforcing. Now, what we do find is that in later years in life all mechanisms for dealing with stress were out. It doesn't matter what it is. And for African-American you get it optic and depressive disorders late in life for not Hispanic whites it actually goes down but for African-American it actually goes up. It's a very. So, I think the epidemiologic literature is consistent with this particular theoretical view. Is this theoretical view right, I do not know. We're driving above(ph) this is form. We do want a study right now which is underway which argues that if you have a heart attack and you referred for (inaudible ) theory you referred to rehab if you do what the physician tells you to do stop smoking, stop drinking, stop over eating you will be a case of anti-depression by the end of the year. On the other hand, if you stop and don't follow the physician's recommendation you won't and that's why you get 40 and 60 and 70% drop off rates from cardiac rehab either when they are paid for. Because people are not gonna follow that because they are using these particular things in a stress (inaudible ) manner. These things that we talk about drinking, smoking, over eating, and so on these are not personal choices or indicators of weakness of character with regard to the individuals. They are actually very effective ways that which people used to cope with the stresses in their life. It's a very different view of thinking about these things. And if you think about it in this way it leads to a deriving certain kinds of predictions that then become empirically testable. So, if we that effect it will really be interesting. We have another study which is going on, which says if I intervene I can keep people in, in fact we're using mindful meditation as the intervention technique and our argument is that for people who'd get mind for meditation, who are leaving on the stress will not drop out of rehab instead will continue on rehab and of course will get the benefits out. So those are kinds of things we are doing but this leads to a testable hypothesis which you can look at. 

01:49:15
LAURA KOHN-WOOD Okay, we have one last question and then I will ask the audience to remain while Dr. Sellers addresses us briefly. 

01:49:25
LISA REY THOMAS Hi, thank you name is Lisa Rey Thomas, and I'm a research scientist at the alcohol and drug abuse institute at the University of Washington. Do you need your sunglasses? 

01:49:30
JAMES JACKSON No, no, you have a (inaudible ) behind your head. 

01:49:36
LISA REY THOMAS Okay, good and I just want to thank you for these really important and very interesting presentations about how important is to look at mental health status because just be in a one racial category or one ethnicity doesn't… doesn't tell the whole story. My question and I also want to thank you for putting up a couple of slides that and reflects some data on American and Alaskan native people. I'm a native investigator, I do my work with mental health and behavioral health with tribes and I am wondering where data is in these studies with regards to American and Alaskan native people. 

01:50:25
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Ah… I believe (inaudible ) some has conducted a number of epidemiological studies more in terms of specific communities and reservations. It's been difficult for him to garner or to conceptualize kind of a national study on native Americans, because like just the difficulties in tribal relationships as well as getting access to these communities. But he's, he's published a number of… are you familiar with his work you probably seen in it. 

01:51:00
LISA REY THOMAS Yes, sorry I probably didn't ask my question. I am taking about specifically in the work that you are presenting here talking about and the intersection of race ethnicity immigration and cultural influence or so in your studies here. I'm familiar with literature that exists so in these studies that you are presenting today. 

01:51:15
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Yeah, I'd, we did not have a native sample NCSR might have but it's a pretty small sample that I'm not sure if you could do much analysis in terms of the race. But I don't think any of our studies included American-Indian samples. 

01:51:35
JAMES JACKSON It is hard to do study on, on, on natives without really having a more focus way in which you look at it. The distributions are problematic. The identification of particularly those who live in urban areas ah… also creates other kinds of problems. So that these kind of national studies even this one which had 22,000 people when it was all put together is going to have very few ah… very few individuals and it certainly won't be represented. So one has to be very-very careful about what one says. The ECA I'll study… which I reported on which had a native included a native population even that group was relatively small and I would worry about what that what those findings mean. 

01:52:20
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Yeah and just some anecdote of things to some discrepancy, because I looked at some of the data in the ECA and there is some discrepancy as to how that group has defined, I think they included some east Asian-Indians, I think. 

01:52:35
[sil.] 

01:52:40
LISA REY THOMAS So… so thank you I guess then I just would follow-up with a point that I think it's really important that we acknowledges when representing our… our data because the the tribes and the communities that I work with are looking for data and are dependent on data to serve their communities and also for funding so. I think acknowledging that there is a lack of data and there is a lack of… of reportable data in the studies is important so I appreciate that. 

01:53:05
DAVID T. TAKEUCHI Good. Thank you. 

01:53:05
LAURA KOHN-WOOD And a fruitful, unexplored area for you are the next ramp(ph), right. Okay thank you so much please join me in thanking our panel for their insights. 

01:53:20
[sil.] 

01:53:25
LAURA KOHN-WOOD And Dr. Sellers is gonna address us briefly before we go on to have our necessary stress relate (inaudible ) glass of wine. 

01:53:35
DR. ROBERT SELLERS Ha ha ha… so… ah… we have come to the point where we are almost at the end of ah… the official activities of the conference. We have one more set of activities, which Laura had mentioned and James that food ah… and so I'll think of eating now in the context of any other drug that is helpful for a particular set of outcomes but has side effects that perhaps can kill you. So I guess there is no difference in Zestril or any other form of drug that were treated. But to wrap this up, I just wanted to make sure I had the opportunity and we've acknowledged the group before but I want to make a public and personal ah… ah… thank you to all of the folks that have worked to make this possible. In particular, the planning committee, the volunteers, ah… but also and most importantly to you the presenters and participants because without you ah… this would have been a very interesting but strange kind of event. So please give yourselves a hand. 

01:55:00
[sil.] 

01:55:05
DR. ROBERT SELLERS I also want you ah… acknowledge publically two people who are especially important in this process for me. First is Sue Chefken(ph) here Chefken(ph) ah… no. Well Sue is our conference coordinator and Sue is the person who was responsible for making sure that all of this came together in turns of the logistics of this. And she is particularly important to me in the sense that I came to Sue relatively late in this process and she has been a life saver in pulling huh… ah… all of this together and so if you get a chance to… to see Sue before it's over, just please thank her. And then the second person ah… ah… for whom I always must thank is my wife Tabby(ph), she is here. No, she has probably ran home to feed the dog, but Tabby(ph) has always ah… and I guess by law she has to do this with a tremendous support not only obviously emotionally, but in terms of logistically. So Tabby(ph) is the ah… ah… Chair of the Operations Committee and has worked with the volunteers, with Sue, with everything to make sure that all of this is there and to make sure that I wouldn't go crazy and try to micromanage stuff and but I wanna again thank her. 

01:56:45
[sil.] 

01:56:50
DR. ROBERT SELLERS It's also important ah… as many people have come up over the last few days and sort of have asked where do we go from here? When is the next conference? Ah… etc. So I just want to state where we are right now, so this is the inaugural conference. Laura said the first annual, the inaugural conference. Ah… we will go back to the ECS that's(ph) in 45 and have a discussion and make a decision as to whether or not this is something that I will continue as a conference of 45. Ah… I hope that that happens, ah… also you should know that that you're all members of 45, so ah… ah… you can have some say in that as well. Ah… but whether it happens or not, I'm also very-very hopeful that regardless we will come back together on a more regular basis to provide a forum and an avenue to do this three things that we'd hope to do in the ah… with the goals of the conference to find a place to present cut engage research ah… on our particular communities to provide a place for us to get together and come together and network and establish collaborations. And most importantly a place to provide training and opportunities for us to interact across generations, across disciplines, across ethnicities and culture. So ah… is the very last event of the conference you've got an opportunity now to go eat, drink and be merry ah… make sure that you leave here with a couple of phone numbers or e-mails that you didn't have before you came here and I hope that you've made some good friends and connections. Again thank you all for coming ah… and hope to see you all again soon. Thank you.
