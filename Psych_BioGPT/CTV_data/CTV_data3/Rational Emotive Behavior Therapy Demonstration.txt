A Conference 

00:00:20
Demonstration of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) Albert Ellis, Ph.D. Janet Wolfe, Ph.D. 

00:00:40
ALBERT ELLIS I'm Albert Ellis, as some of you probably know, and I'm the president of the Institute for Rational Emotive Therapy in New York. I'm the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, which is our new name, and I do various other nefarious things. And this is Janet Wolfe, who I don't know anything about because I've only lived with her for 30 years, but she has a PhD in clinical psychology from NYU, and she's the executive director of our institute. She has a diplomate (ph) in sexology of the American Board of Sexology. She's the author of a well-known book, "What To Do When He Has a Headache," and for the past 25 years she's pioneered in the development of integrating awareness of sex role socialization with rational emotive behavior therapy and working with women and cultures. She conducts workshops. . . 

00:01:50
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Couples, couples, dear. 

00:01:50
ALBERT ELLIS Oh, couples, right. It says cultures. Conducts workshops throughout the United States and abroad and is a consultant to numerous organizations. Now, as I told you before, first I'll do a demonstration then Janet will polish one of you off, and then, finally, we'll keep going. So, who wants to be the first volunteer for a demonstration? 

00:02:25

00:02:45
JANET WOLFE (inaudible ) 

00:02:46
ALBERT ELLIS Oh, wait. Because of the blinding lights up here, you know, we can hardly see you or anything. But, fortunately, you can see us. 

00:03:00
[sil.] 

00:03:30
BETH I don't know anything about your work, that's why I'm brave enough to do this. 

00:03:30
ALBERT ELLIS Good to meet you. 

00:03:30
JANET WOLFE And here's your water. 

00:03:35
BETH Thank you, ma'am. (inaudible ). Uh, yes. 

00:03:45
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, what is your first name? 

00:03:45
BETH My name is Beth. 

00:03:45
ALBERT ELLIS Beth. What problem would you like to start with, Beth, before I and the audience give you other problems. 

00:04:00
BETH Um, Gosh, I wasn't thinking problem, but, um, does it have to be a, a problem, or can it be, um, like, feelings I have about something that, that troubles me? 

00:04:10
ALBERT ELLIS Something that really troubles you. Something live, it doesn't have to be ancient, it could be modern, but anything that you're troubled about. 

00:04:20
BETH Okay. 

00:04:20
ALBERT ELLIS Itself, these days, do you feel anxious or depressed or angry or upset about. 

00:04:25
BETH Um, I have a lot of, I guess, sad, troubled feelings about my relationship with my mother. 

00:04:35
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. Let's take that. And do you have them at all times or when she does something that you don't like? 

00:04:45
BETH Well, she lives far away from me, and so I'm not around her very much. But, um, when I talk to her on the phone, when I think about her, I feel very troubled. 

00:04:55
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. But, could we take the word troubled break it down. Do you mean angry at her, or depressed, or anxious about what she might think of you? Or what? What's the troubled feeling. Give us a recent incident where you talked to her over the phone and you felt troubled. 

00:05:15
BETH Um, she's real, she's real complicated. Actually, I think she has, maybe, like, I, schizophrenia or something. I'm always trying to figure her out. She's not all there, I mean, there's, uh, um, so I'm always feeling, I'm not sure whether to be angry or d-, feel hurt, or to feel protective of her, or, you know, so I have to keep myself at a real distance. 

00:05:40
ALBERT ELLIS Well, was there a recent time, and, or, it even could be in the past when you felt angry about her being confused. 

00:05:45
BETH (crosstalk)Trying to be more specific. Yes, yes. 

00:05:45
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, and what happened then when you felt angry. 

00:05:50
BETH (crosstalk)Okay. Um, she called me on the phone, and, um, I was busy writing a paper, and so I was feeling anxious anyway, and she wants my sister to, um, belong and practice a certain religion. And my sister doesn't, and doesn't want to. And my mother continually sends her things, calls her, tries to get her to do this. And . . . 

00:06:15
ALBERT ELLIS And sometimes she does the same thing to you? Or mainly to your sister? 

00:06:20
BETH It's mainly to my sister. 

00:06:25
ALBERT ELLIS I see. Is she a younger sister? 

00:06:25
BETH Yes. 

00:06:25
ALBERT ELLIS Right. Alright, so you, yeah. 

00:06:25
BETH (crosstalk)So, I'm sorry. I, I said, "Why can't you just leave her alone and accept her the way she is?" 

00:06:35
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:06:35
BETH And my mother started yelling, and I started yelling, and we, finally I hung up on her. 

00:06:40
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, so I think that's fairly clear and maybe typical that not all the time, but some of the time your mother gets after your sister, particularly, and not only gets after her but keeps persisting, persisting that your sister must do what your mother wants her to do with religion or anything else. And then, when you hear that and see that, you feel angry at her. 

00:07:00
BETH Mmmhmm, yes. 

00:07:00
ALBERT ELLIS Because, at that point, what do you think you're saying to yourself, not just to your mother or your sister but to yourself, to make yourself angry? Cuz we control our feelings, and we make ourselves angry, or hurt, or whatever. What do you think goes on in your head while your mother is doing this? 

00:07:20
BETH Hmm. 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:30
BETH I guess it's mostly about their relationship. I keep thinking, "Gosh, she says she cares about her, why can't she just leave her be?" I, I love my sister, we're very, very close. 

00:07:40
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:07:40
BETH And so I th-, I, I kn-, I've felt the pain and sensed the pain my sister has about not being accepted. 

00:07:45
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:07:50
BETH And so I want, I've tried to let my mom know, and, um . . . 

00:07:55
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Right. 

00:07:55
BETH I think, "Why doesn't she get it?" 

00:08:00
ALBERT ELLIS So, you're saying, "Why doesn't she be less demanding, or less controlling of my sister. How could she be that way when she knows my sister even has problems, and still she goes on and on. 

00:08:10
BETH Yeah, why can't she just love her the way she is? 

00:08:15
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Right. So, y-, you're first wishing that your mother would act differently, but then, that won't cause anger, cuz you'd just say, "Well, I wish my mother were different, but she's been this way for years, that's the way she is." You'd feel sorry or disappointed. But, when you're angry, you're adding something else, some demand in your head, not to your mother but to you. Now, what demand do you think you're saying to yourself about your mother that makes you angry? There's a demand there, do you know what it is? 

00:08:50
[sil.] 

00:08:55
BETH I guess I don't. 

00:08:55
ALBERT ELLIS Well, it's usually, and I'm not saying in your case but you could consider it, along the line that, one, "My mother is wrong about this," and let's you and I assume she is wrong. And, "She shouldn't act that way with my sister who easily could get upset." Are you telling yourself something like that? When you're angry? 

00:09:20
BETH You know, I think the anger in this instance came, she wasn't listening to me at all, she was just talking on and on and on and on. And- 

00:09:25
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Right. As she shouldn't. 

00:09:30
BETH Right. 

00:09:30
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, you see. Without that, without that God-like, grandiose demand that, "I think my mother is wrong, in fact I know she's wrong, and she shouldn't be," you wouldn't get angry. You'd feel, as I said, sorry, disappointed, something like that. But anger, almost always, and I can't say always, is a god-like demand. Not only that my mother is wrong, and, again, I'm assuming with you she probably is wrong, but she must not, should not be wrong. Then you're gonna make yourself angry. Do you see the difference between, "I wish she weren't wrong," and, "Therefore she shouldn't be." Do you see that those two are different? 

00:10:10
BETH Mm-hmm. 

00:10:15
ALBERT ELLIS So, when you're saying, "She shouldn't be wrong," when she indubitably is wrong, then you're gonna make yourself upset. Then, when you get angry at your mother you start fighting with her or screaming with her, how do you feel at you for being angry at your poor, dear mother? 

00:10:35
BETH Badly, very badly. 

00:10:35
ALBERT ELLIS So, you feel somewhat guilty. 

00:10:35
BETH Uh huh. 

00:10:40
ALBERT ELLIS Well, in rational emotive behavior therapy we usually go for what we call the secondary disturbance first. Your first disturbance, which we're gonna get back to in a minute, it's called anger, rage, fury, something like that. But, the second one is guilt. Now, you've taken your anger from the first disturbance and you notice it, again, you say, "You know, I feel angry, and I'm off the wall about my goddamn mother." And then you feel guilty, because what do you think your should on yourself is? You have a should on yourself that you're telling yourself, right? 

00:11:15
BETH Oh, yeah. I should stay calm, I should be able to listen to her. I wasn't listening to her very well either, I didn't want to hear it. 

00:11:20
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:11:20
BETH And, um, you know, I should love my mother. 

00:11:25
ALBERT ELLIS Right, because she's your mother. 

00:11:30
BETH Right. 

00:11:30
ALBERT ELLIS Uh, alright, now, that I'm gonna question and challenge that secondary disturbance that I should not be angry, because lets assume it's unpreferable to be angry, because you're gonna upset yourself, your mother's not gonna change, it's not gonna do much good. Why must you be calm. It's good to be calm and not angry at her, but why do you have to be that way? 

00:11:55
BETH Well, probably because it really agitates me. Like you said, the anger doesn't do me any good, she doesn't get it, and so, it upsets me, and- 

00:12:05
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Right. I upset me with, I'll go back to that in a minute. But, you see, you, you did what most people do. Whenever I ask them a question, "Why must this be?" They tell me why it's preferential, why it would be good. So, it would be good if you were calm, serene, collected, etcetera, but why do you have to be what would be preferable, calm and collected, why do you have to be? 

00:12:35
BETH I don't have to be. 

00:12:35
ALBERT ELLIS That's right, now, did you really believe that when you just said it, "I don't have to be. It would be lovely, grew, but I really don't have to be unangry at my nutty mother." Did you really believe when you said it? Because, if you did, the a-, anger at you, the guilt, will go away. If you really first accept you unconditionally, even when you're screwing up and making yourself foolishly angry. So that's the first thing in rational emotive behavior therapy. We would try to get you to do, to unconditionally accept you even when you're, as I said, screwing up, when you're doing stupid things, making yourself furious at your nutty mother. But then, once you start doing that, then you get back to the original, which we said before. Now, what we call A, adversity, your mother is beating your sister over the head verbally, and in C, consequence, you're angry. Because your B is, she shouldn't be doing that wrong thing, right? Well, why should your mother, your nutty mother be unnutty and act well? Why should she? What are the chances? 

00:13:55
BETH There's not any. 

00:13:55
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. You see. Now, what could you change that to? Your mother's still acting badly, and we can practically guarantee she's gonna keep doing that, maybe for the rest of her life. What could you tell yourself instead of, "She shouldn't be that way. She must not be the way she is," that would make you just sorry and displeased rather than horrified, angry at her? What could you say to yourself? 

00:14:20
BETH I guess she's, you know, she's never gonna change, and I just need to love her the way she is. 

00:14:30
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. I could love her, accept her, not like what she does, we wouldn't want to change your goals and values. Your goal is to see people like your mother act well toward your sister, toward you, and other people. So, we don't wanna change that, but she doesn't have to be the preferable way. I can accept her, a fallible, screwed up human with her disturbance, because she is disturbed. Then you'd be unangry. Then- 

00:14:55
BETH She's not gonna ever see this video, right? I mean, I would feel really bad if she saw this video. Okay. 

00:15:05
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Yeah, right. 

00:15:05
BETH Sorry, just had a little thought. 

00:15:10
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Now, when you're angry at your mother, or think she's gonna do something, do you tend to avoid her, not talk to her, run away from it? 

00:15:20
BETH I tend to put the phone down and I feel afraid, like she's going to come. And I realize that she's in Arizona. 

00:15:25
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:15:25
BETH I can take the phone off the hook, I really am safe, and that calms me down. She really can't come or invade my life right now, so- 

00:15:35
ALBERT ELLIS Right, but do, because you know, lots of times, that she's gonna do that and help upset you, she really can't upset you but help, do you sometimes avoid her, run away fro her? 

00:15:45
BETH (crosstalk)Oh, yes. 

00:15:50
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:15:50
BETH Yes, all the, yeah. 

00:15:50
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Alright, so, what, what I would like to see you do, you don't have to, is first accept you again with your anger, don't put yourself out. Then, accept her with her nonsense. And, to help you do it, deliberately, at times, see her more rather than less, or talk to her over the phone, and practice telling yourself what you said before. "There goes my crazy mother again, still out of her fucking mind, isn't that fascinating?" You see? But don't avoid the situation. Because then you rebuild the anger. 

00:16:25
BETH And the guilt. 

00:16:25
ALBERT ELLIS And the guilt. 

00:16:30
BETH Yeah. 

00:16:30
ALBERT ELLIS Exactly, I think that's why, so, so, think differently and act differently. And I'm gonna show you a technique now of working on your feeling of anger. 

00:16:40
BETH Great. 

00:16:40
ALBERT ELLIS Close your eyes and imagine the worst. That despite our talking here today and your trying to work on it, your mother gets worse and worse and gets after your sister more and you can't stop her and you speak to her in a nice manner and say, "Look, mother, that's really, you may be right but that's not doing any good." But she goes on and she keeps persisting, persisting, plaguing, plaguing your sister. Can you vividly imagine that happening? 

00:17:10
BETH Very. 

00:17:10
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, easy. And how do you honestly feel in your gut as you imagine it? What's your honest feeling as you watch her, hear her go on and on and on. 

00:17:20
BETH Anxiety, frustration. 

00:17:25
ALBERT ELLIS Just ang-, just anxiety and frustration? 

00:17:25
BETH It's, it's- 

00:17:30
ALBERT ELLIS Do you also feel angry at times that when you've imagined her still doing it? 

00:17:35
BETH It's funny, I think the guilt in there keeps me from being angry very much. 

00:17:35
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Oh, okay. Alright, but get in touch, then, with your guilt. 

00:17:40
BETH (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:17:40
ALBERT ELLIS Make yourself guilty, guilty, guilty, because you're building up the anger, and it is your mother, so you're making yourself guilty about that. So, feel as guilty, as down and low as you can possibly be for your intolerance of your mother. Feel really, really guilty, depressed, down, low. Feel it, implode it, feel as self-downing, as guilty as you can feel, and then, keeping the same image, she's still going on and you're still, sort of, seething about it, make yourself feel only sorry and disappointed with what she and you are doing, but not guilty and not angry, just sorry and disappointed, which you can do. And tell me when you only feel sorry and disappointed. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:50
ALBERT ELLIS Change your feeling. 

00:18:55
BETH Okay, I get it (ph). 

00:18:55
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, open your eyes. How did you change it? What did you do to take the anger and the guilty and only feel sorry and disappointed about what was happening. What did you do to change that feeling? 

00:19:10
BETH I, I, um, first I, I realized how good it would feel to not have to feel guilty. 

00:19:15
ALBERT ELLIS Right, good. 

00:19:20
BETH (crosstalk)And to not be angry. 

00:19:20
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:19:20
BETH And to realize I, to realize the weight of all that on me. 

00:19:25
ALBERT ELLIS Right, that's good. 

00:19:25
BETH And then, I have Albert Ellis's permission to give that up. That's pretty good. 

00:19:30
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:19:30
BETH So, um, you know. 

00:19:35
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, that, that was very good, but you could have gone a step further and give you permission to even berate yourself, seethe, feel furious at your mother. That would be an even better thing. To have me give it is okay, but I'm not always around, I have other things to do in life. But that was a very good answer if you'd apply it to you. That I don't have to make myself horrified, upset, angry, or guilty, I give myself permission to just feel sorry and disappointed. "Too bad that my mother's that way, but that's the way she is. And too bad that I'm easily angered, or the anger at myself, but that's the way I am." Now, what I'd like you to do as a sort of training process to train your feelings. It only took you a minute to do that, it usually does take a minute. Every day for the next 30 days imagine the worst again, even if you're not talking to your mother you can imagine it. Let yourself feel guilty and angry if you do feel it, as long as you change it the way you just did, giving yourself permission to be yourself, even do the wrong thing, and then train yourself at the end of 10 or 20 or 30 days to automatically only feel a healthfully, appropriately sorry, and not enraged, and not guilty. Now, will you work about a minute or two every day until you train yourself to do that? 

00:21:10
BETH Yes. 

00:21:10
ALBERT ELLIS I'm pretty sure you will, but just to give you reinforcement, show the members of the audience how to do it, what do you like to do that you do almost every day in the week, some pleasure that you enjoy? 

00:21:25
BETH Um, I walk or run, I try to get exercise in. 

00:21:30
ALBERT ELLIS Fine. For the next 30 days don't do that until after you do the rational emotive imagery and change your feeling, then you can do it all day. 

00:21:40
BETH That might not work because- 

00:21:45
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:21:45
BETH You know, if it's cold out or whatever. Um, gosh, what's something I really like to do that I do. 

00:21:55
ALBERT ELLIS But you, you could take any ques- 

00:21:55
BETH Hug my kids or something. 

00:21:55
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:21:55
BETH Hug my kids. 

00:22:00
ALBERT ELLIS Hug your kids, alright, don't hug your kids til after you do the rational emotive imagery. 

00:22:05
BETH Okay, that would work. 

00:22:05
ALBERT ELLIS Then you can hug em. 

00:22:05
BETH Cuz that would be hard. 

00:22:05
ALBERT ELLIS What, what chore or task do you hate to do and, therefore, you avoid it. Some unpleasant task like talking to your mother, for example, uh- 

00:22:15
BETH Laundry. 

00:22:15
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:22:15
BETH Laundry. 

00:22:15
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, laundry. If bedtime arrives for the next 30 days and you haven't yet done the rational emotive imagery and changed your feeling, then you stay up for an hour doing the laundry. And if it gets all too clean you do the neighbor's laundry. Anything else you'd like to ask me about this problem right now? 

00:22:45
BETH Um, you know, I was wondering if I needed to, kind of, work on having more loving feelings towards her. And, I mean, do I need to go beyond the just- 

00:22:55
ALBERT ELLIS Oh no. If you wanna do that, now, you're not obliged to love your mother just because she's a, your mother. But, if you really get rid of your anger, minimize that, and your guilt, then she does do some nice things, she did give birth to you, she brought you up, even to your sister, so you can think of some nice things about her and you could even love her, but don't feel obliged to love her, that's not necessary. 

00:23:20
BETH (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:23:20
ALBERT ELLIS I wanna thank you for coming up and working on it, thank you. 

00:23:25
BETH (crosstalk)Thank you. 

00:23:25
ALBERT ELLIS Bye, bye. 

00:23:25
BETH And, your, your permission really will help, I, I will remember that. And mine. 

00:23:35
ALBERT ELLIS Fine, but you can do it yourself, right. Yeah, right. Okay. Thank you. 

00:23:45
BETH Now, I leave? 

00:23:50
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, right. 

00:23:50
BETH Okay. 

00:23:50
ALBERT ELLIS How about a volunteer for Janet? 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:55
JANET WOLFE Hi. What's your name? Yeah. Just, just, uh, g-, yeah, what's your name? 

00:25:05
HELEN My name's Helen. 

00:25:10
JANET WOLFE Okay, can you all hear Helen? You may wanna move this just a little, uh, closer to your mouth. Is it wobbling? 

00:25:15
HELEN How's that? So's my hand. 

00:25:20
JANET WOLFE Oh. Push, it needs to be on the left. There you go. 

00:25:25
HELEN Okay. Thank you. 

00:25:30
JANET WOLFE When you do enough talk shows you get to be an electronic genius. What, uh, is the problem you'd like to work on? 

00:25:35
HELEN Well, Janet, I'm really angry. I got mad at my husband and my brother last week. Um, my husband called my brother and, uh, passed the phone to me and we chatted a few minutes, and then I gave the phone back to him and I went downstairs and sat and they were talking on the phone. And, not meaning to eavesdrop, but I did hear them, um, I heard my- 

00:26:00
JANET WOLFE Did you just happen to hear them cuz the extension fell of the hook and you picked it up? 

00:26:05
HELEN No, no. 

00:26:05
JANET WOLFE Or you heard them directly? 

00:26:05
HELEN (crosstalk)There was, there was no extension in the room. There was no extension in the room where I was. And I was in a recliner reading, and I heard my husband say to my brother, "Well, that's the tact I've taken for the last two months. Um, I'm just agreeing with anything she says and I'm not a very good actor, but that's just what I've been doing for two months. For the last two months." And so I realized, "Hey, those two guys are in collusion on how to handle me." And I was very angry. 

00:26:35
JANET WOLFE And you're pretty sure they were talking about you? 

00:26:40
HELEN Well, yes I was, my hus- 

00:26:40
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Yeah. And let's assume that they were. 

00:26:45
HELEN Okay. 

00:26:45
JANET WOLFE We like to assume the worst. 

00:26:45
HELEN Yes, yes. 

00:26:45
JANET WOLFE Uh, and you were feeling angry at that point? 

00:26:50
HELEN Well, I was very angry, and, and they said some other things, well my husband said something else that made me even more angry. 

00:26:55
JANET WOLFE What was that? 

00:27:00
HELEN Well, he said that he had, um, put some money away in a certain place and he was telling my brother that, um, if anything ever happened to him that he should look there for the money. And so, then I was really pissed, cuz I thought, "Why would he tell his brother," I mean, his brother-in-law, "this and not his own wife?" 

00:27:15
JANET WOLFE And how long have you been together? 

00:27:20
HELEN 38 years. 

00:27:20
JANET WOLFE Ah, I see. So, was there anything other than anger you were feeling here? 

00:27:25
HELEN Uh, betrayed. I was, uh, extremely angry, I felt betrayed. 

00:27:30
JANET WOLFE When you say betrayed, what, what does that feel like? 

00:27:35
HELEN Uh, well it feels like, "Hey, I don't have any friends here." These, these- 

00:27:40
JANET WOLFE Does that mean depressed? Possibly? 

00:27:45
HELEN Oh, you know, I did feel depressed after that. 

00:27:45
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Also, might there have been any anxiety? 

00:27:50
HELEN Yes, there was anxiety. 

00:27:50
JANET WOLFE And- 

00:27:50
HELEN These are significant people in my life. 

00:27:55
JANET WOLFE Right. So, so the, the activating event here is you hear your, your husband colluding with your brother and it a-, appears that things are going on behind your back that may wind up excluding you at some point. 

00:28:05
HELEN Exactly. 

00:28:05
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)So, I would imagine you might feel somewhat anxious as well as angry and betrayed or depressed. So tell me, in the time we have, what were some of the thoughts that were going through that, your head at that time if you put yourself back into that state, just sort of free associate, voice all the thoughts that were going through you. 

00:28:25
HELEN Okay, uh, can I just tell you what I did? 

00:28:25
JANET WOLFE Uh, you could do that. 

00:28:25
HELEN Okay, cuz I'm, the thing that was going through my mind was, "Hey, they don't need to be talking to each other about this, they need to be including me in this conversation." 

00:28:35
JANET WOLFE And then what did you do? 

00:28:40
HELEN So, I went upstairs, uh, to an extension phone, and I just picked up and I said, "Are you two guys having a conversation that I should be a part of." Should. Because I feel like I should be a part of that conversation. 

00:28:55
JANET WOLFE And how did they res-, how did your husband respond, or how did they respond? 

00:28:55
HELEN Well, my brother responded first and he said, "Oh, no, we were just talking," and then, so he spit out a big lie of some trivia, which was not at all what they were saying. 

00:29:05
JANET WOLFE I see. And how did you feel at that point? 

00:29:10
HELEN Uh, really angry. My heart was beating fast and I was so angry. 

00:29:15
JANET WOLFE So, instead of getting some possible reassurance and they're saying, "Sorry, we really should have included you," you got s-, a further signal that you were being betrayed and ex-, and potentially excluded. 

00:29:25
HELEN Yes, I did. 

00:29:25
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Okay, now give me all the thoughts that were going through your head. 

00:29:30
HELEN All the thoughts that were going through my head, let's see. 

00:29:30
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Yeah, at this double exclusion. 

00:29:30
HELEN My heart was beating fast, I moved the phone away from my mouth and I sat there for a minute and so I thought, "Okay, I've given them a chance to be honest, they chose not to, I don't have to let them know how I feel." And so I said, "I'll see you later," and hung up the phone. My thoughts were hurt. 

00:29:55
JANET WOLFE So you, so you at least stopped yourself trying to escalate the situation at that point. 

00:30:00
HELEN Oh yeah, I thought- 

00:30:00
JANET WOLFE You decided to back off and, yeah. 

00:30:00
HELEN (crosstalk)Give my, I need time to think about this. 

00:30:05
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Okay. And when you were thinking, and when you were really feeling upset about the exclusion, what were you th-, what were you thinking, what were some of your thoughts? 

00:30:15
HELEN Well I was thinking, other than, I was thinking, "I'm gonna give myself time to think how to respond to this." 

00:30:20
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:30:20
HELEN Um- 

00:30:25
JANET WOLFE When you were really feeling angry, anxious, betrayed, give me all the thoughts, just as they pop into your head. 

00:30:35
HELEN Well, I mean, like, who the hell do they think they are? You know, why do they show respect for each other and not for me? 

00:30:40
JANET WOLFE And is there any should behind there? 

00:30:40
HELEN Uh, well, they, they should show res-. Yep, there's a good should. 

00:30:50
JANET WOLFE They should. 

00:30:50
HELEN Well, I mean, a man should tell his wife and not his brother-in-law, you know, if his- 

00:30:55
JANET WOLFE Okay, so my husband should involve me. 

00:30:55
HELEN He should. 

00:30:55
JANET WOLFE And give me some more thoughts. And if he didn't? 

00:31:00
HELEN Um, well, if he didn't he's just gonna be the loser, but so would I, because the relationship suffers, because then I'm angry. 

00:31:10
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)And if the relationship suffers, what's the worst thing that can happen? 

00:31:10
HELEN Uh, it's that we don't communicate, we sit around with angry looks and, and life's no fun. 

00:31:20
JANET WOLFE Is that the worst that could happen? Is that you'll just deteriorate and sort of, you know, uh, boycott each other? 

00:31:25
HELEN Uh, well, no, I guess the worst that could happened be that, uh, one of us will just outright leave, you know, after 38 years. 

00:31:30
JANET WOLFE And? If that happened? 

00:31:35
HELEN Well, if that happened, um, we'd each survive. 

00:31:40
JANET WOLFE Oh, you would? So you do believe that. Well, there's a piece. 

00:31:45
HELEN I'm sure, yeah. 

00:31:45
JANET WOLFE Okay, there's a piece of strength there. Now, if, if you really had that belief that I could survive if the relationship end what, ended, what are, what do you think is really the, the thing that's driving you to feel so angry and betrayed and hurt? And he did do a bad thing, he did exclude you from financial planning, which isn't the first and the last time we've ever heard it, I've certainly seen enough women whose husbands, you know, sort of signed away the family fortune before they found out about it, but, uh, what i-, what are the things that are really maintaining the anger? 

00:32:15
HELEN (crosstalk)You know, I really think what made me feel angry and betrayed was, was harking back to a childhood time. 

00:32:20
JANET WOLFE Okay, and what was that? 

00:32:20
HELEN (crosstalk)And my, when I was a teenager and my parents had divorced and I had a stepdad that I just, you know, had hated, I told him, you know, he's not my father, don't act like my father, leave me alone. And life would be fine. And, and, um, at one point my mother was trying to make me just hush my angry outburst and, and she picked up the phone and pretended to call the juvenile authorities saying if I didn't behave then she would just have me put away. And so, my brother was standing there with her, his goal being harmony in the home. 

00:33:00
JANET WOLFE The same brother? 

00:33:00
HELEN (crosstalk)And he told me later. The same brother. Two years older. 

00:33:00
JANET WOLFE I see. 

00:33:00
HELEN And so, even though my brother and I have talked since and, and he has changed his stance, um, it was still an attempt to control me. 

00:33:15
JANET WOLFE Alright, so, it sounds like it brought back that, that, that child, the memory of a childhood- 

00:33:20
HELEN It did, it brought back those same- 

00:33:20
JANET WOLFE -where my brother is once again plotting against me and, and pretending to be my ally, but really acting against me. 

00:33:25
HELEN Exactly. 

00:33:25
JANET WOLFE And what does that mean to you about you that he's doing that? 

00:33:30
HELEN Um, what does that mean to me about me? 

00:33:30
JANET WOLFE Yeah. That your brother can betray you and continue to betray you and plot with your own mother and your own husband against you, exclude important information, talk about how to handle your life, where to send you. 

00:33:50
HELEN See, I think- 

00:33:50
JANET WOLFE What does that mean to you about you that, that they're able to do this. Are you putting yourself down in any way? 

00:33:55
HELEN (crosstalk)Well, it's still, it's, well, I certainly feel like the little kid sister again. 

00:34:00
JANET WOLFE Yeah, and what does that feel like for you? 

00:34:05
HELEN And, um, that does not feel good. 

00:34:05
JANET WOLFE What does it feel like? 

00:34:05
HELEN (crosstalk)That feels, um, less powerful. 

00:34:10
JANET WOLFE That if they can, sort of, treat me like, infantilize me, in a way, and- 

00:34:15
HELEN That's it. 

00:34:15
JANET WOLFE -talk about how to run my life behind my back, that that makes me less adequate. Now does it? 

00:34:20
HELEN Yes. 

00:34:20
JANET WOLFE Let's look at that some. 

00:34:25
HELEN No, it does not. 

00:34:25
JANET WOLFE Why doesn't it? 

00:34:25
HELEN (crosstalk)It does not. It does not, because I'm capable, I can run my own life, I'm not where I am by the- 

00:34:30
JANET WOLFE And you could, and you could even survive financially on your own even if they conspire to take away all your assets. 

00:34:35
HELEN (crosstalk)Yes, I could. Yes, I could. 

00:34:40
JANET WOLFE Okay, now, suppose you really thought that at the time. You thought, you know, "Darn, I don't like the fact that they're colluding against me, infantilizing me, trying to exclude me from financial posi-, decisions, but if they do, that doesn't make me an inadequate, helpless child." Suppose you thought that. How do you think you'd feel? 

00:34:55
HELEN Then, I would feel fine. 

00:34:55
JANET WOLFE Would you? 

00:34:55
HELEN I would've just thought, "Well, fuck them." 

00:35:00
JANET WOLFE Well, I don't, that may be going to another extreme. Unfuck them is the correct term, anyway. 

00:35:05
HELEN (crosstalk)But I would. But I w-, I would have felt better. 

00:35:05
JANET WOLFE Yeah. 

00:35:05
HELEN I felt bad because I felt, um, less power than they had. 

00:35:10
JANET WOLFE So, the real core, irrational belief here is not that they're taking away, uh, that they're colluding behind my back and I wish they weren't, those are perfectly rational thoughts, nor is the irrational thought that, uh, "I don't like being treated in this infantilized way." Do you see that there may be a should behind there? That you're saying more than I, just, that I'd prefer they not infantilize me and exclude me, but they must not, it's horrible, it's demeaning, it makes me inadequate. That that seems to be the toxic thought. Now what, let's, let's just see if we can figure out what you could say to yourself instead should this happen again and you feel they're kind of, you know, patronizing you and saying, you know, "She's on the rag this month, we've gotta humor her," or. . . 

00:36:00
HELEN Right. 

00:36:00
JANET WOLFE Or, "Listen, I'm salting (ph) away some money so she can't get it." And you're not gonna, you're not gonna expect to feel happy and good about that, is that, we agree on that? 

00:36:10
HELEN We agree on that. 

00:36:10
JANET WOLFE So, how would you like to be able to feel when, if, when and if that happens again? 

00:36:15
HELEN Well, what I'd like to do is just go on with what I'm doing. I mean, that didn't really change anything that I've done since. 

00:36:20
JANET WOLFE So, you'd like to continue with your life, and how, what em- 

00:36:25
HELEN (crosstalk)Just maintain my clear feelings. 

00:36:25
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)And what emotion do you think would be appropriate to experience when you see your, your husband and your brother, kind of, infantilizing you and- 

00:36:35
HELEN Just some detachment from that, I think. Just- 

00:36:35
JANET WOLFE Well, would you feel happy about it? 

00:36:40
HELEN Well, I don't think I'd ever feel happy about it. 

00:36:40
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Yeah, I would c-, be concerned if you did. 

00:36:45
HELEN (crosstalk)I mean, I think I'd be sad because, yeah. 

00:36:45
JANET WOLFE But, disappointed, moderately frustrated, maybe. 

00:36:45
HELEN (crosstalk)Disappointed, yes. 

00:36:50
JANET WOLFE Annoyed. Okay. 

00:36:50
HELEN All of this. 

00:36:50
JANET WOLFE Now, give me the thought that you would really have to maintain, then, in order to achieve those appropriate negative feelings. 

00:36:55
HELEN Okay, I think I could think, um, that this is disappointing, that they're behaving this way, but it doesn't alter. 

00:37:05
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Actually, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna play devil's advocate if I don't strangle myself in the process. 

00:37:10
HELEN (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:37:10
JANET WOLFE Um, I'm gonna voice aloud behind you what I consider to be your, probably still, somewhat, moderately strongly-held irrational beliefs. 

00:37:20
HELEN Okay. 

00:37:20
JANET WOLFE And I want you to argue against them. 

00:37:20
HELEN Okay. 

00:37:20
JANET WOLFE We'll both use first person, okay? 

00:37:25
HELEN Okay. 

00:37:25
JANET WOLFE I say that, but I don't know if I really believe that. 

00:37:30
HELEN Okay. 

00:37:30
JANET WOLFE That I'm just disappointed. The fact is, I'm really pissed. 

00:37:35
HELEN Yes, I am really pissed. 

00:37:35
JANET WOLFE Because I'm still telling myself what? 

00:37:40
HELEN Ah, because I'm still telling myself it shouldn't be this way. 

00:37:45
JANET WOLFE That's right. And it, and- 

00:37:45
HELEN (crosstalk)After 38 years- 

00:37:45
JANET WOLFE And I think you're right, it really shouldn't be this way. Husband's should never ex- uh, re-, uh, hide financial information from their wives and make cracks about how you have to treat these women with kid gloves. They should never do that. And one's brother should never collude with one's husband when they do do that. Don't you agree? 

00:38:10
HELEN I agree with that. 

00:38:10
JANET WOLFE Well, you're not supposed to. Your only mandate here, or womandate, if you prefer. 

00:38:15
HELEN Is to, is to- 

00:38:20
JANET WOLFE Is to argue against me. 

00:38:20
HELEN (crosstalk)Argue with you. 

00:38:20
JANET WOLFE Cuz I had a feeling you'd kinda wispily believe those things. Okay. 

00:38:25
HELEN Okay, let's let me argue with that, then. 

00:38:25
JANET WOLFE Let's see if we can argue again. So then, husbands and brother should not patronize and, and, uh, collude against their husband, uh, their wife and sister respectively. 

00:38:40
HELEN Well, they can do that if they want to. That's- 

00:38:40
JANET WOLFE But I can't stand it when they do. 

00:38:40
HELEN Well, it doesn't hurt you, does it? Not really? 

00:38:45
JANET WOLFE It really does, it hurts my feelings. 

00:38:45
HELEN Yeah, but what's hurting your f- 

00:38:50
JANET WOLFE Makes me feel depressed and depra-, betrayed. 

00:38:50
HELEN Oh, but they're not making you feel depressed and detrayed, you're making yourself feel depressed and betrayed. 

00:39:00
JANET WOLFE Yeah, I say that, but I think that's cuz I just happened to go to an Albert Ellis workshop. I don't know if I, I, I, I thought I'd believe it intellectually but I don't know if I really got it emotionally. 

00:39:10
HELEN You know, I think you do. I think you do. 

00:39:15
JANET WOLFE Yeah? 

00:39:15
HELEN I think you'll remember this next time it comes up. 

00:39:15
JANET WOLFE And what'll you re-, really remember? What'll be the coping statements that, maybe, you can go out right now and write down so that the next time any of this simul-, stimuli occur, that you can really remind yourself and keep yourself from adding insult to injury by getting emotionally disturbed over their bad behavior? What would be the key thoughts? 

00:39:35
HELEN Whatever the people around me do or don't do, I can still take care of myself. And it's okay. 

00:39:40
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Great. And I don't like it, well, it isn't really. 

00:39:45
HELEN I don't like it. 

00:39:45
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Is it really okay that my husband and my brother are treating me in this fashion? 

00:39:50
HELEN Well, no, I don't like that, but by saying it's okay, I mean thank God I can take care of myself. 

00:39:55
JANET WOLFE And I can stand what I don't like it sounds like. 

00:40:00
HELEN And I have before and I will again, and that just is part of life. Uh, yes, I can stand what I don't like. 

00:40:05
JANET WOLFE Okay. 

00:40:05
HELEN And do something else. I'll do that. 

00:40:05
JANET WOLFE And if, in fact, they do continue to behave that obnoxiously, you, in fact, may be the one that would make, ultimately make the decision to remove yourself from people who treat you in this infantilizing way. Perhaps. 

00:40:20
HELEN Perhaps. 

00:40:20
JANET WOLFE But, you'd freely make it, not out of rage and vindictiveness and hurt, but out of a rational choice. 

00:40:25
HELEN Exactly. 

00:40:25
JANET WOLFE (crosstalk)Okay, good, thank you. 

00:40:25
HELEN Thank you. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:41:30
JANET WOLFE Excuse me, pause for hair. Hair combing. 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:42:05
ALBERT ELLIS What is your first name? 

00:42:05
MEGAN Megan. 

00:42:05
ALBERT ELLIS Megan? 

00:42:10
MEGAN Megan. 

00:42:10
ALBERT ELLIS Okay, Megan, what problem would you like to start with? 

00:42:10
MEGAN Um, I guess, I'm just in the process of breaking up with my boyfriend. 

00:42:15
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:42:15
MEGAN And, it's been five years, and it's strictly over a religion issue, which I find very difficult. 

00:42:25
ALBERT ELLIS And, how do you feel about this breakup? 

00:42:25
MEGAN Uh, I feel a lot of resentment towards- 

00:42:30
ALBERT ELLIS Toward him? 

00:42:30
MEGAN Mmmhmm, and his family. 

00:42:35
ALBERT ELLIS So, but, you mean his family was instrumental in breaking it off? 

00:42:40
MEGAN Well, I think, uh, they dictate to him, most definitely. 

00:42:45
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. So, and if they hadn't stuck their big interference in, it probably would have gone on? 

00:42:50
MEGAN Right. 

00:42:50
ALBERT ELLIS Because the two of you were okay if only he had divorced his parents, right? 

00:42:55
MEGAN (crosstalk)Exactly. 

00:42:55
ALBERT ELLIS Right. Alright, but let's assume you're correct that they really did interfere. You could be paranoid, making that up, but let's assume you're correct. Now, what are you saying about that, their interference, their unfair interference, that's making you resentful? See if you can figure out. I already know, cuz I have a good theory, but let's see if you can figure what you're telling yourself when you're resentful. 

00:43:30
MEGAN When I'm resentful? 

00:43:30
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, about them. 

00:43:35
MEGAN Well, it's just, it's so, uh, blatant whenever I go over there, whenever, you know, I'm with them, e-, even alone without him, or when he's there, it's just the way they treat me. 

00:43:45
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:43:45
MEGAN It's, just, it makes me so angry. 

00:43:50
ALBERT ELLIS Because you're saying something, because suppose they did it to a thousand women like you, would every single on of em feel equally angry? 

00:44:00
MEGAN I mean, I'm sure I take it very personally cuz I'm a very sensitive person. And, you know- 

00:44:05
ALBERT ELLIS That's right, you're that kind of person. And the kind of person you are, whenever you're angry at them or anybody, says something, has a philosophy of creating the anger. Now, what do you think yours is. And let's assume, again, they're acting badly. Now, what are you thinking, saying, imagining, to you to make yourself angry at them? Because you don't have to be angry. 

00:44:35
MEGAN I guess I just feel such an overwhelming sense of rejection. And- 

00:44:40
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:44:40
MEGAN I guess I'm belittling myself by letting them, you know, impose that, so- 

00:44:45
ALBERT ELLIS Right. So, so, first I hear you saying, and I think that's correct, two things. First, you feel rejected by them. And you feel very hurt and downed about that. And then, you feel angry about the rejection, right? Well, we'll start with the anger first, then get back to the rejection. Let's assume that they really are unfairly doing you in and helping you feel down, low, hurt. Let's assume that. Now, what are you saying about them to yourself that demands that they not do that? What's your demand on them? 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:35
ALBERT ELLIS Cuz they're acting badly. You feel hurt. What's your demand when you're angry at them? 

00:45:45
MEGAN I mean, I guess, I mean, I think I, I don't, I mean, I don't know how to answer that cuz I think I really repress so many of my feelings when I'm around him because all our arguments are based on his parents. 

00:45:55
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. And, and he is foolishly accepting those arguments, right? 

00:46:05
MEGAN I just feel he sides with them more than he does with me. 

00:46:05
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Right, so, I hear you resentful at him for accepting the arguments and them for having made them, right? Because what are you saying about their unfairly doing that to you? You're saying something to yourself that's making you upset, angry. 

00:46:25
MEGAN I guess I'm allowing it. 

00:46:25
ALBERT ELLIS That you're allowing it? 

00:46:25
MEGAN Well, I'm not doing, really, anything about it. 

00:46:30
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, but- 

00:46:30
MEGAN I mean, I could- 

00:46:30
ALBERT ELLIS See, there we get back, again, and I'm gonna sidetrack you for a minute til you're hurt, you're self-doubting, but, when you're angry, you can't get angry without demanding that people do or not do something. And they're doing something wrong, bad. Now, what are you saying to yourself about their mistakes and about his, your male friend's going along with them? You're saying something about that to yourself. It has a demand in it, do you know what that is? They're acting bad- 

00:47:10
MEGAN That's the way they are, that's the way their, for generations, that's the way- 

00:47:10
ALBERT ELLIS Well, that would be great, but then you wouldn't be angry. You see, if you said, "There they are acting the rotten way that they usually do, isn't that fascinating?" You see, you wouldn't be angry, aren't you also saying, "And, because they're so unfair and because he's foolishly listening to them, they shouldn't be that way?" Right? 

00:47:40
MEGAN (crosstalk)Mmhmm, most definitely, yeah, unequivocally. 

00:47:40
ALBERT ELLIS Right. But, why shouldn't they be as rotten as they indubitably are? 

00:47:50
MEGAN Well, they should be happy for us. I mean, they should be accepting, but they're not. 

00:47:55
ALBERT ELLIS Well, that's exactly the point. They preferably should be accepting, because there's nothing that bad about you and they're not giving you a fair chance. But, why do they have to do what's preferable? 

00:48:05
MEGAN It's the control factor. It's because it's not what, they're more interested in what they want rather than what their son wants. 

00:48:15
ALBERT ELLIS But isn't that the way the world is? That the world will frequently do what it wants badly, wrongly, and not what they preferably could and preferably should do? See, now, if you would accept that, not like it, cuz we don't like you to like it, we don't wanna change your values. If you would accept that, then, again, you'd feel frustrated and annoyed at what they're doing, but not angry at them for doing it. See? Then, you could get back to your self-doubting, your feeling low, hurt. When they're doing these things and talking badly about you, and he's going along with that, you feel down, low, hurt, because you're saying, "What about you?" to make yourself feel that way. They're putting me down and, what? 

00:49:10
MEGAN I shouldn't let them, I shouldn't let them affect me. I mean, I should be strong enough just to say- 

00:49:15
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. That's exactly right. 

00:49:20
MEGAN (crosstalk)Too bad. 

00:49:20
ALBERT ELLIS That, somehow, I should have the power to stop these idiots from being as idiotic as they are, right? 

00:49:25
MEGAN Can you send this to them? It's one video I would like sent. 

00:49:30
ALBERT ELLIS But when, when you're putting yourself down, aren't you demanding that you somehow should, ought have control over them, and you're too weak, and you're not doing as you should? Isn't that why you're putting yourself down? Well, it would be lovely if you had control over them, the screwballs, but how are you gonna get it? How are you gonna get into their heads and change them? 

00:49:55
MEGAN You can't change someone. I mean, you have to change yourself. 

00:50:00
ALBERT ELLIS Therefore, why couldn't you say, "I wish to hell that I had that power and I was very strong and, maybe, stronger than I am, but I don't have to be. I can do my best to change them, and I, apparently, have for five years." Did it work? 

00:50:20
MEGAN Uh, to an a-, to an extent. I mean, you just learn to cope or live, I mean. You just, sort of- 

00:50:25
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)For a while. Right. 

00:50:25
MEGAN I don't know if you evade, or it's your protection mechanisms, or- 

00:50:30
ALBERT ELLIS Right. But, when anybody puts you down or acts badly to you and you cannot stop them, you're too weak to do it, you don't have the magical power of stopping them, then why not unconditionally accept you even if you are weak? Let's just suppose you could have been stronger in your way. Now, what stops you from saying, "That's bad, but I'm still okay. I can always accept myself." What stops you from doing that? 

00:51:00
MEGAN Me. 

00:51:05
ALBERT ELLIS Because? Why don't you do that? Wouldn't you get much better results? 

00:51:05
MEGAN Yes. No, I just, I mean, I think, uh, I, I, whenever, uh, you know, a problem a-, arises, I do. I just, you know, take a deep breath and say, "I'm a good person, and, you know, I can overcome this." But still, it just, it causes so much conflict. 

00:51:25
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. It will cause you conflict, and, sometimes, you can't stop your anger. Sometimes your resentment, and you may not even want to, and you certainly can't control them because you're a fallible human who, at times, acts weakly. Now, what's so horrible about that? That at times you act weakly and don't push people to get your way. Why is that horrible? 

00:51:55
MEGAN It's not so horrible, but no one likes to be vulnerable and weak. It's, you know, it's something that my parents instilled in me to- 

00:52:00
ALBERT ELLIS But, but if you keep putting yourself down for acting weakly, will that make you act stronger? 

00:52:05
MEGAN No. 

00:52:05
ALBERT ELLIS No. So, therefore, wouldn't it be better to, first, accept you with your weakness, and then push yourself, assert yourself, practice, with the next boyfriend, not for five years, acting better? 

00:52:20
MEGAN Yes. 

00:52:20
ALBERT ELLIS You see. Now, let me just give you, briefly, rational emotive imagery. Close your eyes and imagine that, despite talking to a great therapist like me today, that you still, with other people, act similarly. Weakly, weakly, you could assert yourself and you don't, or you only assert yourself very weakly. Can you, vividly, imagine that? And how do you, honestly, feel in your heart and your gut as you imagine that? What's your honest feeling about you? 

00:53:00
[sil.] 

00:53:05
MEGAN It makes me feel angry. 

00:53:05
ALBERT ELLIS At you? Right, alright, get in touch with that. Get really angry. Put yourself down. Really beat yourself for being much weaker than you could, theoretically, be. Beat yourself, feel low, angry at you. And then, keeping the same image, don't change the image, cuz you're really acting very badly, weakly, make yourself feel only displeased with your behavior, but not angry at you. And tell me what you can do when you're only displeased at what you're doing, "Sorry about that," but not angry at you. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:50
ALBERT ELLIS Okay, you did that? Open your eyes. Now, what did you do to change your feeling? 

00:53:55
MEGAN I just accepted myself. 

00:54:00
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:54:00
MEGAN And just realized that I am gonna feel vulnerable and weak at times and that's okay. 

00:54:05
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. Well, it's not that okay to be weak, but you're okay even when you're weak. Don't say, "It's okay," cuz then you might practice weakness, we don't want you to do that. But that was good. Now, what you do is every day, again, it only takes a minute or two, imagine the worst. You're acting badly, weakly. Let yourself feel down, low, depressed, guilty, enraged at yourself, and then change it the way you did just now and several other good coping statements that will occur to you. Now, would you practice that once a day til you train yourself to not put you down, no matter what you do. Just put it down. Will you do that? Alright, I think you will. But, again, we'll just give your opperine (ph) conditioning to show the audience how to do it. What do you like to do that you do almost every day in the week? 

00:55:00
MEGAN Uh, fencing. 

00:55:00
ALBERT ELLIS Do what? 

00:55:00
MEGAN Fencing. 

00:55:00
ALBERT ELLIS Fencing? 

00:55:00
MEGAN Not building, but fencing. 

00:55:05
ALBERT ELLIS Oh, okay, none of that for the next 30 days til after you do the rational emotive imagery and change your feeling. What do you hate to do, something annoying, obnoxious, that you usually don't do? 

00:55:15
MEGAN Um, cleaning my apartment. 

00:55:20
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, if bedtime comes and you haven't done the rational emotive imagery you stay up for at least an hour cleaning your apartment. 

00:55:30
MEGAN Oh, God. 

00:55:30
ALBERT ELLIS And, if it gets too clean, you clean your neighbors' apartments. Anything we may have omitted about this problem? 

00:55:40
[sil.] 

00:55:45
MEGAN I guess the main thing is I, I just find so much overwhelming resentment towards him more so than his parents. So, I mean, I think that's where, that's my main- 

00:55:55
ALBERT ELLIS You find it overwhelming that- 

00:55:55
MEGAN Resentment towards him that he can't stand up to his parents. 

00:56:00
ALBERT ELLIS (crosstalk)Yeah, well, that's right, del, I think, and I think that's a very good point you're making, that most of the resentment's probably not toward them because they are what they are. 

00:56:05
MEGAN (crosstalk)It's towards him. 

00:56:05
ALBERT ELLIS But that he shouldn't be this way. He should have supported you, and, preferably, you're on the right track. If he really cared for you and loved you, and was not a ninny with his parents, then he would have done that. But you better accept him as a fallible, screwed up human with his nonsense. 

00:56:25
MEGAN Alright. 

00:56:25
ALBERT ELLIS Thank you. 

00:56:25
MEGAN Thank you. 

00:56:30
ALBERT ELLIS Bye. 

00:56:35
[sil.] 

00:56:40
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:56:40
MEGAN (inaudible ) 

00:56:41
ALBERT ELLIS Your what? 

00:56:41
MEGAN (inaudible ) 

00:56:45
ALBERT ELLIS Sure, sure. Right. Well, we have a couple of minutes left if anybody can get some, a question in. 

00:57:00
JANET WOLFE Anybody out there? Are there any questioners out there? We can't really see. 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN The mike's not on back here. 

00:57:10
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:57:10
JANET WOLFE Oh. Well. . . 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN Hello? Can you hear me? 

00:57:15
JANET WOLFE Yeah. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Uh, my question would be if you saw, um, the individuals as clients, what would you pick up with the second session when they would come back to see you? How would you enter into the second session after giving them the homework assignment? 

00:57:30
ALBERT ELLIS Let me, briefly, answer, then Janet'll briefly answer. We check to see whether they did it, and if they didn't do it, or did it partly, what they're telling themselves to not do it, because they are, eh, goofing on doing it, why they didn't do it. And then, as we check that and, maybe, reassign it if they didn't do it but, we'll keep going. If they did do it, then we go on with what still bothers you about that which we talked about last time or any other thing that you're still bothered about. 

00:58:10
JANET WOLFE Uh, as part of the first session, we also would have done a fairly extensive history, and we have a, a four page biographical form, so, by the beginning of the second session, not only would we have checked up on homework, but we will have started to develop a treatment plan. And the way I do it is I actually work out with the client a goal sheet in which they state the behaviors they wanna increase, behaviors they wanna decrease, thoughts they wanna increase, thoughts they may wanna increase, decrease. And, in the case of my client, I might scan across her life to see if there are any other areas in which she feels powerless and weak. She might, for example, benefit from some assertiveness training. So, we would go with whatever the treatment plan steered us toward. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN How would- 

00:58:50
ALBERT ELLIS We have one minute left, anybody want a very quick comment or question? 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN How would you deal with someone, I'm over here to your right. Um, how would you deal with someone who has a problem with emotion and has no problem intellectualizing? 

00:59:05
ALBERT ELLIS Well, intellectualizing means, as Janet showed before in her demonstration, that you likely (ph) believe something, "It's okay if I fail or if other people do me in it's not too bad," but that you have strongly, rigorously, forcefully believe the opposite. So, we show them that the intellectualizing is not exactly correct. It's partly correct. And that they may even use that so as not to fully change their basic attitude. Do you wanna say something? 

00:59:40
JANET WOLFE I wasn't clear was the, was the question, "What do you do with people who are not, who are more intellectualized but not emotive?" 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:59:45
JANET WOLFE Yeah. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN They have no problem with rational thinking. 

00:59:45
JANET WOLFE Right. Then, then I might do a variety of nonverbal exercises, get them to close their eyes and really get in touch with their body sensations and, and develop, help them develop more of a comfort with acknowledging their feelings and a better ability to label them and to deal with whatever irrational cognitions that were operative in making them scared of their feelings or having difficulty in accessing them. They may have discomfort, it, intolerance for strong feelings. They simply may not have an emotional vocabulary. 

01:00:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:00:20
JANET WOLFE Thank you. 

01:00:20
ALBERT ELLIS Okay, thank you. Time's up.
