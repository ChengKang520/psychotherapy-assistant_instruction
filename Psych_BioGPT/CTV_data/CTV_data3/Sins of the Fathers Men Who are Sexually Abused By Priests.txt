PRIMARY focus 

00:00:05
GARY HAYES Sometimes people ask me when -- if I lost my faith, and I say "no" because, um, this man stole my faith. 

00:00:40
"Sins of the Fathers" Produced by Mona Hennein 

00:00:40
NARRATOR Many would say it's a wonder that the Reverend Gary Hayes became a man of the cloth. 

00:00:45
Reverend Gary Hayes 

00:00:45
GARY HAYES So, he stole my innocence, my ability to believe that God could care anything about me. Um, because I must be so horrible that God would let this happen to me, that somehow God thought I deserved this. 

00:01:00
NARRATOR He was a victim of child sex abuse from the one man he thought could be trusted. 

00:01:05
GARY HAYES You know, when I was growing up, priests were, you know, like God. It was inconceivable really that a priest would do anything wrong. Um, so, as wrong as this is, you understand something's not right, but if Father's doing it, it can't be that bad. 

00:01:30
NARRATOR When Gary was 15, he worked for the new pastor at his church rectory in southern New Jersey. 

00:01:35
GARY HAYES And he knew I was interested in being a priest. So, uh, he kind of befriended me and said he would, uh, share his experience of -- I don't know, 20-some years of priesthood with me. So, that he would help me, you know, become a good priest. And, um, and some of the things he wanted to share just have nothing to do with what a good priest is, uh, so, uh, but I didn't know that at the beginning. 

00:02:10
NARRATOR The beginning of a twisted relationship young Gary was unable to understand. 

00:02:15
GARY HAYES You know, he would make different sexual advances and things got more difficult to handle and, uh, and it just became a nightmare, uh. 

00:02:30
NARRATOR A nightmare Gary had to live through alone. 

00:02:30
GARY HAYES But to say that about a priest, ain't nobody will believe you. Who would believe a kid over a priest? Nobody. 

00:02:40
NARRATOR Gary didn't talk about his experience until ten years later at seminary when he sought counsel from a fellow priest. 

00:02:50
GARY HAYES He basically told me it shouldn't be a problem and that's a lot of, you know, that's kind of a lot of the advice I got through my history was, um, "Well, you know, it happened in the past. It's over. Um, why don't you just get on with your life?" Um, and so, I tried that, but I failed miserably. 

00:03:10
OLAN HORNE People say all the time, "Oh, you know, when are you gonna get on with it?" "You know, aren't you looking for some peace?" I would love to walk away from this. 

00:03:20
NARRATOR Olan Horne was 12 years old when he says Father Joe Birmingham, a parish priest from the Boston Archdiocese, sexually abused him. 

00:03:30
Olan Horne 

00:03:30
OLAN HORNE It changed everything in my life, and I didn't even understand it. I didn't understand it sexually, mentally, socially, morally. I didn't understand it. It was a big bad car accident, and I was living in a fog. That's what it does to you. That's what it did to me. 

00:03:45
NARRATOR What's hard for Olan to overcome is the feeling of double-betrayal, first from his pastor and second from his church. 

00:03:55
OLAN HORNE He told me that he would be there for me. He would be my best friend. I didn't trust anybody. I didn't trust my parents. I trusted him. It ripped my soul right out from underneath me. 

00:04:05
NARRATOR Olan says that Birmingham preyed on his victims entrapping them into relationships the young boys could not escape. 

00:04:15
OLAN HORNE I remember a day when I realized that Joe Birmingham had been dating me, that all of this mating ritual, the sickness of it. I remember getting physically, violently sick, and, and puking and vomiting into the toilet, just that absolute flashback about it all. 

00:04:30
NARRATOR But as media reports shed light on thousands of pedophile cases in the church, Olan began some research of his own and discovered that he was not the only one abused by Joe Birmingham. 

00:04:40
BERNIE MCDAID I was an altar boy, and the first episode that I recall was in the sacristy after the mass. 

00:04:45
NARRATOR Bernie McDaid was one of Birmingham's earliest victims. 

00:04:50
BERNIE MCDAID He'd come right into the classroom and call you in the guidance room, which was a makeshift guidance room between -- it was a coatroom. And in there he would ask you all sexual questions, force you to answer, grab you and whatnot while the kids are right there in school, and you couldn't jump and run. You just didn't know what the to do, you know, but he was never like. 

00:05:10
NARRATOR When Olan and Bernie's story came out in the local papers, other stories began to unfold. As a result, Olan founded this weekly support group. 

00:05:20
OLAN HORNE It's about a lot of people coming together for a need. 

00:05:20
NARRATOR The men in this group have paid a high price to be here. 

00:05:25
OLAN HORNE Listen, our first sexual experiences happened at the hands of a priest and the sensibility of not wanting it to be public. A pimple at 13 years old is quite disturbing. Can you imagine to understand that you're the man French-kissing a priest? It's been so beneficial because when there's been no hope, there's been some of us there that have had hope. 

00:05:45
OLAN HORNE Get away from my church. This is my church. 

00:05:45
NARRATOR It's a club that represents 30 years of damage under one priest. 

00:05:50
OLAN HORNE Some of us get better some of us don't. Some of us get quicker, quickly healed. Some of us go back and worry about our spirituality. Some worry about the scars to their families. There's a lot to fix here. 

00:06:00
PAUL CIARAMITARO While they're paying for your, uh, for your therapy. 

00:06:05
NARRATOR 31-year-old, Paul Ciaramitaro, is the youngest member and one of Birmingham's last victims. 

00:06:10
PAUL CIARAMITARO That was that she kept on prying and prying. 

00:06:15
PAUL CIARAMITARO He was like a father figure. 

00:06:15
NARRATOR Paul grew up in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where he attended Catholic schools, was an altar boy, and went to mass every week. 

00:06:20
Paul Ciaramitaro 

00:06:20
PAUL CIARAMITARO It was everything that my mom and dad wanted me to do to become a good Catholic student and a, um, and a fine worker. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:30
PAUL CIARAMITARO That turned into a sour, um, a sour turn. 

00:06:35
NARRATOR Like many predators, Birmingham picked his victims because they had a weakness. For Paul, it was his disease, a lymphatic disorder that scarred his face and his self-confidence. 

00:06:45
PAUL CIARAMITARO Joe Birmingham was well-practiced as being a predator. He saw a lot of weaknesses in me and acted like he was going to be my friend to only hurt me. 

00:06:55
NARRATOR When Paul got a job at the church rectory, Birmingham took advantage of Paul's illness. 

00:07:00
PAUL CIARAMITARO The one thing that he said to me one day at work during the afternoon and I had gotten some sun, he says, "Your face don't look good, look too good today." "Ahh," I thought. You know, that was the worst thing he could have said. So, and then five minutes later, he says, "Let's go to a ballgame tomorrow. I got tickets." What does a kid do? "Yeah. Come on, yeah." You know, so, he'd bring you down to bring you up. 

00:07:25
OLAN HORNE I believe unequivocally that he cares about me. He doesn't. 

00:07:40
BERNIE MCDAID I had this feeling this isn't right, but I didn't know how to incorporate it at the time. 

00:07:45
PAUL CIARAMITARO I can remember being cornered in a, a hallway to the backdoor where the pantry was, and he shut the door so it was just me and him. This is something that haunted me and will continue to haunt me. 

00:08:00
NARRATOR Paul says he's still struggling with the anger and the loneliness. Even though he goes to therapy twice a week, he's found little solace except for his walks back in his hometown of Gloucester, Massachusetts. 

00:08:10
PRIMARY focus 

00:08:15
PAUL CIARAMITARO I felt as if I was the only one in the world. 

00:08:20
OLAN HORNE This guy was a con with a collar. 

00:08:20
NARRATOR Olan Horne says that for too long the church has perpetrated criminal behavior of pedophile priests. 

00:08:25
Olan Horne 

00:08:25
OLAN HORNE So, when he arrived, even after being accused and agreeing that he had sexually and inappropriately touched children, was immediately put in charge of taking care of the boys. 

00:08:35
NARRATOR As the leader for Survivors of Joe Birmingham, he hopes that he can get answers to some of their painful questions. 

00:08:45
OLAN HORNE Who is at fault here? Who is more important here? And that's what we heard loud and clear. It was easy to dispose of children. We were like crackers. Little bits of food. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN That's how you feel? 

00:09:00
OLAN HORNE That's how I know I was treated. That's the reality of it. That's the reality of it. That, that isn't how I feel. That is what happened. 

00:09:15
GARY HAYES Unfortunately, the way in which the church dealt with this issue in the past, uh, really based on what many times when adults came to us and asked us to help them, asked us to do so in a confidential environment, and, and, and we respected that request. 

00:09:30
NARRATOR Father Ed Arsenault is the Chancellor for the Diocese of Manchester, New Jersey, neighboring Boston. He says, years ago, the Catholic church didn't publicize abuse cases for the sake of privacy. 

00:09:45
Father Edward Arsenault Chancellor & Secretary for Administration Diocese of Manchester & New Hampshire 

00:09:45
GARY HAYES I think the mistake that we made was that we assumed that the confidentiality of handling these accusations would be helpful. and, while they may have been in individual cases, it contributed to an environment where the community was not able to know that someone who had harmed a child was in their midst. 

00:10:00
DIOCESE OF MANCHESTER 

00:10:00
NARRATOR But for members of the Survivors of Joe Birmingham, the church's appeal to privacy is just another word for "cover-up." 

00:10:10
Bernie McDaid 

00:10:10
BERNIE MCDAID I told my father with three other boys in, in eighth grade what was going on, he took me to a rectory in Danvers, which is a town over from Salem. He confided in a friend, a priest that he was friendly with. He thought that was the way to do this. He didn't want to hurt the church, but he wanted something done for his son. The priest said, "Don't worry. Thank you. We'll get him help." 

00:10:35
NARRATOR But that help never came. Instead, Birmingham was moved from the Salem parish where he was accused to one in Lowell, a town nearly 50 miles away. 

00:10:45
BERNIE MCDAID So, they waited until the ordination term so it would not look like a critical move was being made. And my mother remembers it being so bad she was sitting there when they were giving him cake and ice cream and a party to say goodbye to Father Birmingham, and none of the parish, uh, people knew why he was leaving. 

00:11:00
Paul Ciaramitaro 

00:11:05
PAUL CIARAMITARO The Archdiocese of Boston protected these guys. "These guys" meaning, um, "these abusers." How does, my question is and will always be: How did he slip through? Who is accountable? 

00:11:15
NARRATOR Reverend Arsenault admits that at one time, the church often moved accused priests to new locations. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN The perception is that priests who abused children were moved from church to church and there was a big cover-up. Is, is that a fair description of what happened? 

00:11:30
EDWARD ARSENAULT I don't think it's an accurate perception. In some instances, based on the recommendation of the therapist, a priest was returned to an assignment other than in a parish. Some number of those who returned to non-parish assignments did offend again. 

00:11:45
CAN THE CHURCH BE SAVED? 

00:11:45
NARRATOR But in the case of Joe Birmingham, he was allowed to pass through six churches and is believed to abuse over 100 boys before he left the ministry in 1980 and died in 1988. 

00:12:00
PAUL CIARAMITARO That's the sin of the church. They perpetuated this pedophilia knowingly. You know, we, we have people here who are admitting they have problems. They are admitting them because they're putting them into facilities to take care of the pathology of sexual abuse. Except the church isn't going to do it, and I'm hoping they do. Call me crazy for expecting the moral leaders of a church to be moral. Joe Birmingham never would have had the career that he had had he just been operating on the outside. 

00:12:25
NARRATOR Today, leaders of the Catholic Church say they've learned from their mistakes. 

00:12:30
EDWARD ARSENAULT The painful lesson we've learned is that you cannot supervise or monitor an adult who would harm children. And so, that's why today even one accusation of sexual misconduct with a minor means that a priest will never be assigned in ministry again. 

00:12:40
NARRATOR But for many survivors, the church has done too little too late. 

00:12:45
BARBARA THORP We have to face this evil. We have to face the stark evil of this. 

00:12:50
BARBARA THORP They are just an extraordinary group of men. 

00:12:55
NARRATOR Barbara Thorp is the director for the Office of Healing & Assistance Ministry for the Archdiocese of Boston. 

00:13:00
Barbara Thorp Director, Office of Healing & Assistance Archdiocese of Boston 

00:13:00
BARBARA THORP The church has to take responsibility and has to apologize to validate what happened for the victim/survivor and to listen carefully to what they're telling us about what they need for healing. 

00:13:15
PAUL CIARAMITARO It's not just a Catholic issue. It's about the horrible destruction that happens to children and to, to anybody, anybody in a vulnerable situation. 

00:13:25
NARRATOR Olan Horne is encouraged by Barbara Thorp's ministry, a small step in the right direction, which he believes will bring about healing. 

00:13:30
PRIMARY focus 

00:13:35
PAUL CIARAMITARO This is not about anger. This is not about how you get fixed. This is about a nasty secret, and it's called "sexual abuse" and "predatory sexual abuse." And it ruins and decimates people. It destroys them. It's like a cancer. It exists in our society in big, big numbers. 

00:13:55
BARBARA THORP In the body of Christ, this was a cancer. This was a cancer that was a tumor growing, and we didn't, we didn't know or we were unaware or it, it, it just was, it was underneath. It was hidden. It was secret. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN You heal the sick and the brokenhearted, Lord have mercy. 

00:14:15
NARRATOR Barbara Thorp says that the most devastating effect abuse has had is that in many cases it's robbed victims of their most precious commodity: their faith. 

00:14:25
BARBARA THORP The priests who we entrusted as to be the nurturers of faith and in the case of abuse of a child, it is, it is evil and it is destroying a faith. So, it is the complete opposite of what was the mission in a sense that of, of priests. 

00:14:50
NARRATOR Barbara believes that her Office of Ministry and Healing is only a beginning. Paul Ciaramitaro says that will take a lot more to help him believe in the church once again. 

00:15:00
PAUL CIARAMITARO Somebody asked me the other day, "What religion are you?" I didn't answer the question. "I was raised Catholic." I don't answer the question anymore. I lost my faith, yes. 

00:15:15
NARRATOR Olan Horne says that, even though he doesn't attend church anymore, he still believes in God. 

00:15:20
OLAN HORNE Am I a spiritual guy? Like you wouldn't believe. Great memories of the Catholic Church. I even enjoy some of the symbolism of it, but I have a stark understanding of what it could be. Church didn't do me wrong, hierarchy did. And that's who runs the church. 

00:15:40
Reverend Gary Hayes 

00:15:45
GARY HAYES We just have to understand that, that sometimes bishops, cardinals, priests, ministers, um, nuns, uh, lie, and they're not truthful. And some of them cooperate with evil more than they cooperate with God. 

00:16:05
GARY HAYES This is a letter that I got from, uh, the vocation director of the Diocese of Camden, um. 

00:16:10
NARRATOR While he was in seminary, Hayes confronted his vocation board and told them all that happened between him and his abuser, a priest who's still working at the Archdiocese of Camden. 

00:16:20
GARY HAYES They decided to keep my perpetrator functioning, um, and told me to find someplace else to go. 

00:16:30
NARRATOR So, when Hayes graduated from seminary, he was forced out of one of the largest archdiocese in the country to one of the smallest here in Cloversport, Kentucky. 

00:16:40
GARY HAYES It wasn't a problem with me. It was a problem with them. It was a problem with the system. It was a problem with this, uh, molester. Um, and I could be whoever I wanted to be, and I could do whatever I wanted to do. And so, I asked God to help me do it, and he did. 

00:17:05
GARY HAYES He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God. 

00:17:10
NARRATOR Father Gary Hayes is now serving the church that once wounded him, a church he now knows is far from perfect. 

00:17:15
GARY HAYES Well, there's a desire to protect the image of the institution, to preserve this myth. But the reality is and the truth is that everyone who's in the institution is a sinner. Hello. That's shouldn't, you know, that really shouldn't surprise us. And so, we should, we should be able to talk about it and deal with sin pretty effectively. I think that's what Jesus, that's kind of some of what he told us we should expect. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN Christ has come, Christ has risen, Christ will come. 

00:17:55
NARRATOR Today, Father Hayes says he hopes to put on a new image of the church, one that works not to hide its flaws, but rather to fix and forgive them. 

00:18:00
PRIMARY focus 

00:18:05
GARY HAYES The church as the body of Christ becomes more effective when we stop, um, polishing our image and allow our image to be Christ who needs no polishing. You don't have to fancy up Jesus. You just don't. Um, and Jesus loves me the way I am, and so I don't have to fancy myself up for him either. He knows every bit about me, and he loves me.
