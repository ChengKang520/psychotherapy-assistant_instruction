HARLENE ANDERSON One of the questions has ever present with me in my work is how to invite and sustain the kinds of conversations and relationships that invite us to leave our current thinking boxes and allow us to begin to think and see things differently, all toward being able to access our own creativity and imagination toward unforeseen possibilities those that we couldn’t have imagine before. To respond to this question, I always want to assume what I call a philosophical stance that is a position, an attitude, a tone with which I meet and interact with the other person. Think with them, speak with them, talk with them, respond with them, I think of it as a withness practice or withness way of being with other people influenced by Mikhail Bakhtin’s idea of withness versus aboutness. I have think of it as walking alongside the person or people that I work with and not nudging them from behind or leading them from the front in terms of my determining or having the idea of the direction that they should be going. I think in terms of the focus of our conference in terms of conflict and transformation that these happen within webs of relationships and conversations. And sometimes out of what you might think of is actions of the heart, we inadvertently slip into monolog from dialog. In other words, we slip into sometimes stalemate conversations with ourselves and with others. So I’m going to share a story about some therapist and members of their team that I met a couple of months ago, I was in a South American country doing a workshop and two therapists asked for a consultation. So I invited them to come up and join me in the center of the room and I asked them, if we would spend a few minutes talking what would they hope would come from our conversation from the talking. And they said, we want to know what we could have done differently and what we can do now. So my response to them was, well, if our conversation is going to be helpful to you, what do you think we referring to myself and the participants in the workshop need to know in order to be helpful to you and they began their story like once upon a time. What I learned is that they work in a Foster Family Agency, an agency that recruits and trains foster families for children who had been abandoned and who had either been taken by the courts because they were abused or neglected by their parents. And they wanted to talk about a particular family where the child have been taken from the mother at birth and had only been returned to the mother after a series of legal battles and court actions after two-and-a-half years. So they told me that their work the mother was at a stalemate and that their own team at their agency had advised them to discontinue their work with the family. And they said, they felt in a real loyalty bind, because they felt really committed and caring and concerned and wanted to continue their work with the family yet their team was advising them as they said in very hard to hear words but seemingly logical to discontinue the work with the family. So I – as I said, okay, so what else should we know. So they begin to tell how the mother over the two-and-a-half years when the child was away from her had taken all kinds of legal channel or pursued all kinds of legal channels both locally and nationally to try to get her son back. And in desperation, she turned to what was called a counsel for child and adolescent human rights and justice. This was an agency within the city and which she lived and worked. The counsel reviewed her case and referred it to a state – center, that also work with the same thing around human rights of children and adolescents. They interned ask a international commission on human rights to review the case. The commission reviewed the case and decided to accept it and in their hearing which was and then in the country of Costa Rico because it was an international commission for all of the South American countries, ordered that the child be allowed to have visits with the mother. Well, the state did not follow this international order, so international court ordered the state’s highest attorneys and the mother to appear before them and they also ordered the attorney who was a staff member of this foster care agency to accompany the mother to this international hearing in Costa Rico. At that hearing, the court then ordered that the child be returned to the mother and that the Foster Family Agency offer therapy for the family in effort to assist with the reunification. So enter the two therapist, so they continued their story with how they first met the mother and said that they had been meeting with her and other family members which now included the son who was with her and her father and they met with them on a weekly basis in their home and occasionally in their office. And they focused on talking about how they were living together and helping the mother and the son create a bond with each other. What they then told me was that as soon as the child was returned to the mother that she relentlessly began a series of taking this child to doctors and clinics because he was so frail and very, very small for his age and what the mother described as listless. And the first clinic that she took him to, diagnosed him as autistic. She immediately then began trying to find a cure for his son and also when taking him to all these clinics and doctors to have documentation that she was a good mother doing everything she needed to do and could do to help her son and that they were also be documenting his improvement. The therapist based on their experience with the child and the mother said they did not think this child was autistic had some developmental delays of course. And they felt like the mother’s continued efforts to take this child to all these clinics and doctors was only making the situation worse, in other words it was reinforcing and concretizing this label, this diagnosis that the child had. The mother refused to hear them. She would not stop taking the child to all these clinics and doctors. They also tried to have conversations with her about diagnostic labels and some of the imprisoning affects that they can have on people and how they can intrude with the future as well as influenced by their training in systemic and relational family therapy that the child is not the diagnosis. Well, the mother wouldn’t have any of that, she was convinced the child was autistic and needed all of this care. So at this point that they really felt the work was at a stalemate and their relationship with the mother had just really been terribly destroyed. So I realized that the attorney that they had mentioned who worked with their agency and the agency’s director were in the workshop group, so I asked the two therapist if the attorney and the agency director agree to join us, would that be okay? Well, all agreed. So the attorney and the agency director came to the center of the circle and joined us. I asked them if they would mind sharing some of their inner thoughts, some of their self talk that they had been having with themselves as we had been speaking out loud. The attorney began to speak with lots of emotion and tears in her and saying how intense it was for her to remember the early parts of this story and when she was involved with the mother and with the courts and how much effort it took and also the intenseness of hearing the story over again. The leader then said that the story reminded her of how complex all of the situations that they work with are and the ware and tare and toll that it takes on her staff members not only as professional but as personal human beings and the toll on the team, the agency as a whole and on herself as she tries to lead the crew. And she had been the leader for about 12 years, I think. So I turned back to the two therapist and I asked them kind of where they were now and what they had been thinking and they talked about how they felt that it was really good to talk about this situation that in doing that they felt like they had some companions kind of walking along with them referring to the other participants in the workshop. They felt like they were understood and like they were beginning to think about some things a little bit differently and having some new questions come up in their mind that they hadn’t had before. So what I was doing, I was simply trying to engage with them and what I call a mutual enquiry, learning about their story, trying to understand their perspectives, trying to understand their different perspectives which might have been very seductive for some of the participants thinking, oh, you should have done this or why didn’t you think about this or I can’t believe you did that. And also always willing to have my own values, my own strong opinions questioned and always trying to respond to them in the way that I think of a craftsmen responding to his or her materials that the materials tell those craftsmen what to do, how to respond to it, just as I think our clients tell us how to respond to them. So at this point, the larger group was extremely silent, you could see people dabbing the tears in their eyes, because this were just a very, very emotional story, not only the story content itself, but the emotions that each of these members of this foster family agencies where showing us and sharing us and telling us about and their work with this family. So after a pause, which probably seem to many like a very long pause to help all of us including myself gain our composure. I turned to four of them and I said, would you mind talking with each other while the rest of us listen and share some of the inner thoughts, the inner conversations that you are having with yourself at this point. So they turned and they did so. And then at another point they paused and we were listening and what had begun to emerge was that the two therapist were beginning to have a little bit different inner or self talk. They were now beginning to wonder, would it be possible to meet with the family one more time, not to try to convince the mother of anything, not to try to engage them in therapy, but simply to see if they could heal the broken relationship with her and if they could part with the mother feeling that they really appreciated her, trusted her and respected her. So we paused. Before coming here today, I emailed the four of them and I asked them will they share some of the thoughts or inner conversations that they had been having with themselves since we had met at that time. And they, each of the four emailed me and I’ll share some of their words with you. Okay. One therapist said, when we had the chance to talk with Harlene, I came across several questions I hadn’t asked myself before or perhaps not with such conviction. Having the opportunity to chat and this was her word, to chat about our work maybe if you are less frustrated and it helped me to appreciate our helpfulness with the family. The other therapist, some of her words were, I still wonder as I did on the day when Harlene was there, what else or in what way could we have kept on accompanying Maria and Lucas. It would have not been counterproductive especially for the boy. Once our session with Harlene was over, I could look back and feel that I had been more helpful and that I now believe, I feel much more helpful. Many other questions emerged which I’d guess is the beginning of new voyages. The attorney said, I have the fondest memories of our encounter, I felt appreciated and that our work was confirmed. The leader said, the consultation with Harlene with her careful and kind curiosity allowed me to look and listen from a different angle, an angle in which I felt, understood and impotence generated by the current situation and others like it, taken care of as a leader in the huge challenge of the job that I face, listened to and appreciated. I had new strength and conviction to keep on working not because of the need to find answers of each challenge we face, but instead because of the importance of remaining and seeing these processes through to the end and what we can learn with and she put that capital letters, what we can learn with the families that we work with that will help us do our work better not only with them, but in future ones. So in concluding this story, I suggest that the potential for conflict and transformation lies within invisible webs of relationships and conversations. And even what our intentions are actions of the heart that we can easily slip into monologs with ourself that can invite monological perspectives from other people and we end up with doing monologs almost like skyscraper side by side with no windows, no doors and no bridges, no cross fertilization and no openness to the other. So I think the challenge is always how to restore dialog which is more likely to invite transformation. So what I’d like to invite you to do is to sit there for a moment and think about what was your inner conversation, what were your inner thoughts as I was sharing the story with you.

HARLENE ANDERSON And now I would like for you to turn to your neighbors and share with each other you inner conversations and particularly ideas that you might have about what you might call doing monologs, stalemate conversations, times when you feel yourself trying to get someone to do something that you really think is in their best interest and they just can’t hear you because you haven’t been able to hear them and then I’ll check in with you.
