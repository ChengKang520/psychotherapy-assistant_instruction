TRIANGLE PRODUCTION Presents REMEMBERING GREGORY BATESON A Conversation JAY HALEY and JOHN WEAKLAND Edited by JAY HALEY

00:00:40
JAY HALEY Well here's to Gregory Bateson. 

00:00:45
JOHN WEAKLAND I'll drink to that. 

00:00:45
JAY HALEY To our years with him. Well I thought all we would do is kind of an oral history of Gregory Bateson, who for those are not familiar with him was probably the social scientist of his generation. He was an anthropologist and a biologist to the variety of other categories. He died a few years ago. Our acquaintance with him was in the decade of the 50’s. 

00:01:20
Gregory Bateson Bateson Project 1955 

00:01:20
JAY HALEY He had a project on communication that began in 1952, it ended in 1962. It was called at the times the Double-Bind Project. Out of it came a variety of ideas including the beginnings of family therapy and he was an extraordinary man and I thought we would sit and talk about him, both his ideas and our personal experiences with him. One of the problems in describing him let me just read something here. In this steps to an ecology of mind which was the collection of all his papers at that time. 

00:01:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:01:55
JAY HALEY He says the essays must speak to themselves, but here at the beginning let me state my belief that such matters as the bilateral symmetry of an animal, the patterned arrangement of leaves in a plant, the escalation of an armaments race, the processes of courtship, the nature of play, the grammar of a sentence, the mystery of biological evolution, and the contemporary crisis in man’s relationship to his environment can only be understood in terms of such an ecology of ideas as I propose. 

00:02:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Well that is very large sweeping of statement there. 

00:02:35
JAY HALEY I think that part of the difficulty is anything you and I say about his ideas there's a whole other area that’s we… we don’t say about. We are discussing the particular ones that were important to us because they were part of our responsibility, but he has so many interests and ideas. How did you first meet him? 

00:02:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Well that’s a rather unusual story itself. I had read some of his works even that must have been a matter of partially a chance and I was living in New York. I was thinking about going… I quit my previous work. I was thinking about going back to graduate school something to do with social sciences. I saw Bateson's name in the catalogue of a new school for social research down on 12th street in Greenwich village and on an impulse, I looked in the phone book and his name was there and I called him up which was very out of character for me to do anything as bold as that and I started out by saying, “I'm just a young engineer, but I've read some of your work,” and Bateson said, “Why don’t you come down and see me?” I was totally flabbergasted, but I went down talked with him. I only found out somewhat later that that invitation actually depended on the fact that Gregory that time was a participating in the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics and he thought that I could help him understand the mathematics that the other participants many of them were talking. He was very wrong in that, but nevertheless that was the beginning of my acquaintance with Gregory. Ah… This was the beginning I took a couple the couple of courses in anthropology that he was giving at the new school. I went on from there to do more work in social science in Columbia and then started to work on cultures at a distance. 

00:04:40
JAY HALEY And it was when you were working on that they invited you to be on the project. 

00:04:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes. This was… I had been working on that for several years and I was sort of little loose end. I had known him increasingly well all through those several years and then he invited me ah… in when he got funded in 52 to come out and work in California. 

00:05:05
JAY HALEY I had a similar kind of an experience with him. I was studying popular films and I published the paper the “Appeal of the Moving Picture” in 52 when I was a graduate student and I was going through a degree at Stanford in Mass Communication and then studying films and I wanted to find someone who’d ever analyzed a movie and I heard Gregory had, Gregory Bateson and he was the only one I knew. And it happened, he was in Menlo Park right there at New Stanford, so I called him up and said, “I was analyzing films and I'd like to talk to you about it.” He said, “Come over.” So I came over and he showed me ah… that German propaganda film he'd analyzed, Hitler (inaudible ). 

00:05:57
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:05:57
JAY HALEY And we got in an argument about it. Because I didn't feel he properly appreciated the castration theme in that film. It was a film in which the young man had a knife that was very significant and I was analyzing films from a (inaudible ) metaphor in those days. But anyways… 

00:06:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Well then there have been some changes in your point of view also. 

00:06:20
JAY HALEY A few of those yeah. Well if I was going back to films that’s still a powerful way to interpret films. He and I argued about the importance of that. He was thinking in a different way about films than I was certainly and in more social and less psychological I think. Anyway he then hired me on this project. He was interested in films, you were interested in films and so was I, it was part of our common bond in those days I think. 

00:06:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:06:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Well one thing you said about that project was that there was considerable freedom, but there was no tenure ever. 

00:06:55
JAY HALEY That’s right. We live from year to year with wives and kids. 

00:07:00
JOHN WEAKLAND And that was also true of pretty much Bateson's whole career. 

00:07:05
JAY HALEY That’s true, he never had an official position as a professor anywhere. 

00:07:10
JOHN WEAKLAND He was a Visiting Professor at a lot of places and for a long time but… 

00:07:15
JAY HALEY At Harvard, at Stanford. He was made a regent of (inaudible ) and they wouldn't make him a professor really. 

00:07:21
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. There's a lot of things rather unusual about him. 

00:07:25
JAY HALEY He was a marginal man in the scientific field in the sense he had no great respect for Academia and they didn’t appreciate that I don’t think. But in any way he got that interested in studying Russell and Whiteheads Paradoxes of classification and applied them to communication was his idea. 

00:07:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY And he went to the Rockefeller Foundation thinking it would be very difficult to explain to them what he wanted this grant for, but the head of it was Chester Barnard who understood immediately what he and he said, “Fine, I'll give you the money.” 

00:07:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Well… 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY So he got the grant. 

00:08:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Ah… My understanding of that is that somehow or other somewhere sometime Barnard had come across a copy of Bateson's first major book Navin and Barnard was fascinated by it. Barnard himself was a very unusual man in a business world. A former head of New Jersey Bell and he was a sort of businessman intellectually, he had written a very interesting book called the Functions of the Executive. So Gregory really looked out, he got probably the one foundation man… 

00:08:35
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:08:35
JOHN WEAKLAND …that might have understood what he was talking about. 

00:08:40
JAY HALEY We must say a little about Gregory. What's your understanding of his anthropological background up to that point? 

00:08:45
JOHN WEAKLAND He had had what I would say was probably a fairly conventional grounding in anthropology at least from the British school. I mean he had studied under very important people at Cambridge and of course he came to it out of biology which is a little unusual, but ah… other than that his training was pretty I think standard for that time and he'd been out in the field and pretty much the usual way, but when he got out there he looked at and thought about things differently from the others that have been similarly raised(ph). 

00:09:35
JAY HALEY That’s right. The people counting pottery and counting kinship systems where a different species of anthropologists that he was I think. 

00:09:45
JOHN WEAKLAND I think even at the time I was at the new school, I think that was the time Gregory brought out and showed the class sort of the little handbook that the British anthropological society had put out entitled notes and queries on anthropology and (inaudible ) sort of carried out in the field and look at the series of questions he was supposed to ask to the natives and he was showing it to us is an example of how not to foresee. 

00:10:15
JAY HALEY I think that’s why he was never popular in academia he was doing that sort of thing. He used to… He told me once how he got into anthropology. He said that there was a Greek millionaire who bought a yacht and had a wife and a couple of adolescent daughters and he was going to travel in this yacht and he wanted the scientist who could tell him what kind of fish he was catching, what he caught a fish on these travels, down to the Caribbean. So he went to the British Museum and asked for a scientist, a young scientist to go on the trip and the head of it said there's a young Bateson over there and Bateson was sitting counting the feathers on partridges. He was interested in patterns and comparing two different partridges or something like that. So he was offered this chance so he took it and he went out to see (inaudible ) and ah he was interested in studying the parasites of sharks, he told me. He really wasn’t interested and didn’t know all the fish this guy was catching and so he didn’t know the names of them. So he wasn’t very satisfactory, but what gave him real trouble the Greek had a French wife and these two adolescent daughters and Gregory began to talk to the adolescent daughters about the sexual aspects of fish and of… and of parasites too. This made the Greek most indignant and he fired him and Gregory said that he went back to Cambridge thinking I'd better learn something about people. And so he decided to go into anthropology. That’s how he told me he got into it. He said he hadn’t met a person without a graduate degree till he was 21. This Greek was neutral(ph). 

00:11:55
JOHN WEAKLAND I never heard that story. But it seems to me in many ways very Batesonian(ph). 

00:12:00
JAY HALEY Yeah, it absolutely is. 

00:12:05
JOHN WEAKLAND There's a curios point in that statement until he met the Greek, he hadn’t know anyone about a Graduate degree, so another one of those contradictions. He grew up in an academic… 

00:12:15
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:12:20
JOHN WEAKLAND …an environment as you could possibly imagine a British intellectual academic… 

00:12:25
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:12:25
JOHN WEAKLAND …environment and yet his whole career was to be on the edge of that and never really in it in the sense. 

00:12:30
JAY HALEY Well his father had the first Chair of Biology in Cambridge I guess and was certainly an academician. 

00:12:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah. 

00:12:40
JAY HALEY He was so and I remember Gregory telling me that when he was in school, he public school, he used to take cross country running as part of gym so that he could stop and study the beetles along the way. No one knew that he was studying the beetles instead of running. So he was interested in the classification systems, his father was the evolutionary, scheme of things which was basic. His father created the term Genetics as I remember. So Bateson was in the center of that I think the very beginning. 

00:13:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. Well when he was out running in addition to studying the beetles, he could probably thereby escape from the (inaudible ) competitive games of the English university system which would also be a plus to him. 

00:13:30
JAY HALEY That’s right. He said it was an awful experience going through that school since. I asked him if he put his son through it and he said of course. That if you're of that class you put your son through that even though it’s awful. 

00:13:45
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s curious you know you’ve gotto do the right thing. 

00:13:45
JAY HALEY That’s right. Well anyhow he then went out and he studied the Yatmo in New Guinea. 

00:13:50
New Guinea 1936 

00:13:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY And produced Navin, which was quite an extraordinary work for its time I guess. 

00:14:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yes. 

00:14:00
JAY HALEY It… Well let’s just say a little bit of how it's related to his later ideas. He was examining two rivalries’ clans who escalated almost like an armaments race. 

00:14:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:14:10
JAY HALEY And then they had a ceremony that stopped the escalation so they could start over again. 

00:14:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:14:15
JAY HALEY And he was beginning to study that as a system really like a cybernetic system, very early this was mid-30’s and he wrote this book about it describing that process and that ceremony and it had almost no (inaudible ) he thought it was a very small edition that was ignored. 

00:14:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Well yes, it… very largely was didn’t make any splash ah… I think because he was ahead of where the other anthropologists were asking different sorts of questions. 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY I think so and it’s still holding up. 

00:14:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY The new edition still sells. 

00:15:00
JOHN WEAKLAND He went out there and he saw them doing certain things that interested to him. He couldn’t miss observing what was actually going on, but he didn’t have any way within the conventional frameworks to explain this. So he was… 

00:15:20
JAY HALEY Its hard to believe that now but there wasn’t at that time you know. 

00:15:25
JOHN WEAKLAND That’s right. So he was looking for some sort of theoretical or general framework that will I can make sense of what I see. 

00:15:35
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:15:35
JOHN WEAKLAND And in that respect I think that was characteristic of a great deal of what he did, maybe less so towards the end of his life when he was getting involved increasingly in global sorts of questions. 

00:15:50
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:15:55
JOHN WEAKLAND But certainly for a long-long time and this was one of the things that was most impressive to me. He was always carefully going back and forth between what do you observe, how can you think about it, let’s go back and check with some more observations. 

00:16:10
JAY HALEY Well he had an interesting point of view compared with the rest of a lot of scientists. He argued that you don’t go to the data look at it and come up with the hypothesis and then go back to the data and correct the hypothesis. That’s not a way to produce any fundamental ideas. He argued that you take fundamental ideas and go to the data with them and then you produce some new fundamental ideas or modify the old one. It’s a different process of reasoning about data that he had and it… it made a lot of misunderstanding I think, particularly with psychologists who were sure that you first do the data and then you would get the hypothesis then you experiment, test it and so on. It wasn’t the way he thought or the way he worked. He thought there were fundamental important ideas that had developed by mankind over time and those should be applied and modified and corrected and that you couldn’t get to those by reasoning from data. That’s what he argued. You know there was one of the anecdotes he told me about the experience with the (inaudible ) who were a tribal head hunters pretty, very rough people. 

00:17:21
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:17:21
JAY HALEY And you know well I never saw Gregory really angry, except once in a while he would say, “Oh that’s a bore.” 

00:17:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh that’s that… that… that I remember very well. 

00:17:30
JAY HALEY That… That was his most violent argument. 

00:17:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I always thought that was his code for you're making me mad. 

00:17:40
JAY HALEY That’s right. But he… But he told me once that he didn’t get mad. He was working with the Yatmo and they were building a… a hut which he was very important to because he had photographic equipment and he wanted to protect it. It was out there in the middle of the (inaudible ) with rain, mist and all that. So he needed a place to cover to keep his equipment and they built a platform and they were going to build a house on it, but they got up there and they fooled around and they danced and these guys shouted and they smoked and they they weren’t getting this house built and he was getting more and more angry, because he was gonna… it was gonna cost him his equipment and he was up on the platform and one guy started to tell him some song and story. He said, “You've gotto (inaudible ) house,” and the guy said ho-ho-ho or something and Gregory hit him and he knocked him off this platform about 15 feet down to the ground in the mud and then he looked around and realized he was surrounded by headhunters and he had hit one of their major warriors. So he said… 

00:18:40
JOHN WEAKLAND He could do it because he… one of the thing about him he was big. 

00:18:45
JAY HALEY He was 6"4 and big yeah. So he said he climbed down and he stood there and all these guys were standing around, this guy still lying in the mud looking up at him and he said that he looked and saw his watch was broken by it and he said, “Oh look I broke my watch,” and the guy get up and said, “Oh, that’s too bad,” and (inaudible ) around his broken watch and made a big issue he got passed it. But that was the only time in his life I think that he ever hit anybody or got angry yeah, and that was over scientific equipment. But anyway he met Margaret Mead out there at one point. 

00:19:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:20
JAY HALEY They got married they then went to Bali and did one of the extraordinary works of photographic analysis which was new in anthropology at that time. 

00:19:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yes. I don’t even think it’s ever been duplicated. 

00:19:35
JAY HALEY No and the films are particularly interesting. 

00:19:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… Yeah. Gregory while in that's just one example in many ways he looked sort of both in style and appearance and everything he looked sort of lose shambling casual. He could be very precise and very detailed where he thought it was important. 

00:20:00
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:20:05
JOHN WEAKLAND He for example when they were in Bali, he cleaned the lands (inaudible ) tissue with his own back pocket handkerchief but he took thousands upon thousands of films, thousands of shots. Maybe there is two hundred in the book, but there were more likely 20,000… 

00:20:30
1937 

00:20:35
JOHN WEAKLAND …when they came home, plus a great deal of film. They shot lots of stills and lots of movie film. 

00:20:40
JAY HALEY And they tried to complete record of their culture then really. 

00:20:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Ah they were doing something in great detail. 

00:20:50
JAY HALEY Yeah. He had a very productive collaboration and were married for quite a while. 

00:20:55
JOHN WEAKLAND They were still married when I first met Gregory and all the things were on the way down and out about them. 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY But you must have known Margaret as well as him. 

00:21:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah, I knew Margaret quite well. I… I met Margaret with (inaudible ) six months or a year after I first met Gregory, but then this study of cultures at a distance project began and was mainly run by Ruth Benedict, but Margaret was the number 2 and Margaret took it over after Ruth died. So, I knew her quite well. 

00:21:30
JAY HALEY You know she told me something interesting once. She said that Bateson thought at very abstract levels or very specific levels and her function was to fill in the middle ground and she said she thought I was getting into that position of filling into the middle ground for Gregory because he had problems with the middle. 

00:21:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:50
JAY HALEY He was great on the abstract… 

00:21:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:50
JAY HALEY …and wonderful on the specific details of an incident. 

00:21:55
JOHN WEAKLAND With that I would agree with that. 

00:21:55
JAY HALEY Yeah. And she was a more middle ground person that’s why she's a more popular an anthropologist. 

00:22:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… yeah. She was much easier to follow than he was. 

00:22:10
JAY HALEY That’s right. He was a difficult man to follow. 

00:22:15
JOHN WEAKLAND I mean when he was on the high level he was too high up for many people. When he was looking at the details, many people would look at that it in terms of what he being so picky with all those observations. Why he's making so much point to that? 

00:22:30
JAY HALEY That's right. Went from up specific observation to a fundamental law of human thinking in one step really. Well he came out to California and went to work with Ruesch at Langley-Porter Clinic must have had a grant of some kind. In 1949 or so and that’s where he got interested in psychiatry I gather. Up to that time I don’t believe he'd been particularly involved. 

00:22:55
JOHN WEAKLAND I don’t think he had. There was may be some fringe involvement since by that period, there were some anthropological playing around with mainly (inaudible ) views, but I don’t think he had been particularly concerned with it. 

00:23:20
JAY HALEY They wrote that book Communication of Social Matrix of Psychiatry which is probably one of the best books of fundamentals of Bateson's thinking I think really. He wrote the psychiatry and Ruesch wrote the anthropology in the book. 

00:23:35
JOHN WEAKLAND (inaudible very-very different. 

00:23:40
JAY HALEY Extraordinarily different man for… for getting together and writing each a half a book you know. But then he got his grant and came to the VA hospital. 

00:23:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh he came to VA. 

00:23:50
JAY HALEY And then got his grant. 

00:23:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Then got his grant. 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:23:55
JOHN WEAKLAND I think Ruesch was of some help in getting the position established at VA. 

00:24:00
JAY HALEY You know what I heard about that. I think I might have heard of (inaudible ) was that the reason VA had an ethnologist which is the government word for anthropologist was because an anthropologist visited the VA hospital down near Los Angeles and found an Indian in there who was normal as far the anthropology, he was just behaving like an Indian. He'd gotten drunk and got in trouble and he came in and he was mute, he wouldn’t talk or whatever and this guy knew that tribe and knew that guy was behave that way. So he said that there's nothing wrong with this man and they began to think about with all the different cultures in VA hospitals may be they should have somebody who knew who (inaudible ). So they hired two; one down in LA and Gregory was the other one as I understand and he at the Menlo Park VA Hospital, his task was to deal with the different cultures and there weren't many there. He had one Japanese I remember with primarily they were Irish and that’s how he got into alcoholism was because so many of them drank. So that his interest in alcoholism came out of his duties at the VA of dealing with the special ethnic groups. 

00:25:15
JOHN WEAKLAND But I suspect it also with that job and with almost any other we ever had whatever the job definition Gregory modified it considerably and fact. 

00:25:30
JAY HALEY He did in his own life for sure. Remember what he used to talk about the three umbrellas. He wanted to work with freedom and he got freedom by having more bureaucracy. That’s what he said. So that he had… he was at the VA on a grant from a foundation who gave the money to Stanford. So that the granting people thought Stanford was supervising and Stanford thought the VA was supervising and the VA thought Stanford was supervising, nobody was supervising Gregory could do what he pleased. 

00:26:00
JOHN WEAKLAND And he was… he was very aware of this. Very pleased with this and yet this is also the man who in many contexts warned us about power influence and manipulation. 

00:26:15
JAY HALEY And he was very skillful at it and very interested in it in his anthropological work. 

00:26:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:25
JAY HALEY He ah… his interest in hierarchy goes way back to the Balinese speaking a different dialect to the people above them and below them. 

00:26:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:35
JAY HALEY As well as his interest in the fact that the Balinese Gods were children, not parental figures which as he used to put it that turned everything upside down. He liked that phrase that people were dealing with Gods who were playful and children and child-like. So he was very interested in the hierarchical situation. Though it took quite a while for us to get into that in family therapy to think hierarchical. 

00:27:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:27:00
JAY HALEY We thought of it in broader terms in the family I think. Well there was another thing he did. I remember to talk about how the VA tried to handle it. He had to answer to a research committee at the VA who didn’t know what to think of him. But I remember he decided he was going to study octopuses Octopi and that he was going to crack a mammals code and that possibly could deal with the Octopi. So he wanted to put them in tanks and study. So he asked the research committee at the VA if he could use the morgue to hold his… 

00:27:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah… 

00:27:40
JAY HALEY …to hold his achieve tanks because there weren't very often anybody in the morgue (inaudible ) people didn’t die that come in. And so the research committee considered this and they couldn’t figure out what he was doing where’s he got octopuses to put the first place and they didn’t feel quite right about having them in the morgue. But at the same time they couldn’t object because maybe it was important. They didn’t know what was important and what wasn’t. So they finally agreed and he put them in the morgue. Then he… 

00:28:10
JOHN WEAKLAND These days (inaudible ) have to go before human soldiers (inaudible ) never get out of there. 

00:28:15
JAY HALEY That’s probably something. And he then put them in the morgue and then he goes sit in the morgue he was bored to death sitting there, so he began to put them in his living room, so he can watch them at home and then made the change. But I remember that committee decision, they had a real problem with that and I think they always had a problem with Gregory. They couldn't quite figure what the hospital acknowledges was doing with all these investigations of animals of various kind, the otters in the zoo, monkey's and all this. And he always behaves like this everybody would know this was a widely important project studying octopi. This problem with him is they had eight legs and changed color, the communication was very complex with the Octopi. So he would often study it often. So he got that grant (inaudible ) brought you and I and we… when I spent the first two years trying to figure out what the project was about as I remember it. 

00:29:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Well my recollection is that at least once a week meetings over coffee in the morning we would raise that question, “Gregory, what is this project all about? 

00:29:15
JAY HALEY And he would answer us, sort of. 

00:29:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Well it must have been sort off ah… we wouldn't have been asking it again the next week. 

00:29:25
JAY HALEY But we're trying to find out first what the paradoxes were and then to figure out… 

00:29:30
JOHN WEAKLAND As I remember the official title for the Rockefeller was the study of paradoxes of abstraction in the role of paradoxes of abstraction in human communication. Ah… I mean it sounds good but it doesn’t sound too awfully clear. 

00:29:55
JAY HALEY We were with him 40 hours a week for 10 years which is probably a record for any research practice. You and I were full time. 

00:30:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:05
JAY HALEY Bill Fry was there part time, Don Jackson was there part time psychiatric consultant, usually half a day a week, but you and I had 40 hours a week trying to figure out what we were investigating. 

00:30:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:15
JAY HALEY And that beginning to… first of all the (inaudible ) Paradoxes that once from the Greeks, once we understood he was partly talking about those like if a man says, “I'm lying,” is he telling the truth? We then got into the question, how could you apply this to human beings? 

00:30:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:35
JAY HALEY Interchanging and he said well, it’s obvious you know. He was often saying it was obvious. But if you think about that period, you know in those 10 years the first four years we published two papers one the… on that trip to Mexico I made in 54. 

00:30:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY One in 56. So that the first three or four years of project we hardly published at all. From 56 to 62 we published 70 publications. So the ideas just began to come out in print at the middle of that project. 

00:31:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Well maybe we were getting our feet on the ground even when we were still asking what ground is it? 

00:31:15
JAY HALEY That’s right. We must have ultimately figured out that what I began to do and I think you did too was because it wasn’t clear what this project is about and it was about everything since it was about communication. We began to go and look at whatever interested us which is was a tremendous freedom for 10 years to investigate anything that interested was really the position we had. 

00:31:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Things were never tightly nailed down, but equally there was a lot of room to move around. 

00:31:45
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:31:45
JOHN WEAKLAND And the fact that we were allowed to look here and there also the fact that’s why Gregory dealt with things himself. 

00:31:55
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:32:00
JOHN WEAKLAND He was studying communication and to him it was relevant to go watch both the otters and the monkeys in the zoo. It was relevant to go watch how they trained the eye(ph) dogs with blind in (inaudible ). How does the trainer communicate with the dog and teach him things. It was even relevant to go and observe and talk to that proctologist in San Francisco (inaudible ). 

00:32:31
JAY HALEY We dealt with all the non-verbal behavior that (inaudible ) brought to the project. 

00:32:36
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:32:36
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) who was the authority on body rhythm and we also dealt with all the vocal intonation that the linguist(ph) and Paul Moses(ph) could bring to the project too. Because everything was relevant to communication really. But Bateson was interested in animal communication hoping that there would be fundamental ideas in that that would be simpler than the complex ideas of humans and his primary interest was in animals communicating about communication simulating communication and also he discovered with animal play that they had to know a message was a message in order to play, that this was a bite of play and not a bite of combat, was to him a major idea that he got into in that paper on play. And he went up and filmed those otters and then I had to present that film with grave doubts about the validity of it I remember that. 

00:33:35
JOHN WEAKLAND You mean you weren't totally convinced that it was psychotherapy to have a piece of paper on a string and dangle it in front of them. 

00:33:45
JAY HALEY Well what happened is he went up there to film monkeys of the monkey island and nearly very few ecologists were doing that (inaudible ). And he then began… he discovered these otters down in this (inaudible ) sea otters, the river otters. 

00:34:02
JOHN WEAKLAND River otters. 

00:34:02
JAY HALEY River otters, and they were unhappy otters, there were two of them who didn’t play and they just sat around and moped. So he dangled some food on a string as I remember. 

00:34:15
JOHN WEAKLAND I think he dangled food and that didn’t do anything. 

00:34:15
JAY HALEY That’s right. Then he dangled some balloons and they began to chase the balloons and they began to play and run around the place more cheerfully and he came back the next week and there they were and like this so pleased them. He taught them to play with these balloons and so he had this film and he presented it in terms of the theory of… of this… of the balloons representing food but not being food that was a paradoxical thing. 

00:34:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:34:45
JAY HALEY And I recall we suggesting that perhaps the otters might have begun to play because it was spring. He said that isn’t it, they played because of those balloons. So we said well maybe its there's alternate periods with otters that they play or don’t play or maybe they… you know they're in there all week and you only see them for a little while maybe something happened during the week that you don’t know about. No, it was this. He made that film and then what was the problem for me was he was supposed to go to Mexico to that regional psychiatric meeting. 

00:35:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:35:20
JAY HALEY That included very prominent people like Erich Fromm and so on. And I… he couldn’t go for maybe immigration reasons and asked me to go and I'd been on the project what six months and this was 54, a year and we didn’t have much really and I had to get on there and talk for three hours to that group and he wanted me to pass out this paper and to show this film and I said, “Gregory, I'll have trouble defending this film, but I'll certainly show it and do the best I can,” you know and then I went down there and I wrote what I was going to say on the plane you know and that from then on I was never scared of speaking in public. That’s true. I got passed with that. I talked for three hours at that meeting answered difficult questions. 

00:36:05
JOHN WEAKLAND So you knew that you can do anything. 

00:36:10
JAY HALEY About movies, about therapy. We studied John Rosen by then and about these otters and their… and about play and we got passed with that. But I remember that film and they liked it but really what they got off on dreams and that occupied them a lot. So I didn’t have to say so much I remember. But Gregory was pleased with that he is still pleased with that film. I mean he was in his last writings. 

00:36:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… 

00:36:40
JAY HALEY So it was important to him. I… I remembered Gregory as going around in that old woody station wagon holding(ph) cameras or tape recorders. He had a tape recorder that we used to take to Erickson that was 3feet x 4feet or something. 

00:36:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Supposedly portable and took two men to lift. 

00:37:00
JAY HALEY It was called portable right with big handles on each end. 

00:37:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Must have weighed 50 pounds. 

00:37:00
JAY HALEY Yeah. And Bateson was always carrying some heavy equipment and he was in that old wood that station wagon with the wooden signs and he took care of it like he took care of himself you know. He… I remember that’s the only station wagon that had termites. It really did. It was a mess that car, but it had his equipment and that’s what his purpose was to cart him here and there without equipment. 

00:37:30
1951 

00:37:30
JAY HALEY He was a great believer in recording data. 

00:37:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:37:35
JAY HALEY Not just writing it down, but having it on a… on a record of some kind audio film or whatever and we filmed a bit even when that was so expensive. 

00:37:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. We got the raw materials you can go back to it and you can never be totally unselective, but if you take a film or a tape you do a lot less selection than if you are making a few notes. 

00:38:00
JAY HALEY That’s right. He got that grant for two years from the Rockefeller Foundation. There's an interesting way of thinking about the collaboration between a person's personal life and their research ideas that I think came out at that time. I recall when ah… that grant was running out and we hadn’t accomplished much of anything, in the way of… of what he had hoped, in the way of laying out the paradoxes of abstraction and communication and we had just begun to talk to a schizophrenic and get interested in his confusion of communication, but in any right(ph) Bateson went back to ask for a renew of that grant and he was sure he'd been turned down because Chester Barnard was gone and he'd have to deal with the committee who wouldn’t know what he was talking of. 

00:38:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:38:55
JAY HALEY So he didn't wanna go, but he went back and he presented and the committee turned him down as he knew they would and that’s when he came back and wrote that letter to Norbert Wiener. 

00:39:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:39:05
JAY HALEY Which said the cause of schizophrenia is being punished for expecting punishment and I think it came absolutely out of that experience where he went back expecting to be turned down and was turned down. It coincided exactly you know. I mean he wrote that within a week to Weiner when he got back. So then we decided to go into the study of schizophrenia partly because there was a chance of some money in it compared with the abstract idea of paradoxes. 

00:39:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:39:35
JAY HALEY And we wrote a grant proposal, was pretty good grant proposal I remember it and the foundations fund (inaudible ) 

00:39:46
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah, Foundations fund I think. 

00:39:46
JAY HALEY (inaudible ), now we got two more years. Bateson, he was such an admirer of Weiner and I remember Weiner came out we met him. 

00:39:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yes. 

00:39:55
JAY HALEY He was a quick guy. As soon as Gregory talked to him about the confusion of logical types in schizophrenic discourse immediately Weiner saw it. But you know one of things that happened at that time and I'm sure you remember this is we got this grant to study this process of he put in the grant that a schizophrenic was caused by his parents punishing for expecting punishment. As when the kid does something wrong they punish him, the next time the kid (inaudible ) when they come near and they get indignant at that because they don’t like that impression. So they punish him for expecting them to punish him. 

00:40:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:40:40
JAY HALEY And we said to Gregory we got the grant two years to study this and document it. So we said to Gregory how do you know this happens? And he said it happens. So I said we have no data from childhood that this happens from parents of schizophrenics and their children. He said it happens. So we said how could it, how do you know it happens? Then we then went up to the mountains remember? 

00:41:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:05
JAY HALEY We went up to the (inaudible ) we went into (inaudible ) and the three of us… 

00:41:10
JOHN WEAKLAND (inaudible ) 

00:41:12
JAY HALEY We spent two full days in that cabin arguing and laying up the two years of work that we had ahead of us on this grant and trying to find out what on earth he was talking about and I remember at some point there he said when we said how do you know that parents punish the kid for expecting punishment. He said that’s the sort of thing that has to happen or he wouldn’t have a confusion in his communication and learning and we said that sort of thing and then it became clear to us somehow I remember that. From then on it was easy. We chatted about all the different possibilities of that sort of thing and that was where the double bind came from. 

00:41:50
JOHN WEAKLAND I think that sort of had some connection with Gregory was always thinking about patterns. 

00:42:00
JAY HALEY Yeah, oh absolutely. 

00:42:00
JOHN WEAKLAND And in that sense it’s not as wild as it looks at first. 

00:42:05
JAY HALEY That’s right. You know people listen to Gregory and they find that very interesting, but there's not a practical consequence. We had a practical consequence at that time. If we couldn't clarify what he was talking about we had two years of confusion ahead of us. 

00:42:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:20
JAY HALEY Because we had build a project on something called the double bind which we had no evidence for and no data on and which he had this one example and it took… I mean how obscure he could be he realized when two reasonably intelligent people like us had to spend two days and it was a day and a half before we got that issue cleared. 

00:42:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:40
JAY HALEY It was the last day, the last afternoon as I remember. We understood what he was talking about finally with a lot of discussion. Top patterns in… he in fact he has a paper titled the Patterns that Connect, because he saw the patterns connecting in all kinds of situations and he really was more of a biologist than he was an anthropologist. He doesn’t give examples from different humans tribes. He gives examples of different species of animals. He… the puppies, the cats, the crawfish, the crabs. His interest is in the variety of evolutionary patterns really. He wanted to make his contribution in evolutionary theory and I don’t think he didn’t do. He had hopes of the double bind doing that I think because he was interested in how that idea could be applied to the process of evolution. Such as an animal adapting to an environment then the environment changing and there was the animal caught in a paradoxical situation because his whole adaptation was now inappropriate. Those kinds of ideas he was playing with. 

00:43:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I don’t have background in evolutionary theory to judge it, but it does strike me that he may have left a mark in his emphasis on things evolved together the environment and the inhabitance of the environment. 

00:44:15
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:44:15
JOHN WEAKLAND That the example in that book. It’s not just a horse evolved because of grassy plains, but grassy plains lead the horse running around as much as the other way. 

00:44:30
JAY HALEY He believed that what was changing was the syntax of language about science that… that an elephant has a nose that you call a nose not because it looks like a nose but because it's between two eyes and above the mouth and therefore it’s a nose. Everything is in relation to somebody something else now and because it’s in relation to something else, it requires a language of relationships rather than a language of discrete items was the way he was thinking and he was trying to introduce that language. 

00:45:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:00
JAY HALEY And really that’s how we got into the language of interpersonal relations and of families in terms of psychopathology. You know what are the things we might deal with this therapy and Bateson, because this such a curious thing happening that that he's becoming the central figure in family therapy by as a number of people say and he was a man who was an anthropologist just who was so really-really didn’t believe in changing people. 

00:45:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah, that’s true. 

00:45:35
JAY HALEY And he… he didn’t have a theory of change in therapy at all or and was not interested in developing one. He was willing to have his project investigate therapy, because I think he thought it was an important topic, but he himself had little enthusiasm for it. But there's stuff like this a book on the Malayan group which says ah… that at last the therapy has come along its really Batesonian(ph) therapy. Apparently it’s because of being neutral or something and he was being neutral. Well let me. 

00:46:10
JOHN WEAKLAND I have some questions even about the concept… 

00:46:15
JAY HALEY Absolutely. 

00:46:15
JOHN WEAKLAND He had turned out that he was remembered more as the founder of family therapy and the speaker on evolution and ecology, I'm afraid that wouldn’t set to well with him. 

00:46:30
JAY HALEY Oh, he would think that was all (inaudible ) that was what he was remembered for that’s right. I mean he was interested in profound subjects and he did not consider that a profound subject. That was just a variation on other therapy. 

00:46:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… yeah. 

00:46:45
JAY HALEY I mean the revolutionary nature of family therapy he understood, but he wasn’t interested in it. If it had been a form of communication with a mammal that would have been far more important than that with another mammal. It irritates me because they… they pull up a statement he made about power in relation to me. Its 15 years after the project was over or whenever in which he said that the myth of power corrupts or something like that and that one sentence is taken as his statement about therapy and his relation. It implies that he and I had some conflict. God we had 10 years talking about therapy, we must have had 50,000 conversations about therapy and we investigated different therapists. I can't remember a single critical comment of you or I in the therapy we were doing and that he was filming and recording about manipulation or indirectness or power or in all those years I can’t remember that and yet that’s how it’s thought of now. 

00:47:55
JOHN WEAKLAND I don’t have any recollection of that either. 

00:48:00
JAY HALEY Then we investigated interestingly enough and he organized it, even approved it. We investigated the two most therapists most concerned with power. The two more the therapists most concerned with power in that decade was John Rosen. 

00:48:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:20
JAY HALEY And Milton Erickson. 

00:48:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:48:20
JAY HALEY And those were the central people he studied and was interested in them. You remember that first visit to Rosen? 

00:48:30
JOHN WEAKLAND We went to Pennsylvania. 

00:48:30
JAY HALEY Right. 

00:48:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah I remember some of it at least. 

00:48:35
JAY HALEY There was a meeting on one of the Georgia Islands of people who were working with schizophrenics and Bateson went to that, met Rosen, came back to his place to research him really and called us to come and we met him there in Pennsylvania. 

00:48:50
John Rosen, MD 1955 

00:48:50
JAY HALEY Rosen at that time was a man working with psychotics by putting them in… in individual houses with the young couple who took care of them 24 hours a day. 

00:49:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:49:00
JAY HALEY And then he would make his rounds going from house to house. He had previously kept him in his own house. But we then visited him there and went from house to house with him and as an example of and interested power remember that patient called Little Guy who said he was going to fuck his mother and Rosen said he wasn’t allowed to fuck his mother and he said well he was going to do it in Europe, he wasn’t going to do it in the United States. So we visited this house and the guy said he was God and Rosen was anticipated and all of us were in this room. I've got the audio tape of this somewhere and ah… Rosen says to the guy you can't fuck your mother you have to do what I say and the guy said, “I don’t have to do what you say,” and Rosen said, “Don’t you know who is God?” The guy said, “I'm God.” 

00:50:00
JOHN WEAKLAND (inaudible ) 

00:50:01
JAY HALEY Show who is God boys? And this little guy five foot tall he has four big football players put down on his knees in front of Rosen, and Rosen then says who is God? And the guy says I'm God and Rosen says why don’t you get up then and the guy says tell him to get away. So Rosen says everybody get away (inaudible ) and the guy says oh I should have obliterated him and the laughter of everybody in that room and you hear Bateson roaring of laughter and you can’t have a more power (inaudible ) in relation to therapy than the therapists forcing a guy on his knees. 

00:50:35
JOHN WEAKLAND (inaudible ) 

00:50:36
JAY HALEY That’s right. That was so funny really and Rosen said, “Come back next year and you'll find this guy okay,” and by God Bateson went back next year and he was okay. Now Rosen was a subject of interest to Bateson for a variety of reasons, but he certainly was not turned off by his power of maneuvers at all. 

00:50:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Gregory Bateson was not a man without ambivalent or conflicting 

00:51:00
JAY HALEY That’s true. 

00:51:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Stances, views. Well I think it’s clear that Gregory was more uneasy about Erickson than he was about Rosen. 

00:51:15
JAY HALEY That’s right. That’s right. You remember that one where he explored the periphery of trance with him? 

00:51:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah. Bateson in one of his previous contacts with Erickson (inaudible ) come up about too well as he always did with Erickson how about little trance for you? And Bateson said well, “No-no, I don’t really want to get into it. I'm just sort of interested in exploring around the periphery of it,” and so Erickson said, “Oh, why don't you just look at your hand and especially sort off here around the edges and of course the edges of the periphery.” 

00:52:05
JAY HALEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:52:05
JOHN WEAKLAND And he went on a while there and I gathered that Erickson had put Gregory Bateson into a pretty good trance just by talking about the edges and the periphery. 

00:52:15
JAY HALEY Ever you being marginal I think. 

00:52:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. A beautiful example now I come to think of it was that basic principle and accept and utilize what subject offers you. 

00:52:30
JAY HALEY Sure. Oh that’s how he did it every time you know and he went just as far as Bateson was willing to go with it, I'm sure, extending it a little maybe. 

00:52:40
JOHN WEAKLAND But he haven’t gone much further with Bateson than Bateson was willing to go anyway. 

00:52:45
JAY HALEY That’s right. That's true. 

00:52:45
JOHN WEAKLAND He may have been concerned about power, but I have never seen anybody pushing very far beyond… 

00:52:50
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:52:55
JOHN WEAKLAND …where he thought that was enough. 

00:52:55
JAY HALEY That’s right. He was ah… He was a man who would take a position. 

00:53:00
JOHN WEAKLAND We covered a lot of territory. 

00:53:05
JAY HALEY Oh yes. Well there was probably no other project of three people devoting full time to investigations, recording, interviews with therapists. I mean we covered quite a number of therapists and put a lot of thought on human relations as… as a group there. I mean that was an exceptional thing happening. Other people were busy with their practices or teachings or whatever we were primarily focused on these ideas. 

00:53:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:40
JAY HALEY You remember the… you and I in 53 were working out for something to do took that course and Alan Watts he was then Head of the Academy of Asian studies. 

00:53:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:50
JAY HALEY And we took the course on the relationship between eastern philosophy and western psychiatry. 

00:53:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:53:55
JAY HALEY And I remember that first night Alan talked for three hours without a nope and everything he said was interesting. It was an extraordinary lecture he gave a little group there and was there and out of that came our interest in (inaudible ) I think which at that time was the only ideology (inaudible ) that was a counter(ph) to psychodynamic theory. If you were into psychodynamics (inaudible ) anything I mean there wasn’t even learning theory in those early 50s and the behavioral (inaudible ). And the idea of (inaudible ) there were the tradition of 700 years and one person trying to change another and what they were trying to do and their assumptions about change being sudden and paradoxical. 

00:54:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:45
JAY HALEY That whole set of ideas. Watts had one subject which was paradoxical and he was very good on that subject, but he had a really a powerful influence on that in those early days because at that point we began to look at therapy and we were looking for different framework and there it was really. 

00:54:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:00
JAY HALEY And that was paradoxical which was what our project was about. We always enjoyed Watts particularly in those early days. 

00:55:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:10
JAY HALEY Before he became a (inaudible ). Kind of everybody keeps becoming (inaudible ). There were three major areas; psychiatry, and hypnosis, and therapy as well as animal behavior evolution and so on. And Bateson was not an enthusiast for… for much of psychiatry and for hypnosis and for therapy really and yet that’s what his project centered on. 

00:55:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:35
JAY HALEY But his interest in his idea of therapy was he was really a (inaudible ) he had some (inaudible ) therapy himself. He liked that… that humanistic way of being really. 

00:55:45
JOHN WEAKLAND I think it also fits the lets connect this in details with the very large scale. 

00:55:55
JAY HALEY I know. Tried to collective unconscious in this detail, yeah. But I remember him working with those alcoholics and ah… like that guy who lived up on the hills there. I mean Bateson went and saved him when he was drunk and brought him in and was very concerned about him and I mean he really extended himself personally with each of those patients. 

00:56:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah, yeah. 

00:56:20
JAY HALEY It wasn’t that he stayed off abstractly with them although he did a lot of lecturing them because he thought you shouldn't change people indirectly apparently. Boy, I don’t know what he thought really. But he used to lecture Smithy(ph) a lot I think. 

00:56:35
JOHN WEAKLAND It’s as if… if you really treated Smithy(ph) so that he did not talk and behaved in such a crazy way, you would reduce him somehow. 

00:56:50
JAY HALEY There was some of that, yeah. 

00:56:55
JOHN WEAKLAND You would… It’s as if you would take the poetry out of his life. 

00:57:00
JAY HALEY Well you know there… there's always those two extremes with schizophrenia; one is that they are geniuses and extraordinary and the other is that they're just handicap people. 

00:57:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:10
JAY HALEY And we oscillated between those (inaudible ) there was a… a spiritual idea of schizophrenia that was in the world still, yes really. I think we ended up more with them as failures in our view. But there was a period where they were admired and… and Bateson would call Smithy(ph) by the hour when Smithy(ph) says I'm a male man and Bateson realized he was talking about masculinity as well as delivering a message. 

00:57:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:57:40
JAY HALEY Bateson was fascinated by it. 

00:57:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah and I think Bateson would have felt a significant loss if Smithy(ph) got to where he was behaving in such a way that he's both more simply (inaudible ). 

00:57:56
JAY HALEY That’s right. But Bateson was also very anti-parent certainly anti-Smithy's parents. 

00:58:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah yeah. 

00:58:00
JAY HALEY He went there and came back and described that house. I mean he was on the side of Smithy(ph) against those parents and I think we all were at that time to some extent, but he was more. 

00:58:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah, but I think my… could been a good deal to change. 

00:58:15
JAY HALEY Oh I think that yeah. 

00:58:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Bateson was so anti-parental that I think despite all his emphasis on into the relation, he never really got to the view that even in a family like that they're all in it together. 

00:58:30
JAY HALEY That’s right. He tried… He tried to make the parents the victim of the patient too, but he… he couldn’t make it really. It was reciprocal, but not in really one direction. 

00:58:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

00:58:45
JAY HALEY And I think ah… you and I or at least I know I have… have reversed myself from being joining the patient against the parents to joining the parents against the patients. 

00:58:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh yeah, so have I. 

00:58:55
JAY HALEY And that’s the correct hierarchically way to… way to go. I think part of our struggle with hierarchy was a problem of having a hierarchical view when you have an anti-parent bias, because you are above the parents as an expert and you gotto join them to deal with the kid and its hard if you are already joining the kid. But everybody was I mean in those day we were just doing something new for the first time and exploring it. I remember that first patient I saw with his parents, we didn’t even define it is family therapy and he stood against the wall scared to death of them and ah… I can remember struggling to think about how do I talk to him and them. How do you do that because nobody had done it. 

00:59:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

00:59:45
JAY HALEY But you know the big step that we took and Bateson took which was a hard step it seems easy now perhaps, but we considered the two-three years the double bind as an (inaudible ) that it was something that happened in the history of the kid in the childhood and that that the adults schizophrenic was a walking scar of that in some way. It was when we brought a family together with the patient that for the first time we saw that this could be considered currently instigated. 

01:00:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:00:20
JAY HALEY Or currently reversed and that was a tremendous idea. 

01:00:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:00:25
JAY HALEY And that was a new idea in the world really at that time in psychiatry or therapy because everybody was focused on the past and the programming of the past and that began this family therapy idea that symptoms are appropriate adaptive behavior rather than irrational maladaptive behavior. But to do that you had to look at the current situation. 

01:00:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah (inaudible ) just what happened in the past that is governing the present even though it’s very unclear how that could actually take place. 

01:01:00
JAY HALEY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:00
JOHN WEAKLAND What is the mechanism that the past if it’s really past can govern the present. 

01:01:05
JAY HALEY Well it’s like now people are beginning to argue that phobias don’t have a past trauma as the cause, but to accept that idea means such a readjustment in your thinking because everybody has always said some past trauma causes the present phobia. The idea that it has a current function (inaudible ), but I don’t think Bateson had any problem making that shift which is curious you know. I mean he was the one who laid this out as a punishment for expecting punishment in childhood and then began to work with adult schizophrenics as adaptive behavior for the current situation, granted an anti-parent bias, but I don’t remember him struggling with that problem or trying to take us back to childhood or something like that. Like many people were still struggling to get back to childhood and those ideas. 

01:01:55
JOHN WEAKLAND I don’t remember very clearly about that one way or the other. 

01:02:00
JAY HALEY I think it was his anthropological training, that the current social situation was a powerful… he wasn’t an archeologist in that sense in anthropology. 

01:02:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:02:10
JAY HALEY And it must have helped in that situation. But we began to see families and I began to be family therapy 56 or 57 and we didn’t get a grant until you got that. You began to head the family therapy grant in 59 I think it was. But during that period Bateson was seeing families, we were both seeing families and Jackson was having his influence on that. 

01:02:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:02:40
JAY HALEY He was seeing some families then as practice, but it isn’t like we were saying this is a whole new deal, it was sort of like a developmental process in some way. Until outsiders came and then they were saying what were you doing sitting down with the whole family and (inaudible ) one way. 

01:03:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Well they sure said that time you and I went to Chicago and we played what I would now think of as a couple of very mild tapes and you're talking there with the patient in the family. 

01:03:15
JAY HALEY She had forgotten that. 

01:03:15
JOHN WEAKLAND I do recall one thing now that I was thinking about earlier. The fair business about power and you see it in steps to in ecology of mind every now and then and more in some ways like books is concerned about doing things purposively and how it is likely to get out of hand very well I think time went on he saw it getting out of hand very rapidly. I can understand the argument when it’s on the basis look you can’t do everything purposively that’s what you've got habit in unconscious workings for or otherwise you'd be so damn busy that you couldn't get anything done and yet I think there's some edge to that and can be related to his later concerns about power. 

01:04:20
JAY HALEY He would have preferred to talk to his patients a lot and have them spontaneously change rather than him deliberately change them. I think that’s true. 

01:04:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:04:30
JAY HALEY And that’s he came from that background of therapy. He didn’t object to studying people who were deliberately changing people, but he himself didn’t want to do it. 

01:04:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:04:45
JAY HALEY And that’s why he would do a lecture with Smithy(ph) rather than a task a directive or something like that. 

01:04:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Yes this is the same man who pointed out very rightly every communication is both the report and the command. 

01:05:00
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

01:05:00
JOHN WEAKLAND Which means you can’t get away from influence. 

01:05:05
JAY HALEY That’s right. That was the fundamental idea he first put in that book on communication, that a message of A to B is not just the statement about A, it’s what B has to do with C here. That’s a powerful idea and… and… and it was… it was a hard idea to accept in psychiatry at that time because they listened to every message from the patient as a report about his interior. 

01:05:30
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:05:35
JAY HALEY They didn’t take it as a statement to the therapist about doing something or thinking in some way or framing or something. You know the one who… who brought that idea in was Sullivan(ph) through Jackson to us. 

01:05:45
1959 Don D. Jackson, MD 

01:05:45
JAY HALEY When you are supervised by Sullivan(ph) or by Jackson who was supervised firstly by Sullivan(ph), if the patient does something the question the supervisor has is what did you just do? Because it was so assumed that the patient was responding to a person whereas in that (inaudible ) the patient was not responding anything but an interior image of something and that was a big step and a big difficult change. But one other things about Bateson that is extraordinary really is that he never dealt with trivial subjects. Whatever he dealt with was important. I mean he would take on the most awesome subject like the nature of the sacred or… whatever he chose to go into. The mysteries of the universe really is what he was into. 

01:06:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:06:35
JAY HALEY And he had a way of… of dealing with these and looked down on people who weren’t dealing with important topics. Its extraordinary what… how he just went through the list of important things in life and chose those to investigate and think about it. 

01:06:55
JOHN WEAKLAND Part of the reason that he had his curios career in which he grew up in academia but was always on the edges, after his… I think in a way he was a reproach to the usual academic world than that he was saying by example is not more specifically. You're not learning up to your own traditions… 

01:07:25
JAY HALEY That’s right 

01:07:25
JOHN WEAKLAND …of tackling big things. 

01:07:30
JAY HALEY He came from a 19th century tradition of science that dealt with the important issues of life really. He was an extraordinary thinker. He was a really connected more with the 19th century than this century in many ways… 

01:07:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:50
JAY HALEY …except the cybernetics, but the scientific tradition was his… his tradition. 

01:07:55
JOHN WEAKLAND He seemed to give was much a more weight in many situations to the poets as he did to the science. 

01:08:00
JAY HALEY Particularly to Blake. 

01:08:05
JOHN WEAKLAND I was not always too clear what the point he was making with was making in citing Blake. 

01:08:15
JAY HALEY Well I think among various things that he admired Blake for is he thought Blake was mad and the madness had come out in the form of genius instead of the form of handicap really. I remember him saying that Blake used to hallucinate, he would hallucinate ahead on a piece of paper and outline it. That’s how he did his drawings. 

01:08:40
JOHN WEAKLAND I mean he was really just tracing. 

01:08:40
JAY HALEY That’s right yeah. And Bateson liked that idea that a normal a (inaudible ) person could hallucinate. That hallucination was part of the living what he was thinking or part of art. But he was a classically educated man and he drew upon the poets, he drew upon the painters as well as the philosophers and I think it was an important aspect to me because when I was 30-years-old when I got on that projects of my 30s were spent with Bateson. 

01:09:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:09:15
JAY HALEY And he was really quite an education in… in many ways with the ideas and the people he brought to that project and his thinking like Blake, T. S. Elliot, (inaudible ) and all the painters. And I remember one of the nicest evenings he provided. My wife and I was ah… he took us to an evening of the kabuki players in San Francisco. 

01:09:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm. Well there's another example of both the width of his span and ah… how he put apparently different things together in some of the metalogues(ph) in the beginning of that volume steps in that in reading it over. I became aware that several of those metalogues(ph) were published in a San Francisco dance magazine. 

01:10:10
JAY HALEY Oh really. 

01:10:10
JOHN WEAKLAND And then I remembered that he did know some modern dancers in the city apparently all they had this little magazine and so where he wrote something up just put it in there. 

01:10:20
JAY HALEY Hmm… that’s (inaudible ) 

01:10:25
JOHN WEAKLAND But that’s about as far away from ordinary scientific publication as I can imagine. 

01:10:30
JAY HALEY That’s right. One of the things too that I was thinking about is how many interesting people were around that bay area by that time that we could draw upon their ideas. We had Alan Watts with his whole view of (inaudible ) that was a new idea at that time. (inaudible ) was in the bay area. 

01:10:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… that’s right. 

01:10:50
JAY HALEY Eric Hoffart(ph) (inaudible ) was on the bay, Bateson didn't have much to do with him, but I did because I'm more a working class type. But his focus was on change. (inaudible ) was there in the power. 

01:11:03
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:11:05
JAY HALEY And then we had the center for the advance study in the behavioral sciences with all the brains that came in straight up there. 

01:11:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:11:10
JAY HALEY And had meetings of (inaudible ) there was a lot of extra ordinary men came up there and women. So we and Gregory knew them all. 

01:11:20
JOHN WEAKLAND That brings up the whole interest in etiology(ph) that we had which was another very important… 

01:11:30
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

01:11:30
JOHN WEAKLAND …piece that fed into things. 

01:11:30
JAY HALEY It was an era when people began to study animals in their natural environment. 

01:11:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:11:35
JAY HALEY And we began to study individuals in their natural environment with the family and we had a lot of people with brains… 

01:11:40
JOHN WEAKLAND And… 

01:11:45
JAY HALEY …focusing at this time. 

01:11:45
JOHN WEAKLAND …both of those approaches very similar to anthropology when you get right down to them. 

01:11:50
JAY HALEY Sure. 

01:11:55
JOHN WEAKLAND And very different from conventional psychiatry. 

01:12:00
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

01:12:00
JOHN WEAKLAND There's something else that I didn’t quite understood got clearer in Gregory's later work. Obviously he's always been at one level or another interested in epistemology, but he got more and more into something that appeared to me to be in his own basic terms contradictory and that is the idea that there is a true epistemology and a false epistemology. 

01:12:30
JAY HALEY That’s true. 

01:12:35
JOHN WEAKLAND Rather than here's one way of looking at things that leads in that direction, here's another way that leads in that direction, but he got so concerned about what he saw I think ruining of the earth, but more and more he is into this thinking about… 

01:12:50
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

01:12:50
JOHN WEAKLAND …that relational epistemology is true and the isolating reductionistic epistemology not that it leads to unfortunate events, but it is just false. 

01:13:10
JAY HALEY I know. That’s when he began to develop a cause that’s right. 

01:13:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:13:15
JAY HALEY His cause before was just scientific exploration. 

01:13:20
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:13:20
JAY HALEY And when he began to save the world he did change on that. 

01:13:25
JOHN WEAKLAND It may be that Bateson is the only person that I can call to mind at least who would include both things like the second law of thermodynamics and certain moral principle's as joined among the eternal… the eternal verities. 

01:13:45
JAY HALEY That’s true that’s true yeah. 

01:13:50
JOHN WEAKLAND Ah I'm not sure I follow that but it’s a matter of some interest. 

01:13:55
JAY HALEY Well, part of the eternal verities to him were what was something we struggled with him with. He was really deep into a 19th century view of man in terms of emotions, grief and happiness. 

01:14:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah that’s right. 

01:14:10
JAY HALEY Love and… and when we tried to get it into an interpersonal or a dyadic description he was uncomfortable with it. I mean he could accept it intellectually but his native feeling was that man was an individual and the problem was the quantification(ph) of the world and his perception of the world and his feeling about the world that’s on. So Bateson would often go back to that and then we'd struggle to get out of that into a triangular description of something. It was hard. 

01:14:40
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. I think one of the best examples is love. I think Gregory would probably agree that you might eventually be able to talk scientifically or interactionaly(ph) or somehow about lust, but only the poets could talk meaningfully of love. 

01:15:00
JAY HALEY That’s very possibly true of him yeah. Lust would be a little personal phenomenon. Oh my. I miss that guy really. He was a lot of fun over the years. He was so helpful when you were struggling with an idea. You know even when it wasn’t the way you wanted to think, you know an example to me is… I was struggling with hypnosis. I was trying to think of it as an interpersonal phenomenon and I couldn't get there always and I was writing a paper I came out in the hall to get some coffee and I said, “Gregory, I have a problem.” He said, “Sit down.” 

01:15:45
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:45
JAY HALEY I said, “I've got a problem describing hypnosis and I need to think about the next step going onward.” And he said well, “Let’s see now what is the state of trance,” and right then I knew. I didn’t want to write about the state of trance and I got out of that into an interpersonal thing from that conversation you know… 

01:16:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Yeah. 

01:16:05
JAY HALEY …even though the position he was talking about wasn’t a guidance position, it was a clarification position really and he always came up with something like that. 

01:16:15
JOHN WEAKLAND Well I not only miss him I could certainly say and probably I should have said it absolutely as the first remark that all over and some… as I mentioned sometimes he was confusing, a few times he was provocative, overall I owe him an enormous debt, he was one of the people most influential in my professional life and development and a good deal of the personal as well. 

01:16:50
JAY HALEY Mine too. He set a standard. You know I was thinking of it this way, that if he was sitting here you and I will shift to a higher level of discourse. 

01:17:05
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:17:05
JAY HALEY Because that’s what he did. He forced you to work at your highest level of thinking. 

01:17:10
JOHN WEAKLAND Hmm… hmm… 

01:17:10
JAY HALEY And… And to have a research director who does that I mean what more can you ask really. 

01:17:15
JOHN WEAKLAND I don’t think much more than that could be said. 

01:17:20
JAY HALEY Yeah. Think we've covered him? 

01:17:25
JOHN WEAKLAND Oh, I think we made a pretty good shot.
