KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Okay, we're live. We're live and we're alive. I'm, ah, Dr. Kathryn Rossi. I'm really pleased to be here because I think that the crafts of what we do needs to involved research and we have three extraordinary researchers right here. I'm gonna take a moment to introduce so that you can distinguished them. We're gonna start right in the middle with Dr. David Barlow and his focus is really on nature and as the origins now instead of anxiety and depression, he's looking at the origins of neuroticism itself as what is underlying the emotional issues that people have and I think that's really beautiful and then we have right here Dr. Steven Hayes and he is absolutely fascinated of how psychotherapy taps into the evolutionary process. A man after my own heart and in that there's multiple levels symbolic, behavioral, cultural, social, epigenetic, you could be a Rossi and, ah, and genetic for both individuals and groups. And so, looking at the evolution and then, we have Scott Miller at the end here and he's a practical man, and he wants to know about what constitutes excellence in psychotherapy so I invite you to tuck in enjoy and I hope you have a numinous experience.

Research in Psychotherapy: Finding Generally Applicable Processes of Change Steen Hayes University of Nevada Where the Field Has Been Welcome to Empirically Supported Treatment! Please Enter and never leave 

00:01:45
DR. STEVEN HAYES For the PowerPoint's up, very good. Thank you. We're going to different order, ah, my mentoring goal actually. Uhm, I think the field, ah, there's, ah, five or 10 are indeed some of the field went through a face where in-- in order the evidence-based it focused maybe too much I think funded by federal dollars or pushed it towards, ah, packages and protocols went to a syndromes. Syndromes themselves are beginning to fall apart, my god, ah, and the packages and protocols I think were okay as a beginning places but I think we need to do something, ah, more focused on what are the processes and procedures inside those packages and protocols. 

00:02:30
Where the Field is Headed: Evidence Based Processes and Procedures 

00:02:35
DR. STEVEN HAYES And when we have evidence-based processes and evidence-based procedures then we're able to fit what we're doing to the individual client and the-- as an old idea psychotherapy started there, ah, but, ah, we went through a, a face where that wasn't are the primary focus and I, I just don't think if you're-- you know, if we can live inside this brick building so this, ah, protocols and the alphabet suit were all a different, ah, developers. By the way, the developers standing up on the top of that-- the building depending what certification of their wonderful technique on analogy. Nobody wants to live-- I don't think many clinicians wanna live inside that straight type. 

00:03:15
Which We Can Use to Help Build What Clients Truly Want 

00:03:20
DR. STEVEN HAYES Ah, if we can dig down to the processes and procedures now then I think we can the evidence-based in the different way and build what clients, ah, truly want. In my analysis and so forth that people are looking at now-- are looking at this kind of cloggy CBP versus-- this is not the way we were grow look at it and I think something can happen when you dig in the processes. 

00:03:40
Processes of Change That are • Changeable • Visible • Linked to solid basic and applied science • Broadly applicable • Integrated into manageable sets 

00:03:40
DR. STEVEN HAYES We want processes that are changeable. We find in all that personality very well and so forth but frankly you can't change it or not has interest there. We want ones that are visible that yo can actually see directly, ah, in the room that you can track up. You wanna based on evidence and I would say even basic science evidence, ah, and that we, we wanna broadly applicable. We can afford to learn a new model for every single little set of a problems. And then, they had to be integrated into a manageable sets. The early work on transdiagnostic processes such as, ah, Alison Jarvis work, you know, in 60, 70, 80 different processes, that's impossible. You got to deal in under five or six or seven, the ones that are-- that 10% that does the 90% on every level, ah, variant.

00:04:30
DR. STEVEN HAYES In the ACT community we try to do that. This is our model but it's more important as a processes. I'm not gonna si-- sing the song of ACT. I just wanna use that as an example and you know within our model we're gonna take processes that we know are repertoire narrowing, avoidance and cognitive entanglement and we'll do things to increase flexibility, cognitive and emotional flexibility. We're gonna take processes that take people out of consciousness and out of the context, the inability to be in the now or your attachment that your narrative story about yourself and instead were gonna try to establish a more open sense of consciousness and awareness linked to the flexible attention to the present moment and instead of, of, uhm, uhm, ah, having a prearranged idea that what we needed to do is laminate symptoms or something like that. We're gonna take the time to ask people what is kind of life you want? What are the qualities that you want? And how can we build that routine that by practice and active engagement in, ah, ah, a life or living? All those six processes or three of it simplifying and to being open, aware and active are what we call psychological flexibility. Now within a model we're, ah, falling, yes, we are randomized trials of packages. We have about 75 but we also recently publish the meta-analysis about 65 component analysis in which we show that each of these procedures produce if you just look at the all role effect sides reasonable impacts with people who have difficulties. So we know that the acceptance is important, values are important, defusion are importance just as procedures. 

00:06:15
Are Changes in These Processes Why Such Procedures Works 

00:06:15
DR. STEVEN HAYES Perhaps more importantly we know that these processes when there measured are functionally important to outcome. We have about 40 mediational analysis in the ACT literature that basically all work and there's almost not a sour note which is a very unusual in psychotherapy. I think we have more and consistency than any other approach in psychotherapy that I know of and it's because from the beginning we'd care about process not about packages and protocols period, end of story. 

00:06:40

00:06:40
DR. STEVEN HAYES So for example, I have an summarized the newest set but this was the first 20 or so of randomized trials where you have look at, ah, a mid or post changes in psychological flexibility processes. Experiential avoidance, moving values, diffusion or overall flexibility and then, follow-up outcomes and the proportion of the variants that's accounted for by those early changes and processes and if you added all up it's about half of the variants that's accounted for. So we know that it makes a difference. 

00:07:15
Exposure + CBT or ACT in Mixed Anxiety Disorders (Arch, Eifert, Davies, Vilardaga, Rose, & Craske, 2011) Clinical Severity Ratings (blind ADIS-IV interviews) Psychological Flexibility 

00:07:15
DR. STEVEN HAYES You know, when you then put it into randomized trials, I like this one because, ah, their legions effect is violated. This was done at Michelle Craske's lab with her studetns, her therapist, her technology of exposure plus CBT, the best out there, ah, some of it, ah, developed, ah, my, my, ah, various team mentor here and Michelle who carried it forward but then. She, ah, is a very good scientist running to sort of ex-- explore these differences putting in, ah, acceptance, mindfulness and pac-- base processes and exposure in a randomized trial and from Peter Polster(ph) was the same-- from post to follow-up there was a more than a standard deviation difference. In her shop with her technology and her therapist and the most important thing was it was mediated by psychological flexibility processes even in CBT but the processes move more when you're targeted and deliberately using the acceptance, mindfulness based technology, that tells us a what? 

00:08:20

00:08:20
DR. STEVEN HAYES It tells us that, ah, openness, awareness, and values-based engagement matters and it matters even when you're putting it in the different theoretical models, different labs and so I can come to you and, and point to for example, this alphabet soup of motivational interviewing and the highlight for behavior therapy and mindfulness based cognitive therapy and ACT and all of them have opening processes in their, ah, technology. Many of them have process evidence, some of them have component evidence that it matters. The same thing with awareness. Most of them now-- all of them or I just picked a reasonable list of the alphabet soup on the lab innovative behavioral couples therapy, et cetera, you can see what's there, uhm, metacognitive therapy, most of them have ways of getting, ah, more connection to consciousness in the present moment and some of them have process in component evidence. And then active engagement linked to values, most of them have procedures, some of them have a components, some of them have processes and the consistency across that when you find that the same kind of processes are important here and here and here and the procedures are being built in. 

00:09:35
A Process Focus is Giving Us Greater Coherence Across • Longitudinal studies • Scoring of client transcripts • Book and computerized studies • Studies of the therapeutic relationship • Theoretical models • Allegiance of investigations 

00:09:35
DR. STEVEN HAYES And when you built out also if you just do it longitudinally you have people for example with, ah, experience sampling methods monitoring whether or not they are open or close and then looking at the natural trajectories without the kind of problems we get into with the legions and so forth and, and therapy studies. Or when you actually score a client transcripts and you can see directly in front of you people being more open and their studies have shown up not so of report by actually just scoring what people say and it predicts what's gonna happen at follow-up. Or when you do the same things with book studies and computer studies where you've taken away or legions and therapeutic relationship and all that, you're gonna freak in website the same process, use the same procedures making a difference. Or when you dig into the therapeutic relationship and we've done that and shown that the reason why the therapeutic relationship mediates outcome is because that models instigate and supports more emotional and cognitive openness, greater awareness and attention to then now and values-based to action. It's the-- it's the means we use to move those processes when we stay with people we model openness, when we attend we model attention to the now and when we care about what they care about we model being able to engage in values-based activity, those things then go across to theoretical models. You know, I've did a session yesterday with motivational interviewing which came out of Rogers work and with our work and if you're there you saw there's a interconnection and that goes across to this problems of a legions and so, I'm not very impressed by the meta-analysis that live inside the court-- the, the early version of, ah, what we are trying to do in evidence-based care but there because I think it was the right model but I think it's changing and I think we're finally getting to a place were gonna be able to give practitioners not the alphabet soup and the adherence, ah, measures link to a certification and tiding to founders that instead will be processes that are important that you can see, that you can move and when you move then good things will happen, ah, that would be kind of a cool day and I don't think we're very far from it. I think we're actually entering into that day so that's why I have to share with you. Thank you.

SCOTT MILLER I'm Scott Miller. I'm the director of the International Center for Clinical Excellence and I want to say thanks for coming to a presentation on Saturday about research. Uhm, I wish this room are full of all 8,000 attendees at the conference because I think research is the life blood of our profession or it should be, ah, and I feel grateful to sit on a panel with two such distinguished researchers that have contributed so much to the field. Uhm, research really is the coin of the realm and if we look back over our history, ah, I think we target that, ah, at a very specific time starting, ah, when hus-- Hans I think back in 1925 published a review of 24 different studies of psychotherapy and in an-- in fact, I think David and I contributed to the 50th anniversary issue of the journal of psychotherapy, uhm, and this last January where we all commented on where the field that comes from since that particular time? Hans I thinks article really made a bold claim essentially he said that the results failed to support the hypothesis that psychotherapy facilitates recovery, and whatever the politics may have been at the time it really did shake the field into awareness that we needed to do something. We could no longer sit around, uhm, and talk about our stories or share our stories of effective psychological work. We really had to provide some evidence and people like David and others have really contributed to a huge body of evidence that was summarized in a position statement that APA, ah, published in August of 2012. 

00:13:45

00:13:50
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, I think this really gives a good summary of where-- where at at the present time much of which, ah, Steven has, ah, hinted out and commented on that basically said that the research evidence conclusively shows that individual group and couple family psychotherapy are effective for a broad range of disorders, symptoms and problems with children, adolescents, adults and old-- ah, ah, and older adults. 2012, this when we're making the statement. Hans I think laid down the gauntlet in 1954. There is overwhelming evidence that what we do works and works really quite well. Uhm, so would you do me a favor and give yourselves a hand. Right. What we do really does work the, ah, outcomes of, ah, clinicians-- average clinicians often, ah, achieve an outcome that on part with tightly controlled randomized clinical trials. 

00:14:45
• Sixty years and 1000's of studies later: • (1) Psychotherapies are roughly equivalent in effectiveness; and (2) patient and therapist characteristics, which are not usually captured by a patient's diagnosis or by the therapist's use of a specific psychotherapy, affect the results." 

00:14:45
SCOTT MILLER In addition, there was one other piece that I think is note worthy in the statement from APA and that statement is psychotherapy there were two pieces here. Ah, 60 years and 1000's of studies later psychotherapies are roughly equivalent in effectiveness. That's number one, this isn't media's thing, this is APA a consensus statement and number two. Patient and therapist characteristics-- now let this sink in-- patient and therapist characteristics which is are not usually captured by a patient's diagnosis or by therapist use of a specific psychotherapy affect to the results. This is where I work and is gone in the last, ah, 10 years, looking at two variables for both the patient and, ah, co-- ah, therapist characteristics that might influence the results. 

00:15:30
How can Therapists Improve? Method Diagnosis T → ← C Therapy BEFORE AFTER 

00:15:30
SCOTT MILLER It's our teams prospective that we have spent a lot of time studying, I think what Steven, you know, use this as perfect analogy, the building, ah, that the box that were in and in many ways eliminating the discussion about what took place between the client and that this is a decision we made in the 1980s when we decided to follow medicine and adapt the randomized clinical trial forget process oriented research and, uhm, ah, instead simply look at package to treatment approaches. Given that the packages that we do have achieved roughly equivalent results the question is, where else could we look, ah, if that's the case? We could Steven says, go back to process research. I say, bravo, it's about time. We were arguing for this in the 1980s. Let's go there and let's go there, ah, with the alacrity. Ah, the second thing I think we need to look at is what happens before and after treatment and what I mean by this is that in the study of top performing clinicians, clinicians who's outcomes stand, ah, head and shoulders above other clinicians. We find that it's not so much what they do in the room, their experience, their particular model, their age, demographics, et cetera, how much time they spent conducting therapy but rather how they spend their time outside of the therapy room what we've called practice outside of practice. 

00:16:55
The Evolution of Expertise The Evolution of Expertise: Research AS WELL AS... PIANO CHESS SURGERY RADIOGRAPHY TEACHING PROGRAMMING SOCCER TENNIS SINGING... 

00:16:55
SCOTT MILLER Our work has been heavily influenced by a Swedish researcher name as Anders Ericsson who's looked at to the acquisition of expertise and why some performers within a domain achieve better results than others. Now, let that sink in. If we're already doing relatively well, if our outcomes are on far with much of medicine then the issue really is studying why some achieve better results than others. Ericsson's work once again says that before and after. We've been looking inside the box I agree process research is the way to go in some respects but I also think we need to look at what those top performers do before and after and when you look at, ah, the work of Ericsson for example in the study of piano players, chess player or surgeons et cetera essentially what he found was there was a common pathway to the development of expertise. Those folks who became the best at what they did simply spend more time working at it outside of their job, something he called deliberate practice. The graph seeing here divides, ah, violin players into thirds and if you look at the top third of violin players world class, ah, symphony level violinist, those folks spend about seven to 15 times more hours outside of their practice, practicing alone to deliberately improve what they do more than the bottom two-thirds. A colleague of mine and I, ah, just finish a study, his name is Gerald Chiao(ph) he's a Singapore based psychologist and has applied, ah, methodology to psychotherapist. It's the first study really of its kind they will had clinicians track what they did during the first eight years of their career. How they spent their time? At the same time we measured their outcomes. We actually knew how effective the therapist were rather than the model that they practice wise. Are you following me here? So looking at those effective psychotherapist-- if you look a t the top third, you're going to see that those therapist with the best outcomes by the eight year of their career had spend 14.5 times more hours outside of practice e-- engage in things designed to improved their performance, that's it. What kind of things? As simple as reading and rereading basic text, studying core processes that Steven is talking about. What else did they do? They focused on their process errors. The thing-- the times when they didn't do their best performance and they were practicing at the edge of their whelm of reliable performance at the zone of proximal development. 

00:19:40
Deliberate Practice Zone of "Proximal Development": •Reliable performance inconsistent •Identification of errors, misperceptions •Setting small process and outcome objectives •Involves planning, rehearsal, reflection Edge of Ability Too Easy Realm of "Reliable" Performance: •Processes executed quickly, automatically •Involves recognition, retrieval, execution Too Difficult Ambit of Admiration: •Abilities of others appear flawless, magical, dramatic •Effort and attention focused on easily recognized, but non-causal factors and/or processes (superstition) •Risk of failure and injury high 

00:19:40
SCOTT MILLER If you want to improve as, as a psychotherapist you can learn one of this box models that Steven has so happily said will, ah, it really have and help does or you can find out where what you do doesn't work or engage your client, focus on those microprocesses and practice outside of practice to improve your efforts. 

00:20:00

00:20:00
SCOTT MILLER We know that the best therapist actually achieve outcomes that are 50% better than average. They expect-- they experienced about 59% fewer drop outs and about 33% less deterioration and in this era of accountability they also provide much more value per dollar spent, ah, in the healthcare system. A combination I think is a good idea. Let's figure out how each of us can improve on a very small specific core processes that Steven is talking about in his research. Thank you.

00:20:50
DAVID BARLOW Good morning everyone. It is my pleasure, ah, echoing my colleagues to be here on this panel and talk about this interesting, ah, topics. I was saying Scott the other day, this is the third consecutive, ah, ah, conference every four years that we've done this so we must be doing something very entertaining. There have, ah, ah, the organizers, uhm, have us do it to let it have Steve, ah, join us, ah, today. I think one of the-- and there's a couple of points I wanna make, I don't have a slide and that's why I wanted go last. Uhm, there's a couple of points I would like to make, uhm, about the comments both of my colleagues have made but before I do I would like to, uhm, make some general comments relating to Scott on the progress in, ah, research in psychotherapy and you're going to see some sharp distinctions and you're gonna see some merits of agreement which is how it usually goes in this sorts of things. Uhm, first of all, I think that, uhm, you know, Eysenck's statement back in 1952 and for most of us who were, you know, just entering the field, well not 1952 but not too long after that, uhm, you know, it was sort of enormous impact. It was widely reviled, you know, as, uhm, you would almost expect it to be if it were what he were challenging was not the science of the outcomes of psychotherapy but rather someone's religious belief and you got that kind of reaction from almost everybody, how would you dare, you know, challenge what we do? Of course, everything works, ah, of course, what we do works and that's not hard to understand the motivation is behind if someone it's been say like doing certain thing, ah, the cognitive science have told us about the, uhm, confirmatory biases we all have that, ah, convince us that the way we do things is the right way to do it. The whole point of research obviously is to try to go beyond our biases and truly discover what the truth is, what's real about situations and how we can move forward. So in this sense, by, ah, although it is different from the position I'm taking now, I think that the randomized control trials are the gold standard of achieving knowledge in the outcomes of psychotherapy to the stay for a reason and that reason is they have actually considerably events or knowledge on specific techniques that are effective for people with specific kinds of problems and that often gets last in here. The notion of psychopathology, all of us who go to graduate school study, ah, medical school, graduate school whatever our training, we study two main things. We study therapy change procedures, schools of therapy whatever you like and we study psychopathology. What are the kinds of problems people bring to the office? Those things have to go hand and hands, it seems to me. I mean, you have to have a good knowledge of what it is your patients are actually suffering from, the difficulties their experiencing, whether it be insomnia or schizophrenia or simple phobia specific phobia in order to best help them and indeed what's happened over the past 30 years, it was very different from the days of Eysenck, is that we have develop procedures that over the decades had been honed down to, ah, ah, have an impact on certain kinds of psychopathology, that's the part that often gets left out. I'll just take one quick example and that is panic disorder. When I was in school we didn't even know panic disorder existed. We didn't know what panic attacks were. Ah, nobody really did they'll, they'll some, ah, no-- nobody really knew what panic attacks were. Ah, we discovered, ah, back in the '70s some of the first that kind of evidence-based procedures were kind of exposure based but in, in general sense and looking back it's almost shamefully naive or you know, how little we knew back then and, ah, the ways in which we administered this exposure procedures, you wouldn't think of doing it today knowing what we know and, ah, knowing what we know about, ah, this processes. And so, when you look at the outcomes it's not surprising the outcomes back then were not very good when we started taking outcomes. Over the years, we discovered that panic attacks are often phenomenon that they drive certain kinds of behavior such as agoraphobic avoidance in many cases and other kinds of, ah, of constellations with their associated with certain kinds of emotional in cognitive processes. We develop some specific treatments to deal with, ah, panic disorder. We have since learned how exposure works. We're doing that very differently, all through decades, the outcomes from these, uhm, efforts four people suffering from this kind of problem increased, increased in a linear passion. Until now, we're at the point where approximately somebody comes in with panic disorder. First of all, they will say as the patient didn't even know what they had and the therapist didn't know what they had and there was a big mystery. They all thought they will go in crazy needed to be chartered away to the mental institution. Either that they were going to die any minute from their panic attacks. Now we all know that's very different, you know what the psychopathology is the, ah, results have consistently improved over the years and you can say the same thing for the variety of disorders and for example, you said the same thing for specific phobia but go to the other one into the spectrum, ah, look at schizophrenia. Now, I don't think and this is where this my good colleague Scott and I would disagree on this part. I'll say we, we agree in a minute but will disagree on this part. Uhm, I don't think any clinician out there would say that procedures don't matter. I don't think any clinician, anyone of you sitting in those chairs will take someone coming in to your office-- well, let's say insomnia or specific phobia and say or the next day someone with schizophrenia and say, "Well, doesn't matter what I do with them. It doesn't matter what procedures I use, uhm, I'll just do what I think is, is, ah, best and, and hopefully have a good relationship that I carry today." You want to obviously do the best job there is for the patient coming in the client, coming in you office were the certain kind of problem if somebody comes in with the-- or in a situation now where you happen to be treating clients with schizophrenia, you would want to use the cognitive remediation procedures, that's different at the cognitive therapy that comes right out of cognitive science that deals with the kind cognitive deficits that are present in schizo-- uhm, in schizophrenia in terms of memory and the, ah, perception and, and the things like that. You would obviously wanna use some interpersonal skills, social skills training to deal with the social deficits, you'd wanna deal with the positive symptoms and yes, we do have psychological procedures now that are a first line treatment of choice in the U.K. to deal with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia at very specific procedures also that some things being hallucinations and illusions. You would wanna put together you know, your best evidence-based psychotherapeutic procedures and that would be different from what you do with somebody with insomnia or specific phobia or something like that. I assume you know, that, ah, everyone would, ah, you know have that kind of-- kind of that attitude. So we have any pro-- so we have made progress because your trials have demonstrated what's effective. Now having said that you know, I absolutely do agree with, ah, my colleague Steve that we now learned enough from that, from these decades of these trials. We now learned enough that we can move beyond this and perhaps begin to identify some principles that are more widely applicable across certain areas of psychopathology such as the emotional disorders or the cognitive disorders or, ah, you know, variety of developmental disorders and by the way, the APA statement that, uhm, Scott refers to, ah, quite frankly, our own practice directory, the American Psychological Association didn't agree with that. That was a guild statement. What you will and it was-- you know, very useful politically to say overall and for everything we do works but the fact is when the APA is currently, ah, writing chronicle practice guidelines they have a last professional group to do this. The first one will come out, ah, probably next year on depression. You will find a very different kind of outcome. They will recommend some specific processes, some specific kinds of approaches that have the evidence-based to, ah, you know, support that use, ah, just as they've done in the U.K., uhm, with the national, ah, ah, kind of na-- that they roll out in the national health service, just as it done on the veterans administration where the role out of the kind of, ah, you know, evidence-based practices including Steve at ACT procedures. So, I think you know, this all served a purpose but we are moving, ah, beyond that know to a set of, ah, of, ah, principles. Uhm, what's I think before making just a last comment on, ah, Steve's work, what's very important I think about Scott's work and I think his lasting contribution will be the introduction of regular, uhm, periodic sets of outcomes measures into the equation and his identification of some of the things that seemed to produce better outcome using this type of process research. I think what we'll see in the coming decade is that all clinicians will, uhm, actually want to adapt some of these procedures where we continually kind of looking at outcomes, ah, boost dropping doubling back seeing why is in this particular patient sitting in front of me doing as well as I could and attempting to find out why, learning what we do from, ah, you know, ah, the research that's got in his college are, are producing. So that kind of process is going to I think compliment, uhm, our continuing developmental effective principles sort of applicable to a certain kinds of psychopathology. The therapist effect thing is very interesting, uhm, Steve pointed out that we don't, uhm, he doesn't get therapist effects in the trials where the people are trained to some kind of criteria, right? Is that right? 

00:32:45
DR. STEVEN HAYES At some exceptions that we do get some therapist effects but, but, uhm, you know, don't need of an, uhm,-- 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, ah, we can do that discussion. 

00:32:55
DAVID BARLOW Okay, we'll do that a minute. Uhm, we don't get in the trials where multi-trials across a lot of science where a therapist to train to a very high standard and the conduct of one therapy or another. We don't get therapist effects and then common sense, well, you know, trained to a very, very high standard and, ah, it doesn't happen with analyzing there's been study after study but does not show therapist effects and my colleague will have a time seeing him shaking his head. He'll have a chance to reply to that, ah, ah, in a minute. It's only when you have the relatively unstructured kinds of therapist that you're going to get affects of some of the, ah, you know, of therapist effects you're going-- you always have patient effects. Well, I'll also say about alliance just to throw some more fuel on, ah, the Scott's fire. Let me say a few things about, ah, alliance. Ah, alliance does predict outcome but you know, there are two kinds of alliance, there's the patient alliance and the therapist alliance. It's the patient alliance that predicts outcome both early and late in the process in our studies. The therapist alliance does very little in terms of predicting, except for predicting a bit of attrition obviously if a therapist just, you know, just doesn't like patient, ah, chances are that's gonna come true but, uhm, given the usual kind of a range of therapist alliance. It doesn't break the patient alliance for example so that's important. Uhm, so there's no question as our research goes forward we need, uhm, attention to these kinds of patient and therapist factors as well as to our procedures that seems as common sense to me and I think the research, ah, support it. Going forward to say one last thing before we start our, our debating Steve talked about the importance of principles, of distilling principles something I agree with. One of the difficulties though is that we have a lot of people coming in for the wrong sets of principles you know, you see them here and it go around you four or five of them here. Now, you have their own sets of, ah, principles. They have a lot of similarities, kind of interesting quickly if you're dealing-- let's say emotional disorders. Ah, it seems to me, we don't wanna make the same mistake that we made in the past of having a plethora of individual, ah, manuals for very thin slices of psychopathology. I agree with my colleagues on that, that we should have these principles but to do that I think we have to try and avoid creating 50 new sets of principles that are relatively similar. So to be provocative let me ask my ask my colleague Steve, are you ready to give up ACT in favor of a unified set of principles that would be common to all of which originators? 

00:36:00
DR. STEVEN HAYES Yeah, may not what I tried to do... 

00:36:00
DAVID BARLOW And some-- and so right away, you only let me finish. Actually, let me stop to you though and, ah, thanks. 

00:36:10
DR. STEVEN HAYES Okay, thank you. Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, actually, ah, I would and that you know, uhm, with the, the point to that slide at the slide when we-- about to cross many different of approaches is that while they talk about in different ways, uhm, this open-- opening processes awareness and contact sensitivity processes, values and, ah, building skills processes are in all of them and, ah, and I-- you do mention the evolution on the way in, I think the reason that is, is that we are just dealing another level of evolutionary process. I think psychotherapist are prompt-- apply the evolutionist whether they know it or not and the essence of that is variation in context with the-- are retained-- re-- ah, with select with it, selective retention and that's how evolution works so that if you want, ah, behavioral system revolve, you have to have variation so go where there is rigidity, try to get some flexibility, cognitive rigidity, emotional po-- behavioral rigidity, try to get alphabet soup flexibility where there's context in sensitivity try to get it sensitive to context because selection criteria that matters in getting practice that it's been retained. And, ah, at the level it unifies us and so, I think unified models are where we gonna go, you know, the, the ACT crew has a society called being a Association for Contextual Behavior Science, it's not dissociation for ACT, ah, and I would expect that within 20--25 years it's not gonna be any ACT anymore. Why would you-- why would their need to be? And but-- but I would expect that the things that are inside the ACT were-- will exist in other ways and I do think there's a advantage right now for protocols at well, a bit beat up on protocols pretty hard as a place to get us to where we wanna go. As you begin to see in these processes and procedures that are linked to the specific kinds of things you see, the strengths and weakness as of the individual including their particular problem which, ah, call psychopathology, as you do that, you can come back and create assemblages that we can then test and randomized trials and you want to do that. I think you can't just go back you know, flight into the process isn't gonna help us. The processes are inside this randomized trials and then that will bring-- tend to bring folks together and are we gonna call that motivational interfering or CBT or ACT or whatever, I don't care what you call it. You know, a lot of that whether we call it stuff is just about turf and, uhm, grasping towards in mortality and it's all gonna disappear in reality. So yeah, I, I agree with that. What for do today? Let's get there fast. 

00:39:00
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, like what-- let me just say that what your-- what I think you see happening here as a, as a practicing clinician, ah, ah, and the numbers we have here in today's meeting although it's not small, ah, it's smaller than I would certainly hope for in a conversation about, about psychotherapy research such an important topic cuz it really is guiding where our profession, ah, ultimately ends up. At the same time, I think sometimes the differences of opinion, ah, between researchers is what drives clinicians crazy, ah, because where they're in front of a client, they don't have the luxury of saying, well, what does the clinical trial say and wait a minute, you're talk to two different researchers and they tell, ah, seemingly, ah, the opposite thing. And so, what I think many clinicians decide as not gonna read research. Ah, in addition, I think researchers when you tried to understand what articles are saying speak in such an arcane language that no regular person can understand it. It sort of like reading Wittgenstein, ah, the, the person who understand it can't relate to anybody else, ah, in, in, in a real way except for other people who've drunk the Kool-Aid, ah, in, in some way, ah, and the very real differences you see is what science is about and so, I beg you to stay with it. Now, David mentions discan-- does, ah, comment that, ah, that APA put out in the fact that they are developing clinical guidelines and then mention nice. The National Institute of clinical excellence in, uhm, in the U.K. and it would be really nice if everybody agreed with nice but nice is supported by people who, who see things in a certain way. It would be nice to think that these things are settled by science but science always has to be interpreted by people. Those people are trained in a particular paradigm in way of viewing the research literature. Let's not be naive about this that what were discovering is the truth settled once and for all that doesn't have to be interpreted by the reader. Even you have to interpret it the-- what the data say, that's what by the way evidence-based practice is. The integration of the best available research in the context of patient characteristics cultures and preferences. It is not-- it is not decidedly using this approach for that problem. Evidence-based practice is a verb not a noun and these debates go on and on. Now, of course, I hope my side and believe my side of the debate which is this notion that certain package treatment for certain diagnosis work better-- I just don't buy it. I don't believe it, I don't think the research supports that view but it's in the back and a forth in exchange. It's in that crucible that something useful actually emergence sticking with it I think is the tough part especially if you're asking yourself, what do I say to that person sitting in opposite me crying their eyes out or full of panic? Then, then it becomes harder to be so sanguine about the reason to process. 

00:41:55
DR. STEVEN HAYES Can I, can I ask you a question Scott... 

00:41:55
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:55
DR. STEVEN HAYES Of how, how you would deal with this, let's take a biblical therapy studies, uhm, there's good biblical therapy studies we know that simply reading well crafted work-- workbooks and so forth produce not as much as you get in therapy but a big chunk or the computerized work, right. We're now seeing reliable differences between books. We see reli-- there studies with reliable differences between books for a particular chapters have been removed. Explain that. How is that possible? 

00:42:25
SCOTT MILLER I, I don't know the studies you're referring to. 

00:42:30
DR. STEVEN HAYES Well, you should know them. Their important and there, there's quite of back of work there. 

00:42:30
SCOTT MILLER You don't know the meter? David doesn't know the meter and he is your teacher. 

00:42:35
DR. STEVEN HAYES Well. 

00:42:40
DAVID BARLOW That's right. 

00:42:40
DR. STEVEN HAYES The one with your mood? 

00:42:40
DAVID BARLOW Yeah. 

00:42:40
DR. STEVEN HAYES Oh, well, there this study done with, ah, with mind over mood where they pulled out the chapter in cognitive, ah, ah, disputation. 

00:42:50
DAVID BARLOW Yeah. 

00:42:50
DR. STEVEN HAYES And got better outcomes which I kinda like because I'm a part of this CBT protocols that I don't think the meta-analysis shows this particularly helpful, cognitive flexibility, cognitive reappraisal meaning that fine, cognitive disputation no, address people in their fight, the last place you wanna go and it was particularly for folks who, uhm, tended to get cognitively entangled, uhm, it's, it's that Hagel et. al. Is it anybody help--helpful, Hagel? 

00:43:20
SCOTT MILLER Starts with an H. 

00:43:20
DR. STEVEN HAYES Uhm, but-- and, ample and then we, ah, have done studies for example mind over mood versus get out of your mind into your life showing, ah, affect size differences between this two very well-developed, well-established and effective, multiple trial show their effective studies. So there's it's, you know, the-- it seems to me it's just what they have saying of, of course, you wouldn't do the same thing for everybody. It also has a sense of it's just that is you know, im-- impossibly bland to think that what we do doesn't matter at the leave of procedure. It does mater. Do we know how to talk about the procedures and identify them so that we can focus on that and is there a lot more in it in that? Is there more in it and no were not very good of talking about it that's why the process work is so important and if-- that perhaps you see as I'm talking about of processes link to procedures. My first thing there is there has to be changeable. It doesn't help to have a process that are out of change and that's gonna require procedures. Now the procedures will include things like empathy. They were include in but you have learn how to be empathic. Their sessions here that will look you throughout to do that, uhm, so I, I think-- I just think there's, ah, what the practice thing that measures-- mention it. Practice is a great thing but if you dig any even further you'll find that it's practice will feedback that has the biggest impact and a lot of the natural feedback that happens in sessions only happens if you're focus on the right thing. If you pick a kid in, you'll say, go outside and shoot a basketball, do at least 1000 shots a day and they can see the ball entering the net without any coaching about how they make shoot the shock. There will be pretty good by getting the ball in the net. They might be shooting in a way the coach is cringe out and not the best way but they don't-- the practice will make a difference. Blindfold that kids, send them out and have a practice just as long and you go out and-- then after all of that practice and you're not gonna see improvement and the problem is, is that we, as clinicians are often blindfold that-- because or even worse we have misdirects. We have our clients telling us, "Oh, that's great. That's really impo-- that's wonderful." We have randomized trial several now in the ACT literature with significantly worst outcomes improvement and not as much at post using our methods that we know in mediational analysis make a difference. And then, that follow up significantly better outcomes. There's a one and JCCP recently that call a slow and steady wi-- wins the race. Twelve-step program, severe substance abuse in folks and in patient. Twenty-eight day program, six hours of training in ACT focused on shame, okay. How to handle shame from that perspective is an odd thing? You're not trying to get the shame to go down initially you're trying to with shame and then catch the piece in there which is helpful to people which is guilt, guilt and substance abuse turns out as a very positive thing and subtract out relate differently to the toxic part which is I'm bad, okay. And we could use methods to do that but it take some, it take some work. At the end of 28 days, there quality of life are gone up but not as much. Their, ah, substance abuse was no different and, ah, there shame had gone down the last. Then, if you'd been in a traditional Pro Start program. At follow-up big substance abuse outcomes, differences, quality of life, big different, social support, big difference and shame big difference. Why? Because the shame went down oppressively. It was Stewart Smalley. And Stewart Smalley is not gonna clean up the kind of there-- trash life you're in when you get put in 20 days in that patient program in Nevada. Well, they don't wanna spend money on anybody. You know, and in fact, we look at shame and it was the mediator of outcomes. The more shame people felt, the better they did, not because shame is good but because having to come now slowly in a way that's healthy then predict that it would keep going down. Now, here's what this tells me. Think about of being a clinician in that in patient program. You got patients looking right at you and saying, "Thank you so much for what you've done. I feel so much better about my life. I know I can move forward from here." The correlation between that in substance abuse three months later was minus 0.5 it's counting for 25% of variance. With that minus amount the more they were saying that, the more they're hammering down drags you on alcohol three months later because it wasn't clean. It wasn't, it wasn't real. It was suppressive conversely if we can walk people through this process we got those consistent outcomes. Now what I say to that, that is that we put clinicians in the point where they have to shoot basketballs without being you know, see if the another ball goes to the net and the scientist have to give clinicians the things they to see it and it turns out this processes of open aware and active engagement or good nets to look out. They predict outcome, you could see them in the session and your movement you can trust them and you can trust them a lot more than symptom reduction whatever that means inside that syndrome or models. It's not all of it, you can then go back and do packages. I know I've talked too long but just 20 seconds. If I training my students I first say, "Follow up protocol. Here's a protocol, do it." The next session I say, "Follow the protocol but for god sakes, ah, ah, practice it and then leave it back in the room, you know, don't give yourself any notes, no help," and them the third case I say, "Don't follow the program." I say, follow the process. So protocols are helpful in our RCT, we can work to that with this process thing but the, the practical thing we need to give clinicians is how to see the ball go to the net. 

00:49:15
DAVID BARLOW Just, ah, uhm, couple of comments and I'm not the oen who thought him to talk that long right away, to pick that up on his own but, ah... 

00:49:25
DR. STEVEN HAYES I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

00:49:30
DAVID BARLOW And I say, uhm, I think that's quite frankly illustrate some value of discuss worth when his providing some of these mechanisms for feedback to clinicians that, ah, will allow you to see whether your going through the net now we have to of course, get together and decide what are the important, ah, ah, kinds of feedback to give and, and, you know, that, that's task, ah, in front of us. Uhm, but I will say a few things about the, ah, the guideline issue, uhm, which I can't resist. So the NICE is a National Institute for Clinical Excellence. This is national body in the U.K. that writes clinical practice of guidelines. It's-- is unbiased as it can get. They-- believe me if you been a part of this process and by this way the same thing in the BA the same thing in the APA, I mean you're at the same thing in the FDA by the way which in charge with... 

00:50:25
SCOTT MILLER FDA is not bias. 

00:50:30
DAVID BARLOW Have you ever... 

00:50:30
SCOTT MILLER And FDA is not bias and on David? 

00:50:30
DAVID BARLOW Have you ever known anybody who's attempted... 

00:50:35
SCOTT MILLER Money influences the FDA to decision the people who sit on the FDA often take kickbacks from the pharmaceutical industry, David come on. 

00:50:40
DAVID BARLOW Cuz it's not true. That's not to say the FDA by any means is perfect. You have to sign your life way. You have to have an FBI investigation to get on that F-- ah, FDA believe me I'm on it. I've, ah, I've, ah, had that experience. 

00:51:00
SCOTT MILLER You have a bias too David. That's the point. 

00:51:00
DAVID BARLOW Well, wouldn't that be a valuable one? 

00:51:05
SCOTT MILLER It would be a valuable one if the bias is represented between various points of view but it's not. 

00:51:10
DAVID BARLOW Anyway, to, to, uhm, continue on, right? The NICE guidelines they have done their best to.... 

00:51:20
SCOTT MILLER That I would agree with. 

00:51:20
DAVID BARLOW Appoint people who are objective to develop this guidelines. The veterans administration in raw spending the $100 million they've spent through all out these treatments they have done their best to accomplish the same goal. The APA, believe me, they have done their best-- they have a steering committee, they have done each of disorder has, ah, they have done their best to appoint us wide a variety of opinions as possible. All they will do, you know, is come out with a recommendation for a first line treatment. Now this is where I think the point often gets missed. What happens then? What happens then? Scott talked about the definition of evidence-based practice and it's quite correct. It's up to the clinician to then integrate the information from the best research practices along with the individual sitting in front of them. It's quite correct on it. So, what is the clinician going to do when they have-- let's say the brain disorder and DSM called the excruciation disorder, okay, sealed, ah, you know, skin picking, uhm, and, ah, it can be very, very severe and very disabling. Ah, what if you have never treated a patient like that before? Would it be helpful for you to look at the guidelines and say, where should I start? Where should I start with this patient? Well, he has the literature, he's, ah, is the, ah, outcome. We recommend you start here. That's all the guideline does and say, where would you as a clinician is where we suggest you start all things being not equal, you know, and then you will start with that. Then, what if it doesn't work? Then, here's where the feedback comes in. Here's where your clinical judgment comes in. Some of the guidelines have second line treatments whatever doesn't work, what does other couple of other things you will try. Uhm, so all these guidelines do is simply they have, you know, you know, ideally is help the clinician decide where to start. Now, when I talk about there's no therapist affects in our clinical trials, the reason is obvious. We spend vast amounts of money to train therapist to a very high level of, uhm, adherence and competence and we monitor to that all the way along but-- that situation is never going to obtain across the wide variety of practice. There's always going to therapist differences and those differences are going to be an expertise in carrying out the procedures, relating to the patient to various sorts of things, another place where I think the feedback you know, can be very valuable. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN E-- excuse-- excuse me. I have a very-- I'm sorry to interrupt. 

00:54:00
DAVID BARLOW Yeah. 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN I have a very direct question that at least for me would really clarify things and I think might clarify things for a lot of us. Uhm, I need to know as a therapist sitting in the room, is it more important for me to diagnose the clients or is it more important for me to diagnose the moments? And so, I, I would like all of three of your perspectives on that, which you would say is more important for me as a therapist and why? 

00:54:30
DR. STEVEN HAYES Well, I think traditional syndromal diagnosis is a object theater. I think what is done or finished NIHM which created this monster. It wasn't the late, the late beta that created. It was you and I who made thrilling the fund that we saw the shift from DSM two or three are old enough to remember and I saw that you know, it happen and people were critical actually be brought in to the panels and so forth and, ah, you know, now they're saying we're not gonna fund them and if you do that DSM stuff as to fated and created. So, ah, that does not mean the individual doesn't matter and there is specific problems and yeah, you can kinda question them psychopathology really matters but it matters at the level of what are the processes that predict moving towards, ah, a better life and we need to bring in things like quality of life, psychosocial functioning and so forth and get out of the five out of nine and four to seven and it's always 50% plus one so there you please can say there's one thing that overlaps. It's bold. The thing was bold from the beginning. It's done. It's finished. I don't wanna touch it. If I'm gonna get money and they've-- let me make do it all dance that dance but as a clinician I wanna know what are, what are you working towards? What's going on in your life? And that is there in the moment but it includes diagnosis but not this other kind of-- its old idea I think of functional analysis and making sure that the clients purposes are in there, you-- and you can say where it likes schizophrenia or something you ask people what they want and they want things like friends, you know, they want things like fun. Why they're working on that? 

00:56:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:10
DR. STEVEN HAYES And that, that-- that's-- they'll be where I would go then and to do that you're gonna be how to read the moment. 

00:56:15
SCOTT MILLER If you're already in the field, one thing that you can do straight away is to begin measuring your outcomes and find out how effective you are and look for those instances where you're not, that's your edge of reliable performance. Secondly, look for when you're clients are engaged or not. All of these models are great if you're client is not engage by them then they're not interested in that. So find out if your client is engage just what I would say and then ones you find those shortcomings in your clinical practice then, I think were right over to the process research as I understand it. I'm not an expert in, in Steven's research, ah, where we need to go and find tune in our abilities, ah, to, to keep that person engage. Uhm, whether or not psychiatric diagnosis or the DSM diagnosis predict stuff you're gonna get three very different opinions that I, I really don't think matter a whole out. Uhm, what I think matters is, is your client engage with you? Are they moving forward? If they're moving forward, keep going. If they're not, you better learn something else. 

00:57:15
DR. STEVEN HAYES Could I, could I-- I know we're at, we're at the end but can I ask my mentor one hard question? The problem I see coming down and I have fought for practice guidelines as you know been involve in and, and that is, ah, as you have. The problem I see is if we're immediately gonna be talking about disorders or right back into the system that I have made itself as running away from his past as he can go. Ah, a better-- what do you think they were gonna still have anxiety disorder and like you know, thought disorder et cetera and that's gonna be way it's kinda be organized or 20 years from now there's gonna be something like experiential avoidance disorders. I mean, seriously, I mean and so, if you give guidelines of procedures for disorders it sound to me like, ah, I wanna know procedures for people with processes that narrow or expand their lives focused on chunks that really make a difference and I'm not, I'm not clear that it, that it is when most technology seem to apply cross all this so called disorder. It just, ah... 

00:58:20
DAVID BARLOW Yeah, just, just briefly, so I, I think were probably out of time. Ah, you know, we, we operate where we're at. We operate, you know, currently in terms of policy with what we have in front of us. You'll be great if the policy makers could say, "Steve is right and Scott is right and we should tamp diagnosis, tamp, ah, all this," but most people-- the fact is still operate on that. You have to convince insurance companies, you have to convince the, ah, state mental health, ah, groups, you have to convince a big deal of organizations, doesn't happen overnight. You know, you can have RAPA saying, "You know what we just gonna do what Steve says," ah, even as, as much as we might agree with and I think they operate where it is. I think it's our job collectively it is a job of research and by the way, ah, the research increasingly is going to include everybody in the room is going to help us provide information on what's working in everything that's gonna part of the affordable care act, you know, all of the, ah, increase in, in, ah, accountability and measures taken in things like, ah, uhm, to get a-- to develop this consensus on which of the variations of these new ideas were talking about from a research point of you which vision is really going to be correct and, and, ah, what's going to be the, the role for the future but you know, it's just, ah, uhm, as much as we wish it too just can't happen like that I think. 

00:59:40
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI Thank you. Thank you all for the spirited discussions. 

00:59:45
DAVID BARLOW Thank you. 

00:59:45
KATHRYN LANE ROSSI We have more to think about and we'll meet again. 

00:59:45
DR. STEVEN HAYES Okay. Sure.
