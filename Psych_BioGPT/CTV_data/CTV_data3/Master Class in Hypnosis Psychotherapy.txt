Master Class in Hypnosis Psychotherapy Jeffrey Zeig, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Welcome this morning. And, uh, this is Dr. Yapko, Michael Yapko, my dear friend who has graciously agreed to join me on the podium for this event. And our event today is a master class. And, master class means that we, and I are charged with showing some mastery and trying our best to be elephant. 

00:00:40
MICHAEL YAPKO It seems so unlikely. 

00:00:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Not elegant. No, reverse that. To be elegant, not elephant. Special pun for Michael, who has at times working with elephants. Maybe that will come up in the course of our event. So what we intend for today is that were going to do demonstrations. And that I'll do the first demonstration, and then Michael is going to comment on that. It's a supervisory format. And, the common format that we traditionally use is that Michael will comment especially in detail on the things that he liked that I did. And then he will contrast his approach. And he'll say what he might have done differently. And then we'll dialogue a little bit. And then we'll ask for questions and answers, questions from you. We'll have a question or an answer period. And we'll be able to dialogue with you. And then we'll take a short break. And then we'll come back. And then Michael will do a demonstration, and he'll work with somebody here. And then I'll make a commentary on the things that I liked that he did and some options that I might have, some turns that I might've taken differently. And then we'll repeat the process in the afternoon. And this is the fourth master class that we've done, post conference master class. And it's been so successful. I did two Eric Polster(ph) and I did one, saw you right there for the first one, yup. And, I did one with Stephen Gilligan. And so, I, you know, invite the people whose work I admire to join me on the podium. And certainly Michael was one of those people whose work I consistently admire and learn from. So, I'm pleased that he's agreed to take part in the event. Okay, so that gives you some idea. This is a moment of learning about clinical work by experiencing it and then doing some talking about it and describing some of the things that we think that we're doing and that we think each other is doing. 

00:02:50
Michael Yapko, Ph.D. 

00:02:50
MICHAEL YAPKO I would like to chime in a bit. I want to say, first of all good morning and thank you for coming. And thanks to Jeff for inviting me to do this. It's my honor. It's my privilege. But, I want to make a couple of comments about this whole process. You know, I think one of the mistakes that people make when they watch clinical demonstrations, is they kind of filter it through their own feelings and their own perspectives about things. And, that's one level of consideration, but I think an even more important consideration is to watch the client's response and to discover what this person is responding to. You know, one of the things that I really enjoy doing, which certainly defines me as one of the most boring people on the planet, is I like watching therapy sessions. I like watching people do therapy. And when I watch somebody do something that is so different than what I would do, the first question I'm asking is did it work? Was it helpful? And then if it was helpful and it clearly worked, but it was very different from what I would've done, I learned something. But, I start by asking myself the question, "Why wouldn't it have occurred to me to say that were do that when clearly it was so helpful to the person?" So, there are a lot of right ways of approaching this, and, and I think that's a really important point to emphasize that we are going to hopefully be able to demonstrate some useful approaches to hypnosis and psychotherapy today. But, the key thing always is recognizing that no matter what we do, you might have done something very different that worked every bit as well or better than what you saw up pear. So, again,my thanks for coming this morning. 

00:04:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So, please keep in mind when you volunteer that this is being webcast at it's being recorded for posterity. So, the problems that we need to work with need to be somewhat circumscribed and not too personal because of the, the fact that we're recording and transmitting them and that we're going to ask the volunteer, demonstration subject, to sign a release form. So, with that and no further ado, we need another place to sit. 

00:05:20
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm, I'm gonna sit right there, down there. 

00:05:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, I think that that's a good idea. 

00:05:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And, I think that we should also say that whoever either of us work with today should not have been volunteers previously at other meetings or other demonstration sessions or people that we know. The whole idea is let's start fresh with somebody new and see where it goes. Okay? All right. 

00:05:40
JEFFREY ZEIG That's great. Okay, then I need your headset. 

00:05:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Oh, yeah. oh yeah. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Turn it off. That's great. Okay, so please, who would like to be the first volunteer working with me? I have a volunteer. We don't even know what the, what the issue is, but, why not? Okay, and you can put this on your right ear. And it will go, no, like this. You can just imagine yourself as Madonna. And, okay, and did we turn this on? Okay, great. And then, you're here. And you can think and you can respond thoughtfully to something that you really want to accomplish. And you volunteered very quickly. So, let's say that this session, you and I together is incredibly successful. Wildly successful. More successful than you may even hope. What will be the outcome. What will be the result? 

00:07:10
CAROLINE So the issue is that I, I cut my foot. I've got a really sore bruised foot. 

00:07:15
JEFFREY ZEIG We are going to have to get a little boost on the microphone. Can you hear? No. So, we need somebody to, to adjust the microphone level for her microphone. And if one of the volunteers could get some assistance in that regard. Do we have a volunteer who is going to assist? If not, okay. Yeah. So, we don't, okay, just a microphone test. Say a few interesting words. 

00:07:50
CAROLINE Testing, testing, testing. Delphiniums. So, testing, testing, testing, testing. Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing. 

00:08:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, were getting there now. Okay. Okay, so tell me your name. 

00:08:15
CAROLINE Caroline. 

00:08:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Caroline. Okay. Caroline, you started to say something about the issue. 

00:08:25
CAROLINE Yeah. So, so what it is is I cut my foot about a week ago or more. 

00:08:30
JEFFREY ZEIG You cut your foot? 

00:08:30
CAROLINE And it's still very bruised and it's a very tender. And it's hard for me to walk on it. 

00:08:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:08:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And I believe that, that we do things for a reason. We get trauma for reason. So, I kind of know what it's all about, uh, and I've been trying to hold it. But, it's also, it's disrupting my life because it's, I like to walk. 

00:09:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, yes, it's disrupting your life. And, you know that there are things that you do and that those things are done for reason. What's the reason that you understand? 

00:09:10
CAROLINE Uh, the reason is that, uh, it's about self caring and looking after myself. 

00:09:20
JEFFREY ZEIG About looking after yourself. About caring for, for you. Okay, so please tell me, this session has been wildly successful. It's been incredibly successful. And then what is it that we'll accomplish? 

00:09:35
CAROLINE Yes, so, so what I'd like to go away with is a feeling of, yeah, I can, I can do that without the constant reminder of the tender sore foot. I can, I can do that and I can walk up, I can go for walks and it can be good. And I can, you know, walk up central New Zealand, things like that. I can go on long walks, and I can be okay, and I can do whatever I need to do, which is the reason that I hurt my foot. 

00:10:10
JEFFREY ZEIG The reason, uh-huh. I don't understand quite yet, but it's something about caring. 

00:10:15
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:10:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And then when you'd know and you really know that you're caring for yourself, then the likelihood of an accident, the likelihood that you might injure your foot. 

00:10:25
CAROLINE Yeah, so, so, uh, what I feel is that this, I have a constant reminder every, every time I walk about this tenderness in my foot. So, it reminds me, sometimes it almost makes me vomit actually, I feel like vomiting it's so exquisitely sore and, uh, and I want to be able to like, like, on a daily moment by moment basis have that lesson without having this is exquisitely sore foot. 

00:11:10
JEFFREY ZEIG But why do you believe that something psychological will help you to, to have the result that you want? What you're waiting for, is you're waiting for your leg, your foot to heal. 

00:11:25
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY ZEIG You're doing good. You, we need another help, more help with this microphone. So, it's nice to have positive feedback, but too much positive feedback, that's a little bit. You're doing good. 

00:11:40
CAROLINE So I don't want you just to take the symptoms away. I, I am a a doctor, and I really believe... 

00:11:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Your and M.D. A physician. 

00:11:50
CAROLINE Yeah. I really believe that symptoms are a communication from the unconscious mind. And, that if you take the symptoms away, and I've had symptoms taken away, and I've got something worse. So, I want to learn from this and this, the tenderness in my foot is, feels like far in excess of what I would expect from a cut. The bruising, I mean I know I, when I was, when I cut my foot I didn't look after myself. I just was the blas� and just thought, I mean it the blood was pouring out. And I said, "Oh, to hell with it. This is not what I want. I want to wash my hair right now." So I just kept on letting the blood pour out. And then when I actually sat down, I thought, "Oh, shit. This is." I went into shock. There was so much blood. So, I didn't look after myself. I sort of feel like my body is punishing me for not looking out, because it's so, it's so tender. So, so I feel like I want to go away from this session with the lesson, but without the pain anymore. Yeah. 

00:13:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Okay. And, the lesson to encapsulate the lesson, how would you encapsulate the lesson? Let's not have you encapsulate the lesson, in words. Let's have you encapsulate the lesson with a gesture. Okay. Hold that for a minute. Feel your hand against your chest as if your hand were speaking to you. And that as you feel the gentleness of your hand against your chest, it could be as if your hand is really speaking to you. As if your hand is communicating to you. And as if the gentle movement of your hand and as if the gentle pressure of your fingers. And the repetitive nod of your head were communicating something to you that you could begin to breathe in. So it would be a moment in which you can wordlessly embody this sense of that message. And then as you do that, perhaps there can be a sound and feeling that accompanies that gesture. What's happening now? 

00:14:50
CAROLINE Uh, the sound is, it's okay. It's okay. You're doing okay. 

00:15:05
JEFFREY ZEIG So slow down and gently in your mind, it's okay. And that as you continue to get the sense and realize the sense and begin to feel and incorporate the sense of it's okay, then that can be something that can morph and change into you're doing okay. And as you can get the sense of yes, you're doing okay, then there could be the realization that morphs and evolves into I'm okay. And that the reality of the nodding of your head and the reality of the gentle and tender tear can further reinforce the realization I'm okay. And as you let that go, grow inside you, see where else that takes you. And what's happening now? 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:00
CAROLINE I know I'm okay. 

00:17:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Okay, well feel it, don't just rush by those words. 

00:17:15
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:15
JEFFREY ZEIG I know. 

00:17:15
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. I know I'm okay, but, but it's, it's what I'm doing. It's got to be okay, and that's, uh, that's the trembling. That's, that's the fear. That's the tenderness. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so come back here, your eyes. Tell me about the trembling. Where's the trembling? 

00:17:45
CAROLINE Uh, the trembling is in my heart. And, the tenderness is in my foot. 

00:18:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And, let's say and you'll have to confirm with me if that's true that the trembling has something to do with not doing okay. And here I'm holding in my hand the world of not doing okay. And not doing okay could the accidentally on purpose wounding yourself or it could be not caring for yourself adequately when you have a wound. Or it could be not respecting the wisdom of your body or it could be your body somehow reminding you that you should take care of yourself. So, here's the force of not okay, and if I represented as a kind of trembling, not doing okay, right? Here it is. I've got it. Not to doing okay. Would that, would that be an adequate representation of the trembling? 

00:19:10
CAROLINE Uh, I can't really relate to it being out of there. It's here. I just kind of can't see it out of there. 

00:19:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, so if we took it out for a minute, from there, and we put it over here, it would give you a chance to see it at a distance. And that this would be the force of not doing okay. 

00:19:35
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:19:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And that's what you would want to have in here is more of that felt sense of caring for yourself. I'm trying to understand. Just take your time and see that I am a somewhere near the target and that you can help me to understand your reality. 

00:20:00
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so, so now what it feels like is within myself being, and that represents the doing, and that's what the trembling is. So, actually. 

00:20:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Okay, so is that, stay with it, take your time. 

00:20:15
CAROLINE So, within my being I'm actually, I'm really okay, and. 

00:20:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Really okay. 

00:20:25
CAROLINE Yeah, I am. I'm really okay. It's the doing that this issue is about. Uh, and the doing is what I've been trembling about. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Okay, so now rephrase that in terms of what would you have yourself do differently so that starting here, this wouldn't happen. 

00:21:00
CAROLINE Je ne comprend pas. 

00:21:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm sorry? 

00:21:05
CAROLINE I don't understand what you said. 

00:21:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, I'm not understanding perfectly either. So, I'm just trying to coordinate with you. And trying to coordinate about what you would have to incorporate inside yourself that would accomplish your goal. 

00:21:20
CAROLINE Coordinate within myself to accomplish the goal. Okay. 

00:21:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Do you see yourself as somebody who is a reckless person? Thoughtless person? 

00:21:40
CAROLINE Do you want to know the contents of what this is about? No? No, no. Uh, well. 

00:21:50
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm trying to sharpen the focus. 

00:21:50
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, lots of people think that I'm being reckless. You know, kind of, I've spent 30 years being a doctor, and I'm giving it up. So, so this is my fear. It's, uh. 

00:22:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Take your time. You're getting closer to yourself. I want to encourage you to feel your way through. It seems like you're really spiraling in on yourself. 

00:22:30
CAROLINE Yeah. Okay. Uh, yeah. 

00:22:45
JEFFREY ZEIG What is the yeah? 

00:22:45
CAROLINE So, it is about separating the doing from the being. Uh, and, uh, and the constant, yeah, okay. I can, I can see it, where I met so far. 

00:23:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:23:10
CAROLINE The tenderness in the foot is about movement. This is about doing. I can see the connection. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Say it a little louder so I can hear. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY ZEIG The foot, the tenderness in the foot is, is the equivalent to the tenderness I feel about the doing. However, I feel very much that I, that my being is here, and my doing is there. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, or that's a good order for it. 

00:23:40
CAROLINE Yeah, I know. Yeah. 

00:23:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Then you, you came to that spontaneously that my being is here and doing. Okay. And, as you really take in that philosophy and the order of that philosophy, then does that, where does that take you? What does that allow you to then do and how does that allow you to then proceed? 

00:24:15
CAROLINE Well, what I've got to is that I am not what I do. It's separate. What I do is not me. I am me, and what I do is what I do. 

00:24:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So, take a moment and go inside, and take that gentle thought of I am me. And that care full thought of I am me, and get to that felt sense of being. And then go back to the moment of the accident in your mind. And revisit that moment of the accident in your mind. And just before that moment, preceding from that I am me and it's okay and I'm doing okay and I am okay. Then how would you have yourself do in replaying that moment? 

00:25:40
CAROLINE Okay. Go back to before the accident. Uh. 

00:25:50
JEFFREY ZEIG You're going into the shower? 

00:25:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yup. Okay. So, you need to help me a little bit with this, if you don't mind. So, I go into the shower, and what was the question? 

00:26:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And then, then you're getting that gentle sense, and you're getting that tender sense I'm okay. And you can feel it in your heart. And then what would you have yourself do differently as you replay that accident? 

00:26:30
CAROLINE I would connect with myself. I was irritated about something. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So do it, do it slowly. I connect with myself. I go into the shower. I connect with myself. And then what happens next? As if you are playing it, replaying it in slow motion. 

00:26:50
CAROLINE Uh, I am, I'm not busy doing. I'm being. 

00:27:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Speak up just a little bit. 

00:27:05
CAROLINE I'm not busy doing. I'm being. I'm being with how I feel. 

00:27:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So you're really present. 

00:27:10
CAROLINE Yeah, with myself. 

00:27:10
JEFFREY ZEIG With yourself. 

00:27:15
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And as you're present with yourself, just review that moment in the shower and review it in your mind, and the present with yourself. And what's happening? What's transpiring? 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:35
CAROLINE Just this feeling of nothing to do, nowhere to go. Just to be. And, uh. 

00:27:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Human merely being. 

00:27:45
CAROLINE Yeah. Being. 

00:27:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, and as you do that, what happens in the shower? 

00:27:55
CAROLINE Nothing. I just stay with myself, and the accident doesn't happen. The cut doesn't happen because I'm with myself. 

00:28:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And now go into your foot, and imagined that you're saying that message to your foot, that as I am. 

00:28:15
CAROLINE As I am being. 

00:28:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Human merely being. Then? 

00:28:25
CAROLINE As I am with you, I don't need to cut you. I, I don't need to hurt you. 

00:28:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And, how does your foot to respond? What's the feeling that you're put response with back to you? As you speak to your foot in those gentle tones? 

00:28:45
CAROLINE It's a relief. It's like, oh yes, at last. she's got it. 

00:28:55
JEFFREY ZEIG That's a big. 

00:28:55
CAROLINE Yeah. Sort of feels like there's a song been waiting waiting, been waiting so long. Yeah. For her to remember to return. We've been waiting, waiting. We've been waiting so long. We've been waiting for her to remember to return. Yeah. 

00:29:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And then just continue to take a moment and feel your way into that. Be with that sense. And the response of your foot. And the gentleness again of the touch of your hands against your chest. And, how's your heart beat right now? 

00:30:05
CAROLINE It's still, calm. 

00:30:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Soft. Gentle. 

00:30:10
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And then, should you want to you can begin to imagine yourself realizing that sense, that present sense, and imagine yourself extending that present sense. 

00:30:45
CAROLINE Uh, I can imagine myself. 

00:30:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Extending the that present sense. As if you were opening your eyes to a different way of being. And them as you think about extending the that the present sense, and just see what aspects of your life your inner mind generates as important to you. 

00:31:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, when I'm in this space, there's nothing to do, nowhere to go. I just, I have no desire to, I don't need to do anything. Yeah, I don't need to worry about what's out there. 

00:31:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, well, I could say it as I've said too many people that it could be a difference in one letter. That the momentum changes from an "O" to an "E". And, that what I mean by that is that the moment changes from a moment of I've got to to a moment of I get to. So it changes from an "O to an "E". This is what I've got to do. This is what I get to do. Yes? 

00:32:25
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:32:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Does that resonate with you? 

00:32:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, yeah, it does. 

00:32:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So then how do you imagine extending that into your, into your work, into your home life? 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And as you imagine yourself extending that into your work and into your home life, let's think of that as a way in which you get to be more tender with yourself. 

00:33:00
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. It feels like it, um, everything arises from a state of bliss as opposed to a state of, um, of doing, of making it happen, so that it's just. 

00:33:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so know how are you going to anchor yourself to coming back there so that you don't start to go here? 

00:33:35
CAROLINE Uh, that has got to do a lot with shoulds. 

00:33:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Got. Got. 

00:33:40
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Gets. Get. Get. 

00:33:50
CAROLINE That's got a lot to do with ego, and this is to do with essence, my essence. Yeah. 

00:33:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Sounds very Sartrean(ph) like existential. That existence precedes the essence of doing, the essence of being. Yeah, so I'm trying to help you to recognize that that trembling could be a little signal. And when you get the sense of should, should, should, got, got, got that there will be a realization that you can return here. And is that, how close am I to what's meaningful to you? 

00:34:40
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. Very close. 

00:34:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Very close. 

00:34:45
CAROLINE This, this comes from a place of joy, and this comes from a place of intellect. Yeah. 

00:34:55
JEFFREY ZEIG So then, the question is that to make this event of you and I being together here really meaningful, how do we make it permanent? 

00:35:05
CAROLINE Yeah, absolutely. 

00:35:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah? So, what's the wisdom of that? 

00:35:15
CAROLINE Uh. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:25
CAROLINE So, there was a battle between this and this. 

00:35:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, that's how you see it, yes. 

00:35:40
CAROLINE It was. 

00:35:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And your foot was the battleground. 

00:35:45
CAROLINE Yeah, my foot got, you know, kind of stabbed in the battle. And, when I'm in this space, this space of bliss, there's no battle. 

00:36:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so let's check again with your foot and make sure that your foot is in agreement with what it is that you are saying as far as your insight is concerned. And that that insight is something that can be there for you. And that the signal system works like an amber light. And the amber light just says to you, "You're coming to an intersection, and this would be a good time to stop." So, let's just check in with your foot and see how your foot responds. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:36:45
CAROLINE So, my foot wants to be part of my body. 

00:36:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:36:55
CAROLINE And, my foot is about movement forward. And this is about being in the world. And, this is about being in my bliss. 

00:37:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And that this is the starting point. 

00:37:15
CAROLINE Yeah. yeah. 

00:37:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so how's your foot feel now? 

00:37:20
CAROLINE How does my foot feel? It wants to be part of my body. 

00:37:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so bring it back. And, feel the message and I think that we don't have to be psychoanalysts to say that your foot is saying to you to be tender with yourself in this sense. So, how would you bring your foot back now and complete the process? 

00:37:55
CAROLINE I, I feel like it's all about going into my heart. When I go to the level of my head I go to the level of fear. And when I go to the level of my foot, I sort of go away from my heart. So it's kind of like my heart is my anchor. So, uh, my foot represents movement. This represents career and achievement and survival. And, and doing and etc. So, it's this whole incredible thing about trust that the only place I could really center in the trust is in my heart. 

00:38:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Now, are you getting where you wanted to go by virtue of coming up here? 

00:39:00
CAROLINE Okay. So what I wanted is I wanted the message from my foot, and I wanted to be able to walk on my foot. And I realized that. 

00:39:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Without excessive. 

00:39:15
CAROLINE Without excessive pain, because I want to be able to go walking, because I like walking. Uh, so, uh, so it's a pretty profound message that my foot is giving me about. 

00:39:40
JEFFREY ZEIG So the question is have you gotten what it is that you wanted to by virtue of coming here? 

00:39:45
CAROLINE Yeah, so I've got a profound message from my foot. And, so my foot can relax and it doesn't need to keep on trying to get my attention. 

00:39:55
JEFFREY ZEIG As long as you're not doing any tissue damage, as long as you, there's no, there's no need for any excess psychological message from your foot. Is that a way of, an adequate way of phrasing it? 

00:40:10
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. So I feel like, I feel like I've heard my foot. And it's a big message I needed to hear from my foot. And so, I can thank my foot. And go walking again. 

00:40:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so now, so, so we've adequately accomplished what it is that you wanted to accomplish. 

00:40:30
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great. Let's just have you use your head just a little bit in a different way, and have you come over here, okay? 

00:40:40
CAROLINE Physically? Okay. 

00:40:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Sure. Over here. And then, just take a perspective of, you know, you and I will take a perspective on what happened between the two of us, what transpired in these minutes between the two of us. And then just get some, you know, cognitive structure and think about it and see. Has, has this been a good interaction for Caroline? 

00:41:00
CAROLINE Yes. It's been profound. I mean it is a crossroads. It's, uh, it's a huge step in my life. 

00:41:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Good. A good step. A tender step forward. That's a good place to stop. Is that a good place to stop? We think Caroline for. Thank you so much. Okay. So, let's have you come back into the audience and Michael, if you want to come up on stage. Pretty spry. Yeah. This is your left year, I think. Right ear. And then turn it on. Okay. Wow, there's an audience here. And then of course, if you have questions and you want to make comments later after we dialogue a little bit about this, then please use the microphone so people will be able to hear. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Will you want to comment first from your own perception? 

00:42:40
JEFFREY ZEIG I, I will comment, but I think it's better to, to have you comment. 

00:42:45
MICHAEL YAPKO You want me to comment first. 

00:42:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:42:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Uh, you know, Caroline said it was a really good session, and that's the bottom line. So I can, I can talk about some of the technical things, and I can talk about some of the things that I would have differently. 

00:43:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, please. 

00:43:05
CAROLINE Uh, but, in terms of all the technical stuff, how quickly you jumped in to doing the, the hypnosis. I thought it was a really nice start, the way you started embedding expectancy right off the bat with, "So what would make this wildly successful." Not just successful, but wildly successful. And of course, it puts her in the frame of having to think about the possibility that it could be wildly successful, and it starts to establish a goal. That there's a reason why were here. There's a reason why were doing this and trying to delineate what that goal is. And truly, any hypnosis session is only as good as the definition of your goal. That if you're not aiming at something relatively specific, it can go in a million different directions. And so I was glad at how explicit you were about wanting to define what the goal was. And then she told you about the, the accident and the trauma to her foot. And, as soon as she said, "All things happen for a reason." That's where I would've gone right away. You know, that is a global over-generalization that is potentially extremely hazardous viewpoint to hold. And as soon as you believe all things happen for a reason, then it absolutely requires you to start considering possible reasons. And if what you come up with our positive interpretations, that will cheer you up. But, if you start viewing it as punishment and you start viewing it as, you know, self-destructive and all these things that end up harming yourself esteem and working against you. 

00:45:00
JEFFREY ZEIG What would you have done? Would you have used a confrontation at that moment? 

00:45:00
MICHAEL YAPKO No, I wouldn't have used confrontation, but I would have wanted to ask the question that, these, these are what I call discrimination questions. That when someone has this kind of over generalization, when isn't that true? I would have asked the essence of that question, you know, are there times when things happen where there really is no reason? Are there times that symptoms are just symptoms? Are there times when a foot is sore just because it got cut? 

00:45:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And accidents just happen. 

00:45:35
MICHAEL YAPKO And accidents just happen, but to, to want to then establish the greater goal of being able to take this global thought process and start to add some texture to it. That there are times when this accident really is a message that you're rushing, and you're careless and you need to do, take better care of yourself. And then there are other times when accidents are just accidents. And, isn't the whole idea of then to deal with the consequences of an accident without having to go through all the self blame or without turning it into an existential crisis. So, I, I would have wanted to, to address that issue of how you tolerate the ambiguity and how you protect yourself from making interpretations about ambiguity, projections about ambiguity that are self damaging. You know, one of the things that is well established in the literature for most people who are most prone to anxiety, people most prone to depression is they don't recognize ambiguity very well. They immediately start making interpretations and then believing their own interpretations. And of course, the problem is when those interpretations are self injurious, when they're, they're turned against the self. So, I, I would have explored more about that whole process of projecting meaning about what's that that about. And then, you know, because of microphone problems you came back to the, reiterating the question, okay, so let's come back to what would be an outcome for a wildly successful session? Uh, the global philosophy and the discrimination was really the thing that I would've gotten to. But, it's, it always raises that tough question, when do you accept somebody's viewpoint and when do you challenge somebody's viewpoint? And there's the finesse. And, for me that's one of the greatest uses of hypnosis is instead of having to have that direct challenge of, hey wait a second, you may be reading too much into this or you may be attributing things to it that are truly appropriate to attribute to it. To use the hypnosis as a way of promoting that cognitive flexibility. So here, here's what I mean by. She's presenting the problem of the pain, the pressure with each step and the meaning of, of what that's about. And, your process utilized that, and, and you had her talk to her foot and get more messages from her foot. And reinforce that whole notion that this has meaning, and now let's expand the meaning. Great utilization. And another possibility of course is when we, when we talk about meeting people in their frame of reference, it doesn't mean that we necessarily stay there. So, another therapeutic possibility would've been to move from that physical sensory awareness and that physical contact to addressing the larger cognitive part of this. You know, the danger of not recognizing ambiguity, the danger of projecting into ambiguity. And for me, I think, I would have gone in that direction because how many more accidents is she going to have in her lifetime? You know, if you're alive, things happen. You fall down. You get cut. You get bruised. You break a leg. You trip on the carpet. All of these, these things that she's going to suffer more injuries in life just inevitably. But, here's also where a piece of history would've been valuable to me. You know, it's one thing if you are accident prone, and your constantly falling and bruising and cutting and breaking versus if this is a relatively isolated episode. So, I, I never had any sense of is this something that happens regularly and this is why she's dealing with it on the existential level of what it all means in her life or whether this is a relatively isolated episode and it stands out for that reason and she goes looking for it, for what the meaning is. So, I think it would've been valuable to not only have that history about how often does this kind of thing happen to you. And, it would've been a huge resource to use if she had said, "I can't remember the last time I injured myself." To, to be able to use it that way. But, to make that shift into the cognitive part of the process wouldn't have precluded the sensory awareness, but would have, I think, added the extra element of in the future when these things happen to you or to somebody else, because the other piece of this is I also don't know the interpersonal consequence. That's when you're Doctor holds the believe that all things happen for a reason, I would love to know does that get communicated to your patients? That if a patient comes in and has a symptom, has a problem, has an injury do you then say, "Well, what's going on in your life that this happened?" To me it's the equivalent of, you know, I'll catch a cold once every two years. And when people come up and say, "So what's going on in your life that you caught a cold?" My immediate response is violent. You know, there, there are viruses out there. There are bacteria out there. And guess what? You know, I may be pretty strong constitutionally, but I'm not immune to things that affect human beings. And I don't want to read into why I caught a cold. It happens. And, I think that that would have been a containment strategy for that, that kind of belief system. The, the transition into the induction was so quick and it was because she was already there. I mean you were just. I, I really appreciated how quickly you jumped right into it and didn't bother with all the Mickey mouse stuff. It just wasn't really necessary. And, I, I thought that the way that you were able to deal with her, the feelings, the fear and the trembling and the message. But, when she came back to saying the trust is in my heart, for me I, I would have viewed that as a limited way of moving through life. Because I also want you to trust your brain and your thought processes, and I want you to trust your observational skills about yourself and other people. And I want you to expand the number of things that you can trust so that you're not just trusting your heart, because the reality is how often do feelings lie? I mean there are people out there who say trust your gut, trust your feelings. But, feelings lie. And, you know, how many of you have ever fall in love with the wrong person? You know, feelings lie. You, you can trust people who shouldn't be trusted. You can believe things that really should be believed. And so, to, to me, having that multiple level check system of here's what my gut is telling me, but here's also what is represented on a more factual level, and being able to have that interplay between them. 

00:53:45
JEFFREY ZEIG This is why we went outside at the end, to bring in the head part. 

00:53:50
MICHAEL YAPKO At the end. Exactly right. I was coming to that. That was at the very and, and to me that that was the piece that tied it all together, was as soon as you got her up and over looking at the other perspective, and actually used that language about use the thoughts. I thought that that came very late in the process, but it was there, and I thought it was a critical piece to, to be able to, to put in there. You know, you were so respectful every step of the way that the check ins were constant. I'm always amazed at how many people that have been doing hypnosis for 25 years and never talk to the person during hypnosis. And of course, the only feedback you have is this person. So, that, not only did you demonstrate check ins, but constant check ins. And, and that ability to stay connected to her and continually ask not only for her feedback about what was going on inside, but her feedback about you and your position with her. And, I thought that was superb modeling of what it means to stay connected to someone. But, I think that, you know, what else would I have done differently? By taking that, addressing that question of placing meanings where it is potentially hazardous to place meanings. I think that's how I would have responded to, and as you lift the burden of meaning it'll reduce the pressure with each step that you take, and was ultimately reducing the pressure of each step that she was looking for. Uh, and then at some point towards the end, she ended up getting to the exact same place anyway when she said, "I don't need to do anything. I don't need to worry about what it means." Which you were very quick to reinforce. That was when you then introduced the to go from "O" to "E", from I've got to to I get to. And, when you reinforced getting to be more tender with yourself and anchoring yourself. That was really great. When she talked about her, and then towards the and again, she came back to the notion of her foot got stabbed in battle. And to me, that was kind of a full circle again of this still has a deeper meaning. This still has a more profound meaning, and I, I think that at that point it became a really critical thing to help her step out of that, and I was really glad when you did because that was almost the point where you ended it, and then said, "Let's step up and get a more cognitive perspective of all of this." So, the other things that I wanted to know about were about her expectations. Does she expect it to heal? And, and that she, or does she expect there to be a lingering process from this? Is this, is this in other words, a temporary situation or is this going to turn into something that she views as being, this is going to be a constant reminder? And then to be able to give some kind of posthypnotic suggestion about how every time she looks at the scar that there is a reminder of the key lesson that you're trying to, trying to teach her. But, that, that ability to, to expand the trust to other parts of yourself. And then when, when you summarized it as no need for excess psychological message from your foot. And she said, "Yeah, I can thank my foot." Then you said, "You can use your head a little bit differently. Take the perspective, some cognitive structure." There was the suggestion for that dissociation that needed to be done. Let's step away from the usual frame about this and look at it from another perspective. And then, you know, when you checked in with her at the end and said, "How's it been?" And she said, "It's been profound." What else can you ask for? So, very nicely done. 

00:58:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Excellent supervision. And if that was a model for how to do supervision, that would represent it because it's the detail and the specificity, taking these copious notes and having a reference point from which to proceed. So, that's really excellent. And then, the, you know, the story line and how you take the story line. And that's a reflection from Eric Holster(ph) that both Michael, who both Michael and I admire greatly. So, there's many places where you pick up the story line and you can take the storyline in one direction or another. And, the idea of challenging the, the global, the, the projection into the ambiguity, right? So, that would have taken the story line in a different direction, and I can't say that I thought about it. I cannot say that I thought about it at the time because at the moment I was really interested in just challenging myself that Caroline is a more global thinker then I am. And I think in more specific terms. So, I'm trying to challenge myself at that moment to meet her at her frame of reference and get into her reality. And, then where the difficulty comes for me is that if you're doing psychotherapy for someone, the contract that you have for doing psychotherapy allows you to comment on aspects of who this person is, personality structure. When you're doing a demonstration, the demonstration is more tightly structured around trying to accomplish a goal. And focusing on the goal. So, so I didn't know exactly if it, if in a demonstration trying to comment on the way in which she may attribute into ambiguity would be something that would be really right, and I'd have to think that through, and I didn't have enough time to be able to really think that through. But, I think that if you would have taken that, and you would've made that into the storyline, and you would've made that into the central theme, that it would have probably taken the therapy in a different direction and would have been, you know, intensely useful for Caroline. The idea of getting the history was really valuable to me too, and I started on that point, "Would you say that your reckless person?" And then I didn't pick up on that. And in retrospect, hindsight being 20/20, I think that I should have fleshed out that part of the storyline more. 

01:01:05
MICHAEL YAPKO I actually wrote that as a comment that you were asking in the direction of, without getting the specificity. 

01:01:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Right. That would've been a great thing to pick up on and to, you know, flesh out that part of the storyline more, because she started to say something in relationship to how other people's perspective of her in relation to her work. But, I, I don't remember what happened immediately after that that took me off of that course. But would, would she be defining that as an identity, not just the history, but the identity of being reckless and with that, that would've taken us in a good place. So, I wish that in retrospect I would have followed up on that. But, it wasn't going to occur to me to take any, any of the attributions that she might make about the meaning of incidents and make that into the central focus of were to take the therapy. It would, again, I think it would have been really fine to take it that way. So, if I were commenting on my own work, and I'm, you know, sitting outside it, the, and using it also for teaching purposes, the idea of getting a clear description of the outcome, a solution focused outcome. This is something that is really important, because the person comes in and the person is ready to talk about the complaint or to talk about, present the complaint or to talk about the problem. And so, keeping the person focused on what is it that you want to envision as your outcome. If this session is wildly successful, where, where is it that you will be? Until you can get an adequate video description of the outcome. And then, what Michael was saying about the attenuation of induction. Right, that there wasn't so much of a need for induction. And that became evident in the first few nanoseconds of the interaction, because in the first two nanoseconds of the interaction it's like I'm making a gesture, and Caroline is making the complimentary gesture. And this happened twice, where I made a gesture, Caroline made a complementary gesture. Now at that moment, I say, you know, we are in a state of mutual responsiveness. And, if, if that state of mutual responsiveness is the sine qua non of the goal of the induction, that the goal of the induction is to get into a state of responsiveness with the person responding to the meaning of the communication. Well then there's no sense in doing a detailed induction, because the person is already responsive. The purpose of the induction is to develop responsiveness. So then immediately, it's easy to move into the utilization phase of hypnosis rather than having to spend time in the induction building responsiveness. She was responsive to me. I was responsive to her. We were in a mutually responsive state. Then the therapy can move from there. The interesting challenge to me again was about this idea of me having a very different style of thinking than Caroline. And that I have to challenge myself to meet her at her frame of reference, to move into her reality and to try to use her language and her reference points and her ways of seeing the world. And to try to, so that I am focusing through her lens. And I thought that was challenging to me and a little exhilarating to me, to try to get there when for example, if you are in Japan and the customs are so different. And you know that using big gestures when you speak is considered very rude, that you would try to restrain yourself and you would try to use some of the, as best as you could understand, the customs of that reality. Well, I was trying very hard to use the customs of Caroline's reality. And, even though they diverge differently from mine. So, yeah, thanks. 

01:05:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, there is, there's the circularity of it. You adapt yourself to her, but then the whole idea is she needs something expensive. So at the same time, challenging her to expand her view to come to yours. Using the strength of that alliance to make that sort of thing happen. There, there's always that flowing, that rhythm with each other of do I narrow myself to the self limited perspective that you have now, or do I invite you into something that's more expensive? And, you have to do both. You have to do both, and I think you demonstrated that very well. 

01:06:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. And, let's take some thoughts from, from the audience. Yeah. 

01:06:15
UNKNOWN First of all, I want to thank you both for doing this. It is so wonderfully informative, and I love the way you're both being very open about it. And also Caroline, the connection that you had with her, Jeff, I really sensed the extreme respect and presence that you had with her all the way through. The moment that you were talking about earlier, Michael. Do you think that you are a reckless person? In my notes, and I don't know how accurate this, but in my notes shortly after that, Caroline did something that she did frequently throughout the session, which was go to your comments, which was go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." And, like she needed to go on to something else. 

01:06:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Kind of dismissive about it. 

01:06:55
NARRATOR And shortly after that moment, I believe I heard Caroline say this, and Caroline, you can correct me if I'm wrong. I've spent 30 years being a doctor, and now I'm giving it up. And something in that moment changed in her. And you responded to it very compassionately. You said, "Now take your time. I think you're getting closer to yourself." Shortly after that, it went back to the foot and the globalizations about the head and the foot and all that. Can you comment on that moment? 

01:07:30
MICHAEL YAPKO First let me say where it went was after Jeff asked that question, "Do you see yourself as reckless or thoughtless?" she came back with talking about separating doing from being. Here's being. There is doing. And then, they went off in that direction. 

01:07:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, thank you. 

01:07:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And, and she came to the conclusion I am not what I am not what I do. 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN But yeah, I'm not what I do. And that in the context of I've been a doctor for 30 years and now I'm giving it up. 

01:08:05
JEFFREY ZEIG The insistence is that people, people say their words and they may not feel the import of the words that that they're saying. So, if you slow the person down a little bit so that they're not just breezing through the words, and they can begin to, to, psychotherapy is an unusual time when you can really get the felt sense of what it is that you're saying. So, slow the person down and make sure that they get the experiential reality of what they're saying, and they're not just dismissive or perfunctory about their own thoughts. 

01:08:45
UNKNOWN For me, that was the most powerful moment in the entire session, because it seemed there was a real moment there, and you even commented on it. 

01:08:55
JEFFREY ZEIG She was feeling a lot, and the expressions that you might not have been able to see. She was feeling them. She was feeling those moments, and so I was just trying to track her facial expression and tears and expressions of emotions and stay with her while she was in that process. Please, next. And it's good to keep the comments brief like that. That's really great so that we can interact quickly and make sure that everybody gets a chance to be heard. Okay. 

01:09:25
UNKNOWN I was kind of struck by the issue of changing someone's frame of reference on the one hand. And then on the other hand, kind of focusing on achieving an outcome that the client desires. So, I could see that sometimes is in conflict. And that you also would have to take into consideration the amount of time you have to work with the client. Can you comment on that, how to maybe balance both? 

01:09:50
JEFFREY ZEIG I, you know, my way of doing that here would be not to challenge the person's, you know, frame of reference. Not for demonstration. But, in a psychotherapy session I would feel like I had much more of the, the understanding that that would be fair game, to, to challenge the person's frame of reference. And if the person, if I thought that the person's frame of reference was just so terribly wrong, then probably I would challenge it even though it was a demonstration. And I think it would've been absolutely fine to go in that direction that Michael was suggesting. And that part of this is an aesthetic, and it's where you take the story line. And each therapist is going to have a slightly different perspective on where to take that. You know, if you go to and you see, oh, that's great, if you see ten, if you have a bacterial confection. I'm getting a little distracted. If you have a bacterial infection, and you go to ten different doctors, they're going to say to you you have a bacterial infection. You need an antibiotic. Everybody's going to be in general agreement. But, if you have a problem like depression and you go to ten different therapists, they are going to tell you ten different things. So, one of them is going to say you need to change your attitude. One of them is going to say you need to change your thoughts. One of them is going to need to, say you need to change your relationship problem. One of them is going to say that it's an existential crisis. One of them is going to say that it's a problem that has to do with your, that depression is really anger turned inward. And you're going to get ten different perspectives. So, therapy is not the science that medicine can be, where there's an easy algorithm and there's a lot of aesthetics that go into it, aesthetic choices about which way the therapist will, will take the session. So, where the question is not so much what would be right. With Michael's way of going about it be more right to that my way of going about it in the moment? It would be what's your way of going about it, and where would you take it, and what would be the aesthetically right choice for you? Because, to me, there's not a, as much science to it as the literature would seem to indicate. 

01:12:10
MICHAEL YAPKO I want to, I need to comment on that. First of all, the framing of calling it challenging a person is very different than pointing out to someone the limitations of a particular belief system, pointing out that there are times when that particular belief system doesn't really operated as true. It isn't as much a contradiction as much as it is a clarification, by helping the person develop a sense of where the boundaries are of this particular belief system. So, Jeff is using the word challenge, but that, that wouldn't be the way that I would describe what, what I was talking about. But, he's reiterating the other key point that I made before we even started this whole process this morning. Is that there are many different ways of approaching something, and when I said you might have approached it in a way that was different that worked as well or better, I was sincere in saying that. 

01:13:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:13:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. I thought that her response to you, Jeff, and what you were doing was beautiful. It was elegant and went exactly where she wanted to go. There were a couple of things that I heard, and they referred to, do you want to know what this is about? She said that a couple of times? And, that, I got stuck there myself. Could you comment on sort of moving away from those things and focusing in a different direction, because I, I had never seen that, and it was right for her. 

01:13:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, the, the poetry of her language was, you know, somewhat global, and so just trying, okay, I think that's a perfectly wonderful way of experiencing the world. So, I was just trying to keep up and challenge myself to try to understand the way that she was seeing the world, the way that she was understanding things. And some of the time I didn't understand. And those were the times when I really tried to ask and specify and clarify, you know, more specifically what was going on. And, and then Caroline, you know, was able to go there, and say, and help me to better understand the way in which she was feeling things through. 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN Then after you passed by those things, she went into this lovely song. And I thought, boy, I'd better learn more about what he's doing. 

01:14:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Thank you. 

01:15:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And it proves that hypnosis does enhance singing ability. 

01:15:00
UNKNOWN I have a question about the fundamental strategic choice that you made in dealing with her. The conversation was all about the foot and the connection with the head and heart to the foot. Caroline is clearly a very empathic person, and she's also obviously very intelligent and articulate. 

01:15:25
JEFFREY ZEIG She has a lot of married neurons. 

01:15:30
UNKNOWN And my sense was that she was reporting on herself all the time. 

01:15:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Reporting? 

01:15:35
UNKNOWN Reporting. My feelings are this. I've always thought this about my foot or about these kinds of things. And that it was a very cerebral rational kind of interconnection. And that even when she obviously seemed to be entranced, the brain, the cerebrum was clearly highly engaged. And, as Beethoven teaches us, it's better to have the feelings engaged and to bypass the brain. And, if it had been me, I would have gone into storytelling or something that would go past the rationality to approach it. Was this ever a consideration of yours as opposed to dealing with the problem overtly and directly? 

01:16:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, for me this a consistent challenge, because I tend to be so cerebral. You know, so my wife is wonderful in that regard and keeps me, you know, focused on more of the emotional world. And, so I, I didn't feel like that, this particular session I got lost in cerebral concepts. To me it felt much more emotional and connected, so if that's the way that it came across to you, that's, you know. 

01:16:50
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm curious about that myself, cuz I feel like it was anything but cerebral. I felt like she was really speaking from her feelings and really speaking from her heart. And Jeff stayed with that. And, you know, that I was saying I would've liked it a little more of a cognitive element to it. So. 

01:17:05
UNKNOWN I didn't, I didn't get that she was, uh, lying or creating things. They were accurate, but it was reportage as opposed to like really being there. That's just a sense that I got from her style. 

01:17:20
MICHAEL YAPKO In, in a sense, there's always going to be a gap. As soon as you describe a feeling, as soon as I say I am angry, you know, you've now lifted it out of the realm of feeling and you're reporting on it. I mean, you can look at it from that point of view, but I, I actually think Caroline was very connected to what she was feeling. And I think Jeff was right there with her. 

01:17:40
UNKNOWN I was sitting too far back. 

01:17:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, interesting. 

01:17:40
UNKNOWN Thanks. 

01:17:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Sheldon? Do you know Sheldon? 

01:17:45
MICHAEL YAPKO I do. 

01:17:50
SHELDON This is, this is obviously a beautiful demonstration of both therapy and supervision. With 100 people here we probably we had 200 different ways that we might proceed. Jeff is really tuned in from yesterday, because when the outstanding musicians like a Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell(ph), to Atlanta, they give master classes. Let me just tell you a little bit about how I might have done this differently. As a physician, I would have talked to her and found out more about her foot, what she did. I notice when she came up there she was a very agile getting up there. She could step up there, which some of us could not do without using the steps. 

01:18:30
MICHAEL YAPKO She jumped off the stage. 

01:18:35
SHELDON Right, right. The same way. I might have started with what happened to you? 

01:18:40
MICHAEL YAPKO No pressure on your foot there. 

01:18:40
SHELDON Right. And what happened to your foot? And is a doctor I'd want to know what did you do? And, I might have said, if she said she elevated it, I would say, "Would you like to elevated it now while we are talking?" And I would have somebody bring a chair up, and have her elevate her foot. And I would let her focus, look at her foot, and she would have gone into a trance. I think when she was bleeding, she was in a trance as she watched the blood. How many people here would just sit and watch their foot bleed? And I might've said, "Maybe your unconscious knew you were coming here and you wanted to have a good excuse to , come up here and go into a trance. At any rate. 

01:19:25
MICHAEL YAPKO She just wanted a good excuse to come up and have a trance. 

01:19:30
SHELDON Yeah, anyway I thought this was fascinating, and as I said, there would be at least 100 different ideas about what people would do. 

01:19:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Thanks, Sheldon. 

01:19:35
MICHAEL YAPKO We are fully expecting her now to, we're fully expecting her now to have a closer relationship with her foot, where she even names each of her toes. 

01:19:50
UNKNOWN Just a quick comment on that last comment. I was a little curious too about the agility that Caroline showed in, in getting up there and coming down. When I saw her jump down, but I think she actually came down on a good foot. I don't know whether that's right, Caroline, but you can tell me. Yes, it was. Cuz, I suddenly thought, "My God, how could she jumped down like that?" But, no, no it's the left foot that's the one that is sore. But, the question I wanted to ask you Jeff, is a very simple one. Can you say something about your thinking with that little bit at the and, about changing an "O" to an "E", going from got to get. Could you say something about your rationale behind that, your thinking about that? 

01:20:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, the thinking about that was how would I set that up so that the thinking about that was that I was going to be a little mystifying. And, I was going to be a little destabilizing and distracting. And I was going to say something that she wasn't going to understand. And I was going to create a little extra attention at that moment. So technically, at that moment I was being strategic. I knew where I was going. I was going to make some, you know, vague reference, and then I was going to specify in a series of steps what I meant by that reference. And then I was going to see if that had emotional impact. So, that was, that was a strategic moment. Here's what I'm going to do. What are the, how am I going to get there? Step, step, step. Get there. 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN yeah, I was curious. In my mind, I thought, "Oh, this is a way of moving from the sort of symbolic to the, to the real statement. That's why I wanted to ask you. 

01:21:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

01:21:45
UNKNOWN Thanks for clearing that up. 

01:21:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, two more and then we will stop and take a little break. And then we'll come back and switch places. 

01:21:50
UNKNOWN I, I really enjoyed watching the whole process. I thought it was marvelous, but I feel kind of odd that all of us are commenting about the session, but Caroline isn't. I wonder if she would feel comfortable talking about her experience or if she'd rather just let it settle? 

01:22:05
JEFFREY ZEIG We would rather just let it settle, you know, in the best of all possible worlds, because it's an odd situation, to comment. Right, it's the joke about heaven and hell, the difference between heaven and hell is, you know, in heaven they tell jokes, and in hell they explain them. So that we, we want to be sure that, you know, we 'protect the person, but also it's a teaching situation. And we're going to learn by doing this. And I'm learning by doing this. I want to learn. I'm doing this for selfish reasons. To improve my own ability. 

01:22:45
UNKNOWN A couple of comments. And one is I was struck by the power of the dynamics that were going on within her and within you, and then between you. So, that sense of connecting with her, the compassion in that but also the need to not get so caught up in her dynamic that she didn't go anywhere. In other words, you stayed with her and she didn't want to stay where she was. In the, when you asked her the question about being reckless, I think part of her comment was not I'm reckless, but other people see me or see me as reckless. And then she went to what I think is a life transforming and perhaps for her, a soul transforming experience that must involve some grief. If she has invested herself for 30 years, now, and this may be my process that cognitively she's saying I got the message. Please don't give me any more pain. I don't need any more pain. And that was what she was asking to be different for her, that she could go back to walking and being without a grieving. 

01:24:25
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, I don't know that grief was central. It's certainly possible that that was part of the under structure. We would have just had to ask at the moment and try to wind down into you know, whatever feelings, like peeling the layers of an onion, like going down into the feeling structure. And maybe it could be shame, or it could be anger. It could be grief for it could be fear. We don't know, only that there is an undifferentiated tension that it might help to unwind and to understand what it was. 

01:25:00
UNKNOWN I saw the ambiguity. I also saw dissociation. Did anybody else see that? 

01:25:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Dissociation? 

01:25:10
UNKNOWN You know, in the sense of her emotions were going to be expressed through a body part, that cognitively she was, Caroline was assessing intellectually in her role as a physician. And they're just sort of hypnotically as somebody else suggested, watching her life blood, you know, flow out of her. And, her comment, "I was in shock." The, something I sensed also was when you brought her back to the goal. Is this bringing you where you want to be? I didn't see her comments, "Yes, yes, yes." as dismissive. I saw them as I've got that part. But, how do I connect to these other dissociative things that are there? I'm aware of them, but how do I integrate them? Okay. 

01:26:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, well I think that you're processing, how you, if you are in my chair, where would you have taken this in terms of feelings, in terms of cognitive processes? And I like what you are doing. And, you know, I'm just trying to connect that to me. I wasn't using the frame of dissociation at the moment to understand what was going on with her, nor was I trying, nor was I resonating with feelings, the same feeling structure that your resonating with about grief. But, you know, if you were sitting my chair and you were resonating with that cognitive structure, with that feeling structure, I think it would have been perfectly fine to ask about those things and pick up on those things and see where they took you. 

01:26:55
UNKNOWN I think in your chair, you are exactly where you were meant to be, doing what you are meant to do with her. And I don't mean that in a over globalization sense. 

01:27:05
JEFFREY ZEIG No, because Michael will challenge you if you do. 

01:27:10
UNKNOWN I thought he would. But, in the sense of dynamics, you know, being in the box and being in a box for 30 years that's filled with our life energy, and then, you know, the danger is that we can only switch places in the same dynamics. And I think what we want for the clients is to help them have access to other dynamics. 

01:27:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, that would've been another storyline. And again, it's which storyline you pick up on? Which storyline do you flesh out, and those are really difficult choices when you have some perspective then you are, you know, looking at things from a different point of view, you see different story lines in different ways, different things that you can pick up on. And so I think you are, your processing things, and you are teasing things out to try to understand where you would take things. I think that, I don't know how I can exactly resonate or help you with where it is that you're going. I think you're brewing something. 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN Well, I'm connected to what you did and mine is what my process was. Can I ask what is your sense? Did you reach a goal as you understood Caroline's goal. Did you have a sense that your expectation was met? 

01:28:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, my expectation was, you know, to try like, for me, making therapy into a more visual art. Into a more experiential art. To use more things that have to do with what's happening in your body than making therapy into cognitive process. So, anything that I can do that makes the moment come live experientially and how that, that after 40 years pretty much of doing therapy in in one way or another, actually starting in 1969. Working as a psychiatric orderly with schizophrenic patients, so it's been, you know, it's taking something and making it meaningful. And that I think that in the time that I spent with Caroline, we took what she brought and made it meaningful. And that's the, that's what makes it work for me. And then, you know, for me to have the opportunity to learn, and have the opportunity to practice my art and practice, demonstrate some of the things that I've learned, that I think are meaningful. So, if all those things happen, then, then it works for me. 

01:29:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:29:50
MICHAEL YAPKO One, one other comment I want to make about that. It's, it's also the limitation of one session meeting with somebody you've never met before. You know, one of the things that happens in the real world is, if this was the real world, Jeff would have a chance to see Caroline again and maybe again and maybe again. And each time it, it speaks to a different facet of what's going on. There is no illusion that Jeff is going to hit every facet of the issue or I'm going to hit every facet of the issue. But, if you ask the question did this session move Caroline forward, I think we could all say absolutely yes. And that's what makes it a good outcome. 

01:30:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So, on that note let's take a ten minute break. 

01:30:35

01:30:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, I want to, at least for my own demonstrations, establish a slightly different protocol here, because at the break I had no less than half a dozen people ask if they could be my volunteer partner in this process. And, I, I appreciate that, and it really seems to me the only fair way to do this is kind of a lottery. So, if, if you want to volunteer to be my partner in this process, if you would please write your name down on a piece of paper. Just rip off a small piece of paper and then we'll, we'll collect those and I'll have Jeff pick one at random. And, you know, I think that's the way to do it. You can hand the piece of paper to our key volunteer here. 

01:32:00
[sil.] 

01:32:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Raise, raise your hand if you're. 

01:32:15
[sil.] 

01:32:15
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm sorry? Yeah, of course, the reminder is if you've been a volunteer previously then do not volunteer again now. We really want to open it up to people. Okay, has everybody who wants to volunteer now given our volunteer the, their name on a slip of paper? Okay. They are being randomly shuffled right now, and Jeff is working. No, not a business card. A piece of paper so everybody's got roughly the same. Okay. We'll go with that one right there. 

01:33:10
[sil.] 

01:33:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Right. For you, for me, for whoever. I don't know. Susan Fisher. Who is Susan Fisher? That's Susan Fisher. Come on up. Hi, Susan. How are you? Have a seat. Let me help you get your microphone arranged. It's not all that tricky. It goes behind your ear there. There you go. Actually, let's put it in your other ear, because it's bending to the right, which means it will be closer to your mouth that way. Is that's okay? Great. Now, I'll turn that on. And you can either hold it or wedge it behind you. 

01:34:10
SUSAN FISHER I'll put it in my pocket. 

01:34:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. That'll work. Hi. 

01:34:15
SUSAN FISHER Hello. 

01:34:20
MICHAEL YAPKO What would you like help with? 

01:34:20
SUSAN FISHER Uh, I was programmed with hypnosis as a little kid, and I want to undo that. I want to let it go. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN Louder. We can't hear. 

01:34:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Something we can do to pump up the volume? 

01:34:35
SUSAN FISHER Okay, can you hear me now? 

01:34:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Okay. If you wouldn't mind starting again please. 

01:34:50
SUSAN FISHER Okay, as a little kid I was formerly programmed with hypnosis. And, about what, who I was and what my job was in life. And, I want to let go of that. I want to drop it away. I want to dissolve it. I want, I want to get rid of it. It still affects me. 

01:35:10
MICHAEL YAPKO What does that mean, "You were programmed with hypnosis"? 

01:35:15
SUSAN FISHER Uh, formally with many sessions over and over again, telling me who I was and what my job was. Uh, it was cultish. And, it still affects me today. I remember the programming, and the bottom line is they said if all else fails, you will fall asleep. So in other words, if their programming doesn't work, I'll fall asleep. And for some reason in this conference I have fallen asleep in every single session since Thursday morning. So, it's here, ready to be looked at and worked on. 

01:36:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Who did this programming? 

01:36:00
SUSAN FISHER A satanic cult. 

01:36:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And, how did they go about doing this exactly? 

01:36:10
SUSAN FISHER Uh, with hypnotic sessions. 

01:36:15
MICHAEL YAPKO More specifically than that. 

01:36:20
SUSAN FISHER Uh, they did a hypnotic induction, and then they just kind of rotely described, uh, essentially that I was nothing and that I belonged to them and I had to do what they wanted me to do. 

01:36:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, you're saying that occurred when you were a child. That somehow that has managed to persist all these years? 

01:36:50
SUSAN FISHER Uh, yes. 

01:36:50
MICHAEL YAPKO How? 

01:36:55
SUSAN FISHER I didn't even remember it until after my parents died. 

01:36:55
MICHAEL YAPKO How did that persist? How does that persist? 

01:37:00
SUSAN FISHER Uh, well, like in any kind of, anything that I identify as training, I will fall asleep. 

01:37:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you have an academic degree? 

01:37:20
SUSAN FISHER Yes I do. I hold a doctorate in psychology. 

01:37:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Did you fall asleep all the way through your doctoral program? 

01:37:25
SUSAN FISHER Yes, and I wasn't able to read it. So I was smart enough to be able to retain enough information to get licensed. 

01:37:35
MICHAEL YAPKO How did you do that? 

01:37:35
SUSAN FISHER Uh, basically I learned through listening and hearing. 

01:37:45
MICHAEL YAPKO The point is you learned. And you were awake while you are learning. 

01:37:55
SUSAN FISHER Yes. 

01:37:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And you learned things that I have to believe would have challenged previous belief systems. You didn't only learn things that you already believe, did you? 

01:38:05
SUSAN FISHER That's correct. 

01:38:10
MICHAEL YAPKO So, when you were faced with those contradictions, how did you managed to say awake? You don't know. 

01:38:20
SUSAN FISHER I don't really know. No. I'm just bullheaded and strong and determined and ornery. 

01:38:25
MICHAEL YAPKO All things that are going to be important to use here, aren't they? 

01:38:35
SUSAN FISHER Mm-hmm. 

01:38:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Bullheaded is good. Strong is good. 

01:38:35
SUSAN FISHER Resilient. 

01:38:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Resilient is good. Just out of curiosity with all the things that you've been learning along the way, how does a belief system manage to stay intact all the way from childhood? 

01:39:00
[sil.] 

01:39:00
SUSAN FISHER Uh, maybe because on some level I bought into it. 

01:39:10
MICHAEL YAPKO It looks like you're guessing now. You don't really know, do you? 

01:39:15
SUSAN FISHER No. 

01:39:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Not knowing is going to be important. Right? So, what else can you tell me about this. I mean, here you are at a hypnosis conference where hypnosis was apparently misused and misapplied in some way. What would lead you to want to be here? 

01:39:40
SUSAN FISHER Well people have asked me that, why I wanted to learn hypnosis if it was used against me. And I think the bottom line for me is to understand what, what did they do and how can I undo it? And how can I use hypnosis for good, since it was used for evil. 

01:40:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And have you learned about that? 

01:40:05
SUSAN FISHER Mm-hmm. 

01:40:05
MICHAEL YAPKO What have you learned? 

01:40:05
SUSAN FISHER Well I've, I've learned how to use it for good. I haven't, I haven't got the key to how to undo it completely. 

01:40:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And so, in volunteering to do this session, there's something you have in mind apparently, that you think I'd be able to help you do? What would that be? 

01:40:35
SUSAN FISHER There is some one last thread that is still holding this place. I need to be able to break that thread so that it can drop away. 

01:40:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And, what would happen then? 

01:40:55
SUSAN FISHER I'd be able to stay awake during trainings. I would, my view of myself I think would change. 

01:41:05
MICHAEL YAPKO How? 

01:41:05
SUSAN FISHER Because it affected my self-esteem and how I see myself. Yeah, I still am affected by what I had to do as a child. 

01:41:30
MICHAEL YAPKO To your way of looking at this, does anybody ever leave that behind? Do people break free from that? 

01:41:40
SUSAN FISHER Partially. I mean, some of them. 

01:41:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Some do partially or some do completely? 

01:41:55
SUSAN FISHER Of all the people that I have been in contact with and treated, I would say I'm probably one of the most resilient, but not but I don't know that I've ever seen anyone completely break away. 

01:42:15
MICHAEL YAPKO So, if somebody was going to break away, what would they have to do? 

01:42:20
SUSAN FISHER In the picture in my mind is, uh, like drop the black cloak that they wore. It's sort of like the Wizard of Oz, you know, where you see behind the curtain and it's, it's not as big and powerful as it was represented to a little child. 

01:42:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you think it was a good thing to peek behind the curtain? 

01:42:55
SUSAN FISHER In the Wizard of Oz? 

01:43:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Mm-hmm. 

01:43:00
SUSAN FISHER Mm-hmm. 

01:43:00
MICHAEL YAPKO They discovered there wasn't any magic. They discovered it was just a guy. There's a price to pay for giving up the image, isn't there? So, what does that mean? 

01:43:20
SUSAN FISHER Living more reality-based. 

01:43:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Determined by? 

01:43:40
[sil.] 

01:43:40
SUSAN FISHER I don't know. My head is lost right now. 

01:43:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And so, at this conference, at other conferences, each time someone has done hypnosis you've fallen asleep? Or have you not even participated in the hypnosis? 

01:44:05
SUSAN FISHER Well, this is the first time I've ever volunteered in all the years of trainings. 

01:44:15
MICHAEL YAPKO So you've been in trainings. You've watched other people go through the experience, but you haven't gone through the experience yourself? 

01:44:25
SUSAN FISHER Hm-mm 

01:44:25
MICHAEL YAPKO What about other kinds of hypnotic experiences? Other things that are absorbing and enjoyable? Do you somehow manage to keep yourself out of hypnosis at those times too? 

01:44:40
SUSAN FISHER Well, like if I go to the theater, when they turn the lights down I'll usually fall asleep at some point in the play. I'll do that at movies. 

01:45:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Narcolepsy has been ruled out? 

01:45:00
SUSAN FISHER Yes. Because it's selective. 

01:45:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And, you're sure about that? 

01:45:10
SUSAN FISHER Mm-hmm. 

01:45:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. So, if it's selective how and when would you select it? At a play, there's nothing threatening to you. 

01:45:25
SUSAN FISHER Uh, the material might be. If there's going to be... 

01:45:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Or not. 

01:45:30
SUSAN FISHER Or not, right, yes. 

01:45:30
MICHAEL YAPKO So, but that's my question is if you're falling asleep when it might be threatening, and you're falling asleep when it isn't threatening, is there any distinction? Do you know when you're being threatened? 

01:45:45
SUSAN FISHER Maybe not. Maybe I'm not. 

01:45:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Well then, in terms of this experience, is there anything else you think I should know? 

01:46:05
SUSAN FISHER No, I think that's it. 

01:46:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Well, then if I say to you orient yourself to the possibility of getting absorbed, is that threatening or is that reassuring? 

01:46:30
SUSAN FISHER It's reassuring. 

01:46:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, then let's go with it. 

01:46:35
SUSAN FISHER Okay. 

01:46:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Do what you need to do to give yourself a comfort that you want. Arrange yourself in whatever way is comfortable for you. If you feel better with your eyes open, keep your eyes open. Seems to me though, it would be really nice to be able to have the experience of being able to close your eyes and still be okay. And still know that you're okay. That's right. But, since your eyes do close as they are now, and since your eyes do open, and since you're really the one who is in charge, I'm perfectly fine with you opening your eyes once in a while. And particularly, if you know that you're at risk for falling asleep, well, somewhere during your doctoral program you would have learned that sleep learning kind of went by the wayside as research disproved it. So, I'm comfortable with you being just uncomfortable enough to stay oriented and stay connected. And it's not the kind of thing that given your whole history of avoiding these kinds of experiences, that I would expect you could just allow easily and effortlessly. But, then again given how resilient you've been, and how resilient you are. By your own self-definition, it's entirely possible that as you weave the fabric of this session. It's less about breaking the last string and more about using it within the fabric of creating experience of yourself, of your self image, of how you detach yourself gradually from what was. Now every once in a while, over the next few minutes, it's going to be important that you do small things that keep you connected to the best parts of your self. And whether it's the reassuring touch of one hand resting against the other, or whether it's the occasional eye opening, just to make sure everything is right where you left it, there comes a time, Susan, when each person is tasked with developing an identity and just how many identities are there in the course of a lifetime. Because before you could be a doctoral student, before you were a graduate student, you were an undergraduate. And before you declared your major, you were an undeclared student. And before you knew which university you were going to, you were a high school student. And all of the things that have changed who you've been and how you've been. But, it's a curious thing. Nobody escapes the forces of socialization, the power of the messages of other people. Because in the life of every child, from the moment of babies born and swaddled in pink, or blue society, well that's much too global. Individuals start the training process. People who grow up in a family where they are led to believe that they better play sports if they're going to fit into that family. Families that exert an amazing amount of pressure to train their kids to see one way or another. And when you've been through something as extreme as you have been through, the backlash is every bit as extreme. Of being absorbed in it, having it define you then reaching this point in your life, where you move farther and farther away. But, how old does someone have to be to start to discover for themselves what is real, what is true. All the kids who grow up with thou shalt not, and then around 13 they discover that they like it. And all the things that they have learned come into question. And how old does someone have to be to be a rebellious teenager or a rebellious therapist, a grown up who is barely housebroken. And someone discovers all the rules that don't apply to them. But, there's something much deeper than that. Much deeper than that. Because here is your moment, Susan. No one is going to hand you freedom. If you want it, you'll fight for it. Every hour of every day. I don't know whether you have much interest in history. History that goes back much farther than just the recent years. Or the early years of your life. But it's one of the extraordinary things about this country we live in. To have the history that we've had. I don't know if you've ever been to England. Most curious thing to see. it's like when you date somebody and then you meet their parents for the first time. And all of a sudden you see how this person got to be that way. In some ways and how clearly different they are, and what they grew up with. But our parent was England. And we were very happy to be protected by them in the earliest days of the colonies. And then something shifted. A literal tea party, throwing over the side. We were no longer willing to be taxed on. And to fight an improbable war, to fight against the best organized, best equipped army the world had known. A bunch of ragtag, barefoot in the middle of winter farmers with hoes and pick axes. But, they wanted it. They wanted it. And they were willing to fight for it. And every time one of those old images, one of those old ideas, one of those old cues that said you can fall asleep now. You get to say, in the most revolutionary of voices, I'm awake maybe for the first time. Deeply awake. Powerfully awake. And what's so revolutionary about that? It depends how you write the declaration of independence. And there's only one signature that matters on that one. But, you'll notice as I've noticed, how your breathing is changed. How you've done exactly what I was describing when I said staying connected to your hands, finger movements, eye movements that would guarantee even the subtle smiles from time to time. That guarantee you're not just winning battles, your winning the war. And every night when you turn on the news, and you hear something about the Tea Party, it's going to mean something quite different to you. Something that's much, much smarter than anything Sarah Palin might have said. And even though their motto is, "We want to take the country back.". Although they never quite say from whom, it's not unlike your motto of taking your life back. The threads have already been broken. The old and its curious, because you might have expected it to be something that occurs with flashing lights and noisy parades. But, if the deeper than that. The quiet confident knowing that you can be deeply awake. 

02:05:00
[sil.] 

02:05:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And you can take all of these flurries of statements that have come from the people who gave their lives for our freedom in building the country out of nothing. Regretting having only one life to give. And in your case, having a love for that life that builds hourly and weekly and monthly and yearly. And come every July 4th, you might let the country celebrate its independence while you celebrate yours every other day. Now, of course, I've been talking about detachments and of attachments by implication. Where the freedom is and what it means to realize that perhaps for the first time ever. That if you want your freedom, well, you know the rest. And out of all of these things that I've been talking about, I really have no way of knowing just which parts of you have joined the revolution. And so just in a moment, I'm going to check in with you and ask what you are aware of right now. And you describe that easily and effortlessly noticing how deeply awake you are all through this. Even more deeply with each word you say as you maintain your comfort while you describe what you are aware of now. Can you describe it, Susan? 

02:09:05
SUSAN FISHER Uh, it was an interesting process. You didn't tell me to break the string or I used it to gather up black velvet bag with all the accoutrements and symbols and everything. And, was carrying that along. Then it, it went along with what you were describing. It's changed into a garbage bag. And then as a teenager I could walk away from the garbage bag and say, "Fuck you.". And walk away. 

02:09:50
MICHAEL YAPKO But, if you're going to say that, you have to say it better than that. 

02:10:00
SUSAN FISHER Fuck you. And then, with the Declaration of Independence, it was, I always carried like an image or an identification with Dulcinea. And the Declaration of Independence, when you said something about that, I saw Dulcinea getting up off the dung heap and walking away and putting on clean clothes. And, and then with the Revolutionary War, I suddenly saw my brother as a young, he didn't, he didn't make it. He died in his early 20s. He didn't make it. He, he was there, sitting on a fence rail in that kind of clothing, cheering me on. And, that was very powerful. 

02:11:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Oh, that's beautiful. 

02:11:05
SUSAN FISHER So, oh, I guess at the Tea Party, I went and got the trash bag, and I then dumped it in the ocean, and watched it float away. So, I think this all has been very powerful for me. Very good. 

02:11:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. And, you're awake. 

02:11:25
SUSAN FISHER Mm-hmm. 

02:11:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Widely awake? 

02:11:25
SUSAN FISHER Wildly, wide, wildly awake. That's what I said. 

02:11:30
MICHAEL YAPKO That's good. If the Declaration of Independence makes you a wild woman, we'll just go with that. Widely awake. And deeply awake. And stay awake. But, you can certainly go back inside for a a few minutes now. To really be with, for this moment, the power of the things that you've just described. To be able to see and hear your brother cheering you on. That could well be the most memorable image of this whole process possibly. Or to hear "Fuck you" resonating through your brain when somebody is imposing something that really isn't even close to what you want to be. But of course, you know there are inside words and their are outside words. I am going to rely on your discretion, Susan. 

02:13:05
SUSAN FISHER I can be polite. 

02:13:10
MICHAEL YAPKO That's good. Someone who is house broken. This is a good thing. This is a very good thing. But all of these things, to be able to address something so serious and so profound. It's such a easy-going way. It's only possible for one reason. You are ready. You're ready to move on. Ready to cut the ties. And that doesn't mean unaware of them. It means doing exactly what you did, of taking that last string and using it as a garbage tie to be able to dump it. I'm sure there's a landfill somewhere that can use it. But all of the sincerity of describing the power of people who understand the meaning of revolution, what it means to break ties and declare a new day, a new order. And it means, something quite different now for the United States of Susan. Now how you will use that, will range from some relatively simple things of actually getting to see the whole play so that you can tell people how it was and being able to see the whole damn movie you paid for. And being able to have wonderfully hypnotic experiences that reinforce over and over again that when you go inside there's a lot of really good stuff in there. And when you know that. When you really know that, then you can start to bring this experience to a comfortable close, bringing back with you and leaving behind what makes sense to bring with you or to leave behind. And there are a lot of people who would end their hypnosis session by saying one, two, three, wake up. But, I'm not going to do that, because you've already been deeply awake this whole time. So, I'll just invite you instead to reorient yourself in a way that's easy and comfortable. Taking your time, letting your eyes open whenever you're ready. 

02:18:00
SUSAN FISHER Thank you. 

02:18:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi, Susan. Thank you. 

02:18:10
SUSAN FISHER I feel deeply grateful. This has been powerful. 

02:18:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Wow, I can only imagine. I can only imagine. I can. Amazing. Do you feel like talking about a little bit or would you prefer to just kind of let it sit? 

02:18:35
[sil.] 

02:18:35
SUSAN FISHER It just felt like whatever you are saying generated images in me that allowed me to let it go, to keep letting it go in different ways. And defend, I have survivor guilt about my brother. And to see my brother on the fence rail cheering me on, it was powerful. 

02:19:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Yes, it is, it really is. 

02:19:05
SUSAN FISHER And to say I don't have to be Dulcinea on the dung heap anymore, that changes my whole self image. 

02:19:20
MICHAEL YAPKO What are you going to say instead? 

02:19:20
SUSAN FISHER I'm not sure, but wild woman came to mind. 

02:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO I'll take it. I'll take it. Well, why don't we leave it there then, and just let it sit. 

02:19:40
SUSAN FISHER All right. Thank you. 

02:19:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Susan, thanks so much. 

02:19:40
SUSAN FISHER Thank you. 

02:19:45
MICHAEL YAPKO My pleasure. 

02:19:50
[sil.] 

02:19:50
MICHAEL YAPKO I think all I can say to that is wow. Thank you, Susan. 

02:20:10
[sil.] 

02:20:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Be nice now. That was a direct command, authoritarian style, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. 

02:20:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Do you want to, to first? 

02:20:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Uh, I'm just going to offer a global comment, and then we'll get into specifics. My global comment is what a privilege, what a privilege. 

02:21:00
[sil.] 

02:21:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I thought it was lovely. You really, you established a context for Susan to empower herself and to get exactly what it was that she wanted. And so, that was, you know, a very special moment that I'm sure is indelible for Susan. So, that was, you know, was as lovely as it gets. I would, you know, comment on some of the features of what you did. I thought that the, the softness and the gentleness was apparent right from the beginning. And you attuned yourself to the softness in gentleness of who Susan was. And that was very pretty. The difficulty with me was I'm half deaf. I really have a terrible hearing deficit, and finally I struck on this idea of having one of the volunteers repeat back the words so I'm better, a little bit better on the second half when I was on the first half. But, that softness was I think, mandatory for you to attune yourself. And, then the questioning is, was really lovely at the beginning, in terms of there's, there's a kind of, the more that we ask questions that are what and how, like how do you know that you'll be different? And what is it that really makes a difference for you? Rather than questions of do, do you know what will be different? Well, that allows the person to ask yes or no. That obliges a person to answer yes or no. So, when the questions are phrased in terms of what and how, those questions tend to open up rather than questions that begin with the word do. So, the vast majority of Michael's questions were with, in the form of, you know, what and how. What did you learn, for example. Rather than saying, "Did you learn anything?", which allows the person to say yes or no. What did you learn? So, that, that opens up the territory. And, then when we got into the hypnosis. The, the, there's a lovely nature of weaving. And the weaving is like establishing a thread. It's like a process of grading. So, you establish a thread, and maybe that thread is about creating a new self image, a new way of seeing yourself. So, you establish a thread. And then you begin to establish another thread. Establish another thread. And then you begin to weave those threads together into a cohesive whole. So, it's a matter of, you know, having a theme like Beethoven, and then establishing the theme, and then developing the theme, and then grading that together and interconnecting those themes. So that is, you know, really lovely. In addition to the loveliness of the ambiguity of other words. So, when you started and you said, you know, you got to the point of saying you were an undeclared student. Now, that could be understood in so many different ways in, in terms of how a person could possibly reorient themselves. And, yeah, oh yeah, I can have an epiphany around that one about being an undeclared student. Or, the idea of using the, the, we would call it a non sequitur, but what you call it when you say something is "burning cold"? What's that figure of speech? What? Oxymoron, thank you. I reserve the right to have senior moments at my age. So, the kind of oxymoron about being deeply awake. That's really lovely. And then, returning to that theme, bringing in that theme so that the essence of the trance is about waking people up is a part of the paradox of hypnosis, whereas we think about hypnosis, in terms of putting people to sleep or rendering them unconscious. Really, one of the purposes of hypnosis is to wake people up to resources. So, if were waking people up and we're using metaphors, uh, about the Tea Party and about American history. We are waking up a felt sense within the person, then that's hypnosis at its very best. So, little, little, those little themes like being an undeclared student or staying connected or even coming back to this idea of United States or you know, let's see, I can't find another concept there. But, those, those refinements of the ambiguous nature of language and establishing a momentum so the person can empower those ambiguities with a rich personal experiential meaning. I think that that's really lovely. And then the idea of doing a kind of naturalistic posthypnotic suggestion is really also a very pretty elaboration. So in traditional posthypnotic suggestion, it's like, "When I make this sound, you'll scratch your head." And so, that, that is classic hypnotic post, posthypnotic suggestion. But, in this sense it's more like when you get into your car and suddenly you put your keys in the car, and you start things up. And when you take the steering wheel, and you take charge and when you begin to give it gas, and when you begin to sense when you know that you can put on the brakes. Then, and so you're connecting with something that is natural in life to something that will be enduringly therapeutic. And those were lovely features of what, of what Michael did. And, then, you know, the moments of taking that theme of being deeply awake, building it to being wildly awake. I thought that was really lovely. And, let's see. The utilization of utilizing this idea of the string, and utilizing the string as a garbage tie. That's really nice. And, then the using humor. This was a feature of Erickson that was unknown prior to Erickson. And he would tell people jokes while they were in trance. Now, before Erickson, the use of humor in hypnosis. That was something that was really, the use of humor in therapy was really discouraged. When I was growing up in the field, you just didn't use humor in therapy. And then, gradually this has been something that has come to pass where humor is more used in the process of psychotherapy. But, nobody had used humor while people were in trance before Erickson. Now, he didn't have any problem telling people jokes while they were in trance. And Michael didn't have any problem joking while Susan was in trance. And that's a feature that we should remember because it's not like your unconscious mind is devoid of humor. Of course your unconscious mind has a sense of humor, and of course we can use humor within the warp and woof of trance. And then the loveliness of adding that feature of you know, being deeply awake at the and not going through a traditional ritual of awakening. And using that to cement in the features of Susan establishing her own reawakening and reestablishing her own identity. So, it's the momentum that is accumulative, of building up these little features, of building up this weaving. Building up these elaborations that get Susan to the, to the place where she feels empowered enough to re-create herself and re-create her life and reclaim who she is. So, I think that it was really beautiful, really lovely in the way you established all of those features, got into using metaphors. The metaphor of the, the Tea party and independents. You know, I think that anytime that you can bring presidential politics into play, it's hysterical. So, that's really great. You know, I think that if we got to thinking about what the things that I would do different, probably not much. You know, it would be elaborations on the theme. How would you make things come live visually for Susan? How would you use graphic images? How would you use your body to make things, live. You see me use a lot of gestures and making things come live visually. 50 percent of the brain is dedicated to visual processing, and I don't think we use enough visual elements in our therapy. So by consistently practicing trying to make concepts come live visually. And, so that would be a different stylistic difference, where I would try to take a concept, make it come alive visually. Could I make the idea of deeply awake come alive visually, and then maybe I'd find something to do it that way. The other commitment that I have for myself is to get out of the chair, and to conceive the therapy space as a stage upon which we can enact a symbolic drama of change. And so, probably a stylistic difference would be that I would find a way to get out of the chair. I would find a way to move around the room. I would find a way to make those concepts come alive visually. And, you know, maybe I didn't understand the part about the brother and the part about the loss of the brother, but I loved the fact that Susan brought that up as part of her understanding of trance. So, the therapist establishes a kind of climate, actually a skeleton. Just like a simple skeleton, that we create with our words in trance. But, the elaborations come from the patient. And we are just supplying the barest skeleton. So that when you talk to Susan, you find out what's going on with her, and you find out this wealth of elaborations that's going on inside her in response to what's really only a skeleton in your words. Her elaborations are really what makes the difference. So, we are supplying the simplest thing, but the perceptions, the memories, the associations, the images, all of those things are supplied by the patient in response. So, we can't make the trance interactive enough for really understanding the way in which the person is processing things so vividly. In comparison, well that when you're looking at Michael, it looks like he's being really elaborate. But, the elaborations of the patient are so much richer than any of the incredible elaborations that Michael could provide. And so, we need to check in often and find out what's going on. Then the idea of moving into the second trance, all right. It's not over, and we can have multiple trances. And it's not just, you have to have one trance, but okay, take the person out of trance. Find out what's going on. And then, whatever you get that's positive build it. So, a, under a fundamental foundational principle is whatever is positive, maximize the positive. Whatever is negative, find it way of circumscribing or minimizing it. A person says, "I'm happy." You are really happy. So, maximizing the positive. A person says, "Well, I'm tense." You're a little bit tense. Start to minimize the negative. Now, every generalization has its limitations, but in, in most cases this idea maximize the positive, minimize the negative. And you saw Michael do things like that peerlessly. So, that would be about all that I could comment on in relationship to what you did. I thought it was excellent. 

02:34:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Super. Thank you so much. Thank you. Really a treat to get your wisdom on this. So, I appreciate it. 

02:34:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Wonderful to watch your process. 

02:34:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. Let's open it up to questions if there are questions. Apparently there are. 

02:35:00
UNKNOWN I, I loved that little moment where you mentioned the United States of Susan, and it totally brought all of of historical stuff into a collection for her again, you know. It was, it was the simplest reinforcement of all the tale telling. 

02:35:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Ambiguity of those words and how much depth and meaning Susan could put into those words. It's, that's a beautiful metaphor. I'm sure lots of people are going to wind up using that metaphor to, you know, build up responsive sets. 

02:35:40
UNKNOWN Okay, I have, I have two little questions. At the the beginning, you said, you know, if you're having any kinds of problems or concerns, just open your eyes and see what's going on. And then, she stopped opening her eyes, and things were very serious. There was pin drop silence. And then you would you evoked Sarah Palin. And, what was interesting was that she made a grin on that. Was that a deliberate choice on your part to check in to see how she was doing? 

02:36:05
MICHAEL YAPKO There were multiple points along the way that I was, when I asked for the verbal feedback, but I'm also interested in the nonverbal feedback. You know, it's, it's harder for those of you who are sitting in the back. It's your misfortune really to sit towards the back, because if you can't see the facial expressions, then you don't know what were responding to. And that's the value of sitting up front and being able to see that the flickers of recognition across her face, the faint smiles when I talk about this or the deep breath when she completes this piece of it. But, the idea of let's, let's bring some humor into this, and you know, what's the best way to get a guaranteed laugh say Sarah Palin. So. 

02:36:55
UNKNOWN And the other quick question. 

02:37:00
MICHAEL YAPKO But, obviously it was linked to what I was talking about, the tea party, and the revolution, and the whole thing. 

02:37:00
UNKNOWN Was, when you had come to the conclusion of the historical material, you said detachment, attachment. That's really what were talking about. And, I'm wondering why you put that explanation of the tales in when the tales were totally communicating all of that perfectly. 

02:37:20
MICHAEL YAPKO The reality is you don't know when you use metaphor whether the person is going to get your intended meaning. People, metaphor is abstract language. It invites projection. And it happens routinely that people misinterpret metaphors or hear differently than you intended. You know, my favorite line. You, you tell this person and elaborate metaphor about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and all that, and they come to the conclusion that you just shouldn't eat fruit when you're naked. So, people will interpret things differently than how you had intended. So, there is the possibility on one hand of multiple ways of interpreting things, and on the other hand, here's one definite possibility. And, and it doesn't hurt anything by doing that. You're not losing anything by, by offering the possibility of one view of what you're talking about. 

02:38:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:38:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Steve? 

02:38:25
UNKNOWN That was wonderful, Michael. I think when asking for a volunteer, and they, then they tell you that they were abused by a satanic cult, my first thought would be let's draw another name. And yet, you very, without blinking, you just a very confidently and courageously bypassed any challenge of those beliefs and went into this idea of liberation, because that's what she wanted. She wanted to be liberated from this. And all of the metaphors about liberty and the process of getting liberated were just exquisitely lovely. That was beautiful, thank you. 

02:39:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. 

02:39:15
UNKNOWN Very beautiful, wonderfully done. I was wondering about her gestures, and I loved the truism that you started with, that one hand touching the other. And, I was expecting you to follow up at the end when Susan's fingers began to move, and her hands began to move in different gestures and coming together in a new way, a kind of steepling of her fingers. I thought you might have commented on that. 

02:39:45
MICHAEL YAPKO I might have. 

02:39:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Do you make anything of the change, because initially she was holding one hand. 

02:39:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Again, you can observe 100,000 things per session. How do you prioritize which things are worth commenting on? Out of all the deeper things that were going on in that session, the steepling of her fingers was number 983 to talk about. So. 

02:40:10
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. 

02:40:15
UNKNOWN I want to thank you all of you for these great conference. I think that you are great and every time that I come I find out that I don't know anything. 

02:40:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Me too. I have the same experience. 

02:40:30
UNKNOWN Your metaphor about history. Wow. It's amazing. I never would have think about it. How often do you use these kinds of metaphors? 

02:40:40
MICHAEL YAPKO That might've been in my lifetime the time that I ever made a reference to the American Revolution. I've always, it's just whatever, you know, here's the theme, you know. That, that if what you want is freedom, then how many different stories can you tell that represent how people get it? So that's, that's just what came. 

02:41:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And to underline that point. So, it's get the concept, freedom. And then you're allowing yourself to associate and what stories do you have about freedom. And then the elaborations like United States will come out of that by virtue of your own creativity. So, it's trusting that, the concept and allow the stories to flow once you get the concept. And then these are recursions. They are ways of building up that response set until the person realizes the felt sense of freedom in response to metaphor. We use metaphor once every 20 words in our speech without recognizing it. We use idioms and metaphors in our speech. And, this is, you know, part of human nature. So, it's a matter of recognizing the power of metaphor. I think it was Plato who said, "The thing most important by far is the command of metaphor." And, we just pick up from there. So, taking the concept, transforming it, getting the concept, allowing it to ferment inside you. And then you see what stories go up to you. And did them those stories will be elaborated in various ways as you surprise yourself about what things you say in response to that. So, it's not a matter of having to stockpile. It's a matter of having faith in your own ability to generate stories, because by the way, human beings are story making machines. We, we are geared towards responding to stories and remembering stories much better than we are to remembering facts. Okay? 

02:43:00
UNKNOWN And I have one more, one more comment. I would like Jeff, could you give us an example of visually graphic metaphors that you were talking about? 

02:43:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, visually graphic would be like working with Caroline, and then finding a way of externalizing and visualizing something that she was talking about or even moving my hands in parallel to her as, you know, making her concept come alive through a visual gesture. Lillian, my wife and I do things like sculpting. Like, like, an alternate thing in working with Susan might be to ask her to give me a sense of freedom. Okay, Susan. Think about that sense of freedom that you want to have. Give me that sense of freedom. I take that sense of freedom, and I say, "Okay, you know, where would you like to feel it in your body?" She says, "Okay, my heart." I say, "Okay, I'm going to put that sense of freedom in my heart. Now I'm going to stand up and I'm going to represent that sense of freedom. You direct me. Show me what I'll look like standing in that sculpture of freedom." And then suddenly, I'm taking that concept and turning it into a visual metaphor so that the metaphor is not necessarily verbal. This way, we make it into a living metaphor, a visual metaphor. Make that sense, live in a, in a visual term. And so, this is an area of personal exploration. It's an area where I'm curious and interested in seeing how quickly I can take the concept and not just transforming it into a story, although it's perfectly fine and can work incredibly beautiful, but transforming it into something living and visual because 50 percent of the brain is dedicated to visual processing. We have time for one more, and that we need to take a break for lunch. 

02:45:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:45:10
UNKNOWN I was wondering about two things. One is this that you used a couple of things in there, and I'm going like, "What the heck is this?" So, you used two terms. One was, you were talking about babies swaddled pink and baby blue. And then you used somewhere later on, and I didn't quite get this one, it was something like a parent barely housebroken. Something to that effect. 

02:45:40
MICHAEL YAPKO The first reference was when I was talking about socialization. That from the moment a child is born socialization begins. And traditionally in hospitals when a baby is born, girls are swaddled in pink and boys are swaddled in blue. And gender differences and socialization begin at that very moment. And of course, what I was making reference to was this was early childhood programming, and the whole idea was to be able to undo programming by talking about as you get older, and you start to evolve your own mind, and you declare, you become rebellious and then turning it as kind of a joke that you can even be a grown-up who isn't housebroken. That you can be rebellious. You don't have to conform to whatever standards you are socialized to. 

02:46:40
UNKNOWN The other question that I had was regarding, and either of you can answer, but, I'm more interested in yours, Michael. In your, what were you looking for in your assessment, when you are asking those questions? What, what were you asking for? What were you looking for?

MICHAEL YAPKO When you, when you are interviewing someone, what a good interview does is it builds momentum towards where the session is going. So, there's different styles of interviewing obviously. I like it that just picked up so quickly on how often my questions begin with how. I'm not interested in asking somebody why. All you do is get a theory from somebody about why they think they do what they do. And you know, big deal. So, as I'm up asking how do you determine this, how do you know whether it's this or that. Every time she hears herself respond to one of my questions with, "I don't know." It opens the door for what I can introduce. It starts to build responsiveness as she realizes here's something I'm doing every day, and I don't even know, have an understanding of why I'm doing this much less why I'm doing it, but how I'm doing it. So, it paves, it opens the door for me to then introduce possibilities. But, another style of interviewing that was also evident in that, you can interview people for their skills and for their resources, interview for what their strengths are. And you'll notice how many times I came back to Susan's use of the world resilience. I'll take it. And bullheadedness, reinforcing those things that she said about herself that were very nice things. But, the flip side of that is interviewing people for how they stay stuck. How does somebody get older but still persist in this one area of their lives. In other words, how does it stay the same. I want to know that too so that gives me better ideas of where I can introduce possibilities. So, those were the two parallel tracks of interviewing that I was modeling as I interviewed Susan. 

02:49:10

JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, and, uh, we, so we're going to continue the process. And, welcome back for the afternoon session. Same, same format, and I had a volunteer, Tracy. Tracy? Do you want to? And, we may need somebody on the microphone. So, left ear, Oh, I'm sorry, right ear. Oh no, left ear. Yeah, that's good. Okay. Okay. Let's try to get the sound. See how it is? It's a little bit, but it's bending the wire. Yeah, maybe, your ear. Can you help with the microphone? Help get the microphone set so that it's right? I have a hearing deficit, and I want to be sure that I can hear her. 

02:51:15
[sil.] 

02:51:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And then, and then you need to put that somewhere. Clip it. Okay. Okay, so you ready? Do you want to do a sound check for Tracy? Just say words. 

02:51:40
TRACY Testing, one, two, three. 

02:51:40
JEFFREY ZEIG We're good. Sound is okay. Okay. Okay, Tracy again, what is it that you have in mind to accomplish? 

02:51:50
TRACY Change my life. 

02:51:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, change your life. Just the basics? 

02:51:55
TRACY Uh, The structure of my practice and what I'm doing in it. 

02:52:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Okay and so, how is that a problem? To change your life and change the structure of your practice? 

02:52:05
JEFFREY ZEIG It's a problem because I'm growing my private practices to such a level that I don't have time to do anything else. And life is just going by me. And I want to create more and speak and write and teach and do workshops. 

02:52:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, so here is practice and here is life. And practice is filling life. 

02:52:40
TRACY Right. 

02:52:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And then you have some other things here that you want to do, to write and. 

02:52:45
TRACY Speak. 

02:52:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Speak. 

02:52:45
TRACY Do workshops. 

02:52:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, workshops. 

02:52:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Social media, webinars. 

02:52:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. Okay, and how is it that you prevent yourself from taking life and doing all these other four things? 

02:53:00
TRACY I think part of its fear of failure, rejection of some sort. And part of it is telling the people that I've been working with that I'm going to not have time for them anymore. 

02:53:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. The patients that you've been filling your professional life with. 

02:53:25
TRACY Right. 

02:53:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. And this extends to personal life or this is limited to professional life? 

02:53:30
TRACY Well, I don't have a personal life so. 

02:53:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Oops. Okay, so we just break for a minute. Right, now this is an interesting point. And, the point is gallows laughter. And, I don't say that in and of admonishing way, well maybe I'm saying it in a little admonishing way, but if I do, I apologize. But, people have a tendency of getting us to laugh at their conundrum. Right, like I'm fat, but I'm fat and happy. Ha ha Ha. And they get us to laugh at their predicament. And this is called gallows exchange. And it was pointed out to me for the first time in the writing of Eric Burne who was incredibly astute about social patterns. And so a gallows laughter, the metaphor is that the prisoners are going to go to the gallows. They're going to be executed by hanging the next day. And they're going, "Ha ha ha, I'm really going to stretch myself tomorrow." And they are getting, it's, it's humor about the predicament. Right? And so we need to be careful to be available and open to humor, but not it's, and it's really hard when people make really funny comments about their predicament. How do we hold a straight face? And how do we maintain our discipline and not subtly reinforce the predicament? So, I'm actually glad that came up because it often comes up when were doing demonstrations, and it's a good thing to mark out just as a teaching mechanism. Okay? So, okay, so now, extending that idea and how could we characterize that idea? You could say that you wanted to expand your options. Here is work filled with patients, yet you want to do social media and you want to do teaching. You want to do workshops. And here is your professional life and it's expanding. And then you think about personal life and how you might want to to extend that idea so that life is not just filled with patients, and you can do other things that you want to do. And you can do other things in other areas. 

02:56:05
TRACY Right. That's correct. 

02:56:10
JEFFREY ZEIG So, what would you call that? 

02:56:10
TRACY Balance 

02:56:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Balance. So, it's a matter of how to achieve balance in your life. 

02:56:15
TRACY With an emphasis on work. 

02:56:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And you want to emphasize the work part. How do I achieve balance and work? 

02:56:25
TRACY Yeah, cuz I love it. Right. 

02:56:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And balance may mean that you're extending your opportunities not just filling them with patients. Okay, and you are in a private practice or you work in an institution? 

02:56:35
TRACY Yeah. Private, very isolated. 

02:56:40
JEFFREY ZEIG It's isolated? But, incredible, wow. You are so successful that all of your time is filled up with patients. And, that's pretty heady that so many people want to see you, and so many people are eager to take advantage of your counseling and your advice. Wow. 

02:57:00
TRACY Yeah, I'm honored. I'm honored, and I can't complain. It's a burnout thing, I think for me at this point. It's been going on for a long time. And I'm trying to service it all. So, I need to change it. 

02:57:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so let's say that we do this sculpting that we had talked about before. And that you're going to, I'm going to stand up, and I really want to understand something about this conundrum that you have, which circulates around, centers around balance. So, I'm standing here, and right now I'm standing in neutral. And standing in neutral, I don't really represent anything. But, if we said, "Okay, Jeff, represent being caring." Then I could change my posture, and I could tilt my head and smile and look with a soft gaze and extend my hands. You could say that represents caring. Now, if you said, "Okay, Jeff, represent thinking." You know, I could take a pose and I could represent thinking. So, what I'd like to do, is I'd like to get the sense of what it's been like for you to be out of balance and fill life with patients. Uh-huh, and how can I stand that would represent sculpturally that posture? You don't have to do anything, just tell me. I want to get the felt sense of what it's like to be out of balance. 

02:58:40
TRACY You would be confined in a cylinder, but filled with light. 

02:58:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so confined, right? 

02:58:45
TRACY But, you're, you're warm with light at the same time. 

02:58:50
JEFFREY ZEIG How, how would we represent that contradictory, seemingly contradictory sense? 

02:58:55
TRACY I don't know. 

02:58:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Look at me, watch me. Right? I'm confined, now I can fill myself with light. How am I doing? 

02:59:05
TRACY It doesn't look like it's in alignment. 

02:59:10
JEFFREY ZEIG It sure doesn't feel in alignment. And how would I represent the burnout that could be. 

02:59:15
TRACY You got it. Well, the burnout? 

02:59:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

02:59:20
TRACY Exhaustion. 

02:59:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, because if the, just to give you my feedback about holding this posture and smiling incongruently in consideration to the tension that I'm carrying in my body, and I'm constrained and I'm confined and I'm holding myself really tight. Still trying to be luminescent and trying to project a light out into the world as I'm in the cylinder contained. And yet feeling like, "Oh my God, you know, could really burnout in this, this position." 

03:00:00
TRACY Yeah. 

03:00:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? 

03:00:00
TRACY But yet you're grateful for that position. 

03:00:05
JEFFREY ZEIG In some ways I can be grateful, because yeah. 

03:00:10
TRACY Maybe it's safe? 

03:00:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, if these people are coming to me, and I'm taking care of all of these people. Uh-huh. 

03:00:20
TRACY But, there's nothing more for me, which is what's missing. 

03:00:25
JEFFREY ZEIG That's what you see is missing? 

03:00:30
TRACY Yeah. 

03:00:30
JEFFREY ZEIG That I, I don't feel very supported in this posture. 

03:00:30
TRACY Right, absolutely. That's it. 

03:00:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And, there's something about it that I'm intent. I'll just give you my projection of what I'd like. I'm quivering a little bit, and you know, with the intensity of being confined. And I'm looking forward, and I'm smiling. Yeah, I can be appreciative of all of the things that are happening and still try to be luminescent, but I'm a little breathless. I really can't feel supported. I'm not supported with air. Uh-huh. 

03:01:10
TRACY Right. 

03:01:10
JEFFREY ZEIG So, let me stop for a minute. What's it like to see that representation of yourself? 

03:01:15
TRACY It feels accurate. 

03:01:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. That's what it, it looks accurate. How does it feel? 

03:01:30
TRACY It feels limiting. Limited. Uncomfortable. 

03:01:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Something poignant about that? 

03:01:40
TRACY Yeah. The question is is this the, is this where you want to stop? 

03:01:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

03:01:50
TRACY What about the other stuff that you dreamed about? And why have you been talking about this for years, a couple of years at least and not doing anything. I think the answer is I've been growing my practice to another practice. And that was the goal. It's just every year goes by, and I'm getting older and want to get out there, make a difference in a different way. 

03:02:20
JEFFREY ZEIG I want to make a difference. 

03:02:20
TRACY A difference in a different way. 

03:02:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I want to make a difference in a different way. Uh-huh. Okay, so now let me stand up again, and I'll come over here to the right. And now, I represent balance, and now I want to represent making a difference in a different way. Okay, so what, what could I do? How could I stand that would represent the goal of what it is that you want, where you are extending yourself in your professional life and perhaps, we don't know. 

03:02:55
TRACY Well, your arms would be extended up and out. 

03:03:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Up and out. Uh-huh. 

03:03:00
TRACY And you'd be stretched tall, and you would be smiling. 

03:03:10
TRACY Okay, so, you know, scoot back just a little bit so that you can get a perspective on this. How am I doing about representing balance and extending yourself in the way that you've been promising yourself for years? Uh-huh? How am I doing it representing that? 

03:03:30
TRACY I don't know. 

03:03:30
JEFFREY ZEIG What can I do that with increase this and make it a little bit more accurate? Raise my hands? Lower my hands? Move my feet forward? 

03:03:40
TRACY It feels like a mood has changed, but not the diversity in the overall technique. That hasn't necessarily changed. 

03:03:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so something more that I could do to represent diversity is that I could be mobile. I could move here... 

03:03:55
TRACY You could jump. 

03:03:55
JEFFREY ZEIG ... And there and here and there. What? 

03:04:00
TRACY You could jump. 

03:04:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Jump? Yeah. 

03:04:00
TRACY From here to here like and Alice in Wonderland. That works. 

03:04:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And then I am representing that the balance, that movement, that diversity. And what's it like for, to? 

03:04:20
TRACY Much more fun. 

03:04:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Much more fun. Uh-huh. What's it like, and what does it, what's your sense of seeing me represent you living your dream? 

03:04:30
TRACY It's wonderful and scary. 

03:04:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Help me to understand. What's the scary part? 

03:04:40
TRACY The ambiguity of how it's going to be received. 

03:04:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Uh-huh, so and you can't know how you'll be received. There's a few ways that we can always make a fool of ourselves, and one way that's most sure is predicting the future. But, there something intriguing about that. And that the reference that you have for doing something that is a little bit intriguing, may be terribly intriguing and a little bit frightening. There's lots of references that you have. We can come back to that. Okay, so being over here and doing that and being here, right, and here and here and here and here. 

03:05:40
TRACY Dancing sort of, yeah. 

03:05:45
JEFFREY ZEIG yeah, and the interesting part is what I'm doing this and I'm... 

03:05:45
TRACY But, you're not alone either. You, you'd have a partner. 

03:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. I didn't understand. 

03:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG You'd have a partner. You wouldn't be dancing alone. 

03:05:55
JEFFREY ZEIG I, I don't have to dance alone. I could be dancing with a partner. 

03:06:00
TRACY Right. 

03:06:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Was that over here? 

03:06:05
TRACY No, it's over here. 

03:06:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Okay. And then take a moment, and what I'd like you to do is just take a picture that, but not taking a picture of me. Take a picture of you and imagine that you're here, as a matter of fact just to get the feel, and so I can get a different perspective, let's have, but to do a switch for a moment, okay? And, you come over here for a minute. 

03:06:35
TRACY Am I standing? 

03:06:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, yeah. I'll come over here. And then show me what that looks like for you to be in that posture. That you're living your dream professionally, achieving what it is. 

03:06:55
[sil.] 

03:06:55
JEFFREY ZEIG I can't model that. But, what was it like? 

03:07:05
TRACY Fun. 

03:07:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Really fun. 

03:07:10
TRACY Fun. 

03:07:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Exhilarating. 

03:07:10
TRACY Yeah. I exaggerated what I see everybody doing. 

03:07:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, it was very well done. And this is what you've been promising yourself? 

03:07:20
TRACY Mm-hmm. 

03:07:20
JEFFREY ZEIG That you would do that. And yet there's been this counter force, and the counter force has been that you've been saying to yourself that somehow, well you can be afraid of success. 

03:07:35
TRACY Yeah, or, right. That would be it. 

03:07:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Okay now, what's the pull, the real magnetic pull to be over there and to... 

03:07:50
TRACY Connection. 

03:07:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

03:07:55
TRACY Connection that isn't patient/client, therapist/client privilege. It's more of an interactive, let's share our lives outside of work type of connection that I don't have right now. 

03:08:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, well, that is a way of re-energizing, and it's a way of renewing and revitalizing. 

03:08:20
TRACY Right now, I'm needing that desperately. 

03:08:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. I remember a woman who came to me for therapy, and she was working as a clinician. She had two foster children. Her husband wanted her to adopt two more difficult foster children. And, etc., etc. She's going to school, doing a whole number of things. And I said that I had this metaphor imagining the cow in a burnt, in a burnt out patch of a beautiful green field. And that this cow had all of these creatures that were attached to her utters. And, she was paralyzed and couldn't move because of all of these creatures, while at the same time it was drying up. And yet all around, was this wonderful field full of this beautiful green grass. and I said to her, "I don't think that you need therapy. I think that you need a holiday." I think that you need a vacation. That you need to something that will really revitalize you. Okay now, you're getting a picture of your life from a different perspective. And, where are you with that right now? 

03:09:50
TRACY It it, it feels good. The closest I've been yet. 

03:09:55
JEFFREY ZEIG With what certainty can you begin to expand those options? What is your feeling of certainty right now that you can meet the dictates of the promise that you made to yourself? 

03:10:05
TRACY I'm the extremely certain. 

03:10:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, you're extremely certain that you can do the social media, do the workshops, do the writing? 

03:10:15
TRACY Yeah. It's creating time. 

03:10:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so what's your certainty that you can find time. 

03:10:25
TRACY Or using time. 

03:10:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Help me to, help me to list. Tell me all of the possible ways that if I were you, that I could get in the way. Okay, so help me. 

03:10:40
TRACY Get in the way of using my time better? 

03:10:40
JEFFREY ZEIG All of the ways that I could use to, as you, if I'm representing you right now, to get in the way of expanding my professional life and achieving some of the things that I promised myself. I can get in the way by fear of success. 

03:11:00
TRACY Taking more patients. 

03:11:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I can get in the way of taking on more patients. I can get in the way by? 

03:11:05
TRACY Uh, not cutting back hours. Seeing people less days of the week. 

03:11:15
JEFFREY ZEIG How can, then well that, that's the way I can accomplish it. I could cut back hours. How, how would I, if I wanted to get in my way, if I wanted to stay. 

03:11:25
TRACY Keep saying yes, even if it's a referral from a client. Don't make any changes to your time. Don't sign up for any classes or workshops that you really want to do. Don't reach out for, for social organizations, networking opportunities. 

03:11:50
JEFFREY ZEIG I can do all of those things. And, then as I'm doing those things, I start to feel. 

03:12:00
TRACY Don't exercise or eat right. 

03:12:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Say that again? 

03:12:00
TRACY Don't exercise or eat right. Right. 

03:12:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And then suddenly I have filled my world. Okay, so now, let's say that your doing some hypnosis with me. I'm a very good hypnotic subject. Right? And what you're going to do, is you're going to hypnotized me into that sense of meeting the dictates of my promise. Right? So, I take a deep breath. I go into a trance. What would you be saying to me? 

03:12:40
TRACY What are you feeling right now and where are you? 

03:12:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Right now I'm present. And right now I'm open and right now I'm attentive and right now I'm sitting back. And right now I'm listening carefully and expectantly. 

03:13:10
TRACY Let's, let's imagine it's a year from now. 

03:13:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

03:13:15
TRACY Where do you want to be and what does it look like? 

03:13:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So, I can see where it is that I want to be. I can get the felt sense of what it is that I want to accomplish, and how I can begin to. 

03:13:35
TRACY Bring the vision alive in all, all your senses. And tell me about it. 

03:13:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Say that again? 

03:13:40
TRACY Bring that vision alive and explain it to me from all your senses. 

03:13:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, I could begin to really interiorize and breathe in that vision. So that I can get the sense of my chest expanding and the breathing slowing down. And, as I look behind my eyes, I can see things a little bit more brightly. And as I listen to my voice, I can hear my voice slowing down and coming from a deeper space in my body. As I begin to really formulate that vision and make that vision something that's more vibrant. And I can see myself stepping into it, and I can feel myself almost magnetically compelled. Now, how would I how can you help me, what would be a first step for me to take? 

03:14:40
TRACY How much of the work that you want to teach, do you know what you want to teach? 

03:14:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Do I know what I want to teach? Yeah. 

03:14:55
TRACY Yeah? You're clear? 

03:15:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I can think of things that would be really valuable to teach. You know, I had a, a such an interesting experience when I was doing that master class in New York. And it was late on a Sunday when we were ending the class. And, so I said to the, to the woman who was complaining about not meeting her promise of writing a book. And she was meeting the promise. And, so she had the book. She had written a proposal. She had really written the book. And I said, "Okay. You know, you know we're going to stop the therapy. You just give me the book. I'll publish it, because I'm a publisher. I have two publishing companies." So, I published the book. So now, here in. 

03:15:45
TRACY I think that was me. 

03:15:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And, no, this is, that would come to you. So, you're going to be presenting a at the brief therapy conference next year in San Francisco, because your proposal has already been accepted, because by the way, I have the authority to accept all of the proposals that come in. 

03:16:00
TRACY Awesome. 

03:16:05
JEFFREY ZEIG So, tell me, what are you presenting? 

03:16:05
TRACY I'm presenting how to achieve your core intelligence. 

03:16:10
JEFFREY ZEIG How to achieve core intelligence. Fabulous topic. 

03:16:15
JEFFREY ZEIG By going inward then outward then upward. 

03:16:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. Okay, so now I'm going to take that into my trance. And I'm going to begin to get into connection with my core intelligence. And I'm going to be thinking about how I connect with my core intelligence so that I can realize more of what it is that I've been promising myself. And, it's that very much upward orientation. Fantastic. Okay. Let's switch for a moment. 

03:17:05
TRACY Okay. 

03:17:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, and how, Tracy, do you best go into trance? 

03:17:10
TRACY I don't know if I've ever been in trance. 

03:17:15
JEFFREY ZEIG What do you imagine that it could be like for you to go into trance? 

03:17:20
TRACY Interesting. 

03:17:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Really interesting. Okay, and one of the ways that you can begin this interesting process is that you can place your hand lightly on your legs. And just allow your, your elbows to come back just a little bit. And that takes any pressure off of your shoulders. And that keeps your neck steady, which will keep your head steady which will keep your ears steady. And it's your ears that I'll really be talking to. And then you can just take it easy breath and close your eyes. And you can allow yourself to, to discover something that, discover something that's really intrigues you. And discover something that really interests you. And I don't know if at the core of your experience will be an interest in the sensations in your body, defining feelings of comfort. And the way in which those feelings of comfort may begin the to move and extend, may intrigue you. And at the core of your experience, perhaps there are images. And there may be colors and shapes and changing patterns that begin to appear effortlessly before your eyes. And you may begin to realize the extent to the way in which those changing patterns begin to move. And perhaps there will be the sense of listening as if at the core of trance, there's a realization that somehow you can listen more carefully to yourself inside. And that there may even be a sense of a flow and a sense of movement to the way in which you hear, to the way in which you listen. And then there may be some changes that you recognize in your body. Somehow it may feel as though you're bit taller. It may seem as if somehow, somehow your feet may seem further away from your head. And you can enjoy the extent of movement, that type of core experience. And all along as you have been listening to me, you may notice that there are changes, changes that begin to happen as your body begins to accommodates the resting state. And there may be a realization of how the rhythm of your breathing has changed. And how the right side of your face relaxes differently. And the way in which the rhythm of the your pulse changes. And all along, you may sense realizations that you're beginning to find interesting, the experience of finding what the core of trance can be for you. And when you think that you've begun to realize something that's valuable and interesting and even profound, and evolving about what trance can be like for you, gently with your eyes closed you can just look up to the top of your head and take an easy breath. Noticing that as you exhale fully, you anchor yourself in the most profound sense of, you anchor yourself in the most profound sense of comfort. Because there are things to realize, things to learn, things to experience that helps you to achieve the balance of comfort that we can define as entrancive. And then I can ask you, Tracy, what are you experiencing right now? 

03:23:30
TRACY Calm. 

03:23:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Calm. And it's a wonderful feeling to really enjoy that calm comfort. And I don't know just how that sense of calm comfort can begin to move. And what's your realization of how that calm comfort moves? 

03:24:00
TRACY Giving me permission to stop moving so fast. 

03:24:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Fantastic. And you have inside permission to slow down, so that you can further, more deeply enjoy the calm comfort. What is it that you find at the core of that calmness? 

03:24:45
TRACY Center. 

03:24:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Really centered. And what do you find in that sense of being centered? 

03:24:55
TRACY Energy. 

03:25:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Energy. 

03:25:00
TRACY Connection. 

03:25:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And real connection. And then see where that connection takes you in all senses. And you may feel the movements inside. You may feel the pulse of your own experience. And where does that connection take you? 

03:25:30
TRACY This time an image of seeing over the planet. 

03:25:35
JEFFREY ZEIG How does that look, seeing over the planet? 

03:25:40
TRACY Expansive. 

03:25:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Energized, expansive. 

03:25:45
TRACY Peaceful. 

03:25:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Peaceful. 

03:25:50
TRACY Energized, but in a good way. 

03:25:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Energized in a really good way. 

03:26:00
TRACY Uh-huh. In a balanced way. 

03:26:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Really balanced. And I would invite you to once again look up to the top of your head, taken easy breath and as you exhale fully, you can memorize that sense, that core sense carefully, because that's a feeling that you may want to, you may want to keep that feeling. And you may give yourself the nod to realize that you can memorize that feeling carefully. So that you can further promise yourself how you can keep that feeling with you and how it can be at work inside you. And, what's happening now? 

03:27:20
TRACY It's coming inward 

03:27:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. And how do you experience it inward? 

03:27:30
TRACY It's like a little light inside my. 

03:27:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. So, take your hand and put your hand on that light, for you first pointed to your abdomen. 

03:27:45
TRACY Yeah, it was in the, here. 

03:27:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, so hold onto that as if you're impressing your abdomen the meaning and the realization of that feeling in such a way that it becomes you. 

03:28:15
[sil.] 

03:28:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And you know your abdomen, that's, that's a place of deserving, because the metaphor for that would be I know when my guts this is what I deserve. And should that have real meaning for you, then just allow yourself to feel the sense of your hand a little bit more vibrantly, luminescentally. And then, Tracy, what's happening now? 

03:29:15
TRACY Mm, just calm and more focused on my hand and the light and the vibrant luminescence in my hand. 

03:29:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic feeling. 

03:29:30
TRACY From inside, yeah. 

03:29:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And this is what I deserve. And the way in which you take it easy breath and just let go can further reinforce the reality of that sensation. And then in this state of calm, this sense of trance, then I'd like you to meditate on what it is that you have been promising yourself. And then I'd like you to take a moment to see yourself in a year, and to imagine where it is that you're going to be. And to think for a moment about the steps that you're going to take, and how you're going to use that intelligence to really get there. And what's happening right now? 

03:31:15
TRACY Connecting with the core and realizing how better getting I was than taking. But, it feels good. 

03:31:30
JEFFREY ZEIG It feels really good. 

03:31:30
TRACY Yeah. 

03:31:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And, what will you do to actualize even a step more how you can listen to the dictates of your heart? 

03:31:45
TRACY What's the question? 

03:31:50
JEFFREY ZEIG How will you now even further impress upon yourself that sense of attending to the dictates of your heart so that you can feel it in your abdomen? 

03:32:10
TRACY How will I do it action wise? Or from all parts of the self? 

03:32:15
JEFFREY ZEIG In all senses. 

03:32:25
[sil.] 

03:32:25
TRACY I don't know. I think in terms of movements and persistence and consciousness. 

03:32:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Movement and persistence and consciousness, core consciousness, core movements. Core persistence. And then project yourself a year from now. And where is it that you see yourself? 

03:33:00
TRACY Somewhere on the West Coast. On the stage getting people involved and energized and discovering their own unique core intelligence. 

03:33:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. And then feel your hand or sense your hand and feel the resonance of your hand as this is something that you deserve. Got it? 

03:33:40
TRACY Mm-hmm. 

03:33:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Really got it. Okay, then I'd like you to bring yourself back and reorient and bring yourself back here. And you can reorient yourself by taking one or two or three easy breath. Just take one or two or three easy breath, and begin to bring yourself back, fully alert and wide-awake and refreshed and energetic and really oriented all over. 

03:34:15
[sil.] 

03:34:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Hi. 

03:34:20
TRACY Hi. 

03:34:25
JEFFREY ZEIG You surprised yourself for a moment when you came out of trance. 

03:34:25
TRACY Yeah. I was like. 

03:34:30
JEFFREY ZEIG What surprised you? 

03:34:30
TRACY How deep I was in it. 

03:34:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, help me to understand. 

03:34:35
TRACY It was very relaxing and very centered. The word centered keeps coming to mind. 

03:34:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Centered. And your eyes and. 

03:34:40
TRACY Just a wetness. 

03:34:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Good feeling? 

03:34:45
TRACY Yeah. Relaxing. 

03:34:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, yeah, okay, so now, what's your certainty that you can take this and do this? 

03:34:55
TRACY Positive. 

03:35:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Really positive. Yeah. So, if you were going to scale that, and you were going to say, you know, when I started the session today my certainty was here. And this would be a hundred percent certainty here, right? So, where would you put yourself now if this is where you were when you began? Fantastic. Got it. Okay. Are there questions that you have of me, because I'd like to bring things to a close if you're here, a hundred percent good with where we've traveled. Any questions that you have of me? 

03:35:40
TRACY Not right now. 

03:35:45
JEFFREY ZEIG No? Okay, but I will be glad to refer you to the syllabus to remember when the proposals are due for the conference with the assurance that your proposal has already been accepted. 

03:36:00
TRACY Awesome. 

03:36:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Awesome. 

03:36:05
[sil.] 

03:36:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so let's unhook you, but a good way to do that is to turn off the microphone first. And then we'll bring Michael up on stage. And then again, thank, thank Tracy. 

03:36:30
[sil.] 

03:36:30
JEFFREY ZEIG I see that Michael has here a couple of his videos from some of his demonstrations, and this really remarkable series of demonstrations that Michael annotates and indicates some of the things that he's been doing. So, we have some of these available through the, people volunteer, but we have them also available for, oh, volunteers. Congratulations. Okay, coach. Let's go. Okay. 

03:37:10
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm back on? 

03:37:15
JEFFREY ZEIG So, what, what I meant about trying to make things visually come alive and using visual metaphors as well as the, as a verbal metaphors and, and creates spaces that, okay, well I can give the person like suddenly Michael White speaks through me for a minute. And I'm thinking about externalizing the problem, but I'm not just thinking about externalizing the problem as saying Mr. Alcohol is attacking this family. What can the family due to confront Mr. Alcohol? But, actually creating a living metaphor for externalizing the problem and then creating. It's kind of a little bit like a computer virus. And so if you can create a visual image, it's just a little bit garish. And you want it to be a kind of computer virus. You don't want to make fun of the patient, but there's nothing wrong with being a little bit ironic with the problem. And so then, the person can get an externalized picture, and that externalized picture is hard to escape from. It easier to escape from words than it is to escape from images. And then to create an image of what the goal is, so that the person can begin to interiorize that and be able to see what it is that they want in a representational form. And, the symbolic nature of human beings is just so great that we respond avidly to gestures. And this is part of our sociobiology. And, reptiles respond to gestures. This, you know, in the deepest part of our brain as social animals we need to respond to gestures. And birds, they respond to gestures. And, mammals, dogs for example, they respond to gestures. And this is so deeply embedded in our core. And if we said that the problem solely existed in our medial prefrontal cortex, we would just be able to think our way out of problems. We would need to psychotherapists. So, when we think the problems probably exist in the lower regions of the brain, then perhaps it's wise to use some techniques that reach into the lower areas of our brain like for example gestural language and try to use that gestural language to empower people to do the things that they promised themselves. So, hence the idea of doing the sculpting and making the stage into a little bit of a, making the therapy room into a little bit of the stage in which we can enact a symbolic drama change. Interesting. What light can you shed on this? How can you illuminate it? 

03:40:10
MICHAEL YAPKO As a, as a smarter than average reptile, I respond to all your gestures very well. Uh, you will recall as I do a lovable curmudgeon by the name of Steve de Shazer, and Steve once said to me, "Man, you just work too hard." And, my response was, "I'm not really worried about it." And, you obviously aren't either. I think one of the first things that always impresses me when I watch you is how earnest you are about wanting something good to happen. And you think about how powerful that message alone is, to be able to say to somebody in essence, I'm invested in you. I want you to do what you came here to do. I care about you. And I'm going to use everything I've got to help you do that. And, you know, you're all over the place with coming from so many different angles. And, I can't help but think how valuable that is in somebody feeling cared about, somebody doing that they've got your attention. And, I just, I just like that a lot, the fact that there is that attitude long before you ever open your mouth or start waving your arms. You've got that attitude going. Uh, you know, the opening statement for me is always, as people who have trained with me know, the opening statement before there is any contaminants of asking questions always is to me so revealing. And her first statement is the most global of all statements. I want to change my life. But then, you know, you gave her a nonverbal look that said, "Okay, you're going to have to do a little bit better than that." And very quickly, she came to talking about the structure of my practice. And, you know, this is about how people make choices. You know, all of us, if, if you are incredibly well organized, there are 24 hours in the day. If you are incredibly disorganized, there are 24 hours in a day. Time is a finite commodity, and what defines you and defines your quality of life is how you use that time. And so, to me a very logical question to ask is, how do you choose what to do? What's the basis for the choices that you make. And these are choices she's making. And, you, you didn't ask that, and in your own way you still got the salient piece of information. She's talking about the fear. And the fear that goes into making this, this kind of big change. And then when you... 

03:43:10
JEFFREY ZEIG That's the story she tells herself. 

03:43:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. And, you know, you were very gracious in accepting it and then dismantling it, which is, you know, that is exactly what needed to be done. Just from a technical point of view, I thought it was a really nice pattern interruption, that as soon as she said I don't have a personal life, you know, you didn't say, "Oh, you poor dear. Oh, are you working that hard?" Immediately, abruptly, turn to everybody, totally interrupted that whole, you know, I'm a victim of my own choices type thing, and made it really clear that as you went into your lecture on gallows humor. So, I thought it was a great use of indirection in turning to the audience at that point and, and talking a little bit about that. And of course, indirectly encouraging her to think that maybe this has more emotional power to what's happening here than. 

03:44:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Let me react to one point, because, just because I'm old and getting a little tired, and didn't want to forget about it. Just as a teaching point. 

03:44:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Your microphone's not on. 

03:44:25
JEFFREY ZEIG What? 

03:44:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Your microphone's not on. 

03:44:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Not? Am I on? Yes? yes? 

03:44:30
MICHAEL YAPKO There you go. 

03:44:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Okay, so if you, you know, are working with somebody and they are stopping smoking, and I say to that person, "Can you tell me ten logical excuses, five logical excuses for having one puff of one cigarette?" And you get them to ventilate those excuses in public, the excuses that we have in our mind, the stories that we tell ourselves, "I'm afraid of success." Or however you would, would frame it, that we have a lot of excuses, stories that we tell ourselves in our mind. So, if we get the person to ventilate those things, especially in a public forum, you hope that they can realize that those excuses have much less power to them, and that they don't have to be mesmerized by those things inside. Once they get them out, and they, they you know, can begin to list them publicly, they lose some of their power, just by virtue of ventilating them. 

03:45:40
MICHAEL YAPKO It's one of the, one of the things that I commented on. You, you went through this period of doing this sculpting, and to me, I have no way of knowing if this was your intent of course, but the thing that really struck me about it was how it ended up shifting the sequence that needed to be shifted, because what she's been doing is waiting until it feels right in order to do it. And I think, you are giving her that message, no, you do it in order to make it feel right. It's a, it's a let's change the sequence of that. And then when you kind of reinforced that by giving her the task right there, then and there, list all possible ways to get in the way of expanding your life. Very different kind of question. Not, how do you, how do you change, but how do you stay the same? And that is, is a really nice shift of focus and, and then you did the role reversal, which was also really nice. Of adopting her problem as if the problem is now you, and what she going to say to you? And the next thing she knows, she's doing hypnosis with you about what she's going to say and how she's going to approach it, which was really nice. And then what was interesting in the middle of that, all of a sudden you popped out, leaned forward and you are right in her face. And I, she was taken aback for a moment, but it kept her engaged in a whole, whole different way. And so, it was a very nice exchange at that point about the resources to tap into and then offering yourself as publisher, and offering yourself as decider. That was, that was good. 

03:47:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so we, we, just one second. Three, because I just want to, rather than reflecting after if it doesn't interrupt your process, just, just to reinforce that for teaching purposes. Three kinds of faith, and that in order to proceed as a therapist, I immersed myself, hypnotize myself if you will, in three types of faith. And one faith that if I have this problem, I could solve it. And I need to know that if I had this problem I could solve it. So, to do the role reversal and put myself physically, well that's one part. But, mentally I need to know that I can solve it. Faith number two, is that this person has in their history a resource for solving the problem. And faith number three, is that I can utilize whatever the person brings to help them to access that resource. So, once I can ground myself in the three types of faith, then I know that I can proceed. And this way, doing it as a role reversal just helps to reinforce that inside me. 

03:48:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Exactly. That's good. And then you transition into the formal hypnotic part of the experience. Real good utilization of her language. And you were right into intrigue and the core of her experience, a term that you used throughout. You used her language about changing patterns. And. 

03:48:40
JEFFREY ZEIG That was a little goofy, if I would, you know, criticize myself. And probably in my own session, I would be much more subtle. And for the teaching purposes, I was just trying to be more blatant and more overt about the use of her language. And the idea of taking symptom words and turning them into solution words or taking symptom words and taking them into hypnosis words. And this is a core utilization of strategy. If you do that so quickly as I am, as I was doing it here, it's just a little goofy. But, if you do that with a delay, I think it has much more power. So, if you're asking the patient, "Well, tell me about your physical pain." And the person says, "Well, it's like burning." And then in the next session you start finding ways of taking symptom description and turning that into a hypnosis description, like there can be a burning desire to experience more comfort. And suddenly, your re-framing the word, but not so proximate. Then, I think it has more power. 

03:49:50
MICHAEL YAPKO I didn't think it was goofy at all. I thought, I thought it worked. You made use of a lot of process suggestions about how these changes happen and encouraging lots of projections on her part about how she could do all that. And then, as you checked in with her, and again, this is obviously something you do a lot. I really like it a lot. How important that check-in is to be able to get feedback and then feed it right back and get it and feed it back. So, all of that was really good, the, the association to her hand on her stomach was, you know, the anchor was, you know, I deserve this. And, you know, changing the feeling about what feeling, which feeling she's going to use is the basis for making the change. And I, I can talk at, there are a million details to it, but at the end point when you check back in with her about what her level of certainty was now, it was obviously very very high. And, you know, she was, she was playful with it. I think she got a lot out of it. So, nicely done. 

03:51:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Thanks. 

03:51:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Nicely done. 

03:51:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So, scaling. Right, scaling is, you know, part of therapy, not just part of solution focused therapy. But, scaling, why not making the scale the visual. Here's where you were when you started. Here's where you want to be. Where are you now? Well, you're saying, ten point scale, but instead of saying it of the scale, let's make it come alive and be more visual, more multisensory and create the same scale, but I think you can there enrich the meaning. And, that's the essence of thinking about this experiential approach. 

03:51:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Could you have done any of that if you weren't wearing Albert Einstein socks? 

03:51:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Probably not. It's something that infuses that spirit into my soul. Yeah, I was. 

03:52:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Do I set him up for great lines? 

03:52:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I was teaching for the Einstein group in Cape Cod, and stumbled upon those socks. And one of my affectations is having the world's great collection of socks. So, please what, what thoughts questions? 

03:52:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Questions and observations? 

03:52:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, Gary? 

03:52:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Please, please. 

03:52:40
[sil.] 

03:52:40
UNKNOWN It was very wonderful, Jeff. Michael, how would you approach the same situation? 

03:52:55
MICHAEL YAPKO My very first question after she said that, you know she's working too much, my first question would have up been, "How do you decide what to do?" And, I think that what it would have elicited is that she has and unusually rigid decision-making strategy for how she distributes her time. And I would have in hypnosis started suggesting a series of alternative ways of making decisions about how you use your time. So, you can, in her case, you know, she, she chooses according to fear and according to some sense of professional responsibility that she needs to see all these people. And it's an honor to be part of their lives, but that's what she's doing. And I think I, instead of talking about the balance as a framework, I would have talked about how do you, you can make decisions in a lot of different ways. Do you make decisions according to your feelings? Do make decisions according to precedent? Do you make decisions according to what's going to make mom happy or what's going to make dad happy or what's going to make your client happy? Or do you choose according to what your financial planner tells you to do? Do you choose according to what? But in this particular case, to me the most compelling thing is how do you choose according to the outcome you want and not according to how it feels? And, and I've got a lifetime of that, because depressed people in particular, I'm not suggesting Tracy is depressed, but I'm saying it's a pattern I'm familiar with because what depressed people do routinely is they make choices according to their mood states. Which means they end up making bad choices, which end up reinforcing the depression. In fact, this is not just a personal observation, there's a relatively new model called the "stress generation model of depression" which has very quickly obtained a great deal of empirical support, and focuses on people's decision making strategies and how they make decisions that make their lives worse rather than better. So, the whole idea of introducing flexibility in a variety of ways of how you choose, I think would've been the direction I personally would've gone. 

03:55:15
JEFFREY ZEIG I would say to reinforce that that out of the couple hundred hours that I spent with Milton Erickson, I would say that at least a quarter of them were spent with flexibility stories, and that this was such an inherent feeling and it was as if Dr. Erickson had categorized a little library in his mind. And so, he would tell flexibility stories about children. And then there would be a just a whole series of flexibility stories about children. And then he would have flexibility stories about adolescents. And then we would have flexibility stories about adults. And then he would have flexibility stories about culture. And then he'd have flexibility stories about animals. And depending upon your developmental level, he, he would start to spin these stories. And they would just float into your mind, one story after another story after another story until suddenly you get it, and it's the recursion of those stories that would get you there. Now, curiously when I went to visit Erickson it was at the end of my rebellious stage. I was working counterculture. And I was working for Joan Baez in the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence, organizing against the Vietnam War. I showed up at Dr. Erickson's house wearing a work shirt that I never tucked in, jeans, because I only had three work shirts and a couple pairs of jeans and sandals. And that's, that's how I showed up in 1973, because I was at the end of my counterculture days. And so he started with me telling me stories about ridiculous rigidities. And I would start laughing, "Ho, ho, ho. I don't have that ridiculous rigidity." not so consciously but, "Ho, ho, ho. I don't have that ridiculous rigidity." And it was as if gradually I was matching against the framework that he was presenting. And I'm sure that in, I have no idea who I'd be if it wasn't for that time with, with Dr. Erickson, but, but certainly you can reverse it. It's not just orienting the person to flexibility. You could also orient the person to ridiculous rigidities in a kind of paradoxical way. And there was something else that I wanted to mention. It was using gestures while the person is in trance. And so that even though the person has their eyes closed, I am gesturing. Now, if you call the Erickson Foundation and Melinda answers the telephone, and you hear Erickson Foundation compared to Erickson Foundation, you know that there is a difference. You may not feel that in a conscious way, but it's there. And, it's a strange kind of rigidity on the part of psychotherapists that psychotherapists don't use their body when they're doing trance. And they don't use their body to emphasize suggestions. Now, to me because Tracy's responsiveness was so important that before I moved in a more therapeutic direction, I wanted to know that she was responding to some of the tone and the tempo and the gestures that I was making, even though she had her eyes closed. And so, when I start talking like this, and then she comes up with the concept of balance, and she says the word, right, that's the moment in which I think that hypnosis exists. When the person starts responding to the implication that inherited the message. And when you watch videos of Dr. Erickson, this is what you see. He was a response generating machine, developing a responsiveness to the tone, to the tempo, to the direction of his voice and the meaning of the words. And in life, you can't have enough love and in hypnosis you can't have enough responsiveness. And then the research on social psychology now demonstrates how our unconscious mind is oriented to responding in ways that we're not consciously aware of. And that we think that's so much is done with intentionality, but the whole field of social psychology demonstrates that we are responding to demand characteristics and attributions and priming and expectancies and all kinds of things without realizing it. And hypnosis, I think Erickson was the quintessential social psychologist before the field of social psychology was defined. And he was, uh, examining curiously how do people respond to nuance. And, this is what I watched when I saw him work, how we established that relationship, and how, how, how after less he was at really wanting to, to work with the person. If you, if you were willing to come 50 percent of the way, he was willing to come 51 percent of the way. I can remember a case where I was seeing an ex-patient of Dr. Erickson's, and Dr. Erickson retired. Dr. Erickson was still alive. And, this was a, from a very wealthy family. And if I mentioned the enterprise, you would all know it, because it's one of those global kinds of enterprises. And, this was the wife. And she was going through a period of alcoholism. And, so Erickson said Robert was very good at finding things, his son. And they, Robert was casing her home, because he didn't want her hospitalized. Robert was casing your home so that when he was sure that she wasn't hiding any alcohol. And then as I remember, Roxie and Christie were babysitting the patient as she moved into her recovery phase, because Dr. Erickson didn't want them, didn't want her hospitalized. And so this was the kind of approach of Ericksonian family therapy. Erickson family did therapy with the patient. And you were involved in, in, and it was really a family situation. I remember we. Let's go to other questions before I get caught up in my reminiscences. 

04:01:40
UNKNOWN First, I, I just want to thank both of you. This entire conference has been exhilarating. This caps it all off, having this master class today and seeing this level of commentary and intimacy around our profession. You know, I, I think there are so many ways to show up in the world, and I, I like Michael that you emphasized choice of how we can do our work. I, I just like the, the way we're slicing some things today. There's a lot of depth to the commentary. An observation not particularly about Tracy. I certainly celebrate her choices and what she's going to go on and do, and totally confident that she will do it. But, I, I don't know how many psychologists are helping people in the room have been helpers who are burned out. And, are changing and what a disservice that does to us when we have clients. When I'm sitting in front of a psychologist, and she hasn't changed her three years, and keeps moaning about her workload. And I am, I am out here having fun and traveling the world. Come on, make some changes. You know, it's a disservice in a way that,uh, that we are choosing burnout, some of us. 

04:02:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Burnout is an existential problem in my estimation. And so, Ayala Pines is probably one of the people who coined the concept. She's an Israeli psychologist, and there was a kind of social psychology mafia, like Aronson(ph) and Maslich(ph) and Zimbardo, and Hines(ph). And they did a lot of work on burnout and couples burnout. So, Ayala Pines did a study, and she asked nurses, 'Why did you become a nurse?" And they said, "Well, to help people." Well, that wasn't very scientifically interesting. And she asked teachers, "Why did you become a teacher?" "To inspire people." And that was a very interesting. And businessmen, "Why did you become a businessman?" "To be the best." Well, those are pretty obvious. You don't need to do a survey to find that out. So, then she asked what was the most formative thing in your upbringing. And, as it turned out statistically nurses grew up in much more chaotic situations. And teachers grew up in situations where they were embarrassed, ashamed, like they were too tall or too thin or too many pimples or their, their trauma was more being embarrassed. And businessmen grew up in a situation where the trauma was about not being the best. And so that their occupation was a choice for healing, just like marriage is a crucible for healing. Your occupation was a choice for healing. So, then because her expertise is in burnout, she started to understand why do people burn out. Well, the teachers burned out because they couldn't inspire. Either they didn't have the skill set or the administration was such that it got in the way. And the nurses who chose a very structured environment, in contradistinction to the chaotic environment that they grew up then, burned out when they couldn't help, because the administration or because they didn't have the skill set. And businessmen burned out when they couldn't be the best. So, I know that I'll never burnout doing therapy because it meets all of my existential goals. And so then, burnout is not, because I know that I'm meeting my existential goals, I don't burn out. It won't even occur to me. The concept doesn't even occur to me because, because it's, I consider it, I'm doing what I was designed to do. And, it meets all of my existential needs. 

04:05:20
UNKNOWN Yes, Jeff. And you do that with such integrity, and I'm curious about one part of your demo today, and that's when you had, you embodied for Tracy some of her descriptions. So, I'm curious. Typically, when I've done that myself with, with people I coach, you know, I have them embody it as the first step. And I want to learn more from you about how you choose to model that first and your story about that. 

04:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, the sculpting started in the 1970s, and Peggy Papp, Bunny Dool(ph) and Virginia Satir were doing family sculpting. And then that technique sort of fell out of favor, and so then the idea of sculpting. I've been doing this for at least the last ten, twelve years, where giving the person an opportunity to visually encounter the externalization of their resource state or desired state or the externalization of their problem state allows me to project into that, and to talk about it and discuss it and describe it and begin to perhaps dissemble it and contaminated in a little way. But, I think it's important that people get visual reference, that my tendency is, you know, it would be more unusual to do what I did with Tracy, where she enacted at. It was fabulous when she enacted it, because she would energize it and experience it much more vividly than I could express it. But, I, you know, you, you begin to see. When Lillian, my wife, and I are doing this and we're lying on the floor or we're crawling or we're doing all kinds of things where the subtle intention is what Michael was saying. Whatever you need that's going to help you will do. Right, so one other Erickson story that reinforces that. So, one of the friends of the Erickson family was referred as a patient, and the patient has a fear of getting lost. And this is a family friend, a patient was a family friend. And he referred somebody else, and the man sees Dr. Erickson and that's great. And they have a good session. And suddenly, Sunday morning at eight o'clock, there's a knock on the patient's door. He comes to the door. It's Dr. Erickson. What is my psychiatrist doing at my door on a Sunday? And then Dr. Erickson says, "Well, let's go for a drive." Well, this is compelling. So then they go for drive. And Dr. Erickson says, "Let's go here." And they go here. And they do a task. And let's go there. And they mix the first task with a second task. And let's go here. And they do third task. And they're driving around, and suddenly they're lost. And the patient lives through his fear. Now, the sense of that, you know, that this, I'll do anything. And if you're honest and you really want to get there, I'll do whatever it takes to help you. That was an amazing facet of who Erickson was. And I'm sure that it profuses my spirit. Please. 

04:08:30
UNKNOWN I just wanted to make a quick comment, Jeff, that your keynote was on Beethoven, and I saw Beethoven there. It was quite something. 

04:08:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, thank you so much. 

04:08:45
UNKNOWN It would be really interesting to try and actually put that to music. 

04:08:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you so much. 

04:08:45
UNKNOWN I'm not sure if you did this on purpose or if you're even aware of it. 

04:08:55
JEFFREY ZEIG I did. 

04:08:55
UNKNOWN I would love to see the tape over again because there, when Tracy was sitting there and you said at one point, "I'm now going to shift. And I'm you and your me." And in that moment, Tracy had her legs under her, and she extended them out, way, way into your area. And then, as you are talking non-verbally, you embraced her legs with your legs. And then later on, you asked her how, how, what's she going to be doing? And she said, "Well, I'm going to be with someone." And to me, it just seems like if I, if I were doing that, somehow I would have asked about the someone else or let her talk about that, because it seemed non-verbally that that was a big thing that she was talking about. 

04:10:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, but not in public in a demonstration form like this. 

04:10:05
UNKNOWN You didn't. I, I mean. I even thought about should I should I mentioned that? 

04:10:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, yes. On a, on a subterranean level, you can have a whole other conversation. But, but the, it's like this attunement, social mimicry. And that you are, you know you have your head in a relatively straight posture. And when I'm talking to you I have my head in a relatively straight posture. And then, you start to tilt your head to your right, and I'm tilting my head to the left so that I'm parallel to you. Now, this is not mirroring. It's called social mimicry. And there are hundreds of papers on social mimicry and that if you do this with a one second delay, the attunement effect is profound. And the building of responsiveness, and the feeling of friendliness that you have when somebody actually does social mimicry. And all you need to do is to put into Google "social mimicry", and you find papers by von Barron (ph) and by Tanya Chartrand at Duke. And these are preeminent, these are eminent social psychologists. And they are studying it without taking it from theory and understanding of how social animals work into practice. And we should be taking this and going not just to Beethoven but to social psychology and taking concepts from social psychology and bring them into practice. So, I'm patently aware of the mirroring that I'm doing, but not as mirroring but as social mimicry. I don't want my patients to feel self-conscious, so I tend to do that with a one second delay, and I try to be as intentional as I possibly can about my nonverbal behavior. And I want that Beethoven effect, the precision of focusing as much power as we possibly can to really help this person. 

04:11:55
UNKNOWN So you're really saying it, the timing that you're aware of all that, and you make it not blessable(ph). 

04:12:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. But it's like, it's like flying a plane. I'm a glider pilot, so I know, you know. I play bridge four hours a week. I'm playing the tin whistle. I exercise every day. I try to put balance to effect in my life. And, so I, you know, know that in the past I have been over involved with work and not have had balance. And I know that I've made that correction, the choice, and I put more balance into my life. And, so that helps me to be much more congruent when I'm talking with Stacy. But, being a glider pilot, you, you learn when you're flying a plane there are five undesirable side effects of banking a plane. Now, you know, think about turning the car. You just turn the car. But, when you bank a plane, you have diving tendency. So, you have to pull the nose up a little bit as you bank. Well, you have adverse yaw, so you have to use a little top rudder as you're banking the plane. Well, you also have, you know, turning tendency. You have to use a little reverse aileron as you're making the bank. It's a very complex thing to do, to bank a plane. Now, when I started glider flying 30 years ago, I had to think about every one of those components. And now, I just bank the plane. And now I fly aerobatics, and I'm trying to learn how to do a hammerhead stall in a 15 meter wingspan glider. And you know, enjoying the heck out of it. And I don't think about how the bank the plane. I don't even think about attunement anymore. So, I just incorporated that, and it's become unconscious in my repertoire. And then I just do attunement. And then I can think of other things about what I can do, and I think about how to sequence things and how to present ideas and how to, you know, word the suggestions and how to use little moments of destabilization so that as quickly as possible, I want to make those things unconscious so I don't have to think about them. And I can add more layers of complexity, and that tickles me. That just intrigues the heck out of me that I can add more layers of complexity into my communication. 

04:14:20
UNKNOWN Well done. Thank you very much. 

04:14:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And, and he's, he's great at using that as enticement too. He invited me to go glider sailing with him. And his enticement was some of the most famous therapists who ever lived have thrown up in my plane. 

04:14:35
JEFFREY ZEIG I said actually some of the famous, most famous hypnotists who have ever lived, because that included my mother. Yeah. One more, and then we need to stop. I didn't realize we were, we're pushing the time limit. 

04:14:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, just a quickly. Clearly, before the sensation that she was overloaded with patients, she applied to give the presentation. So, it seems that there was already some strategies in place for breaking out of her being stuck, but you didn't spend a lot of time utilizing that in terms of her successful strategy of breaking out. Why didn't you explore that a little further? 

04:15:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. Because it was, it seemed to fait accomplis. There didn't seem to be any reason to, you know, it's like the quickest way to disassemble something is to over examine it. If you over examine something then, you know, sometimes that's a useful strategy, but sometimes you get in the way by over examining it. And if it's just fait accomplis, then just, you know, move onto the next thing. There's no reason to spend time examining it. 

04:15:45
UNKNOWN Except that she, she actually made the decision, I'm going to do something that's not patient care. 

04:15:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

04:15:50
UNKNOWN And that was, you know, what's next? 

04:15:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, great. 

04:15:50
UNKNOWN Anyway. Thank you. 

04:15:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, let's take a ten minute break, shall we?

MICHAEL YAPKO Are you doing the day? 

04:16:30
AUDIENCE Yeah. 

04:16:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Good. Good. This is Jeff's brainchild, so he gets all the credit. That's why he gets the cool socks. All right, so the name has been drawn. And the name is Mike Rhodes(ph). Is Mike Rhodes here? Nothing like volunteering then leaving. Well, if he was here what I would tell him is. Do you want to wait one more minute and give him a chance? 

04:17:35
[sil.] 

04:17:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Sometimes the line can be really long in the bathroom. 

04:17:45
[sil.] 

04:17:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Sorry? Okay. 

04:18:00
[sil.] 

04:18:00
MIKE RHODES I guess I'm not going to win the lottery this week. 

04:18:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi, Mike. As you can tell already, he's got his own rhythm. 

04:18:20
[sil.] 

04:18:20
MICHAEL YAPKO No, not quite. 

04:18:45
[sil.] 

04:18:45
MICHAEL YAPKO There you go. 

04:18:50
MIKE RHODES I apologize you're having to wait for me. 

04:18:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Turn that on. 

04:18:55
MIKE RHODES I apologize y'all had to wait for me. 

04:19:00
MICHAEL YAPKO It just puts undue pressure on you to be worth waiting for. 

04:19:10
[sil.] 

04:19:10
MICHAEL YAPKO And the way you wrote this, apparently you prefer Mike to Michael? 

04:19:20
MIKE RHODES Yeah, Mike is great. 

04:19:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Mike is great. What would you like help with, Mike? 

04:19:25
MIKE RHODES Uh. 

04:19:25
MICHAEL YAPKO I don't do that. 

04:19:30
MIKE RHODES I would love motivation to exercise. I've had it in the past. And, the first time I exercised with any consistency or any real effort was at the age of nevermind. I was 40. And, I had great results over the three months working with a trainer and everything, and lately, well the last five years, 2005, uh, entered the Masters program for a family therapy degree, and then I went insane and decided to do the PhD. So now I'm working on the dissertation. And, in the course of those two years of program, this internship, licensed and working full time, and president of the local chapter of AMFT, and I'm exhausted. Along the way, thought I was depressed. It turned out it was my thyroid and testosterone stuff, so I'm taking medication for that. And, still just can't get any consistency. I would love that energy and motivation, which when I used hypnosis the first time, it was totally accidental where I did some self hypnosis that my normal habit then, sort of like now, would be get home from work, take a nap. But, the self hypnosis would generate that energy that I've got to do something. And I'd put my sneakers on, and once I got in the car to go to the gym, I was fine. So, I'd love to recapture that. 

04:21:15
MICHAEL YAPKO So, you're saying you to get home, you'd still have a lot of energy and that's what would occur to you to do was to use that energy? 

04:21:25
MIKE RHODES No, I'd actually I'd lay down to take a nap, and in those first four or five minutes maybe, the hypnosis would kick in and would generate that not quite anxiety or nervous energy, but something that I'd be unsettled until I put my sneakers on and changed to head out the door. 

04:21:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And was that a pretty consistent response? 

04:21:55
MIKE RHODES Up until I got used to the workout and began to anticipate it and then look forward to it and understood what working out and being sore was all about. On those days when I would be tempted to fall into the old habit of, "Oh, I don't feel like going." It would work to get me going again. A little self hypnosis would help me to stay on track. Eating healthier, doing all sorts of good stuff. Being active in a lot of different ways. You know, getting on my bike or rollerblades or whatever. 

04:22:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. How do you know how much activity you need or is optimal for you? 

04:22:35
MIKE RHODES A little bit of something is better than a whole lot of nothing, you know. Anything is an improvement at this point. 

04:22:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Are you working out at all? 

04:22:45
MIKE RHODES No. I'm paying for that danged Bally's every month, and you know, 15 bucks a month for nothing. But, you know, just to work up a sweat and get out of breath for 30 minutes would be great. 

04:22:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And do you have an idea in terms of your own energy level, the distribution of your energy during the day, when it would be optimal for you to work out? 

04:23:10
MIKE RHODES Uh, sometimes I could do it in the morning. Sometimes in the evening after work. I do like that flexibility. You know, the first time I did self hypnosis I said I'm going to get up at six in the morning. Well, I got up at six in the morning for the next six weeks until I realized, wait, I can sleep in on the weekends. So, I want to have that flexibility that the best opportunity, whatever today provides, I can get it done. If it's my only chance in the morning, I'm going to do it in the morning. Or, if I have stuff to do in the morning I can do it in the evening, but I'm going to do something. 

04:23:45
MICHAEL YAPKO So, let's say you decide you're going to do in the morning, tomorrow morning. You wake up. You don't really feel like doing it. Then what? 

04:24:00
MIKE RHODES There has been in the past that internal something that generated the focus and energy to overcome the usual negativity, pessimism or just I don't feel like it. By the way, I'm staying in the hotel. I can workout tonight. 

04:24:30
MICHAEL YAPKO You're saying there wasn't energy to do that. 

04:24:30
MIKE RHODES Yeah, that, again that unsettledness that, uh, moved me beyond the negativity or the let's just do the same old thing. You are too tired. Because, once I get through that, those messages or whatever, once I get into it, I find that energy and I am excited and energized. And as I'm exhausted through the day and stuff like that, at the end of a long day, I know that if I worked out and was eating healthier, I'd have all the energy I needed. 

04:25:10
MICHAEL YAPKO You've been to the gym before. When you've gone to the gym, have you seen people there who are regulars? 

04:25:15
MIKE RHODES Sure. 

04:25:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Have you ever talked to them? 

04:25:20
MIKE RHODES Some. 

04:25:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Have you ever asked them how they became regulars? 

04:25:25
MIKE RHODES They have workout partners. They build it into their routine. 

04:25:35
MICHAEL YAPKO You've asked them that or you know that? 

04:25:40
MIKE RHODES We talked about it. 

04:25:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, and how many different strategies have you learned from them about what it takes to be fairly consistent? 

04:26:00
[sil.] 

04:26:00
MIKE RHODES Most have a partner, somebody they meet there or as for a strategy, they go the same time every day. They get up early. And get to the gym. Or, they go a specific time every day consistently. 

04:26:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Are they asking for flexibility in their schedule? 

04:26:35
MIKE RHODES Not so much. They have the kind of schedule where they can do the same thing at the same time every day. 

04:26:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You wake up every morning. 

04:26:45
MIKE RHODES I do, I do. I could do that. I'd even be willing to do that. I'd love to do that. 

04:26:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Don't say it if you don't mean it. 

04:26:55
MIKE RHODES It used to be so miserable for me to get out of bed in the morning. And again, going back to when I first started with hypnosis, uh, I started getting up early. And at 6:00, 5:30 in the morning. And I've even been to the gym at six in the morning once in a while. And I am amazed at those people that are already finished and walking out by the time I get there at six. But, I also have that memory experience of being up at six and those early hours, and then the sort of resenting the birds chirping and the activity in the street. Like, oh, this is my time. Quit interfering. You know, it's quiet and beautiful and I'm getting a lot done. So, yeah, I could mean that. 

04:27:45
MICHAEL YAPKO And somehow this is an either/or things that you're either working out or you're getting things done? 

04:27:55
MIKE RHODES No, because I actually, I'd get up early to get things done. And it was, at that time where I was working with a trainer after work, like 3:30, 4:00. 

04:28:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And? 

04:28:10
MIKE RHODES Well then he closed up shop. I think I sort of lost that impetus, never quite got into a routine of my own and made it my own. 

04:28:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And if you had done that, what would that have been like? How would you have done that? 

04:28:30
MIKE RHODES I wouldn't look like the snake that swallow the rabbit, you know. I would have maintained that and, that consistency and I wouldn't be at an all-time high with my weight. 

04:28:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you get the questions I'm asking, don't you? I'm really asking how these people who are relatively consistent, and nobody is 100 percent consistent. You can walk into the gym with the people who are the most amazing and, you know, they still need a little too much of Thanksgiving. They're still a little lazy about, you know, they blew off the run yesterday. And, okay, that happens. But, for the majority of those people who do that well, what frame are they in? How do they do that? 

04:29:30
MIKE RHODES First and foremost is probably the mind set. 

04:29:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Which is what? 

04:29:35
MIKE RHODES That they're going to do it. 

04:29:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Do they ask themselves? 

04:29:40
MIKE RHODES No, a more like tell themselves. 

04:29:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Do they contemplate? Do they introspect whether they feel like it right now? 

04:29:50
MIKE RHODES I would imagine they probably just have discovered that way to just do it. 

04:29:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Do they explore their feelings about putting on running shoes? 

04:30:00
MIKE RHODES Well, that's just mean. No, they've discovered that way to just do it out of habit. 

04:30:10
MICHAEL YAPKO So, in terms of the ability then two separate what you do from how you feel, that's the skill that they've mastered. 

04:30:25
MIKE RHODES Yeah. 

04:30:25
MICHAEL YAPKO True? 

04:30:25
MIKE RHODES Yeah. 

04:30:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Can you see it? 

04:30:30
MIKE RHODES Yeah. 

04:30:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And that's, that's one of the dangers of thinking too much. It's one of the dangers of ruminating and, and second-guessing and exploring and not waking up and saying do I feel like it. It's just part of what they do. They go do it. And, it seems to me that that would be a really valuable thing in this session, to be able to work yourself towards that frame where this now falls outside the realm of contemplation, like so many of the other things you do. I, I would be willing to wager this morning you didn't wake up and contemplate whether you felt like shaving. How do I feel about getting dressed? 

04:31:20
MIKE RHODES That would be a different kind of video recording. 

04:31:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, it's a, it's a very. 

04:31:30
MIKE RHODES Actually I do sort of contemplate about do I need a shave? Can I get away with not shaving today? No one knows me in Tucson. So what. You know. 

04:31:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Today. And if you blow off one day, does it ruin the consistency of your shaving? 

04:31:45
MIKE RHODES No, because all shave tomorrow. 

04:31:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Exactly. Exactly. 

04:31:50
MIKE RHODES Oh, I like that. That was good. 

04:31:50
MICHAEL YAPKO That was good. 

04:31:55
MIKE RHODES I like that. Good. 

04:31:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. You know, the whole idea of course, is to take it out of the realm of being an intellectual construct and getting it so that it's really just part of who you are and part of what you do. 

04:32:05
MIKE RHODES Absolutely. And, I am convinced I had that experience as well as conviction that connecting that mind and the body works, and what's been working against me is that I don't feel like it. It's not a matter so much of contemplation. It's just. 

04:32:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, but you see the, the fact that you even entertain that feeling is the first step. 

04:32:35
MIKE RHODES Depression. 

04:32:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Towards the whole thing, following apart. So it seems to me a really good use of this session, see if you agree with me, is moving it into that realm where it's beyond contemplation. 

04:32:50
MIKE RHODES That, that would be great. 

04:32:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, then let's. You said you'd had some experience with hypnosis before? 

04:33:00
MIKE RHODES Sure. Love it. 

04:33:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah? 

04:33:00
MIKE RHODES Yeah, and as far as my practice, I do it most of my practice. 

04:33:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. 

04:33:05
MIKE RHODES I do student counseling with university students. 

04:33:10
MICHAEL YAPKO And what happens with them? How do you use it with them? 

04:33:15
MIKE RHODES Test anxiety, uh, focus, fears and phobias, insomnia, sports motivation, motivation to, you know, just build on their resources and to do better. 

04:33:30
MICHAEL YAPKO So, the students you're working with are generally younger people? 

04:33:35
MIKE RHODES Uh, generally graduate students, med students, law students. Some undergrad. 

04:33:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Mid-20s is typical? 

04:33:40
MIKE RHODES Uh, late twenties to forties. 

04:33:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Late twenties. Oh really? Okay. 

04:33:45
MIKE RHODES And, uh, all highly motivated, articulate, intelligent, accomplished. It's amazing. 

04:33:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, that's great. 

04:33:55
MIKE RHODES Terrific. 

04:33:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Fun being in an academic environment, isn't it? 

04:34:00
MIKE RHODES Yeah. 

04:34:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, then let's take all these great things that you know, and let's start to put them together a little bit differently. So, I'll rely on you now to do what you know how to do. That's right. Arrange yourself in whatever way is comfortable. Do whatever adjustments you need to do in order to make it possible for your body to be relaxed. And while I'm, of course, very interested in encouraging a sense of comfort, at the very same time I'm really interested in how you deal with discomfort. Two sides of the same coin. And a really curious use of comfort is to get comfortable with discomfort in the most comfortable of ways. And when you find yourself growing comfortable with being uncomfortable at times, you really end up wondering where the discomfort went. Something I'm curious about in a comfortable sort of way. But while your body grows more relaxed, a breath at a time, in moment at a time, I'm really curious how your thoughts will begin to narrow. How you will find them moving in a very different direction. And if I was to characterized that direction, I'd say it's movement in the direction of getting comfortable with movements that are comfortable and uncomfortable. I was really interested to hear that you work with students. Now I have no idea you've been doing that for, but however long it's been it's been long enough to notice how students sometimes complicate their own lives. Sometimes or elaborate reasons, and sometimes for some pretty silly reasons. A guy who falls out of a window trying to impress a girl, not a stellar example of deep intelligence. Yet others who have real great reasons for why they want to perform so well on a test in a course, in a program. And you find yourself in the position of offering advice, input. And sometimes the advice is pretty obvious, at least to you even though it isn't obvious to the student. And it's what gives a great deal of credence to Mark Twain's observation that it isn't what you don't know that hurts you. It's what you know that isn't so. But, I think he was only half right about that, because sometimes what you don't know can be pretty disruptive. And here you are in this comfortable position of being able to focus your attention and openly acknowledge what you know and what you know that isn't so about yourself. There are a lot of things that you do that are part of your job, that are fun, exhilarating. When somebody tells you what a huge difference you made in their life. And when you are sitting with that person, you are entirely removed from the question, "Do I want to be here?" because it was abundantly obvious that the question was moot, because you already were there. And when you decided to work on your degree, you didn't really have to spend much time exploring how you felt about midterms or finals. You didn't really need to do much journaling about the impact of midterms on your life. You didn't really have to contemplate deeply whether you felt like taking notes in class. They were just things you did. And what a curious thing, Mike, that you have the ability to be fully attached, deeply attached to things that you contemplate, things you choose. And when I said earlier in another context that if you're incredibly organized, there are 24 hours in a day. And if you're incredibly disorganized, there are 24 hours in a day. And there's a very good chance for as long as you're alive that every morning you're going to wake up, and certainly that was one of the most valuable pieces of information and advice that Milton Erickson offered when he said that the key to a long life was to wake up every morning, and the way to assure that you would wake up every morning was to drink a lot before you went to bed. That's good advice. Now all the other things are negotiable. I knew one fellow who placed alarm clocks in three different places. It got him out of bed every morning. I knew another fellow who paid one of the neighborhood kids to pound on his door until he was on the porch in his gym clothes. Ten bucks a week. Got him a lot of workouts. And I knew someone else who had a workout buddy, just as you suggested with a little twist. That he'd have to pay 25 bucks if he didn't show up on time. He only had a couple of very expensive workouts over the span of years. Now, it's a curious thing what happens when it's more important to complete the course than it is to feel comfortable. What happens when it's more important to do the task than it is to feel all warm and fuzzy? And isn't it a curious thing as you see younger and younger students how times have changed and values have changed. You and I are roughly the same age. Grew up with the value of education for education sake. The value of knowledge, the value of knowing. Now, I don't know if you've ever watched Jay Leno's show, and the segment he does called jaywalking, where he goes out and asks people questions that anybody with an IQ three points above a house plant should be able to answer. What color is the White House? Extraordinary how much people don't know, because they don't see the purpose in it. Why listen to a lecture unless you first asked the professor is this going to be on the test? What a shift in attitude to value education for the sake of education. To bargaining, why should I have to? And I'm curious about the transition within you. Of how it became a process of bargaining. All I know is one of the best answers continues to be because I said so. It's worked for a lot of folks in many different contexts. But when you contemplate all the things that you don't contemplate, that's right. Absorb the deeper implications. There comes a time when it isn't about convenience, when it isn't about what's easy. That's one of the most difficult concepts to grasp, how to choose wisely. When some people choose according to what's easiest and some choose according to what's best. What a difference in outcome. I'm encouraging you to move beyond easy, to work up enough sweat that's best knowing there's a benefit beyond the moment. But, it takes a refined ability to think beyond the moment, beyond the meanings and well into the realm of exercising your choice to do it best. Now, it's always a curious thing to me when people ask what's best? My first question is best for what? Best for looking good? Feeling good? Being healthy? Being able to brag? Here's how far I ran today or here's how much weight I lifted today. It's a curious thing. And when you think about the students you work with, how do you encourage them to think beyond what's easy? How do you facilitate an acceptance that the program is challenging, but worth doing? 

04:54:00
[sil.] 

04:54:00
MICHAEL YAPKO That's right. So in describing jaywalking there's an invitation in there to have a much smarter answer when you ask yourself the question. And speaking of questions, there's a question in my mind as to what you are aware of at this point in time. So in just a moment I'm going to ask you, Mike, to describe out loud, continuing to be comfortable, more comfortable with each word you say, what you're aware of experiencing. So if you would describe out loud, please. 

04:55:35
[sil.] 

04:55:35
MIKE RHODES It's hard to speak. I hear every word. Is it me or has the air-conditioning gone off. It's hot. My hands are heavy. I'm surprised I'm hearing every word. It's sort of amused by the rapid eye movement, tearing and swallowing. 

04:56:40
MICHAEL YAPKO It's just interesting to be absorbed in that way, isn't it? 

04:56:50
MIKE RHODES Love the whole idea of embracing the discomfort and becoming comfortable. 

04:57:00
MICHAEL YAPKO I think that's a good thing to embrace. 

04:57:10
MIKE RHODES It's one of those things you talk to your clients about, and it's like, duh, I could've had a V-8. I'm new at this but, it's this connection with the body and the mind. I'm I'm not going to, the discomfort is the proof in the pudding. 

04:57:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Some of the best sore muscles you'll ever have. 

04:57:40
MIKE RHODES Overcoming the fear of anything. 

04:57:45
MICHAEL YAPKO That's right. 

04:57:50
MIKE RHODES Just do it. And Jeff said something earlier. I love the switching letters between got to do it and get to do it. 

04:58:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. it's good, Mike. You can just continue now to enjoy the comfort. And as you start embracing the comfort of the discomfort, how soon does discomfort become comfort, and how soon after that does it become just what you do. No real attachment one way or the other. And to really enjoy that capacity and different people handle it so differently. Some people come up to me and say, "Wow, you must really like writing books." And the truth is hell no, I don't like writing books. And if I had to wait until I woke up and felt like editing, that feeling comes around about twice a century. But, what a curious thing to have the same ability that you obviously have in other places that you're just extending into. That it's just something you do. One foot in front of the other, keeping your little legs moving. And enjoying when it's done and how it feels. And when you find yourself telling yourself it wasn't easiest, but it was well, you know. Now, out of all the things that I've talked about from late night TV to students who harangue professors about what they have to know, there can be a lingering sense of crossing a threshold in the best of ways. And what a relief to discover you don't have to be 100 percent committed. You just have to show up and look reasonably alert. 

05:02:10
[sil.] 

05:02:10
MICHAEL YAPKO And so we can take what you said and use it as the best of ways of representing this session. 

05:02:40
[sil.] 

05:02:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Take whatever time you'd like to, Mike, to process and absorb knowing motivation is variable. There isn't anything that you're always going to want to do, and even the things you love doing, you don't always wanted to. And what you're learning and absorbing are the ways of keeping yourself on track. And right now, you just don't wanna and something else rises from within that says it may not be easiest, it may not be the most convenient, but, and I'd say it's a big but, but were actually talking about a smaller one. Take whatever time you'd like to absorb the deeper implication and just when you'll choose to reorient yourself, hard to know, but I assume you'll do it when it's best. 

05:05:30
[sil.] 

05:05:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi. 

05:05:45
MIKE RHODES Worth the price of the conference. 

05:05:55
[sil.] 

05:05:55
MICHAEL YAPKO That's good. Just breathe. 

05:06:05
MIKE RHODES Perfect. 

05:06:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Perfect. Do you feel like talking about it a little bit or would you prefer to just, Sorry? 

05:06:20
MIKE RHODES I'm processing it. 

05:06:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

05:06:20
MIKE RHODES Also I love your stories and that you do all the talking. You checked in a bit. And, that's a lot my style, because I know personally it's a real trance color for me to talk in trance. And so, even just okay, I want to respond. It's like I can't. And. 

05:06:45
MICHAEL YAPKO But, it kind of develops a momentum of its own, doesn't it? 

05:06:50
MIKE RHODES It was wonderful that connecting to myself doing therapy with clients, and relating to what they are talking about. Their discomfort with whatever the situation is, and wanting to avoid it. It's like, no, just do it, whether it's research and writing the dissertation or paperwork for work or just exercising to just keep moving, work up a sweat. And it's like, yeah, wonderful. 

05:07:40
MICHAEL YAPKO That's great. That's great. 

05:07:45
MIKE RHODES My past experience is not to hear everything. I mean after a couple of paragraphs just going out and then waking up at the end. But, it was wonderful to hear every word. 

05:08:00
MICHAEL YAPKO It held your attention throughout the process. 

05:08:05
MIKE RHODES And yet, being aware that, oh, okay, nothing else is working. just letting that mind and body connect. Love Ernest Rossi's presentation Friday night. I mean, I, you know, intuitively and through reading, experience with cliens and stuff, I love to see that there's research there. I'm seeing all my DNA and RNA going green and red, you know, based on that. 

05:08:35
MICHAEL YAPKO It's amazing. Ernie was a man ahead of his time, but even just this last year there was another study that was done at Harvard on Herb Benson's relaxation stuff. They did DNA micro arrays, trained them in, how to do relaxation kinds of things. Six weeks later is, do DNA micro arrays again, and more than 1500 genes changed in measurable ways. Just nice to know that there's, there's something actually happening on many different levels. Certainly, how you think about things, but also what's happening there. 

05:09:15
MIKE RHODES Well, and to know it and then letting it happen within two different things the last couple of years. 

05:09:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Exactly. Yeah. 

05:09:20
MIKE RHODES And I've been searching for this experience to connect again with my body. Thank you very very much. 

05:09:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you, Mike. I appreciate it a lot. 

05:09:35
[sil.] 

05:09:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Take one of these with you as a thank you for doing that. I appreciate it a lot. 

05:09:50
[sil.] 

05:09:50
MICHAEL YAPKO How are we doing on time? It's about five after four. 

05:10:05
[sil.] 

05:10:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Something to process from your side first, should you want it. 

05:10:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Uh, it represents for me a very common theme of therapy. You know, people think that somehow they're supposed to always feel motivated. And the reality is motivation varies hugely. And the trick is how to get yourself to do things when you're not motivated to do things. And I think this is one of the things that I learned really well from reading Erickson's work. Something I learned really well from spending as much time with Jay Haley as I did, that when internal motivation lags, how you use the external environment to support yourself. And so, in that respect it's a pretty repetitive or common theme of therapy, and I just really wanted to help Mike get that sense that this isn't about you always being motivated. That's not a realistic expectation. It's going to be about how you deal you with yourself on those days when you're not. 

05:11:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, right. Beautiful. So, motivation is a little overrated, and motivation could be considered the dessert. It can be considered the byproduct of investing things with meaning. As you invest things with meaning you become motivated. And motivation can be seen as an afterthought rather than a precursor. So, when somebody comes in and they're saying, "I want to be motivated to exercise.", Then the choice that we have is to finesse that and not necessarily work directly with helping the person to access motivation. And that's what Michael did, you know, beautifully. And that is I think, the best choice in these situations. Motivation is a wanna wanna problem. I wanna wanna. And so, those kinds of problems are secondary emotions. So if somebody who is anorexic comes in and says, "I want to want to eat." Or somebody who is been seriously chronically depressed for some period of time and says, "I want to want to be happy." And to those wanna wanna problems are somewhat difficult. Now, being hypnotists, we have a choice and may be I might have taken a shot with Mike about working with motivation and accessing motivation because he was such a good hypnotic subject. And, a possible choice would've been to say okay, we hypnotists, we can work with states. And, it would be breaking the rule because my rule is more similar to Michael's. But possibly, okay, what could we do to access motivation. Well, we can access trance. If we can access trance, and he's so good at it, maybe he can access motivation. And, this would be one of those rare examples were I might try to go, go into that direction because he was so successful with his own self hypnosis. I thought that, you know, the metaphors were spectacular. They were really wonderful. And the metaphors, the verbal metaphors and the word plays. They were just so lovely. You know, like that last final wordplay about big butt to a small butt. You know, those are such, it's sleight of mouth. Not sleight-of-hand, sleight of mouth. And those little things, they just stick with you and have a way of fermenting inside your soul and coming alive. So I, I think that whatever we're oriented in that direction, probably the best person that I ever saw orient in that direction was Kay Thompson, who was one of Erickson's first-generation students. There's a wonderful book about her work. And, she was instrumental in my training. I, I don't have that facility. I have some of that facility. And it's wonderful to see Michael, who's developed that facility, to use stories and, and metaphors and make those stories and metaphors take these ideas and make them come alive. And you see a little juxtaposition of difference because Michael's a little more cognitive in his strategy, and I'm a little bit more dramatic and experiential in my strategy. And, they are complementary. And you have to move to the call of your own drummer on these things. And, you know, I would create more experiential moments that are embodied. And Michael's facility at using stories and metaphors is fabulous. And so that's a tool he uses with incredible grace. And so the idea of establishing the trance then developing reference experiences, little common every day examples, strategies. And using the trance to talk about the strategies so that the person can interiorize those strategies. I, you know, think that, that's a really beautiful. Pablo Casals, the cellist, said that every morning he got up and he wrote music from nine till twelve. He wasn't waiting for inspiration. This was his job. He did music from nine to twelve. He created music from nine till twelve. And, wasn't, you know, like we would think, I have to wait for my creative inspiration then I do music. So, the concept here is a concept of procedural memory. And when we get things to or procedural memory, like brushing our teeth are putting on our clothes or shaving, then we don't think about them anymore. So, for me, exercise is in my procedural memory. And so then I have to think, well how do I access these things? That's a common every day example. What is it your procedural memory? So, when I heard this I had a concept for a category of procedural memory. And, I don't know whether Michael have that concept cognitively, but he certainly had it metaphorically. Get the concept. Start spinning some common everyday examples. Start to orient the person to wake up and then it's like montage. Montage is the power of juxtaposition, which is used endlessly in movies, except you never realize it. But, the power of montage was, you know, discovered by the Russian, early Russian movie makers who understood how to make cuts. And at first when movies were invented in the early 1900s, they just took pictures. And they didn't understand cuts. And they didn't understand montage. But montage is the power of juxtaposition. So, if you see a man blank faced, and then the next thing you see is a bowl of soup, the juxtaposition is you understand that he's hungry. Commercials use this all the time. The power of montage. So, if you see a blank man, the same blank man and then the next picture is a little girl with the teddy bear, you ascribe nurturing to him. This is the power of montage. If you see the same man and the next slide or movie scene is a woman standing over a casket, you understand that this man is being empathic. And that's the power of montage. So, if you get a category of procedural memory and then you start spinning a series of metaphors around procedural memory, you start awakening those representations inside the person, and the power of montage allows the person to connect. So, it's a kind of the unique parallelism. You don't have to, you don't have to say, you know, Juliet is the most beautiful, wonderful, incredible thing in the world. Shakespeare says Juliet is the sun. Immediately you get it. Juliet is the sun. And that's the power of metaphor. And, it's so much greater than the sum of its parts. So, when you get the concept and then you start using the metaphors to awaken the concept, everything becomes, you know, hunky-dory and develops into, it, its own rhythm. And I love watching Michael work. And I love see the way that he spins those metaphors and, you know, just so fluidly and facilely, those, those wordplays. And I have have no doubt that Mike will accomplish all of the things he set out to do. 

05:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you, Jeff. 

05:19:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Well. What they journey, huh? 

05:19:40
[sil.] 

05:19:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Let's moved to the center aisle microphone if there are any questions that you have. 

05:19:55
UNKNOWN I have a quick question that's based on both of your backgrounds, and Mike, yours in particular. Michael, yours in particular. In both of your sessions, it seemed as if you made attempts to kind of regress the patient in some ways in the first session, going back to college and then, well, doctorate and then graduate school and then before you are declaring your major and before you declared your major, which implies regression. And then in the second session, get your little legs moving. Younger and younger, the students that you work with. And I can't forget the, I can't remember actually the other one. But it seemed that it was kind of woven in. I guess my question is this. I'll get to it. Do both of you believe in the unconscious in more of a chronological way. It seems like the way I kind of envision and the work that I saw was there was a cross pollinization across different chronological aspects of the unconscious. And at one point, Michael, you said we're about the same age, kind of bringing him up to the present. And then, you know, maybe, whatever you can do with that thought. 

05:21:10
MICHAEL YAPKO You know, for me it's about recognizing that at every phase of life there are usable resources, and so rather than somebody restricting themselves to their current view of themselves, which is rigid in some way, limited in some way, how can I move you through all different times of your life and all the different ways that you define yourself across life to emphasize that one major point that your view of yourself, your self definition, needs to be fluid and, and malleable as opposed to fixed and rigid. 

05:21:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And I would take, I would, you know, one of the, there's been many definitions of hypnosis. And Brenman and Gill, you know, the psychoanalytic writers about hypnosis, talk about hypnosis as their regression in the service of the ego. And it's, it's an allowable, you allow yourself to regress a little bit, maybe in terms of the operator, using traditional language, operating on the experience of the person. Now, that's a kind of regressive relationship. And so, the person who allows themselves to be open is in a slightly regressed, one down, depends on what language you want to use. Now, if you think about the unconscious as a repository of learning and that these are the things that we have accrued over history, then you think about it active unconscious like you shouldn't have the word unconscious, maybe it should be preconscious anyway, except the word which we much more facilely use is unconscious. And, may be the concept should be unconsciousing, like like when you turn a nominalized noun, the unconscious, into a gerund because it's really something that's really fluid over time, and it's not a thing. But, what we talk about the unconscious, it's as if were making it into a thing. So, it's unconsciousing. It's a process. And then, the regression is this was probably Erickson's most common induction was doing something regressive, like reminding somebody about learning to write to the letters of the alphabet. If the induction wasn't even straight age progression induction, where he was using age reduction as the induction fixation device. And part of the reason for that is that the resources are located in memory. And if you start to help the person access their memory, having the parallelism, which Michael did very nicely, this, this idea of parallelism where the induction parallels the therapy. And the induction becomes a metaphor of the therapy to follow. The induction becomes a hologram of the therapy to follow. So, in traditional hypnosis, induction is a method to go into trance. Now I do the induction. And then discrete segue. Now I'm doing the therapy. And there's no relationship. But for Erickson, it was holographic. The induction flowed seamlessly. It's like wearing black socks and black pants. It's a seamless transition. That was funny I thought. So, it's a seamless transition from the induction into the of therapy. And when you get to that level, your really working at a solid journeyman level, when you can coordinate the induction with the therapy to follow. So, if the therapy is to be about awakening resources that exist in history, there should be some regressive flavor to the induction so that it really follows the therapy, so the therapy to follow is primed by the induction. I should write that sometime. 

05:25:25
UNKNOWN I have a couple of questions about exercise. How many members of the audience exercise regularly? Let me see your hands. How many of you prescribe exercise for your patients? Well, I'll tell you something about myself and then when I do. When I came to the first conference in 1980, I was on the plane. And the fellow that I knew who was a Delta pilot who was flying on the plane said, "Sheldon, are you coming out to run the Fiesta Bowl Marathon?" I said, "What?" Well, the next thing I knew I was on a bus going 26 miles out into the desert before dawn, because you had to do it because it got so damn hot. And, that tells you something about me. Now, what there is about a marathon is that you go, there are chemicals called endorphins. And you go into a trance. And I can't tell you much of what I did at the most of the marathons I used to run, but you know, you get a great great feeling. Now, how do I apply this to my patients? In 1995, there was an excellent article in the JAMA, in JAMA. And if you give me your cards, I'll send you the reference. But, it's called, "Physical Activity and Public Health". And it's like an Erickson seal of approval. Ken Cooper and the people at CDC, real gurus of exercise came up with this brilliant idea that everybody needed 30 minutes of moderate exercise every the day. But, they didn't say you had to be at nut like me and go out and run the marathons or do things like that. You could incorporate it in your everyday life. And so, people go up and down steps. They walk a little in parking lots. And, I give this to my patients usually the first or second visit. And I stay after them about what they've done. Now, I continue to be active. I quit marathons after, you don't do marathons after you have a hip replacement. It slows you down a bit. But now, I build it into my daily life, and this is what I recommend to people. You find something you like to do that may be something you have done. But, I tell people there's no easy pass. You've got to give yourself, and I say that I'm a coach. You've got to give yourself at least six months. If they used to play tennis, I'll suggest they go back to tennis or swimming or what have you. And, if they stick with that, and I have a number of couch potatoes who now are certified, have become certified marathon runners, much less than that they go out every day. And so, I have patients build this into their lives. And I tell them, and it's true, this will help you more than any pills I can give you. And, many times they don't believe it, but when they start taking this pill it helps. Thank you. 

05:28:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you, Sheldon. 

05:28:50
[sil.] 

05:28:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Is that it? One more. 

05:29:00
UNKNOWN Just a quick one. At the beginning he presented a problem and kind of defined it medically as a thyroid problem and not producing enough testosterone and the related feeling of fatigue, low energy, to that. Because Michael, I remember in previous sessions that you talked about kind of medical based hypnosis in terms of visualizing like a kind of a healing ball of light that had purify healing energy and it, moving through the body and energizing the person and healing the person. I'm kind of wondering why you didn't go in that direction? 

05:29:50
MICHAEL YAPKO First of all, you definitely have me mixed up with somebody else, because that has never been one of my things is healing balls of light going through your body. That's just way too granola for me. So.

UNKNOWN You had the audience divided in half, if you remember that one, where you had us one half of the audience engaged in some exercise like that, and the other half didn't and then you made the point that, you know, a few years, ten years from now, twenty years from now, if they did some kind of a statistical study of that that those that did it would be in it a healthier condition than those that didn't. You don't recall that?

MICHAEL YAPKO I can tell you it's not me that you're remembering. However, I will speak to the larger point of what you're asking about. That here is a guy who has had some medical issues. He's been treated for them. He was apparently satisfied with that treatment. He wasn't asking me for any kind of physical health intervention to raise his testosterone level or improve his thyroid. He, he narrowed the field of the interaction to I'd like to exercise more, but I'm not doing that. So, how might I approach this differently? And, I stayed within the field of what he asked me about.

UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you.

JEFFREY ZEIG You know, it's an incredible thing for Michael and I. We make ourselves public. Remember that therapy has not been traditionally, at least in the first 75 years of its existence, a public phenomenon. People didn't necessarily show what they do. And so, I'm very appreciative to Michael for having the courage of not only his convictions, but the courage of his fantasies and saying, "Okay, we'll show you what we do, good, bad or indifferent. We'll just, you know, put ourselves out there and do our best to help people. And not only that, to educate you." So, I am, you know, very grateful for the opportunity, because that was a promise that I made to myself, was to be transparent, good, bad or indifferent, and show what I do. And I'm really glad that there are people like Michael of the world who are willing to do the same. And so, thank you all so much for coming and making this all possible.
