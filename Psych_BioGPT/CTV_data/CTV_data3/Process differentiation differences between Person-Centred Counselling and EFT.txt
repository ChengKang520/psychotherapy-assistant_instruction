Process differentiation: differences between Person-Centred Counselling and EFT 

00:00:15
ROBERT ELLIOTT So the difference between Person-Centred Counselling and emotion focus therapy umm… is not just about whether uh… where the therapy is being process guiding or suggesting the client talk to chairs umm… more importantly uh… uh… EFT has a much higher degree of process differentiation. And this refers to the um… time that EFT therapists have spent looking very carefully at the therapy process and all the different aspects or types of therapy process that uh… we have developed or, or identified and learned to proceed over umm… .umm… several decades of work in development of the EFT. So in EFT umm… there is not just one kind of good client process uh… that might be measured by say the client experiencing scale which is like you know, describing experience uh… and um, familiar issues around it. There are other kinds of clients of good client process uh… including accessing strong emotions, reflecting on your emotions after you have been in a process so, so EFT differentiates different kinds of your client process. We also differentiate different kinds of empathy so uh… we think that you know empathy for that going to main point the clients trying to tell us is one kind of empathy but there's also empathy for the sudden new answers in the… what the persons saying or the experiences that just emerging and they experience um… that uh… this is a different kind of empathy and you have to distinguishes six or seven different kinds of empathy umm… ranging engine from the main point to uh… what's emotional most emotionally pointing to uh… things that are difficult to talk about with the client, mentions and then pushes away so, so topics that are being avoided umm… to the sense of the whole person. So there is many different ways of listening empathically to our clients and we have to, to try to employ all of them at different times. But it's also important to recognize umm.. the different ways of being empathic because it helps us develop more fully our skills in empathy. Umm… there, there are many other kinds of process differentiation but in my experience umm… this degree of differentiation of different kinds of process has been the greatest struggle for umm… umm… more classically trained persons and our counseling therapists are trying to learn EFT. And uh… therapists who often said to me that they worry about umm… umm… all the different concepts and worried in things in EFT and they, what they worry about is that they will go, it'll push them into their heads and they will stop listening to their clients will stopping empathic and obviously you know, empathic in two minutes always the, the first thing in a "person-centred experiential or emotion focus therapy". So we don't want to interfere with the empathy and so I tell my you know, people who are coming to study EFT that umm… we use these concepts to reflect on our process umm… In EFT the important thing is to have an experience some with our clients, some with our selves we have an experience we try something out. Umm… and then we have afterwards we step back and reflect them on it. Umm… .and so we bring the head and heart together and we have to first the heart has the experience emotions happen and then we uh… access our head or properly the new parts of our brain then cortex. We access those to reflect on what's happened? And that's the place where the EFT concepts can be re-useful and every time you reflect on your practice uh… it changes you, it changes you, the next time you go and work with the clients. So you bring a little bit of that reflection into it and that begins to gradually differentiate your process. So in the EFT you know we say, you know we learn things one at a time umm… and much of learning EFT is about this process of differentiation. So for example for therapy to task umm… like umm… empty chair work for umm… unfinished business for so important people in your life but the first thing to know about that task is that there is a "task" that clients routinely bring to us about unresolved painful feelings about important people in their lives. And uh… it's really important first to just know that the specific kind of a work. So the first thing is to actually know the task and if we know the task then we'll on the same page of our clients uh… we won't be you know trying to work with an internal conflict when the external client wants to resolve uh… you know, un… un… you know un… resolved grief with the parent for example umm… and so that's the process of differentiation will start just by having empathy for what the client brings us their intentionality, their agency, the task they offer us in the session. And then the next thing we want to learn is generally what you do with an unfinished business marker? And that generally to have the client, have a conversation with that important person in your life. And when you're learning EFT that's you know, those are the first two steps right? And then we go from there, everything else is details that people develop over time little bit like uh… picture coming into focus you know first you can only see the broad outline and then if you sharp and the focus of the picture umm… you begin to see more, more details. And that's I think how learning EFT works also when people manage uh… to master that high level of process differentiation.
