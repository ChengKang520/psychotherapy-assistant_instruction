UNKNOWN We now have a wonderful, esteemed panel with three other faculty members. We have Alex Katehakis, Stan Tatkin and Marty Klein and I bet there isn't a person in this audience who hasn't had a question sometime about something to do with lies and infidelity, two such easy topics. So what they're going to do for the panel is each of them will talk for somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes, if they… if they go past their 10, I'll probably shut them up and then they're going to talk to each other for a few minutes, and then we're going to open it up to questions. So when you go to the mike, I mean, you'll need to go to the mike with your questions. And I want you to keep the questions really brief, so write down as my question is and get right to it so we can cover a lot of questions. So I believe that Stan is going first. 

00:01:40
STAN TATKIN No, Marty. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Oh, Marty. 

00:01:40
MARTY KLEIN Oh no, no. And he just told me… 

00:01:45
STAN TATKIN You said you'll anything I want. So, I said you go first. It's that I'm the youngest of my family so I just follow. Okay, all right, so we're going to be talking about lies and infidelity and infidelity in my mind isn't just having an affair or cheating on your partner. Infidelity is you know, breaking rules of governance or principles of governance or the social contract between you and your partner. So rather than just keep it limited to sex or sexual acting out, infidelity is anything that breaks that trust, anything that astray from the social contract that the both partners hopefully, explicitly have most partners do not have explicit social agreements. So that's my take on infidelity but however, we tend to think of infidelity as affairs and cheating with someone I mean, we would be talking about that in my workshop, today on betrayal. So I'll hold that for them. And in terms of lying that also I'm going to be covering tomorrow at, for my keynote, so do come because I'll be talking about all the ways you can pick up lies and deception in your partners. It's always fun. So that I'll be going into uh… in depth, but there actual lying, people who actually will lie, not white lies but you know, purposely trying to mislead you. And that is part of the human condition. Lying is part of being human and the better you are at lying, the more socially, emotionally intelligent you are. One of the ways we determine in couples therapy how good a liar is. Is whether they can sort of pass master in some way, how complex is their lying. Although liars can always be tripped up so that no matter how good they are at it, they're not that good. But you can… you can always tell the level of complexity, level of development by the quality of a lie. How well somebody does it. So there's also other kinds of deception such as deflecting or even I think, the worst one is gas lighting which I'll also be talking about tomorrow. Something that is very much a part of our lives right now, in terms of our political situation. Gas lighting is where you deflect by making the other person the problem. There's something wrong with the other person, right. And that's a particularly pernicious kind you know, terms in the lying area, very hard to get out of once you start doing that in a relationship, very hard to fix. So all kinds of lying and then there's… then there's something much more common than that. And that is people saying things they know nothing about. And that's the more common thing. You know if you've been around me you know how I think about this. Real time is too fast for all of us to track what we're doing. We're mostly automatic, we're mostly driven by memory. We have to be that way otherwise we couldn't get through a day. So since, we are memory driven and were automatic and reflexive, most of the time when we engaging in real time we are acting reacting automatically with memory, and we basically don't know what we're talking about what we're doing. We don't really know what the other person is doing either. We think we know, we're reacting very quickly through a process of recognition, not thinking recognition. So on that level people are making stuff up all the time. People who are coming into our office they're saying things that they think are factually true and they're not. We see things that are of what we think are factually true and they're not. The ability to make shit up is… is one of the brilliant parts of our brain. That's what we do. What we don't know we make up, what we can't see we fill in with blanks and that's not lying. That is the another part of the human condition that we have to look out for. Which means we can't really trust narratives ever, narratives lie. The body doesn't but narratives do lie. So if you're going to be tracking lying whether it's somebody who's actually trying to pull one over on you or their partner or doesn't know what they're talking about like most of us. It is a good thing to be able to track what somebody is doing, how they're communicating, how they're interacting, whether there's they're above board or not, through other means other than tracking what they say. We have ways we'll talk about tomorrow of tracking incoherence and in non collaborative speech that point to deception and lying but it's not definitive, none of this is actually definitive but you'll see tomorrow and somewhat today too in our panel and then in the workshop how this figures in, in the clinical room. That's about it.

ALEX KATEHAKIS So I concur with Stan. I was thinking about infidelity myself yesterday and I was thinking about how unfaithful I've been my entire life. I've lied, I've stolen, I've cheated from the time I can remember because I think there's something delicious about getting away with something. It's highly arousing. It makes us feel powerful and excitatory and so we are can be unfaithful in our relationships in many ways without never having sex with anybody. We can lie about finances, about one of the things I learned from my mother was that we would go shopping, this is so bizarre she would take us shopping in the fall for back to school clothes. We'd spend the day shopping and we'd come home and leave it all in the trunk so that when we walked in the door my father didn't know she spent any money. But then we'd be in new clothes all fall. So this was their way of playing whatever game they played. But that was you know, sort of an early set up that you know, don't ask don't tell sort of thing. So with that, we see or I see this kind of infidelity in relationships all the time between people and I think it happens for many reasons. Most of all the terror of truly being vulnerable with another, to really trusting ourselves with another human being. Now most of you probably know that I don't work with a single incident affairs. The people that come into my office have been sexually compulsive, sometimes their entire lives or they identified as sexually addicted or whatever their preference is and what I see in that is a deep, deep level of dissociation. And what we know about dissociation, Stan was pointing to is that it's composed of three states. The first of which is automaticity, this highly automatic brain that we have that runs without thinking so that we can function. It's evolutionary, it's adaptive, it's necessary in order for us to get from here to lounge (ph). So that's a big part of these adaptive patterns that people are running. And the second is compartmentalization, which we see in addicts of all stripes and that is the unconscious sequestering of material whether it's because it happened in an egregious way early, early on, infantile, un repaired assaults, terror or trauma in childhood or what have you. But that is really an uncoupling of the upper right part of the brain the high functions down into the body. So these parts, these circuits are not speaking to each other. There's a deadness at the core that has people doing all sorts of things and oftentimes they do know they're lying and compartmentalizing certain behaviors but tell themselves it's not that bad or I still love my partner or what people don't know won't hurt them and that becomes an adaptive pattern also. And then, finally altered states of consciousness which are very traumatic defenses against trauma when they're coming down the pipe. We've all heard the story of the person saying they were being molested and they were on the ceiling watching that scenario. That's a more extreme version but I do see extreme dissociation in the patients that I treat, who have cheated not once twice but you know over 20 years repeatedly on their partners and with that comes a gross amount of childhood trauma. So the deception is not just the deception of the other, its self deception. And self-deception I find quite fascinating, the way we lie to ourselves all the time. So I think these are complex problems. The more infidelity the more complicated it gets because of these traumatic issues. So my lens is really seeing these problems of sexual compulsivity and addiction as a problem of deep affective dysregulation. And again, these are not the same reasons people have single incident affairs. I think that's a whole different category. Thank you.

MARTY KLEIN You guys tricked me. I thought we were all going to have our slides, so now I feel silly. But I'll manage, don't worry. So the assignment we got was come up with seven, eight, nine minutes about infidelity and I thought well, that's twice as much time as I need. But, so I actually do a whole… a whole weekend workshop on infidelity around the country for therapists so I went to that two day seminar slides and just picked out one theme from the slides that I want to talk to you about and that's we all… we all agree that we're all systemic and everybody agrees that you should treat things systemically. So what I want to talk to today very briefly is about power dynamics after the affair is disclosed whether it's one time or… or a lot. And one of the things that we… okay, well, I guess put it on hold, there you go. One of the things that happens is that couples quarrel about the narrative of what happened. Was it intentional or was it not. Did it happen or did I do it. And we need to make sure that we have couples trying to come up with a narrative cooperatively, one preferably one narrative cooperatively and one of… one of the things that sometimes occurs is… is that the person has been betrayed or feels betrayed says that they can't help, they can't help what they think. And I think, we shouldn't let somebody slide on that. You know everybody is responsible for the narrative that they create about what happened. You can't, you're not responsible for what somebody else does but you're responsible for the story you put together about what they did. And one of the things that people do when they have been betrayed is that they come up with these ghastly stories, these horrible stories such as since… because you had an affair that means every single time in the last 20 years that you told me you love me, it was a lie. Which is just not accurate or nothing is the way that it seemed like it was. Now I think, you know one of the most destabilizing things about your partner having an affair or whatever the betrayal is, is that people doubt their own sense of what's real and what's not real. And… and that's a lot worse than where you want to put their genitalia in most ways. That said, when people say nothing is the way that it's saying, when you said that you were proud of our son that was untrue or when you uh… you know said you enjoyed that weekend in the wine country, that wasn't true. And that is an incredibly hurtful story that the betrayed may be telling themselves. And it's just… it's just surplus pain, it's surplus powerlessness and surplus pain. Another assumption that the betrayed sometimes makes is that well, now that you've betrayed me now I own the relationship. Now you get to do what I want. I get to decide what the penance is going to be, I get to decide what your rights are. Frequently what I hear is that the person who had the affair has to move out temporarily and I say, why… why… why does… why does he have to move out temporarily and she'll say well, I don't want to sleep with the son of a bitch. I said well, why don't you move out. Not because I want her to move out but because what… what is the assumption that just because somebody has an affair they lose all of their rights. I have… I have a lease at my office that has a clause called severability that if you… if you… if one of the clauses of the lease is found to be non… non-viable, the rest of the lease is still in place. And I think, we need… we need something like that in couples where there's an affair or some sort of betrayal that just because you betrayed your partner in this way over here doesn't mean you lose access to your kids, doesn't mean you lose access to your bed, doesn't mean you lose access to the dignity of the rest of your family. So I encourage therapists to look at the assumptions that the betrayed is making and to ask are those assumptions helpful? Are they warranted? And why does that person suddenly have so much more power in a relationship? And if… if the person has been betrayed insist on telling these ghastly stories about their own victimization, therapists of course, we're very sympathetic and we want to… we want to sympathize with the pain of the person who's been betrayed. I think sometimes we might go a little too far and really collude with the overwhelming, with the decision to be an overwhelming victim. The decision that I can't help how I feel, I can't help my… my stories and there's nothing to be done about that. Now a lot of times when people have been betrayed, they want to do two things simultaneously. They want to reconcile on the one hand and they want to express their feelings on the other hand. And you know there are ways of expressing your feelings that can make reconciliation impossible. And I'm all in favor of people expressing their feelings. Some of my best friends do that. Stan does that all the time. Expressing his feelings all over the place. So but one of the things that we have to tell people is that, I understand you've been betrayed, and that you feel horrible in all that. If you want… if you want the possibility of reconciliation and I'm not pushing anybody to reconcile, I'm not pushing anybody to even want to reconcile. But if you have any idea that maybe you're going to want to reconcile, you're going to have to express your feelings in ways that make that possible. And a lot of people don't like hearing that, they say wait, wait, wait my wife cheated on me and I have to express myself in a nice way? And the answer is yes. You're still responsible for how you express yourself. And it's entirely possible to express rage and humiliation and everything that you want in a way that still makes it possible for reconciliation to happen. If that's what you want to do, if that's what you want to do. But the person who's been betrayed can damage the relationship in a lot of ways. The person who's, we're all familiar with the ways in which betrayal damages relationships I don't have to talk about that necessarily if I only have eight minutes but what are some of the ways that the betrayed can damage the relationship. How about telling everybody in the community because the kids have a right to know what kind of a sleazy person their father is or your boss has a right to know how unreliable you are in your marriage. That's just a horrible unforgivable behavior. Sorry Janice to use the word unforgivable, so promiscuously. The… the… the… the shaming… the shaming that goes on of the person who has been betrayed, the person who does they needs to take responsibility for that. I know that your parent broke the contract. That doesn't mean that now you get to pick up a gun, right. We all agree that doesn't mean you get to pick up a gun. The question is what do you get to do. Do you get to ruin your partner's career? Do you get to damage the children because you're so intent on shaming your partner who has betrayed you? If you want to become bitter go ahead but that's different than affecting the family and the community and so on. Am I out of time or I still have time for one more slide? 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN You have time for one more slide. 

00:19:25
MARTY KLEIN Great! We still have 40 minutes, that's great. I just want to say, so I want to say one more thing, new paragraph, I want to say one more thing. I get a lot of couples where and I live in Silicon Valley so you know everybody is like so tech savvy. Not me but everybody else. So I get a lot of couples where so Mary has had an affair and now her partner says, Okay so now, I want the password to all your e-mail accounts and I want the password your cell phone. I want to enable the GPS tracking device on your phone. I want to be able to call you at any time and just make sure I know where you are. And some people who have had a fear as they resist that. But a lot of people say, "yeah honey, whatever you say I'll do it. I mean, it's a drag but yeah honey I'll do it." I'm the one in those couples who steps in and says wait… wait… wait… wait let's talk about that. Let's talk about that. I think that all that tracking and all that following, following, following actually interferes with the development of trust, it doesn't build it, it interferes with it. Trust… trust is a belief in the absence of information. It's not if you have enough information, then you trust someone no, no, no. Trust is what you do when you don't have the information that you wish that you had. And… and monitoring somebody else's phone calls and e-mail and all that stuff may give somebody the illusion of security but it doesn't add to the trust and in fact, it prevents the development of the trust. And so what I like to do is to… to really encourage people to look at their desire to do that and maybe to say that might not be the best way to go about getting the sense of security that you wish that you had that temporarily you're going to have to do with out. So I think I might as well stop there. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN So do you guys want to have a discussion for a couple minutes? 

00:21:35
STAN TATKIN Yeah, I'd like to ask one question. Marty, are you… are you coming to my workshop today? 

00:21:40
MARTY KLEIN Is that an invitation or is that please don't come. 

00:21:45
STAN TATKIN Well, if you come just know no kissing. 

00:21:45
MARTY KLEIN No kissing? 

00:21:45
STAN TATKIN No kissing. 

00:21:45
MARTY KLEIN Oh, actually you and I are speaking at same time. Alex took care of that. 

00:21:55
STAN TATKIN It's interesting because there are some things that we see differently. But it has to be contextualized, otherwise it sounds like it's just different or opposite from you. I… I find that depending on the betrayal, depending on what happened there's… there's the reveal of information that should have been there all along that changes things. All right, and then there is… there are other kinds of betrayal like mismanagement of third's throwing, the person into the bus not protecting the partner from somebody else. But in terms of a unidirectional betrayal, where there's a reveal of important information that had I known this or you've known this, it could have changed a lot of things. In that instance there is at least in my experience, people who are the injured partner tend to show symptoms of PTSD. And this is something that in my experience they can't really do anything about. I'm not talking about acting badly or punishing their partner or you know, acting and behaving in a way that is not secure functioning, right. By going and telling everybody and ruining that person's life. No, that is not okay. But there is something to be reckoned with in terms of what happens to that person's mind and how they become preoccupied naturally with this new information trying to fit it into their… their experience right. How do I recalibrate my life now that I have this new information, I thought I was a duck and now I'm a dog. And… and I have to review my life in 360 in order to, in order to integrate that new information. And during that period that… that person's pretty messed up. I think that has to be dealt with in a certain way, in order for there to be any kind of healing and it puts the wrongdoer for lack of a better term in a position of having to hold that, right. To be both of the… the villain and the hero in being able to manage the… the mood instability, the flashbacks, the questions, the obsessions and so on without fighting back. And there is a problem not so much with… with the act, the betrayal itself its… it… it brings into question the problem of, I have evidence now that this person can lie. I have evidence that this person can lie not just once, not twice but in my face. And not only that I have evidence that this person can lead a life that's different than what I could predict. That creates a huge problem. There's a credibility issue that has to be resolved and worked through. And in that case there is I think a natural imbalance to the therapy if you have that unidirectional betrayal. That starts off imbalanced where there is a pay to play aspect. If you want it back in the relationship, how are you going to do that? You can't just say well, I can continue to be the gatekeeper of the information that comes out because I've proven to not be a reliable gatekeeper right. And that's where I think there is some perhaps it's not great but I get to see everything, should have been that way in the beginning. You should… I should see everything of yours, you should see everything of mine. If you believe that that is how the relationship ought to be structured to begin with and the betrayal then I think opens an opportunity to take the crisis, the pain that people are… are in and finally leverage that toward a secure functioning relationship where people are grownups, adults, transparent, being themselves and not hiding. But I think there is a certain imbalance in the beginning in terms of the person who's in the doghouse, being the wrongdoer that they are not in a great bargaining position. And they really probably should not be. 

00:26:10
ALEX KATEHAKIS I would agree that you have to take it on a case by case basis because everybody's so different and my experience with the people who are the, let's say the victims, the recipients they all come in… in an acute stress stage, if not having PTSD and these often tie to early unresolved traumas. So if this person is not securely attached to begin with their regulatory capacities are fragile to begin with. And so it's not just the infidelity that's activated them, it's historical. You've got untreated trauma let's say to begin with, fragile regulatory structures and then boom you've got this explosion on top of it. So people come in could look quite dis-regulated and they say and do all sorts of heinous and egregious things like you know, like Marty was saying wanting to call the office and out the person. I mean, it's outlandish and it's very destructive to the foundation of the relationship as he was saying as well. But I would agree with Stan that these you know, the trust has to be earned back slowly but surely because who I thought you were is not who you were at all and people do. And I have to say, its women who will throw the baby out with the bathwater that you are now completely invalid across the board. Nothing means anything and you're and I think that's in direct proportion to how badly somebody is hurting. It's not cortical, it's limbic that would be the best way to put it. It's vicious and its hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. So I think, Marty I would agree with you sort of in the later stages. I cant see him space, that once you know people come in… in this acute stress state once that starts to come down a bit then getting people to be reasonable and to treat each other well I think it's crucial if they want to repair. But sometimes in the early stages it's really difficult to peel somebody off someone who's hurt them so badly. 

00:28:15
MARTY KLEIN Well, Stan I… I… 

00:28:20
STAN TATKIN I have my own here. 

00:28:25
MARTY KLEIN I… I actually agree… agree with practically everything that you said. And Alex I, I'm glad that you feel that what I'm saying is more or less applicable to sort of the later stages. To start with what you just said, if we wait until the second stage when people cant think more clearly, more easily we may not get to the second stage because there may be so much damage that occurs until we get there. I'm very slow to say that somebody is so damaged that they have very little responsibility for their decisions. 

00:29:05
STAN TATKIN I agree. 

00:29:05
MARTY KLEIN Well, but… but you know when you talk about how destabilize people are, my patients are as destabilized as yours by affairs you know. When you talk about people are destabilized and you bring up PTSD depending on how you define PTSD, if we define that broadly enough, the concept loses most of its value, but okay. If… if we talk about people being that destabilized that they can't take responsibility for their response so egregious things that their partner has done that strips us of a lot of the power tools. And I'm very slow to do that, so I certainly talk as you know I only had a few minutes to do this. I certainly talk about the horrible experiences of the person has been betrayed of course, but if… if we emphasize too much, the uni directionality of the emotions you know, if we overlook the fact that the person who has gotten caught feels just as much shame, just as much humiliation, just as much collision with his own self image as the other person then where it makes the therapy so lopsided. It may help out the person in the short term who has been betrayed. And they need it but it may interfere with the longer term project of okay, what do you two want to about that. 

00:30:35
ALEX KATEHAKIS But I do think initially you have to lopsided because if we were in a marriage in an agreement and I cheat, I just disavowed our agreement. So in some ways I have… that part of agree with that but I have to be culpable for that. And if you're enraged and hurt, I have to be able to hear that. 

00:30:50
MARTY KLEIN Totally agree. Of course… of course. 

00:30:50
ALEX KATEHAKIS We can't just say no, we have to be at parity right now. 

00:30:55
MARTY KLEIN No, no, no. no, of course. 

00:30:55
ALEX KATEHAKIS I might have to throw some bad words at you and you might have to tolerate it for a short while and I agree, it's incredibly shaming of the people who already feel ashamed because of whatever their issues are that would have them do it to begin with. It's just super complicated and again it depends on the personalities in front of you. I mean, I've had women who you know, if I even side remotely with a male and talk about his trauma or his shame you know, walked out of my office. 

00:31:25
STAN TATKIN That's a wrong time. 

00:31:25
ALEX KATEHAKIS They… they're done. At the wrong… and it's usually in the first you know session or two. That's it. They really need to feel that somebody is on their side validating their rage and they're upset. 

00:31:35
MARTY KLEIN And… and you're right. That's a very delicate thing because the person who's walking in having been betrayed. 

00:31:45
ALEX KATEHAKIS Right. 

00:31:45
MARTY KLEIN They don't want to hear about the other person as a human being. 

00:31:50
ALEX KATEHAKIS No, right. Monster. 

00:31:50
MARTY KLEIN You said that… you said that the betrayer needs to be both a villain and a hero and that's true. To what extent does the betrayed also need to continue to see their partner who just did the worst thing in the world as this is still the person who has loved me dearly for 15 years. And this is still a human being. 

00:32:10
STAN TATKIN Here, hold on. Here is the promise that we're agreeing on, we're actually agreeing where there's differences here and this is where a little information can be a problem. Is that in no way you know, if a therapist is worth their salt and has an idea of what their frame is and has an idea what the rules of therapy are would allow either partner to do something that is self destructive. I mean going hand and… and doing a scorched earth thing is just plain self destructive. So we're not going to allow somebody to do that. We're not allowing somebody to do whatever they want because these things are also hurting the self, not just the other person. So again we're… we're… we're thinking about in a frame where there's a therapeutic alliance, where people are, we have an image in our mind in terms of what the stance is and where we want them to go and we hold them to that right. It's not the Wild West. Having said that, there is as you mentioned Alex, there is a built in sensitivity. I mean, the therapist working with betrayal issues has to be strategic, has to be skillful, has to be able to see the bigger board since the therapist generally, hopefully you're playing the long game they're playing the short game. You can see a bigger picture so you're being strategic in how you're sequencing these things out and who you're playing with here. With… with a greater goal in mind and that is to put this fucking thing together in a way it should have been to begin with, but never was. All right. You're using this… this opportunity because usually most of the betrayals that happened could have been predicted. Had you met with a couple early on you would been able to tell them one of them would have something like this because the way the relationship was structured to begin with. So it gives us an opportunity to build this thing correctly but it has to be done through an architecture, it has to be done with some kind of structure in mind, so that you're able to hold them in when they're going way off the rails. With the PTSD thing What I'm talking about is you know, John Lennon finds out that his aunt is his mother or Jack Nicholson his grandmother was his mother or somebody finds out they're actually very Jewish, come from a Jewish tradition but they've been Catholic the whole life. Any kind of information where it changes the game changes, it changes a sense of who one is and what we've been doing for the last 20 years occupies the mind. And there is mood instability there should be mood instability, flashbacks, sleep disturbances you know, separation, obsession very much in line with PTSD symptoms. So that's what I'm talking about if… if the person who's been injured doesn't show that, that's maybe one sign that things aren't what they seem. That you don't have this betrayal situation that you thought you had, that is just in one direction only. But I think, where I think we can all agree that… that skillfully you were going to play it the way it needs to be played as it presents in the office, as it presents… presents in the room and that nobody is going to allow people to act out and be destructive just because they are angry, just because they feel they've been hurt, right. That's not good therapy. It's subtle. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN I think a subtle thing underneath what you're all talking about is the stance of the therapist. And you know, depending on your own counter transference and also depending on your view, you're going to take a very different stance if you know, if you've got somebody who's lied with a lot of gas lighting, a lot of felony lies you know, you know, how much you're going to confront or manage that person (inaudible) the other. Everything isn't going to be equal in the room. 

00:36:00
STAN TATKIN We are the standard bearers of reality. If somebody starts to go off and say well, you were never you know across the board you never loved me, and you were never this and you were never that and the kids, all that stuff, that's not in reality. And that has to be confronted. If somebody does that right. So again, like you said this is all falls within the therapist's orientation, their frame, what they're going for their narrative, and those are the rules that the therapist is using to determine when I step in and when I let it go. 

00:36:30
ALEX KATEHAKIS Right. And if the therapist has a judgment about infidelity or they can't see they are not compassionate enough about the abject pain that the person who made that move has suffered for so long, not… not necessarily one affair but if it's been multiple endless streams of people. I had a patient once who had sex with over a thousand people that his wife discovered on the internet. I mean, that's really painful but he had some very serious issues that she never knew about when she married him. 

00:37:05
MARTY KLEIN A thousand? 

00:37:05
ALEX KATEHAKIS Only a couple of years. 

00:37:05
MARTY KLEIN … 75 years old. 

00:37:05
ALEX KATEHAKIS No, no. 

00:37:05
MARTY KLEIN If somebody… if somebody has a thousand… sex with a thousand people I think that's easier for their husband or wife than if they have sex with one or two people. I mean clearly anybody who has sex with a thousand people, they're unemployed I suppose. 

00:37:20
ALEX KATEHAKIS No he wasn't actually. He wasn't. He was having sex with men, so it was in and out. It was super quick. 

00:37:30
MARTY KLEIN Right. I mean… 

00:37:30
ALEX KATEHAKIS That's how he… 

00:37:30
STAN TATKIN That's how he did it. 

00:37:30
ALEX KATEHAKIS That's how he did it. He said, he'd open the door, they dropped trou, they do their thing, and he was out. 

00:37:35
MARTY KLEIN I mean, theoretically the spouse would be able to say there's something going on here that has nothing to do with me. 

00:37:40
ALEX KATEHAKIS It was still painful for her. 

00:37:40
MARTY KLEIN Of course. 

00:37:45
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yeah, yeah. And she was smart enough to figure that out, like what's going on. Our first question of course was are you gay and it did come out later that he was much more oriented towards men than women as evidenced by the 1000 penises. 

00:38:00
STAN TATKIN So what's going to be the big problem for us, it's going to be the counter transference. 

00:38:00
ALEX KATEHAKIS Correct. I think, that's what I want to say. 

00:38:05
STAN TATKIN And… and that's… that is the thing that hangs us in the end, if anything does it's our biases get in the way, our counter transference gets in the way projective identification isn't understood and this is mishandled. That's going to be the danger because betrayal happens probably everybody in this room has felt in one way or the other, betrayed or lied to or cheated on or you did cheat yourself. So it's when I talking about something that's that unusual and the chances of you being stimulated or upset or somehow biased in the room are what 90, some percent 

00:38:40
ALEX KATEHAKIS High. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN And I think another thing that happens a lot is that therapist come out of school with all this focus on you have to treat everybody equally. And what if you're in a situation, where you actually are not going to treat everybody equally in the beginning the way Alex was alluding to then how much does that stir up in the therapist? 

00:39:00
STAN TATKIN If the therapist is not able to scaffold both the wrongdoer, again lack of you know, it not a great term. 

00:39:05
MARTY KLEIN Evil doer. 

00:39:10
STAN TATKIN Evil doer, the betrayer the fuckface, whatever. You know, if that person can't be understood and empathized with and scaffolded then the therapy is going to crash anyway. So the therapist has to be balanced in and in understanding that these two people are going to be in and should stay in… Bless you… sufficient pain in order for them to learn something. But the pain is a little different. I mean the stress you're dealing with and the reasons they'd want to jump out of this thing would be different. But it has to be acknowledged that you may not want to do this and nobody would blame you for not wanting to do this, either of you, right but for different reasons, right. 

00:39:50
ALEX KATEHAKIS Umm… you know I have to be able to regulate, we have to be able to regulate ourselves and watch our judgments and it's interesting, I also tracking myself and looking at how much these people really love each other because some people don't you know, and those… their prognosis is not good if they don't. If they do, they really have a fighting chance and they get past this point of heat I think. 

00:40:15
MARTY KLEIN I… most of the couples I see, where there's infidelity they say that they love each other. I don't think that's the most important thing. I think the most important thing is do their values coincide and do they have the same vision of what kind of relationship they want to have. 

00:40:30
ALEX KATEHAKIS Oh, sure. 

00:40:30
MARTY KLEIN Because if one person wants a house full of children and fun and visitors, and the other person wants a more quiet contemplate a kind of home. I don't care how much they love each other they're going to spend the next 20 years pushing and shoving what kind of relationship we going to have. 

00:40:45
ALEX KATEHAKIS Sure. 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN You guys open up to the audience? 

00:40:50
ALEX KATEHAKIS What's that? 

00:40:50
STAN TATKIN Sure. 

00:40:50
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yeah, definitely. 

00:40:50
MARTY KLEIN I want Stab to talk some more. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN So if you guys have questions go ahead and go to the mike. Oh, oops! 

00:41:00
ALEX KATEHAKIS I think… 

00:41:05
STAN TATKIN It's the pretend kind, you talk loud, use your stage voice. 

00:41:10
MARTY KLEIN That's right. 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Is this on? 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Okay. All right, your question is? 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN So I want to go right into the therapeutic stance and the counter transference and where this is getting me. So the big question I have is how do I cope ethically with the science that it's emotionally intelligent to be a good liar. Please, help me with this. I'm serious. 

00:41:45
STAN TATKIN How to cope with it? 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Please, seriously. 

00:41:45
MARTY KLEIN All right, that's just a subset about all of the things that we know about people. It's not only… it's not only socially intelligent to be a good liar, it's socially intelligent to want to be with a mate who looks the normative definition of attractive, it's socially intelligent to want to be with somebody who can pick up the check. So which means you know have friends who are not therapists so. So… we… None of us… none of us has the patience we… the patients who we deserve. You know, we all have these patients who are not nearly as good people as we would like them to be because nobody is that good you know, so whether it's the fact that we have patients who are liars. I'm in Silicon Valley so I have a lot of… a lot of engineers, who don't know a feeling from a pineapple. I have… I have a certain number of people in my practice who are usually high executives at the high tech companies. They make 40 50 million dollars a year and they say that their marriage and their family is the most important thing to them and they're never home. So all of this is just the, to me it's… it's the profile of the imperfect species that happens to form the human race that walks through that door. 

00:43:10
STAN TATKIN Perfectly imperfect. 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN Do you have other? 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Yeah Marty, I… I like what you said about you know that trying to restore trust doesn't mean you… you always trying to investigate. How… briefly how would you go about restoring or helping somebody restore trust if they're the betrayed party? 

00:43:35
MARTY KLEIN That's a great question. And… and I have two answers. How do… how do I help people restore trust. One is I have no idea how that works out. But I say that seriously because we all have couples where they come in and you think to yourself, I know how this is going to work out. And hopefully, most of the time we're right but whether it's one way or another. But there are times when I think this theory these people are never going to reconcile and they do. I think, spending time together where people are enjoying each other's company and remembering why did I want to be with this person in the first place. And I think that's important. Janice, you know had a real nice formulation this morning about how I don't want an apology, I want you… I want to know that you're apologizing for what's really important to me and that you really mean it. And… and my question when people are too quick to accept an apology, my question is presumably this person was trying to be faithful before and presumably this person loved you before. So why… why should anyone believe you when you say that you're going to be different next time. So I think that that's one way that the betrayed can hold the betrayer responsible, which is what kind of change process are you going to go through, whether it's are you going to find Jesus or are you going to have a near death experience or are you going to go into the desert for a week without food and water and hallucinate, where you're going to be in therapy for a while. What change process are you going to go through. Because unless you go through a change process why should I believe that you're going to… to handle the same feelings that you have or the same logistical situation differently next time. And I think that person reporting to the betrayed the progress of that process, I think that helps build trust. 

00:45:30
STAN TATKIN So just to add on to what you're saying because I agree totally. It is something that can't be done now. 

00:45:35
MARTY KLEIN It can't be done now. 

00:45:40
STAN TATKIN It can't be done now. It is… it is time. You know, it's time. And… and there is a measure, there is some kind of criteria that isn't really stated. It isn't certainly a diamond ring or a new car that you give your partner that you after cheating, right. As some celebrities have done. It is… it is a demonstration that there is a see change. I mean there's some demonstration that I'm a better person. I no longer… 

00:46:05
MARTY KLEIN A different person in short. 

00:46:05
STAN TATKIN A different person but a better person. 

00:46:05
MARTY KLEIN Okay. 

00:46:10
STAN TATKIN I mean I can hold the idea that I'm a liar and a cheater. I don't try to get rid of it. I'll wear the scarlet letter. I'll gladly do it because I'm now the poster child for lying and cheating. I understand… I understand what I lost. And that's an important factor here that there should be a recognition that there's a lot that can't be regained. And then through that I become a better person, I own that. But that takes a long time and people are not going to do that for a while. 

00:46:35
MARTY KLEIN And… and here's a metaphor that you can use if you like. If… if we had a stack of 10 bricks over here and we wanted to move them over there, each one of those ten bricks would take 10 percent of the effort and at any given moment we could measure exactly what percentage of the job we had finished. We don't know how long it's going to take to rebuild trust. And we also know that each hour of that process does not contribute equally to the finished job. So for some people who say the equivalent of "Look I stopped doing it and I'm never going to do it again." When does the trust start to say to them "Well, actually this is going to ramp up." And at the beginning you may not see any evidence of the trust coming back. People get impatient about that. But we have to explain that you have to as you say play the long game, you have to realize that this is going to be a ramp up. If there is one tiny little thing that somebody can do every once in a while to validate, "yeah, I don't trust you yet but I could even imagine that maybe I'm gonna." That's helpful. 

00:47:40
STAN TATKIN I think it's much easier. I'm so sorry. I think it's easier to notice the things that people will do that will get in the way of building trust. That's an easier thing and easier… easier measure is to notice what people are do that will slow that process. 

00:47:55
ALEX KATEHAKIS Right, it's what people do not what they say, but I think empathy from the betrayer to the betrayed is a major part of the rebuilding of trust. 

00:48:00
STAN TATKIN Sure. 

00:48:05
ALEX KATEHAKIS Rather than getting defensive and saying why are you yelling again or you're so edgy, even though that's the natural inclination is to say "wow! I really get why you're so upset right now, I see how badly I hurt you." That goes a long, long way especially with females. But… but I agree, it takes a long time, it's slow and it's about action 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN I think another big factor when you're rebuilding trust is do you answer questions I ask you. 

00:48:30
ALEX KATEHAKIS Transparency, vulnerability. 

00:48:35
MARTY KLEIN But… but not every question is a legitimate question. The pain is legitimate but when someone says "Okay, you had an affair and I want to know the name of every restaurant that you took him to." I don't think that's a good question to answer. I've never seen anybody use that information in a wholesome way. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Okay. But there's a big difference if I'm the person getting that question and I say to you "you know what, I used to feel like I had the answer every single thing you asked me. I don't feel like I have to answer everything, so I'm not going to answer it." Rather than the prevaricating and driving (ph) that goes on…. 

00:49:10
MARTY KLEIN Well, of course the prevaricating, that's no good. I think the ideal answer to that is "sweetheart, exactly what is it that you want to know right now or sweetheart exactly what is it that you want to feel right now?" Because the answer of, let me give you a list of restaurants where we went. Or let me give you a list of the songs that we listened to while we have sex since that's what you're asking for. Rather than give you a list honey what is it that you want to feel right now. Maybe there's a better way to help you feel that way. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN Well, you know the partner who sits in our office and says that I love them, I hope they show up 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN Can I just ask the question? 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN I just heard opinions of… Hopefully can hear me… of the situation a couple in my office, the wife had the affair, so they are planning on telling the… I encourage them to tell the husband that she had the affair with. They're cutting it off. They don't want to continue they're going to rebuild their marriage. And so the couple now wants to tell the wife of the guy that she had the affair with so that they can kind of revenge and get even and that type of thing. Just curious if…. 

00:50:25
MARTY KLEIN B has an affair, A finds out about it and now the couple is thinking Should we tell the partner of the person you had an affair with. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, so that she's aware of the affair going on as well. 

00:50:35
MARTY KLEIN And why do we want this? 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Right, what would that do? 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN I don't encourage it but they… 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Revenge. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN … think if everyone should, she should… she deserves to know is their philosophy. 

00:50:40
MARTY KLEIN Oh, what a bunch of crap! 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN I don't encourage that. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Are these couples… are these couples friends? They're friends, yeah. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN so the foursome is the… are friends. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN So they are friends, there is that piece too. I. I personally think they should just cut off the affair and they'll have to leave it up to that couple. 

00:50:55
STAN TATKIN Agreed. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN But they said she has a right to know. I'm just curious of your opinion. 

00:51:00
MARTY KLEIN Well, I already expressed my opinion 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Yes, u did. Thank you. 

00:51:05
MARTY KLEIN To put it in a more sophisticated way perhaps. 

00:51:10
ALEX KATEHAKIS I think… I think there's a lot of self-righteousness in that. That it's really not their position. If the man who was cheating with the woman, who wants to come clean to his wife, that's their marriage and their business. But these others are acting as vigilantes. And it's a weird it's almost like they're bonding together. They can be angry at that instead of really dealing with what's going on be between them. 

00:51:30
MARTY KLEIN They found something to bond with. 

00:51:35
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yeah, yes. 

00:51:35
MARTY KLEIN There is a pragmatic aspect to your particular case which is that the four people are friends. 

00:51:40
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yes. 

00:51:40
MARTY KLEIN So it may be… it may be you know… 

00:51:40
ALEX KATEHAKIS They can't be friends anymore maybe. 

00:51:45
MARTY KLEIN Well… well, so it may be that the couple says to the person with whom they had the affair. Look we don't see ourselves going out to dinner with you two at least you know, for the next 100 years. Now… now, your partner is going to say "How come we don't see John and Mary anymore?" We don't want to be the ones to tell your partner why we don't want to see the two of you anymore. What do you want to do about that? Because that question is going to come up. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Right, right. Thank you so much for reaffirming my thoughts. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN Okay, let's do two quick ones, you got about three minutes left. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN So I'm wondering from the perspective of what they call the imago (ph) match where two people come together by magic using their massive computer between their ears. And if that's so if you accept that maybe there is some… something going on besides just being in love like drunk for a moment. If there's some measure of magic then to what extent when someone has an affair is there a magic of wait a minute we didn't pay attention to it, this is like a brick getting hit over the head and we have to… we have to follow through why we got together. And what do they have to do? How much is enough and how much is… Now this is a surface thing you had an affair, you're… I mean a lot of people come in they say if you have an affair I'm out of there. That's… that's the end of the conversation. So I'm wondering what you guys think in terms of what work needs to be done. And if there is such a thing as two people coming together to help each other on a very deep level further then yeah we were just in love so we got married. 

00:53:40
ALEX KATEHAKIS Are you talking about the affair partners having imago experience that was necessary for them? 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN If people… I'm just using imago as a point of reference, they call that an imago match. If that makes sense to you guys then to what extent has this supercomputer selected two people, Who…. when something comes up they… they have to follow through and deal with it in a different way than maybe if you're just dating. 

00:54:15
STAN TATKIN I don't know why I'm having a hard time tracking the question. 

00:54:20
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yeah, right. 

00:54:20
STAN TATKIN I understand all the parts, I just can't get the gist of what you're asking. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Okay, I'm just wondering… 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Let's take the other question and then if he wants to come up and… 

00:54:25
ALEX KATEHAKIS Okay. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Quickly. There's a person still behind you. So let's take the other one since we are out of time and then… 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN I was just… I was just wanting you to comment on something that I've seen in a few of the couples that I've treated which is that, I've been working with them on issues of distancing from each other, control issues whatever the issues are in the marriage and then an affair comes out and it seems to me that, that motivates people. And I will say positive way that the affair actually brings to a head the issues so that the people are much more motivated to take a deeper look at it. 

00:55:05
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yeah. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN And so I have… at certain points I have to be very delicate because we're talking here about people's feelings of being betrayed but to be able to introduce the idea that this is actually a positive element in terms of working forward and deeper issues. I'm wondering if you could comment on that. 

00:55:20
ALEX KATEHAKIS Well, I find that couples come to that themselves because there was all this deception you know, implicit agreements not explicit ways of being with each other and an affair or multiple affairs just blows the top off the whole thing. And I've had couples who stayed in treatment three, five years said this was the best thing that ever happened to us. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:55:45
ALEX KATEHAKIS Our marriage is more you know honest than it's ever been before and it's more sexually interesting. So it's not the worst thing. Sometimes it can be the silver lining. 

00:55:55
STAN TATKIN I agree. I am… I'm not happy to see people who are unhappy… 

00:56:00
ALEX KATEHAKIS Suffer. 

00:56:00
STAN TATKIN …suffer, but you know, I mean how many of us see couples umm… how many of them have had affairs or coming in because of an affair or some kind of lie. The greater the drama the more suffering there is, in my mind that works better for us. And if it works better for us it works better for them. We can leverage that, we can use that in ways you can't when people are not suffering. I mean pain is our… is what's in this for, if the couple are partners are not in pain we we've got nothing. And so you have a crisis like this, it's really an opportunity if you're skillful to turn this into something that it couldn't have been without the crisis. 

00:56:50
MARTY KLEIN That's why we say a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. 

00:56:50
ALEX KATEHAKIS Yeah, nice.
