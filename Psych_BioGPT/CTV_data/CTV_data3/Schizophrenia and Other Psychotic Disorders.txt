DIAGNOSING MENTAL DISORDERS 

00:00:00
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 

00:00:05
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS 

00:00:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Mental disorders that fall along the schizophrenia spectrum are often misunderstood or misrepresented in popular culture. Film and literature can sometimes portray individuals with schizophrenia as dangerous, sadistic, and out of control. And can even perpetuate the misconception that they suffer from multiple personality disorder. In fact, a 2008 study by the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that 64 percent of the general public thought that split or multiple personalities were symptoms of schizophrenia, while only 24 percent considered themselves familiar with the illness. 

00:00:50
DAVID SANTANA Umm… I, I feel… Shut up. Hey! 

00:00:55
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN No, listen. Listen, baby… 

00:00:55
DAVID SANTANA Hey! 

00:01:00
SEAN HARRIGAN The truth is that schizophrenia presents with a range of symptoms. Studies have shown that while some people diagnosed with schizophrenia can be violent, most patients with schizophrenia are at no greater risk of violence than the general population. In fact, patients with schizophrenia are far more likely to be the victims of violence than they are to act out violently against others. Unlike, what is portrayed in some movies, the symptoms of schizophrenia do not involve multiple personalities or features similar to dissociative identity disorder. One of the dissociative disorders, we'll mention in another program in which the person experiences two or more distinct identities. As advocates for patients, it is the job of health care providers to correct these types of misconceptions. Therefore, it is especially important for healthcare providers to be familiar with the characteristics and symptomatology of schizophrenia. And to separate the myth from the fact. 

00:02:00
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:02:05
DSM-5® 

00:02:05
SEAN HARRIGAN The schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders grouping also known as schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5 contains a number of distinct disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. These codes cross walk to the codes used by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with the codes from ICD-10 listed in parentheses. For instance, Schizotypal personality disorder is a sign the code 301.22 from ICD-9 and F21 in parentheses from ICD-10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use in the United States when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was adopted in the US in the fall of 2015. However, because ICD-10 was implemented in 2015, this program will be listing the newer code from the ICD-10 first followed by the ICD-9 codes in parentheses. Sometimes when relevant, we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes when we mention the disorder from one of the other chapters of DSM-5. For example, dissociative identity disorder mentioned earlier in this program is coded as F44.81 (300.14), part of the F40-F48 section of ICD-10 on Neurotic, Stress-Related and Somatoform disorders. Organizationally, F20-F29, the ICD-10's block on schizophrenia, schizoptypal and delusional disorders is organized similarly to the DSM-5 chapter on Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic spectrum disorders. The main exceptions to this pertain to Substance or Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorders and Psychotic Disorders due to Another Medical Condition. The ICD-10 puts what they call Mental and Behavioral Disorders Due To Psychoactive Substance Abuse in the F10 block. And Organic, including Symptomatic Mental Disorders in F00-F09, specifically F06 or Other Mental Disorders Due To Brain Damage And Dysfunction and To Physical Disease. In this case, the code is F06.0 for Organic Hallucinosis, and F06.2 for Organic Delusional Schizophrenia-Like Disorder. Notice that this organization in terminology is somewhat different from the verbiage and structure contained in DSM-5. It is also important to mention Schizotypal Personality Disorder here. As the ICD-10 does label it in this section and it is considered to be part of the schizophrenia spectrum. However, like DSM-5 we group it with other personality disorders and will save it for our concurrent program on those disorders. 

00:05:20
PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS 

00:05:25
DAVID SANTANA Umm… 

00:05:25
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN What? 

00:05:25
DAVID SANTANA I mean, this thing is like, it's shaking, like this could fall easily. 

00:05:30
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN (inaudible ). 

00:05:35
DAVID SANTANA But the cabinets, the cabinets, you know, in an earthquake, I mean, all that it's gonna fall. 

00:05:35
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN I mean, if there's an earthquake, we're not gonna stand next to the cabinet. 

00:05:40
SEAN HARRIGAN There are five broad categories that can be seen for symptoms of Psychosis, Delusions, Hallucinations, Disorganized Speech, Abnormal behavior, and Negative symptoms. Understanding these features is essential to being able to diagnose psychosis in it's many forms. A delusion is a fixed false belief that is resistant to reason or confrontation with actual fact. These delusions can manifest in various themes. For example, persecutory delusions where the individual feels they are being threatened or pursued by other individuals or groups of individuals or nihilistic delusions, where the individual feels something disastrous is going to happen. 

00:06:25
DAVID SANTANA And maybe, I mean, I don't like… Umm… I mean, this thing is like it's shaking. Like this could fall easily. 

00:06:35
SEAN HARRIGAN It can be hard to distinguish delusions from strongly held beliefs or overvalued ideas. The distinction partially depends on how strong the belief is held. A person with a delusion is unable to entertain the possibility they may be wrong, despite evidence that the contrary. In other words, the delusional patient cannot reality test. In addition, the delusional belief is not widely accepted by their culture or subculture. 

00:07:05
DAVID SANTANA No, no. Umm… Do we have? Umm… Are you hiding somebody in… 

00:07:10
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN Am I hiding somebody? 

00:07:15
DAVID SANTANA Yeah. Or, or is that window open? 

00:07:15
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN No, window is closed. 

00:07:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Hallucinations entail sensory experiences that happen without external sensory stimulus. They can occur across any of the five senses, though auditory hallucinations are the most typical, often manifesting themselves in the form of voices. Visual hallucinations are less common with schizophrenia and could be a sign that another medical or neurological condition is causing or contributing to the symptoms. The person must be fully conscious and alert for the hallucinations to be a marker of psychosis. These are distinct from illusions in which normal perceptions are misinterpreted. 

00:07:55
MARISSA MOOSEKIAN What's going on? 

00:07:55
DAVID SANTANA Wow, friends, umm… umm… umm… That, umm… What was it? Umm… the onions, friends and onions. 

00:08:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Disorganized thinking is often observed in a patient's speech pattern. This may entail derailment or loose associations where the speech doesn't seem to follow logical patterns. This disorganization could become so pronounced that it becomes incoherent. Though that level of disorganized speech is rare, the symptoms must nonetheless result in functional impairment in order to be considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. The abnormal behaviors of schizophrenia and its related disorders can manifest in everything from a logical behavior that doesn't appear goal oriented to catatonia. Catatonia can involve mutism and waxy flexibility, where the person can hold postures for hours. On the contrary, catatonia can also involve stupor or purposeless behavior. However catatonia can occur as part of a number of psychiatric and general medical conditions. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia result in more functional impairment than the positive over the course of the illness and our characteristic of schizophrenia that is not typically seen with other psychiatric disorders. This could be more limited emotional expression or a lack of motivation to do things. 

00:09:35
THE SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM 

00:09:40
SEAN HARRIGAN The diagnosis for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders depends on a number of factors, including the number of symptoms, their severity, their duration and how many of the previously mentioned broad categories of psychotic symptoms the patient fulfils. The disorders can be thought to be cover a continuum of symptomatology, which is the reason DSM-5 calls it a spectrum of disorders. 

00:10:05
BRETT DUGGAN And where you've gone. 

00:10:05
JIM HARRIGAN Quite inside, I have a terrific inside. Sure, what a woman is thinking and this? I'm, I mean, look at me, you know. So in fact, I have this great plan, work out? I, I have a what is wired bicycles do people, you know, by the… 

00:10:25
SEAN HARRIGAN In the case of delusional disorder, patients must display prominent delusions without disorganized thoughts or behaviors. And hallucinations can only occur in the context of delusions. This is a change from DSM-4TR which limited delusional disorder to non bizarre delusions and did not account for patients with delusional disorder experiencing hallucinations. While delusional disorder presents with a constellation of symptoms that are different from schizophrenia, there are other disorders included in this chapter that are more similar to schizophrenia in terms of symptomatology but differ from schizophrenia, in terms of time course. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the same symptoms of schizophrenia, but remits before one month. Each of the disorders mentioned has some overlap with the other psychotic disorders. When making a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is not only important to rule out other disorders that present with constellations of psychotic symptoms, but to rule out general medical and neurologic conditions that could explain the symptoms the patient is experiencing. 

00:11:35
SCHIZOPHRENIA 

00:11:40
SEAN HARRIGAN We will begin our review with schizophrenia. Though this is different organizationally from the layout of DSM-5, we find that learners are better able to understand the other disorders from the grouping, when they have an understanding of schizophrenia. 

00:11:55
SCHIZOPHRENIA 

00:11:55
FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS 

00:12:00
SEAN HARRIGAN An individual with schizophrenia will have delusions, hallucinations and or disorganized speech, though they may also have the abnormal behaviors or negative symptoms that we outlined previously. These symptoms will be active for a significant amount of a one month period, though less acute signs of the disorder will be continuous over a six month period. However, the active symptoms maybe present for a period of less than one month, if treatment has been successful. This will cause a significant decrease in the individual's level of functioning in more than one major area of the individual's life, such as their work or personal life as compared to before the onset of the condition. This is apparent in children and adolescents when they fail to meet expected gains in school, self-care and global functioning. 

00:13:00
SCHIZOPHRENIA 

00:13:00
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS 

00:13:05
SEAN HARRIGAN In order to make a diagnosis, other diagnoses must be ruled out, including a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, schizophrenia induced by another medical condition, or autism. Along these lines, clinicians must screen for current and past manic or depressive episodes. And understand the chronologic relationship between these episodes and psychotic symptomatology. Manic or depressive symptoms do not rule out a diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, depending on their duration during the course of the illness or their presence during the active symptoms of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or a mood disorder with psychotic features may warn consideration. Obsessive compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder can also have a delusional component, although such delusions manifest themselves in the context of the patient's usual obsessions. The specifier with delusional beliefs is a new addition to the DSM-5 criteria for OCD that did not appear in DSM-4 TR. On the flip side, some investigators have reported that subsets of patients with schizophrenia present with obsessive compulsive symptoms in addition to the core symptoms of schizophrenia. The differentiation between OCD and schizophrenia can sometimes be challenging clinically. Posttraumatic stress disorder can also present with hallucinatory flashbacks, although, these are associated with the re-experiencing of a traumatic event. And if the full symptoms or duration of schizophrenia haven't been met, the clinician should look to one of the other psychotic disorders covered in more detail throughout this program. 

00:14:55
SCHIZOPHRENIA 

00:14:55
SPECIFIERS 

00:15:00
SEAN HARRIGAN There are numerous core specifiers to consider when diagnosing schizophrenia, especially if the condition has lasted for more than one year. These involve describing if the patient has experienced or is experiencing their first episode of psychotic symptoms or if they have had multiple episodes. Further, the core specifiers also record, if the patient is currently experiencing an acute episode or is instead currently having a partial or full remission of symptoms. So if a patient is currently experiencing their first episode that meets the characteristics for schizophrenia, the specifier would be first episode currently an acute episode. In addition, other alternative specifiers in this category, could be continuous or unspecified. The previous specifiers that outlined subtypes of schizophrenia such as the paranoid subtype were eliminated in DSM-5. It should also be specified if the patient is experiencing schizophrenia with catatonia. Although it is important to note that catatonia can occur as part of a range of psychiatric disorders and general medical conditions. DSM also allows clinicians the options of specifying symptom severity. 

00:16:20
SCHIZOPHRENIA 

00:16:20
OTHER CHARACTERISTICS 

00:16:25
SEAN HARRIGAN There are a number of other features that are also present with schizophrenia. The individual may experience cognitive deficits affecting memory, language function, sensory processing and social skills. They may experience difficulty sleeping, staying up and awakening late, especially with the incidents of delusions or hallucinations. Phobias and anxiety are also typical. They can display increased dysphoria and hostility,especially in younger males or those individuals with a history of violent behavior. Substance abuse can also increase the likelihood of violence in patients with schizophrenia. However, the substance that people with schizophrenia use most is nicotine. 80 percent of patients with schizophrenia in the United States smoke. Though that data is slightly different in other countries. As with most mental illnesses, some individuals display a lack of insight or general lack of awareness of the symptoms they are demonstrating. Such patients may not believe, they're experiencing anything unusual or abnormal, or may have delusional beliefs regarding the core symptoms of the illness such as hallucination. This can become a cause for concern, when a patient with schizophrenia lacks insight and becomes non adherent with treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia most commonly began in a person's late teens to mid 30s. Symptoms sometimes manifest themselves prior to this, although early onset schizophrenia is thought to be rare. The onset of symptoms usually happens gradually, but can sometimes occur abruptly. In addition, males often show symptoms earlier in life than females. The majority of individuals will experience symptoms of schizophrenia for life. Though with treatment, they can often live independently in the community and perhaps become employed. 

00:18:20
SCHIZOPHRENIFORM 

00:18:20
DISORDER 

00:18:25
SEAN HARRIGAN The primary difference between schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia is the duration of time an individual is ill. In schizophreniform disorder, the duration is between one month and six months, though the required symptoms remain the same. A percentage of patients diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder will go on to develop a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The need to categorize schizophreniform disorder can be attributed to the fact that individuals who are ill for only a short period of time, have a greater chance of recovery than those who experience symptoms for more than six months. Clinicians should not give a diagnosis of schizophrenia, until a patient has demonstrated the appropriate symptoms for a period of six months or more. Over 50 percent of patients with this disorder will eventually be diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 

00:19:25
BRIEF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER 

00:19:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Similarly, brief psychotic disorder differs from both schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder, and that it describes symptoms that last between one day and one month. It is also separate from the other two disorders and that negative symptoms aren't one of the markers of diagnosis. This is because brief psychotic disorder is a short and possibly self limited disorder, while negative symptoms are typically associated with chronicity of illness. While brief psychotic disorder is a rare diagnosis, especially in the United States, it can sometimes be given for psychotic symptoms that occur during pregnancy or within four weeks of giving birth. In this case the specifier with post-partum onset would be given. Viewers should note that in previous versions of the DSM, brief psychotic disorder was known as brief reactive psychosis, implying that the patient was reacting to some type of stress. Along these lines, brief psychotic disorder can be diagnosed with the specifier with marked stressors. If the onset of symptoms occurs after events, they would be markedly stressful to almost anyone experiencing the same circumstances within the same culture. If this is not the case, the specifier without mark stressors can be given. 

00:20:50
DELUSIONAL DISORDER 

00:20:55
JIM HARRIGAN I'm ready. I'm rock to roll. 

00:21:00
BRETT DUGGAN Well, what are you doing, dad? 

00:21:00
JIM HARRIGAN Well, this is my tandem bike. 

00:21:00
BRETT DUGGAN Mh-mm? 

00:21:05
JIM HARRIGAN And then I'm gonna be going with the little lady down the street that probably, madly love me. 

00:21:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Delusional disorder describes the presence of delusions without the presence of the other four broad categories of symptoms for schizophrenia. DSM-5 no longer requires that the delusions associated with delusional disorder be non-bizarre in nature. In fact, DSM-5 recognizes that patients with delusional disorder may experience hallucinations. Although, such hallucinations must be in the context of the patients usual delusions. Part of what makes delusional disorder unique from Schizophrenia is the lack of disorganization and negative symptoms. In fact, it may be difficult to tease out psychotic symptoms when interviewing patients with delusional disorder. Despite this presentation, delusional disorder patients are at risk for acts of violence because of the presence of jealous or persecutory delusions. It is important to ensure that the symptoms aren't better explained by the effects of a substance, another medical condition or another mental disorder. If delusional symptoms or schizophrenia symptoms are induced by a substance, a diagnosis of substance/medication induced psychotic disorder maybe more appropriate. If the disorder is induced by another medical condition than psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is the appropriate diagnosis. Also as mentioned previously, the delusional beliefs are not better accounted by body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder. Similarly, any possible manic or major depressive symptoms have been brief part of the overall course of the disorder. There are numerous core specifiers for delusional disorder. The clinician should specify if the delusions present with any of the themes mentioned previously. In addition to the persecutory type of delusional disorder, there is the erotomanic type, the grandiose type, the jealous type and the somatic type, where the delusions are focused on bodily functions. The somatic type of delusional disorder often needs to be differentiated from illness anxiety disorder or other somatic symptom and related disorders. Clinicians can also diagnose the mixed type or the unspecified type of delusional disorder. The clinician can also specify if the delusion occurs with bizarre content, if the delusions are implausible or fantastic in nature. And just as with schizophrenia, it can be specified if the delusional disorder is a first episode or one of multiple. In addition, there are specifiers indicating if a delusional disorder is acute, in partial remission, or in full remission. 

00:23:55
SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER 

00:24:00
SEAN HARRIGAN Schizoaffective disorder could be characterized as fitting somewhere in between schizophrenia and a mood disorder. In fact, the prognosis of schizoaffective disorder also lies in between the prognosis for schizophrenia and a mood disorder. This entails either hallucinations or delusions that are present for two or more weeks without the appearance of any mood episodes. This can be at anytime during the lifetime of the illness. However, there also must be an uninterrupted period where a major mood episode either depressive or manic happens at the same time as the active psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. And this mood episode happens for the majority of the full duration of the illness. It should be specified whether a schizoaffective disorder is bipolar type or depressive type. The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is not without controversy. And some experts have called it confusing or a wastebasket diagnosis. Even William Carpenter, chairperson of the DSM-5 psychosis study group has stated, "We don't even know if it exists in nature." However, the illness essentially boils down to mood symptoms that must be present during the majority of the illness and psychotic symptoms that are present on their own for at least two weeks. 

00:25:25
JENNIFER SHAEVITZ No, I don't want to. 

00:25:30
SEAN HARRIGAN Well, symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations may appear obvious. Separating out the nuances of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders can be challenging. Because of the durational element of these conditions, a proper diagnosis requires collecting a careful history and chronology of events. This often requires information from more than just the patient. And it means that caretakers and family members are often sought out to provide collateral information. Understanding the distinctions between these illnesses is crucial to determining the best course of treatment for patients and helping them lead more productive lives.
