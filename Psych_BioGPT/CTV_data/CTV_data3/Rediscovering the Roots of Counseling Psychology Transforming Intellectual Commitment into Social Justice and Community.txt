MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 www.emicrotraining.com Presents 2006 Winter Roundtable Teachers College, Columbia University Saturday, February 18th Rediscovering the Roots of Counseling Psychology: Transforming Intellectual Commitment into Social Justice and Community Thomas Parham University of California-Irvine 

00:00:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Let me say good afternoon. 

00:00:35
 Good afternoon. 

00:00:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Let me try that again, good afternoon to the rest of you. 

00:00:40
 Good afternoon. 

00:00:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It is ah, my pleasure to be here. For those of you who have not had the privilege to meet, I'm Dr. Thomas Parham. I'm ah, Assistant Vice Chancellor at the University of California-Irvine. And I wanna thank ah, Dr. Constantine and the organizers of the Roundtable for an opportunity and an invitation to address you today. Isn't it always nice to be back with the multicultural family, yeah? How many folk had been kind of affirmed since they've been here, yes? Who's, who's here for the first time, to went a Roundtable? I'm always amazed when I see the hands. You all just heard about this on rumor, huh? You all just came because... (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
 (inaudible ) 

00:01:23
DR. THOMAS PARHAM ...you wanna be here about it? Okay. Ah, It really is one of the most affirming places I think I can find in the profession. In most years, I think, whether I'm presenting or not, I try to make sure that I, I stop in for at least a day and usually the whole conference because it is that important to me. And we certainly wanna thank and congratulate ah, Dr. Constantine, certainly Dr. Carter before her, and certainly Dr. Sam Johnson before her, who I had the privilege to be a part of the first Roundtable Sam Johnson organized back in 1983 when I was the young Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania so, it's nice to kinda be back in the roots. 

00:02:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Ah, we have a little time this afternoon. And I wanna talk about the notion of rediscovering the roots of counseling psychology with the subtitle of, of how do we transform intellectual commitment into social justice and community action. And as I begin, let me call on the Creator and my ancestors to bear witness to my remarks in hopes that what they hear through my words and utterances will reflect their way, and they will be pleased. Let me try to be quick to lay out some constructs. I'm gonna try to talk about 25 to 30 minutes. I'm gonna try to leave a big block of time ah, like 20 minutes or so for us to have Q and A so they've set up microphones on the side ah, which we'll be able to use, so that's kind of the format. That's all right with you all? 

00:03:05
 Yeah. 

00:03:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM All right. So I'm really pleased that we, we come to this place in a, in a city that is known for its high energy and skyscraper landscape, in a place that's known for its culinary delights and restaurants in a, in a time of considerable uncertainty about our future. And we come really this afternoon to flex our intellectual, emotional and, and spiritual muscle. Are you all ready to flex a little bit? 

00:03:40
 Yes. 

00:03:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So we gather this time not merely as, as people from different races and genders and physical abilities and sexual orientations, religious preferences, but as professionals and, and students, committed to helping. Despite all the differences we have, we are united by our common bonds of commitment. We are connected by our desire to provide counseling and support services to people in need. And we ought to be dignified that our knowledge comes from a profession that is a noble one, whose roots extend to a time when counseling pioneers had to respond to the cries of social misery. Now, at a moment, when we are faced with the ambience of extreme abundance, how many of us can point to ways in which we're blessed everyday, yes? Extreme abundance. It's easy for us, blurring the lines between our personal and professional capacity, to lose sight of those who are less fortunate. And in an hour when thoughts are focused on war and disaster relief and educational underachievement, those dominate our thinking. It's easy to divert our attention from other domestic problems that create nightmare realities for many of our nation's citizens, the people who find their way into our offices, into our counseling centers, into our spaces where we practice our healing prayer. 

00:05:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM But despite the high unemployment, the, the increasing uncertainty about our futures, despite the corporate scandals and wars abroad, I think that I and, and we ought to be heartened by the countless acts of courage that we see, yes? We ought to be inspired by people's ability to persevere, and you gotta be able to see perseverance as key because so much of what we do focuses only on pathology and what they see on the negative end, but in that perseverance is strength. We ought to be inspired by people's ability to persevere, and we ought to be determined like my friend, Cornell West(ph), reminds us that we will never allow misery to have the last word. 

00:06:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Are you all feeling me? You are not feeling me yet. See, meeting here against the ambience of, of conference ritual tests the mental of each of us today because it forces us to confront what do we really believe. Do we really believe as either professionals or students in training that each person is entitled to pursue life's dreams uncontaminated by life's hardships. Do we trust that the clients and the patients that we serve can overcome the negative circumstances in their lives? See, if we have no conviction then our frustration with social misery is, is great. It's huge. If we have no faith, then we must be prepared to relegate the clients we work with to perpetual victim status, for our lack of faith suggests that somehow social lives(ph) are so formidable, an obstacle, they can't overcome it. 

00:07:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  So, we treat people as if they are their circumstance rather than they come from circumstance. Are you all feeling me? But if we believe in what we profess, that counseling can be empowering. If we believe in what we profess that counseling can be transformative. If we believe in what we profess that counseling must address the real needs of clients and not just play out our roles prescribed for us in textbooks, then the empathy, compassion, caring, and sensitivity must be mixed with a recognition that our roles as professional counselors and psychologist cannot be restricted to passive listening or advice given at an arm's length. Our clients are hurting, institutions are still oppressive, organizations are still discriminatory, and we must seek to change this condition. We must seek to change that condition. Now, as I reflect on the social misery that plagues our nation today, it invites us to take a retrospective look at the discipline of, of counseling psychology because if you consult the literature as I do frequently, one is able to discern that the discipline of counseling psychology has been generally defined by, by Ivey. He wrote a brilliant piece, so when he talked about counseling psychology being one of the most broadly based applied psychological specialties. And I'm thinking less here about just degree and more about function because whether you are clinically trained, counseling trained, socially trained, developmentally trained, community trained, everybody is doing some counseling somewhere, yes? Everybody, part of that counseling family. 

00:09:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And I'm reminded that at the turn of the century, 1900s, the discipline of counseling was formed in among other things to address the vocational issues of the time, and their capacity to help was formed and initiated out of the need to address the growing misery index of poverty, unemployment, and homelessness, that characterized the nation at that time. Who reads history, yes? Fast forward a hundred years later, 100 years later, and I worry if we are in danger of, of violating our initial commitment to address the social issues of our day. What happened to that spirit of counseling psychology that said, "We have to address social misery as part of our identity?" Take a look around the nation and instead of us running behind our counterparts trying to get prescription privileges or, or Medicare reimbursement, we ought to be paying attention to the social misery. It is increasing with no end in sight. You see the same thing as I see everyday. Racism's still on the rise. Jobs continue to be lost despite the Bush Administration's claim that they're creating a million new jobs. Four million came in, ten million went out. 

00:10:55
  Yeah. 

00:11:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Yeah, fuzzy math, fuzzy math. Health care and prescription services continue to be unattainable for too many children and seniors. Continues to be a national assault on affirmative action of other diversity programs 'coz now we're trying to decide we don't need affirmative action, what they call it "we need affirmative access". "Why, we had enough of ya' all colored folk and gender folk and everybody else up in here now." So, they're trying to dismantle all the games their folks sacrificed and died for decades ago. Poverty is a norm for too many of our nation's children. Look at the misery index. Over in Afghanistan trying to liberate women in Burkus and we're still paying women 70 cents on a dollar in the U.S. The misery index is still high. Women continue to receive less pay for equal work. Violence is on the rise and plagues most communities like a bad plague. Schools continue to be underfunded despite the admonition of No Child Left Behind. "I promise, No Child Left Behind." Really. 

00:12:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  The teachers and counselors, we trust with the intellectual growth and development of our babies, go on strike every year to earn a decent wage, and athletes who entertain us struggle to make ends meet on a million-dollar-a-year salary, is something wrong with that picture to you? Katrina victims continue to experience nightmare realities, displacement. Can you imagine waking up, no home, no job, no finance, no visible means of support, no way to take care of your family, no future. Displaced, and now we got them moving in spaces where, put 'em in hotels, wanna act like we wanna argue about which part of the federal government is gonna pay the bill, so now we're putting them out on the street. Are you all paying attention to this? 

00:13:15
 (inaudible ) 

00:13:19
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Where is the voice of counseling in this? Where is the voice of counseling? And then Katrina victims being retraumatized because they're dumped into some of the urban cores of our nation surrounded by the pathology that characterizes it. Picture on the news the other day told it all, CNN, family displaced, intact family, black male, black female, three black children, and the children are sitting out on the sidewalk having been moved from the Gulf region into, I believe it was Houston, sitting covering their ear because at night the gunfire gets too loud for people popping off guns running by with gang violence. Can you just imagine? 

00:14:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  We are homeless people still struggling for dignity in the face of very tough times, trying to find dignity amidst all that misery, and rather than being treated with compassion and dignity, a lot of which by the way have mental health issues and no funds to house them, and no funds to treat them so we just kick them out on the street. Struggling for dignity in the face of tough times, and rather than treat them with respect and dignity, we treat them just like tokens on a Monopoly board: we sweep them off of the street, send them directly to jail without passing go or collecting $200. There ought to be something wrong with that picture. 

00:15:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM The misery index is increasing, and my question today is what has the counseling profession done about that lately. You tell me, we being true to our legacy? What do you think? Is our focus on national health care and third party reimbursement, and privileges for prescribing medication and certification and licensure and, and identity issues meant to help somebody? Or are they designed to fuel our own sense of importance and promote greater access to personal wealth? Indeed, we in the discipline of counseling must find a way to promote greater levels of social justice that have been too absent from my repertoire of community intervention. 

00:15:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Now when I talk about social justice here, understand that I'm not just talking about equal protection. What I'm really talking about is equal opportunity. And the challenge of helping professionals, I think is to advocate for those who are on the margins, to give voice to those who have something to say but are rarely heard, and use our positions to help transform a social system that is often times seen as oppressive and discriminatory. We got people just giving up so that they don't wanna even try. And I stand here today arguing for a more committed social justice agenda and I can't help but, but recall the brilliance of, of, of Dr. King, Martin Luther King, Jr. and the life of Coretta Scott King who we recently bid farewell, too. She want to join the, brother Martin and the Creator and the angels and the community of ancestors. Anybody ever had a chance to watch Coretta's service? Masterful, nice tribute. But it's fascinating to me how we embrace Coretta in death, embrace Martin in death, acting like we adhere to principles. What do I see? We embrace each of them as heroes and heroines, but we fail to engage their principles. We spend too much time worshipping personalities instead of studying and embracing principles so what happens, as soon as the leader goes, the movement stops. Why? Because we're so personality-focused. Have nothing to do with principle. And I gotta, I gotta speak on that for a second this afternoon and, and lots of us know, you know, that I have a dream and I've been to the mountaintop and, you know, if we're really hip and cool we might've even led, a letter from ah, a letter from ah, Birmingham Jail. 

00:18:05
DR. THOMAS PARHAM But if you really get into the core of some of King's principles, nonviolence, social resistance. But what did he do? You see that, King had an animal instinct because he roared like a lion, while, he also soared like an eagle. Do you all feel me? Y' I'm not feeling that yet. He roared like a lion. Take a look at his classic essay on a time to break silence. Now, why should all of you know about that one? Because that essay was delivered right here in New York at Riverside Community Church. 1967, just about a year to the day before he was assassinated. And King was the first time, very publicly that he had spoken out against the war in Vietnam. And he said that there comes a time, this is a lesson count, so there comes a time when silence is betrayal. Are you all feeling me? 

00:19:05
 (inaudible ) 

00:19:07
DR. THOMAS PARHAM You're all starting to feel me now. Silence is betrayal. Now, let me contextualize this for you. Early 60s in the country, civil rights, black power movement ushering in, peace movement ushering in, long hot summers, riots in almost every urban area in a four, five-year span, Watts in '65, Detroit, Newark, name it, they were rioting. So the Administration in Washington says, "Oh, we gotta have a war on poverty and physical fitness and education and all these other things." So they now got all these government programs. But what starts to happen? Program money started to dry up. How come? No money to take care of domestic priorities in '67. 'Cause it's all going to Vietnam and dropping bombs on folk thousands of miles away. And then King would go into the inner cities, talk with the young brothers and sisters. "Put down your guns, that ain't no way to solve your problems." And they simply looked at Martin in the face and said, "Brother, how're you going to tell us to put down our gun and the federal government got planes and weapons of destruction that they use to deal with national disagreements they have with other global entities around the world?" King said, "No more, cannot be silent." In his life, he challenged the corruptness of an American government. They spent more time and, and, and money on war and machines and destruction than it did on educating and feeding children. He raised his voice about a racist system of injustice and oppression in his life. He spoke out against people who fed themselves on a daily diet of hatred and racial denigration. What did he do? He roared like a lion. 

00:21:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  In a similar way, I think we can't properly honor his legacy or Coretta's or the historical legacy we inherit from the discipline of counseling psychology, and remain silent about the social, political, economic, injustice that continue to plague this nation and the clients we serve. There ought to be something wrong with the picture. More than 2000 young American soldiers, men and women, lost their lives in an unjust immoral war. Not one weapon of mass destruction have we found, imaginary or otherwise, has been identified. Something wrong with that? 

00:22:05
  Yes(ph). 

00:22:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Over some oil and retaliation? And a one person in a 9-11 plane, Iraqi? There ought to be something wrong with a picture that shows a government official's stock portfolio, growing amid clear conflict of interest relationships with companies like Halibert(ph). And we sit in silence. So what happens, what happens to the people that Derrick Bell characterizes as the faces at the bottom of the well? They get angry. They get depressed. They get anxious. They despair. They lose hope. We've been silent too long and we have to raise our collective voice of outrage. We can no longer give in to the fear of being labeled on American and allowing that tactic to broker our silence on these issues. We cannot fall prey to that sleepy, sickness of apathy wherein differences, the blanket we use to cover our heads at night from the truth as if somehow the safe haven of academia insulates us from the degree of social pathology that exists right outside these walls. Are you all feeling me? 

00:23:30
 Yeah. 

00:23:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM We cannot give in to the need for social validation or somehow the opinions of others who oppress us are valued over those opinions that articulate that there's clearly something wrong in this country, in our communities, in our schools, in our universities, even in our own households. Rogers(ph) was clear in his self theory, said there's an internal and external source of validation, but the older we get, the weighted(ph) in the external side ought to give way to a little bit more internal fortitude. Most of us still operate as if somehow we are those 5, 10, 9, 8, 7-year-old children, when life would crumble without the social validation we receive from significant others in our life, some of which don't even like us. How many of us have been there? 

00:24:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM See as I reflect on the counseling psychology, we have to learn to roar like lions, too. Look at the social misery that plagues our nation because it challenges us to make some difficult choices. As psychologists and counselors, what do we choose? What is our role we play everyday? Do we choose to help our clients adjust to the social pathology that contaminates our lives and their lives? Or do we choose to confront systems that create nightmare realities for our clients? Do you choose as your role to turn a blind's eye to systemic issues? Or do you work to change and transform organizations and institutions whose policies and practices are crushing, working class and poor people? My fellow psychologists, counselors, students, helping professionals, our profession has historically been in the forefront of proactive and developmental strategies for intervention. Yet in today's climate, we seem to be almost retarded in our efforts to promote social justice and community action, almost retarded in our level to promote social advocacy, and we have to do better. 

00:25:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Now, my last few minutes before I open it up. What I want to address is a conversation about not just systemic change, systems have to change. But I'm aware that systems are made up of people. So I wanna really spend a minute talking about personal change. So I want each of you to understand that transforming intellectual commitment into social justice and community action requires a sense of personal empowerment. So, let's talk about empowerment for a minute. What is empowerment? If you consult a dictionary, what does it say? Empowerment says to give official authority or legal power to. Are you feeling me? To give official authority or legal power to, to give. Implied in that definition is a notion that somehow power must somehow be given to you by an institution you work in. So, what do we do? We all sit around waiting for permission slips to be social advocates. And I wanna question that assumption today, I wanna explode that assumption today because I believe that power is derived by giving it to yourself. As we sit here this afternoon, you may be tempted to believe that somehow transforming intellectual commitment into social action tries to, to find somehow this, this empowered helping professional who is an exceptional individual. But exceptional, my friends, has less to do with being great and more to do with being unusual. The question is not how great am I, how powerful am I? The question is how unusual am I willing to be. It makes it pretty simple. How unusual am I willing to be? So as we consider the question of how to transform intellectual commitment into social justice and community action, let me just run through what I think are some characteristics that make us unusually different in our profession. How can we become the exceptional professional and students that we need to be in order to make a difference in the lives of the people we purport to serve? 

00:28:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Three factors, I think, are important. It's analogous to what the elders in my community used to say, "Boy put some pep in your step." Let me just invite you to put some pep in your step this afternoon. One, you need pride. What is pride? Pride is a pleasure satisfaction taken in something belonging to oneself. It is a simple question that says, "Do you believe that what you do is significant, worthwhile, and makes a difference?" Do you have pride at being a helping professional or you're just taking up space? You gotta put some pep in your step. Second factor, enthusiasm. What is enthusiasm? It's just a lively interest. But what am I really asking about when I talk about the passion of somebody like a Michael D' Andrea? I'm talking about do you salivate at the thought of going to work everyday on behalf of social justice. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And third, I'm talking about power, not the power that you derive from the permission slip, but the power that reminds us that real power is not military might. It's not who got the biggest, baddest police force. It's not when these kids on the street got a gun on the side and a wad of money in the pocket and a beeper selling something. That's an illusion of power. Real power, my friends, is the ability to define reality. And to make other people respond to that definition as if it were they own. We lose our power because we allow other people to define for us, reality. We're always chasin' someone else's vision. It's time for us to stop that. Are you ready for some pep in your step? So what's the first thing we need? 

00:30:35
 Pride. 

00:30:35
DR. THOMAS PARHAM What's the first thing we need? 

00:30:40
 Pride. 

00:30:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM What's the second thing we need? 

00:30:40
 Enthusiasm. 

00:30:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And the sec, and third thing we need? 

00:30:40
  Power. 

00:30:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Power. You got to put some pep in your step. How do we do that? So I believe we have to mentally create a belief system about that. You have to believe that you can make a difference, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 101. You gotta open up their head, plop that old CD out with that negative message, pop a brand new one in, and we've got to burn a new CD. Take that old garbage out of your head. We got to empower ourselves. The first belief you have to have you'll power yourself, right? I wanna burn right on this CD first that says one person can make a difference. Rosa Parks sat down. Martin Luther King spoke out. Asian brother in Tienanmen Square stood up against the tanks. One person sat down, one person spoke out, one person stood up, one person can make a difference. You have to believe that your contributions are significant, worthwhile, and make a different. 

00:31:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  The second element that creates a sense of pride and enthusiasm and power is the belief that somehow we can create a social organizational climate that does validate each individual's unique and divinely inspired humanity. We must believe that we can change social climates. Did you burn that message on your CD? We can change social climates. A little more than a decade, we'd driven people who smoke literally out of doors, and the social stigma associated with people who would dare smoke in the room of nonsmokers is so pronounced most people wouldn't dare violate the social norm, not 'coz there's a sign on the wall but as soon as somebody would light (inaudible ). The social combination is so great and we are still in need of social validation they use it to their advantage. So people begin to kinda check themselves. My question is if we could do that for smoking, you mean we can't do that for racism? We can't do that for sexism and we can't do that for homelessness? We can't do that around a child(ph) and something that biases and the assumptions we bring with us into our work spaces? 

00:33:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  Our third belief that seems to reinforce the sense of pride and enthusiasm and power is the fact that people perceive themselves as having a greater sense of competence in most situations. Consequently, they hold themselves accountable and others accountable. A brother this morning in the workshop mentioned about some Klan marching in, where was it, Jollyette(ph) outside of Chicago trying to protest something going on at the community college. How would you feel about we dealt with that war 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, yeah? My fight ain't with the 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 Klan; that's about us inconvenient as a flower in an elephant's behind. My fight is with the thousands of others in the community who sit in silence and watch them do that. That's my problem. I'm not gonna change their attitude. You can't legislate attitude, but I can sure make it uncomfortable for them to bring that mess out of the closet with the social condemnation that we all represent as a collective community. We have to hold ourselves and other people accountable. You see, my friends, intellectual commitment is merely a cognitive activity or a state of thinking wherein one plays there's a promises to do something. If we're intellectually committed to an idea or social change, we may believe it's important, we may believe it kinda has merit, but I looked at all the internship classes for the last five years and said, "What have we, right, done in terms of taking these folk from all these different schools," and those are the schools I wrote to. Where are we getting applicants from? And I send them a nice letter, "Dear Department Chair, For the last five years we have been grateful to receive applications from your class for a whole bunch of lalalalala folk. They have been masterfully trained to doing blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank and we've been really appreciative, but this is a new day and I am not happy or satisfied with the level of cultural competence and diversity training that these interns are arriving on the internship with coming out of your program. So guess what? Unless you start training them better, your students will have a hard time getting an internship in this counseling center or getting hired on this staff. Very truly yours, Love and kisses, Parham." 

00:35:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Now, I don't control the whole profession, I don't control the one little fight, and I can sell a wolf ticket like that. In most places 60, 70, 80 applications, I get somewhere between a low year 110, maybe as many as 150 applications a year for four spots in my internship. I get access to the best of the best people, and I send it out to all those departments. Send it to my counsel, send to colleagues at the Association for the University and College Counseling Center Directors of Higher Ed. Take this letter and send it to the people. All of us join hands and say, "We're not satisfied with the cultural competence issue." It would change over night. You wanna know how many have sent it out? I think less than two or three out of a couple hundred of them. Everybody's scared. What can you do? One person can make a difference. You just have to be willing to both roar like a lion but also soar like an eagle. 

00:36:55
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  As I prepare to close, I always leave you with two thoughts. The first thought, an opportunity to make a difference in terms of social justice is a threat if you only predict failure, but it's a challenge if you think we just might win. Do you all think we can win at this? Do you all think we can create a greater level of social justice? Huh? An opportunity is a threat if you only predict failure. If you think you're gonna lose, if you think you're gonna be scared, if you think you're gonna be crashed, haa, it's a threat. But it's just a mere challenge if you think, we can win at this. Why? I got some pep in my step. I got pride, enthusiasm, and power. I got the power. 

00:37:50
DR. THOMAS PARHAM  And lastly, my good friend Dr. D 'Andrea was fond of reminding folk in workshops this morning. I don't want you to be a hundred percent better on 50 things, too big. You're all right here for the Roundtable," and he said, "Dr. Constantine, I don't know 'cause Parham said so we gotta go out here and, revolutionize the whole disciple of psychology: counseling, clinical, community, developmental, and social, uh-uh, too big." It's like that New Year's resolution we make every year and then we don't remember three months later what we had promised to do. My goal for you is not to be 100 percent better on 50 things. My goal in all humility is simply in, to invite you to be five percent better on one dimension of social advocacy, and if we could be five percent better on one dimension of social advocacy and add up all the five percents in this room and all around the country, we can literally transform our profession overnight. Are you all feeling me? Who's willing to give me five percent? Who can give me five percent? An opportunity, my friends, is a threat if you only predict failure, but a challenge if you think we just might win not 100 percent better on 50 things, five percent better on one. With that I'll stop and say thank you. Thank you, Dr. Constantine for the invitation. It's been my pleasure.
