UNKNOWN Hello, everyone. My name is Dr. (inaudible ) I'm a faculty member here at thesis uh… Counseling Psychology Program. I'm here to introduce our speaker today. Umm… She's Dr. Muninder K Ahluwalia. She's an associate professor in the Department of Counseling and Educational Leadership in the College of Education and Human Services at Montclair State University. Dr. Ahluwalia received her PhD in counseling psychology from New York University. She serves on the Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs of the American Psychological Association and the Editorial Board, excuse me, Board for Journal for Social Action in Counseling and Psychology. Dr. Ahluwalia engages in research and scholarship with her students focusing on intersecting identities of racial and ethnic minorities in the US, with particular attention to the psychological impact of racism and discrimination on individuals and communities. Current research studies include the experiences of faculty of color teaching multicultural competence, and the experiences of the Sikh youth in the face of religious oppression and discrimination. Dr. Ahluwalia also has a consultation practice where she engages in assessment and training related uh… to multicultural competence. So please join me in welcoming Dr. Ahluwalia.

MUNINDER KAUR AHLUWALIA Thank You, Branna.(ph) First I just want to say you rock because you said Sikh. And people never pronounce the word correctly, so that was very nice to hear you uh…. pronounce that correctly and represent my community so well. Umm… So as he said my name is Muninder Kaur Ahluwalia. I use my middle name uh…. Kaur because every Sikh woman, every woman in my community has that middle name and that's a really important umm… indicator for me. So the title of my talk is, so you basically study yourself, studying the Sikh community from the inside. And so you can… I'm guessing for those you the do community research, within community research here, you've heard that. Oh, so basically you're studying yourself in a way like, it's less than and it's not as important. Umm…but we, what we do know is that it's very important for many of us to study our marginalized communities because if we don't, nobody else will. And if they do, they do it poorly. Umm… although, you know, as we were saying earlier, Roger, that allies do it very well too. So umm… from Montclair State University, and let's see if I can use a clicker right. So you'll notice these uh… emojies up here on the left is a Sikh man, on the right is a facsimile of a Sikh woman, the one in the middle is me. And the one, and the people who made these were two of our students at Montclair State one is Tyson Adrich(ph) and the other one is Roman Randhawa,(ph) who's not able to be here today but a shout out to him. In particular, Tyson is very helpful in this presentation. Umm…so an overview of what I'm gonna be talking about umm… is, I'll be talking a little bit about social media, and what does the world see and what do you see when you look at Facebook, Twitter? Who am I? Unpacking my identities. What do I study? Sorry, before that who's around me? What are my contacts? What do I study? Why do I study it? And what have I learned from that? And why, the reason I decided to do this is my presentation is so often when we study marginalized communities, communities of color, we make them or they become very vulnerable to us, to the researchers. And oftentimes, we as researchers don't have to be very vulnerable in that situation. And, and what I would argue is actually, we have to become very vulnerable before we can study people who are vulnerable in the world. So that's what I'm gonna try to do here. I'm gonna make myself a little more vulnerable than I do in academic talks. Umm…so when you think about the news, uh… what do you hear in the news about Sikhs if you hear anything? Anyone? Yes. Uh… that they're often mistaken for Muslims. Yes. And if you take it one step further than that, so there, Sikhs are mistaken for Muslims, and Muslims are often mistaken for terrorists. Right. So there's this transitive property that happens with Sikhs and Muslims, right, that they become associated incorrectly and inaccurately with terrorism. What else about Sikhs might you see in the news? Yes, Amanda. Right. So umm…prominent, a prominent Sikh, so my cousin Waris, was asked to remove a turban at airport, so that, when, you saw that a lot in the news as well. Umm…so you're not hearing a lot of great things about Sikhs. Right? Whatever you hear, you hear negative, umm… and often inaccurate. Umm…and so this is just some of the news that you might see. And what Dr. Brandon(ph) was referring to earlier about the, the man who's asked to remove his turban. His name is Waris. He's my cousin. He's also kind of a celebrity. He's an actor and a jeweler to the stars. Umm… but he has a lot of power and that's how it got into the media, otherwise all the other hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of Sikh men who get stopped at the airport including many of my family members, and community members, they don't get the media profile. Right? Umm… and you might think about Facebook. So what do you see on Facebook, if you see anything on Facebook? Right. So there might be some really positive images bottom left, you'll see the positive images and positive media. So this is a post of Humans of New York. And this was a profile picture for a while. And this is a mother and a son at the Sikh Day Parade in New York. On the upper right hand side, you'll see something that's sort of, was used as a negative posting and a lot of racist comments that came umm… around this and went kind of, of a little bit viral.

MUNINDER KAUR AHLUWALIA So basically, so this is my cousin again and I talk about him a lot today, I usually don't. Umm… but he again got a lot of visibility and having to post put together this one minute thing about sort of what two Sikh here at the airport and in particular Sikh men, you know, like, you know, what's on that? What's on your head? You know, where are you from? The question that a lot of people uh… particularly people color here, where you from, now where you really from, when he says America. So these kinds of things also go around Facebook a lot and, and have been very positive. So I've had friends who should who are not Sikh and not people of color share this on their own Facebook page. Umm…so on Twitter again these are the kinds of images that you see. My favorite is the upper right hand one, which is like, a bunch of Sikh men in turbans wearing H & M clothing. It's an H & M add in Times Square. Umm…and this is, the Huffington Post again was trying to do this thing of hash tag, what a Sikh look like. Umm…and so you wanna think about, we know what your images are of Sikhs. But a lot of the images were, you know, of families, of like, me and my colleague. So hashtag Sikh colors, you know, a bad ass guy in front of his bike, a little tiny boy who's like too in front of a motorcycle, really you know images that are very ordinary but become extraordinary because they are different than the images that mainstream US thinks of when they think of Sikhs. And so here is umm… is a painting and if you see this painting, what do you see in this photo? Of this painting? A girl braiding her hair? Yes? Sit again looking herself in the mirror so who is this girl? Would you guess? 

00:09:40
[sil.] 

00:09:45
MUNINDER KAUR AHLUWALIA She looks like your sister. She looks Mexican. What's she doing? Yeah, she braids in her hair. All right. Say it again she's maybe evaluating herself where's she going. School? Yeah, so that's me at the age of maybe 11. I was going to play in an orchestra concert. I went to a public school. And I was braiding my hair as I did every day that's how I wore my hair growing up. And I went to a very white town as Irish Catholic and Italian Catholic. And I'm wearing something that really didn't quite fit in so it's a silk and velvet long dress toward an orchestra concert so kind of fit but it didn't really like nobody else for anything like that. But I'm a Sikh, and I was raised in a Sikh family. And so my mom's not gonna buy me a short dress to go to a concert like that's not something that she would think of doing so I wore this. You know thought I was looking real cute. But I was also thinking as I was looking in the mirror like, how do I fit in with the people that I'm going to play in the orchestra with, how do I stand out? I felt really alone in my struggle as a child, I felt like, I was the only one in town and the only one in the world that felt like I did. What I learn now is that obviously it's a very common bicultural experience of not knowing where you fit. But I think the sense of aloneness that I had as a child is where the seeds of interest were planted to study people of color generally, and their experiences, and in particularly later on my own community. So the today's talk is about my role as a researcher studying my own community. Well, I'm not so grandiose to think that you all care about me although some of you might. I do think it's important for me as a scholar, a teacher, a consultant, and a trainer to share my positionality in the world. Because when we don't share who we are prior to sharing our perspectives, we run the risk of projecting our perspectives, our biases et cetera onto others, and particularly on to those we study those we teach. So just like the media and social images, if you don't know who's promoting a messages, a message you don't really know what it means. So, Who am I? So I'm 44 year old, US born, able-bodied mostly, cisgender female, heterosexual, upper middle class, Indian American, and Sikh. So if you look at any one of those identities, you would think you know a story about it. Right? So you think about 44 year old. Or you think about somebody being US born. Or you think about somebody who's cisgender female. But the reality is no one of us is anyone identity. Sometimes, one becomes more important in context, and the other go behind. But really we are the intersection of all those and that's our social location and so you have to think about how this intersection of all these identities really is where you look at the world from. So similarly, I would encourage you as researchers, scholars, practitioners, instructors to think about that as well. So what is your age? What's your developmental disability? Do you have one? Do you have an acquired disability? Do you have a religion? Do you believe in a religion? What's your ethnicity, socioeconomic status, Sexual orientation, whether or not you have indigenous heritage to this country? What your national origin is? And what your gender is? So it's important to think about what these are but it's also important to think about how they stand in US Society. So are your identities dominant or non-dominant? So you look back at my identity for a second being able bodied, being heterosexual, being a cisgender female, being upper-middle class, being us-born, those are all dominant identities that carry power and privilege with them. The other identity is being Sikh, being Indian American, sorry, and being a female, so being cisgender is dominant but being a female is non-dominant. Right? So that's kind of a little bit of a mixed identity. So you wanna think about which ones are dominant, which ones are not. Umm…and so I'm back to this paintings again, I'm just because I like it. But the reason is paintings back again is that if you don't actually see how people around you are different than you and value it. You will do what this young woman is doing. right. You will look out there. And you will see yourself again, and again, and again. And that's a problem when we're studying people. Right? Umm… so what do I study? My scholarly agenda is uh… basically people of color and white systems, racism and discrimination, and Sikh individuals and the community. And so people of color in white systems, uh… one of the things that umm… Shirley(ph) and I are, are working on with another student is looking at faculty of colors experiences, teaching in, teaching multicultural competence, and what that's like in their interactions with the administration. And so that study I think has been really informative because no surprise what do you guess their experiences are like, faculty of colors experiences, and teaching in white universities, teaching multicultural competence. Difficult. Yes. Isolating, difficult and yet they do it, right? Exhausting and that those are the kinds of themes that they have, and some do it by choice and some have to do it because their thought of the ones who need to do it. Of course, the people of color are gonna teach about multicultural competence. Why would the white faculty do that, right? Umm… so that's the study that's going on right now for us. I study racism and discrimination in particular uh… most recently post 9/11 I've been studying Sikh individuals and community. And you would think, oh, of course right after 9/11 I must have got into this study. But no in fact what happened was right after 9/11, I was so shook up by the experience that I had in my own country, that I was paralyzed for several years and I did not study my community, I studied other random generic things. But I remember thinking again and again what can I do. Every single man in my family experienced some kind of pretty heinous act, at least one. So my cousin Waris was beat up in the city. My brother who lives in Atlanta was run off the road. My brother, few days after 9/11 was stopped at the airport and forced to remove, you know, asked to remove his turban. Again if you're not beeping, you shouldn't be asked to be removing any kind of head covering. I had job, you know, a yarmulke, a turban, any of that, right? Asking a man to take his turban off in public is kind of asking a woman to take her top off in public. Right? It's a very sacred thing. Am I walking down on 9/11, I was with my parents. And we were walking down the block, the block that my parents lived on for 40 years. And I remember a neighbor, a neighbor who knew us well, scream out the window saying, go back to your home terrorist bombers. And so for me, this, all of a sudden being an outsider in my own country was like, okay. So if America is not my country, what's my country? Because I know India don't want me. So that was a really hard process for me. But with a lot of my colleagues and friends support, I started to explore the idea of doing something with the Sikh community, and then I started to volunteer in the Sikh community, and then I started to study the Sikh community. And so the first study that I did was on Sikh men and their experiences of discrimination and racism. Which by the way I think an important piece to talk about with that is so when you study marginalized communities, what do you notice about publication? Is it easier or harder to publish when you do research on marginalized communities? Harder like, a lot harder. So I remember so I study on Sikh men it was a qualitative study. How many times do you think I needed to submit this to different journals? Seven? Close, could you know? It's actually eight. The eighth time was the charm. Every single journal I sent it to said, well, you know, we don't really study this so like a men's journal, a gender journal, a religion journal, I'm like so what journal actually does study this. Ended, ended up being published in the Asian American Journal of Psychology which is a relatively new journal. So yeah, it's fascinating. So to, to it's important to think about that when we study within community, it is harder to disseminate that information. It's very important but it's harder. So why do I study it? Right. So going back to those earlier slides of the pictures, why do I study? What I study for? Why do I fight? What I fight for? It's because of my people. You know, the people that are important to me my friends, my students, my community, my family. It's service to community and that's really important in my religion that it's one of the most important things in Sikhism is to do community service. And community service is not just for other Sikh. Community services broadly construed as anybody who's in the community of humanity. Education, I think that just by doing the studies that I do I educate people whether it's through journals or whether it's having a conversation presenting at conferences. Social justice which is the other huge tenant to Sikhism is really important to me and that's what I'm trying to do study for to help with social justice if you think back to that faculty of color thing, the study that I'm doing about faculty a color teach multicultural confidence. Well, how is that related to justice? Well, It is because that study when published is really helpful for faculty that are going up for tenure, faculty of color who've been teaching multicultural confidence courses. Right? Get lower evaluations, have a harder time, have a larger wear and tear on them, well, having research out there that says, this is true is help more helpful than them being able to say hey this is true. So make sense. So in a sense, I feel like the research hopefully is going to help towards justice. And the final piece is this, this racialization of religion that has happened with Islam and Sikhism that I'm still teasing apart but it's very fascinating about how religion is talked in the country, in the United, talked about in the United States now. And I think, it's really talked about in a way that is that is racialized religion which is odd because if you think about within any religion, there's lots of racial differences. Right? Even in Sikhism there are Indian Sikh and there are white American Sikh. So there's actually a decent size of white American Sikh have converted to Sikhism. And if you think about Islam, Islam it's much broader than that. Right? Like, you can really say any race, uh… there are, there are Muslims within any race. But it has become sort of racialized, so Muslims have become targets not only because of their race but also their religion and that intersection has become a really uh… has been used as a weapon as opposed to really celebrated for what it is. So this racialization of religion is why I also study Sikhism. Umm…so the current research study that (inaudible ) and I are working on is on Sikh youth in Queens, and we're collaborating with the Sikh organization for anybody who's collaborated with any kind of community organization. Has anybody done that in the room? What can you say about it, is that easy? No. It is one of the hardest things you can do is collaborating within an organization because they have their own agenda and rightfully so right like a lot of Sikh organizations are fighting for justice. They have law, they have policy, they, certain things they wanna do. And I'm like well, I wanna study the psychological impact on Sikh youth of discrimination. And they're like, great. But what we really want you to do is this, this and this. And so it's this constant negotiation with the organization of, "how do we do it, what do we do, how do we study it, how do we keep confidentiality for the participants? So I would say, you know, we've been doing that and we're now at a good place to finally move forward. Umm… so over 50% of Sikh youth in Queens are experiencing discrimination those that are not from New York, it's Queens New York. And there's a very large Sikh population there. And so you think if there's a large population why are they experiencing so much racism? Anybody have a guess about why that happens? Right. So when you have a large enough minority, it starts to look like a threat. Right? When it was just me and my family in the white town, we're not really a threat more like a group to make fun of but not really a threat. This group is now seen as a threat. Right. It's a immigrant community mostly who is, you know, trying to make their world way in the world. And so they, the kids they are experiencing a tremendous amount of racism and discrimination. So some of the things that have happened is like, Sikh youth, Sikh boys, or Sikh girls here, here which is a sacred symbol in Sikhism. Their hair has been cut. Their hair has been set on fire. You know, boys are called girls which has been very typical in Sikhism. And you'll also see this a lot with the elderly that the that people will walk up and punch elderly Sikh men in Queens. So this very weird kind of, for me weird kind of racism that's and discrimination that's happening in this community. And so my research team is awesome. I have one Sikh students for the first time in my life, and one student who is biracial identifies as African American and having the two individuals one outsider, one insider, and me also an insider has been amazing because we've had to explain things that we take for granted and that's essential in the process of doing research, I think. it's also really important to have another Sikh for me because I think my experience of Sikhism is the experience of Sikhism guess what clearly it's not mine is again if you go back to that identity chart with all those intersections, I'm that kind of Sikh the 44 year old upper middle class, New York, blah, blah, blah, blah Sikh, right. And Roman was raised in California and, and has lots of other identities. And so the conversation of what does it mean to be Sikh what do we celebrate, what do we, what do we abide by, how do we look etcetera. Look is very different for both of us. And so finally, I just wanna say some of the lessons that I've learned. You have to have a researcher stance and, and no matter what you're doing you have to have a stance. If you're teaching, if you're doing research, if you're doing clinical work, you have to understand how you, your position influences, how you see the world, and you have to understand how the context you live in and the people you surround yourself with influences how you see the world. And so as I'm talking about research here, again I'm very typically we talk about a researcher stance. People often only do this with qualitative research and not even everybody does this. But I would argue that you need to do it whether it's qualitative research or quantitative research. There's no like, you know, objective study so having a research stance is essential. Umm… you'll be surprised if you allow yourself by your research and that's true no matter what I remember when I was doing a study on Sikh women, again you're gonna be amused, I was in my 20s, I was doing a study on Sikh women who are in their 20s Indian. Yeah, I was trying to study myself. And so when I was studying, the, you know, talking to these women, I was surprised that they didn't see themselves like me. I remember when one participant with some anger said to me, well, you don't really know what it's like to be Indian because you really light-skinned. And she's very dark-skinned and I should have been surprised but guess what I was surprised. I was like, wow! You're right. First I was offended. I was like, what? I'm brown. But I have to think about what does it really mean to be brown and Indian and what does it mean to be light-skinned and Indian? What kind of privileges and goodies and what kind of passing can I do in the world that she couldn't do? So allow yourself to be surprised. You have to work with the community. So it's hard it is to work with a community organization. You have to do it if you want to do it right because otherwise you're doing what you wanna study up in your ivory tower by yourself. Umm…that you have legitimacy inside the community sometimes, but to be honest, I don't have a lot of legitimacy sometimes. I'm 44 years old and single. In the Sikh community most women who are 44 years old are married. So being single and 44, gives me sort of a weird place, but I'm a professor which gives me a little buying because everybody likes professors in the Indian community. Well, most people. We value education blah, blah, blah. And so, so I get a position of respect in the community. So people sometimes, I don't know how people gonna treat me based on my singleness, based on my femaleness, based on my professorness etcetera, right. Umm…and then a legitimacy in academia. And this is something important to consider. I'm not gonna say if you're not tenured, you shouldn't study your own community. What I'm gonna say is if you're not tenured, you have to think about how you're gonna study your own community, and how you're gonna get published, and all those other things. Because sometimes within your own community that first slide I said, oh, so you basically study yourself that's what people in academia will think like, that's not a real legitimate area of study. And finally the path is Sikh youth. So right now I'm studying Sikh youth. Before I study Sikh men, I don't know what I'm gonna study next. It could be not my own community. It could be another community. A lot of what I study comes out of what's not being studied, and who's not being heard, and where does justice need to sort of be served so depending on where the world goes in the next several years, it could shift again. Umm… so I think that's about it. I will say, thank you very much for being here because you could have been hearing Bill Cross(ph) or some of the other very awesome presenters, and now you're like what, Bill Cross(ph) was presenting. Yeah, so he's been presenting since 11. So umm…thank you very much for being here because now you heard something about Sikhs and that's deeply meaning, just that enough is deeply meaningful to me. Umm… if you have any questions, your comments or stories we have about eight minutes or so. Oh, on this final paint is my, this final picture is a drawing, my mom's make, my mom's an artist. My mom's making a painting of me now and so this is where it, where it is right now.
