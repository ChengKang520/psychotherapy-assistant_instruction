Microtraining Associates Presents Queer Theory 2 with Julie Tilsen Ph.D. David Nylund Ph.D. Last year, Tighearnan and Dr. Tilsen talked about a variety of ways he might stay connected to his Mom across differences. Here, Julie and Tighearnan check in one year later... Following their update, is a reflection with David Nylund about their experience. 

00:00:45
JULIE TILSEN It's been, pretty much precisely here, to the day, give or take, a day, since you and I met again, or, met for the first time, to do this. And, I would be interested in checking in with you to see, uhm, how things have been going over the last year. Uhm, did you have anything in mind in particular that you wanted to talk about today, when, ah, we gave this invitation to you to do a one-year check in? 

00:01:20
TIGHEARNAN About, ah, my mom's transition, and how we're interacting. I can't say a whole lot hasn't, uhm, unfolded, but a few key conversations that we've had in the last year, have really, uhm, shown me growth and movement in our relationship. And we had a conversation about her, uhm, wanting, a daughter, but really what she wanted a relationship that closely mirrored her and her mothers. And I brought to her attention that perhaps we do have that relationship. There are things that, you know, you could tell me that you can't say to my brothers. You know, we kinda have that relationship. Actually, I think we do have that relationship, if you just kinda take gender out of it. And she, for the first time, I saw her think critically, like, kinda the face I have sometimes. Think critically about, uhm, about what I said. 

00:02:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:02:15
TIGHEARNAN She was quiet after that, and I knew that she really something really clicked with her with that statement. 

00:02:20
JULIE TILSEN So that was sort of the turning point for each of you, and for the relationship? 

00:02:30
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, I wouldn't say it's a turning point, but it was definitely, uhm, a mile marker as far as where she was with understanding our transition, not only my transition. 

00:02:40
JULIE TILSEN Okay. So as a mile marker, in what ways did that maybe give you hope to stay on that road for the long haul, or that perhaps you were further along on your journey than you thought, what, what did that mile marker mean for you? 

00:03:00
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, it, it, gave me more faith in being patient with my mother. Uhm, sometimes I get really exhausted having to explain myself, or deal with some of the pressures that she puts on me about my transition. And knowing that she's still willing to think about it, and think about it critically, and still engage in these conversations about, uhm, I guess, my transition. 

00:03:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:03:25
TIGHEARNAN That she still cares, and she still to be present with me, and that's just, for me, very impressive, I guess. 

00:03:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:03:35
TIGHEARNAN Given her background, and her belief system. 

00:03:40
JULIE TILSEN In what ways would you say you were trying to point out to mom that she still got the same kid she always had. 

00:03:45
TIGHEARNAN I think she, you know, she's always really, uhm, loved my sense of humor. And my dad had a really wonderful sense of humor too, and that's how we kind of all connected, uhm, I wouldn't say in a powerful way, but in a very, uhm, consistent way. So, are you asking about, like, how I interact with her, or? 

00:04:10
JULIE TILSEN No, I guess when you had the stroke of genius to say let's parse out gender for a moment. Uhm, it seemed to me you inviting her to, like you said, I think we have that relationship that you want, and I'm wondering if there were ways in which you wanted her to see, uhm, the stuff she was looking for, but gender was always kind of in the way. Does that make sense? 

00:04:40
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, yes. 

00:04:40
JULIE TILSEN So what, what are some of those things you were hop-- hoping she would see. Humor sounds like one. 

00:04:45
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, how she feels more intimately with me, than, than my brothers. And that she can tell me things about her relationships in the family, or, uhm, the friendships that she has, she can talk to me on a more intimate level than she can my brothers. And it's not just because they're away, I'm sure she actually talks to them more than she talks to me, even though I'm closer to home, uhm, but it's the content in what she says, I really feel like she's able to, uhm, unload, or vent the certain things that she won't say to my brothers. 

00:05:20
JULIE TILSEN So when you removed or asked or to sort of imagine away, for a moment, gender would you say that she was able to see some of the things that have always been there, but she was looking for 'em? Didn't know they were there? 

00:05:35
TIGHEARNAN I think it gave her a chance to think about what she really enjoys about our relationship. And for her to go, oh, well I guess it really doesn't have to do with your gender, I mean we don't go shopping like, I did with my mom, you know, or, or my grandmother. But, we do have those talks that they so valued so much when they went out. 

00:06:00
JULIE TILSEN Oh, almost like she started maybe understanding that it wasn't the shopping - 

00:06:05
TIGHEARNAN Uh-hmm. 

00:06:10
JULIE TILSEN - it was the shopping was sort of the vehicle, or the context for the relationship. 

00:06:15
TIGHEARNAN Right. 

00:06:15
JULIE TILSEN And that you guys were doing that relational stuff. You just, don't go to the mall to find it. 

00:06:20
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:06:20
JULIE TILSEN All right. Uhm, you know, as you talk about that, I'm wondering, when your mom started seeing you in ways that you appreciate being seen, and that also help her see who she wants to see, who did you start seeing in your mom, that maybe wasn't available in your line of vision? 

00:06:55
TIGHEARNAN A friend. I think for a very long time even to this day, after my dad died, she's kind of walled up and is very vulnerable and short in a lot of ways. And I think her kindness and compassion always kind of stunted because of the things that she's had to do in her life. How hard, uhm, it was on her. And she is really focused on that. And I don't really know if she knows how to have fun, so when we joke and we hold on to the type of humor that we share, it really, it really fills her. And I think that's what she, uhm, gravitates towards. 

00:07:35
JULIE TILSEN The humor and the fun. 

00:07:40
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:07:40
JULIE TILSEN Are you teaching your mom how to have a bit of fun? 

00:07:45
TIGHEARNAN I, I was thinking about that recently, and - 

00:07:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah? 

00:07:45
TIGHEARNAN - and how my interactions with her are kind of grumpy, and I go over there to do laundry, or, you know, something, I'm always asking for something, where I should be, giving more and spending more time with her, but, it's, it's hard to show her how to have fun. She needs to make that decision, I don't know. I don't know how to put that. Uhm... 

00:08:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. Uhm, you know when you said that, now you think you've seen in her a friend, I'm wondering how that connects with, uhm, what you just said about feeling like you, you wanna do a little more, give a little more to her. Does that, is there a connection between seeing your mom as a friend, and feeling like you wanna give something? 

00:08:30
TIGHEARNAN I think so. I think of her less as, uhm, a source of contention, uhm, and I'm trying to push myself to be more compassionate and patient with her, so that friendship can grow. We've spent so long cut off from each other, in an emotional way, and not just the ways that we've expressed emotions before, but in general. That we weren't really able to be friends without yelling at each other. Or understand that kind of dynamic, so I think, if I am just more patient with her, in letting her, uhm, I don't know, explore her emotions, and where she's at, that she's more able to give that back to me in understanding, ah, my transition, and our transition. 

00:09:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So this mile marker, uhm, seems to be a point along the way that, uhm, provided clarity for you guys around the role of gender, around what-- who you are and what you can bring to the relationship, around who she could be, and, and who you guys can be together in a relationship. Uhm, and, a place around, along the journey where you seem to be refueling yourself with compassion and faith, like you said, in your mom. Are there other significant things that this mile marker, uhm, has made available to you, or, me-- or, available to you? 

00:10:15
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, about anything in particular, or? 

00:10:20
JULIE TILSEN Just curious when you talk about such a mile marker, anything else? 

00:10:25
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, I think I carry a lot of guilt, ah, with not being so patient with my mom before. And learning how to, let go of it. I realize that I've been carrying a lot of guilt for a numerous amount of things, and this is just one example that I really need to let go of and use my energies for being more patient and compassionate. 

00:10:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:10:50
TIGHEARNAN And understanding that reaping those benefits is having a stronger relationship with my mom. 

00:11:00
JULIE TILSEN If your mom were to appear, ah, and had been listening to us talk right now as part of our conversation, uhm, what would she say about how you've described the, the recent events, the mile marker, uhm, from your perspective, what would she say how she's experienced it? 

00:11:25
TIGHEARNAN I don't know, I think she would say that's life. I think that she would simplify it and not think to critically, like, it kinda is what it is. And, it's just how relationships unfold, and this is how we understand each other. 

00:11:40
JULIE TILSEN Is that a way, she may not use these words, but I think you and I are using them, is that a way your mom might say that, that she has faith that things work out? It's life, they unfold. 

00:11:55
TIGHEARNAN You know, I haven't really thought about that, but perhaps. 

00:12:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:12:00
TIGHEARNAN Maybe. 

00:12:00
JULIE TILSEN Is that an understanding you had of your mom six months ago, a year ago? Or is that a new understanding you have of her now? 

00:12:10
TIGHEARNAN That she has faith in our relationship? 

00:12:10
JULIE TILSEN That, yeah, things unfold, that's life. 

00:12:15
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, I don't know. I, I think she does a lot of things out of duty. And, out of responsibility. And not necessarily out of wanting to do things. Not to say that she doesn't to have a relationship with me, but I don't necessarily know it sounds like an asinine thing to say, I know my mom loves me, I know that she really cares, even though, how she's never abandoned me out of 25 years. But I know some of that is definitely out of duty and responsibility. But the majority of it is, of course, that, I'm her child and she loves me. A lot. 

00:13:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Kinda, ha-- how moms are supposed to go through the world. Right? 

00:13:10
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, the intrinsic definition of a mother. 

00:13:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, you, sounds like you understand that that can be quite, like you said, a chore. I think you said, or duty. 

00:13:20
TIGHEARNAN Yes. Very much so. She looks at the bad as a chore, and the rest of it just something that she can really find joy in. 

00:13:25
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. You know, uhm, when you talked about how it was through sort of temporarily suspending the idea of gender, that opened up maybe this new understanding, when you asked her to do that, you know, I, I wonder where for someone like you, where gender has been so constant and central, what is that like for you? What does that take for you to ask someone to imagine away gender for a moment? 

00:14:00
TIGHEARNAN I see it as a tool. As a tool, I, there's so many different perspectives on gender and how they relate to I guess I could say the relationships that you have, and to find a way to frame something for somebody that they would, I mean, I need some of these tools, how I interact with the world, uhm, if I had to explain myself out of a dangerous situation, I need to know how to find that for somebody. 

00:14:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Yeah. Was there ever a time, for you, Tighearnan, where, say, let's imagine gender isn't here. Let's imagine I'm not a gendered person, and I'm not a, ah, ah, so deliberately consciously gendering myself person, was there ever a time where you could've imagined, ah, asking that to sort a disappear itself for a while? Was there a time... 

00:14:55
TIGHEARNAN In myself? 

00:14:55
JULIE TILSEN Well to, to, to use that as a tool? Was there a time where you would've not ever imagined doing that, where that would not have been okay? To say, let's disappear gender for a moment. 

00:15:10
TIGHEARNAN Actually, I think a, a lot of trans guys that I know are a lot of people that have discussions with gender. They talk about that. I wouldn't say it's prevalent conversation, but imagine if-- and I, and I, think the reason why we don't imagine if, more, is because the reality is not so. 

00:15:25
JULIE TILSEN Where were those imaginings taking you and some of your buddies at times? What possibilities did it open up, personally and in the world, or some relationship? 

00:15:40
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, can't really remember half the conversations that we had, because it always ends up with (inaudible )-- imagine it. 

00:15:48
JULIE TILSEN Well, Tighearnan, imagine if there was no gender. 

00:15:50
TIGHEARNAN Uhm. 

00:15:50
JULIE TILSEN Where does that take you? 

00:15:50
TIGHEARNAN It takes me to equality. With ability. Some part of me still thinks that if society did not have a gender, that it would still find ways to other people. 

00:16:05
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. Other, do the exoticizing the other, the other-ing of people. 

00:16:15
TIGHEARNAN These non-gendered people can't do this, these other non-gendered people do this. And, you know, I'm sure society, if there was no gender, would find a word for that. 

00:16:25
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. So, the, your imaginings take you temporarily to a place of more equity or genesis? Or something about how you understand the world, that undermines that hopeful moment. So how do you keep going? 

00:16:45
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, I've made my decision about whether or not I'm gonna drag my feet, or run in this world. And I think the best way is just to walk. To take it a little at a time, 'cause if I dig my heels in, it's just gonna be more painful. 

00:17:00
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:00
TIGHEARNAN More stressful, and I'm using more energy just to try to stop, when I can't stop. And if I run, I'm missing so many things that I'm missing the good with the bad. So if I just walk and take it one day at a time, I know if go to sleep, and I wake up, I'll have more energy for that day. Did that make sense? 

00:17:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Well, what it makes me wonder about is, was there a time where you saw it only as this either or dig my heels in, hold my ground, whatever, or move super-fast through this, was there a time where it seemed like it was those kind of opposites, as? 

00:17:40
TIGHEARNAN I want to do that sometimes- 

00:17:40
JULIE TILSEN You wanna do that. 

00:17:40
TIGHEARNAN Notice I wasn't so conscious about that idea for a large part of my life, so I was either digging my heels in, or I was trying to run through the whole thing. 

00:17:50
JULIE TILSEN What got you to, uhm, slow down, pay attention, and keep moving? 

00:18:00
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, noticing when I dig my heels in for a long period of time, how tired and emotionally exhausted I am. And then, if I run through things, I have loved ones telling me that I've missed things. 

00:18:10
JULIE TILSEN How does that transition from a heel-digger, and a runner, to, ah, a walker, uhm, correspond at all with some of these other transitions? Gender, ah, transition in the relationship with your mom, any, anything else? 

00:18:35
TIGHEARNAN I think there is just a point in my life where I, I realize that I'm missing more things, or I'm making things harder on myself, and it kind of, expanded my capacity to take things in, and process them better. 

00:18:50
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:18:50
TIGHEARNAN I think it's just a maturity of the way I process more than, uhm, what it's, what it's adding to my life, I guess. 

00:19:00
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Tighearnan, I'm wondering, uhm, in, in the next few minutes, that we have, if there's anything in particular that you'd like to speak to, something I haven't thought to ask about, or maybe we got a little derailed as we were moving from running to walking, and, is there something in particular you wanna make sure you speak to? 

00:19:25
TIGHEARNAN I wanna go back to how I frame something with my mom - 

00:19:25
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:19:25
TIGHEARNAN - and what came of that. Uhm, being able to kinda dismantle, uhm, the way she processes our transition, my transition. Uhm, a few months ago, actually, she kind of stopped me and said, you know, why can't you be a lesbian, you could have your cake and eat it too. I'm like it doesn't really work that way. Uhm, so I urged her to just hear me out for a little bit, and we had a conversation, ah, in the car, actually, for about an hour, and I tried to explain to her the difference between gender identity, gender expression, gender sex and sexuality - 

00:20:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:20:00
TIGHEARNAN - and I said, hang in there with me, and listen to what I have to say. 

00:20:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I mean those things, people with more information than your mom conflate those things all the time, and here she is struggling alongside you with that. What did that mean to you that she would even say that to you. 

00:20:20
TIGHEARNAN I think what struck me - 

00:20:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:20:20
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, wasn't that she said that to me, but that she was willing to have a conversation about it. She goes, okay, I don't get it, what's the difference. And she was-- I was like, oh my gosh, she's willing to listen. She's, she's usually allergic to it. She's willing to do it right now. 

00:20:40
JULIE TILSEN So, if she's gained a little bit of, uhm, ah, immunity to those conversations, what would you say has been the supplements you've been feeding her over the last years, or the antidote you've been dosing her with, so that she's prepared to, to-- not only have this conversation, she is almost sort of initiated it, she invited it. What have you been doing to dose her for this, and get her ready for this? 

00:21:05
TIGHEARNAN Uhm, just, I don't know, my maturity, consistency in how I live my life, the things that I say to her, uhm, about the choices that I make. I think show her that, there's a separation between how do I put this, there's a separation between immaturity and how I make my decisions as an individual. And that they don't necessarily coincide with each other that I can make my decisions, ah, well, that's difficult, because she constantly sees me as immature, but I'm just trying to assert my individuality. Uhm, does that makes sense? Like, I'm- 

00:21:45
JULIE TILSEN Sounds like stuff that moms and youth and young adult kids go through all the time. I'm 50 and my mom still fights me about decisions I make. 

00:21:55
TIGHEARNAN So that'll never change. 

00:22:00
JULIE TILSEN Oh, I'm sorry. 

00:22:00
TIGHEARNAN It's okay. 

00:22:00
JULIE TILSEN So, so you have this conversation, and, is there something else you wanna say, or just that, that happened, was what - 

00:22:10
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:22:10
JULIE TILSEN - things you wanna make with them. 

00:22:10
TIGHEARNAN I think they were definitely related, though. How I was able to separate kind of that, that gender and focus on our relationship, and then later she can come back and try to understand that part of me. 

00:22:20
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:22:20
TIGHEARNAN So it's a very slow process, but I see that they're inter-related. And it's moving forward to a more, uhm, open conversation type of relationship. That I can share more with her, I guess. 

00:22:35
JULIE TILSEN You're walking together? 

00:22:35
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. I like that. Very good. 

00:22:40
JULIE TILSEN Anything else that you'd wanna say about that? 

00:22:40
TIGHEARNAN Hmm, I just see us moving forward and, you know, getting me to look back that last year, those two things happened, and even though it's taken a year, it's still, it's still progress to me. It's still, uhm, working towards a more cohesive relationship with my mom. 

00:23:00
JULIE TILSEN Uh-hmm. Cool. One more question. 

00:23:05
TIGHEARNAN Sure. 

00:23:05
JULIE TILSEN So, we do this a year from now. If you imagine forward, what might be the mile marker you'll be telling me about a year from now? 

00:23:20
TIGHEARNAN I guess my mile marker would be her, uhm, accepting, accepting me, in a way that she could show that is by using my chosen name. In a consistent basis that reflects her respect for me. 

00:23:40
JULIE TILSEN So when you say consistent, she uses Tighearnan now, sometimes - 

00:23:45
TIGHEARNAN Uhm... 

00:23:45
JULIE TILSEN - but not all the time? 

00:23:45
TIGHEARNAN When talking to other people that she doesn't know. Like if she is making a reference to me. 

00:23:50
JULIE TILSEN But to your face. 

00:23:55
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, it's-- I urge her to use honey, or dear, or pumpkin, pumpkin-face, she used to call me that when I was little. I much prefer that over my old name. 

00:24:05
JULIE TILSEN That's very generous of you, just like your dad. Okay. 

00:24:10
TIGHEARNAN Yeah, we have to grace each other. 

00:24:10
JULIE TILSEN Okay. All right. Well thank you. Sounds like it's been, uhm, an important year. 

00:24:20
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. I really enjoyed this. 

00:24:20
JULIE TILSEN Thanks. Thanks Tighearnan. 

00:24:20
TIGHEARNAN Of course. 

00:24:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:24:30
The Reflection 

00:24:30
JULIE TILSEN So, Tighearnan, what we're gonna do now, like we did last year, is, Dave watched, listened to our conversation, we're inviting him in, right now, uhm, to offer a few reflections that things have struck him as he was listening and witnessing our conversations. Perhaps he may have questions for either one or both of us. About how we experienced the conversation. And we do this as a way to sort of metaphorically expand the conversation by bringing another perspective. Giving us things to reflect on it becomes more generative. For you, for me, uhm, for Dave. And hopefully other people that are watching. And, so that's one set of reasons we do this, and the other set of reasons is, uhm, in an effort to be more accountable to you, the person that we're working with, uhm, we're trying to be really transparent, and this is a way Dave can ask me some questions about where I was coming from, ask you questions perhaps about how you experienced it, and, try to, further demystify, uhm, you know this whole thing called therapy. Okay? Dave, would you wanna a-- add anything to? 

00:25:50
DAVID NYLUND No I think that's - 

00:25:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:25:50
DAVID NYLUND - that's a good description. Uhm, - 

00:25:50
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:25:50
DAVID NYLUND - it, it was really uh, a privilege to witness this conversation. Just to be, uhm, kinda, in a, ah, reflective position to see the two of you walk through that conversation. That, that's, I really like the, uhm, the metaphor you used of, in life of walking rather than digging your heels in, and running. That's something that will stick to me as I work with other people. Particularly in my work at the gender health center. With trans and queer clients is that is that, ah, tendency to go from either digging to running. And I saw this conversation as really walking through, so that's, that's the first thing that stood out to me. Uhm, you know, and, a lot of focus of the conversation was on the developments and transitions with, ah, Tighearnan and his mom. And there's been a lot of preferred developments I'm wondering, I imagine you weren't so surprised about that. I mean, what, ah-- why were you not surprised, I guess is a-- what did you know in, Tighearnan from conversation last year? 

00:26:55
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, so you're asking me why I wouldn't have been surprised - 

00:27:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:27:00
JULIE TILSEN - to hear from Tighearnan that things had been on the move - 

00:27:05
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. Yeah. 

00:27:05
JULIE TILSEN - with his relationship with his mom? Uhm, you know I, I think that I was certainly really expectant and hoping to hear about how things were going with Tighearnan and his mom, because, ah, while there are many things from that conversation last year that struck me, tried to lay out the ones, that I-- that had been super present for me over the last year. To see what he wanted to, ah, continue, carry forward this year in our, in our conversation today. Uhm, you know, the stuff with his mom seemed-- in a sense, that almost seemed to be the hub around which the other important and resonant themes Tighearnan and I talked about last year were organized. Ah, so, it didn't surprise me because it was so prime and present last year. And, you know, he said, last year, I believe, and he just said today, I know my mom really loves me, while I think to me was unspoken, is how much he loves her. And, how important that is to him. And so, it didn't surprise me. It doesn't surprise me that, that, that relationship has been on the move and that they're walking more together. 

00:28:20
DAVID NYLUND Uh-hmm. 

00:28:25
JULIE TILSEN Just because of how central the way it is to both of them. 

00:28:25
DAVID NYLUND Uh-hmm. I could see that really touched you. To witness that. 

00:28:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, definitely. 

00:28:30
DAVID NYLUND Definitely. And it makes me think of some of my work where, uhm, because of gender is such a key aspect that it can really divide parents. So, it was touching to hear that. Uhm, as part of that, you were, you were, uhm, inviting Tighearnan to talk about teaching his mom. 

00:28:50
JULIE TILSEN Yes. 

00:28:50
DAVID NYLUND And one of those, one of those things that were really, related to that was, uhm, part of the transition was to reconnect, to connect with your mom, independent from gender, all the qualities and experiences you've had in your relationship that are apart from gender. And, and at the same time you're talk-- what was it like to temporarily suspend gender such, such a major part of your experience, and I got a sense when you asked that question, you were saying it's not an easy task, it's a pretty significant step to be able to do that. 

00:29:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, uhm, Dave, I wanna respond first to, uhm, the first bit of your comment-question. This idea about Tighearnan teaching his mom, and, uhm, I, ah, find my ear is always kind of tingling when I hear, uhm, something that unhinges, I think, our, ah, standard assumption that, uhm, teaching, we teach down generally-- generationally, that, elders teach young people. Which, of course, is very true. And, I think, young people can teach up. And we teach in all directions. And so I, I, I did wanna highlight and check with Tighearnan - 

00:30:10
DAVID NYLUND Uh-hmm. 

00:30:10
JULIE TILSEN - that I heard, was I hearing. 

00:30:15
DAVID NYLUND Right. 

00:30:15
JULIE TILSEN And I think I asked, was I hearing that, perhaps. He got to live into his idea of himself as an educator teaching his mom something as well. So, that first piece, and the second part of your question, uhm, when I asked him what it was like for him, or what it took for him, I'm not sure exactly what I asked, ah, to suspend gender for a moment, uhm, I wondered, I wondered if, uhm, that felt, ah, anything from just sort of a temporary strategic move to make room for his mom, and I-- for me I could see that as being very compassionate and gener-- generous. 

00:31:00
DAVID NYLUND Yes. 

00:31:00
JULIE TILSEN I wondered if it was a painful, yet necessary move. Uhm, that he was deciding to, uhm, offer, as a way to move forward together. Uhm, so I did wonder that. And I also wasn't surprised to hear what he said, that for him it's a tool. And, it didn't sound like, I don't think Tighearnan was saying that i-- it took a lot of him or anything. Uhm, cuz I've heard other, ah, trans folks talk about that. Uhm, and in my experience, sometimes, that's part of their movement too, is they sort of get to that place. So it did come, for me, from a place of have an experience, with people, and wondering, uhm, you know, well isn't, isn't that, quite a generous gift. Isn't that, uhm, maybe a bit of a falling on the sword, at least temporarily. In the face of the gender binary, or to try to facilitate a conversation. But, ultimately, to me, he, he talks so much about maturity in this conversation, to me, whatever the, uhm, issues or concerns, or things that someone has organizing themselves in relationships around, to be able to find a way in a relationship, to position yourself with a person you're trying to connect with, uhm, so you guys can move forward together, that is maturity. Instead of, digging in, or seeing yourself as a fixed person in a fixed place. 

00:32:35
DAVID NYLUND Yes. 

00:32:35
JULIE TILSEN So, all those things soft of connected together for me as conversation unfolded. 

00:32:40
DAVID NYLUND Right, right. And I agree it really, it touched me as such a, a generous and compassionate act to do so. In, uhm, with the experience of living in a culture with such rigid gender norms, so. And the, the conversation that led, you asked a question, something along the lines of what would it be like, particularly with your friends, these imaginings of living in a society where gender wasn't a defining aspect, or there was no gender, was there some thoughts or intentions that you had there? 

00:33:15
JULIE TILSEN Oh, I think I was just curious cuz he mentioned I don't remember exactly what you had said, Tighearnan, but something-- I think just kind of offered that, my friends and I kinda talk about that, and he, that was the tool he used-- hey mom, pretend that's not here. It was really just more, walking with him through this conversation, following that, and is that sort of a conversation he's offering me to, inviting me to be part of with him. 

00:33:40
DAVID NYLUND Uh-hmm. 

00:33:40
JULIE TILSEN It's just, sort of in the moment, curious about it. 

00:33:45
DAVID NYLUND Cuz you, you mentioned, in response to that, there would be more equality. You know, and seems like that has con-- continued in your relationship with your mom. The thing that I found interesting is by focusing on not talking about gender, it opened up some space for his mom. And Tighearnan to have a more, uhm, direct conversation around the complexity of gender identity and sexual identity, so, don't know if you had, something struck you there? 

00:34:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and, you know, we could keep talking, I mean it-- I think, I'd be really interested in finding other places, whether it's in Tighearnan's relationship with his mom, or in other situations where, when we turn away from something, we actually gain some traction to move back into it. 

00:34:35
DAVID NYLUND Uh-hmm. 

00:34:35
JULIE TILSEN That it's not this head on, uhm, it doesn't-- not even head on as in confrontation, but just not a direct move into something, often makes room for us to get where we wanna go. 

00:34:50
DAVID NYLUND Uh-hmm. 

00:34:50
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, so, yeah, that's one of those balls I was holding up in the air that we just didn't get to pick up. 

00:34:55
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. And that, near the end of the conversation, you know, as you were walking through this conversation, you invited, ah, Tighearnan to imagine - 

00:35:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:35:05
DAVID NYLUND - a year from now, December 2012, uhm, where things might be, and any thoughts about what you were imagining there, or, hoping that would. 

00:35:15
JULIE TILSEN Well, you know, uhm, when my, ah, tendencies, I guess, in practice is to really move up and down the temporal dimension in time. Uhm, ah, cuz as we think about stories, s-- s-- stories are narrated along timeline, and we often narrate them in the past and the present, but I think we have a lot of opportunity, we ca-- we can narrate our future, uhm, and a year ago, he may not have imagined sitting here talking about having this, his mom, invite this conversation about this stuff, and say, okay, le-- whatever it was, I'm listening, tell me, explain, whatever, you know, you may probably didn't imagine that a year ago.3 

00:35:55
TIGHEARNAN No. 

00:35:55
JULIE TILSEN No. So, why don't we imagine what he can't imagine a year from now? 

00:36:00
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:36:05
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, that we can begin creating and, ah, seeding, uhm, the possibilities that you wanna see emerge. 

00:36:10
DAVID NYLUND Yeah, yeah. What, what, uhm, came up for me, is, ah, this, future, ah, imagining, a year from now, that you're actual-- your mom actually is, is here. Cuz we, we talked about the possibility of her comments, you kinda entertained it, but maybe next year no pressure, but I'm just thinking, you know, that just-- that's what popped in my head. When, when that conversation happened. Does that make sense, is there? 

00:36:35
TIGHEARNAN Yeah. 

00:36:35
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. 

00:36:35
TIGHEARNAN That feels about right. 

00:36:40
DAVID NYLUND Yeah. Uhm, any, any comments, reflections about the conversation that you and Julie had, or the conversation we just had? 

00:36:45
TIGHEARNAN I think it's really interesting that you bring up how, uhm, we teach generationally down. And, side to side, so I think my mom really does have that idea, that she should be the one imparting knowledge on me. But for her to grace me that space, uhm, to teach her. I think is important. 

00:37:05
JULIE TILSEN Uhm, your understanding that in her context, that is an act of grace, act of stepping back to make room for you to do that. Cool. 

00:37:20
TIGHEARNAN I think that's about it. 

00:37:20
DAVID NYLUND Cool. Thank you. 

00:37:25
JULIE TILSEN Thanks Tighearnan. Thanks Dave. 

00:37:25
TIGHEARNAN Thank you.
