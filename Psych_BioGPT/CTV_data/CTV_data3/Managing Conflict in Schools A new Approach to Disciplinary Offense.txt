00:00:30
A New Approach to a Disciplinary Offense

with 

00:00:30
John Winslade, Ph.D. 

00:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE Hello, I'm John Winslade. And this is a video and a series of videos about school counseling. 

00:00:35
John Winslade, Ph.D, 

00:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE  This first one is a video about the restorative conferencing process and I want to just introduce that to you a little bit and explain what it is about. 

00:00:45
Restorative 

00:00:45
Conference 

00:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE A restorative conference is a process that helps address a disciplinary issue that has occurred within a school context and a school resotrative because it aims of actually restore the relationships that have been harmed by whatever has happened. 

00:01:00
Address a disciplinary 

00:01:00
incident that has 

00:01:00
occurred in a school context 

00:01:00
Restorative = 

00:01:00
Aims to restore 

00:01:00
relationships that have 

00:01:00
been harmed 

00:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE In the process that I want to speak to and show you here today, there's a basic principle that we have adopted as a sort of a motto for the whole process and there is this. 

00:01:10
The Person is not the Problem 

00:01:10
The Problem is the Problem 

00:01:10
- Michael White 

00:01:10
JOHN WINSLADE The person is not the problem. The problem is the problem. So what is this mean? 

00:01:15
Not seeing people as 

00:01:15
defined by what they 

00:01:15
have done 

00:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Well, first of all, it means not seeing people as being defined completely by what they have done. In other words, not totalizing them as a person who has got something wrong with them. 

00:01:25
Totalizing 

00:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE  Instead, we are interested as seeing people as multiply-storied, not in deficit in some way. 

00:01:35
Seeing people as 

00:01:35
"Multiply-storied" 

00:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE And we also are resisting the temptation to see them as a type of person and to explain their actions in terms of what this type of person might do. 

00:01:45
Gilles Deleuze 

00:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE That's done for number of reasons, one of them is in line with the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, who talks about how events are logically prior to identities and he believes that is true. And what I want to show you here is a process that involves focusing on what happened as an event rather than as typical of a kind of person. So in a restorative conferring mode, what's necessary to do is to think about the lines along which harm has been done by someone to somebody else; in other words, in a relationship. That from a point of view of restorative practice is more important than restoring the authority of rules or a people who are in charge of those rules. And the assumptions that we make is that when someone does harms to another person, they create a sense of obligation to fix that harm that they have done. And that's what is meant by responsibility, the ability to respond to a situation which you've done harm and to address it and to set things right. The conference that we're going to show you is not supposed to something that happens in order to find out what happened. It's not a about a -- it's not like a court case, in other words. It relies in fact on having sorted out what has happened in advance. And it also relies on the -- being in the person who did the offending at least some degree, at least the modest degree of acknowledgement that they did what they're accused of doing. The aim of this is not to find out the trues of what happens so much, just to put it right, to make a means for the situation that has been created by the offense. 

00:03:30
Aim is not to find 

00:03:30
out what happened 

00:03:30
but rather to make 

00:03:30
amends 

00:03:30
Responds to a 

00:03:30
disciplinary issue. 

00:03:30
Aimed at 

00:03:30
producing learning. 

00:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE It's a process for responding to a disciplinary issue and it's aimed at producing learning. And this is not always the case with many punishments, so it's different from a focus on punishment. In punishment, somebody is treated as deserving some kind of outcome or some kind of response from authority to what they did. In this case, the aim is to produce learning about what happens on relationships when you take particular actions. It's is focused on not excluding the person who has done something wrong, but on including them, or re-including them back in the relationship and in the school context. 

00:04:05
Re-including them into 

00:04:05
the relationship 

00:04:05
and into school context 

00:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE And in this way, avoiding what often becomes the result of exclusion, which is sending people on the pipeline to prison as it sometimes called. So rather than isolating individuals, it's a process of including more voices in the conversation rather than just the ones of the central characters. And the assumption that is made here is that people have a much greater likelihood of responding to the voice of another person who they have harmed and who they have some relationship with, then in just to the voice of authority, because people who are again trouble a lot learn that it's easy to shrug off the voice of authority. The process that we're gonna look avoids an emphasis on the causes of events, we're not trying to find out what caused what happened. 

00:04:50
Not identifying causes 

00:04:50
JOHN WINSLADE  And that's because causes of events between people are often far too complex to actually identify anyway. In any way they are back in the past and the causes lie back in the past, and therefore they can't really be changed. So what we're more addressed in is identifying the effects of what happened, because those are things that are still there and that can be changed if we set about changing them in a particular delivered way. 

00:05:15
Rather identifying the effects 

00:05:15
Changes 

00:05:15
effects 

00:05:15
rather than 

00:05:15
causes 

00:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE And that's what this process does, changes the effects of what happened rather than the causes. It's a process that can be adapted for a number of purposes, so I don't want to specify here exactly where you might use it. Some people have used it as an alternative to suspension processes in schools, some have used it after suspension as a way of bringing somebody back into the school. Some have used to as an alternative or as a process in the middle of an SST conference, the Student Study Team conference. And sometimes people have smalled it down, what I'll show you is a full process, but you can actually make it smaller and use it even in a conversation with two or three people in the space of 10 minutes for much smaller and more minor events that happen rather than the ones that lead to sort of serious responses by like suspension. It's important, however, that this kind of process is not accompanied by a punishment, because if you use a punishment process along with a restorative process, the two compete with each other and then punishment process can actually sabotage the possibility of restoration. 

00:06:25
Focus not on building up 

00:06:25
one story 

00:06:25
but rather 

00:06:25
developing competing 

00:06:25
JOHN WINSLADE  The assumption here is that the focus needs to be on building up not one story, but competing stories about what people have been doing and what those things mean. And the complexity that's involved sometimes is a little puzzling at first, but it actually works out, because what it shows is that people do have more than one story that can be told about them. 

00:06:55
People have 

00:06:55
more than one 

00:06:55
story that can be told 

00:06:55
about them 

00:06:55
JOHN WINSLADE And I think that's always the case; and in this process, it is the assumption that governs the process. These competing stories can be held out and can be drawn and can be held out in contrast. You'll see here a diagram how that actually drawn into a diagram in the middle of this process. And as a result of that, the offender is given a choice, a choice between the two different stories represented by the two diagrams. When the offender makes a choice to make a change towards the story which is not about the problem, the community of care around that person has given the chance to wrap itself around them and support the change. This is on the belief that when more people are involved, the change is more likely to happen than when just one person tries to make a change on their own. Why? Because stories about people exist in relationships amongst the group of people, not just in one person's head. The role of the victim is also important and you'll see that the victim of an offense is invited to be part of the restorative process, because this can make a difference, quite a difference for them as well. They are given the first chance to speak about the effects of the problem on them, because they have been the primary recipients of whatever has been the offense. And they are asked also to say what is needed later on to address the problem to actually make things right, or at least as right as possible. That's not always can be completely restored. There is not a requirement on either the offender or the victims do any cathartic venting that's not part of the process. It's more a process of moving from one story to the other than of releasing emotion in a way that are actually produces a change. As you will see, this video is a role play. These people are role playing a situation which was constructed for this purpose. It is designed to illustrate a typical kind of process obviously a more successful type of process, rather than one that didn't work, which is not to mean that there aren't many challengers that this process comes up against, but we couldn't show you in one video all the possible challenges that have happened. Because, whatever you can think of, the chance is rather it has happened. I would invite you as you watch this to think about where are you might be able to use it and where it might be useful rather than to think start concentrating on where it might break down and why it might not be useful or where the people that you can bring to your mind might reject the process and not make it sabotage or make it not work. In my experience, many conferences like this, when they are held, do come up with much more creative outcomes than any individual authority figure could ever invent on their own as a punishment. And in fact, what happens is harder for people who would actually deal with, sometimes it takes much more courage to face up to people and put things right and it's much more difficult than just meeting a punishment and doing whatever is required by a punishing authority. So, I invite you to sit back and watch a restorative conference being played out. Okay. Welcome everybody. We are here to hold what we call a restorative conference. And this is a meeting that is called when something has happened that is going wrong at school. And the aim of this meeting is to help put things right after some kind of offense, some kind of problem has come to the surface. Let me just give a couple of rather comments about today -- about the meeting today and then we'll ask you to introduce each other. Introduce to yourselves, I mean. The meeting here is not about -- it's not like court hearing. We're not here to establish who is right and who is wrong and I'm not a judge. In fact, it's actually a meeting about restoring respect and trying to put things back into a situation where people can get on together okay in the school, which is what we want. So that learning can continue. So I would ask that each of you respects the privacy of the other people who are here. Is that okay? 

00:11:10
 Yes. 

00:11:10
 Yeah. 

00:11:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Because we don't want to just to spread around about to everybody what the things you said here in this room. I hope that's okay with everybody. And the aim of this meeting is not to find out what happened, because we've already established that and Ms. Myers is going to speak to that what she has found out about that in the past. The aim of the meeting is to fix things and to make meanings and to sort things out. And Christina, my understanding is Ms. Myers has told me this, you're willing to do that, you're willing to try and fix things and to try make a meanings, is that fair? 

00:11:55
 Yeah. 

00:11:55
JOHN WINSLADE That was why you've agreed to come to this meeting? Okay. There is going to time for everybody to speak and so I want you to be conscious of that and don't feel like you have to interrupt when anyone else is speaking, because you will get your turn, your chance. And my job is to make sure everybody gets a fair chance to talk. And the meeting could take an hour and a half, maybe even 2 hours sometimes. So I appreciate you being willing to give some time for this papers. And I'm going to ask you to introduce yourselves. But first of all, let me say that my name is John Winslade and I'm a counselor of the school here. So what I'm going to ask you to do is the introduce yourselves and say one thing that you hope will come from this meeting. It's my census that you've all come around here with some hope with this, something that would happen here. Maybe you John, to start. 

00:12:55
 Yeah. I'm Mr. Mitchell I'm a drama teacher here with both Devin and Christina and one thing that I hope to get out of this meeting is to rectify their friendship there as well coming into this year. 

00:13:05
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. So your hope is that this meeting will rectify the friendship? 

00:13:10
 Yes. 

00:13:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. You are the next. 

00:13:15
  My name is Daniela Lopez. I guess I came here because I want to know that I'm safe and I want things go back to normal. 

00:13:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So what you are hoping for is safety and things back to normal. Okay. 

00:13:35
  My name is Livia Lopez, is elder brother and the co-guardian. And I'm here to see that something happens of what would happened with my sister and Christina. 

00:13:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Something happens. 

00:13:55
 I want this to be rectified. So it never happens again. 

00:13:55
JOHN WINSLADE  Your hope is that it would never happen again, right? 

00:14:00
 Yes. 

00:14:00
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

00:14:05
 I'm Mrs. Vale, Christina's mother. And I need the situation to be over. This is like the third meeting I've come to school and I just needed to be done, so I can go back to work. 

00:14:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So your hope is that the situation will be over. Okay. 

00:14:25
 I'm Christina Vale and I guess I came here hoping that people won't say me as the bad person and I can give my same situation. 

00:14:40
JOHN WINSLADE People wouldn't see me as the bad person, right? 

00:14:45
 Yeah. 

00:14:45
JOHN WINSLADE And you're also hoping to have your same situation. Okay. 

00:14:55
 My name is Myers and I'm the Assistant Administrator here. And my hope is that these girls can learn to resolve problems in a non-violent way, peaceful and be respectful here in our campus. 

00:15:10
JOHN WINSLADE Learn to resolve problems in a non-violent way, peaceful way too. 

00:15:15
 Right. 

00:15:15
JOHN WINSLADE  Thank you. 

00:15:20
  My name is Cambria Ruth. I'm friend of both Dalia and Christina, and I am -- I just hope that they can resolve their friendship and stop all the drama. 

00:15:30
JOHN WINSLADE  So resolve friendship and stop all the drama. Thank you, everybody. So what we need to do is that first of all establish what happened and what has brought us of this meeting. And I'm gonna ask Ms. Myers to speak to this, because the school actually made a decision to call this meeting and Ms. Myers spoke to me and we actually made a decision that this meeting might be a helpful way to address things. So can you speak to -- can I ask you to speak to what happened, why the school took it so seriously and why we are all here? 

00:16:20
 Sure. Well, on Monday, October 5th, I guess it was an incident on Facebook, it will brought my attention by Mr. Mitchell. He came to my office and he talked with me about some posts that came to his attention when he talked with Christina. 

00:16:45
JOHN WINSLADE Some posts, what you mean by posts? 

00:16:45
 Some posts that happened on Facebook. 

00:16:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:16:50
 So, I did with a investigation and I talked with Christina and I talked with Dalia. And Christina admitted to the post -- I went online and I printed the post I don't know if you want me to read. 

00:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Let's see them. I think it's important that we know exactly what we get in them. 

00:17:10
 Okay. On October 5th, there was a post by Christina, tagging Dalia, saying someone should get in your face, no one likes you, you better walk your path tomorrow and drama, tomorrow might be the day and might be me and there was another post that said, oh and I know which way you walk home. So those were the posts that I permitted. And it was brought to the teacher's attention that I had a conversation with both girls and then also I talked with Mr. Lopez and I also talked with Mrs. Bell, so we had a conversation. 

00:18:00
JOHN WINSLADE So can you speak to why the school thought it was serious and ask that we call this conference here? 

00:18:05
  Sure. Well, this obviously it's really serious because this is affecting school, it's affecting our academics, even though this didn't happen on campus, their argument in class is disrupting school activities, which with other students, they're having problems in learning and getting along and also this is the first incident, because when I looked through Christina's discipline record, there was another incident in the past recently this academic year where she threw a stapler in a different classroom there was another incident where she stood out of the class room, she has a few detentions for missing assignments, talking bad to the teacher. There was another incident with spreading rumors, which mean another girl. She has few truancies, so this isn't the first incident and that's why it's really concerning to me, because this is something that repetitive that's ongoing. 

00:19:20
JOHN WINSLADE  And this particular series of messages on Facebook, did you take this to be more than just like messages, or it's like some kind of threat, is that right? I mean it sounded to me like a threat. I'm just wondering, was that how the school? 

00:19:40
 Yeah, definitely. Yeah, this is a reminder. These are reminder posts that mean this definitely is sounds threatening, it sounds harassment, sounds like bulling, I mean, it sound like she is directly threatening her, because she tagged -- Christina tagged Dalia's name in the post. And she also threatened, might be in drama. So, I mean that's not acceptable, we can't have violence and threats and bulling and harassment happening in our school. 

00:20:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So the school has taken this seriously? 

00:20:20
 Very much. 

00:20:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. So Christina, can I ask you, you've heard about Ms. Myers read out, does that sound accurate, because we didn't talk about this before the meeting and I just wanted to check this with you. 

00:20:35
  Yeah, it sounds accurate. 

00:20:40
JOHN WINSLADE So you acknowledge that this is what that happened, okay. And Dalia, can I just check with you, is this -- does this sound accurate to u as well? 

00:20:50
 Yes. 

00:20:50
JOHN WINSLADE  All right. Thank you both, because that helps us to go ahead. We're not arguing about what happen, we heard actually put it right, okay. So, okay. I'm now going to ask you each to think about what you've heard and what you know and your own perspective on the problem. I'm gonna ask you to tell me what you -- in a few words, why you would call the problem that happened and how -- what we are here to deal with. And I'm going to write what everybody says and put it on the white board up here. So let me just move to doing that. So, I'm gonna ask one person to volunteer to start, who is the volunteer? And then we're gonna go around the circle from there. Okay, so what I'd like to hear from each of you, remember, is what you would call from your perspective this problem that we're here to deal with. We've heard about from Ms. Myers, what you call it? 

00:22:05
  I'd say it was a threat. 

00:22:10
JOHN WINSLADE A threat. Thank you. Dalia? 

00:22:15
 I'd say that's an active violence, a severe active violence. 

00:22:15
JOHN WINSLADE  Severe active violence, yes. 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you. What would you call from your perspective, Mr. Mitchell? 

00:22:35
 I'd say it was a -- knowing to two girls, I'd say it was a adverse paying to the extreme, an emotional adverse. 

00:22:45
JOHN WINSLADE  An emotional adverse. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:00
JOHN WINSLADE Camrila, what would you say? 

00:23:00
 I would call it a misunderstanding. 

00:23:00
JOHN WINSLADE  Misunderstanding? 

00:23:05
 Yeah. 

00:23:10
[sil.] 

00:23:15
JOHN WINSLADE Ms. Myers? 

00:23:15
 I would say unsafe, disrespectful. 

00:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE Unsafe what? 

00:23:20
  Unsafe problem solving or unsafe response or unsafe interaction. 

00:23:35
JOHN WINSLADE Unsafe interaction, can we stick to that? Unsafe interaction. What you would call it Christina? 

00:23:45
  I would say it's kind of teasing and simple teasing. 

00:23:55
JOHN WINSLADE Simple teasing, thank you. Ms. Bell? 

00:24:00
 I was thinking why -- I'm trying to think of a clean language for it like -- almost like Facebook ridiculousness or Facebook, because I feel like, this is always going on with all of them in Facebook. So like. 

00:24:15
JOHN WINSLADE  So Facebook ridiculousness? 

00:24:20
 Yeah. 

00:24:20
JOHN WINSLADE That's what comes in your mind? 

00:24:20
 Yeah. 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:30
JOHN WINSLADE  So what it has here is a lot of different names for this problem, reflecting each of the different perspectives that you bring to this meeting. And I'm not here to say which one is the correct name, in fact the problem we're here to do with includes all of us, right. So I want to ask you another question and go around the circle again. I'm gonna start with Dalia, because you're the person who is most affected by this, who most directly affected. And the question is, what effect has all of this that happened had on you, what effect has it had on you personally? Dalia, it most directly affected you, what would you say the affect of it all was for you? 

00:25:25
 Well, overall this entire situation has just been hurtful, like I lost my best friend, I don't feel safe walking home anymore like I'm hurt. 

00:25:35
JOHN WINSLADE  Right. Hurtful and don't feel safe. Anything else? 

00:25:45
  No. 

00:25:50
JOHN WINSLADE It's enough for now? 

00:25:50
 Yeah. 

00:25:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. And I think of something else, okay. Ms. Lopez, what would you say? What effect you obviously heard about this from Dalia, is that right? 

00:26:00
 Yes. 

00:26:00
JOHN WINSLADE Or from the school, first. 

00:26:05
 No. I heard it the night that it happened and in the next day to school, met with them. 

00:26:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. And so, what effect did that -- has this whole thing had for you? 

00:26:15
 I was extremely angry. I was extremely disappointed with the school with the behavior of the students, it kills me to see Dalia in so much pain. 

00:26:30
JOHN WINSLADE Disappointed with the school and extremely angry? 

00:26:35
 Yes. 

00:26:35
JOHN WINSLADE  All right. Mr. Mitchell, what would you say the effect of all of this was for you? 

00:26:45
  It's concerning a bit of a major distraction as we were preparing for the false show, like continue to carry on classes normal knowing that children or students were having some conflict. 

00:27:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. So major distraction class as normal. 

00:27:15
 Yes. 

00:27:15
JOHN WINSLADE  Camrila, what effect all of this had for you? 

00:27:20
  Well, I would say, it just makes me extremely sad. I came to the school last year, second semester because like in my high school there is a lot of gossip and stuff, and I was told that it would be a safer environment here and I feel I have kind of let down with all the drama. 

00:27:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, it makes you sad, and it feels like you've been let down with your hopes to coming to the school, right? 

00:27:50
 Yeah. 

00:27:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Ms. Myers, what effect did that all had for you? 

00:27:55
  I'm really disappointed. 

00:28:00
JOHN WINSLADE It kind of speak to more disappointed. 

00:28:00
  I'm disappointed in the posts. I'm disappointed in, you know, the past behavior and disappointed that these two girls were at this place at this point. And it's also this is very exhausting too, because it's very time consuming and this has taken a lot of hours and a big day listening to them and talk with the girls. 

00:28:40
JOHN WINSLADE So it's taking a lot of hours to you. 

00:28:45
 Their parents, yes. 

00:28:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Christina, what effect does all of this -- having all of this having for you? 

00:28:50
  I feel bad that people see me this way and my friend sees me this way. I guess I was just trying to stand and prove myself and everyone taking it as such a bad a thing. 

00:29:10
  You're grounded. 

00:29:15
JOHN WINSLADE  Is that having effects as well for you being grounded? 

00:29:20
  Oh, yeah. My mom is being mad at me. 

00:29:25
JOHN WINSLADE  Mom, mad at me. What effects does it have in your Ms. Bell? 

00:29:35
  Well, I'm gonna lose my job if I take any one time after these meetings. I really have one running at work. In cargos, what's going to happen if I lose my job. 

00:29:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. So all of this is the problem we here to deal with. And as we can see this problem, all of this, is actually affecting many people in one way or another, right. Any comments on what -- what is like to notice, this problem is having these effects? Anyone want to comment on that, you don't have to. But if you do, I might give you a chance to say that. Okay. I'm also going to other circle over here. And the reason for having that is that, this is kind of like one story of what's going wrong. But my guess is that it doesn't ever tell the full story. This is the problem that we're here to deal with, but if we only pay attention to this problem, we might be blind to some other things that we need to also take account of. And, because my guess is this doesn't tell us all we might need to know about Christina, for example, right. So what I want to ask you is that, if you were to think about anything that each of you could tell me about Christina, one thing that they would tell me, I'm just gonna throw this open, I'm not gonna do -- go around the circle this time. One thing you could tell me that does not fit with the story and with the effects of the stories have, and I'm gonna write it either on the side. If anything or one thing that you could think of that doesn't fit with this. 

00:31:45
  I have something. Well, this really -- it kind of surprises me, because last month one of our good friends Mary and her parents, they started going through divorce and it was really hurt on her. 

00:32:10
JOHN WINSLADE On Mary, you mean? 

00:32:10
 Yeah, it's hurt on my friend Mary. And she doesn't really have any really close friends and so Christina stepped in, Christina was there. And we're not very close, but she just helped her, because she was trying to simplify the thought she was going through and like she were there, stayed her house for few weeks and she was really compassionate and I don't know somebody like that can do this. 

00:32:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, if I'm writing and get down here everything that you said? 

00:32:40
  Yeah, I was just saying that she is compassionate and she is very helpful. 

00:32:45
JOHN WINSLADE And what she did that was compassionate that she helped? 

00:32:50
 Yeah. 

00:32:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Yeah, more of the thought came up here. 

00:32:55
 Yeah. 

00:32:55
JOHN WINSLADE When she was what we call, going through a troubling time or what have been the result. 

00:33:10
 Grieving, yeah. 

00:33:10
JOHN WINSLADE Grieving, okay. And Camrila, you tell me what happened, what would say this tells us about Christina if we think about what she did then that doesn't fit with this story, what's that saying then? 

00:33:25
  Well, she is definitely -- she definitely has some compassion in her and she definitely tries to emphasizes with others. 

00:33:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. She has compassion, she emphasizes with others. And when we are not saying that this makes, any of this not true, but this is just also a part of a different story that we also need to take account of, right. Anyone else can tell me anything that you know about Christina that doesn't fit with the story over here. 

00:34:10
  I did recently like this. 

00:34:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Tell me more about what you mean by that. 

00:34:15
  I raised her to be kind towards others and truthful and not getting involved in what she did like this. 

00:34:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So can you give me an example of how she has shown in her actions that she is that you raised her to be kind and concerned about others and truthful. Tell me one story, one example that would help us understand that about Christina. 

00:34:50
  Well, like she does a lot of chores at home. Now, just when she is growing, but sometimes show like do the dishes or (inaudible dinner for us and being more of that kind of person. 

00:35:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so you see her, anything else that would fit with that, or is there anything else to add to this? 

00:35:25
  I guess just things like she will help her brother do homework and yeah, that's all I can think, I remember. 

00:35:35
JOHN WINSLADE  So when you think about Christina, helping her brother's homework, helping you out with things at home, doing the dishes, making dinner for everybody, what does that say about Christina that you can think about what that means? 

00:35:55
 Like, she is a good person. 

00:35:55
JOHN WINSLADE  A good person. Okay, anything else? 

00:36:05
 No. 

00:36:05
JOHN WINSLADE That's all? Okay. Anybody else? 

00:36:05
  One thing I know about Christina is that during our conversation, she is really honest about everything. 

00:36:15
JOHN WINSLADE You mean, when you understanding her? 

00:36:20
 Right. Because most of the time, you know, the student will lie and it happens and several hours getting with us and talking with some others and they didn't have to do much about because she is very honest. 

00:36:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. What does that tell you about her, you're dealing with lots of students, what does that tell you? 

00:36:40
  That's something like you can trust her. 

00:36:45
JOHN WINSLADE She is kind of trustworthy? 

00:36:45
  Yeah. 

00:36:50
JOHN WINSLADE  Trustworthy, right. What else? Anyone else? 

00:36:55
  Yeah, well. What that say to me, it was first like unsafe interaction and that has been -- have joined to see that when I think to last year, she was helping her former classmate, Jessie, who was struggling to -- just pin out her lines for the performance. 

00:37:20
JOHN WINSLADE For the production? 

00:37:20
  Yeah. And Christina and one of my top students just jumped in and aided her where she didn't need to spending class hours after her classes, going as so far and meet with us and school and helped Jessie do really good job on her production. 

00:37:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And what is that suggesting you about Christina that she did this for Jessie? 

00:37:55
  She is a caring individual. 

00:38:00
JOHN WINSLADE Caring individual. 

00:38:00
  Selfless, being the star of that, she need to reach down and help Jessie. 

00:38:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Caring individual and selfless. Dalia, you -- my understanding is you two manage yourself quite well, right? 

00:38:25
 Right. 

00:38:25
JOHN WINSLADE Is there anything that you know about Christina that doesn't fit with this story here that has been such a problem for you. 

00:38:30
  Actually, this entire thing was a bit of a surprise. Christina and I have been friends since eighth grade. And she helped me a lot during my engineering, during my 15th birthday. She was never late any in the practices. She helped me pick up my dress. 

00:39:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So known her for eight years and helped me during concerned years, is that what you said? 

00:39:20
 Yes. The 15th birthday. 

00:39:20
JOHN WINSLADE 15th birthday, okay. So when you say it was a surprise almost for you, although this problem had happened, this is like you knew her as a different person before this. 

00:39:40
 Right. 

00:39:40
JOHN WINSLADE And how did you say that you know her? I'm writing what you just said. What that say about Christina. 

00:39:50
 Christina is always been like a sister to me. She is really helpful and I need that always, I can't have that's going through anything. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE This is that. Is that okay? Thank you everybody. 

00:40:05
  Let me add. 

00:40:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:40:10
 Because I -- what she said about being shocked, I share the same feeling on the way here that we were talking on the car, how -- I was still in this belief what had happened, I was really, really upset, because what I've known from Christina is that, because that one time that you went -- she want take us to a concert, and she didn't even think that she was going to pick her in. All of a sudden, she came and said, I want to take you to the concert and I know how happy she was. So she seem like she would be a very loyal friend. 

00:40:40
JOHN WINSLADE So she shared -- said that to concert and what that shows you about is that she can be very much a loyal friend. Is that fair enough? 

00:40:55
  Yes. 

00:41:00
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you. So we've got two stories and I'm not saying either one is the only story or the true story. They are both of trues about them that she must know these things we indicated right. Christina I'm gonna ask you something. If you look at both of these two stories, this one here which is a problem that we're here to deal with and these other things that people know about you that don't fit with that problem. Which one in future would you like to be the story that everybody knows about you, I think, goes forward from this meeting? 

00:41:35
  The right one. 

00:41:40
JOHN WINSLADE This one here? Thank you. Okay. Can I ask you to say why? 

00:41:40
  That just seems like -- that's how people see me and that's a good thing, if I was the last one, I won't really like myself, people saw me out there. 

00:41:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So you don't want to see you this way, because it would leave you to not like yourself, right. And you much more would like you to see in this way right? Thank you. So that leads us with the need to workout how we can get this story to be the one that goes forward and this story just deal with so that it doesn't actually go forward from this meeting, it doesn't continue, right. And that's how people see it. So what I'm going to ask is, we're running out a little bit space here in the board. What I'm gonna ask is, for any thoughts that any of you had about what would help this story to be the future story about Christina particularly in relation to Dalia. And I'm gonna start with you Dalia, because you are the person who is most directly affected, I'm gonna also ask you Mr. Mitchell to speak to this as well. What do you need Dalia to make sure that this problem here all the story goes away and this story here is the one that you had a chance to know about Christina and you here. what do you think? 

00:43:15
 Okay. Well, for me, a big thing is just apologizing. You haven't given me a single hint there, you are sorry for this. You dispute our friendship on the line, I think it didn't matter. 

00:43:30
JOHN WINSLADE  So for you one thing, you will need would be an apology, right. 

00:43:40
 Right. 

00:43:40
 I'm sorry. It's great to now, but how we will know is not going to happen again. Saying apologies and all is great, but how can we be sure that she is going to be safe and this is not going to happen again? 

00:43:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. That's an important question, right. And maybe you either of you should have any ideas like what will help you to feel like I don't know at this moment, whether Christina is willing to offer an apology rather. And good, we have to write and give her a chance that to respond to that. But I'm here and you would like something a little more than an apology? 

00:44:20
 Absolutely. 

00:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE  And what you're saying is, you would like to know that it's not going to happen again? 

00:44:25
 Right. 

00:44:25
JOHN WINSLADE  What do you think would give you the security or the assurance? 

00:44:30
  At this point, I'm not sure. 

00:44:40
JOHN WINSLADE You're not sure. 

00:44:40
 It frights me that this happened through the Facebook. 

00:44:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:44:45
 So I don't know it's something with having to monitor that, the Facebook posts or whatever they were doing in Facebook or having the teachers or the concerts and things. 

00:45:00
JOHN WINSLADE So that's one idea that you might come up with, some kind of monitoring, is that right? 

00:45:05
 Yes. 

00:45:05
JOHN WINSLADE Dalia, you want to speak to this? What would give you a sense of security that your brother is speaking about that this is not going to happen again. 

00:45:15
 I think monitoring Facebook would be fine, but when Christina and I was close as we were, she wasn't like this, there was no chances she is going to hurt me. And I feel like we go back there and we fix that. I will feel safe. 

00:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. If things were to go back in terms of your friendship to where they were, right? 

00:45:40
 Right. 

00:45:40
JOHN WINSLADE What will need to happen for you in order to pretend to that place? 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
 Want to know that I forgive her and she forgives me. I know that we've had problems and stuff. But it's not worth losing our friendship. 

00:46:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, forgiveness might help. But we don't know whether that's something that people has to choose so often. You may have to choose whether you guys willing to offer that. It's meaning to Christina or someone else. Anything else that you will need that would give you a feeling of being back to where things used to be? 

00:46:30
  I don't know. Yeah. I guess that's it. 

00:46:35
JOHN WINSLADE  That's it for now. Okay. You may come back with something else in that. And Christina, I want to invite you to speak to this point, right. Do you have any ideas about what's going to make this story with the one that's known more about you that people actually think of you this way as you said rather than this problem story. What do you think would help you to restore things back to really to the best. 

00:47:05
 I guess, I would be willing to apologize to Dalia, if she would be willing to apologize to me for making me like do right and everything. It's just been a lot of drama, and we started drifting, because she came and stole my boyfriend, who I was going out for like four -- almost five months. And she started talking to him without me knowing about it. And I guess I was just really mad at her for doing that, because I trusted her. But I would be willing to apologize, because I need that something that I want to lose her friendship over. 

00:48:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So the friendship is important to you too, right. And that's more important than other things that would interfere with losing that friendship. Is that fair enough? 

00:48:10
 Yeah. 

00:48:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. So for that purpose, you're willing to apologize. For what exactly Christina? 

00:48:20
 For writing some -- such on Facebook that could be taken badly. 

00:48:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Do you want to do that now or what would be a way for that to happen, like it has to be spoken or written or witnessed or what do you think either of you? 

00:48:45
  I think saying it like getting it in the air, I'm sorry and I honestly okay, again. 

00:48:55
  I'm sorry too, for writing and stuff. I won't hurt you. 

00:49:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And you had a question about whether you can trust this right? 

00:49:15
 Yes. 

00:49:15
 And I want to come back to that question for you Christina. If you're willing to give that apology, how might you show Dalia that you are sincere in making that apology? What would you saying? How will you show it and perhaps so that she could trust that, so just everybody going to actually understand that this is not going to happen again. 

00:49:40
 I guess there is no way unless you both trust me, but I would be willing to apologize to you here whole family if that is necessary and I would just stop maybe going on Facebook for a while just to get away from all of that. 

00:50:05
JOHN WINSLADE  How does that sound like? 

00:50:10
 Sounds much good. 

00:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Why is that helps? What was helpful about it? 

00:50:15
  Because Facebook was what she has right. 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE  So how long would you remain that she was to carrying through with her intention there. How long would you say that she needs to do that before you could feel like she was sincere in the apology? 

00:50:35
  Part of it says through rest of the year, school year, now it just started. We're knowing that Facebook is really popular, I think a couple months. 

00:50:50
JOHN WINSLADE Couple months? 

00:50:50
 And even if afterwards, if any misbehavior, can keep track of that afterwards, I think that would be ideal. If you have any work. 

00:51:00
JOHN WINSLADE So there is a proposal, how that's sound to you? Is that fit with what you are offering? 

00:51:05
 Yeah, that's what it will take to people about my virtue. 

00:51:10
JOHN WINSLADE Two months, is that right? 

00:51:10
 Yeah. And I'm going to be that. 

00:51:15
JOHN WINSLADE And you are asking also that Ms. Bell has a pardon monitoring that. 

00:51:20
 Yes. 

00:51:20
 I mean, I can watch your Facebook and I know she took it a new level here, but they go back and forth on Facebook all the time. So I know she took it to a new level, I meant that. I'm just saying they go back and forth, I'm willing to look at, I'm willing to monitoring. 

00:51:40
JOHN WINSLADE You're willing to monitoring. 

00:51:40
 I mean, if so, let me look at her Facebook, on her Facebook. 

00:51:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:51:40
 Yeah. 

00:51:40
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. Ms. Myers, just on that point, how would the school know that this is happening that so you could feel that the school could trust that this is actually changing and dealing with the situation. 

00:52:00
  I'm wondering if maybe these girls need counseling, because it sounds like they were surprise that these things were major incidents, and there was harassment and bulling and that it was really, really serious. So I don't know if maybe we could thought about counseling and then we can learn some friendship skills. 

00:52:35
JOHN WINSLADE  Well, it sounds like this is a particular issue, that's risen between you, that comes alive as we talking about this and who raised this, Christina, right? And if you said you would like something from Dalia as well. What was that there? Will you speak to that again? 

00:52:55
 I just worried about apology that she gave me I guess may be if we were both just stop going around Facebook to kind of see, to kind of not be caught up in that drama and to know that she is not going to behind my back talking about me there on the Facebook. 

00:53:15
  So, that will be important to you that it's not just happening back in reverse to you. Dalia is not doing the same kind of thing in Facebook to you. What would you say to that, Dalia? 

00:53:30
 I think that's fine. I'm willing to exit Facebook that she is for me. 

00:53:35
JOHN WINSLADE  You're right. Okay. You also mentioned the issue of your boyfriend, your former boyfriend. 

00:53:45
 No, it's her boyfriend. 

00:53:45
 It's her boyfriend. And I would like to be willing to offer that we actually have a conversation that two of you together with me and we try and address that issue and that's kind of thing that you were asking for some counseling. 

00:54:05
 You are right. 

00:54:05
JOHN WINSLADE Are you two willing to be part of that and trying to solve that up? 

00:54:10
 Yeah sure. 

00:54:10
JOHN WINSLADE  Alright. Now, you were wondering this morning in the Facebook as if your suggestion Ms. Myers, that's right? 

00:54:20
  Yes. 

00:54:25
 Are you happy with what we've talked about that's being the way that's going to happen or is there anything else that you think needs to happen to that. 

00:54:30
 What you said, Ms. Bell, I'm willing to also take correct and done some -- monitoring her Facebook when she says go back on it, something that. 

00:54:40
JOHN WINSLADE So you guys will monitor each of their Facebook right. And can I may be check with you after may be the first couple of weeks and then hearing after a couple of months to see that it has been happening right. Is that okay if I give you a call or a phone (inaudible ) for another meeting? 

00:55:02
  Okay, thank you. Sure. 

00:55:05
JOHN WINSLADE Is that okay if I ask you on the phone as well? 

00:55:05
  That's fine. 

00:55:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:55:10
JOHN WINSLADE What else. I don't know, Mr. Mitchell, whether you have anything else or Camrila, whether you have anything else that you would like to see to make sure that this is the story that goes forward? 

00:55:20
 (inaudible ) I didn't see how I could facilitate thing, within -- how things for our classroom, we see them rectifying this friendship. 

00:55:35
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:55:35
 Because they have -- there was some awesome parents, who is looking me to do, I want to say to them, they don't want react to that. 

00:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE You want to get back to that? 

00:55:45
 Yeah. 

00:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Any thoughts about what would be necessarily to get back to that person onside between? 

00:55:50
  That will be counseling. And them to see now that you are now discussing whatever issue that everyone is rolling. 

00:56:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. It's get it back to how things work, so that you can do your best on stage, important to both of you. You both? 

00:56:10
 Yeah. 

00:56:10
JOHN WINSLADE So maybe that's part of what we will talk about when we need to get the two. Okay. 

00:56:20
 Okay. 

00:56:20
JOHN WINSLADE And anything else from you Camrila that you want to see happen? 

00:56:20
  Well, I think it's really important that they do apologize to each other and I think they should both apologize and I think that they should kind of watch how they act to each other at school. Because like since, what Cristiana actually did in October on Facebook, since it was done as well as public, so much of our classmates kind of started talking about it. And so, I think it's really important to be respectful of each other in public and just curse the person isn't there doesn't mean that you should be able to gossip about them behind the back. So this you should know that. 

00:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE So this has actually affected other people? 

00:57:10
 Yeah. 

00:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. And you're the person who is representing the other people here today. 

00:57:15
 Yeah. Well, because I wasn't really -- I was getting to be really close friends of both of them. So I was new to the school and they were both really nice to me and started talking here and then like all of a sudden over the summer, they just I don't know what happened, I don't like it. 

00:57:30
JOHN WINSLADE  So, this all thing is put even in a difficult place in relation to two friends, right? 

00:57:35
 Yeah. Because I want to -- but then like it happened, Dalia called me up and she was crying. She told me about it and like we've did it -- like Christina did and then I kind of didn't really know and want betray one of them and saw, it couldn't feel like talk to Christina, then after Dalia and vice versa. So it's kind ruined my friendship, I always rarely with both of them. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE  Christina and Dalia, any response you want to make to what Camrila is just saying? 

00:58:05
  I didn't' know this situation was affecting other people. So sorry for that. It wasn't my intention to like out her friendship. 

00:58:20
  I am sorry Camrila, I didn't know that it was like affecting you or even my teacher, like that would stress the teacher and other people. I didn't think that it would kill that much. And I truly escape Facebook. 

00:58:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Thank you everybody. And I appreciate, Camrila, this is something else has not directly involved you or a member of your family, like everybody else here. And you've been willing to come along as a friend to both of these people. So thank you for doing that. 

00:59:00
 Sure. 

00:59:00
JOHN WINSLADE  Ms. Myers, if all these things happen. So, I think we got a plan here with everyone, is that right. Anybody have any problems with the plan? So, Ms. Myers, if this all happens, how does that meets requirements of the school for this issue being dealt with, because that was the reason then we called the meeting. 

00:59:25
 Well, if those things happen and we can resolve this in a peaceful way and the girls agree to do, fall through of what, you know, the plan, then we can alarm, can grow that safe. But if, you know, these things continue, then I mean, this behavior can reach in someone getting suspended or even expelled. 

00:59:50
JOHN WINSLADE  So, you're wanting to see this happens, so that doesn't get to that level. 

01:00:00
 Yeah. I need to see someone gets suspended or expelled from the school. Good girls, and I want them to stay at our school and be peaceful and get well and get back to things.

JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well, thank you everybody. I think we are nearly done here. And what I can see here is that we have a plan for what's gonna happen. And my invitation to everybody is to make sure that this plan happens. And I see that I have a role to help to make sure that it happens. And the two parents have a role to make sure that -- guardians I should say, a role to make sure that it happens. And Dalia and Christina, you have a role to make sure that this happens. And Mr. Mitchell is trying to pay attentions to seeing that it happens on stage and in drama, right. And Camrila, you have a role to also be conscious of what's happening and to support the change this story being one or other people read to know about, right. Then, may be anyone else who wants to see the drama continue, gets to know that you people have decided that it's going to stop. And so, I'm going to undertake to check in with you as I see it, to make sure that these things are shifting and changing. I would also caution that, you know, given what's happened, it's not necessarily going to be instant that you two are best friends again. This is gonna take a little bit of time and a little bit of work. And I'm willing to talk with you through that work, but I really appreciate the fact that you are committing yourselves to doing so. And Ms. Myers, I will communicate with you to make sure that, you know, and we're still saying that in a month's time and again in two month's time, this is still working towards the resolution that we have talked about. 

01:02:00
 It sounds good. 

01:02:00
JOHN WINSLADE Is it okay with you? Thank you. So thank you everybody, and anybody like to comment on what we've done here today and it has been for everybody. 

01:02:10
 It's been good to see, I mean, given that genuine apology between the two of them, it's very exciting to see that. 

01:02:20
JOHN WINSLADE  That makes a difference for you to see that? 

01:02:25
 Yeah. I think I'm impressed to see them look at each other. 

01:02:30
JOHN WINSLADE Anybody else? 

01:02:30
 It's been really helpful definitely, because I wouldn't have been able to say what I have to say if I wasn't for this meeting. 

01:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Thank you. 

01:02:40
 I still feel little bit upset. 

01:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE  Yes. 

01:02:45
 And I feel much better that things being done about it. 

01:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:02:50
 Now, we have the space that we can discuss this. 

01:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So feelings of being upset don't just disappear immediately. And disappear as people show that they are willing to make all those things happen, right? So, I understand when you say you still feel a bit upset right. Maybe other do as well, right. Anybody else got any comments about what we've done here today? 

01:03:05
  So, I'm happy that we can do this instead of, you know, someone getting suspended or, you know,. more detentions or explosion for me. Hope, I'll see till my office. At least not for problem. 

01:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE For other reasons. 

01:03:30
 Yeah. 

01:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. Well, thank you and I'll see you again very shortly, in fact, I'll give too an appointment before we leave. And just stay back in right time when everybody else is on their way, okay? Thank you, Mrs. Bell for coming in. Thank you Mr. Lopez for coming in. And thank you for staying after school. And thank you girls for your willingness to address the session, which is so important to each of you. And that's not finished, but you've done a great step -- taken a great step forward in dealing with it today. Thanks.
