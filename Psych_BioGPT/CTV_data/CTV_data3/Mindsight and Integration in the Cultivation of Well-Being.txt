Mindsight and Integration in the Cultivation of Well-Being 

00:00:55
Daniel Siegel, MD 

00:00:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Well, it is an honor to be here with you today. Can everyone hear in the back? Yes? Great. It is an honor to be here with you, and thank you all for coming. This is a clinical demonstration of a mindsight approach to psychotherapy, and we are going to be drawing on a field of knowing called Interpersonal Neurobiology. And, um, the last time I did this, four years ago, uh, I didn't realize it was a clinical demonstration, because I had never done one in front of an audience like this, uh, and someone was sitting up here and they said, "Okay, this is a clinical demo, Dan.", and I said "What's that?". And I had never seen one. So I did one. I demonstrated what we do clinically in interpersonal neurobiology, using mindsight, which is the ability to sense energy and information flow within your own body, within your relationships with others, and learning not only to sense that flow, but to be able to shape that flow toward well-being, and in our field, interpersonal neurobiology we have a concept called integration, which is the linkage of differentiated parts and we have a whole system for doing clinical evaluation and clinical intervention based on this model. So, as you can see, the person who volunteered today is invisible, and he and she have been really graciously cooperative to come. So when I came today they said "Are you doing a clinical demo?" and I remembered what I felt 4 years ago, which was "What's that?", so then I thought, well, no maybe we are not doing a clinical demo, but actually we are. So what I am going to do is give you like a 5-minute overview of the clinical process so that as I am doing that, with full informed consent, I guess this is what you are supposed to do in this setting, which I find very odd, but maybe this is what we’re all here for, someone can volunteer to come up actually and do that, and the volunteer here has your life savings you are going to give all to the evolution of psychotherapy conference and they have a form you need to fill out, but what I would suggest is you wait till you hear what is going on. But there is someone anxious to volunteer, she is not going to wait, so if your are anxious to do it, then here is our volunteer and here is another volunteer, and I don't know, I'll leave it up to you, I'm not going to participate in the choice, so you can prick(ph) 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible )go first. 

00:03:27
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, whatever she does, I’m, um, it’s not me, it’s the red hat person. So, while she is taking care of all the details of signing things and all that, what I am going to do is just give you an overview, but before I do let me just give you where you get the background. We have now the Norton series, which I am the founding editor of, has 15 textbooks of interpersonal neurobiology, synthesizing science for the clinician. And so, if you haven't seen our series they have some of the books here at the bookstore. You can always come to the Mindsight Institute booth here where we have people from the Institute who can talk to you about interpersonal neurobiology. There’s online courses and things and with email lists and that kind of stuff. There is also a nonprofit organization you can join called GAINS, or the Global Association for Interpersonal Neurobiology Studies, and their website is mindgains.org, and it is a wonderful group of people in this nonprofit setting to really look at how to apply interpersonal neurobiology in psychotherapy, schools, uh religion, uh family life, including parenting, and business. And so, there is, there’s all that richness is there and there are programs like our program to train you in that at a distance or if you are in Los Angeles, close up. So the books that I will be referring to mostly are the mindsight book, which will be out in January, in general, but here in this conference they were able to secure a certain number of books. This is a book that applies interpersonal neurobiology and the idea of mindsight to case-by-case histories. Each of the chapters in the clinical application part of the book is a detailed example of what I hope you'll be able to see up here on the stage, so if at the end of this hour you are interested in more, the mindsight book is a place, and then in May The Mindful Therapist will come out, which applies not only the ideas of mindsight but also the ideas from the book that is already out, The Mindful Brain, to how we ourselves can develop the kind of presence that metaanalyses of psychotherapy show is an extremely important component of effective psychotherapy. So what you will see me do here, I guess the volunteers have taken off, so maybe I will do it by myself, or are they - oh, here you are, so let's here it for our volunteer for volunteering. 

00:06:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yes, hi how are you? 

00:06:00
BELLA Good thank you. 

00:06:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Good. Now you can say your actual name or you don't have to, but as you know, this is being taped so it is gonna be for distribution from the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference, right? So you’re 

00:06:10
BELLA (inaudible )microphone 

00:06:14
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You don't have a microphone yet. Okay, good. So here's a microphone for you. So you know that this is all public, you don't think this is a private consultation, right? You never know, you have to ask and be explicit with everything. So clearly, and I want to make sure our volunteer hears this, so let me wait for a moment, because in the flow of attention, of course, generally we have one channel that when its conscious focal attention processes things through an area called the hippocampus and gets embedded into what is called explicit memory, and I want to make sure explicitly you know that. So welcome to the stage. Let's hear it again for our volunteer. I'm Dan. 

00:06:55
BELLA I'm Bella. 

00:07:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Bella, nice to meet you. 

00:07:00
BELLA You too. 

00:07:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So we've never met before 

00:07:00
BELLA No. 

00:07:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD But you're actually my cousin. No. 

00:07:05
BELLA No. Perhaps. 

00:07:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD This is a total setup, you always wonder about that. So Bella, now you know this is public, yeah, and thank you for volunteering, I appreciate it. 

00:07:10
BELLA Your welcome. 

00:07:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So you want to, which seat would you prefer? 

00:07:15
BELLA This one. 

00:07:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, great, wonderful, thank you. And just get yourself comfortable. So you know, this is, we have about 50 minutes to spend together, and the purpose of this, of course, is to demonstrate what might be done clinically. So you know, I don't know how you feel but I feel very nervous. How are you feeling? 

00:07:35
BELLA Heart rate is up. 

00:07:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah. 

00:07:35
BELLA Yeah. 

00:07:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, good. So this is an extremely unusual clinical setting, right? Do you, are you a therapist? 

00:07:45
BELLA I am currently doing my practicum. 

00:07:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You are doing your practicum? 

00:07:45
BELLA Yes. 

00:07:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So you are in training to be a therapist? 

00:07:50
BELLA Yes. 

00:07:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Great. How has that been going? 

00:07:50
BELLA Wonderful. 

00:07:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wonderful, good. So this is really incredible to come to the evolution meeting and see this, and I appreciate you volunteering. So as you know, or as you are going to soon learn from becoming a therapist, this is an extremely unusual setting for doing any kind of therapeutic encounter, right, with I don't know how many thousands of people are here, but it's a big, it's unusual. So we are going to have an experience but afterwards you and I can chat about things that, if anything comes up that feels uncomfortable, we can talk a little more about it and where you could go for more exploration. 

00:08:20
BELLA Okay, thank you. 

00:08:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. So the idea here, of course, is to explore what’s going on with you, because clearly you volunteered, and there is two ways we can do it, and I want to check in with you about how you would like to do it. We can just do what we are going to do and talk about it afterwards up here for everyone to share, or as we go I can stop and teach you and everyone else why I did what I did as we go. So, but it's up to you because this is your hour. And you can even think about it and change midcourse however you want to do it, but I want to make sure this is really good for you, because this is really for you. 

00:09:05
BELLA I am thinking what would be most useful for the audience. 

00:09:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah, but 

00:09:10
BELLA for learning wise 

00:09:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD That's okay, they'll, they’re, yeah. 

00:09:10
BELLA Yeah. 

00:09:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD But think about yourself. Is that something that happens a lot, you think about other people first? 

00:09:15
BELLA Absolutely. 

00:09:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Did you ever think about becoming a psychotherapist? 

00:09:20
BELLA I did at one time. 

00:09:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah. 

00:09:25
BELLA Umhm. 

00:09:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. 

00:09:25
BELLA You know, I'm not fussed, either way. 

00:09:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. 

00:09:25
BELLA Either way is fine. 

00:09:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You're not fussed? 

00:09:30
BELLA Umhm. 

00:09:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Good, I love that term. Can I use that term, I'm not fussed? 

00:09:30
BELLA Absolutely. 

00:09:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD I love that. Okay. All right. Well I hope this won't be a fussing kind of thing we are going to do. Okay, so we will just see how it goes, you're good either way? 

00:09:35
BELLA Umhm. 

00:09:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So let's just see how it goes. 

00:09:40
BELLA Okay. 

00:09:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So the idea in general of the way we do work is we think of a triangle and we think of relationships, like the one we are just beginning to set up between you, Bella, and me, Dan, and they are here too so, you are here too, so, and them as well, but we are going to try and make this focused here, and, do you want to move your chair around, is that? 

00:10:00
BELLA No, I am just becoming more open. 

00:10:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, great. And, so, maybe you should interview me, I like that, your style. So, um, I'll get myself more open too. So, um, so, we think of a triangle of relationships, the mind and the brain, and in our work what we are looking for is basically how these capacities to have energy and information flow, which is the way we think in this field, uh, this mindsight field, of seeing how energy and information flow is gonna happen between us, how we share that, so already you have shared to me that you think about others and you know your feeling in your body you want to be open, and so we are sharing that with each other, and then the brain part is really the extended nervous system, from your toes to your nose, the whole body really is what we mean when we say brain, and we are going to look at certain mechanisms of the brain that allow this energy and information to flow. So the brain is the mechanism of flow, relationships is the sharing, and then we look at mind, which is actually this ability to regulate the flow. And, we may do some exercises, you and me, during this time, to see how you can sense energy and information flow and maybe I’ll teach you a technique to sense it more clearly and then to actually shape it in a certain fashion which I’ll talk about a little later, but it’s called integration. 

00:11:25
BELLA Okay. 

00:11:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Right. So the first thing I am going to ask you, and this is a really broad question if you were coming for therapy, is I would say, you know, what brings you here? And in this setting I could say how did, what brought your hand to go up so quickly to come up on this stage? 

00:11:40
BELLA I felt that participating in a demonstration would fulfill my experience of coming to the Evolution of Psychotherapy. 

00:11:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Beautiful, so you wanted to fulfill an experience of immersing yourself? 

00:11:50
BELLA Umhm. 

00:11:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah, okay, great. And is there anything in particular when you were feeling that desire for fulfillment that you were hoping that by the end of this hour you would experience? Do you have expectations on perhaps what you are looking for? 

00:12:05
BELLA Getting to know myself a little bit better. 

00:12:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, so getting, getting to know yourself. 

00:12:10
BELLA Umhm. 

00:12:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD In any particular kind of way? 

00:12:15
BELLA I think just maybe some more insight into why I do what I do. 

00:12:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Okay, great. So, um, let’s see how that goes. 

00:12:25
BELLA Okay. 

00:12:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD I hope, I hope we can achieve that. So the first thing in this view, in this mindsight view is we look for is I am going to ask you just about how your life is going, and if we had more open kind of time and we weren’t trying to demonstrate stuff for the other part of our relationship, the thousands out there, what I would do is I would ask you more open-ended questions, but here they are going to be a little more specific, just for time efficiency. So I am going to ask you, if you reflect on your life, where your are at now in your life, literally here in the moment, but things where you think about your immediate past or more distant past and when you think about where you are going in the future, are there moments when things feel really stuck and rigid and are there times in your life, in contrast, where they are filled with chaos and unpredictability? 

00:13:20
[sil.] 

00:13:20
BELLA Right now I do not feel stuck because I am currently doing my masters and I am doing my clinical practicum, so there is a lot of movement and a lot of growth. I actually feel like I am in one of the biggest growth periods of my life at the moment. 

00:13:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. And that growth period feels how? 

00:13:35
BELLA At times it is overwhelming, it’s stressful, but it’s also really exciting. 

00:13:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Okay, so there doesn’t sound like there is much stuckness or rigidity there. 

00:13:45
BELLA No. 

00:13:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And when it gets overwhelming and stressful, does it feel like it gets chaotic, that it’s unpredictable, that it’s flooding you in ways that are not helpful? 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:05
BELLA I would say so, yes. 

00:14:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. Can you bring to mind a moment when things were particularly chaotic like that, what was going on and what it felt like? 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:20
BELLA It would be when I was with a client and I felt that I didn’t have enough experience to be helpful to her in her situation, so it was really out of my competence level. 

00:14:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. And what did it feel like inside your body at that moment when you were with her. It was a female patient? 

00:14:40
BELLA Yes it was. 

00:14:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:14:45
BELLA I was actually scared, because I believe it was more of a psychiatric issue than it was a counseling issue. 

00:14:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So you had a feeling a fear 

00:14:55
BELLA Umhm 

00:14:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD That came up inside you. And what happened with that fear at that moment? 

00:15:00
BELLA Well, I held it together and I completed the session, but I didn’t book for the next session, in the end I talked to a colleague about it. 

00:15:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. And how did that go, the talk? 

00:15:10
BELLA It went well, um, my instinct was to talk to my boss, but because it was a Friday afternoon I, I sat with it and by the time I came back to work, which was the following Wednesday, I had sort of looked at all my different options and then I realized I do need to go talk to my boss, I couldn’t take it to my supervisor because there was many layers of complications. 

00:15:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm, okay. So we are going to try to stay with the fear. 

00:15:50
BELLA Umhm. 

00:15:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And you know in this overall approach what we are going to do is then say, at that moment, in any of our experiences when something comes up like fear of course it’s in that moment you felt like this patient may have had some issues, you are calling them psychiatric, that were beyond your level of competence, so what we want to do is let the fear be present right now, in your awareness, if you can bring that up from that time, and what I am gonna ask you to do is just see whatever comes to mind about the fear then and any kind of connections that come up in your body, any place you feel it, let’s start there. 

00:16:25
BELLA Okay, I feel it in my chest. 

00:16:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Can you show me where? 

00:16:30
BELLA Around here. 

00:16:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Right there. And what does it feel like in your chest? 

00:16:30
BELLA Tightness. 

00:16:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD A tightness. Okay. So if you let yourself, just in your awareness, let the tightness in your chest just fill your awareness right now, and just let it go wherever it goes. 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:16:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And what do you experience? 

00:17:10
BELLA It is not as intense in my chest, but it has also moved lower to my stomach as well as higher to my shoulders. 

00:17:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. And what does it feel like in your stomach and your shoulders? 

00:17:20
BELLA A heaviness. 

00:17:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. That’s distributed now across there? 

00:17:25
BELLA Yeah, so it’s not as intense in the chest but it’s still heavy going up and down. 

00:17:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Okay. And if you stay with that sensation, see where that goes right now. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:40
BELLA It’s vanishing. 

00:17:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD It’s getting less. 

00:17:55
BELLA Umhm. 

00:17:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. So as it vanishes, now I am going to invite you to see if there are any images that come to your mind. And this is something we do and is as a training in therapy, we call it sifting the mind, S-I-F-T, so beginning with the bodily sensations, the S, and then letting any images come to your mind, so it’s just to explore that, anything at all and you don’t need to filter them, just see whatever pops up into your mind’s eye. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:30
BELLA So I see colors. 

00:18:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Colors. 

00:18:55
BELLA Colors. 

00:18:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD What kind of colors? 

00:19:00
BELLA So the colors were changing, it started with a green, and then it went to a blue, and then a gray, and then orange. 

00:19:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:19:05
BELLA Umhm, as well as equestrian. 

00:19:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Equestrian horses? 

00:19:10
BELLA Yes. So I saw, um, an arena with white fences that the horses jump over and I didn’t see anyone riding the horses but I did see the horses going over their obstacles. 

00:19:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD They were jumping? 

00:19:30
BELLA Yes. 

00:19:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, okay, great. And how did that feel as you saw the colors and the horses jumping and the equestrian image? 

00:19:35
BELLA The colors were very familiar, but the horses were unique. 

00:19:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Were unique. Okay. And I noticed, just so you know, that your eyes were moving back and forth a lot when you were going through that. And so with this feeling of the uniqueness of the horses, what, what comes to your mind, what, anything at all, what connections come to that? 

00:19:55
BELLA  Well, I was recently in Santa Barbara and I saw the, pretty much the image that I saw in my mind a few days ago, but there was no horses on the weekend, so when I told you what the horses were doing, jumping over obstacles, that is really what this experience was for me, it was me needing to jump over this obstacle and being able to handle it. 

00:20:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm, okay, great. And you saw that they could actually jump. 

00:20:30
BELLA Umhm, yeah, they cleared it. 

00:20:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm, they cleared it. 

00:20:30
BELLA Yeah. 

00:20:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Good, good. And you have a smile on your face. And how does it feel in your body right this moment? 

00:20:35
BELLA It feels like I am able to clear the obstacles that come up in my life. 

00:20:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm, umhm. So let’s go with that sense of obstacles. 

00:20:45
BELLA Okay. 

00:20:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And now, if it is okay with you, and I should just say that if ever there is a moment when I am asking you something and you don’t feel like disclosing it to me or if there is anyone else listening, then you don’t need to at all. 

00:20:55
BELLA Okay. 

00:20:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So I’ll feel free to ask you whatever if I know that you feel free to say I’m not going to answer that. Does that, does that sound good? 

00:21:05
BELLA Sure. 

00:21:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, thanks. So what I would like you to do is when you think about obstacles in your life, and now we are going from your present experience in your body, your history of encountering this client, and now we are going to go way back from the time you were born to now and I am going to ask you to let your awareness just bring into anything from your history that has to do with fear and obstacles. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:40
BELLA Okay. 

00:22:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Good and what comes to mind? 

00:22:10
BELLA I think getting into situations and always problem-solving my way out of them. 

00:22:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Getting yourself into situations as a kid, or when did you mean? 

00:22:20
BELLA Yeah, as a child as well as as a teenager, yeah, throughout my life, but always finding a way to solve my own problems. 

00:22:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So you were successful at jumping over the hurdles? 

00:22:30
BELLA Yes, as uncomfortable as they may have been. 

00:22:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
BELLA Yeah. 

00:22:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. And when you think about those uncomfortable experiences you had to encounter, do any stand out to you as still holding on to your inner world in some way that feels not free and easy? 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:00
BELLA Honestly, no. I feel like I have been able to resolve. 

00:23:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Okay, so nothing, you can’t imagine any of those particular actual experiences that still have a lasting effect on you? 

00:23:30
[sil] 

00:23:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD  Okay. That’s, that’s a very powerful realization. So when you approach the obstacle of your training and this sense of maybe it is beyond my competence and you felt a little anxiety about that, maybe fear even, as you call it, what comes to your mind about the need to know? How comfortable are you with uncertainty? 

00:24:15
BELLA I used to be very uncomfortable with it, but in the past couple of years I have become a lot more accepting about it. 

00:24:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:24:25
BELLA Umhm. I think especially in this field you need to- 

00:24:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yes. 

00:24:30
BELLA embrace ambiguity. 

00:24:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Right, ambiguity is certainly something, and even the ability to say I don’t know and that doesn’t make you incompetent. 

00:24:40
BELLA Umhm. 

00:24:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Right. So I am wondering if there is anything from the way you were brought up in your family that put knowing as something very important in your role in the family? 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:00
BELLA I think so. 

00:25:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, can you share what your family setup was like, you know, where you grew up and who was in the family and things like that? 

00:25:10
BELLA Okay. So I grew up in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia. 

00:25:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD My favorite town. 

00:25:15
BELLA And, um, there was 6 of us in our family, my mother and my father, an older sister, myself was second, then I had a younger sister and my brother was the youngest, and I believe that I was glue that held everything together, and I still am. 

00:25:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:25:35
BELLA I hold the birthday parties, I host the, if we were to have a holiday celebration it would be at my house. 

00:25:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. And could you, and we are going to get into that in a little more detail. But right now, how do you, what do you sense in your body? And just without articulating just let yourself be present in your body as you’re describing this history to us, just let yourself be aware of whatever you feel. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And what, what did you experience? 

00:26:25
BELLA So I felt pressure, being the glue. 

00:26:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Pressure, where do you feel that now, in? 

00:26:30
BELLA Again in my chest. 

00:26:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD In your chest, uh-huh. 

00:26:30
BELLA Umhm. But I also felt pleasure, because I think, I think it’s a nice role to have. 

00:26:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Important role for the family, huh? 

00:26:35
BELLA Yeah. 

00:26:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah. So the glue, in a way, if I am beginning to understand it is to really keep people together. That’s what you mean by glue, to? 

00:26:45
BELLA Umhm. I am the one that has the relationship with each person while not necessarily each person has a relationship with each other. 

00:26:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So you had to figure out how you can relate to each of them individually to bring them together as a whole? 

00:26:55
BELLA Umhm. Yeah. 

00:27:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah. It’s kind of reminding me a little bit about your position with the patient, with the client. 

00:27:05
BELLA How so? 

00:27:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And whether you were going to talk to your supervisor or your boss and figuring out all of the complicated situations and who to speak to first. 

00:27:15
BELLA Umhm. 

00:27:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD That’s a bridge, a role you’ve played as a bridge before. 

00:27:20
BELLA Umhm. 

00:27:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD But let’s, we’ll explore that a little more soon, but can you tell me a little more about the family setup? So you were the, what would have happened if you weren’t the glue? 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:35
BELLA I think people would have gone off and done their own thing. 

00:27:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:27:45
BELLA Yeah. 

00:27:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And what would that have meant for you and for the others? 

00:27:50
BELLA Like losing touch with each other. 

00:27:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So can you say more about that when you were growing up? What kinds of things happened in, for you and the family in terms of being in touch versus losing touch, what was that like? 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:15
BELLA So I was helping two people understand each other better, so I would hold family meetings and try and get everybody to communicate. 

00:28:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD As a kid? 

00:28:30
BELLA Yes. 

00:28:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. 

00:28:30
BELLA Yeah. 

00:28:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And then, I know you can’t charge in Canada because of socialized medicine, but did you send them a bill? 

00:28:40
BELLA No, I didn’t. No. 

00:28:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So you were holding family meetings as a kid to bring 

00:28:45
BELLA Yes. 

00:28:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And what was the nature of the bringing together, what was going on? 

00:28:50
BELLA I think there was miscommunication or misunderstanding, so I would always attempt to bring everybody together and have a talking piece and so somebody would speak and when that person was speaking nobody else could interrupt, so that way everybody felt heard. 

00:29:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD They felt heard, wow! Right, so were inventing your own family therapy right there. 

00:29:10
BELLA I was. 

00:29:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You’re fantastic! So now, what position did that mean, you’re saying that both had a joy to it and a pressure to it. Um, what was the joy part about it? I mean what would happen when you would have these family meetings compared to before the meeting took place? 

00:29:30
BELLA Well, I would feel like we would have a little bit of progress. 

00:29:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:29:35
BELLA Yeah. 

00:29:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Before the meeting? 

00:29:35
BELLA No, like during the meeting and after. 

00:29:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Oh, during the meeting, okay, and after. 

00:29:35
BELLA Yeah, so that was the pleasure part. 

00:29:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay. But what was before, what got you to call a meeting, what was there just empty communication, was there fighting 

00:29:45
BELLA I think there was just misunderstanding. 

00:29:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Was there misunderstanding of an intense sort, or just subtle misunderstanding? What actually were you experiencing in the family that got you to become the family therapist? 

00:30:00
BELLA I think it did feel pretty intense, otherwise I probably wouldn’t have been motivated to organize this. 

00:30:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah. And what, can you, do you feel comfortable sharing what was the intense thing going on? 

00:30:10
BELLA I think there was just a lot of intense feelings and one person having, say, feelings of frustration or disappointment or whatever they were going through but another person not understanding that, and not validating that or not even acknowledging that. 

00:30:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:30:30
BELLA So. 

00:30:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow, so really one person having a lot of suffering and the other person not even seeing it. 

00:30:35
BELLA Yeah, and they were having their own suffering but they weren’t connecting. 

00:30:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. And you know, it’s, what I’m noticing as I’m hearing this story, in my body, I mean I feel this kind of tension about what you’re saying, and part of me in my more thought-based mind is going I don’t know if these are your siblings, or your parents, or grandparents, because I don’t know you keep on saying someone and then someone else. 

00:31:00
BELLA Umhm. 

00:31:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And you don’t need to say who because I don’t want to put you on the spot like that, but I’m wondering, I just want to let you know I’m wondering about what that was because you were a kid and a kid often looks to attachment figures, either older siblings or certainly parents to serve as a source of communication, connection, certainty, predictability, a sense of being protected, and security. So I hear, I’m getting a picture of the role you were in with whoever these people were, but I don’t get the feeling what it was like for you to be a kid, to be playful and just be spontaneous and not have to worry about how to be the glue. 

00:31:45
[sil.] 

00:31:45
BELLA So I think there were, there were times where I could be spontaneous and play, but there was also times where I felt I had this responsibility to bring people together. 

00:32:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:32:05
BELLA Yeah. 

00:32:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And how do you think that impacted your development as a kid? 

00:32:15
[sil.] 

00:32:15
BELLA I think I was always caring about how other people were feeling. 

00:32:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:32:20
BELLA And felt responsible to help them through their feelings or, you know, relieve their discomfort. 

00:32:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So you were really, from how old would you say, as far as you can remember, did you start feeling this pull to take care of others who without your help would actually be in a really pretty bad place? How old were you when that started, do you think? 

00:32:50
BELLA Probably about five. 

00:32:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Five? 

00:32:50
BELLA Umhm. 

00:32:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Okay, so very young. 

00:32:50
BELLA Umhm. 

00:32:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow. So we know that, from your description, that a part of your own inner experience as a five year old was to make sure other people, who I assume were in charge of you. 

00:33:10
BELLA Umhm. 

00:33:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Since 5 years there’s not that many behind you, you know, could be okay. 

00:33:15
BELLA Umhm. 

00:33:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD That you were focused on externally on what was going on with them. Right. So, what’s striking to me just in the short time we’ve had together Bella, is you know when you came and sat down initially and, you know, and you said you are going to make myself a little more open and this is how I feel and you seem very in touch with your own inner experience, is for some kids who are put in the role of caretaker, like it sounds like you were. 

00:33:40
BELLA Umhm. 

00:33:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD They are not given the opportunity to actually be very attuned to their own inner state, or at least articulate it like you do. So I am really struck with you have kind of this connection to your own bodily experience as well as being interpersonally focused. So that is really a very positive, you know, developmental finding, really, that you have both those circuits of knowing other and circuits of knowing at least your bodily self that are there. And how did you get the space while you were busy looking at other peoples’ needs to be so attuned to yourself? What allowed yourself to have that really beautiful developmental connection to yourself? 

00:34:25
BELLA I think I spent a lot of time alone and just self-reflecting on what I was feeling and possibly why I was feeling that way and what do I need in the moment, so I think I actually spent a lot of time really paying attention to my insides. 

00:34:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow! Okay, so you actually gave yourself permission 

00:34:50
BELLA Umhm. 

00:34:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Because it doesn’t sound like anyone was encouraging you to do that, or was there someone in your life tuning into your inner experience, your feelings, your thoughts, your dreams? 

00:35:05
BELLA No, I think I had to do that for myself. 

00:35:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow. 

00:35:05
BELLA Yeah. 

00:35:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So no mother, no father, no grandparents, no neighbors, no therapists, no religious figures, no, it was you with yourself? 

00:35:15
BELLA Umhm. Yeah, I would say so. I had friends that were aware of what I was feeling and they would bring it to my attention, but for the most part I, I was the resource for myself. 

00:35:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow. 

00:35:25
BELLA Umhm. 

00:35:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And it sounds like you found a way to be respecting that need to be reflecting on your inner experience. 

00:35:35
BELLA Umhm. 

00:35:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow. So as you have gotten to adolescence, you know a lot changes in adolescence, not only in our hormones, but, you know, our brain actually restructures itself during that period and these very circuits that we have for attunement to ourselves and to others start basically being a reconstruction zone and for some kids they go off line, and, um, what was your adolescence like? 

00:36:00
BELLA Friends were my priority, more so than my family. I had a lot of fun. 

00:36:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:36:10
BELLA I worked, um, not hard at school but I worked very hard at my job, so around 15-16 I began to work almost full time and go to school part time. 

00:36:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow! 

00:36:30
BELLA Umhm. 

00:36:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD At 15 or 16? 

00:36:30
BELLA Umhm. Yeah, I remember as soon as I got my license. 

00:36:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uhmh. 

00:36:35
BELLA Yeah. 

00:36:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD My gosh. So you had self-reflection going on. You went through adolescence really even more leaning on friends. You got out of the house and were working. 

00:36:45
BELLA Yeah, I was still living with my parents. 

00:36:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah, but I mean you were driving now 

00:36:50
BELLA Yeah. 

00:36:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And out and about. 

00:36:50
BELLA Yeah, the day I turned 16 I got my license. 

00:36:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:36:55
BELLA Yep. 

00:36:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So I have asked you this before but I am going to ask it now in a slightly different way. You know these ways that you had self-reflection that you needed, but you also had to take care of other people, how do you think they have shaped how you have become and could you tell us how old you are now, I have no 

00:37:10
BELLA I am 31. 

00:37:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD 31. Okay, so you are very young. So, how, that’s what happens when you are over 50, you, okay, 50 is the new 20, you know, so, um. How has this shaped you? How do you think, when you look back on it now and you look back on your childhood experiences, your adolescent experiences, I mean did you go through a rebellion period of rejecting any of your family or anything or fighting against what it is you were given? 

00:37:40
BELLA Well, I wouldn’t listen. 

00:37:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You wouldn’t listen to 

00:37:45
BELLA No. I would be told what to do and I would consider it, but if it didn’t fit with what I knew was best for me I wouldn’t do it. 

00:37:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You wouldn’t. 

00:37:55
BELLA So I really marched to my own beat. 

00:38:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Wow. 

00:38:00
BELLA And even with, like authority figures at school, in the workplace, my parents. 

00:38:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. So tell me about your relationship with authority figures, your parents, your teachers, and workplace authority figures. What’s your connection with authority figures? And I should be careful now, right, if I am an authority figure? 

00:38:20
BELLA Well, I feel that I am respectful, but I didn’t just listen blindly, I really checked in with myself and see if it fit for me and if it didn’t I wouldn’t do it. 

00:38:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Mmhmm. 

00:38:35
BELLA So... 

00:38:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So you really went to the beat of your own drum, through, with all of these authority figures, but it sounds like you found a way to actually absorb what was positive from these authority figures, not just reject it out of hand, but then evaluate if for yourself. 

00:38:50
BELLA Umhm. 

00:38:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Right. And so that’s a real source of resilience that you can not just exclude the wisdom of others but actually take it in what works for you and then move on and find your own path. 

00:39:05
BELLA Umhm. 

00:39:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD That’s very powerful, very powerful. So when you think back on all of those experiences now, do you think this influenced you becoming a therapist? 

00:39:15
BELLA Absolutely, yeah. 

00:39:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah, How so? 

00:39:15
BELLA Well, caring about other people’s feelings. 

00:39:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah. 

00:39:20
BELLA Helping to solve problems. 

00:39:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. How are you with supervisors? 'Cause you mentioned a supervisor and a boss and you had to figure out how to deal with the two of them. And I know they may be listening, so you can pass on that one. 

00:39:40
BELLA I have a lot of respect for my supervisors, but once again, I don’t listen blindly to everything that they tell me. I really see if it fits and if it’s appropriate for, you know, what feels natural to me. 

00:39:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So you don’t have the experience which some people do, I think I have myself experienced this also in my own development, of you know, finding authority figures to not take on as authority figures just because of the way family life was. It sounds like you are not doing that just rebellion out of hand rebellion when you were a teenager. 

00:40:15
BELLA So finding an authority figure as a role model, is that what you are asking? 

00:40:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah, well in other words rejection just to reject, which is what a lot of teenagers do. 

00:40:30
BELLA No. 

00:40:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You never went through a period like that, blind rejection? 

00:40:35
BELLA I mean possibly with, with my parents I did, where you know I didn’t agree with anything they said, but I think it was really short-lived. 

00:40:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So like the Mark Twain saying, you know his saying? He says, it was amazing, you know when I was 18 my father knew absolutely nothing and when I was 22 it was amazing how much he had learned. 

00:41:00
BELLA I remember being young one day and realizing wow, my parents really don’t know that much, because I would ask them questions and they wouldn’t know and it was a real shift because up until that point I thought that they knew everything because they were older and wiser. 

00:41:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm, yeah. Yeah. 

00:41:15
BELLA Umhm. 

00:41:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So this fear that we began with in this short time together, this fear doesn’t sound like it’s a recurring theme in your life of being frightened of being out of your competence or not knowing. It doesn’t sound like it’s a big issue for you. We started with it, as I said any rigidity, you said no, any chaos and we came up with that, and then we kind of did a search, sifting your mind for explorations if that kind of chaos was recurrent. It sounds like it isn’t in your life. 

00:41:50
BELLA I think it comes up in my life from time to time but I’m able to resolve it. So this one, this one incident which was the most recent incident it actually took me a week, which was very long for me because I like to move things pretty quickly, like 1,2,3 days and then it is resolved. 

00:42:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:42:10
BELLA But this did take quite a while. 

00:42:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD It took quite a while. 

00:42:10
BELLA Yeah. 

00:42:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD What do you make of that? The feeling? 

00:42:15
BELLA That it was very intense. 

00:42:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:42:15
BELLA Yeah. And I actually, I still haven’t even written up the case note, so it’s not resolved. 

00:42:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So you were worried that you wouldn’t be able to take care of this person and be the bridge to help her. 

00:42:25
BELLA No. 

00:42:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Right. 

00:42:25
BELLA No. 

00:42:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So that would have sent your whole role as a child topsy-turvy, right, if you couldn’t do that? 

00:42:35
BELLA Well, I felt really manipulated. 

00:42:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD By? 

00:42:35
BELLA By the client and how I was given the client. 

00:42:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. And that by itself could be rough. But before we get into that, do you feel you were manipulated by your family members at all. 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:42:55
BELLA Yeah, I would say so, yeah at times. 

00:43:00
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD How so? 

00:43:00
BELLA I think being told information about one person so that I would side with them and then, yeah, so kind of you know building alliances against other family members. 

00:43:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And how did you feel about that manipulation? 

00:43:25
BELLA I didn’t feel good, and it actually came to a point where I had to speak to the family member and say we can’t do this anymore, like I can’t listen to this when you talk about somebody that I love it actually hurts me, so if we are going to communicate you can’t tell me these things, and then they didn’t call me for a few days. 

00:43:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD The family member? 

00:43:45
BELLA Yes, because I think they actually had nothing to say. But then, but then we started a new relationship and so now we talk about different things and it’s much more fulfilling. 

00:43:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So let me ask you a question, I don’t know why it’s coming up on me, but sometimes in a therapeutic encounter it’s helpful to just watch something and if it comes up not just a first or even not just the second time, but if it comes up three times then it’s worth just putting in the room in a very humble way, so I don’t know if this has anything to do with anything, but as you are speaking, what kept on coming up in me was the sense of the feeling of anger, and I am just wondering what role, if any, anger has played in your life, either now, in intimate relationships now, work relationships, or as reflecting on your family life if you ever felt angry or if people in your family ever got angry, what anger was in your life, what it means for you? 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:45
BELLA I think anger is a pretty intense emotion. 

00:44:50
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:44:55
BELLA And anger is, it’s quite explosive, like you can’t really contain it. 

00:45:05
[sil.] 

00:45:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And so just stay with however you feel right now as you let anger be in the front of your mind. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD And what do you notice? 

00:45:30
BELLA I feel anger is quite paralyzing. 

00:45:30
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Can you say more about that? 

00:45:35
BELLA So I feel paralyzed if someone was to get angry in front of me. 

00:45:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. And what are you feeling right at this very moment as you are saying that? 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:45:55
BELLA I’d say a little tense. 

00:45:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So just stay present, you can have your eyes open, your eyes closed, it doesn’t matter, but just try to stay with the feeling in your body right now as anger is what we are focusing on and just see whatever comes up, whether it’s an image, a bodily sensation, a feeling. 

00:46:20
[sil.] 

00:46:20
BELLA I feel a bit frozen, once again paralyzed. 

00:46:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So now it’s coming into rigidity, you’re getting stuck and frozen. 

00:46:45
BELLA Umhm. 

00:46:45
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. Okay. So this tells us that something about anger is revealing an impairment in what’s called integration in your nervous system, chaos or rigidity are the signs of a nonintegrated nervous system state and a harmony is when it’s integrated. So it’s very important where we are at now, we have started with chaos, we have now come to rigidity, and that’s fine, and since I know we only have 10 minutes left for today, and I can feel just sitting close to you, you know, how powerful that stuck place is, I can feel that in me too, and yet with 10 minutes I know we are only going to be able to go so far with it, but I want to try to go a little further with it if that’s okay with you. Um, as you let this stuck feeling be there, just let it be filling your awareness and see where it goes, and that when I say see where it goes it can be anything, it can shift in your body, it can bring up an image, a memory, anything at all. 

00:47:55
[sil.] 

00:47:55
BELLA So it’s in my shoulders. 

00:48:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Now it’s in your shoulders, and what do you notice? 

00:48:10
BELLA That there’s not as much movement as there could be. 

00:48:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:48:15
BELLA Umhm. 

00:48:15
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You see you can actually move your shoulders around. 

00:48:20
BELLA Yeah. 

00:48:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yeah, see how that feels. And what do you sense as you just let the shoulders fill your awareness? What comes to your mind? 

00:48:30
BELLA Stiffness. 

00:48:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. 

00:48:35
BELLA Umhm. 

00:48:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So the body is stiff? 

00:48:35
BELLA The shoulders are. 

00:48:35
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD The shoulders. 

00:48:35
BELLA Yeah. 

00:48:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh, uh-huh. And I’ll just ask you this one thing and then just to see, when anger was expressed in your family, what would happen? 

00:48:50
BELLA I would feel paralyzed and I would hold my breath and hope that, you know, it was resolved quickly and it didn’t, it didn’t, get, you know, too intense. 

00:49:05
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. And if it got too intense, what would happen? 

00:49:10
BELLA I would need to solve the problem. 

00:49:10
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. And if you couldn’t solve the problem, what would happen? 

00:49:15
BELLA I would leave the problem. 

00:49:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD You would leave the problem. 

00:49:20
BELLA Yeah, so I would go take care of me. So I would go to a friend’s house, or. 

00:49:25
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Uh-huh. And then what would the problem do with itself when you left? 

00:49:30
BELLA It would resolve itself or work it’s way out. 

00:49:40
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Umhm. So Bella, as you tell me that and you know as I reflect on our time together now, one thing, and you have asked that this be a time of, you know, hopefully increasing self-understanding and insight, so I offer this to you just as reflections, they are not, you know, any kind of absolutes, but I know with your adaptive mechanism of listening to what people say and getting rid of what you don’t want it will be fine. But I just want to tell you, you know, in any encounter, it’s two human beings finding each other, you know, on the journey of life, and then one, if they are really open and connected and caring can bring authentic responses and you know if it’s worth something that’s great if it’s not, that’s beautiful, get rid of it. But here’s just a thought. You know as we explored your incredible strengths of being present in your body, of being able to tune into other people, your willingness to come up here and wanting to explore things, it’s a real honor to actually see that incredible way that you’ve developed these strengths, and one area that it seemed like those strengths have brought you to is certain emotions, like in this case, anger, have a place in you that isn’t free and open yet. So we all, even no matter how old you are, we always have what’s called a growth edge, you know some place we’re growing, and it’s always good especially as a therapist but in general as a person to say “Okay, well here I am in my life’s journey, what am I working on?” you know, always, you know. So the growth edge I just want to reflect with you on, they are telling me five minutes, the growth edge that I want to share with you, and maybe it’s just in this setting, so I don’t know, but when in our communication we have gotten to moments that might have felt overwhelming, flooding you, like anger in your family, it feels as if there’s an adaptive mechanism in you to smooth it over, to not go to what, in me, and this is just me perhaps just imagining or projecting onto you, but what to me feels like might have been an incredibly terrifying setup to be a 5 year old where the older people in the family, whoever they were, were getting really angry and couldn’t communicate and it was up to me to take care of them. That sounds pretty terrifying and I don’t mean just you know okay, I’ve got some work to do as my five-year-old therapist, but really, really terrifying, because you know we all need to have a sense of security and safety and that other people are taking care of us. So you know we haven’t reviewed, there are nine domains of integration in this whole mindsight approach and I have actually explored about five of them, just informally, I didn’t name them, you know, but you’d want to look, and I can share with you how to find out more through this mindsight book, but you know, you want to look at each of the domains for your life and see how what I am about to say to you would relate to it. In this particular case we are looking at interpersonal integration, so how it is with you, let’s say in intimate relationships now in your 30s, how those are for you in terms of being able to need someone else and depend on them and not always be the one in charge, to be able to become a part of a we, where you let go of your structures of adaptation and what some people call defenses and let yourself go from me and you to we, and that would be something to explore. From the experience of what’s called vertical integration really to allow you to become in touch with whatever feelings in your body that get stuck with anger, because I understand you’re saying anger can be explosive, and one fine distinction that might be helpful for you is to distinguish anger from rage. So that anger is a very productive emotion, it’s elicited when someone is doing something to us that isn’t right and we want to stand up and protect ourselves or others. Rage is this volcanic thing that is sometimes interpreted as anger but that is destructive. 

00:53:55
BELLA Umhm. 

00:53:55
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD So it’s an opportunity for you to actually explore in your own growth and certainly in your professional work, this distinction between anger, which is helpful, and rage which can be destructive, and exploring that would be very, very helpful. The final thing I would say in terms of two other forms of integration called memory integration and narrative integration is as you go on the journey to deepen your self understanding, the wonderful thing is that you can actually look at these issues we’re talking about, what does anger mean in my life, how do I let myself feel the ability to be believing in myself and in tune but then become a part of a we where I actually can lose myself in a membership together and not always have to be monitoring if I have to take care of that other person, and that would be a way of weaving from memory your experiences into a narrative, and a narrative is basically how we go from the present moment experience in ourself, we understand the past, and how we become the author of our own future, and that’s narrative integration. And by doing that, what you can do is actually weave all of these things we have talked about to continue this beautiful development that you started with from long ago. So I want to thank you very much and see if you have any questions for me, and then we are going to need to stop in just a minute. 

00:55:15
BELLA Okay, well thank you. I don’t have any questions at this moment. 

00:55:20
DANIEL SIEGEL, MD Yes. Go ahead. 

00:55:25
