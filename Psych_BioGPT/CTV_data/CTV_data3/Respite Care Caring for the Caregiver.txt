00:00:20
BEVERLY BAROFF This program is from the & thou shalt honor Caregiver Resources Library which is funded in part by The Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation Joseph Drown Foundation Brookdale Center on Aging of Hunter College and New York City Department for the Aging. 

00:00:50
LESLIE CONGLETON Project Director "Powerful Tools For Caregiving" Portland, OR There is been a lot of research done that shows that caregiver suffer more than the general population from stress related diseases. 

00:00:55
CHARLIE FIGUEROA Caregiver for Father He start breaking out with blotches and he don't know why, you know he go the doctor and he say well you know it's sent to dermatologist and what it is, it's stress. 

00:01:10
SUSAN WELLONS Caregiver for Parents I think the hardest thing is having someone you can contribute. 

00:01:15
ETHELINN BLOCK Father has Alzheimer's I the person that sooths if he sick, I am the person to has to figure out he is sick what have is to I take to alleviated I am the person that has to deal with the frustrations not only that I have, that he has, that my family has it's a major role. You don't get a lot of support. 

00:01:40
LORRAINE WATSON Caregiver for Parents I have another sister and I keep asking her please come and help me, I really need your help and I don't get that help. 

00:01:50
LESLIE CONGLETON So often there is such an emphasis on the care receiver that the care giver gets lost along the way. 

00:01:55
ETHELINN BLOCK They see there is two victims in this. The person and the care giver and that's scars me. 

00:02:00
DONNA BENTON , Ph.D., Project Director Andrus Gerontology Center University of Southern California I find it very disturbing that many care givers actually die before their loved ones do. 

00:02:10
BEVERLY BAROFF Overwhelmed by the physical and emotional strain of caring for a deteriorating loved one caregivers often loose the connection with the positive aspects of life and in doing so can significantly damage the quality of not only their own lives but those failed souls they turned. On this program we will explore with family caregivers and make time for themselves and find resources that will empower them in the roll of caregiver. To care for other you must take care of yourself. 

00:02:40
The Caregiver Resource Library presents Caring for the Caregiver. 

00:02:55
BEVERLY BAROFF 80% of all care giving takes place in the home by unpaid members of France. Care giving often starts by an anticipated crisis frosting spouses and some daughters and to an increasingly demanding responsibility. They are often untrained and ill prepared to perform. Family caregivers often struggle families and carriers finding themselves increasingly stretched and many cases the 24x7 care is left to one person. These caregivers either do not have the funs are the resources to share the care giving load. A common complaint is that the responsibilities are so overwhelming. Caregivers have difficulty finding time to even take a shower and get a good nights rest. Even if resources are available some caregivers fear to trust the care of the loved one to anyone else. They think they must do it all but experts disagree. In Los Angeles, California the Lorraine Watson skimps dangerously close to caregiver burnout. 

00:04:00
LORRAINE WATSON Caregiver for Parents & Sister I have a mother who is just have a stroke, she is 85 and my father is 90 and he has cancer and I think he is quite depressed for caring from my mother all the time. I also have a sister is 61 and she is blind and retired since birth and these three keep me very busy on car paint all the time. I kind of feel like a mom these days and with three children. I've asked my mother can you please get somebody you know that could help me with washing the floors are do in the bathrooms and she doesn't want any strangers in the house and I asked for a gardener and my mother said no, they don't want any gardeners. My father could still do any and he can yet. It takes for hour when I go the supermarket because my parents are so far till now just getting in and out of the car, you will be surprised how long that takes. 

00:05:05
[sil.] 

00:05:20
LORRAINE WATSON I think it's like herding cats. The three of them are in three different directions, I don't have three arms I only have two arms and I can only some many on my arms. My mom and dad were so good to me as a child, not only were they good to me, they were good to my blind sister. Whatever I wanted my parents gave me, most of all they give me all their time and all their attention. I mean all of it and now its time for me to be quiet and to give back to my mother. 

00:06:05
RICHARD SCHULZ, PH.D. Professor of Psychiatry University of Pittsburgh What can caregivers do to maintain a balance in their lives? What I think the natural tendencies of most caregivers is to give too much and probably the one most important thing are they can do is to learn to recognize when they've reach their levels and when they reach that point in their care giving carriers are to look for solutions that might involve other individuals to help care for that person. It might me other family members and might be health care professionals. But the critical things to recognize when you've reached with point where you really undermining your own health and well being. 

00:06:45
BEVERLY BAROFF Dr. Schulz's research is one of several studies that support the theory that caregivers endanger their own health and those they turned by trying to take on too much when surveyed what family caregivers wanted most was respect care. The definition of respect is to find relief. There are many ways a caregiver can find relief from the stress of care giving. It could be a simple as finding someone to look after your loved one for a half hour day where you simply take a walk, drink a cup of coffee or take a shower. Professional a volunteer caregivers can be hire or found through community service organizations to give caregivers time to get away on a regular basis. The internet offers many resources for the caregiver including chat groups were caregivers cannot work or just done the frustrations of their day. The daily phone call to a friend is another way of keeping contact with the outside world and maintaining your identity. Caregivers can turn to spiritual community for guidance. Many churches, synagogues religious organizations offer programs to enrich the lives of their elderly and give respect for their caregivers. 

00:07:55
DONNA BENTON Respect care teaches people that they have to take time for themselves so they can be there in the long run. This is a race, but it's a marathon and caregivers need to learn how to face themselves and they don't normally do that for themselves. So that's why it's very important. 

00:08:10
BEVERLY BAROFF One of Dr. Benton's programs is a 48 hour caregiver retreat which provides family caregivers and opportunity to reenergize and pamper themselves in a stress free idyllic setting. 

00:08:25
DONNA BENTON It took them so much effort to get here and just for them to leave for we call the 48 hours. It's probably taken over three months of preparation and when they start the day we really try to get them go and first of all just by having them neat and great and we concentrate on it's not care give, because what happen is the caregiver disappears when they are becoming caregiver so we actually to we ask them some silly question like what do you like in high school, what is your ice cream things that they haven't thought about in years. So, that's how we started meeting greet and then we give them, we were just call take a break. They just take a break let them wonder around the grounds, enjoy the scenery. So we give them a lot of downtime and we do massage, therapy we do therapy, we have just general games, jazz, appreciation. We've really tried of mix it up for the people and give them time to do things they would normally do. The spirit of respect is relax, rejoice and reconnect and that's what we really are trying to teach our caregivers that three hours over here. 

00:09:35
SUSAN WELLONS I had a restful night sleep, I actually slept through the whole night. There were no emergencies, no one called and I actually feel very fresh and someone gave me a cup of coffee in the morning and that was so nice that's someone made on me. 

00:09:50
BEVERLY BAROFF The concept of the caregiver retreat is now unique and San Francisco the Family Caregiver Alliance was founded 25 years ago, as a valuable resource for family caregivers. 

00:10:00
KATHLEEN KELLY Director Family Caregiver Alliance San Francisco, CA Family Caregiver Alliance has been work in on with family's need and terms of sources for almost 25 years now and the reason that we do what we do. We innovate in terms of our programs and we collect the information to evocate for more services. Is at the package of services that we provides a families here in the state and the specialized information, the assessment, the chronic care planning that we do work with the family on respect services legal and financial advice and education are the kinds of services that should be available to anybody, where ever they were across the country. 

00:10:45
BEVERLY BAROFF Social worker Diana Schempp assesses Alice Robinson's care giving situation in order to match her needs with her various programs and services. 

00:10:50
ALICE ROBINSON Caregiver for Mother And the respect care that I'm familiar with our agency, that means I can take my mother to a retreat and leave her for weekend. The first time I did that was extremely difficult for me, because… 

00:11:05
DIANA SCHEMPP Family Caregiver Alliance How was that? 

00:11:10
ALICE ROBINSON It's difficult, it was very difficult, because I didn't want to leave her. I was so sure if she was going to be able to get the care that I have thought she deserve. 

00:11:20
DIANA SCHEMPP That only you can give her really. 

00:11:20
ALICE ROBINSON Absolutely, yes. 

00:11:20
DIANA SCHEMPP Ya! And that's the part what the caregiver you know always you like that only me and no one can do as close(ph) me, which of course is true. But… 

00:11:30
ALICE ROBINSON At that point of time, I was totally exhausting, because I was trying to do that all and I couldn't. 

00:11:30
DIANA SCHEMPP Went to benefit the weekend. 

00:11:35
ALICE ROBINSON Absolutely, we are stayed in bed and all the time I got up was to use the bathroom and get up to eat and back to bed I went, because like I said I was exhausted. 

00:11:45
DIANA SCHEMPP Absolutely. 

00:11:45
ALICE ROBINSON And that's what happens to the caregivers. We absolutely get totally exhausted and with this particular agency is a god sake so I go through the weekend of the retreat(ph). When I went to pick her up I saw that she was beaming, she was happy, she had a smile on her face, the staff, the volunteers were very, very helpful. They did a wonderful job. So that was my first time. Now I have been back three times with my mother and then you also have a retreat for the caregiver. 

00:12:25
DIANA SCHEMPP You went to that too. Ha! 

00:12:30
ALICE ROBINSON Attended that. That was wonderful. Your agency provide a care for my mother while I attend the retreat. So you have two retreats, one for the person who is being cared for and the caretaker which is excellent. 

00:12:45
DIANA SCHEMPP Then they both give you break in different ways. 

00:12:50
ALICE ROBINSON Wonderful. For me it was the matter of remembering my mother and the sacrifices that she made for her five children. I was a last of five, so I was the last one to leave home and I was the one who was there to see her just struggle to make ends meet and I had a sister who was in college. She was older than I was and my mother would get her pay check and she would come home and bring it and I want to have to go through post office and right this money order for my mother with this one check that she got to sent to my sister who is college. I remember that, I remember the sacrifices that my mother made for all of us. And I think that some people adjust and tentatively(ph) tuned in to the knees of the parents and they are the chosen ones. 

00:13:45
KATHLEEN KELLY I think the types of policies that we need to put in places first to recognize this issue as a public health issue that it is going to effect the poplars in general. Secondly, I think we need to put resources and to the kinds of community services and education that have been evocated and put him place by many of the states on specialized information education respect sources, planning the systems, or counseling. Those kinds of community base services need to help a study stream of financing to enable them to grow and flourish. 

00:14:25
BEVERLY BAROFF Adult take care centers can have an important positive impact on both the caregiver and care receiver. It is estimated that there are more than 3,000 Adult Day Care Centers in the United States. 90% are operated on a nonprofit or public basis and many are affiliated with large organizations such as nursing homes, hospitals or multipurpose senior organizations. The fees for adult day care vary from a few dollars to 150 dollars per day depending on the services provided as well as reimbursement levels from public and finance philanthropic sources. The average cost of a day of an Adult Day Care is a bargain much less than a visit from a home health care nurse and less than half the cost of nursing home care. 

00:15:10
No instead of me you tie my shoes, I'm tying your shoes. 

00:15:15
BEVERLY BAROFF And Santa Barbara California, Alisha Frankel helps her mother Clara Mirafigurla(ph) prepare for her day at the friendship center. 

00:15:25
Look at how nice you look. Okay come on, come near the room here, this way, this way, this way mother this way, yes. Now your day begins get the center today. 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:55
The friendship centers above providing love it's a place where people come in there in a safe environment it providing respect for the caregivers it's about providing a place where the member is still fill dignity. 

00:16:10
GILDA PARODI SWORDS Friendship Center Manager Santa Barbara, Ca At the center we provide outdoor games, we provide bath rooming services, we serve meals morning, noon and a snack. We provide educational program for example we have seminars where families can attend. We also do chair classes, in the chair classes vary they can be for the higher functioning members and we also have classes that address the needs of that functioning members. We have gardening classes and then ah… art and crafts. We do (inaudible ), we do outdoor visits, we got the community for different visits like to the museum, to the beach during the day we also take walks the beach is only three blocks away, so we do that and gives them an opportunity to walk and stretch their legs. We provide counseling sessions for the caregivers. 

00:17:10
MARY SHERIDAN Family Services Director Here is this person who is deteriorating and it takes more and more of the caregivers time and energy and help to take care of the person and they get into a wishers cycle of spending all their time and energy, doing the care giving and often their health breaks down before the person who taking care of and then their both in a terrible place and it's so hard often to get the caregivers to look and see that to be a good caregiver they have to have time off. 

00:17:45
MARIE THERESE Conover Caregiver for husband (inaudible) they don't want to the job, it's that we're trying to do the job without enough help, because most people don't have the money for and so you end up doing it but you are been to the socks. So, since we resuming we can eliminate the disease would be just somehow having enough funding for caregivers and they truly got time off and enough so they didn't mind returning again what they were going to do. 

00:18:25
GILDA PARODI SWORDS The main thing about the friendship center is that the staff makes the friendship center, because without a staff they loves the people, you wouldn't have it. 

00:18:35
JAMIE ELTGROTH Program Assistant I here in friendship center, because I love working with the elderly. I am very interest in geriatrics and I just I get a kick out of them. Every person has something to give and I learn something new everyday working with the elderly. 

00:18:55
RANELL HANSEN Friendship Center Staff It's a feeling, it's being touched by being have service to someone they go home to ecstatic sometimes because they have help someone or they have touch someone's life or someone's life will touch theirs. So I think this internal kind of a reward. 

00:19:10
JAMIE ELTGROTH The elderly have more and offer me they have more to teach me and I just enjoy making their days fun because they make mine fun as well. 

00:19:20
And they reviewed and loved and they go home feeling very bad themselves. That's what friendship center does. 

00:19:25
BEVERLY BAROFF Part of being a good caregiver is knowing how to deal with the anxieties or sociality with the job. In Portland Aragon, the legacy program instituted classes that help caregivers cope with stress and find positive outlets for their frustration and anger. 

00:19:45
LESLIE CONGLETON We've developed the program called taking care of you powerful choose for care giving and it's a six week series that meets two and a half hours retreat and it's design for family caregivers of older adults and encourages verity of different topics. Really getting people to take care of themselves that's one the most important elements I think of the program. 

00:20:00
ALISON BURRELL Program Specialist In a few moment we want you to discuss with your partner your response to this statement. My most difficult feelings is a caregiver are we will have five minutes total, two and a half minutes each. 

00:20:15
BEVERLY BAROFF He is dropping on the conversations offers inside for glimpses and to the care giving experience. 

00:20:20
I am working and that she is a danger to herself but the time I takes to do that I did not know what she is spend all the day, or day doing. I have no idea and then we talk about it, I just get snip it up that's what frustrating for me. Trying to balance her needs with what I have got to get down I have get a lot of things myself and it's like the whole world revolves around her her and I can't blame her for that. 

00:20:50
Why my husband, even if me why him? He is a good man. 

00:20:55
He is being afraid that I'm going to be there and she didn't know who I'm. She is loosing her memory and then she is not going to regularize me next time. 

00:21:05
He thinks that he can do a lot of things and he is not able to because he is loosing his memory. 

00:21:10
You never seemed to be able to set his life forever. 

00:21:15
Well he could, he had, always had bodies in good shape. 

00:21:15
His legs are weak, he can't walk now and so now trying to get a ramp and then now they say my steps too large again I have a ramp so I need to live like 6,000 dollars. 

00:21:30
LESLIE CONGLETON So care giving is a problem really requires that it's not only on the caregivers shoulders that it is on our culture and communities shoulders to help bear the burden of helping the caregivers through right now we rely a family caregivers provide the maturity of care without a lot of support and we need to step up to the play and help those people be able to continue in that role that we rely in them for. What we like to do now is move now into tool number three dealing with anger. Nice people don't get angry do they, good caregivers don't get angry do they. But sure of this we all get angry. You can get angry and still be a nice person and a great care giver. 

00:22:20
BEVERLY BAROFF I'm getting angry, I would say let's stop pull it off and I go to listen to the music. My favorite music and at sometime like cry and crying helps me a lot to clear my mind somehow I don't know. It's a best medicine I found out. 

00:22:35
I'm a photographer, so what I do is, soon as go back and I look at the pictures of past memories of her and then sometimes it helps and sometime it doesn't because it makes you feel sad about those times. 

00:22:45
And some times they cry, ah… come in and say I hurt the dog. 

00:22:50
So I just took kind of left my mom's home and I just thriving and I just turn around the loud music and then I just a kind of a just to yell inside the car. 

00:23:05
ELLA WILLIAMS Caregiver for Husband I never angry at my husband who is the victim of Alzheimer's, very often I am angry at god and I think why us lord you know we have been good, we brush our teeth, we paid our taxes, we had been good citizens, we have raised good children, we had been more all and upstanding members of the community all out of lives. That's will make back to the bible is there some plan for people's lives or we you know destined for this and why us you know. 

00:23:45
So the reading of the bible and reflecting helps you deal with your anger. 

00:23:50
ELLA WILLIAMS No, it doesn't help me. 

00:23:50
No. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
ELLA WILLIAMS It doesn't help one bit.
