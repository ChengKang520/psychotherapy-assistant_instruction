KIM OLVER Thank you. I want to talk to you about non-voluntary clients. You know, those clients who are sent to you, that don’t really want to be there. That don’t really think you have much to say. The most important thing I believe with non-voluntary clients is creating that counseling environment. That relationship with the client that will help move you forward in the therapeutic process. You probably learned in counseling one oh one, about the non judgmental attitude, the unconditional positive regard. And reflective listening. Those are all excellent skills that help connect us with our clients. In the method that I’m going to talk to you about it’s based on Dr. William Glaser’s reality therapy. We have a very specific way of creating a counseling environment with our clients. And it’s based on the five basic needs. Dr. Glaser tells us that we all have five basic needs. And the job of the therapist is to become a need satisfying person to their client. So that you are setting up a therapeutic environment where your client can get their five needs met within that relationship with you. So let’s look at what those five needs are and what you need to do to create that environment for the client. The first need is survival. And this is the – the need to feel safe and secure. So how do you help a client feel safe and secure in counseling? Well I think some of it is about sharing with them the limits of confidentiality. Letting them know, uh, what you can and cannot speak about. You want to make sure that you don’t be – become a barrier for your client to get to the door. So you want to make sure that they have safe exit to the door. You may want to close the door or keep the door open depending on what your client feels safest with. The next need is the need for connection. So your client needs to know that you care about them. There’s an expression that says people don’t care what you know until they know that you care. So you want to make sure your client knows that this is not just a job for you. That you actually care about that person and what’s important to them. The next need is freedom. And the freedom need is very important because non-voluntary clients have their freedom need frustrated. They feel as if they have no choice in having to come to you. The first thing I like to do when I’m working with non-voluntary clients is help give them a sense of freedom by letting them know they didn’t have to come. They could have chosen not to come. Yes, there may have been consequences for that. But I want them to realize that they had a decision to make. And they decided to come. Now there’s some other decisions that they can make. They could come, not talk to me. They could come, they could lie to me. Or they could come and we could do some real work. I like to throw out those options because I want my clients to get that sense of freedom and the fact that they really do have choices to make. And if I give them permission to do the things they’ve already thought about doing, then they’re likely not going to do those things. And roll up their sleeves and get down to work. The next need is the need for fun. When clients come to us we need to have some sense of fun with them. Whether that’s laughing kind of fun, relaxing kind of fun or learning kind of fun. And finally is the need for power. And this need is also frustrated in our non-voluntary clients. They don’t feel like they’re in charge of anything. People are telling them what to do. And here they are sitting in front of you feeling totally powerless. So it’s important that we help our clients feel important to us. And we do that by listening to them. By respecting them. And by putting them in the driver seat of treatment. They may know that other people are saying they have to do certain things. But you’re the therapist. You can tell your client you don’t have to do anything. We can look at all of your options and what the consequences are for each. But the choice about what you want to do is really up to you. Once you have that therapeutic environment established, I don’t want you to sit back and put your feet up and think your home free. Because that therapeutic environment has to be focused on throughout. Especially when working with non-voluntary clients. It might take just one side step or misstep to lose some of that ground that you already gained. So make sure that you’re constantly asking yourself the questions. Does my client feel safe with me. Does my client know that I care about him or her. Does my client understand what their choices are. Are we having any fun or learning together. And finally, is my client in charge. Does he know that he’s important in this process. Then you’re going to want to move into what Dr. Glaser calls the procedures that lead to change. And these are questions that we ask our clients to help move them along in the therapeutic process. The first question is, what do you want. Most mandated clients have a pat answer for that. If it’s someone coming to you from the correctional system, they’re going to say I want to stay out of jail. If they’re coming from, uh, child welfare they’re going to say I want my kids back. If they’re in drug and alcohol treatment they’re going to say I want to maintain sobriety. And if they’re a teenager coming to you because their parents forced them in, they’re going to say I want my parents off my back. That’s usually the answer that you get. And it’s not always the real answer of what it is that they want. So my follow up question might be, what is it that you really want. They may not be ready to tell me that right away. And I may have to accept their first answer and work through the process with that answer until they’re willing to go a little bit deeper. But if I sense that they’re ready to go deeper, I’m going to ask a lot of questions about what they really want. So that I can understand what the motivating factor is. What is at the core of what they really want. So I like to find out what would change for you if you had the thing you say you want. What would be different. And I keep asking that question a number of different ways until I get a sense that the client is really at a place where it makes a difference to them. It’s important to them. And I know what’s important because I feel an energy shift. And you’ll feel it too. If you’re working with clients and their normally very talkative, outgoing, upbeat, when they get to something really important, they’ll slow down. And they’ll talk about what they really want. But if they’re normally shy and introverted, when they talk about what they want, they may get really animated and start telling you about what they really want in great excitement. You’ll feel that energy shift and that’s when you know you have what I call a quality world nugget. You have something that’s really important to your client. I was once working with a woman who came to my office, and she told me that what she wanted was to lose 100 pounds. And she was overweight and 100 pounds was realistic for what she wanted to do. But I didn’t get the sense that it was the weight that was really what she was after. So I said, if you lost the weight you want, what would change for you. And she said, well, I would be, uh – I would be healthier. Now, healthier didn’t hit me as what she really wanted. So I said, if you were healthier, what would change. And she said well, I wouldn’t be diabetic and have to take medication anymore. Okay. That’s reasonable. But it still didn’t hit me as the reason. So if you weren’t diabetic and on medication what else might be different. She said, well, when I go shopping I could find clothes that fit. All right. So now you’re healthy, you’ve got clothes that fit, what else changes? She said, well I would like what I see when I look in the mirror. Okay. So that was getting a little bit closer, but I still didn’t feel that energy shift. So I said to her, you’ve got the weight loss, you’re feeling healthy, you’re not taking medicine, you’re looking at yourself in the mirror, you like what you see. What’s different. And she got really quiet and she said, I could like myself again. That’s the nugget. That’s the thing that you want to hold on to as the counselor and remind your client about when they’re motivation is waning. When they’re losing that traction, moving towards that big goal. And it’s also something that you can work on while the client is working on losing 100 pounds, you can have small, uh, sequential steps used to increase your client’s self-esteem. So you want to make sure that you get to that motivating piece. The next thing you want to find out is not the usual question that most counselors would ask. Once you know what your client wants the next question is okay, what are you willing to do to get it. Non-voluntary clients aren’t really ready to go there yet. They’re still feeling as if they have everything going on okay in their life. Except people are telling them they have to come in for counseling. And they have to do certain things. So they’re feeling pretty comfortable about what they’re doing. So your next questions are designed to tip the scales. So that they’re not so comfortable any more. And they can feel in urge to do something different and maybe make a plan to change their behavior. So you want to ask them, what are you doing right now to get what you want. And they’re going to tell you all the good things they’re doing that are leading them in the direction of what the – what they want. That’s great. But there’s also a follow up question you’re going to want to ask. And that question is, is there anything you might be doing that’s getting in the way of getting what you want. And I always ask that question a little tentatively because I don’t want it to seem like I’m accusing them. There must be something you’re doing that’s causing you not to reach your goal. I don’t want it to sound like that. I want to sound as a general question a curiosity question that they’ll feel comfortable answering. And that’s when clients will confess to you the things that they’re doing that might be getting in the way of them reaching their goal. The next thing you want to look at is helping the non-voluntary client understand the usefulness of the things they’re being asked to do. By whatever system they’re involved in. So the question that you want to go to is, what happens if you do nothing. What happens if things stay exactly the same. What do you think is going to happen. And let them ponder that question and answer that question. Now, it’s okay at this point if your client doesn’t really know. You can answer that question for them. But you want to do it in a neutral way. What I mean by that is, you don’t want to say to your client, well, obviously if you keep doing what you’re doing, you’re going to go back to jail. Or, you know, mam, if you keep smoking crack you’re never going to get your kids home. That sounds very judgmental. That’s a way to really shut down that therapeutic process. So you want to make sure that you deliver information in a neutral way. You don’t want your client to know that you are, uh, thinking they should go in one direction or the other. You’re just giving them information. So it might – you might sound like this, I’m not sure what will happen in your case, but I can tell you that in cases like yours where clients were doing the things that you’re doing, this is what normally happens. So that’s just delivering information your client does, with that information what they chose to do. So when you’re working with non- voluntary clients, there are three things that you may want to focus on for maximum success. The first thing is creating that environment that we talked about, right. That your clients feel safe, do they feel like you like them, do they feel they have choices, are you having any fun, and does your client feel important. The next thing you want be clear about is providing neutral information and helping your client understand what’s in it for them if they do it the way they’re being told they should. And the last thing is to facilitate their self-evaluation. Now I’m emphasizing self evaluation. Because very often as counselors we may want to do that evaluation for our client. We may want to answer these questions that I’m about to share with you. It’s a big mistake for counselors to answer these questions. You’ve got ask them, be quiet and let your clients struggle with the answer. Because it’s the answer to this question that I call the scale tipping question. This is the time you’re your non-voluntary client may move from non-voluntary to voluntary. Because they’re feeling the pain of the – the behaviors that they’ve been engaging in. So the question is simply, is it working. If you keep doing things the same way you’ve been doing it, are you going to get to what you want. If they say yes, then they’re on their way out the door. They’re – they are happy with their decision and they’re moving in their – that direction. If they say no, then you have the opportunity to talk about putting a plan together to do it a little bit differently. So you ask, are you willing to look at doing it a little bit differently. As you move into the plan I like to plan for contingencies and for those things that might go wrong. So I like to ask this question. What would you have to give up to get what you want. So the mom who wants her kids back, if I say, what would you have to give up to get those kids back home. She may come to admit I’d have to stop using my drug of choice. Or I might have to stop seeing the guy who sexually molested my children. It’s important to get those things out there because if you’re only working on your singular goal of getting the kids back, of remaining sober, of staying out of jail, and you’re not looking at what the person has to give up, then it’s likely you’re going to keep making plans and you’re not going see a lot of progress in that direction. Because the client needs to evaluate whether or not they’re willing to give up that other piece. Or whether they can find a way that they can have both. When you move into the plan, if the client has a plan to do it differently, I always say go with the client’s plan first. If the client has no idea what to do, then you’re allowed to interject. You’re allowed to give suggestions as to what to do next. But when you do that, I always say make sure that you give at least three choices. If you give one choice you’re giving advice. And if the advice works that’s great. But you’ve got a client that probably won’t make another decision without you. If the advice doesn’t work, then you know you’re in trouble. If you give two choices, then what you’re in essence doing is providing an ultimatum. Client either do it this way or you do it that way. And that doesn’t feel like any choice at all. But when you provide three options, you open up that sense of freedom and choice. And the client chooses the option that sounds best to him or her of – of fulfilling their freedom need. So I have two ways to frame up three choices. I always say to my clients, you could keep doing it exactly the way you’ve been doing it. That’s one of your choices. I then like to talk about what it would look like to do it worse. And I like to throw out the worst option because I know my clients already thinking about it. They’re just not talking to me about it. And if we throw it out on the table as a choice, then we have the opportunity to evaluate the pros and cons of that decision. The other thing you can do is client, you could do it better. And I like to think of as many options as I can for better so that I can present as many options as possible and let the client chose from among those options. The other way I frame up three choices, I like to use in relationships or job situations, is you could change it, you could accept it, or you could leave it. Those are three choices. And I can sometimes think up a couple of different options for each of those. I know leaving it, you can leave it. You can leave it mentally you can leave it physically. Changing it, you can change situation, you could change the other person, you could change yourself. So there’s a lot of options in that. Remember that when you’re doing counseling, it’s a balanced equation. And you as the counselor are responsible only for your part of the equation. What’s your part of the equation, it’s creating that counseling environment. It’s providing information in a neutral way. And it’s facilitating your client’s self evaluation. If you do those things, you have fulfilled your side of the equation. Your client is responsible for their side. Which is the decision about which choice to engage in. That’s your client’s part of the equation. You want to give them their space to make those choices. And get out of the way of any consequences that come. Whether those consequences are positive or negative. That’s not your part of the equation. You want to divorce yourself from the outcome. So that whatever happens, you know you can feel good about doing your part of the counseling process. That’s all you can do is the part that is yours. And so I hope that this talk has been helpful in giving you some tips and tools to use with your non-voluntary clients. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER Kim Olver. That was such a thorough presentation. I don’t think I have any questions to ask you. 

00:19:45
KIM OLVER Wow. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER Just kidding. I won’t be a non-voluntary host. I will -- 

00:19:50
KIM OLVER That’s good. 

00:19:50
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER I have much to learn from this process. Um, actually I do have a lot of questions about this. Um, mostly because, um, I don’t know how much supervision you do. But I do supervision of counseling trainees. And, um, this is one of their biggest fears to work with the non-voluntary client. Uh, do you enjoy working with non-voluntary clients? 

00:20:15
Kim Olver 

00:20:15
KIM OLVER I do. Because I look at that as a challenge. And I always love a good challenge. I did it for many, many years. I worked in the child welfare system for 17 years. And had a lot of non-voluntary clients. And the – the peace that’s so awesome for me is making that connection. Because once you make that connection, you’re in. They – they work. And – and I get to kind of sit back and – and do my part of the equation which is what I really like to do. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Um, can you tell us a story – your favorite story of working with a non-voluntary client. Is there a favorite one that you have? 

00:20:50
KIM OLVER I’ll talk about this teenage girl that I used to work with. And, uh, she was in many, many different foster homes. And she didn’t talk to anybody. And she hated counselors and she hated social workers and case managers because she’s had so many of them in and out of her life, that she didn’t trust anybody. And she felt as if it was just a job. People were going through the motions. And of course, she thought we were making a million dollars doing this. It was – that was the funny part. 

00:21:20
SHANNON DERMER She was right. 

00:21:25
KIM OLVER Yeah, right. So I remember I didn’t try to do anything therapeutic with her initially. I just tried to connect with her. And I remember one of the things that I used to do with her a lot was take her shopping. And she was a teenage girl and she loved to shop. And she had a particular amount of clothing allotment that was allowed in the foster care, uh, world. So we would go out with her clothing allotment and we would both try on clothes. And I’d try on some silly outfits and we’d laugh and we’d have fun. And we’d go get something to eat. And this happen – this went on for maybe two months. And it was after that time and that silliness and just backing off of you got to do things differently, you know, because that’s what everybody was telling her. It – she really relaxed into a relationship that she was willing to share and talk to me. And we did some really excellent work after that. This child was adopted. From a foreign country to a single mom. Who really didn’t know how to deal with her. And then she was placed in the foster care system. So she had had nothing. But disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. So it was wonderful to work with her. And make that connection and see her begin to make decisions that were really healthy for her life. 

00:22:40
SHANNON DERMER That’s great. 

00:22:40
KIM OLVER Yeah. 

00:22:40
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:22:40
SHANNON DERMER I remember one of my favorite non-voluntary clients, um, and she was my favorite, not because it was easy. But actually because she was a challenge. Uh, and she was a teenager who’d been in and out of therapy. And she felt like she knew it all. And she can outsmart me at any you know, point. And, um, maybe she could. She was pretty smart. But I remember, um – and actually I didn’t know the language of William Glaser at that point in talking about power and things like that. But I really did feel like, she was trying to gain power. She felt like other people were trying to have power over her, instead of with her. Over her a lot. And so she was trying to take back, forcefully back also. And I stopped fighting it. And I said to her, you know, you’re smart. You know how this therapy process works. I’m going to do something with you I don’t usually do with clients. But I feel like you’re at a place where, um, you know a lot about counseling and therapy. But you don’t necessarily know how to use it in the best way. You try and use it with your family and your friends. Because you’ve – you’ve known the process a lot. So, um, I’m going to have you be my trainee in, uh, how to be a good counselor. And we’re going to, um, talk about how to do that. Instead of making you the client, I’m going to teach you some of what I do. And that gave her that power – and you know, obviously she was learning as, uh, a little mini counselor in training. Good things that were for herself also -- 

00:24:10
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:24:10
SHANNON DERMER -- but it gave her the power to feel like she had a say in the process. 

00:24:15
KIM OLVER Brilliant. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. And I – I enjoyed it. And I actually do enjoy all types of clients. And I think that a lot of people make the mistake of thinking a non-voluntary client is always a court mandated client. 

00:24:25
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:24:25
SHANNON DERMER So can you talk a little bit about the difference between in general what a non-voluntary client is versus a court mandated client? 

00:24:35
KIM OLVER Yeah. Court mandated client is someone that the court says you have to go to counseling. Or something bad’s going to happen to you. Uh, it might be that you’re going to go to jail. It might be that your kids are going to be put up for adoption. It could be any number of things. But the court is in charge of that. And they’ve said you have to go to counseling. A non-voluntary client could be anyone. I – I’ve seen many – and it’s more often males than not who are drug into couples counseling by their female partner who says we need help. And the guys saying honey I don’t know what the problem is. I’m fine. I don’t need to go to counseling. And they’re not happy about it. And they’re coming in under duress. Somebody’s – I call it push-pull or drag it in, you know, like the – the car salesman. Right if you could push-pull or drag them in then they’re non-voluntary clients. They’re not knocking on your door saying, I have a problem. I recognize your an expert who can help me with that problem. That’s a voluntary client. If they’re not coming to you with that mindset, that they’re ready to work, roll up their sleeves and get down to business, then they’re pretty much a non-voluntary client. 

00:25:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So that’s actually a much broader category. I think a lot of times a trainees and clinicians think, oh the – it’s the court mandated kind. But we actually see a lot of non-voluntary clients. 

00:25:50
KIM OLVER Sure, you do. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER Especially in couples and family. 

00:25:55
KIM OLVER Yeah, lot of teenagers are brought into counseling. And they don’t want to be there. 

00:25:55
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:25:55
KIM OLVER Bu their parents say, you must – they say to you, Dr. Dermer, fix my child. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER Yes. And I say, okay. 

00:26:05
KIM OLVER Yes. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER It’s not that easy. 

00:26:05
KIM OLVER No. It’s not. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER Now I work with individualized, couples and families. And I actually find it easier to work with a non-voluntary client when it’s a couple or a family. Versus an individual. What do you find? 

00:26:20
Kim Olver 

00:26:20
KIM OLVER Well, are you saying that because they’re some kind of systemic pressure, if you will to, um, engage in the therapeutic process. 

00:26:30
SHANNON DERMER Well, there is that. But also, um, if I work with a non-voluntary client who’s pretty dedicated to not talking to me. They’re the only person in the room. 

00:26:40
KIM OLVER Oh, I see. Yeah. 

00:26:40
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER Versus if I have a couple or family they may indirectly get engaged in the process. Like you talked about creating security and safety and things like that. 

00:26:50
KIM OLVER Um-hmm. 

00:26:50
SHANNON DERMER Sometimes they learn that there’s security and safety because they see me doing that with someone else. And then eventually they’re like, oh, I want to get engaged in this process also. So for me, it’s basically because there’s more people in the room. And rarely do I have that. But occasionally there’s the client who refuses to talk. So that’s why I have an easier time. But what were you thinking? 

00:27:10
KIM OLVER Well, I know that when I have a non-voluntary client, that’s not mandated, okay. I often will excuse them from therapeutic process. And I’ll say I want to talk to the person who’s in the most pain. 

00:27:25
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. 

00:27:25
KIM OLVER And the person who’s in the most pain wants to be there. So that’s who I want to talk to. I may invite them in at a later time. But I like to really focus on the person who has the most to gain by engaging. So I don’t really – I really don’t do a lot of counseling with a non-voluntary client and having a – another part of the group surround them. So that’s not something I’ve done. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER Ah, very good. Now I’m going to challenge you a little bit here. We only have a couple of minutes left. But I’m going to challenge you. I have a feminist background. 

00:27:50
KIM OLVER All right. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER And one of the feminist critics of that approach, although I’ve certainly done it at times too, is that you will end up with a greater number of women in the therapy room. Because usually whether – directly it has to do with them or not, they’re more engaged in change and the counseling process. 

00:28:10
KIM OLVER I find that that’s true. I do work more with women. And I don’t have a problem with that. Because one of the things from a feminist perspective is who’s responsible for your happiness. 

00:28:20
SHANNON DERMER Um-hmm. 

00:28:20
KIM OLVER It – I am responsible for my happiness. My female clients are responsible for theirs. So, if – if I have someone in my therapy room that wants help, that’s in pain, then they have a responsibility to fix that. So I want to talk to them and help them learn some skills so that they can get back in control of that happiness. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER So the person who’s in pain is the one you want to work with. 

00:28:45
KIM OLVER It is. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER Male or female, or anything else. 

00:28:50
KIM OLVER Doesn’t matter. 

00:28:50
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:28:50
KIM OLVER That’s right. 

00:28:50
