Solution-Focused Counseling with Jeffrey T. Guterman Ph.D. 

00:00:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Greetings. My name is Dr. Jeffrey Guterman. I am associate professor of counseling at Barry University in Miami Shores. In this video, I describe a unique model that I developed called solution-focused counseling. Following a brief description of the model, excerpts of a solution-focused counseling case are provided. Now let me being by briefly describing the model. The original solution-focused model called solution-focused brief therapy was developed in the 1980s by Steve Deschazer (ph) and his colleagues at the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaulkee, Wisconson. And during the past quarter-centry, various solution-focused approaches have been developed. And a growing body of outcome research has begun to support the effectivness of solution-focused approaches to treatment. Now the model I developed in the 1990s, solution-focused counseling, has been influenced by this pioneering work of Steve Deschazer and his colleauges. Some unique features in my approach are a multi-cultural perspective that accounts for the diverse world-views of clients, and an integrative approach that tailors treatment to the unique aspects of clients and the problems. Solution-focused counseling has been applied to a variety of clinical problems, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, couples and family problems, and eating disorders just to name some. Some of the main principles of solution-focused counseling include the following: a solution focus, a collaborative approach, small changes can lead to big results, an emphasis on process rather than content, an integrative approach, an approach that is brief by design, but not always, and a response to multiculturalism and diversity. Now let me describe each of these. Solution-focused counseling, like other counseling models is not value-free. It operates in keeping with the view of what problems are, and what problems are not. Solution-focused counseling holds that people have existing strengths, resources, and problem-solving skills. In effect, the natural resources that are needed to solve the problems that bring them to counseling. The emphasis in this approach is to focus on what is working in client's lives, rather than what is not working. This approach stands in stark constrast to the prevailing and traditional models of counseling. They tend to be problem-focused, and attempt to re-explain the client's problem in terms of elaborate theories of problem formation and change. The solution-focused approach holds that there are always exceptions to the problem. In solution-focused counseling, an exception refers to times when the problem is not happening, when the client expects it to. Based on this theory of solution-focused counseling, problems and change are conceptualized as problems slash exception. The problem-exception theory holds that for every problem, there is an exception. Either actual or potential. Problems maintain themselves because clients see the problem as always happening. Times when the problem's improved are absent, or seen as insignificant by the client. But solution-focused counseling holds that exceptions are never hidden. They're just not noticed by the client. The change process in solution-focused counseling is to help clients identify, and amplify the exceptions, and thereby reduce and eventually eliminate the problem. As an example, if the problem is ineffective coping skills for depression, then this is understood within the problems slash exception theory as ineffective coping skills for depression slash effective coping skills for depression. Then change process in solution-focused counseling illustrates the relationship between problem and exception. As exceptions increase, the problem decreases. The goal of the change process is to identify and build on or amplify exceptions so that the exceptions, that is times when the problem is not happening, becomes the rule. Solution-focused counseling is informed by post-modernism, and in particular a social construction is the epistomological framework. Social constructionism holds that reality is co-created in conversations between people. Accordingly, in solution-focused counseling, problems are conceptualized as the language, the talk, or the conversations that transpire between clients and counselors. In other words, counsels and clients collaborate to define the problems and goals and treatment. In constrast, traditional models of counseling take more of an educative and authoritative approach where theories, techniques, and goals of treatment tend to be imposed on the client. Post-modernism also holds that a single stable, and fixed notion of reality is dubious. Hence, it's questionable for the counselor to impose the correct notion of what is or is not a problem, or what the goal shall be. What might be a problem to one client might not be a problem to another. Uh, at the same time, I recognize that I'm an active participant in the counseling process, and therefore, as a counselor, I cannot not influence my client in some regard. So inevitably, the process of defining problems and goals is a collaborative process of negotiation between the client and me. In most cases, however, I agree to work on what my client considers to be the problem and goal. Now, frequently a small change is all that is needed to resolve the problems that bring clients to counseling, and a small change can also result in a, in a snowball effect, which in turn leads to bigger changes, and the resolution of bigger problems that the client might face. This idear is closely linked to the principle of inertia, which olds that an object at rest tends to stay at rest. And an object in motion tends to stay in motion. Inertia principles suggest that it takes an extra force of energy to initially propel a body into motion. Now once a, a personinitiates an activity, that is when they, they make a small, yet significant effort, and often leads to progress. The person often finds that it's easier to stay in motion and proceed with the activity. Taking the first step is non-trivialized, it often takes an extra effort, a sudden burst of activity, and I frequently look to my clients to uncover the 'how' of these exceptional events as these hold the key to their problem-solving capabilities and skills. It also holds true that when it comes to human relationships, a small change in one part of the system often leads to changes in other parts of the system. If a person does something a little different in his or her interactions with their partner, then it's likely that the other partner will respond differently, which in turn will result in changes in the interactions in the relationship. A distinguishing feature of solution-focused counseling is its emphasis on change processes, rather than the content to be changed. It follows that it's our job as counselors to focus on identifying and amplifying the exceptions to client's problems, rather than to focus on the problems themselves. So the focus is on process, not content. It follows that it's usually not necessary, nor is it preferable to obtain extensive historical information, or know the cause of the problem. If there even is one. To create a solution. Granted, if you take your car to a repair shop, you need to know the cause of the problem to fix it, but this doesn't seem to always apply to human affairs. Clients are usually the experts of the content to be changed, where counselors are the experts of change processes. Again, our job is to point clients in the direction of change, not to tell them what to change. Now, as I mentioned, it's not necessary in solution-focused counseling to know a lot about the problem in order to solve it. Some clients, however, believe in a search for causes to their problem. And in such cases, I join my clients in the search. An integrative approach to solution-focused counseling allows for such a strategy. In such cases, I try to assess early on in counseling whether or not my client had the idea that there is some cause, and further, if it's necessary to discover such a cause in order to solve their problem. This mindset can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Clients might have gotten this idear from past counseling experiences, from, from our culture, or media depictions of counseling, and following a post-modern perspective, the objective truth of theories of causation in our field is dubious, and not the issue at hand. The question is the degree to which the client will act as if there is a cause, and in that sense it's a reality to them. Therefore, I'd better take it seriously, and buy into it with them. So similar to how I respect the subjective world-view of my client, and use it during the change process, I do the same if their view corresponds to a theory from some other counseling model. And because I'm an active participant in the counseling process, there might also be instances when I find it fitting to introduce the formal theory from oth-, other theoretical systems. This is especially true when clients are in search of a cause, but on-, are unable to find one. When a theory, principle, or content from another counseling model is integrated into solution-focused counseling, such content is simply incorporated into the problem slash exception description. Counselors of various orientations and backgrounds need to be prepared for cases when clients might drop out of treatment, or when access to treatment might be limited by insurance companies, and third party payers. It would be increasingly important, then, for counselors to develop and demonstrate skills in brief counseling for at least two reasons. One, to help clients who might drop out of treatment, or otherwise discontinue treatment before the counselors or the clients' preferred goals are realized, and two to compete as providers for health maintenance organizations, HMOs, and manage behavioral health companies. Solution-focused counseling is brief by design. It corresponds to a theory in which quick results are not flukes, but rather are natural and expected. The quick results of solution-focused counseling are more a bi-product of its perspective rather than an end in itself. When brief counseling is by design, brevity is the residue of the counselor's perspective. Most clients bring to counseling a readiness for change. A window of opportunity that might be missed if we don't zero in on, highlight, and amplify these natural problem-solving mechanisms. It's critical, then, to have an acute and ongoing awareness that each and every counseling session could be the last counseling session. This is not to say that solution-focused counseling is always brief. It's brief by design, but it does not always work out that way. I set out in each session with the understanding that this might be my last session with the client. Therefore, I always try to be focused. So, perhaps it would be more fitting then to describe the model as focused by design, rather than brief by design. In solution-focused counseling, multiculturalism is broadly defined address various domains including gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, race, family structure, just to name some. Solution-focused counseling recognizes the importance to developing self-awareness, acquiring knowledge, and building skills relevant to the diverse world-views of clients. And it's also important for solution-focused counselors to gain an understanding of how the diverse world-views of clients inform, influence, and impact problems and goals. It follows that solution-focused counselors strive to learn about the collective world-views of many diverse cultural groups, and also the subjective viewpoints of the individuals that make up these groups. Furthermore, solution-focused counselors recognize that their own world-views necessarily influence clients, and therefore, they make every effort to do so in ways that contribute to the co-creation of constructive therapeutic dialogues, and change. Solution-focused counseling typically involves five stages which can be applied in many different and creative ways. These stages are one, co-constructing problems and goals. Two, identifying and amplifying exceptions to problems. Three, assigning tasks. Four, evaluating the effectiveness of tasks. And five, re-evaluating problems and goals. The first stage, co-constructing problems and goals involves clients and counselors working together to negotiate solveable problems and attainable goals. During this critical stage, it's important to formulate a problem definition goal that fits with the client's world-view. When co-constructing a problem and goal, the counselor looks to clients for direction in selecting a problem definition. Clients might attribute the problem to any number of various causes, including an event, another person's behavior, or a psychological construct. It is crucial at this stage for counselors to gain a thorough understanding of clients' world-views in order to co-construct a meaningful problem and goal. When co-constructing the goal, it's important that the goal be relevant for the client, attainable, specific, and measureable. During the second stage, identifying and amplifying exceptions to the problem, presuppositional questions are used to help clients identify exceptions. For example, the client asks, 'When has there been a time when you cope better with the problem?' Rather than, 'Has there been a time when you coped better with the problem?' The latter is a 'yes or no' question, that allows the client to completely disavow the occurence of exceptions. The former question carries with it an expectation of exceptions, and it encourages the client to reevaluate their relationship to the problem. Exceptions are amplified by encouraging the client to do more of the behaviors that help them cope successfully with the problem in the past. To observe times in the present when they're dealing better with the problem, and to ascribe significant and positive meaning to exceptions. If exceptions are identified, clients are helped through various questions to amplify the exceptions. Examples of such questions aimed at amplification are, 'How did you make that happen?' 'What is this that is the exception, say about you, and your ability to solve the problem?' And, 'What are the possibilities?' If clients are unable to identify exceptions, counselors might encourage them to consider small changes or differences. If clients still report that there have been no exceptions, then counsels aim to identify potential exceptions. A question aimed at identifying potential exceptions might be, 'What will it be like when you're coping better with the problem?' This question is derived from the crystal ball technique. Developed by Steve Deschazer, which involves encouraging clients to picture themselves in a future situation in which they're functioning better. Simliar to the crystal ball technique is the miracle question, that goes, 'Suppose that one night there's a miracle, and while you're sleeping, the problem that brought you into counseling is solved, how would you know? What would be different?' During the third stage, tasks are assigned to build on progress made during the previous stages. The third stage, assigning tasks is aimed at clarifying and building on the problem. The goal, the exceptions, or potential exceptions, identified in the previous stages. If a client is able to identify and amplify exceptions, then he or she, uh, he or she may be given a task along the following lines: Between now and the next time I'd like you to continue to do more of the exceptions. If a client is only able to identify potential exceptions, but they're not able to identify exceptions, then he or she might be given a task along the following lines: Between now and the-, now and the next session, I'd like you to observe for the-, those times when it happens in your life. 'It' meaning the exceptions. But in every instance, when you give a task, it's-, it's critical for the task to make sense to the client. For the task to be meaningful. Accordingly, every effort should be made by the counselor to assess if the client agrees that the task makes sense, that it's a meaningful activity, given the problem and the goal. The fourth stage which usually occurs at the start of the second session, and other follow-up sessions, involves evaluating the effectiveness of tasks. During this stage, counselors help clients identify and amplify exceptions derived from tasks that were given in the previous session. The fifth stage, re-evaluating problems and goals, involves clients and counselors considering the extent to which progress amounts to attainment of the goals that were set in the counseling. At this stage, coun-, counseling is either continued, or terminated. If the goals have been reached, or clients have made significant progress toward the goals, then counsel might ask the client if further treatment is needed at this time. Ideally, clients and counselors reach a consentual agreement about termination. If clients indicate further treatment is needed, then the counseling may be continued and-, and maybe the problems and goals may be reconstructed. The contention that counseling is unfinished indicates that the goals have not yet been satisfactorially, or fully attained, or constructed. Clients might indicate that a goal has been reached and that now there's a new goal. In such cases, it's important to help clients re-examine and clarify the problems and goals. The plan of action might need to be more attainable, and more specific, and-or more relevant to the client's problems. Now, following our excerpts from a solution-focused counseling case that I conducted that illustrates the solution-focused counseling model.

00:22:10
Case Demonstration 

00:22:20
JEFFREY GUTERMAN The case that follows is my work with a 31 year old single white male whose currently a Ph.D. candidate in philosophy. He's currently in the dissertation phase of his degree program, and the presenting problem for the client is his procrastinating working on his dissertation proposal. And we pick up the session during the first solution-focused stage, co-constructing problems and goals. So, could you tell me more about the procrastination? 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Well, in the past three months, I really haven't done any work on my dissertation whatsoever. Uh, there are times when I sit down to work, I'm gonna get on it, and it just occurs to me that this is too hard for me to do. And, so I don't. That's it, basically. That's been the pattern for the last three months, and, uh, I would like to get to a place where I'm working on it consistently, like every day. 

00:23:15
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. Okay, all right. So, so-, so now if you would, let's-, let's imagine that you are making progress, uh, for this problem, procrastination. Could you-, could you think for a moment about what would be different, uh, or, how you'd know you're making progress? 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. I'd be doing some work. I would be working on it like, every day, consistently. 

00:23:50
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. And- 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN And I-, I'd just do it, period, even if I think it's too hard, that's the thing. Uh, part of me just thinks it's too hard. So I just put it off. 

00:24:00
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. Right, and i-, is there anything else that might happen if you were makin' progress. Anything else. Anything else at all. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Uh, yeah. Uh, I'm probably thinking that I can't do it right. You know that-, it-, it's gotta be excellent work, uh, and the task just seems so enormous that-, that I put it off. It might be perfectionism. I'm definitely a perfectionist. 

00:24:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Perfectionism. Okay, that's... that's helpful to know. 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN That's definitely me. 

00:24:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You-, you think you're a perfectionist. 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Everything has to be just so. 

00:24:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. That's helpful to know. In the previous excerpt, the client and I co-constructed a problem and goal. For the client, the problem is procrastinating working on his dissertation. The client states That he sometimes schedules a time to start working, but when that time comes, he thinks to himself, 'This dissertation is just too hard to do, and it's got to be excellent work.' The goal for the client was to find as consistently working on the dissertation on a daily basis. Okay, uh, so-, so now you say that for the past three months, y-, you haven't done any work on the dissertation, right? And-, and-, is that right? 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN So-, so let me just check something with you thought. If I could ask-, when has there been a time, perhaps, that maybe, b-, before these three months, or even during these three months, that you set out to work on the disseration, and maybe you did get some work done, even in the smallest way. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Uh, times that I did work on it. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Yes, uh, and-, and you know, maybe you haven't thought about this, but when has there been a time, again, either during the past three months, or-, or before that even, when you actually did-, even the smallest way, get some work done, even a little. Even a small amount of work. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN There was one time, but it was-, it was certainly nothing to write home about. 

00:26:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, well, I'm not asking you to write home about it. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN There was uh- 

00:26:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN But could you tell me about it. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, I felt bad since I really wasn't working on it at all, so I did some research. Uh, I looked through some articles that I might be able to incorporate into my dissertation. 

00:26:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, now this is important. See, now, I consider this to be important. And-, and... uh, my interest, is how did you make that happen. Given that you have the idea that it's-, you said it's too hard to do. The dissertation, it's too hard to do, this is, uh, resulting in procrastinating that you have this idea that it's gotta be perfect, but you still set out to do some research. Don't you think that this is, uh, important? To look at? 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN I'm-, I'm not sure. Uh- 

00:27:20
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN Maybe-, maybe I just did it. Or maybe I pushed myself. 

00:27:25
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN But you know, I was also thinking differently about it. Like, uh, even though this is hard, I can still do this. 

00:27:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right. Okay- 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN So I did. 

00:27:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. In the previous excerpt, the client identified and amplified an exception to the problem. The client identified an instance when he did some work on the dissertation, and this represents an exception to the problem. I then help the client amplify this exception. The client attributed the exception to just doing it. Pushing himself. The client also identified an exception to his thinking that it's too hard by saying that when he did some research, which is an exception, he thought to himself, 'I can do this, even though it's hard.' One of the main functions of amplifying exeptions is to help clients identify the differences between the times when they have the problem, and the times when they do it. Helping clients identify such differences helps produce clarity. At this stage, an integrative approach to solution-focused counseling is produced. Theories and techniques from rationally motive behavior therapy, REBT, one of the most widely practiced of the cognitive behavioral models, was introduced because the counselor assesses that this approach fits with the client's world-view. The client is a attributing a cause of the problem to his thinking. Namely the thought's this is just too hard to do. And it's got to be perfect. It was also determined that REBT fits with the client's world-view, precisely because of his background in philosophy. REBT has a distinctly philisophic emphasis that holds that emotional and behavioral disturbanc is largely the result of irrational beliefs, or philosophies, which arises as a result of escalating healthy desires, for example, 'this dissertations is hard to do, but it's not too hard, and 'I want it to be perfect, but it doesn't have to be.' To self-defeating demands and musts, for example, 'This dissertation is just too hard to do, and it must not be, and it's gotta be perfect, and it must be perfect.' On the basis of the client's descriptions, the problem is perceptualized within solution-focused counseling's problem slash exception theory as 'Procrastinating working on the dissertation slash not procrastinating working on the dissertation.' The problem, regarding the client's thinking, is also conceptualized using REBT content as, 'This dissertation is too hard to do slash this dissertation is hard to do, but it's not too hard to do.' And also, in keeping with REBT, it must be perfect, slash, I want it to be perfect, but it does not have to be.' So, I introduced the principles of REBT to the client, and suggested that this model's techniques might prove helpful in changing his thinking, and contributing to his successfully working toward the goal of not procrastinating, and working on his dissertation on a consistent daily basis. I provided a brief didactic description of an REBT method for identifying and challenging self-defeating thoughts, and replacing these with self-helping thoughts. The client agreed to using this method, and toward the end of this first session, I deliver a task. Well, I wan't to compliment you for seeking help on the problem, uh, for coming in today, and also the coming up with a way to deal with the problem, what I think is a very effectively the-, the pushing yourself, and uh, the challenging your self-defeating thinking. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN Thanks. 

00:31:50
JEFFREY GUTERMAN I think, uh, you're very welcome, uh, so there is some things, uh, I'm gonna suggest that we do, uh, and come up with together. Uh, to-, to, uh, build on, uh what we've talked about thus far. The first things is I-, I recommend that because the pushing yourself, and just doing it method worked for you, that you continue with this approach. In other words, uh, to set a schedule to work on the dissertation, and-, and simply do what has worked before. You know, like-, like what you said, does this make sense to you? 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN It definitely does. 

00:32:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, so, you know, uh, and-, and another thing I suggest is another part of this technique that while you're getting ready to work on the dissertation and just do it, as it's worked, you might also wanna think to yourself, along the lines, uh, that's been helpful. Okay? Because-, like you said today, you have had, uh, self-helping thoughts. Can you maybe, uh, work with me to come up with some, you know, more self-helping thoughts that might go along with the action of just doing it, that you-, I might help- 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, um, well let me think. Um, all right, when, uh, during that episode, you know, where I was able to put the, uh worry, to the side and get some work done, I remember thinking to myself, uh, I was really anxious, and I was nervous about doin' the work, and I just said, you know, just put this on the back burner for a while. You know let the-, let the anxiousness take care of itself, and just do the work. So maybe, you know, talk myself-, maybe put this on the back burner. Or, we can deal with this anxiety later. You know- 

00:33:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. Okay, and uh-, and all-, that's very good, I didn't know about that helpful thing, you didn't tell me about that one- 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN I didn't remember it right away, but now that I'm thinking about this event, I do remember saying that to myself, just kind of in passing, but- 

00:33:55
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Yeah. Just sort of let it-, is that sort of like a let it go. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, you know, you have-, I remember just thinking kind of went off, you'll have time to be worried about this later, let's just work now. 

00:34:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, uh, so actually, you know, there are possibilities that I don't even know of. That, eh, you know- 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN Apparently I didn't know ab-, of them either. 

00:34:15
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Oh, uh, because what I was thinking of, actually, it occurred to me was the thought you had that, uh, you said, uh, didn't say that, I can do it. Did you-, did ya- 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Uh, yeah. Um, I said, even though it's hard, I can do this. Just do it- 

00:34:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Yeah, so I thought of that. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN The Nike slogan. 

00:34:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Yeah. Now, I have another uh, uh, suggestion. Uh, I've often found that it's, it's helpful for people to track their progress. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Uh, sometimes in written form. Uh, to i-, to identify uh, times when they find that they are effective at overcoming the problem, working toward the goal. So- 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN So, write down what's going when I'm working on it? 

00:35:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Exactly. Uh, to-, to, uh, to identify, uh, what's happening, what's different. How you did it, that sort of thing. Uh, can you think in terms of, what might be best for you in terms of doing so. You know, people have their own style. In-, in doing that. What might be a way, uh, that-, it might, this might, might or might not fit for you. You know, some people are not writers. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN No it's okay, I've got all sorts of, uh, notes on my phone, I can just whip it out and take note of, you know, whatever's going on- 

00:35:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, so- 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Whatever's going on, or-, whatever's happening. 

00:35:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN So your cell phone. You would wanna do that. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:35:50
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. So, so that would make sense to you. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, half my life is on there, so. What's one more? 

00:35:55
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, okay. Uh, one more suggestion. You know, I introduced the REBT principles. And, uh, you said to me that this might, uh, that this makes sense to ya. You know, in terms of the thinking, that self-, you know, changing, the, uh, self-defeating thinking to self-helping. Would it make sense to you to maybe go, uh, online, or go to a book store, pick up a self help book on REBT. Because, uh, I've found that those help a lot of people build on gains that they've made. In that-, in that area. Would that make sense to you? 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I could do. 

00:36:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. Okay. So, uh, do you think it would, uh, help for us to meet again? 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. I think that would definitely be helpful. 

00:36:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, you know, I ask, I don't assume i-, i-, it's necessary, I like to, you know, to further your opinion. Uh, I think y-, you certainly have identified, uh, some progress you've made, and directions to go in. Uh, but you know, I want your input on that. How soon do you think, uh, we should schedule. When should we meet again, do you think? 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Uh, let's see, maybe around about two weeks would be- 

00:37:10
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Two weeks would be good for you? Yeah, I think that is good, uh, because that will give ya, you know, some time to uh, work on what we've discussed, and also to, uh, be workin' on your dissertation. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN That's right. Exactly. 

00:37:25
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, so we'll-, we'll meet in two weeks. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Sounds great. 

00:37:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, well, pleasure meeting with you. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:37:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN And I look forward to our next session. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Sounds all right. Thank you. 

00:37:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay. At this end of this, the first session, like most sessions I ask the client if it would help to schedule another session, rather than assume another session should be scheduled. This allowed the client to make the decision whether or not to continue the counseling. Or, for us to collaborate in such a decision-making process. This tends to reduce drop outs and no shows. At the start of the second session, I aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the task given at the end of the first session. This involved helping the client identify and amplify exceptions derived from the tasks given at the end of the first session. So what's better? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN A lot, actually. 

00:38:20
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Really? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I managed to make some good progress on all fronts. 

00:38:25
JEFFREY GUTERMAN That's fantastic. Well tell me. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Uh, well, most importantly, I'm working on my dissertation. 

00:38:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Fantastic. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Incredible. Tell-, tell me what's happening. 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN Well I'm working on it every day. 

00:38:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, that is incredible. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I kn-, I'm really happy with the way things are going now. It's a pretty smooth-, i-, i-, it's not a great struggle, I-, I get it done every day. 

00:38:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay w-, tell me what's different. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Well uh, I started keeping the log, like you suggested, but after, uh, two days I just go into a roll, and I didn't need to uh, keep the log anymore. 

00:38:55
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You didn't. You just got into a roll. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN I was too busy working, yeah. I just, uh, built up some momentu. And, uh, everything took on a life of its own. 

00:39:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN And, that's very different. How have you be-, how've you been able to do this? Make this significant change? 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Okay, well, the day of our last session- 

00:39:20
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Uh, like later that night, I spent about an hour doing some heavy research. And, uh, I just wrote down, you know, I'm tired of procrastinating. Uh, just do it. It's not too hard. Double-underlined too. 

00:39:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, okay-, so you emphasized the helpful thinking. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Right, and, uh, I just started to believe that this thing was gonna be doable. You know, that it's not too hard. 

00:39:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You-, so you really started to believe it, you-, you know there's a difference between just parroting the-, the ideas, but to really believe it- 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN Well, yeah, I'm not sure if it's uh, if it's one of those, uh, chicken or the egg kind of things, I'm not sure if I, I started believing in it, and then began working more-, then began working, and then believed in it, I'm not sure which came first. 

00:40:15
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right-, you mean putting it into-, translating the thinking into action. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:40:20
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right. I-, i-, maybe it's not necessary, really, to know. But, you know, when you begin acting on the new thinking, it, you know, might reinforce the thinking. And when you start thinking, it can reinforce the action, and-, and, you know, and the thing snowballs. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Well just do it, that was my mantra. 

00:40:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right, right. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Remember me telling you about uh, putting anxiety on the back-burner? 

00:40:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN That's what I did. I said, let's do it, we can worry about it later. You know, we can worry about this later. I'd-, I'd always be afraid, you know, that I'd look back on it later, and it wouldn't be any good, but as things turned out, uh, it was good enough to look back on. 

00:41:00
JEFFREY GUTERMAN So-, so you've made a-, a lot of progress on the dissertation. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:41:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN And given the progress you've made, wh-, what do you think this says about you, and-, and-, and, uh, your, uh, ability to deal with the problem that you came in here for. The-, in general, the procrastinating. What do-, what does that say about your ability to deal with it, to-, to work on the goal, the, overcome the-, the overall problem of procrastinating. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Hm, well, um, I think I start-, I think I started to let go of the perfectionism a little bit. 

00:41:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Mm-kay. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN It's become more about working, because I feel I-, realize you know, even if I work for an hour and find out later that the work wasn't all that great- 

00:41:50
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Mm-hm. 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN I still feel better after doing an hour of work than after an hour of procrastinating. 

00:41:55
JEFFREY GUTERMAN So, i-, with regard to the idea of the dissertation being perfect, what are you thinking now? I mean, it would be nice for it to be perfect. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Well the beginning I feared that, you know, it's too hard to do, and this thing is going to flop. It had to be perfect, or it was going to crash. And, uh, I'm starting to believe now, that I'm doing this daily work, that it might not be perfect, but i-, it's still gonna be pretty good. 

00:42:20
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You know, I might, and I don't know if this is gonna fit for you, but you know, it might not only might it not be perfect, in all likelihood it won't be- 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Won't be perfect-, yeah. 

00:42:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Absolutely perfect. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN That's the truth about it. 

00:42:30
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Uh, and what do you think about that, if you-, if it's not perfect? 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN Well that's, uh, you know you asked what it said about me, that I was able to make this happen. 

00:42:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Yeah. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN I'm ready to let go of that a little bit. 

00:42:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Let go of what? 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Of the perfectionism- 

00:42:50
JEFFREY GUTERMAN A little bit. Okay. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN I still have some doubts, but the most important thing is that I'm working daily. 

00:42:55
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You still want it to be perfect- 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN I want it to be perfect, but like it says in the book, it's nice if it's perfect, but it doesn't have to be perfect. 

00:43:00
JEFFREY GUTERMAN W-, when you say 'the book' meaning, what book, you talking about an R- 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN The REBT. 

00:43:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN And have you been reading it? 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Uh, uh, yeah, absolutely. I've learend a lot about, uh, breaking down the irrational thought process. 

00:43:15
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Terrific. So, given all of this. You say the possi-, the possibilities are for you, in terms of dealing with this problem, are y-, you think again- 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN That I don't have to be overwhelmed by perfectionism anymore. That I can and will fight against procrastination. 

00:43:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Fantastic. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN And that, uh, you know, the fear of doing something is much worse than the thing itself. That's what I've learned. 

00:43:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Fantastic. Fantastic. It is important to maintain a solution-focused approach with clients during the second and subsequent sessions in order to bring about change. I began the second session with the 'what's better' question, which was first developed by the founder of the solution-focused approach, Steve Deschazer. This is a good question to ask if you're unclear regarding where you left off after the prior session, if you're stuck in a case, and for many other scenarios. Starting off any session with this question, 'what's better?', can get you and the client in a solution-focused direction from the start. This question can help identify exceptions that were missed in prior sessions, or identify exceptions that were never discussed before in counseling. In this-, in this case, the client proceeded to say that it had been a very good two weeks, and exceptions were identified and amplified. And this led to the next stage of solution-focused counseling, 're-evaluating problems and goals.' We pick up now toward the end of the session. So, what do you think the next step might be for counseling. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Uh, I was thinking about that on my way here. And, uh, I really think that right now, I got a pretty good handle on things. 

00:45:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Okay, d-, do you think we need to schedule another session? 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Well I-, I-, I'm good right now, but uh, I-, I wanna make sure that I persist in beating this thing. And, uh, I wanna get on a roll and then stay on a roll. Uh, I'm making a lot of progress on the dissertation. I mean, it's really not a problem at all right now, you know what I mean? 

00:45:25
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Sure. Something you might wanna think about now is to think about what you would do, maybe if you slip back. You know, you're doin' great now- 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Great, so, you know, it's sort of like a relapse prevention- 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You know I, have y-, have you thought about that at all? 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Uh, actually I have. 

00:45:40
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Well, it's the same thing, you know, to, uh, f-, in your situation, like to go back to what's worked, that's, you know, what-, what-, you know what I'm saying? 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, um, go back to what's-, that's how I got outta this. 

00:45:55
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Exactly. That's exactly right. And again, what are those things? That have worked. Like if you find yourself, you know, slippin' back, think back to the solutions- 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:46:05
JEFFREY GUTERMAN What are they? 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Just do it, the Nike slogan. 

00:46:10
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Right. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN You know, put the anxiety on the back burner. 

00:46:10
JEFFREY GUTERMAN That's great, that's great. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN And then finally, uh, I like it to be perfect, but it doesn't have to be perfect. 

00:46:15
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Exactly, exactly. So so it sounds like you have a handle on it, and do you-, do you feel we should reschedule at this point? Or, uh maybe we- 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Well for now, I think we've taken care of things, but uh, if I need a tune-up in the future, maybe I could come in and, uh, I just wanted to say I really appreciate all you've done for me. 

00:46:35
JEFFREY GUTERMAN You're very welcome. 

00:46:40

00:46:45
JEFFREY GUTERMAN Like most counseling approaches, solution-focused counseling holds that every person is unique. And it used the unique world-view of clients as a basis from which to organize problems, to cahnge process, and techniques. And this was evident in the case just shown. For example, it was precisely because the client held the view that his problem of procrastination was influenced by his thinking, and in particular, his view that it is too hard, that this perspective was used, and that REBT principles and techniques were introduced and with good results. Although this client was unique, in another way, this client was very typical of clients who enter solution-focused counseling. The client demonstrated that he had existing strengths, resources, and problem-solving skills. And through the process of interventive questioning, it was possible for the client to identify and amplify exceptions. The client knew best what the problem was, and what the goal needed to be. This is not to say that the counseling was not a collaborative process, where the client and the counselor both provided input into the various aspects of counseling. Simliar, to how solution-focused counseling was applied to procrastination in this case, this approach can be effectively applied to a variety of clinical problems. In constrast to prevailing problem-focused treatment approaches, solution-focused counseling emphasizes clients' resources and emphasizes a collaborative therapeutic relationship to enhance cooperation during the change process. In solution-focused counseling, it's crucial for counselors to gain an undertanding of how the world-views of clients influence problems and goal definitions. In the case shown, an assessment of the client's world-view informed how the counselor conceptualized problems and tailored interventions. I think it is important to underscore the client in the demonstration was an especially motivated and resourceful client. The case did not illustrate clinical scenarios that often arise for more difficult cases. It is especially important, then, for solution-focused counselors to be prepared to address the myrid of clinical issues that arise when working with clients, and be prepared to develop innovative and creative solution-focused strategies.
