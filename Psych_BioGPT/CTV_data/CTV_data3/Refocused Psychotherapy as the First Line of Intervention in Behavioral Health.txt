of Psychotherapy Welcome! The 7th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference The World's Largest Psychotherapy Anaheim, California â€¢ 2013 

00:00:00
 Good morning everyone. Ah, I believe we're gonna be, ah, approximately this size of a crowd. Ah, welcome, ah, to the morning presentation, ah, by Dr. Nicholas Cummings on refocus psychotherapy is the first line of defense in behavioral health. Uhm, because it's, ah, a little bit smaller group, ah, Dr. Cummings is gonna do the presentation right down here, ground level, ah, give it a nice intimate feeling especially if move from the back of the room closer to the front where you can actually look in the faces of the people he's talking to as long as he didn't look at the bright light. Ah, that would be a nice thing to do. Uhm, the other, ah, the other day I was having a dinner with Betty Alice Erickson whose fathers are rather extraordinary men. I said, "You wanna know the name of another extraordinary man?" She looked at me and said, "Who's that?" I said, "Nick Cummings." I said, "You wanna hear all the reasons why I think he's an extraordinary man?" And she said, "Yes, I do." And so I went on and on, longer than what I can do here and by the time I was done, she said, "Dan, you're absolutely correct." He is an Extraordinary man. Ah, at age 90, ah, with more energy and...

00:01:25
 More energy and, ah, clarity of thought than a lot of people half his age, ah, with someone who can, ah, write, ah, over 50 or 51 books at this-- Now at 51 books, ah,-- I found out a secret to how he's, ah, this prolific, ah, able to produce so much as, ah, three hours of sleep, uhm, only each night. But, ah, someone who has been recognized as the, ah, sage or oracle in our field who's predicted movements, ah, such as managed care long before they occurred and, ah, ah, advised the field and what we need to do to make ourselves ready for these things. Ah, ah, predicting the, ah, shift to on floor care and now we will find out, ah, ah, now with this best selling book already just released, ah, Refocused Psychotherapy, we can learn more about, ah, this particular topic. So please join me in giving a warm welcome to Dr. Nicholas Cummings. 

00:02:30
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Thank you Dan and, ah, I'm amazed how many of you were up on eight o'clock on Sunday morning. Ah, this is no chore for me. I spend most of my life getting only three hours of sleep because it's all I needed. And, ah, I was telling, ah, Dan since he asked me about it, ah, years and years ago I became the psychotherapist for actors and actresses who might have a panic attack or something, ah, during their performance and I remember wa-- one, well, I can't mention the names because these, these are not only famous actors, they were patients. And, ah, at, ah,-- he finished a performance at the Geary theater in San Francisco at 11 o'clock at night, had a terrible panic attack and just barely got through his performance. And he says, "Where is the psychotherapist at 11 o'clock at night when you really need 'em?" And this other actress, "So why don't you call Nick Cummings? He's probably still in the office." So I got this call and this is a very famous actor. Ah, he's dead now but at that time he was tops. And, ah, I want to make sure that this wasn't a crank call and or I can, I can verify, "Yeah, this was he." And I said, "Well, hop a cab. You're only 10 minutes away." So I saw him and then I saw him after his performance and makes three nights and he wrote in a variety of magazine which is the, the journal for, ah, the acting profession. If you're ever in San Francisco and you need a therapist in the middle of the night call Nick Cummings. He's probably still in the office. The, ah, how many of you have seen refocus psychotherapy? Oh, oh, okay. Ah, this is the main text book now for the doctor of behavioral health program at Arizona State University. I've been asked to say some, something about. Ah, it's, it's the greatest thing since pay toilets. Ah, it's, it's brand new, four-years-old, we designed it for 20 graduate students and lo and behold, it's now 300 and it would be 800 if I didn't put a cap on it because I don't wanna get so, so large that we can't do the hands-on training that need to be done as part of the program but I'll talk more about it later cuz I've been asked to. Unemployment rate for graduates in social work counseling, M.A. Psychology is 40% now. Unemployment and under employment together is 40%. Our student are grabbed by the marketplace the day they graduate. I am not exaggerating. Five of them are already vice presidents in charge of the mental health of huge health care systems. The latest, Dr. Thomas Barrett, one of our graduate has just made pre-- ah, president in charge of mental health grad, women's health systems which is a mansion of huge health system. This is when unemployment is underemployment rate, the graduates is 40%. Why? Why? Because it is meeting the needs of the marketplace. Marketplace is that dirty word in psychology. Yes, that is prisoners. Never curse the psychotherapist who are in private practice if they're in business. Yes you are. You give a service, you render a bill, you're paid, it's a business. So I don't know how in the world we identify business with the bad part of business which is certainly out there. It is certainly out there but how many small business people in the United States today are working hard, making a living, feeding their families in legitimate, small businesses. Okay, a few months ago I saw an item in a newspaper that absolutely tickled me. In Mount Vernon, Texas-- I don't know where Mount Vernon, Texas is but Texas is a huge place. In Mount Vernon, Texas, a madam Jill Diamond(ph) decided to expand her house of ill repute and she tripling the size of her whore house because business was so good. And the local baptist church was incensed and they held prayer meetings, morning, noon and night for several weeks. Praying that god would interfere with the expansion of this whore house in their town. And two weeks before it was to be opened, it burned down. Lightning struck it and it burned down. The church was ecstatic. They had a celebration, they thanked god and about that time, Jill Diamond(ph) filed a lawsuit that they had burned down her whore house. The church filed a counter suit that they had nothing to do with it. So the judge who was assigned to this case said, "What am I supposed to do? I have a whore house matter that believes in god and a baptist church the doesn't?" 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:50
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS I thought this was funny but right after right after that-- this was a news item on television. They're all fakes. And right after that there was a dialogue between psychiatrist Keith Ablow. Ah, many of you may have seen him on television and a psychologist, Ph.D. psychologist whose name thankfully I forgot. And they had a debate about one of the, ah, young people's murders of, you know, the vast murders. And Keith Ablow was talking about the fact that for months and often years, the signs of homicide are present and nobody pays any attention to it. The psychologist argued that there was no way to foresee the homicidal attacks such as this. Colleagues that is our-- abdicating our responsibility. I guarantee you and I have it for 25 years. There are ways to predict this and you can find it, intervene, come in with the appropriate, ah, interventions and prevent these homicides. And when I was President of American Biodyne we had 25 million enrollees. We had 11 such that would have been murderers that we intervened with. Why do we give up so easily? Why? You know, our field has been absolutely peppered with-- well, you know, way back he used to treat mental patients by throwing into frozen rivers that was supposed to shock them. Another-- do you know about the whirl chair, whirly chair? The chair that would be on a post that had these-- proves, and then you put the patient in the chair and it comes down over the next 10 minutes. He's whirling. Ah, once every two seconds and by the time they get to the bottom, they're in convulsions. This was the original shock therapy and it was done for years. Then we invented real shock therapy and we invented lobotomies. Our profession is absolutely hawk mark with wrong approaches. And so now all of a sudden, well, let me back up, why? First of all, How many of you are M.A. level practitioners? How many have Ph.D.s? Most of you, okay. Are you in practice or do you teach? You're in practice. Most psychotherapy today is done by M.A. level people. The Ph.D. has never been able to successfully convince the world that having a doctorate keeps your leg up on psychotherapy. So what have Ph.D. psychologist done? They have gravitated to academic positions. Because M.A. level psychologist are knowledgeable. So I apologize profusely to all of you who are not like this but most training nowadays is done by people who never see a patient. Never see a patient. The thrust is we gotta be scientific. Now, psychotherapy is not a perfect science. It is a science made possible by artful practice. Surgery on paper in a science. You cannot read a book and do surgery because it's an art. And e-- and all the surgery books say the same thing but surgeons are fantastic, others are clumsy, it's an art based on science. We forget that and now our graduate schools are pell-mell saying we gotta be scientific and all we become is rigid. It troubles me. Troubles me deeply. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:50
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Cognitive therapy is a legitimate form of treatment. It fits science much better than anything we've ever developed that is practicing surgery only with one arm. Cognitive therapy has limitations. Its purpose is to correct, correct wrong kinds of thoughts. Does not get at the root of why you have long thoughts. The other arm is psycho dynamics and I don't mean the kind of psycho dynamics that we had way back in the Freudian era. That was fanciful. What I mean now-- we excuse my back. I mean the kind of psycho dynamics now that are alive and pertinent. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS And in our book we focus we focus psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, psycho dynamics. All of the appropriate interventions are included. We do not believe in schools of psychology. We believe that every school has a contribution. For example, cognitive therapy is very appropriate for certain kinds of conditions. It is totally useless in others. And when you say one size fits all, this is why we have so many failures in psychotherapy and the other is how many of you know my onion garlic syndrome? One, okay. Two. All right, when you eat onions for lunch and you come back to the office, when you talk to your friends, nobody is bothered by your breath except you. Every time you swallow you taste onions. But what if you have garlic for lunch? You don't feel it but all your friends are going "shoo!" Onion people suffer, garlic people make every else suffer. All of your patients are either garlic or onion. Most are garlic using an overlay of onion to get your attention. And so, if we treat all patients as onion as we do, because we love our patients, we don't wanna be strict with them or you won't wanna be direct with them. We treat all patients as onion and the garlic patients have absolutely overloaded our healthcare system coming in when they're in trouble, they're about to lose a job, about to go to jail, about to have their car repossessed, they come to see you and they are so onion and needy. And as soon as the crisis is over you never see 'em again until the next crisis of course. And since garlic patients are aggressive and assertive and onion patients are timid, 90% of our patients are garlic and we go around and around with cognitive therapy and we wonder why they therapy for 10, 20, 30 years off and on when they need you. Let me start with a, an onion patient as a demonstration. Ah, thinking of my patient Patricia which is not her real name of course. She is leaving with a man who lies on the couch watching television, smoking pot all day while she goes out and works, comes home, cooks dinner, does the dishes, cleans the house. And so, Patricia saw two therapist and with each therapist she said, Help me leave my boyfriend." Now this is the kind of man I can very stumped. Colleagues, the world is full of male very stumpkins(ph). She saw two therapist asking them, "Please help me leave this man." the therapist took her to her ward. You know, patients have two approaches. One is the real reason they're coming which they don't tell you about and the other is the manifest reason that they're using an excuse to see you. And all the while you're inside they're hoping you'll see through all of these and get to the real problem but if we accept the manifest reason, we're off on our own tangent. So Patricia saw two therapist in in succession asking please help me leave this man and they tried to help her leave this man and the more they tried the more she stuck to him. Of course! So she came to see me and I listened to her story and I said to her, Patricia, I am not convinced you have done everything possible to change this man and demonstrates you love him. So I'm gonna give you some homework. I want you to go out and do three things that you've never done before that will make this man love you. Says, "Okay, doctor." She came back the next week. she had done all three things. Very shrunken but still there's shrunken. Said, "You know, Patricia, somehow you either didn't do the right. I'm not convinced you're doing everything necessary to help this man change so that you could love him. I want you to go out and do three different things to help this man. She's a little more skeptical but says, "Okay, doctor." She came back the next week, she had done all three and of course their shrunken was still very shrunken was still very shrunken and I told her again, "Patricia. I'm not convinced." So I gave her three more things. Asked her to come up with three more things to get him to come back to her to be a real, real boyfriend. So she went out, she came in on the following session and I said, "Well Patricia, did you do your homework?" And she says, "Doctor, I have to tell you I left him." That's not the end. She says, "I was amazed that three days later he moved in with another woman. See, what I was addressing was Patricia's own inferiority feelings, that I am not worthy and this is the only man that I deserve. That was not addressed before and she said to me, "You know, within three days he moved in with another woman. Your colleagues-- there are so many women who doubt their own veracity that there's a shortage and very shrunken this society. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:45
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Do you see how different this was than our previous therapists? The idea of going along with the resistance shocks most therapist. Why would I do that? Because that's how you get under and past behind the resistance. Now let me give you a case of a psychotic, schizophrenic. A man was referred to me by his doctor, ah, because he is actually his dentist because he want to all of his teeth removed and his teeth were healthy. And then he told his, ah, dentist, "I don't wanna bother these teeth anymore. I wanna, I wanna be, ah, hal-- all set of -heights." And he-- the dentist began to worry, "Well, maybe this man, there's something wrong here and he'll end up suing me for taking out all of his good teeth." So he sent me this man to s-- for me to report back on whether or not he was, ah, already opened up. 

00:27:05
[sil.] 

00:27:10
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Well, during the first session I said, "No, come on. Tell me the real reason why you want all your teeth out." And he thought a while and he said, "Can I trust you?" I said, "Look, anything we talk about here is private and confidential. It's up to you if you want to trust me or not. If you cant trust me, let's end it right now and I won't even charge you for this session." Oh, thought about that, it was pretty fair so he tells me, "Well, I have a secret that the government is terrified it's going to be revealed. And if it is revealed, it will probably bring down the administration. And they are trying to drive me crazy and if I became insane, then nobody will believe me if I reveal the secret. And the reason why they're trying to drive me crazy is that they've already, ah, killed the two other people who knew the secret. My father and my sister who they kill." And sure enough, two years earlier the father had died. The fact that the father died of a disease and old age was irrelevant to this man the fact that the sister in being desponded at the father's death, committed suicide. That did a huge-- there were murdered in his mind. Why was he talking about being murdered. He was doing the opposite of what the real feeling was if you're in suicide. He felt that he was gonna kill himself. So you project that outward, they're trying to kill me, I don't want to commit suicide. So what did I do? I said, "You know, we've got to somehow defeat these people. What I want you to do, I want you to go out this next week and you tell me they're following you everywhere you go, they follow you. Now, have you noticed that when they follow you they can't have the same operative following you all day because you would begin to notice him. If you notice every once a while, he drops out and somebody else drops him." He said, "Yes doctor, that's exactly right. How did you know?" Well, how do I know, that's what paranoids think. So I said, "I want you to write down a description of the person who's following you, at what exact time he drops out and somebody else comes in and his description. And do that all through the day and do it for the whole week." I come in with this cuz there is the pattern here and if we can discover the pattern, we can eliminate your problem. You notice in all of this, I was very careful not to say one thing. "I believe you." Cuz if you lie to a patient, you discredit. So I'm joining his delusion without saying I believe you. It's very important. He came in the following week and he had done his homework precisely as I asked which paranoids do. So we begin to chart this and put it-- I scotch taped the charts on the wall, sent him out and I said okay, this is great. Do it again next week. He came in the next week with a stack full of notes, we made more charts and scotch taped into the wall. Ah, my office began to look like the war room in the Pentagon and I said, "Wait a minute, wait a minute. Charles, at three o'clock on Tuesday this guy that came in behind you and started following, that's not a secret agent. Look at how well dressed he is." Beautiful suit and neck tie, that's the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover and says that the FBI dress very, very well. I said, "That's if..." I said, "Oh, my gosh. Don't tell me your secret please cuz I, I don't wanna be vulnerable but it's, must be really something cuz now you've got the FBI in on this." "Oh," he says, "Wow." Let's keep it up. He came in the following week. The charting, putting the charts up on the wall. Wait, Charles. Wednesday, Wednesday, 11 A.M. Look at that guy whose, whose, who you described very well. A short, stocky, has a mean looking face. I said, "That's the Russian KGB! My gosh, what a cold kind of a secret you have in. Don't tell me about it. I don't wanna know but you got the KGB after you." He came in the following week, started to put up charts. He says, "Doctor, may I interrupt?" And I said, "Yeah." Ah, he said, "You know, last week at the end of our session I began to think that maybe this is all a figment of my imagination. And now, I thought about it this last week and I've imagined all of this." "But you were having such a good time I didn't wanna interrupt you." His delusion is over. He's still schizophrenic, now we start treatment. As long as he had this delusion you could not start real treatment. Now there are the kind of things we teach. We try to go from point A to point Z in the most effective, ah, time possible. Now, our Doctor of Behavioral Health Program quickly-- Eligibility, you need a master's degree in one of the social sciences and no less than seven years experience. Our average intern has 11 years experience. We try to pick people who think out of the box. We are not interested in master's level people, the one upgrade to the doctorate who are interested only in people who want to learn on absolutely new profession. Now why did we make-- didn't make it aside that you're a Ph.D. in psychology. I tried that. The California school of professional psychology for example which I founded in 1969. For this first seven or eight years, was absolutely as new kind of program and then they made a mistake. They-- after I left, they decided to apply for APA Accreditation. And the requirements of the APA are such that you don't have room for the pertinent stuff cuz you got too much folder all in there. You know how I, I, I really am an advocate of diversity but for heaven's sake, how many courses in diversity do you need? So we invented a new doctrine and when the President of Arizona State University, Michael Crow, came to me and said, "I want you to found this program at ASU." And I said, "President Crow, no. Psychology will kill it." He kept at me for three years and then one day he called me for lu-- said, let's have lunch and we had lunch. During lunch he said, I have a solution. We will put this program in the medical school and we will build a barrier between the program and the psychology department. They did. It's now the larges doctoral program in health solutions with is the medical school of Arizona State University which is a medical school jointly with Mayor Rochester. So Nicholas A. Cummings, Doctor of Behavioral Health Program is the largest program in the Arizona State University, Mayo Rochester School of Medicine. We want students that think out of the box. We want students who are interested in doing it, a kind of therapy I just gave two examples of. We do not want student that just want a doctorate. Now, the doctor, it is important. To those of you who don't have doctorate, even though you've acquired a great deal of prestige in your place as you have no idea of this chauvinistic medical profession treat you differently when they address you as doctor. They do, it's inevitable. We are practicing in the house of medicine. This is not our house and we train our students when you go into the medical study, you're gonna be working side by side with physicians. And our goal is eventually that physical will more than wish you to work side by side with her or him on an equal level. But you don't go in there and require that. You earn it and the way you earn it is that you demonstrate how helpful you've been and then come that day when the physician really flubs. Really does a heck of a jo-- awful job with a mental patient and brings you-- and then you rescue that doctor and from then on you have her/his respect and you work side by side together because our goal is for primary care physician and behavioral health practitioner to work side by side in every primary care setting. And this has grabbed a number of health systems. They see the value in this and they hire our students on graduation and they place them and it's working. It's working colleagues. 

00:39:50
[sil.] 

00:39:55
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS And just between us, the APA can't do anything about it because it's not a Ph.D. psychology. Now, I mentioned that the doctorate I found way back in the professional schools got corrupted and I was afraid that you would get corrupted, this would get corrupted because this other university's adopted and they water it down and they change it, they alter and they massage it. Ah, and the head councilor at ASU said, "Why don't we patent this. Huh? Never heard of a educational program being patented. Can it be?" "Yeah, sure." So he came back six months later and he said, "Yes we can patent this." But since ASU is a state institution, every state institution, ah, in Arizona in-including the state police, everybody else will own this. I said, "Well, that's that." She's, "No, why don't you patent it?" And I can. Yeah, says, "I'll do it for you." So six months later he said you are now the owner of a patented and copyrighted doctor of behavioral health program. I have had nine universities wanna copy this. They have come to me and who, who started working out. They were very interested, there was always one or two psychologist in the psychology department who saw the value of this and wanted to do it. The problem was, when I said it can't be done in my psychology department, it was stymied. So we remain the only one and that's why we let it grow to 300 graduate students, we have fif-- 15 full time faculty and 37 part time faculty and the part-time faculty teaches that with which they make a living. In other words, if you teach psychotherapy, it's because you're doing psychotherapy. If you teach, ah, something else like, ah, ah, phobias, it's because you treat phobias. In that you're a specialist. So on and on it's a very hands on program and I'd like to leave time for you to ask questions if we made the remaining time. Do we have some time Dan? 

00:42:50
DAN We have about 10 minutes and so I think that would be enough time for maybe, ah... 

00:42:55
 Question over here. 

00:42:55
DAN Okay. 

00:42:55
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Okay there. 

00:42:55
 Ha-ha, thank you. This mic. Uhm, Dr. Cummings, ah, first of all, uhm, I believe you're the first presenter at this conference to talk about integrated health. Thank you. Ah, but secondly, do you have any, ah,-- I know you used to be heavily involved in the business of behavioral health. Give me comments about where we're headed with affordable care act in integrated health on a more of a national scale. 

00:43:25
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Yes, I, I get a lot of questions about what's gonna happen with, with ACA Health, commonly known as Obama Care. Eventually, colleagues, we're gonna gravitate to-- on the health system, it's inevitable. But this launching is a fiasco. It is absolutely the biggest blunder I have seen on the political horizon in decades. What is the problem with it? We have people designing the health system who have never seen a patient, never have seen a patient. This is not an armed chair endeavor, it is a hands-on, gut-level, hardworking system that has to be designed by people who look down it, are doing it, know how to do it, appreciate it and that's not out bureaucrats. So they issue to resign gracefully and exited and we could forgive her because she did as much as she could do not being a practitioner. The only criticism that I have of her is that she doesn't know when to exit. Cuz we need somebody who knows how to practice that will design practice and until that happens, we'll all become pawns in a dysfunctional system. God help us. I-- that doesn't happen. Yes. 

00:45:15
 Yes, thank you for your remarks. Uhm, I'm one of those psychologist who has been in private practice or in the medical school, all of my practice so I know about that, uhm, side by side step. Uhm, my question is for, for those of us who are, ah, in the midst of the sort of traditional psychological, ah, professional family, how do we, use your book, how do we, ah, to the, to the extent that we can, ah, without, ah, copyright infringement. 

00:45:50
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Without their premise in... 

00:45:50
 Or, or copyright or patent infringement. I'm, I'm being little facetious but talk with me about-- you, you're telling us you have the book and please, uhm, buy my book but you're also saying everything I'm doing is, uhm, is, is patented. So chat with us a bit about that would you? 

00:46:10
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Being patented doesn't mean that you can't do what's in the book. 

00:46:15
 Ah, what we-- I can... 

00:46:15
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Being patented means you can't found a doctoral program that based on this method. You can read the book, learn from it, implement it, practice it. Ah, I wouldn't have written the book if I didn't want our profession to elevate itself. 

00:46:35
 Thank you. 

00:46:35
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Okay. 

00:46:35
 Hi, Dr. Cummings, I was just interested to hear your thoughts about the future of psychotherapy and the computerized treatments. 

00:46:50
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Oh, gosh. I hate to get into this. Ah, this is the computer generation, there's no question about it and young people now, ah, they don't interact anymore unless it's on the internet. Ah, it's a shame. I can't believe all of these teenagers that spend three fourths of their lives on the internet but that's what we've barricaded to and there's going to be internet kinds of therapy. There's to be the colleagues you will never replace one on one psychotherapy. And I predict that the more internet we become, the more the need for individual hands on communication and understanding is going to grow by leaps and balance. I predict that in 20 years, and I can make this prediction cuz I will be 90 years old and I won't be around for you to say, "See, it didn't happen." But in 20 years, we're going to see the effects of a computer generation. People are losing the sociability. It's a shame. I don't know. What can I say? But I don't wanna speak again to those who are doing computer therapy. Okay. 

00:48:20
 Ah, Dr. Cummings, ah, I've been in for years I've always felt that there's an over medication with psychotropic drugs on, ah, the patients and we-- as you're gonna be on a med school, how is that gonna affect the dynamics? Are you gonna be intimidated by that cuz I think-- I'm not saying your-- but to me it has a very powerful pressure to go along with that stuff. 

00:48:40
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Physicians now, not just psychiatrist, but physician's primary care positions. Eighty percent of their patients are on medication of some sort. Eighty percent! And for those, if the medication doesn't work, they said the psychiatry or on the psychiatrist or he hands another medication. If that doesn't work he hires a fourth and a fifth. Our working side by side with physicians gives the positions and alternative and they start turning to us and they ask for your behavioral interventions cuz they see the work. If you're a busy, ah, primary care physician and you're allowing 15 minutes per patient but then you really only give them seven cuz that's a national average. Seven, and it's-- you see your doctor because the doctor has to make notes, return the phone call so that instead of 15 minutes you get seven. They can't do this! They're terrified that the patient is gonna start talking about their emotional problem and it's, "Oh my gosh, I be here for the next 55 minutes and I have a waiting room full of patients. I can't do that." Where you're there, they value you, they start to befriend you, they call you in, they do the hallway hand off and it changes the whole system. Changes the whole-- they don't find this. Yes. 

00:50:20
 I wanted to ask you a very specifically question. I was intrigued by your treatment of your, uhm, patient with a paranoid delusional system. I find that set of patients with the fixed paranoid delusional system and possible to treat. Have you done that method with other patients like that and does it work cuz I would be afraid that it would just spin bigger and bigger and bigger. Sort of, uhm... 

00:50:45
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Yeah, this is the fear. Ah, you know, we're afraid to venture beyond what we're taught in graduate school. Ah, colleagues, it works but you've got to do it with everything you and your body cuz you if you don't believe in what you're doing, you're going to flub it up. When you do this in fact, you know, students have asked me in the past if I should take another course was, what should I take. I said, "Take a course in acting instead(ph) of soft skins, ah, method where the actor places himself or herself in the role that they're going to play and become that role and that's why they do a great acting job." You need to believe in what you're and until you do, you better get supervision on because you will fail. Because the patient will see, ah,-- paranoids. They ha-- they have, ah, a fourth dimension vision and that is in-infallible. They will see your hesitation, they will see your doubt, they will see your fear and nothing will happen. Yes.

 Dr. Cummings, I wanna give you a plug for one of your book that I think is little less well known and that is, uhm, the first session with substance abusers and I think your approach is leagues better than motivational interviewing which I think is namby pamby change talk. It doesn't work, it takes too long, it doesn't get a tender line in psycho pathology and you could just talk a little bit about MI versus your approach, I'd appreciate that. 

00:52:30
NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Whoa, that's a big subject that I hate to get into it because, ah, on a partial level, it's misunderstood. But we did write a book, my daughter and I, ah, Dr. Janet Cummings, my daughter and I have written nine books together now and this is one of them. And, ah, it's called the first session, ah, because, ah, of hidden substance abuse because the series asked us to write a book. Ah, they were writing a series of the first session of phobias, per session of this, per se-- so, but we ended up writing a book that covers the whole field. And so, the net-- the title is stopped but it's, ah, it's not just the first sessions, the entire treatment procedure of drug addiction. And it's a totally, totally different approach. Ah, it is as different from the usual as my treatment of the paranoid that you just heard. It's from the usual. And, ah, those of you who see, ah, any kind of addictions including gambling addiction as well as, ah, substance abuse in alcohol. You'll find it a very valuable book. It's used in many, many, ah, substance abuse treatment centers as the holy bible which, ah, that's neither here nor there but in any rate, you might look into it. 

00:54:00
DAN Thank you Dr. Cummings for this, ah, wonderful talk.
