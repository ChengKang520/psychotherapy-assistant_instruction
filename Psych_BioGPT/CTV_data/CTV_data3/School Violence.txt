Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:10
WINNIE KING , MD Hello. I’m Dr. Winnie King and welcome to keeping kids healthy. This is a program about your children’s health and it comes to you as you can see right from the lobby of the children’s hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx. So don’t be surprised if you see some people walking around in the background or even if you hear some strange noises. Now today we are going to take a look at an issue that affects every one of us. Violence in the schools and the steps that you, your kids and the schools can take to make your kids safer and in the process we’ll give you an extraordinary look inside the mind of one former offender. Now it isn’t always the big things like school shootings that worry your kids. In a nation wide survey, children ranked bullying as an enormous problem, worse than racism, AIDS or even the pressure to try drugs and alcohol. In a few minutes we’ll tell you what you and your children can do to avoid bullying, so have your pencil ready. But first we begin with a chilling look into the world of a violent offender. How he experiences it and why he was he was () to violence. Jim Bunn has the story. 

00:02:15
JIM BUNN Life is good in the beginning. 22 years ago, Tajaé Gaynor was born into a loving family living in Jamaica. His father, a mechanical engineer, his mother, a school teacher. When he was 6, they moved to (inaudible ), Tajaé thrived. He was an honor student. A football player so good that college scouts were looking at him when he was just a sophomore in high school. Then something happened. The family moved to the Bronx and he quickly learned a new code of conduct. 

00:02:45
TAJAÉ GAYNOR We saw a lot of fan, you know because that’s the way we grew up, you know the codes of conduct. You fought to gain your respect, you fought to have people know that you’re not a person to be messed with. 

00:02:55
JIM BUNN Would you only go after the tough guys? 

00:03:00
TAJAÉ GAYNOR You know I tried to assert myself to anyone who was around. 

00:03:05
JIM BUNN Eventually for what should have been his junior year, he stopped going to school altogether. 

00:03:10
BEVERLY GAYNOR Tajaé Mother I became very worried and I know if he continues on that path, what would have happened? 

00:03:15
JIM BUNN Keeping Kids Healthy The violence was all around him. When he was 17-years-old on the street corner he watched two of his friends get into a fight. His friend Edward stabbed to death. That happened right around the corner from where his cousin used to live. His cousin is in prison now because he got into a fight and defending himself he killed yet another one of Tajaé’s friends. 

00:03:40
TAJAÉ GAYNOR And it was a wake-up call for me. You know, it made me realize that anyone can be a victim to violence. You know, it really made me start thinking about how I dealt with situations. 

00:03:50
JIM BUNN Tajaé still lives in the Bronx and occasionally still finds himself living the violent life he grew up in. But a program called Effective Alternatives in Reconciliations Services helped him turn things around. Not only has he found a way to manage his anger, so he doesn’t hurt anybody else, he has devoted his life to working as a counselor and a mediator for young people and example to others who uses himself and the memory of the friends he has lost to think twice about those codes of conduct. 

00:04:20
TAJAÉ GAYNOR He had a knife in his hand, right, and he had it hold to the point that we couldn’t see it. So the knife went straight into Ed’s chest. 

00:04:30
JIM BUNN And find another way. 

00:04:30
TAJAÉ GAYNOR I’ve got myself out of a lot of situations about talking and it has taken nothing away from me, nothing. I don’t know like it was… I don’t seem soft, I can easily tell (inaudible ) it’s not even a warfare. I’m not going there with you, because I already understand the process… and that’s part of the reason why I work with young people. You know, I say who better to talk to them about these things than someone who has been through it and someone who can honestly say, I know… I know how it feels, you know. 

00:05:05
WINNIE KING And joining me now is Tajaé Gaynor. You just met him and Dr. James Garbarino and he is a professor of human development at Cornell University and Dr. Garbarino has also written a book called And words Can Hurt Forever about his research into violence in the schools and welcome both of you to this show. 

00:05:25
JAMES GARBARINO Thank you. 

00:05:25
WINNIE KING Tajaé back then, what… what about your victims? You know, did you ever worry about how they felt in all of this? 

00:05:30
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Conflict Resolution Counselor You know growing up um… I got into several of you know incidents and um… I mean you know violence was one way that young people especially in an area I grew up with, there were a lot of the situations and you know when we felt threatened we used violence against other people and we really didn’t think about how it affected other people. 

00:05:50
WINNIE KING You were just trying to survive and do what you needed to do to protect yourself? 

00:05:55
TAJAÉ Yeah because in reality you know either you fought or somebody who is gonna fight you… 

00:06:00
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:06:00
TAJAÉ GAYNOR I mean the situation was gonna happen regardless, so you know you have to learn to fight. You have to be able to defend yourself. 

00:06:05
WINNIE KING Now what about people that obviously wanna threaten you, like a guy who is really tiny, who really can’t fight back or maybe even a girl, did you ever intimidate people like that? 

00:06:15
WINNIE KING I wouldn’t say I did but you know, I… I hung with people who did at different times and I think it’s part of growing up. You know, young people don’t take other people’s feelings into consideration a lot of times but it’s something you learn as you get older. 

00:06:30
WINNIE KING Yeah. Dr. Garbarino um… what Tajaé is describing is just one part of this whole thing. Tell us about all the different types of violence that children are experiencing now. 

00:06:40
JAMES GARBARINO , PhD Professor, Human Development Cornell University Most certainly the… the physical intimidation that you are talking about is a common threat, verbal intimidation and emotional abuse. Kids rank that as probably the biggest problem nation wide. As… as I think you heard, empathy is the enemy of aggression that you feel for the other you’re less likely to… to act in a violent way, so that’s part of it. These codes of conducts, these belief systems that wrap your whole self-esteem up your ability to project power. These are particularly problems for boys and they are particularly related to the issues of aggression. 

00:07:15
WINNIE KING How prevalent would you say this whole issue of intimidation or bullying in the schools really is today? 

00:07:20
JAMES GARBARINO Now the research shows that any given time maybe one in three kids is either a bully or victim or both. But about 90% of kids say bullying is something that's on their minds because even if they aren’t the victim of the bully, they are the bystander and they worry they’ll be next. They worry how they will handle it. They feel guilty they didn’t help. 

00:07:35
WINNIE KING Wow. Now Tajaé you described this sort of dance that happens with… with activities that lead to aggression or maybe someone looks at you funny… 

00:07:45
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Right. 

00:07:45
WINNIE KING …or someone says something. Tell us about that because it doesn’t just start out we’d just break out into a big fight. It sort of leads up to that because of events that happened earlier. 

00:07:55
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Right. You know, I… I feel like… I feel that a lot of fights happen out of fear. Um… and you know young people in… in feeling fear in certain situations find a way to deal with it and I call it a pre-fight dance something that happens where young people you know kind of be around a bush and kind of say well you did this to me or you did that or you looked at me funny or… you know, things of that nature to kind of figure out how the situation is… is gonna go down and a lot of times just to instigate is around that you know push the young people to fight. 

00:08:30
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:08:30
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Um… you know one thing I’ve realized is that if you give young people an alternative to find, there’s a good percentage of the time that they’ll take that instead of fighting. 

00:08:35
WINNIE KING Yeah. So it’s important I think for us to as we look at the behavior to recognize that this isn’t something that just sort of happens all out of the blue, it’s a huge surprise. Often there were some inciting events. There were something that happened earlier in the day and so if we can intervene at that point sometimes we can avert the violence. 

00:08:55
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Um… 

00:08:55
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:08:55
JAMES GARBARINO That’s a process that emerges and how people process information has a lot to do with it as well as the values they bring to the situation. 

00:09:05
WINNIE KING Okay. Now one of the more common disturbances that we see and other types of violence is bullying by a kid who pushes your child around or insults him for no apparent reason at all or maybe just because he wants something like your child’s lunch money. Are there things that your son or your daughter can do that will actually make him or her safer and better able to deal with the bully? And what can parents do to help? Well, let’s take a look. 

00:09:30
JIM BUNN Here are some things that kid can do when facing a bully. Take a deep breath and try to stay calm. Keep talking quietly. A soft voice can help calm things down. Act strong even though you may not feel strong. Don’t look down, stand up straight and walk with confidence. More important refuse to fight, say so and remember, you have a right to leave any situation if you don’t feel safe. Afterward remember you don’t have to just take it. Find a friend a parent, teacher, principal and tell them you need and want their help. Talk to your friends, get their support. Peer pressure against bullying may be the best way to stop it. If you are being bullied, make sure you are always with a friend or group of friends. For example, watch what can happen if you bring a friend with you. 

00:10:25
COURTESY: National Center for Assault Prevention 800-258-3189 

00:10:25
 (inaudible ) your lunch money. 

00:10:26
 No. 

00:10:26
TIFFANY You don’t have the right to take her lunch money away. 

00:10:30
 Who is this? 

00:10:30
 This is my friend, Tiffany. 

00:10:30
 Tiffany listen, I don’t want your lunch money. This is between Joy and I, so why would you gonna (inaudible ) the school? 

00:10:38
TIFFANY No. 

00:10:40
 Joy are you gonna get me the lunch money? 

00:10:40
 No and if you don’t stop bothering us, I’m gonna tell my mom and the teacher and whoever will help us. 

00:10:45
 Forget it. I don’t want your money anyways. You’re both babies. 

00:10:50
JIM BUNN For parents, don’t ignore the issue. Let your children know they can always come to you for help and that you will validate their feelings. Listen to your child’s issues and take them seriously. Even verbal abuse is very damaging to a child. Name the behavior as bullying and reinforce that it’s unacceptable. Make sure the child understands that being bullied is never his or her fault. Work with your child to develop positive strategies to deal with bullying like the things you’ve just seen in this video. 

00:11:25
WINNIE KING And one of the most important of course is to report it to the school principal. You can get a copy of that list on our website which is listed at the very end of this show. And Tajaé I… I wanna go back to you and talk about these suggestions you know that… that we have. When you were a bully and you were doing this, what can a parent have done or kid have done to get you off the whack? 

00:11:45
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Well you know, when I got into conflicts um… and I chose to respond in, let’s say, a violent way or you know to get into a fight um… things would have changed if I was able to see you know, the other person as a person. 

00:12:05
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:12:05
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Um… you know a lot of times like I said before I fought when… when I felt the need to fight, um… but if someone was able to show me that you know we could deal with the situation in a different way… 

00:12:15
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:12:15
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Things would have been dealt with different… 

00:12:15
WINNIE KING When you talk about how you talk and you encourage people to talk that you can kind of talk your way out of it… 

00:12:20
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Right. 

00:12:20
WINNIE KING …if you like people know that you are a human being that you’ve got feelings, you are afraid, it’s okay, let’s talk about this. James um… parents hear about the stuff sometimes from their children or from their children’s friends and they wanna do some thing. They wanna get in their car and drive to that school and tear somebody up and kids will often say, ‘oh no mom or dad, don’t do it. You just make it worse. What about that sentiment? Is that true? 

00:12:45
JAMES GARBARINO , PhD Author, "And Words Can Hurt Forever" No I think two things. One parents do need to take it seriously and show their child they will be an ally. But two, you have to be very careful of not seeming like a crazy running off on your own. This is a problem of the social system of the school has to be addressed as a social system issue, which means get together with other parents, work with the principal, to work with a group of people. So you change the climate, you change the whole process that is the standard in the school. So rather than going to war against bullies or simply empowering victims it’s about changing the whole climate and treating the bullies with respect as you get them to stop doing it. 

00:13:20
WINNIE KING Yeah. It’s tough though because kids get so frightened you know that if they bring their parents into it, it kind of shows a sign of weakness. I mean, how would you’ve reacted if you had been confronted by one of the children or kids that you were intimidating by their parents? Would that have made you feel like you need to attack the kids more? 

00:13:35
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Probably not. 

00:13:40
WINNIE KING Well now you went from being a violent offender to being a counselor… 

00:13:40
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Um… 

00:13:40
WINNIE KING …which is like incredible and fabulous and we are so glad that you did that but how on the role that you do it? 

00:13:50
TAJAÉ GAYNOR I mean it… it really wasn’t that hard you know, it’s… it’s part of growing up. It’s… it’s the process that all young people go through and you realize certain things and you realize certain choices that you made when you are younger and as you get older you realize they are not the right thing for you anymore and um… and I’ve realized and learned from different people that I can deal with situations differently and that’s… that’s… that’s all I did and you know in that process um… I think I realized my responsibility to other young people also, uou know to be able to teach them about… about choices because you know luckily for me I didn’t have to suffer big consequences. 

00:14:25
WINNIE KING That’s right. 

00:14:25
TAJAÉ GAYNOR But I had a lot of friends that did and… and you know and keeping the memory of a lot of my friends alive, I'll teach other young people how to get themselves out of those situations. 

00:14:30
WINNIE KING Yeah. That’s fabulous Tajaé. It’s just so nice to hear you say that. Joining us now are two women who do this kind of counseling and mediation to help prevent youth violence. We have Lynne Hurdle-Price. Now Lynne is a Conflict Resolution Consultant. She works with a variety of school systems and trains students in how to work their way through conflicts without resorting to violence. Welcome to the show. 

00:14:50
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE Thank you. 

00:14:50
WINNIE KING And we also joined by jury Janice Tudy-Jackson and she is a lawyer who works with both kids and adults on what’s called the Alternative Dispute Resolution or ADR. 

00:15:00
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Right. 

00:15:05
WINNIE KING And this basically means solutions other than the traditional ones imposed by the court system and Janice also teaches ADR at Columbia Law school and thank you both of you for being here and adding to this discussion. Um… what exactly Lynne do you teach? I mean, you have… we’re hearing Tajaé talk very knowledgeably what he’s been through and… and retrospectively a lot of wisdom. But what do you… what do you teach young people that are in the throws of all of this violence? 

00:15:30
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE Conflict Resolution Trainer Well, you also heard Tajaé talk about well I talk and if I can talk my way out of a situation and that’s really what we are teaching. We are teaching communication skills, how you learn to talk to people in a way that gets the results that you want. Um… we help you to look at putting yourself in the other person’s shoes and developing empathy. So we use a lot of experiences meaning active kinds of things and real kinds of role plays to help young people really look at well what is the situation that I’m facing, what can I do about it, what are my options and what are the things that I can say that can help turn the situation around… 

00:16:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:16:10
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE …and if I can’t do it in the moment then who can assist me in this process. 

00:16:15
WINNIE KING Now with this work also for the bully who is um… likely to pick on someone the weaker… the weaker person. 

00:16:20
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE One of the things that I’ve seen that’s so phenomenal is that a lot of times when you involve a young person who has been a bully in these programs, they make the best mediators, counselors because they understand the psychology of what’s really going on here and they are the ones that have used their skills and leadership in a negative way… 

00:16:35
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:16:35
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE …but can now turn it positive. 

00:16:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:16:40
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE So we invite everyone into the… the skills learning and it’s been really sensational I think. 

00:16:45
WINNIE KING Well, Janice ADR is a way… it’s a different… a different animal in the sense that you use different alternative ways. Tell us about that. 

00:16:50
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON , Esq Conflict Management Consultant Yeah, it’s interesting. Even the term, ADR, um… Alternative Dispute Resolution implies an alternative to something else. And the alternative was to the court system as you mentioned but also to the criminal justice system. But what we are looking at is appropriate dispute resolution and the whole spectrum of ways of dealing with things and intervening. Actually intervening in the disputes and the disputes might be very volatile. Um… some disputes involving homicides, you know after the homicide the conflict that um… that comes up after that and also some things that we might consider is minor. That can just blow up. 

00:17:30
WINNIE KING Right. And so you actually mediate. You actually get right in the middle of this discussion. Roll up your sleeves, I got you. 

00:17:35
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Roll up… roll up your sleeves and just to have suitcase will travel and that’s exactly I usually… sometimes I have a very little notice. 

00:17:45
WINNIE KING Really? 

00:17:45
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Yes. 

00:17:45
WINNIE KING But give me some examples of some (inaudible ) again. 

00:17:51
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Um… I have… I was contacted actually by the district attorney office and one of the (inaudible ) in New York City and they have been contacted by a principal of a school and they were concerned about World War III, two housing projects going to war against one another and they all started with two 12 years olds, two 6 graders. 

00:18:10
WINNIE KING Really? 

00:18:10
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON That’s right. 

00:18:10
WINNIE KING And what was their issue? What were they fighting about? 

00:18:15
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON The way one looked at the other. 

00:18:15
WINNIE KING Oh, well, you know that… and that does it for me, right, you know. Great going, something as simple as that? 

00:18:20
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON As simple as that but it… it… it… what happened was we actually went to the school in the morning when the girls arrive and um… use non-verbal as well as verbal communication. Sometimes the non verbal-communication can be… 

00:18:35
WINNIE KING Yes. Looking at me funny, you know. 

00:18:35
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Right. Well we use non-verbal communications in the mediations… 

00:18:40
WINNIE KING Really? 

00:18:40
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON We ask them to show us using their body, using no words how they felt… 

00:18:45
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:18:45
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON …about the situation and it was telling… 

00:18:45
WINNIE KING Wow! 

00:18:50
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON It was wonderful. 

00:18:50
WINNIE KING This is just so amazing you know. These conflict resolution and alternative dispute resolution programs show how the steps we take to respond to violence can help not only the victim but can actually help reduce the likelihood of violence in the future by affecting the behavior of the offender. Well, you know it’s not too far north of New York. In New Haven, Connecticut there is a program that is considered by many to be one of the best and most effective in the country at accomplishing both of these goals. Jim Bunn has more. 

00:19:20
 Come on. Let’s go to class folks. Let’s go… let’s go…. 

00:19:20
JIM BUNN Monday morning, Hillhouse High School, New haven, Connecticut. Word spreads that a dispute last Friday is going to result in a brawl today. Police officer Jeff Fletcher investigates. 

00:19:35
 You know where is he right now? 

00:19:40
 You have really problem with him? 

00:19:40
 Not (inaudible ) to call. 

00:19:45
 Alright. Now he didn’t… did you straighten out? 

00:19:45
JIM BUNN You might think what you just saw is a New Haven police officer responding to the report of possible violence on a high school campus and in some respects that is what you saw. But here in New Haven they don’t even consider them police officers on high school campuses. They consider them resource officers. 

00:20:05
LONNIE GARRIS, JR Principal, Hillhouse High School The idea of having the policemen in the school I thought would provide a negative connotation about Hillhouse High School. It’s absolute(ph) resistant. 

00:20:10
JIM BUNN It’s part of a community-wide program designed to help kids heal from the emotional impact of violence. They call it CD-CP, because it combines child development with community policing. 

00:20:25
STEVE MARANS , PhD Program Founder, CD-CP One of the um… greatest predictors for poor outcomes in terms of children’s exposure to violence is that nobody recognizes either that what they’ve seen or the psychological impact of what they’ve seen. 

00:20:40
JIM BUNN Here is how it works. Police officers receive ten weeks of special training from Yale University Child Development professionals who in turn has spent at least 40 hours riding with police officers on patrol. Officers like Carlos Colon and a 11-year veteran, he spent the last 6 years in the CD-CP program. He says things like domestic violence cause are now handled very differently. 

00:21:05
OFFICER CARLOS COLON New Haven Police Department Before it was just you went into a house, you, let’s say arrest somebody and then that was the last you saw them, of them until the situation came back. Now if we end up going to a… an incident, make an arrest that’s not the last time we see them. We have a program set up where we go back a few days later and we find out how the family is doing. They know that we are coming back and making sure everything is okay. We are following up on the cases. 

00:21:30
JIM BUNN The results dramatic reductions in discipline problems in city schools, truancy, even teen pregnancies and for those who are initially skeptical important intangibles. 

00:21:40
LONNIE GARRIS, JR Kids really hustle and get to class on time. Ah… kids making every effort to do better academically. Ah… People saying yes sir and… and no sir. I think it impacts the total environment of the school. 

00:21:55
WINNIE KING Well you know James this New Haven project seems to be working. But what’s even more interesting is that it seems to affect all the players. 

00:22:05
JAMES GARBARINO I think the most important thing in all of this is that there nothing is fixed. Um… people say put cops in school and they will take care of it. It depends on who the cop is, how he is trained, what he thinks, what he feels. All this can change people’s roles. This young man changed his role. People change their roles if we’re open to change and that’s really the starting point to make a difference. 

00:22:25
WINNIE KING Yeah. Well, Janice we heard that your ADR program really focuses on rehabilitating and not focusing on the criminal aspect of the behavior. What’s your take on this New Haven program? 

00:22:35
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Esq Mediator It’s interesting. Um… I’m familiar with the… with that program. And um… as it’s been said by changing the roles um… changing the expectations, okay, um… it can make such a difference. But I mean there’s… there’s something that’s unique about this. These officers have been trained. 

00:22:55
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:22:55
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Okay. What they are doing is counter to the larger culture… 

00:23:00
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:23:00
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON …in the police force and… and that’s something that we have to realize. 

00:23:05
WINNIE KING Yeah. Now Lynne with your conflict resolution training, um… there are different ways to handle the problem. You don’t just have one way of handling all of the problems. What are the different programs out there? 

00:23:15
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE Well there are different programs. For instance, Tajaé mentioned earlier, ah… Effective Alternatives for Reconciliation services, which is in an organization that teaches conflict resolution on many levels, which a lot of programs do. Peer mediation, where young people are taught to mediate with their peers. So there is an opportunity to emphasize really with the person who is in a conflict, the person who is the victim or the perpetrator. There is also conflict resolution where you are really teaching the whole school the skills. So you go into the classrooms and you work with students in class, you work with teachers, their programs that really teach curriculums on conflict resolution. 

00:23:55
WINNIE KING Yeah. You know the thing that I keep hearing, listening to all of these programs, listening to you is that there is reason for hope in all of this. You know, so many kids find themselves in a situation where they just feel hopeless that something horrible is going to happen to them. Their parents can’t help them. They are just in such trouble and here these fabulous programs are out here and people that are dedicated to studying this, people that have changed their lives and are now on a different course. There is reason for hope. You don’t have to feel that you are sort of on a slippery slope with all of this. 

00:24:25
JANICE TUDY-JACKSON Absolutely, absolutely. 

00:24:25
LYNNE HURDLE-PRICE I think it’s important to the parents to understand that there are these problems out there. So they can go into the schools and advocate for them and one of the things if you are looking at how to help your child who is being bullied, then ask what are the conflict resolution programs that we have in the school and go to the folks who are running them for assistance. 

00:24:40

00:25:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. What would you say to bullies to… you know no one owns up to being a bully but they know who they are. What would you say to them? What would you want them to know? 

00:25:15
TAJAÉ GAYNOR Well before I answer that question I just wanna say one thing and that’s you know um… young people who decide to bully, a lot of times have their own issues that they are dealing with and sometimes that’s one way that they… they act out those type of issues that they have. One I would say adults really need to get involved and be able to help those young people deal with those issues. And I think when… when adults and you know other people, school fight to get involved they can help a bully realize that they are a person and… and realizing that they are a person and you know we all have issues, they can then help them to realize that other people need to be treated with the same respect. 

00:25:55
