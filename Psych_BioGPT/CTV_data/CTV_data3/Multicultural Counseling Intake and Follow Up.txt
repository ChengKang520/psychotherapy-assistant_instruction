Umm… In… In this… this session you’ll notice that we can build off some of the other things that we talked about the first time around, umm… again trying to focus on… on some of the ways that we could talk about her presenting problem, understand some of the other factors and as well as talking on may be some of the… the cultural factors that might be influencing her problem. So I hope you enjoy the videos. 

00:01:35
Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Karol 

00:01:40
KEVIN NADAL So Karol tell me a little bit about why you came into see me today? 

00:01:40
KAROL I’ve been trying really hard to focus on school and balance my life. 

00:01:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:01:50
KAROL Umm… I got to school in the morning and I work in the afternoon and I take care of my son and then I stay up doing my home work and studying. Umm… And after that long day it’s kind of hard to get to sleep. 

00:02:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:00
KAROL So I’ve been drinking a glass of wine to help me go to sleep. 

00:02:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:05
KAROL And then it’s two and then it’s three. And, yeah, I’m getting nervous that with all that going on that a lot of things that happened in my past are just gonna start coming up again. 

00:02:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure! What are type of things that happened in your past before? 

00:02:20
KAROL Well, before I started college I was undocumented which mean… meant that I didn’t have the money to go to college and I wasn’t eligible for financial aid and all my friends were in college. Umm… So I felt like a looser and I started kind of getting depressed and down with myself. Umm… And there was really nothing to do. And I started hanging out with different people and experimenting with drugs. And that kind of depression turned into a mania… 

00:02:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:02:50
KAROL I don’t know if I’ve be with a diagnosis or not. 

00:02:50
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:02:50
KAROL But I got to the point that I was in the hospital. 

00:02:55
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:02:55
KAROL And they diagnosed me as bipolar. 

00:02:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:02:55
KAROL And I learned a little bit about it, and not being able to sleep is one of the symptoms. 

00:03:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:00
KAROL Umm… And I can’t afford to be sick, you know. 

00:03:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:03:05
KAROL I’m… I’m finally in school now, which is what I wanted. 

00:03:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:03:05
KAROL And I have my son. 

00:03:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:03:10
KAROL So I… I figure, if I start counseling now and… and figure out how to deal with it… 

00:03:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:15
KAROL …it’s not gonna get worse. It’s not gonna escalate to where, I mean, the hospital again. 

00:03:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… And so, it sounds like you’re taking a really good step in… in recognizing umm… that this might turn into a problem and… and one need to prevent that. So I think that’s a really brave thing for you to do to come here and… and seek help. Umm… And it also sounds like you… you have a lot going on for you? I mean, how does it feel to… to have all these stressors and umm… having your son and having to deal with all this? 

00:03:40
KAROL Well, I mean, thanks for saying that I’m brave, because… 

00:03:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:45
KAROL …you know, my father thinks like counseling is… 

00:03:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:03:45
KAROL You know, excuse me, it’s bullshit, you know, what’re you… you need the counselor, you know, do your work. 

00:03:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:03:55
KAROL Go to work. 

00:03:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:03:55
KAROL Go to church on Sunday you will be fine, you know, what do they know. 

00:03:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah. 

00:04:00
KAROL Umm… And I did feel that way… 

00:04:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:04:00
KAROL …two years ago when this whole process started. 

00:04:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:04:05
KAROL Umm… But after taking the medicine and after doing a few sessions, I did feel better and I was able to get to this place. 

00:04:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:04:10
KAROL So, I mean, it… it’s my life, you know, this is… 

00:04:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:04:15
KAROL The people around me, that’s my father's always worked, you know, as immigrants we always worked. And if you want… 

00:04:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:04:20
KAROL …to go to school you did both. 

00:04:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:04:25
KAROL But then when I go to school and kids are driving to school and… 

00:04:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:04:25
KAROL …you know, they’re not working. All they do is… 

00:04:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:04:30
KAROL …you know, they go to class and they get high afterwards and do their homework and that’s kind of it. 

00:04:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:04:35
KAROL Then… Then I feel like, wow, I really have a lot in my plate. 

00:04:35
KEVIN NADAL Okay, yeah. So you mentioned that your father might not view counseling as being some thing that’s ah… that’s a great option then you said, umm… that you also said that he is an immigrant, that your family is an immigrant family. Can you tell me a little bit about umm… where your family immigrated from? And… And how long they’ve been here in the U.S. and some of those experiences? 

00:04:55
KAROL Umm… So… It’s a long story but umm… we came from Columbia. 

00:05:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:00
KAROL And umm… my father came here first undocumented. 

00:05:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:05:05
KAROL And then brought my sister and I, my mom over. 

00:05:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:05
KAROL And you know, he worked three jobs to raise the money. It’s thousands of dollars to get someone here. He worked three jobs to get here and to get us here. Umm… You know my mother always worked and I’ve even worked. I would rake peoples lawns or go with my mom to clean houses and offices. 

00:05:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:25
KAROL And besides allowing education, that’s also why I’m in college. You know, that’s not… that’s why my parents brought us here. 

00:05:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:05:30
KAROL So that we would be able to move beyond that point. 

00:05:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:35
KAROL Umm… So, succeeding in school is… is very, very important. 

00:05:40
KEVIN NADAL Great. So you have all these pressures that you have umm… in terms of doing well in school and taking care of your son and then you have umm… these family pressures and umm… to do well in school, get the education, because your… your family did immigrate here to try to provide a better life for you. I mean, and just, I just want to get a sense of how this all does feel to… to have to tackle all these things? 

00:06:05
KAROL Sometimes I, you know, I… I feel sorry for myself. 

00:06:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:06:05
KAROL And sometimes I feel like it’s… it’s not about me, you know, it’s about everybody. I mean, I want this, you know, but I’ve gotto do this for my family. 

00:06:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:15
KAROL You know, I… I’m the oldest. So, I’ve got to hurry up and graduate and I have to get the great job. 

00:06:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:06:20
KAROL And I have to help my parents buy the house and I have to set things up… 

00:06:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah… 

00:06:25
KAROL for my brothers and sister. 

00:06:25
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:06:30
KAROL So even though I want it, it feels like it’s not for me, like it’s for everybody. 

00:06:35
KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah. 

00:06:35
KAROL Umm… So it, you know… it… it feels heavy… 

00:06:35
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:06:35
KAROL …on my shoulders sometimes. 

00:06:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. And that sounds like a lot of responsibility to have to… to… to… to have to take care of all these different people in your life. 

00:06:45
KAROL But then I feel guilty, because, you know, I’m in college now. 

00:06:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:50
KAROL You know, there was times where, you know, there were so much we didn’t have. 

00:06:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:06:55
KAROL So, I have what I want now. What am I complaining about? 

00:06:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:55
KAROL So it’s kind of like just, shut up, drink a glass of wine, go to sleep and do it again tomorrow. 

00:07:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. So, sometimes drinking that glass of wine helps you to cope with some of these feelings, yeah. Umm… So, when right before you’re about to… to drink your… your glass of wine, what… what goes on in your head? 

00:07:15
KAROL Well, it… it just finally stop. 

00:07:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:15
KAROL You know my mind races all day. 

00:07:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:20
KAROL You know, it’s the… the alarm goes off at 6am, you know, make breakfast, pack lunches, get dressed. 

00:07:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:25
KAROL Drop Eliza at school, get to class, you know. And then in school, it’s all about school. And I don’t just, you know, take classes and I’m also joined the United Latino Organization. 

00:07:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:35
KAROL And we do you know, breast cancer walks, like I’m involved in a lot of different things. 

00:07:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:40
KAROL Umm… And then the school day is over and then it’s rushing back to pick Eliza up, make dinner. 

00:07:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:07:45
KAROL Sometimes I go to my parents house for dinner and then… 

00:07:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:07:50
KAROL …hear them arguing about whatever is going on… 

00:07:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:50
KAROL With my family’s house and some of my old friends that I, you know, when I wasn’t in school, when I was kind of feeling down and doing things I shouldn’t be doing sometimes they show up. 

00:08:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:05
KAROL You know, like, oh, you know, it’s Thursday night, let’s hang out and I’m like… 

00:08:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:05
KAROL …I can’t do that anymore. 

00:08:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:08:10
KAROL Umm… But I want to. 

00:08:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:10
KAROL You know, I’m still young. I still wanna do those things. Umm… So it’s going, going, going, going. And then finally, house is clean, baby is asleep, homework is done, studying is done. 

00:08:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:08:20
KAROL Umm… And my body feels tired, but my mind is still going. 

00:08:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:30
KAROL So, a glass of wine will help me just to kind of sit and… 

00:08:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:35
KAROL …be, you know, but… but then that are just kind of helps me sit and be and then I need another one to relax and then another one to fall asleep. 

00:08:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:40
KAROL But then if I… when I wake up the next morning, I feel like I had, you know, I’m hung over, like well, I had three glasses of wine last night. 

00:08:50
KEVIN NADAL Right, yeah. 

00:08:50
KAROL You know, I’m a lightweight, I get drunk really easy. 

00:08:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… So I know that you’ve been talking a lot about, you know, all these… these pressures that you have and how in such a busy day and your mind is racing although until the end of the day. What's it like talking about that with me right now here? 

00:09:05
KAROL I didn’t realize until you asked me that I felt, umm… that I felt like it wasn’t fair. 

00:09:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:15
KAROL And then that… that I felt guilty about thinking and feeling it wasn’t fair. 

00:09:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah. 

00:09:20
KAROL You know, I hadn’t had… I’ve never really sat down and thought about it. I was just doing it. 

00:09:25
KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:09:25
KAROL So, it sounds like, oh yeah! I got some kind of feeling sorry for myself. 

00:09:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:30
KAROL And then mad at myself for feeling sorry for myself. So it’s… 

00:09:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:35
KAROL It’s the first time I really put those feelings into words… 

00:09:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:35
KAROL …because I don’t. 

00:09:40
KEVIN NADAL You don’t get a chance of talking about those feelings out loud? 

00:09:40
KAROL Yeah! I mean, my friends are, you know, they don’t have kids and… 

00:09:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:50
KAROL Umm… Some of them are immigrants, but not all of them. And… And it’s just, when we talk we talk about, you know, social fun things… And I trust them, but I wouldn’t necessarily talk to them about this. 

00:10:00
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:10:00
KAROL And I can’t tell my parents. 

00:10:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:05
KAROL You know, I’m the eldest, like I need to be strong. 

00:10:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:05
KAROL I need to… I already screwed up two years ago when I was feeling manic and experimenting with drugs so… 

00:10:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:10
KAROL Kind of like that’s your one chance to make mistake and now you gotto, you have to do what you have to do. 

00:10:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:15
KAROL Umm… So I never really, you know, I never really put it in line like that. 

00:10:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:25
KAROL Like, oh, I’m feeling like this and then that’s why I’m drinking wine. 

00:10:30
KEVIN NADAL Great, great! 

00:10:30
KAROL Which helps but then doesn’t. 

00:10:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure! And it sounds also like there… there are a lot of these conflicting emotions. So, you feel sorry for yourself and then you feel guilty for feeling sorry about yourself and then you feel like you have to think about your family but you wanna be selfish and then you want to go back to your family, and all these different things that go… go on. Umm… You know, what's that like to… to have these… these emotions that constantly conflict with each other and then maybe one triggers something else? 

00:11:00
KAROL Well, I think the first feeling I have is it’s kind of scary. 

00:11:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:05
KAROL Because I… I don’t… I have to be focused. 

00:11:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:10
KAROL I don’t have room. You know, it’s like there is not another chance. So, I don’t want these emotions to bring me to a place where I’m depressed again or I don’t want my busy day and my racing mind to bring me to bring me to a negative place. 

00:11:20
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:11:20
KAROL So, I… I guess that’s what brought me here. 

00:11:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:11:25
KAROL It’s… It’s fear. You know I… I don’t want all these feelings to… to paralyze me. 

00:11:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:30
KAROL And umm… Even though that’s feeling numb is… is sometimes a good thing. 

00:11:35
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:11:35
KAROL I feel like, okay you can let go of it, but I… 

00:11:40
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:11:40
KAROL I don’t wanna go to that place. 

00:11:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah! And so again I just wanted to… to reiterate just how… how brave you are for coming here, because it sounds like you really wanna make sure that you’re not gonna enter that place, and so I do think that. You know that is something… 

00:11:55
KAROL It didn’t feel brave at first, but you saying it now, I’m like yeah. 

00:12:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah! 

00:12:00
KAROL Umm… Yeah, because it’s, you know, it’s crazy alright. Like, oh there is crazy Karol, you know, she’s going to counselor. 

00:12:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:12:10
KAROL So, it didn’t feel brave but it… 

00:12:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:12:10
KAROL It feels a little better now. 

00:12:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah! I mean, it’s gets me to think about your family and… and how your family, umm… not only how they view counseling, but also just see, you know, some of these family values that you may have particularly coming from a Columbia and a Latino family, umm… the… the pressures that you may experience. I’m wondering if you could tell me just a little bit about umm… some of these, how these cultural expectations umm… might impact a lot of these issues in your life? 

00:12:40
KAROL Well, umm… being part of it a lot of my peers like my white friends are like, oh my god you’re, you know, so young and you have a kid and you’re married! You know, my Latino friends understand, oh you’re married because you needed your papers. 

00:13:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:00
KAROL And, you know, a lot of the people I group didn’t have babies. 

00:13:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure! 

00:13:00
KAROL So, it’s… You know, it’s kind of like living in two worlds. And my father, he expects me to do well. He says… 

00:13:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:10
KAROL …education is important, umm… because I’m the eldest. But he also expects me to get married and do a lot of traditional things. 

00:13:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:20
KAROL So, it’s kind of constantly dancing between the two… 

00:13:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:20
KAROL …you know. So, when… when I’m in school, he has really patted me when I do well and… and… and get honors for certain things. But if I wanna, you know, run for President of an organization, he’s like, what… what kind of women do that? You know, how you can find a boyfriend like that? You are always… 

00:13:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:40
KAROL …doing stuff. Like how are you gonna get a boy friend? How you gonna keep your husband? Like, you need to go home and cook. So, I guess the cultural piece… I… I… think I do well dancing between the two. 

00:13:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:50
KAROL But it is always dancing between the two. 

00:13:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure! 

00:13:55
KAROL It’s always balancing one with the other. 

00:13:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:55
KAROL And with the… the mental health piece, it’s umm… You know in Columbia there is always like, la loca, like the… 

00:14:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:05
KAROL …town crazy lady. Umm… And she is eccentric and dresses funny and… and… and she’s accepted. 

00:14:10
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:14:10
KAROL So, my family teases me that way. 

00:14:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:14:10
KAROL Because… Because, I mean, I was manic. So, they say, you know cut away the la loca or friends will be like, crazy Karol. 

00:14:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:20
KAROL And it’s kind of funny. But it’s not… it’s not accepted that way here. 

00:14:25
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:14:25
KAROL Here… I mean, here in the States. 

00:14:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:25
KAROL But in my house it’s different. So… 

00:14:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:30
KAROL It’s kind of like something that my family has accepted. 

00:14:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:35
KAROL But it’s a secret, you know, you don’t tell anybody else… 

00:14:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:40
KAROL …that Karol has been in the hospital or she is going to counseling, because that’s… 

00:14:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:14:45
KAROL So it’s… it’s strange. It’s strange to dance between those two places. 

00:14:45
KEVIN NADAL Sure! I mean, I’m hearing a lot of things, but you know there is these two directions that maybe we can go into. One is… is talking about these family expectations. And… And I’m especially hearing umm… gender roles and… and the… the importance of maybe marianismo and… and… 

00:15:00
KAROL Oh yeah! 

00:15:00
KEVIN NADAL …the expectation for you as a woman to… to able to succeed, but at the same time, you know, maintain these traditional gender roles of being a mother and a daughter and a wife and all these other things. And so that’s the one direction that… that I’d like to explore. And then another direction is this, is being able to just talk about what it’s like to have been diagnosed with umm… this mental health issue and umm… and some of the feelings that you have about that regarding umm… how your family might perceive it and… and just how you’ve been… been able to handle all these things? So let’s… What is… Is there a direction that you’d like to… to talk about first? But I… I definitely would like to talk about both if that if that will be okay with you? 

00:15:40
KAROL Okay. Well, for being a woman, I think it’s easier to talk about. 

00:15:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:15:45
KAROL So, I can… I can start there. 

00:15:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:45
KAROL Umm… That’s always been, because I’m the oldest, I’m kind of allowed to be a tom boy a little bit. 

00:15:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:55
KAROL And… But I was, you know, I was never allowed to play soccer. Girls just don’t play soccer. 

00:15:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:00
KAROL And it was a huge fight just to let my dad to let me play basketball, which I love and I did play. 

00:16:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:05
KAROL Umm… And I was allowed to play, but then in high school it’s like, what, you know you’re getting to be a young lady now you can’t… 

00:16:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:10
KAROL …be going around playing basketball now. 

00:16:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:15
KAROL Umm… So I… I guess the way I’ve done it is, you know, I… I do try to succeed and I do want… I can… I can pursue education, I mean that’s something my… my family and my father specifically values. Umm… But there is a lot other things that… 

00:16:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:30
KAROL There is that way, yeah, you know, like you can go to school and you can work, but you gotto come home and make dinner. 

00:16:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:35
KAROL Because that’s what women do. 

00:16:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:40
KAROL Umm… And you can work, but there is a lot of places you can’t work. 

00:16:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:16:40
KAROL Because women shouldn’t be working there. 

00:16:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:45
KAROL I mean, I have a friend who owns a restaurant. Umm… It’s a restaurant but… and they have the liquor license, and I wanted to work there and you would make lots of money there. 

00:16:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:55
KAROL And my father is like, no only umm… you know, slutty women work at bars. You can’t work at a bar. I’m a bartender, like you learn to bartend. Like ah… You know, if I… Right now I’m a pre-school teacher… 

00:17:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:05
KAROL …which is an acceptable women’s profession. 

00:17:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:10
KAROL Umm… I could make double or triple bartending. 

00:17:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:15
KAROL And cut out the time. I would have a lot more time. 

00:17:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:15
KAROL Because I could bartend two nights a week and make what I make as a pre-school teacher’s assistant. 

00:17:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:20
KAROL But Latino women, that are bartend, no… it’s like no like… My dad would disown me, like… 

00:17:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:17:30
KAROL He thinks, you know slutty women bartend. 

00:17:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:30
KAROL So, it creeps into areas of my life that I don’t even… Yeah, I don’t waste time on it, because it’s just kind of that’s the way it is. 

00:17:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:40
KAROL But now saying it to you like now I’m pissed off. 

00:17:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:17:45
KAROL Like, why should I work five days a week and get paid less when I could just work two days a week and get paid more? It doesn’t make sense. Just because I’m a woman and women don’t do that. 

00:17:55
KEVIN NADAL Right, right! 

00:17:55
KAROL Umm… 

00:17:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I notice that you… you started to get a little emotional and… when talking about this. So, let’s identify, what's that emotion you said you feel pissed off or there other feelings that you may have? 

00:18:05
KAROL I’m mostly pissed off. 

00:18:05
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:18:10
KAROL Umm… It’s… You know, I love my father very much. And I… You know, I… I want him to be proud of me and I… And a lot of what I do is… is in gratitude to him. I mean, he has no idea. I mean… 

00:18:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:20
KAROL He crossed the border into this country like, through the river, you know, beaten by cops the whole thing. 

00:18:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:25
KAROL Stuff you see on TV. 

00:18:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:30
KAROL So, I’m grateful for him. And we left… You know, Columbia has been in a civil war for 40 years. 

00:18:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:35
KAROL You know, my cousin’s grandma was kidnapped. My cousin was shot in face. I mean, we… We needed to leave, you know. So I… I feel like I owe him. 

00:18:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:45
KAROL But at the same time, alright where do I draw. You know, when… 

00:18:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:50
KAROL What am I gonna be able to just do my own thing and not owe him so much? 

00:18:55
KEVIN NADAL Great, great! And how… how does it feel to… to even say that out loud? 

00:19:00
KAROL Impossible. 

00:19:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:19:00
KAROL It feels like it’s just always gonna be loud, yeah, you know… 

00:19:05
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:19:05
KAROL Umm… And in maybe when… you know, when I have a degree. 

00:19:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:10
KAROL And… But it’s always gonna… I mean, I know, he wants me to graduate, but he is like, okay well, when are you gonna have a real marriage and you know have a husband and have grandkids and the whole thing I need you know? 

00:19:25
KEVIN NADAL So the emphasis is again on a real marriage? 

00:19:25
KAROL Yeah. 

00:19:25
KEVIN NADAL That… 

00:19:25
KAROL Right. 

00:19:25
KEVIN NADAL What you are doing right now is that? 

00:19:25
KAROL What I’m doing right now is, you know I married a guy that I was dating, so that I could get papers, that I could go to college… 

00:19:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:19:35
KAROL and we were dating and then I got pregnant. 

00:19:35
KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:19:40
KAROL Umm… 

00:19:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! I mean, so… I mean, it sounds like there is… there is a lot going on there that you have a lot of feelings about it. I mean, and it sounds like maybe you don’t have the opportunity to… to vent this out louder or share this out loud? 

00:19:55
KAROL I’ve said to my father a few things but umm… 

00:19:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:00
KAROL He always blames it on, you know America like… 

00:20:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:20:00
KAROL Well, that’s how they do it here in America, but that’s not how we do it. 

00:20:05
KEVIN NADAL Right, right! 

00:20:05
KAROL You know, women in America do this. You know, they… they’re loose women or they are cold women, you know Columbian women are so emotional. They’re so giving, they are so nurturing. So, isn’t that the type of women you wanna be? I mean, these sort of the things he says to me. 

00:20:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Well! So you mentioned that your father says things like, well that’s how things are done here in the U.S. and that it is different from back home in Columbia. Umm… And that… that reminds me that second topic that to talk about was just his idea of seeking mental health and, or ah… talking about your problem seeking counseling. Umm… And maybe how that might be viewed as more than American thing and not as a Columbian thing? 

00:20:45
KAROL Oh very much so! 

00:20:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:45
KAROL I mean… 

00:20:45
KEVIN NADAL And then what they’ve, yeah… What's that like? 

00:20:50
KAROL Well, for example, when things were just very different. So, when… Like I said I feel like my mind races sometimes. 

00:21:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:00
KAROL Umm… And I never express it with my family. Umm… And much less now, but two years ago I would just non-stop, non-stop. 

00:21:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:10
KAROL But I was able to keep up. You know, whatever idea I would have, I would do it and go through with it and I would succeed and then I’d jump on another thing. 

00:21:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:21:15
KAROL Umm… And in my… That’s what you do. 

00:21:25
KEVIN NADAL Yes. 

00:21:25
KAROL You know, you’re always working. And my father worked three jobs. So what am I complaining about doing ten things at once. 

00:21:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:21:30
KAROL You know, that’s what you do. 

00:21:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:30
KAROL Umm… Once it was clear that like, Karol sounds she is paranoid, you know. 

00:21:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:35
KAROL Karol sounds strange. Those critics are not to me. We call my mandarino, which is my godmother. 

00:21:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:40
KAROL Umm… You know, and my grandma is praying for me doing the Rosario, which is like a… this long… 

00:21:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:21:50
KAROL …the long beads and you… you know you do the rosary. 

00:21:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:55
KAROL Umm… We… You know my aunts come in and… and take me out and talk to me. You don’t call a counselor like it’s sort of… 

00:22:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:00
KAROL …not their business. 

00:22:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:00
KAROL And you don’t drug people. You know, you don’t stick pills in them. You know, you… you have teas and… 

00:22:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:10
KAROL And baths and you know rest. 

00:22:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:10
KAROL So, it was totally different. And I like the way my family does it much better anyway. 

00:22:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:22:15
KAROL I mean, I didn’t want to be in hospital with, you know, hopped up on pills and… 

00:22:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:20
KAROL …and zombified. 

00:22:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:25
KAROL Which is why I stopped the counseling in the first place, because the counselor was encouraging me to continue medication. 

00:22:30
KEVIN NADAL I see! 

00:22:30
KAROL And I can’t… You know I… There is a part of me that, you know, this is my life. I like being able to do… 

00:22:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:40
KAROL …hundred things in one day. 

00:22:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:40
KAROL You know, when they give you umm… forgot the name of… of the medicine but… 

00:22:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:50
KAROL Think ones in this Risperdal, one was Lithum. You know, when they give me that medication you are like a zombie. 

00:22:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:22:55
KAROL So you can’t do ten things in one day. 

00:22:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:22:55
KAROL Let alone a hundred. 

00:22:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:55
KAROL Umm… 

00:23:00
KEVIN NADAL And maybe that doesn’t fit in with what you do need to do… 

00:23:00
KAROL Right. 

00:23:00
KEVIN NADAL …especially with all the different roles that you have in your life. 

00:23:05
KAROL Right! So, I mean, I don’t want to get to the point where I’m paranoid and hearing voices or seeing things. 

00:23:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:10
KAROL I obviously don’t want to get there. And I think as long as I avoid drugs and maintain a healthy lifestyle that… 

00:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:15
KAROL …that I can… I can stay away from that. 

00:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:23:20
KAROL Umm… And I had one counselor that said, you know, you… you can try to do it naturally. You know, you go to counseling, stay away from drugs, exercise your body. 

00:23:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:30
KAROL Stay away from wine, which I’m obviously not doing. 

00:23:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:35
KAROL Uh… They mentioned to make a three vitamins, like things that, you know, listen to your grandma, take the teas, take the baths. 

00:23:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:40
KAROL So… So far it’s been kind of working, but now like I said I’m scared that… 

00:23:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:23:50
KAROL I’m slipping into using the wine instead of the teas and the baths and whatever else. 

00:23:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:23:55
KAROL My family would… would approve of. 

00:23:55
KEVIN NADAL Right! Yeah, I mean, and one thing I wanted to as far as that you, at the beginning of the session you said umm… that perhaps he didn’t agree with their diagnosis. Umm… Can you tell me little bit more about that? 

00:24:10
KAROL Well, I was pregnant at the time. 

00:24:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:15
KAROL So, that was one of the things that like my mandarino and my… my grandma would say like, well it’s your hormones, women go crazy when they are pregnant… 

00:24:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:20
KAROL …some women umm… And I did. I looked it up. And it’s very few, but some women do actually have hallucinations when they’re pregnant. 

00:24:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:30
KAROL Umm… And I was also… The guy that I was dating, that I married, but it’s not really my husband, you know, he left. He didn’t wanna have a baby. 

00:24:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:35
KAROL So, of course I was depressed. I mean this… 

00:24:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:24:40
KAROL I’m… I’m so young. I mean, you know 18 pregnant, a relationship and he leaves. Umm… I’m undocumented and that’s depressing, you know… 

00:24:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:24:45
KAROL I… I can’t do what my peers are doing or meet the lifestyle like the life time milestones that I feel it should be. Umm… And I still have to maintain, you know, I still have to pay the rent, I still have to do all the other things. 

00:25:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:00
KAROL So, part me feels like, well of course I was depressed and of course my mind is racing. 

00:25:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:05
KAROL And the pregnancy then would explain in a way some of the stuff that isn’t so normal. 

00:25:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:10
KAROL And in other times I think, no! 

00:25:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:15
KAROL You’re different. You know, there is something wrong with you. And the medicine did change… 

00:25:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:20
KAROL …the situation. 

00:25:20
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:25:20
KAROL You know, taking… Being in the hospital, having therapy, taking medicine did bring me back to a so called normal place. 

00:25:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:30
KAROL So maybe… maybe they’re alright and maybe… 

00:25:30
KEVIN NADAL I see! 

00:25:30
KAROL Maybe I am bipolar. 

00:25:35
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:25:35
KAROL But umm… You know it’s… it’s not how I define myself. 

00:25:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:40
KAROL It’s not how I want to define myself. 

00:25:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:40
KAROL Some still struggling with that. 

00:25:45
KEVIN NADAL Struggling with that, yeah. 

00:25:45
KAROL You know, I don’t… I don’t know if I am, if I am not. 

00:25:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:50
KAROL And… And like I said there is a part of it that I don’t… I don’t wanna let go. I mean, I don’t know what goes on in another people’s minds but… 

00:25:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:55
KAROL …I like being able to have a lot of ideas and go through with them all the time. 

00:26:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:00
KAROL You know, I… I don’t like that zombie feeling at all. 

00:26:05
KEVIN NADAL Great! Yeah, it almost seems like that there is even a cultural influence on how you view these things because perhaps umm… this American value or influence can… can help you to see that, oh this is a diagnosis and this is what a lot of people experience and then there is also this… this other part of you that says, no I don’t think there was anything wrong and may be that might be involved that Columbian and Latino or Latino value of that you could solve mental health issues with umm… with things like prayer and teas and baths and everything else that you had mentioned. 

00:26:40
KAROL Right. 

00:26:40
KEVIN NADAL Umm… But it also sounds like one of the issues is… is even just getting that label and being labeled with by bipolar and… 

00:26:45
KAROL Yeah. 

00:26:45
KEVIN NADAL And that must have, you know caused some reaction in you. What was that? What was that like to get that label? 

00:26:55
KAROL It was just like, well I… The label wasn’t the thing that bothered me the most. I remember a psychiatrist saying to me, you’re gonna take this pill, Lithium I think or a medicine or a liquid whatever… 

00:27:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:05
KAROL …for the rest of your life. 

00:27:10
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:27:10
KAROL And whatever to maintain a normal level. And that… I think I started crying. I mean, that was so horrible I thought. Like you know what, you are crazy… 

00:27:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:27:15
KAROL …if you think I’m going to take pills for the rest of my life. 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:20
KAROL Like, no! 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:27:20
KAROL And I still feel that way. 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:27:25
KAROL So and… And that’s… Whenever I would start therapy and I would stop, because the minute that they tell me you have to take this pill… 

00:27:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:30
KAROL …you know, like alright I'm done with you. 

00:27:35
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:27:35
KAROL You know… 

00:27:35
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:27:35
KAROL If it gets to the… And I’ve told my family that if it’s gets to the point where you see that I’m really loosing it, like if you think I’m hallucinating or delusional, and then you need to force me to take medicine then you do that. 

00:27:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:27:50
KAROL But, you know, I don’t… The prayer does work. And the… You know, the baths do work and the teas do work. I mean, I’m here, right and I’m fine. So… 

00:28:00
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:28:00
KAROL But then I’m scared like what if I’m not fine? 

00:28:00
KEVIN NADAL Right, yeah. 

00:28:05
KAROL So, it’s, yeah. It’s haven’t made peace with… with either side of it. 

00:28:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure. 

00:28:10
KAROL You know, maybe I’m just… maybe I’m just not accepting something that’s really could help me. Maybe I should take the pill. 

00:28:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… I mean, it sounds like what you’re doing right now is that you are being, you are able to manage umm… all of these different things umm… that you ah… you’re using the support of your family umm… to help you identify whether there is a problem and utilizing their support and… and… and it sounds like you would be open and they told you that. 

00:28:35
KAROL Hmm… 

00:28:35
KEVIN NADAL You know, that there was something umm… wrong or if they notice that, you know maybe you’re experiencing delusions or… or anything like that. So, I mean, again that’s a good stuff as being able to utilize your family umm… in that respect. I mean, it also… 

00:28:50
KAROL We have a very close family. I mean, I can… They’re… They’re there. 

00:28:55
KEVIN NADAL And I could hear that. It sounds like your family is… is very cohesive and united in a lot of ways. And so I think that that’s a definitely a strength for you. Umm… You know, and I also hear, you know this idea of these alternative forms of… of healing, you know. I mean, in the talking about the baths and the prayer and that sort of thing. I mean, that could be very helpful as well. And I know that in a lot of Latino cultures specifically that’s found to be something that could really help people heal when they have these mental health issues. Umm… And at the same time, I… I think it’s also great that you are coming here, you know, coming to counseling. So you could have all of these different ways of handling or managing umm… your mental health issues. 

00:29:35
KAROL Yeah, I think a little bit of everything will… will help me, you know. 

00:29:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:40
KAROL Just balance it. 

00:29:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:29:45
KAROL I mean, I remember one counselor said, did you ever try meditating? 

00:29:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:45
KAROL And I had never tried meditating before. 

00:29:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:29:50
KAROL Umm… So I… You know, I researched a little bit about it and with meditation, there is one type of meditation where you use beads… 

00:30:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:00
KAROL And you know, you do chants and you count the beads and there is a hundred made beads like Buddhist meditation. 

00:30:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:05
KAROL It’s what my grandma does. 

00:30:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:05
KAROL With the rosary. 

00:30:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:05
KAROL You know, I’m not chanting, you know, mantras but I’m it’s… if you ever heard… 

00:30:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:30:15
KAROL At Rosario it… it sings on me, you know… 

00:30:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:15
KAROL …it’s… it’s like a chant. 

00:30:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:15
KAROL So, I’m like well, you’re giving the advice in different words, but it’s the same thing that I do with my grandma. 

00:30:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:25
KAROL So I… I’m dancing with the two worlds. I kind of try to find the matches and there is one of them. 

00:30:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! Yeah, and it sounds like umm… you have the ability to recognize if… if you were going to enter more of this, umm… this problematic space where you know you do know that you are… perhaps your wine drinking is… is getting to be too much. And so I think that that’s the strength you have and… and maybe to umm… to… to really listen to that… that instinct that you have when, umm… when it feels like, okay maybe there is a problem and… and it sounds like you did that because you came here umm… to… to therapy, to… to talk about this a little bit more. 

00:31:05
KAROL That’s what I didn’t have two years ago. Two years ago… 

00:31:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:10
KAROL …when this first happened, it kind of felt like all of the sudden there I was in a big mess. 

00:31:15
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:31:15
KAROL Umm… So even though it was a big mess and it was ugly and it was hurtful, I’m kind of, part of me is kind of glad, like okay now I know what it looks like and it feels like. 

00:31:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:25
KAROL So, now I can be ready and make sure it doesn’t happen again. So I guess that… It was that fear like, oh I’m feeling a little… 

00:31:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:35
KAROL …racy! I’m feeling a little like, I need wine or I need this or that to help me calm down so let me do something about it… 

00:31:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:31:40
KAROL …before I crash completely. 

00:31:40
KEVIN NADAL Right! And so you know we are coming towards the end of our session but I think umm… what I do want to do is to… to for us to continue to see each other, you know once a week umm… for us to be able to… to talk about umm… when you do feel that you are going to enter this… this place again that you are scared off. Umm… And… And what we can do is we can… we can monitor a lot of these different things, having this once a week space for you to talk about how you are feeling and talk about some of these issues we can monitor, if things are getting worse. And if they are getting worse then may be we need to take some steps. 

00:32:15
KAROL Okay. 

00:32:15
KEVIN NADAL Umm… But what I hope is that umm… in talking about this once a week we can manage them and may be things can even get a little bit better. Because it sounds like there is an opportunity for you to really tackle to a lot of folks. I mean, that sounds… that sounds like so overwhelming to have school and your son and your daytime job and your nighttime job. You know, I don’t even know where you find the time to even to be in. So I… I think that you should recognize that, you know that… that is a strength that you have being able to manage all these things and may be now we could umm… help you to manage a lot of your emotions and… and to really you know express those a little bit more. 

00:32:55
KAROL Yeah! I definitely feel better and surprised. I think a lot of the things that I said I didn’t realize I felt like I had never voice them. 

00:33:05
KEVIN NADAL Great! So I’m glad it was a positive experience and I hope that may be once a week we can continue with this? 

00:33:10
KAROL Yeah, I think so. 

00:33:10
KEVIN NADAL Great! Thanks Karol. Very nice to meet you. 

00:33:10
KAROL Good to meet you. Thank you. 

00:33:15
De-Briefing of Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Karol 

00:33:20
KEVIN NADAL So Karol I… I wanted to thank you again for… for being a part of this training video. And I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what this experience was like for you. And may be some positive aspects with this experience and may be even some… some aspects that you think could be improved for our next time. So, feel free to share any… anything that you’d like. 

00:33:40
KAROL Well, it definitely felt very real. 

00:33:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:33:40
KAROL I mean, there are points where I… I was, you know, right back there where I was thinking, God, you know, you are right, I shouldn’t be part of all that I did, you know. 

00:33:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:50
KAROL And it felt good to hear someone else say it. 

00:33:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:55
KAROL Umm… Or when you said, you know that must have been really hard. I kind of just right back there like, yeah, it was really hard. 

00:34:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:34:05
KAROL Umm… So, it was definitely nice to… to just hear that. 

00:34:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:05
KAROL Umm… 

00:34:10
KEVIN NADAL So it sounds like feeling validated. Someone actually validating your experience helps you to be able to connect to it and… and to feel good about it. 

00:34:15
KAROL Yeah. 

00:34:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:34:20
KAROL Sometimes you discuss it with your friends or… or someone they’re like umm… you know, yeah, screw that, like. 

00:34:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:34:25
KAROL Forget him, don’t talk to them that you know, instead of just saying, yeah, you know that must be hard, because I’m going to continue to do it. I don’t need you to tell me not to do it. 

00:34:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:35
KAROL Just… Just acknowledging it… 

00:34:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:34:40
KAROL …for me because sometimes I don’t do it myself so it felt nice. 

00:34:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:34:45
KAROL And then being able to talk to you about things umm… like my grandma, Rosario, mandarino, like the baths, like, things that, you know, I could see in your eyes that I didn’t have to explain you know… 

00:34:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:00
KAROL …500-year history for you to understand what I meant. 

00:35:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah. 

00:35:00
KAROL Umm… You know, you knew right away like, oh yeah, Rosario, you might be, yeah. 

00:35:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:35:05
KAROL You knew what I meant. 

00:35:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:35:05
KAROL And then threw a word back at me, you know, when I’m talking about my family… 

00:35:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:10
KAROL …right away you said marianismo. And I’m like alright. 

00:35:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:35:15
KAROL It’s totally what it was. 

00:35:15
KEVIN NADAL Always I like to have a counselor actually know that term and, you know some of those basic concepts and may be your family or your culture. 

00:35:25
KAROL I never had a counselor or a doctor. 

00:35:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:25
KAROL There was a nurse. There was one nurse that was Latino. 

00:35:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:30
KAROL But I never had… During that period I never had a counselor or doctor that umm… 

00:35:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:35
KAROL Looked me or looked like you or that knew the language. So, it was just it… I don’t know what it was like, because it never happened before. 

00:35:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:35:40
KAROL You know, so it was just umm… comfortable. I didn’t feel… In other counseling sessions, I felt like I had to defend my stance… 

00:35:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:35:55
KAROL …that okay well, I’m not completely accepting that I’m bipolar… 

00:36:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:36:00
KAROL …and there may be other ways to deal with it. 

00:36:00
KEVIN NADAL Right, right! 

00:36:00
KAROL And I was kind of always on the defensive, like I’m here for you to help me, but… 

00:36:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:36:05
KAROL …I’m leaving the minute you… you try to veer off this other way. 

00:36:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:36:10
KAROL And I didn’t feel that with you. I felt like, you know he is gonna accept and… and understand what I’m trying to say. 

00:36:20
KEVIN NADAL That’s great! Yeah and I’m glad that you're able to share so much. And it sounds like you were able to open up. And that you even connected to a couple of emotions… 

00:36:25
KAROL Umm… 

00:36:30
KEVIN NADAL …throughout the… the session. And what was it like to… to experience some of those emotions? You know you said you are pissed off at some point and then you said guilty and feeling sorry for yourself, what was that like for you? 

00:36:40
KAROL It’s just kind of, you know usually kind of just doing. 

00:36:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:36:45
KAROL And then hearing you say what, say the words back at me and I think, did I say I pissed off, yeah I did say I was pissed off and I am pissed off. So it’s kind of like this surprise… 

00:36:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:36:55
KAROL …that I, you know I hadn’t realized… 

00:36:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:36:55
KAROL …for a long… I didn’t… I didn’t really grasp or… or allow myself to be angry. 

00:37:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:37:05
KAROL So having someone just notice it and acknowledge it and accept it, I’m like, you know it feels good to be able to say yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn’t mean I wanna do anything about it. 

00:37:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:37:15
KAROL But yeah, I am and it’s okay that I am. 

00:37:20
KEVIN NADAL So thank you again so much for… for being part of our training video and I’m glad that it was helpful for you. 

00:37:25
KAROL Thank you, thank you very much. And I hope that it’s helpful for you. 

00:37:30
KEVIN NADAL Thanks. 

00:37:30
Introduction to Counseling Session 2 Dr Kevin Nadal 

00:37:35
KEVIN NADAL Hi, welcome back. We’re gonna be watching a second video with Karol. But this time it’s going to be the follow-up session. We got a lot of information in this first session, a lot about her presenting problem, her family history as well as some of the cultural factors that might be affecting everything that she is going through. In the second session maybe we can build on some of those things that we’ve learned and may be try a few different counseling approaches to try to better deal with her problem. And so I hope that you can watch this video and pay attention to some of the things that again you might have done differently or some of the skills that you actually might use in your own practice. So please enjoy the video. 

00:38:10
Counseling Session 2 Dr Kevin Nadal and Karol 

00:38:15
KEVIN NADAL So Karol, thank you for coming back today. How is it everything going since the last time we spoke? 

00:38:20
KAROL It is much better. 

00:38:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:38:20
KAROL You know, nothing has changed just I have to do all my homework and balance work and being a mommy. But just talking about it and… and kind of hearing myself say what I’m doing. You know I… I decided, okay this is what I’m doing let me make some changes. 

00:38:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:38:45
KAROL So, I put kind of an alarm at night, so that I wouldn’t stay up so late and busy myself with things. Sometimes my son is the alarm. He gets up in middle of the night but not usually. So it’s a little better. It’s… It’s… You know, I’m kind of doing things to make it better. 

00:39:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:39:05
KAROL I’m still… You know it’s still scary. 

00:39:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:10
KAROL It’s still, okay, you know… 

00:39:10
KEVIN NADAL Great! 

00:39:10
KAROL …finals were coming up. 

00:39:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:39:15
KAROL You know, so I’m already kind of getting little nervous about how I’m going to handle that. But I think being able to talk about it and… and have you to… 

00:39:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:25
KAROL …balance things off makes it easier.(ph) 

00:39:25
KEVIN NADAL Great! It sounds like you don’t have this many people to talk you to about some of these things? 

00:39:30
KAROL Yeah! Well, like I said being the oldest in my family and first one in college and you know my father wants me to cook and clean and take care of my son. 

00:39:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:40
KAROL You know, doing all these other things are… 

00:39:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:39:45
KAROL …just not what I’m supposed to do. And my mom would wanna completely take care of me and take on half of my responsibilities. So I can’t go to them. 

00:39:50
KEVIN NADAL Right! And in the last week or two weeks ago now that we had spoken, we talked a lot about gender roles in your family and… and some of the cultural influences of these gender roles. Have you done any thinking about that? 

00:40:05
KAROL Well, I think about it all the time, but it’s pointless. 

00:40:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:10
KAROL It’s… You know my… It’s not going to change. 

00:40:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:40:10
KAROL And sometimes I still fight my dad on it, but, you know my mom is always going to serve him hand and foot. And my dad always gonna think that that’s what women are supposed to do and, you know so I can keep fighting him on it and try to educate him a little bit on it, but he is not going to change. 

00:40:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:40:30
KAROL So it’s kind of sometimes I have the patience to just say, okay dad whatever. And other times I still get pissed off about it though. 

00:40:35
KEVIN NADAL Sure! How does it feel talking about it right now? 

00:40:40
KAROL Umm… Better. Last time I was lot more angry about it… 

00:40:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:40:45
KAROL …just because you know it’s… it… it was so, almost like a realization even though I’ve lived with it all my life, but it’s… And I go yeah, that’s what he does. 

00:40:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:40:55
KAROL The kind of just getting it out there and hearing the name for it, even though you know it… 

00:41:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah! 

00:41:00
KAROL …it’s just kind of like, right maranismo and, that you’re like, that's just kind of how he is. 

00:41:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:41:05
KAROL And I don’t like it. You know I don’t expect to marry a man like that or raise my son that way. 

00:41:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:41:10
KAROL But I can’t change him. 

00:41:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure! And… And I think you're doing a good job in terms of recognizing you know how the family is, knowing that you can’t change other people, but learning how to adjust and… and how to you know recognizing you feelings and may be managing those feelings when… when you feel them. 

00:41:30
KAROL Yeah, sometimes I can do it. Like I said sometimes I still get angry and… 

00:41:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:41:35
KAROL You know, my dad and I get into it but for the most part I’ve been… I’ve been more calm I think in the past like two weeks. 

00:41:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. So, you know you told me just right now that you're setting this alarm to try to go to sleep earlier. 

00:41:55
KAROL Uh…Huh… 

00:41:55
KEVIN NADAL Tell me about just what’s it like to have to set this… this alarm and the whole discipline part of it? How is that process for you? 

00:42:05
KAROL Well, like I was telling you the last time it was really scary feeling like I was out of control and having you know racing thoughts and that fear kind of brings me to a good place. I don’t wanna go back there. So, if I have to set an alarm to keep my routine then I’ll set an alarm. If have to stay away from certain people or places or things and I’ll do that. 

00:42:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:42:35
KAROL Because college is that important to me and my son is that important to me and my health is that important to me. I don’t always fight with… I don’t always follow that. I study it and you know… 

00:42:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:42:45
KAROL In the two weeks probably it was once that actually I went to bed and the alarm went off. 

00:42:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:42:50
KAROL But I’m not going to sleep at two in the morning anymore. 

00:42:50
KEVIN NADAL Great! Uh…Huh… Yeah. 

00:42:55
KAROL It’s kind of like a snooze button things, so it goes off and I’m like, alright want me to do two more things and I’m in bed by midnight and set up at 2am. 

00:43:00
KEVIN NADAL You know this just gets me to think about that now you have this motivation to wanna change and may be before you might not have recognized that you're… that you were feeling out of control and may be now you're… you're trying to take control back of your life. And I think that you know having this discipline is something that is… is a really powerful thing. And I think that you know it’s really good that you're… you're setting these limits for yourself. I… I know that last time you spoke about drinking glasses of wine and one turned to two and two turned to three. 

00:43:30
KAROL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:30
KEVIN NADAL Can you tell me little bit more about that? 

00:43:35
KAROL Well that’s part of what I get afraid off. 

00:43:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:40
KAROL You know, I don’t… I know enough to know that it’s what I’m using to calm down. It’s what I’m, using to go to sleep. And I don’t wanna get to a point where I’m depending on it. 

00:43:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:50
KAROL So, the alarm helps me to say, okay, well you need to start unwinding. 

00:43:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:44:00
KAROL You know with… without the wine… I’m still drinking it. 

00:44:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:44:00
KAROL But if I stay up till 2am, half a bottle of wine is gone. Now, if the alarm goes off, I finish my homework, maybe I’ll have one glass of wine and go to bed. You know, so may be I won’t have any at all and go to bed. Whereas before there was no… I was just kind of doing it. I wasn’t thinking about it. 

00:44:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:20
KAROL I would think about it the next day and be annoyed that I was you know tired or you know… I could feel it the next day that it’s like probably drink like one to many glasses of wine or I just feeling guilty the next day. 

00:44:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:35
KAROL If I you know walked by the kitchen or I’m packing my son’s lunch and some two bottles of wine there, like it’s not what I want to do. 

00:44:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:40
KAROL It’s not how I want to be. But I was just doing it. And after taking to you it’s kind of like okay you need to be aware of what you're doing. 

00:44:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:44:50
KAROL So now I’m little more aware of it. 

00:44:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:44:55
KAROL You know, I’m still doing it sometimes, but not… not like I was before. 

00:45:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I’m wondering if you can take me through the process of what would typically happen when it’s you know late at night and you feel like grabbing a glass of wine? What goes on in your head? What makes you want to… to go towards the wine bottle? 

00:45:15
KAROL Well it’s been you know the day starts at 6am. 

00:45:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:20
KAROL And it does not stop. I mean I literally even through lunch, I’m working on something. My son is two years old, so it’s a big process. 

00:45:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:30
KAROL Everything is a big process, scarce it in, scarce it out, paying cab, walking here, the bus stop I mean there is a lot going on all day. 

00:45:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:40
KAROL So and even once after dinner is done, my son’s in bed, and my homework is done. It’s kind of like I have been wruum… all that. 

00:45:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:45:50
KAROL And I just wanna like hit on the brakes and just stop, dead stop. 

00:45:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:50
KAROL And I feel like I can’t do that by myself. A glass of wine helps me I just it’s like an emergency brake. I can just completely stop. 

00:46:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure! 

00:46:00
KAROL If I don’t have the glass of wine then everything that needs to be done is done, but now maybe I’m gonna read that book that I’ve been wanting to read. 

00:46:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:46:10
KAROL Or you know clean the stokes, I mean bigazete(ph) or you know I get stupid ideas, do stupid things like once I had cleaned the… the grout in the… in the bathtub. It was dirty so I cleaned it at like 11 o’clock at night with a toothbrush, it’s ridiculous, when you have to be up at 6am. 

00:46:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:46:30
KAROL So when things like that happen I know that wine like will dead stop me. I’ll sit, I’ll drink my wine. 

00:46:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:46:40
KAROL And go to bed. 

00:46:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:46:40
KAROL But like I said when I do that, it eventually moves up to two, three or more glasses. 

00:46:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:46:45
KAROL So I have to find something that will help me stop. 

00:46:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:46:50
KAROL You know so I’m not doing a million other things so I’m resting, but not depending on wine to get me to do that. 

00:46:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure, great! 

00:46:55
KAROL And the alarm clock helps a little bit just kind of like okay it’s time to stop. 

00:47:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:05
KAROL But I’m trying. I need something else. 

00:47:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Well, tell me about when do you start thinking about this glass of wine? Is that something like you're thinking about the entire day or it’s just something… 

00:47:15
KAROL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:15
KEVIN NADAL …towards the end of the day? 

00:47:15
KAROL Some time to think, not anything during the day. 

00:47:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:20
KAROL After my son is, like once he is down and asleep then it’s kind of okay and it’s me time so I start thinking about it. I can’t gonna you know watch sex in city and drink a glass of wine, but I have to homework. 

00:47:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:35
KAROL So I do that first. 

00:47:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:47:40
KAROL And then depending on what the house looks like. I may have to put laundry away or do dishes or… 

00:47:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:47:45
KAROL …you know do… do something. 

00:47:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:47:45
KAROL So I start thinking about it toward the end of night, usually, probably like anywhere from an hour to two hours before I actually sit down and have a glass of wine. 

00:48:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. You know and I like the visual that you said a little bit earlier about this emergency break and all of sudden just stopping. And then I was just thinking about you know as you mentioned when we start thinking about and not thinking about the wine throughout the day. You're thinking about it as soon as you put your son to bed. 

00:48:10
KAROL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:10
KEVIN NADAL And so it almost seems as if your son is like when… when you're with your son and you're doing all these other errands and your job in school and all those other things it’s like your light switch is on. 

00:48:20
KAROL Oh yeah, very much! 

00:48:25
KEVIN NADAL And as soon as you put your light, your… your son to bed, your… your light turns off and then that’s when you have your lone time. 

00:48:30
KAROL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:30
KEVIN NADAL So you know what’s that like to know that there is… there is clearly an off where you finally have time to yourself and to know that time is… is very limited? 

00:48:40
KAROL Umm… I never… never really thought about it, I mean I know that that’s… that’s my time. 

00:48:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:50
KAROL And it is very limited. I should be asleep. 

00:48:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:55
KAROL It’s like okay well now I can do my mails if I want to. Now I can have my glass of wine if I want to. Now I can read you know a novel that has nothing to do with class if I want to. Umm… But often times I don’t do those things. I guess I’ll just have a glass of wine… 

00:49:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:49:10
KAROL …instead, because it’s… it’s almost like a guilty thing like I should be going to sleep, so I can do all these things over again tomorrow. 

00:49:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:49:25
KAROL Umm… You know kind of like I… I don’t need to be focusing on my suffering now. I gotto focus on school work and my son. So maybe that’s part of it to with the wine like it’s kind of you don’t deserve like full you time. 

00:49:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:49:40
KAROL You just have a glass of wine, you go to sleep. 

00:49:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. And so you know it’s something just think about is that as you talk about these things it seems that even your alone time is spent thinking about the other people in your life and all your responsibilities. And… And so even though you have this time by yourself, you're working on that and then if you… if you don’t think about them it's almost like you feel guilty about it. 

00:50:05
KAROL Yeah! I don’t think I ever heard it said that way or even thought of it that way in my head, but there is a guilty part of it. You know like well you have so much to do, if you have time to yourself. 

00:50:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:50:20
KAROL Then it’s being else spent then… then you shouldn’t be here you know. There is so much and you play you shouldn’t have time for yourself and I don’t why I think that but… 

00:50:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:50:30
KAROL I guess… I guess I do think it and I hadn’t realized that that’s what I was thinking. 

00:50:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! Is that something that you would say as common in your family, just this idea of time by yourself is ill spent? 

00:50:40
KAROL For my… There is no alone time for my mom. 

00:50:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:50:40
KAROL She you know a good mother, lives for her children and serves her husband. My mother is like that, grandmother is like that, my thiyas are not like that, my… my aunts, but they are like (inaudible ). They are… They are, I think spinsters or old maids or something that in English. 

00:51:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:51:05
KAROL So, because they were kind of wild and (inaudible ) and had time to themselves. They were not married and you know they don’t devote themselves to their children, so they are not good mothers. 

00:51:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:51:15
KAROL The way my mother is, yeah, my mother in our family she is the good mother and a good wife. And my mother doesn’t get heard on. My mother doesn’t get nails on. My mother doesn’t go to book clubs or go to place. It’s you know what do kids want? What does my husband want? 

00:51:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:51:30
KAROL I know that my mother likes to read and I buy her books. But the only time she reads is when they are taking long trips. 

00:51:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:51:40
KAROL She will read in the car with my dad while he drives. But she’d never sit and read. No there is million and other things and you need to do for a million other people. 

00:51:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:51:50
KAROL So I guess yeah that’s… that's definitely a pattern in my family. 

00:51:55
KEVIN NADAL I notice your energy shift… shifted as you talked about your mom and some of these expectations and roles that your mom has. How does it feel taking about that? 

00:52:10
KAROL It… It’s annoying that I don’t know. I don’t wanna judge her because she says and she if you knew her you would see that she is happy living for her children and living for her husband. But I’m not, I don’t like it and I… I think she can’t be happy like that all the time. 

00:52:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:52:30
KAROL So you know my father says that. You're… You're never going to be happy with a man. You're never going to be married because you focus on yourself and you're… you're so Americanized. You know you need to serve your man and you need to do all these things that my mother does. And I’m not saying I wouldn’t do them or that you know, of course I gonna take care of my son and of course I wanna devote myself to my husband, but not… not the way that she does so extreme. So… So no me, you know there is no time for me it’s all for everybody else. 

00:53:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:53:05
KAROL Umm… 

00:53:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, it gets me to think about last… last time that we talked about marianismo and… and you spoke about how you never thought about it in these terms. You know it sounds like what you're describing about your mom is pretty much very standard term marianismo. 

00:53:25
KAROL Uh…Huh… 

00:53:25
KEVIN NADAL And you know I… I wonder you know how it feels to make that connection? 

00:53:30
KAROL Well it’s, just I’m laughing, you know and I’m… Even though I’m so against it or I’m doing the same thing that’s what I’m doing to myself at the end of night I’m feeling guilty because I have a lone time. 

00:53:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:53:45
KAROL That’s stupidest thing in the world. 

00:53:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:53:45
KAROL You know and… and it’s just you know here I’m thinking that I’m being so different than my mom and I’m not. 

00:53:55
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:53:55
KAROL In my head I’m not. 

00:53:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:53:55
KAROL You know I may be going to school and working and doing all these things that she doesn’t do. But at the end of day, I feel guilty about thinking about myself which is totally what my mother would, you know would feel. 

00:54:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:54:05
KAROL So umm… it’s kind of a weird… 

00:54:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:54:10
KAROL …thing to hear myself saying. 

00:54:15
KEVIN NADAL And it’s interesting, because you… you labeled this feeling as it’s a stupid thing to feel and… and I wonder if that’s your head fighting against like what you’re feel actually feeling. 

00:54:20
KAROL Yeah. 

00:54:20
KEVIN NADAL You know umm… 

00:54:25
KAROL That happens a lot when my head and my heart are… are fighting with each other. 

00:54:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah! Well tell me a little bit why you think that’s a stupid feeling to have? 

00:54:35
KAROL Umm… Because you know I know I shouldn’t judge myself, judging my mom, fighting against what… what is and that it’s always been and what everyone else is expecting of me. You know that’s like what you shouldn’t, shouldn’t do. But the reality is that there are expectations I need to meet you know in the world and with my family. And there are patterns that… that I either want to follow or maybe I don’t consciously follow but they are still there. It’s what I do, it’s what I know. So, sometimes I feel it’s stupid to fight it either way. 

00:55:10
KEVIN NADAL Right! And that’s… you know one of things about culture and what we recognize culture is that you know it’s not going to change but again how do we manage our role and then how do we manage our emotions when we have reactions to it. I mean it sounds like you're trying to do that you know. Let’s say like talking about this with me right now. 

00:55:30
KAROL Yeah, it feels very like up there I didn’t you know I hadn’t thought of my concern with doing too much or drinking too much… 

00:55:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:40
KAROL …or… or fighting with my dad or fighting with my mom or against what my mom does as being this big cultural thing and kind of seeing it that way, like ah… okay yeah. You know and I… I wonder if you know do other women feel like that, but there’s not. No there is not of lot of other women that are my age in college working with a kid. 

00:56:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:10
KAROL Umm… So I guess it helps me a little bit to feel like you know other people do this all the time and other people are fighting with this. But I don’t see it you know where I go it’s not there is not a lot of Latinos, you know I go to, mostly like college. Now it’s a lot of 18-year-old kids and you know they are not thinking about this stuff. You know I’m assuming I’m… I’m sure they have their own problems but… 

00:56:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:56:35
KAROL You know it doesn’t feel like… 

00:56:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:56:40
KAROL …like they would necessarily understand what… what I might think. 

00:56:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! And it feels isolating though? 

00:56:45
KAROL A little bit, you know a kind of and this is just me being may be jealous or hateful, but you know I wanna worry about you know where, whether I have the… how does new jeans outer or the cutest new shoes and that’s totally that I'm worried about. 

00:57:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:05
KAROL You know… You know I wanna worry about whether… You know, I don’t care obviously I won’t… I get really good grades, but I’m not going to cry if I get an A minus or a B plus. 

00:57:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:15
KAROL You know. 

00:57:15
KEVIN NADAL Because you have other things worry about? 

00:57:15
KAROL That’s not… Lot many other things to worry about. 

00:57:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:57:20
KAROL So you know it… it… I try not to think this way but sometimes I feel like ah… 

00:57:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:57:30
KAROL You know… stop wining about… 

00:57:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:30
KAROL You know that… you know, oh well, I don’t have a brand new car. Well, I take the bus to go to school. You know like, shut up. So sometimes it gets a little annoying when I looked at the whole picture. 

00:57:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:57:45
KAROL But for the most part I try to you know bring myself out of that bubble like. 

00:57:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:57:50
KAROL You know. That’s them, this is you. 

00:57:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah! I notice that you know right now, it… it seems like you're coming to a lot of different realizations and that sort of thing. But a lot of them are these, you know cognitive thoughts and that’s what I think. I’m wondering if we can connect to the actual feelings you know for making these… these thoughts. 

00:58:10
KAROL That’s what I sort of just think about it. 

00:58:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah! 

00:58:15
KAROL The feelings. 

00:58:15
KEVIN NADAL But… But how does it feel? 

00:58:20
KAROL Umm… Well like you know I can’t go there. My mom is a cry baby. I’m a cry baby. I can’t… I mean, I can but if I start feeling then I’m going to be feeling sorry for myself and I won’t be able to move forward and do what I need to do. Umm… You know we’re drama queens. You know, if I start feeling too much, I’ll stop that’s… that’s the other part of the wine like I can drink my glass of wine and it puts you to sleep. I mean puts me to sleep like right away and it shuts off, like you don’t even, like I wake up, it’s kind of like you fall asleep you don’t even know you fall asleep and you're done. If I allow kind of feelings to creep in, then those feelings, there is anxiety… 

00:59:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:59:10
KAROL …there is fear, there is a lot of self-talk and insecurity and anger and sadness and that’s not you know I feel like that’s gotto be put away in a little box because it’s gonna keep me from doing what I need to do. 

00:59:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! And it sounds like if you actually take the time to sit and… and feel the feelings on that it actually may come in the way of your functioning and so may be it’s even this kind of protective thing. 

00:59:35
KAROL Umm… Well, that… that’s exactly what happened. You know when I did end up in the hospital that’s that, I feel like that’s part of what happened. All those feelings got in way. 

00:59:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:45
KAROL And you know it starts with feeling sorry for yourself for angry or sad, if I know what I’m depressed. If I know what I’m doing on a bed. If I know you're in the hospital because you're like you know not sleeping, not eating and crying all the time. 

00:59:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:55
KAROL So I guess I’m kind of in a place where I don’t… I don’t wanna feel. 

01:00:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:00:00
KAROL And the wine helps to not feel to, which I didn’t realize so I started but. 

01:00:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah! So how does it feel when you realized, when you said that? 

01:00:15
KAROL Scarier even. 

01:00:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:00:15
KAROL Like now I know I can’t you know. 

01:00:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:00:20
KAROL Yeah, now I know that I have to… But I also know that you know you bottle stuff up it’s gonna explode. 

01:00:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:00:25
KAROL That’s what makes it scarier and looks kind of like well, if I allow myself to feel and go through this, I might have a period of you know where I’m kind of stop feeling sorry for myself. 

01:00:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:00:35
KAROL I don’t feel it then I’ll eventually explode. 

01:00:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:00:40
KAROL So I’m kind of screwed either way. 

01:00:45
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:00:45
KAROL Like with the gender roles you kind of can’t go either way. They’re always… There is always this middle place and I kind of have to dancing. 

01:00:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… So it sounds like you are recognizing these two things on one end that you realize that if you start to feel the feelings that it would lead or snowball into your depression and then you get admit to the hospital and that those scary places. And but on the other hand you realize that keeping things bottled up inside isn’t necessarily a good thing. 

01:01:15
KAROL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:01:15
KEVIN NADAL And I wonder if… if there is anything besides those two options that you have? 

01:01:20
KAROL Well that’s part of why I… you know I came to counseling as I know that there has to be something else that I can do. 

01:01:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:01:30
KAROL I guess I can a lot of what we talk about is so kind of like you said… you used the word cognitive. This is not a conversation I would have with my mom. And if I even started the conversation, she would just hug me and cry with me and say you know well I'll cook for you and I’ll take care of your son’s even go to school, and you know that’s not what I want either. So I… I… I know sometimes like if I, you know I have lot of time to ever really do this, but sometimes I write stuff down whether it’s poems or just how I feel. And you know two weeks later I’m cleaning up my room and I find it and I read it. 

01:02:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:02:10
KAROL It kind of helps to see, oh that’s how I was feeling. 

01:02:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:02:15
KAROL You know but I don’t do that enough. 

01:02:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:02:20
KAROL It’s like there is no time. It’s again that… that you know that guilty me time, you know poetry. I love writing poetry and you know I’ve… I've read it in you know in college and little open mikes and things, but that’s extra. 

01:02:35
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:02:35
KAROL You know, that’s like going to the gym, that’s writing poetry… that’s all those extra little things that you know single working mom going to college just shouldn’t have time to do. 

01:02:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… I wonder if I, you know you said that you… you set the alarm clock as a way to remind you to… to go to sleep soon. 

01:02:55
KAROL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:02:55
KEVIN NADAL But then at the same time it’s more like a snooze, because I mean you still continue to stay up for a little bit. 

01:03:00
KAROL Yeah! It’s working in the way. 

01:03:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! But now let you tell me about this… this tool that you have that you’ve enjoyed, which is you know writing poetry and… and you know writing how you’re feeling and that sort of thing. I’m wonder if that could also be another you know button on the alarm clock that will go off so that you could remind yourself to… to go back to sleep and… 

01:03:20
KAROL I’ve had times where I do that before bed or you know I’ll leave before bed and sometimes that helps me sleep sometimes it keeps me up all night depending on how good the book is. And there is other times were I’ll write before bed and then I can just, it’s kind of in the journal and then I can go to bed. And it’s… it’s like when the pages say put away out of my mind. I don’t it enough, but it’s definitely something I could do more like if the alarm went off, I could you know stop and write some stuff down. 

01:03:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:03:55
KAROL And hopefully get to bed afterwards. I’m gonna try that. 

01:04:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:04:00
KAROL Because it is something I just do randomly, kind of when the… when I’m inspired to. 

01:04:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:04:05
KAROL But I could do it, at night before bed and I can try to… 

01:04:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:04:10
KAROL …to see if it helps. 

01:04:10
KEVIN NADAL One thing that you know I’m… I’m thinking about is this as I mentioned these two options, it’s either of those, let all your feeling out and go to the hospital or… or keep everything bottled up inside. And I think that you're taking these steps, these alternative steps. Coming to counseling would be one of those alternative steps. I mean, again it’s a very positive thing that that you’re coming here to the sessions and… and able to talk about some of these things instead of letting it all build up. Because perhaps with these two options what happens is that everything builds up and you can’t take it anymore, so then that’s why it’s too much and then it snowballs until piece versus if… if you let a little bit out at a time and… and deal with some of these things that might helpful thing for you to do? 

01:04:55
KAROL That’s what happened before it’s that it kind of, it all went you know. I’ve done the other two before and hasn’t been good so, even though counseling wasn’t something that I really you know I did wanna do before. It’s not something that my family really… 

01:05:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:05:15
KAROL You know that’s… that wouldn’t be their solution. I know it’s… You know it… it’s helping. It’s… It’s just kind of talking about it, helps enough where if I can get out it here, you know I may not remember what we said in three days, but I don’t know. It just helps to know that I’m at least working on it. And it’s less scary if I doing something to prevent it or to stop it or like balance it. 

01:05:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Well we have a few minutes left and… and I know that this is your second session with me and I’m wondering if you could just tell me you know what this experience has been like for you. One thing that’s really important for me as a therapist is to make sure that there is good match between the clients and me. And the client has any questions or… or has can let me know what their experience is like. So that we can see if this is a good match for us to continue, so you just tell me a little bit about what this is like for you right now. 

01:06:20
KAROL I wouldn't have assumed that I’d be so comfortable taking to a man. 

01:06:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:06:20
KAROL Like my doctor is a woman, my boss is a woman, I… I don’t generally whether consciously or unconsciously like work with men. I feel like they’re always bossy, and they tell me what to do and where to go. And this was much more comfortable than I would have expected… 

01:06:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:06:40
KAROL …to have this conversation with a man. 

01:06:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:06:40
KAROL Umm… And I didn’t you know coming in, I was expecting to talk more about drinking, about wine you know. 

01:06:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:07:00
KAROL So I thought I’d come in and say, look I’m drinking three glasses of wine a week. And I thought you would say, alright, well how can we cut down to two? And then how can we cut down to one or else three a problem, like may be there is nothing wrong with you to drink three glasses of wine. So that was what I was expecting. And you know outcomes my dad and my culture and my aunts and my mom. And… And that was you know there was a lot of realizations of… of why do the things that I do and how I can change the things that I want to change. So that was surprising. And it’s kind of like ah… like it helps me breath easier, even though you never told me to stop drinking the three glasses of wine a week. 

01:07:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:07:45
KAROL Or I do whatever it is. So it wasn’t what I expected at all, but it was helpful. 

01:07:55
KEVIN NADAL And… And as you were taking you mentioned a lot of things that may be we could work on as you continue to come to these sessions one that me being a man and sounds like you have a lot of these feelings about how men might be in your life that might be something that we could explore here and may be this might be a safe space, because you can kind of feel some of those or… or talk about some of those feelings that you have with men, but actually say those things to man and try to explore some of those feelings a little bit more. And then just you know the other piece of… of coming in here and… and wanting to talk about these things and… and understanding that it’s not just about the wine. It’s not just about the staying up, it’s… it’s all of those factors that contribute to that… to those things and… and how you feel about all those things. So this is something that… that I think we can work on together in the next few weeks. How does that sound to you? 

01:08:50
KAROL That sounds good too. I mean, that sounds good. 

01:08:50
KEVIN NADAL Okay, thanks a lot Karol. 

01:08:55
KAROL Thanks.

De-Briefing of Counseling Session 2 Dr Kevin Nadal and Kirkland 

01:09:00
KEVIN NADAL So, Karol… This is your second time that you’ve met with me and I want to know if you could tell the audience a little bit about how this felt talking with me the second time around? 

01:09:10
KAROL It felt really natural. 

01:09:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:09:15
KAROL Surprisingly, it was… it was very natural. It was comfortable. I really did feel you know kind of the aha moments. 

01:09:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:09:20
KAROL And I did feel the relief. It… It felt a lot more… Relief is really good. Like… Like it really felt a lot more cleansing and… and alleviating than I thought it would, considering you know this is something… 

01:09:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:09:40
KAROL …we’re not efficient you are not… 

01:09:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:09:40
KAROL Really it might come when you’re not gonna stick around, but it was… It did feel really good, really very genuine. 

01:09:45
KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah! And one thing that I wanted to… to ask you about is I actually asked you about our relationship towards the end of the counseling session. Why was it to like to have a… a therapist actually ask about your relationship? 

01:10:00
KAROL Umm… It… It felt grounding, you know kind of to turn it. You know as I taking to you I… in my head I'm you know I’m there at night with myself. 

01:10:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:10:10
KAROL Kind of observing myself, right, so this is what I feel and this is what I think and I’m drinking wine and I’m worrying about these things. You asking about how I felt about you just kind of brought me back to right here. 

01:10:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:10:25
KAROL It’s like, right okay, well this is how I feel and this is what they like and… 

01:10:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

01:10:30
KAROL Umm… It just kind of helped me get out of my memories or my feelings and just come back to… 

01:10:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:10:40
KAROL …this is where we are now. 

01:10:40
KEVIN NADAL Right! The hearing now this is what we like to call it… 

01:10:40
KAROL Yeah. 

01:10:40
KEVIN NADAL …in psychology. Umm… And you know, was there anything specific that you appreciated that… that may be I did in the session? 

01:10:55
KAROL I… I don’t know how else to them, but like realizations and hot moments. It’s… You helped me kind of… I don’t how do you this but I, like I said coming from, okay the problem is I’m drinking three glasses of wine to go to bed and suddenly you pull out the parallel with my mom was like shocking to me, like wait a minute, here I am complaining that she doesn’t make time for herself and she devotes herself to her children and her husband and I’m doing the exact same thing, except it’s to my child and my career… 

01:11:20
KEVIN NADAL Right, right! 

01:11:25
KAROL …or my education at this point. And you know I complain about her not having me time and I feel guilty if I tried to get myself that time. 

01:11:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:35
KAROL And it’s is a parallel that I hadn’t, that I wouldn’t have looked that way before. 

01:11:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah! Well, I really enjoyed talking with you today, and thank you again. 

01:11:45
KAROL Umm… It’s my pleasure, thank you.
