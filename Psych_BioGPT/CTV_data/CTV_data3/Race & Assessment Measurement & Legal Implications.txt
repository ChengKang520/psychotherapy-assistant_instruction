Race and Assessment: Measurement and Legal Implications William E. Sedlacek, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
TERRY TRACY  Ah, devious distinction of, regarding the deanship is a better description. Uhm, I, ah, I first met Bill Sedlacek in 1977 and, ah, in many ways I'm very lucky I did. He, he, ah, changed my life in many ways, and I'm very grateful for that. He served as my mentor as a graduate student, uhm, and had a very large impact in terms of how I view the world, my professional identities or to things I value, sorts of things I like. Uhm, in many ways, I tried to model myself after him. However, I have hair. Ah, (laughs)(crosstalk) 

00:00:55
WILLIAM E. SEDLACEK  I knew that was coming. 

00:01:00
TERRY TRACY ah, and, ah, I, when I wear them I have better taste in ties. Uhm, I've always been impressed with Bill in his desire to understand, and that's the sort of thing that he has, he's been relentless in just wanting to know why in asking questions and setting up studies to figure out why things are the way they are, and I think that probably characterizes his work more than anything else. Uhm, and not always found fascinating, it was a wonderful model for me. Uhm, I don't come close to emulating it as much as Bill does. Uhm, in terms of his, the content of his re, his research, he has always been interested in and focused to why on various issues and aspects of discrimination in kind of all different realms. Uhm, it has been fascinating to kinda watch his questioning process, to kind of look at the stuff he looks at, look at the conclusions he reaches, and just a breadth of areas that he has kind of studied. It's impressive. Uhm, as graduate students, and this was, quite a, as a graduate student, this is for me obviously a long time ago, the joke among graduate students was you couldn't really kind of measure Sed's kind of academic contribution by counting his publications 'coz it was an awfully daunting task. The way we, and we teased him all the time but the way you measure Sed's vita is by poundage not by number of publications 'coz it must have weighed 30 pounds. Uhm, and if ever you, if you wanna see this, just go to his web page, and I guess it's not listed. He's got his vita on it, and it's actually an abbreviated version. Print it. It'll take half an hour. Ah, uhm, one of the areas that he has done, ah, a massive amount of work with huge impact is in the area of non-cognitive predictors of minorities, student success in higher education. He's done, ah, a lot of work in trying to help understand underrepresented groups in predominantly white campuses. Uhm, he has developed a model for the sort, the variables that are most salient in terms of looking at, and developed measures, uhm, to look at these and validated them in a wide variety of contexts. Uhm, his variables are being used in almost all medical school admission. It, probably it's close to, uhm, triple-figure college admissions. Uhm, they're being used in law school admissions. They now form the basis of the determination of who gets Gates Awards. Uhm, so his impact has been widely felt. Uhm, and his work has had, has influenced many people, and I hope that you will join me in welcoming Bill to, ah, to give us a talk. 

00:04:20
WILLIAM E. SEDLACEK  Ah, thank you, I think, ah, Terry. By the way, ah, you can have the tie after I'm finish with it. Ah, Terry and I actually share a tie and, and trade it off, ah, as we need it. Uhm, but, ah, I think Terry covered, ah, a lot of the things I would, ah, have said to introduce myself a bit. One of the aspects of what I try to do is to make the basis of what I do very practical, ah, ultimately, so that people can use the work that I do to do better assessments, to make decisions regarding students, to provide better services, better teaching, ah, admissions, financially things of that sort. Ah, and, ah, I will get to the specific, uhm, model in a bit, but I do also wanna acknowledge, ah, Terry, ah, for when he was a student and sometime afterwards did a lot of the important studies supporting many of the remarks that I'll make here. And so I do want to, ah, thank him for that because he's always made me, ah, look good as I go around and can say, "Yeah, Tracy(ph) was a guy that I had something to do with." Ah, additionally, ah, somebody more recently who, ah, ah, I think is it Arizona State here and he's on your West campus, ah, Millie Garcia. I don't know how many of you might know her but we've done a few, ah, publications and diversity, and diversity evaluation recently with a group of other, ah, authors, and just to acknowledge some folks that, that are here. Well, ah, in taking a look at this topic, the title and some of the things that Terry said, why do we need to do anything any differently? We often hear criticisms of this or that, ah, and, ah, for a long time, for many decades, people have been criticizing our conventional test and measures, and what I tried to do starting over 30 years ago is to really say, "Well, what are the alternatives," instead of just complaining and saying, " Gee, this stuff isn't fair." Ah, what about some alternative measures? I had this sort of training, ah, in the technical area. I really had to teach myself all the multicultural, ah, racial kinds of, ah, dimensions, which at the time I started this really did not exist in any of our curricula. When I went to school, there was no such thing as, ah, a course in racism or multicultural anything. Ah, those were just issues that hadn't come up, ah, at the time. So through the, ah, work with students, we're teaching through research. That's how I really got the basis of a lot of these things that, uhm, ah, I'll be talking about. Now, one of the, ah, people that's influenced me after I kinda got started in trying to say, "Can we develop some alternative measures that are more fair, less biased, ah, predict, ah, various criteria better was, ah, Robert Sternberg at Yale. Some of you are maybe familiar with his work. He's a psychologist and he works in the area of intelligence. And, ah, he has a three-part model that I think helps ex-, explain kinda the introduction to why my stuff might work. Sometimes audiences are, ah, say, "Well, you know, how do you know that this stuff really makes sense in some sort of logical framework?" So I'd like to start with, ah, his, his work to begin with, and if this works, it did, there we see the name Sternberg. Ah, but he has three kinds of intelligence that he talks about. I don't usually call my attributes, ah, intelligence. I, I call them abilities or dimensions or variables but, ah, I, I will give him, ah, his due in the, in a sense of talking about his types of intelligence. So for Sternberg, the first kind that he talks about is analytic, which he also calls componential, and it's essentially the kinds of things that are in virtually every standardized instrument that we used for assessment: predictory things like the SAT, GRE, MCAT, any of the traditional exams. We have a verbal and quantitative problem-solving, ah, dimension to them, and we know that some people, ah, get very good at scoring well in this particular test, and, ah, we have a big testing industry that makes a lot of money doing this, and, ah, even though we pretend like, ah, we have, ah, committees and are looking at exams differently as, ah, ETS or the College Board or some other groups starts a new exam. They're really all pretty much measure the same kinds of things if you ever correlate the, ah, the various types. The second kind of intelligence that Sternberg has is experiential. As the name suggest, you learn from your experience. Ah, you learn to be creative. You learn to look at things in sort of differential ways, different ways at different times. Be flexible. So, ah, pretty well, this kind of intelligence is associated with, ah, people in the arts, ah, people who do research, ah, good teachers, various kinds of things where you need to be able to look at things from different kinds of, ah, perspectives. Now, the third kind of, ah, intelligence I'm gonna illustrate with a, ah, a bit of a story in answer to a question I've been asked often here, and that question is, ah, "What's Terry Tracy(ph) really like?" So I'm gonna tell you a story about him when he was a graduate student. So this occurred, ah, when he was walking with a fellow grad student, alongside one of our many woods that we have out there in Maryland, and, ah, suddenly a bear jumped out and started to chase he and his fellow grad student. Well, ah, the other student was a, ah, high GRE-type scoring person. So he took out his slide rule, this is quite a while ago, remember? Ah, and figured out the speed of the bear and the angle of the bear and so forth and figured that in 1.2 minutes this bear would catch them and some bad things would happen. Now, Terry didn't do that. He had a backpack. He took it off and started to put on some running shoes while the other student ran up to him and said, "Look, Terry, we can't outrun this bear," and Terry said, "I'm not trying to outrun the bear, I'm trying to outrun you." And that was when I knew that someday he would be a dean somewhat. But this third kind of intelligence is contextual, systemic. It has to do with how well you can work the system in your behalf. If we wanna be positive, we talk about working the system. We talk about, ah, streetwise knowledge, that sort of thing. If we wanna be negative, we can say Machiavellian, manipulative, ah, those kinds of terms. But these are relatively independent kinds of abilities and just to oversimplified, what I think have been doing over these last 30-plus years, is developing measures in these latter two areas of intelligence. And what I'm contending here is that we spent almost all of our energy and time and resources in education on the first kind of ability, and very little to, ah, no measures available on the latter two types, and let's think of our typical student of color, our typical, ah, person from a so-called racial minority group here since that's the focus of the conference. Look at the kinds of abilities that people have talked about in the different presentations that you would need to make it, ah, in any area of society let alone education. You need a lot experiential, ah, ah, basis for what you do. You gotta learn from, ah, ah, your situation. You gotta be able to look at things differently. You gotta be able to work that system because it was not designed for you, ah, and unless you have the latter two kinds of intelligence, how much you have of the first type, how high your SAT scores are, how high your GPA is coming in, that's not gonna carry you because you have all these other things that will get in the way, and so oversimplified, that's why I think we don't have better correlations with some of our outcomes with the analytic-type intelligence. It's not that it is important for everybody but, it isn't relevant to you, excuse me, (coughs) unless you can get over, ah, these other kinds of abilities that are prerequisites. Uhm, so, ah, what I have is a system of so-called non-cognitive variables that, ah, Terry alluded to. Some people quibble with the term but it's operationally defined as, ah, a series of attributes that pick up on Sternberg's latter two kinds of, ah, intelligence, and I have many different operational ways to get at these. So I want you to think at these both as predictive-type variables as well as diagnostic ones. Because of my training, I try to select things that we could work with post-matriculation instead of just making a statistical prediction. For instance, I got colleagues who say, "Gee, you know, birth order is a great variable. Why don't you use that somehow?" And I could never figure out what the heck I would do with that. You know, get rid of somebody's sibling, ah, as a way to adjust that. You know, it's kind of a permanent sort of thing but these are all things that I think you can work with if you wish. So I try to set it up so that if you just wanna make statistical predictions, I can regularly beat things like SATs and GREs using these dimensions or if you'd like to then tied into some post-matriculation advising, counseling, ah, service programs of one kind. I know you can do that as well, and ah, at this point, I've got a number of different ways to measure this. Some of the conventional "paper and pencil on a line" type things, short-answered things, interviews, essays, portfolios, and I've done a number of studies to support these points. So the idea is that one way or the other, you can get at these things if you want to, and, ah, I have tried to make it, ah, easy for people to do that. All of my measures are available at no cost, for instance. So I tried to set it up, ah, to answer the question of why wouldn't you try this stuff anyway, because I've sort of done the work. And when we get to the applications part of it, shortly, you'll see how some people have picked up on it and used it in some interesting kinds of ways. Well, let me talk about these, ah, sort of one at a time, and, ah, I wanted to leave some time for questions here. Now, ah, Patricia, how long should we go? We started a little late, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
PATRICIA No later than ten. 

00:14:55
WILLIAM E. SEDLACEK Okay. So we wanna stay in time here and not cause you any more trouble. So self-concept, now, ah, we know about Janet Helms's work and we certainly got identity there. She's worked a lot on racial identity. I've done lots of things and other kinds of identify: religious identify, ah, feminist identify, all kinds of things tied up there. But the thing that's probably most unique about the way I see this, it's your identify as a person of color, let's say, coming to a more traditional major or traditional system. So, how would an African-American system feel about coming to Arizona State, for instance, that kind of question? Ah, it's a more complex question. It's one that requires some thinking, ah, as opposed to somebody like me who, ah, more or less, there are lots of people like me around all over, ah, and I expect to find them when I come to Arizona or anywhere else and, in fact, it turns out to be true. So I don't have to worry about how I fit, ah, in any of those kinds of areas. And, ah, one of the examples that run, causes some trouble these days, for instance, is, uhm, we have lots of, ah, programs and different institutions, and at Maryland, we have a lot of these, ah, sort of "sons and daughters of honors" programs is the way, the best way I can depict them. We wanna make every student feel like they're in some elitists sort of program, which is great. But, I've done a lot of work with these folks who contact me and say, "Gee, we're not getting the students of color in here. How come they are joining us in the same way?" And so I turn the question around and say, "What have you got to offer people like this? You know, how does this help their identification with the institution or whatever?" Think of what you're asking these folks to do. They're gonna go off in some sort of oddball major or little group of some kind. Maybe that's asking a lot more trust in the system than they might have. You're asking a lot more, ah, testing of their self-concept. They may have a tough enough time just trying to make it in the institution as a whole." So, ah, those kinds of self-concept things are useful in interpreting that. Realistic self-appraisal. Ah, we make it tough on people of color to figure out how they're doing. We give a lot of mixed messages. Just a recent study I've done, for instance, ah, we've had a large number of, ah, Asian and Asian-American students at Maryland growing. We're up to about 15 percent the undergraduate level now. So as all these folks come in, ah, they bring with them a lot of diversity among different groups as well. But one, one of the companion things we've had going on in our campus, a lot of people are worried about cults. So we've had an anti-cult program, and, ah, you know, some parents have said about cults and so on and so forth. So little data I gathered indicated that our Asian and Asian-American students aren't so worried about cults, and in fact, many of the things that the institutions calling cults are agree to their religious groups. So we're giving these mixed message of, " Hey, come on. You know, it's a great place. We've got diversity," but in the other hand, if you try to express your religion here, there's something wrong with you. So it's, ah, you know, a mixed message of some kind. So the people that can unravel it better and realize that what's the system and what's them and sort out how they're doing both academically and non- academically. That, that's the variable that's success for the student. Handling racism. I was glad to see that term come up a few times. Ah, I know we've had David Harris', ah, ah, display over there in the, ah, the board, ah, last few days, which is, have been good, and, ah, Professor Ramirez, ah, talked about it yesterday, but a lot of figure, people figure this is passé. You know, that, ah, "Okay, so I'm an old guy, been around since the '60s." That's, that's kind of, an, an old concept. Now, we're into diversity and isn't it wonderful that we're all different and so forth, which I agree is nice. But in the other hand, the underpinnings of a lot of those difference, ah, still bring out racism, which oversimplified, today I'm just talking about structural institutional things that get in the way of a lot of the, ah, kinds of people that, ah, we call, ah, so-called minority groups or people who earnest, were not as used to having around matriculating, uhm, less traditional experiences and so forth. So if we have the structural formal or informal things that get in the way of the best interest of those people despite their other characteristics, then we have some isms. Some quick examples, ah, and the key is how a student handles the racism 'coz I'm kind of assuming it's there. I'm gonna give you a few examples of both, some isms that I see, ah, to illustrate it and then some examples about how to handle it. One of the ones I engage in is that, ah, I think I can speak a little Spanish, you know? So, ah, it helps my ego to feel like I can come up to somebody named Lopez and starts speaking Spanish. But the problem is that I'm using my power as the both the professor, the white male, and so forth, to force that person to be Latino. Maybe they don't wanna be. We know from studies about, ah, handling racism, is one of the issues that a lot of Latino struggle with, is how Latino should I be. Should I join the Latino Engineering Group? Should I join the regular one? You know, should I tell my parents what I'm doing? How do I handle all that stuff? Maybe I can even speak Spanish. Maybe I don't wanna speak Spanish. So, it would much less racist of me to just come up to the person and begin some kinda dialogue in English, and then ask him if they wanna speak Spanish or they're willing to let me bumble along with my Spanish and, you know, whatever, rather than just forcing a person into a role. And so that fits with one of David Harris' examples of well-intentioned people doing things, and then somehow not understanding when the student may not respond. So the student has to decide, well, how am I gonna handle this guy? I don't wanna upset him, I'm trying to get a grade in the class, whatever. It puts them on the spot. Uhm, another example that came up with, ah, might appreciate this, some of your, ah, folks who are grad students, or obviously most, if not all of you have been the grad school, was working with one of our departments on their comps, ah, exams. What happened was, ah, this department had, ah, three students of color: One African American woman, ah, one Latino male, and one Asian international student. And they were the only three people that failed comps. So the students were upset, the department is upset, they couldn't figure out what the heck happened here because the students were doing well prior to that. And so, in analyzing it, there are a few kinda subtle things that came up. One was that the department had just tried some new exam system, some new kinds of ways of asking questions and we, we know from the literature that anytime you're in a time of change or transition, that's when your isms tend to come out more. People play it safer. They get more traditional. And that what happened in evaluating the student essays and things, too. And in turn, one of the ways that many people of color have learned to handle racism, one of the styles is to say, if something new confronts you, again, play a little safer, don't just plunge in. Plunging in and writing everything you can think of is much of a white, upper middle class sort of thing to do, figuring, oh, they know me, I trust them, they'll score my stuff well, so on and so forth. Another thing that had happened was, because of the interest of these students of color, they tended not to be, ah, working with the most powerful faculty in the department. The most powerful faculty can kinda demand that everyone works on their stuff, their topics. So these people had advisers, but not the main ones who were, ah, carrying the most weight in the department. And in fact, one of the things that actually happened about a week before the exam, one of the professors unintentionally, which is the way much racism happens, had handed out an article that would, turned out to be very relevant on the exam to his advisees because he thought it was interesting in one of the seminars, and so the folks who didn't, ah, get access to that information obviously, then couldn't write about it. So these persons, students did better. So, ah, you know, the fact that they were just horrified to think that they were doing something they might call racism, and it was sort of easier for me to go and talk to them about some of the things that they were doing, that weren't intentional, et cetera, et cetera, the students then, I could talk to and have them validated a bit, and have them sort out the difference between the exam system and their abilities. So what they did essentially was, ah, redo the exams, give them to the students again. They also gave the students more time to write, because again, one of the conservative things to do is to go slower. And so these students of color took more time to write out their answers than did the other students and the timing that was such that it didn't give them their full shot at the exam. So, ah, all kinds of isms come into our assessment systems, and this was one that was really quite, ah, ah, detrimental to the whole program. This department view themselves as very, ah, interested in diversity and very pro-student and so forth. But with the right look at the assessment, and looking at it in terms of handling racism, you could actually zero in on something, and it's, ah, for most academics, it's easier to talk about a variable than it is to say you're some kind of a bigot of some kind. That, that stuff doesn't work very well. So this is very a curvilinear variable. If a student is preoccupied with racism, and everything is racism, and you're constantly struggling and dealing with, it may be understandable, but it doesn't help you get through this system, you burn up. You leave, you don't succeed, you alienate people, and so forth, who are judging you. On the other hand, if you're naïve, and say, you know, what is that old stuff? Maybe my parents had to go through that, but nowadays, we don't have to face that kinda stuff. You're gonna have lots of things probably happen to you that maybe aren't easily explained using some other model. So the people that are kind of in the middle, sometimes I'll do something, sometimes I won't, but I have a kind of way to interpret some things that are occurring, some working of the system. And I think this is right out of Sternberg's third type of intelligence there that will be, ah, to my benefit and, uhm, I understand what's happening, and then, this, I think, is a truly sort of bicultural, multicultural thing. You've gotta work a system but at the same time, not give up your cultural background that helps you interpret some of the things that are happening. And that's, ah, I think, a good operational definition to that. So going on to some of these other ones, we've got long-range goals. This is an interesting one because, ah, so, so many of us have been around education so long that we just assume everyone knows about the third gratification. You know, trust me, someday, 20 years from now, this thing that's causing you all the trouble, your Stat class or whatever, as a grad student, you'll use it someday, trust me, you know? Again, trust. Ah, what we have because of the isms in the system, ah, and it happens with more than just racial groups, but that's what we're concentrating on today, you haven't developed that trust, you haven't seen a lot of people like you go through the system and say, "Oh, I can see that this person, you know, did this and did that, and it all sort of links up." Ah, that's where the role model stuff sort of comes in. And, ah, you have to have a lot of faith that this will happen, ah, and so forth anyway, so that, uhm, people who are able to articulate longer-term goals of any kind, even personal goals, do better, because their system is heavily dependent on that. And, ah, what you do as a person who is receiving some kind of isms, some kinda discrimination, if the system won't let you plan for, you know, eight years, or four years, or whatever, then you shorten up the planning time. And I think if you really check it out, you'll find that many of the students of color that you're working with, or that you're assessing him one way or another, have very short planning times because that's all they can see that would be useful. The shorter the planning time, the more, ah, negative outcomes you'll have in our system because we really require people to think ahead to be successful. Interestingly, here we have a little, ah, sexism laid on top of this, because it's mostly guys, like me, that are running this system. Now, we do have, ah, obviously, lots of females around, but sometimes they also operate in a system much like males would in the same role. So just because your gender is different doesn't mean your style is different. And, uhm, what you will find that, then is that, ah, people like me are wo, more worried about males and other groups, we're more threatened by that. We don't think women are that important, anyway, so we'll just sort of let them go a little more. So, to the extent that that happens, this is a better predictor of problems for males, particularly in your, uh, racial cultural groups that we're talking about here. And so something to take a, ah, take a good look at and check out. And I have all kinds of examples, if we have time, of people who've used this in different ways. Leadership, ah, probably the original student services variable, you know. I imagine, ah, Plato is looking for leaders to sit on a log with him at one time, but, ah, I'm sure your schools, like most that I visit, and that is that you have a Leadership Night in the spring, and you give all these awards out for leaders of this and that and the other thing. We even give an award out for, you know, the outstanding minority student. But as near as I can tell, that sort of the minority student that looks most like the majority students. Nothing wrong with that, but that's only one way to make it. And so, ah, the department I'm connected with started a, ah, an award for the student who's done the most work against racism in the last year. It's mixed in with all the, you know, outstanding junior biology major, and all that sort of stuff. And so the first year we gave it to somebody who, uh, in her brief acceptance speech said, "Last year, you were trying to have me arrested for this stuff. This year, I'm getting an award. I wish you'd make up your mind." (Laughs) So these are often just the people that are sort of a pain in the ass, you know? (Laughs) The people that are causing trouble and don't wanna go along with stuff and so you have to kinda dig these folks out. And in fact, there are lots and lots of different ways to show leadership, and many students of color will do it off-campus, do it in non-traditional ways, do it in things that look socially unacceptable. For instance just, ah, there are lots of interesting studies on street gang leaders who, when they come back to school, do very well, because they were successful in their previous culture, they translate that well to a new situation, they have that ability to work with a system. And so we wanna make sure that our leadership isn't just, you know, presidents of the student body and cheerleaders, and so forth, like that. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's just one kind of leadership. So dig a little deeper, and then take some thinking sometimes, you have to be looking for it or it may not, uh, come to you. Strong support person. And I already mentioned role model a little bit. Sometimes we get too hung up with that, but what we find is that people who are most successful have a history of turning to an individual somewhere in their life for assistance when they need it. We all know we need that some time. Our people of color are more likely to need it more often because they are working this non-traditional system. And if you have somebody who's a loner, and said I can make it on my own, and we know there are some cultural groups where that's an, ah, ah, an important, ah, attribute, is to sort of be independent, you know, the, the macho sort of idea. Ah, but that doesn't work well if you're trying to work a system. You've gotta have some individual you can turn to, and this is often one of the places where you can look for family members, ah, extended, ah, community folks, people in the churches, things of that sort, or white faculty members, ah, white teachers. So many times, ah, people ask me, "Well, gee, I don't know what to do with this stuff because I'm not a person of color, I don't understand it." But people like me understand the system, at least from our point of view. So you can be a tremendous help to a student who's trying to figure out what the heck is happening. And I have many, many relationships based on that where I come in and process things with the student and end up being a support person in that way because that's what they need, ah, and they may not get it, ah, from somewhere else. They may not get it from a person of color because we often marginalize those folks in our systems as well. So it's not just automatic that you send all of the, you know, African American students over to the African American Center and forget about them. Ah, that's probably not gonna work. Uhm, community. One of our overused cliché words these days, we're all in favor of community building, building communities, all that sort of thing. What we find here is that, ah, people of color need to have smaller communities other than the total, and they're often based on race, culture, gender, various kinds of things like that, in order to process some of the stuff. Ah, Professor Ramirez(ph) talked about this, ah, yesterday, very well. Ah, I forget the term, what was the term, David, ah, that you've said yesterday about, or what do you call those things, ah, ah, where you got together with folks, ah, late at night, or whatever in, uhm, maybe somebody remembers that term but.

WILLIAM E. SEDLACEK  interactions, something. So the idea, a place you could go and say, let's figure out what the heck is going on here, let's hang out with some people like me. But at the same time, as he said yesterday, you can't spend all your time there. Big problem for international students, for instance. Language, food, and sort of hang out together because you're not gonna learn how to negotiate the system. You're not gonna learn how to deal with other kinds of people if you just stay within your community. But a good multicultural environment needs both; opportunities to do that, opportunities to understand this diversity movement that's taking place, and realize it's important to also have community building, ah, community opportunities within the various racial cultural communities that we have, and those are very compatible with one another. And in fact, there are separate variables, as you can see in my system. You need both, you can't do just one. The last of these non-traditional learning, as the name suggests, uhm, has to do with what do you learn from your experience, right out of the experiential learning? When we do the assessments, we find, even when we do very traditional exams, we find that, ah, people of color have often learned, ah, a great deal from their experiences outside the education system somewhere, in their communities, ah, through their families, ah, in all kinds of ways, and because of the racism that we've had, we have forced people of color outside the system more to sort of do your thing there, because when you're in the system you might not be able to use all your attributes as we've talked about. And this is one we regularly missed, because we could really use this information in education to hook up students with, ah, professors better to get them, ah, involved in research projects, to see what their career interests might be based on what they've done. And if we just cut this off, like most schools, we just assume unless you had, you know, History 101 at our place, then you didn't really learn it well, so you have to take all these courses, rather than assuming some knowledge. And the knowledge can be on all sorts of areas, it doesn't just have to be in a one, and, ah, really, in the sense, though, that grad student example I gave you illustrates, ah, that issue, because those people were learning in different ways about their profession, and bringing different things in, but they weren't being assessed properly on what those things were. So let me talk about some of the, ah, applications here that are kind of interesting just to give you an idea of some of the things that are up. Ah, Terry mentioned that a number of institutions used these measures, ah, use these dimensions in one way or another, either in general admissions 

00:35:50
Applications Admissions - Castaneda v. U Cal - Farmer v. Ramsay Financial Aid - Gates Millennium Scholars - Washington State Scholars Teaching 

00:35:50
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Special program admissions ah, a second level of admissions, like in many medical schools, what you do is you only bring certain people in for interviews. And you can use this for all students so that you don't have to be just a student of color to be evaluated, it just that it would be much more ah, have much more validity in making the predictions or ah, the absence of checking out these non-cognitive things will get you in more trouble making in predictions. But you can certainly use them ah, for everybody. So you can use them in a multi-tiered situation, too, where you maybe just have a supplementary application, or you only interview certain people, those kinds of things. So there are various ah, things that people have done. But the first case ah, I wanna talk about here, since I mentioned discussing the legal implications here, that's one thing that (coughs) often scares folks who say, "Gee, you know, we'd like to try this, but we're afraid somebody will sue us." And ah, you know, that's a legitimate concern for somebody running a, an institution of some kind. So I'm gonna mention these two cases, which ah, hopefully, will give you a little more ah, good feeling. This first ah, Castaneda versus ah, University of California Regions, this is the Berkeley case that some of you may be familiar with. But essentially, the major civil rights groups in the country, which include ah, ACLU, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the uhm, ah, the Asian Pacific Legal Center ah, so forth ah, a whole group of uhm, ah, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Funds. So they're the plaintiffs, and they're bringing suit because of this Proposition 209, which reduce the numbers of so-called minority students ah, greatly, at ah, at Berkeley. And ah, what they're saying in the case at this point, just to vastly oversimplify, it's been going on for years, and it's just about due to take ah, another big turn, as the plaintiffs there are saying, "Look, if you use this system that Sedlacek is talking about here, and an instrument that ah, you know, we can develop that fits right into what you're doing, then we will call off the lawsuit, because what will happen is you will get more students of color in without directly focusing on race by looking at different kinds of attributes. So if you check out places where people are likely to show their abilities, you'll pick up more people of color because that's where they're showing what they can do. And so ah, despite the president of the university, President Atkinson saying, "Well, we're not gonna use the SATs anymore." Might be okay, but the classic dilemma when people do that is they still look at that analytic intelligence but in a different way. I'm sure if I could bring a bunch of applications in for any kind of educational program here, and we could all look at them and we'd, there'd be some correlation with, with SAT or GRE scores, if ah, if that was our goal. So you really have to go after different variants. You can't look at the usual stuff in a less efficient way, and then pretend you're doing something. So ah, Atkinson's view was to use the ah, achievement exams from the SAT, which are likely, there's very little information on it, but there are likely much more of a problem because you're (inaudible ) the thing of all the students who don't get the chance to take the advanced placement courses and all those kinds of things ah, and they would have, I think, much, many more problems with that. So, essentially, here is a, you know, kinda the liberal side saying, "We think this stuff looks pretty good, why don't you use it," and uhm, so institutionally, and you have ah, those kinds of organizations saying we think this looks good. The Farmer versus Ramsay study is ah, one that's taken place at, in, at the University of Maryland Medical School. And this is in the Baltimore Circuit Court, where our medical school there uses these non-cognitive variables in an interview situation for ah, candidates to medical school. A white male candidate said, "Hey, my MCAT scores were higher than some of these students of color you invite in ah, you know, I'm suing you." And what the ah, where the case stands right now is the judge has issued a directed verdict saying, "It's okay for the ah, medical school to go ahead and use those dimensions because they have some support and that ah, he doesn't have a case." So in this case, it's the State of Maryland, the Attorney General's office sort of the other side of the coin, you know the int, the foundation of society, the institutions of society saying, "We think that this stuff looks good too." And essentially I tried for a long time to get the university to say yes, you know, this stuff looks important and there are a few other cases that have been involved there but in both cases you've got ah, people giving support for the idea that one can use these things so uhm, I don't know how they'll both turn out but hopefully you will have more use of these dimensions in any case. Uhm, now one of the more interesting applications that's come up lately interlude to briefly is the Gates Millennium Scholars. Now just in case some of you don't know ah, what that is, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle and that's, that's the Bill Gates that were talking about ah, Bill Gates happen to have a spare billion dollars, that's would it be and ah, he said why not give it to students of color. So students in the four major ah, racial groups, African American, Asian American, Latino and American Indian or Native American ah, received these this full rights scholarships for as long as they are in school in any institution they get accepted to. So you can go to community college or Harvard, get it all covered for as long as you matriculate even if you go on to graduate school. So this is a 20-year program, it's ah, starting its third year now ah, will be this next year we're on the second year right now and ah, so far there have been 5,000 students of color who've been given scholarships attending 938 different institutions and the primary way they're selected is with these nine cognitive dimensions because the logic of the program, what they did was, was this and I like to use this as an example for students who say, "You know, you're doing all these research, what good does it ever do?" You know, I wanna see some change, I wanna have client or a, a student right in front of me that I can teach something or see what happens." And so what they did in the first year, two years ago of the Gates Program they developed the application form quickly before they decided how they were gonna evaluate it and then they looked around and said, "Gosh, you know we're gonna have all these thousands of applications, we better figure out what to do." And they didn't wanna just get the usual suspects, they didn't wanna just high, get high grade getting, high test scoring ah, folks because they were already getting money and that's one of the other isms in the system when we're talking about these minority scholarships and things they go to people like that primarily, who probably don't really need it as much or they have more traditional experiences but in any rate, so they looked around. Some people had heard of this so my system was really, fit their needs very well and at first they weren't sure that you can dig this out of an application form that wasn't designed for it but in fact we could. We demonstrated reliability, we get a nice normal distribution and ah, among other things we have a, a 22 year longitudinal study that's underway and we will eventually ah, we had 5,000 the first two years including some grad students and currently matriculating students but we'll have a thousand new students each year for the next 18 years. So now just thinking of what we've got here, you know, we have no data like that at all, think of what a great data set this is ah, for those of you who know about The Shape of the River that book about the Harvard and Princeton ah, students of color who went out. We know that that's a pretty select group so we're gonna have, you know, rivers and creeks and tributaries and ah, all kinds of stuff to figure out here. So we'll have thousands and thousands of students and we'll have a control sample, these are all PEL eligible students who get this money, so they're all broke, they need money and so we'll have all kinds of studies and ah, one of the things I'm gonna look at that I keep reminding my colleagues on is, "That the risk of always sounding like the guy who's talking about problems all the time is ah, maybe a lot of money isn't good sometimes." Take one hypothesized thing, some student comes to Arizona State an Arizona student of color they developed their support system, they get things going but then they'd figure, "Hey, I could go to Harvard." And they end up going there generally places like Harvard don't have good support systems, they don't ah, treat ah, people of color well in my opinion, they don't have good student services, so on and so forth. So maybe that isn't a good place for you to go, so you struggle, you don't do well or as you might have done a lot better in some other kind of setting. So I'm gonna be looking at transfer students, I'm gonna be looking at the evils of money ah, things of that sort because there's a tendency in the scholarship area that say, "If we just had money we wouldn't have any problems." And ah, in fact that might work against something like setting long-term goals because you'll figure, "Hey, I can just matriculate here forever because Bill Gates has deep pockets." Ah, now I hope that doesn't come out that way for everybody but I think you have to at least look and not just say, "Isn't it wonderful that we're all in this program and have all this money and everyone likes it and no one wants to say any negative thing." So that's I think one of the values that ah, you can use in research. Uhm, and I do wanna be the oldest person ever to publish a research article, so I hope I'm around in 22 years ah, and can still write this stuff but you will undoubtedly see lots of these data coming out in different forms. Though, the state of Washington has a similar program that's not based on ah, race at all but it's for needy students and they also use the dimensions in a somewhat different way. By the way in the Gates ah, second year application if you look at it, and we'll be in the third year one too, if any of you look at it you can see short-answered questions based directly on these dimensions that I've talked about and so what I do is train people of color around the country to judge these applications and we demonstrate reliability and we hope we're gonna get the validity now and looking to see what happens to these folks. But how do one, how do ah, judge these dimensions and then give scores based on a system that we have off of these applications. So now it's easier because there are more questions that are directly on these dimensions. Ah, so if you have any, I'm sure you have some Gates Millennium scholars here at your institution and ah, if you're trying to encourage more you can say, "Hey, you know I know how they're looking at this stuff." So ah, give them some good advice hopefully we won't ruin the validity but uhm, I would rather take the chance in trying to change what we do rather than to say, "Don't tell anybody about it because I wanna have good ah, you know, regression coefficients at some point." Uhm, so the Washington State scholar's another good example and ah, in a sense they were really a good example because they hadn't been doing any evaluation at all in this program and ah, some of the people in the program are saying, "Well why would we evaluate it, you know? People get the money, they're happy. We give the money out, we're happy ah, you know why do you wanna, what are you talking about evaluation here?" So ah, you have to bring in the idea that's it good to know whether you're really affecting something. And ah, without dwelling on it uhm, we could certainly use this in teaching, advising things like that. I use this all the time in trying to interpret my work with ah, students and all sorts of different ways as an individual. So if the student's presenting something, some issues, something from class ah, in an advising session whatever then I will use these dimensions to try to figure out well what's going on here. Uh, and so at the same time you can try the system to change it, try to change the system, you can also use it at the individual level. So I would sort of talk about it in terms of how the student handles the system but as I suggested, many of the things you can do and including this very presentation today, I hope you will think about this stuff, use it and then maybe some of the work that you do, whatever you do, will be better, will be less racist based on the definitions I used and so that's my way of trying to also change the system by making it, you know, pretty easy to say, "Well why not give this a shot?" So oversimplified go back to your departments and say, "Why don't we each kind of pick a variable or pick a, a task that we have that we think might work in one of these dimensions" and then try it next semester or next year whatever then comeback and report on it. Maybe some of them will work maybe some of them won't, maybe we'll have to revise some of the ah, ideas that we had here so it's ah, something that I am giving you as a ah, an idea to add to whatever else you're doing not to ah, say you know, "Stop what you're doing and use my stuff and don't pay any attention to ah, anything else." So I'm not suggesting that we throw out the test or any of the other things we used. I'm suggesting that we add to what we've got and use all the information ah, we can and if we make these wider range assessments I think everyone ah, will gain. This is also I think a key to helping people understand that old questions, when somebody says, "Well I understand what you mean by racism." or, "What do you mean you have to be, you know, if you're a person of color you have different stuff come up you know, I don't get that?" So this is a way to communicate about those kind of things and be quite specific about it in lots of circumstances instead of just ah, being frustrated or saying, "Trust me it's a problem." So, ah, that's my basic ah, pitch here. What I'd like to do is throw it open to any questions, comments that ah, you may have including any disagreements, I think Terry Tracy said he was going to throw in something to disagree with me because that's ah, his personality style but ah, ah, any thoughts that anyone has about the, yeah? 

00:50:45
WOMAN I uhm, I was sitting here listening to you talk about handling racism... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh-hmm. 

00:50:50
WOMAN ...and you talked about uhm, in ways making concessions, my making concessions as a person of color... (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh-hmm. 

00:50:55
WOMAN  and to try to fit in to a system and that's what I've been doing all of my life. So what's... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Right. 

00:51:00
WOMAN  different about your approach? 

00:51:05
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Well, maybe nothing if ah, if you know that and are doing it ah, some people don't ah, understand what racism is or don't see it and ah, I certainly run into lots of students of color that ah, aren't really aware of, of that or, or think that racism is something that ah, you know, we'd moved passed but the idea that if you want a, if you want to succeed in a traditional system you have to understand it enough to know what it wants of you and work it. Some people might ah, be willing to make concessions in some areas, some people in other areas, some people don't want to bother with it at all and might drop out of school or go to a different kind of institution or whatever. So in that sense, as long as you have the idea that there are things you need to do to understand about any system and that a lot of them may be based on your race and culture and your prior experiences that would be ah, you know you would score high on this dimension but they are variables and not everyone ah, scores high on them, as I mentioned in the ah, in the Gates application. The first year we had 16,000 people scored on these dimensions and they are only ah, something like ah, 16 people that got a perfect score, I know. So most people got distributed somewhere between low and high and middle and ah, ultimately you'd like to reduce the variances so these variables didn't work. So that everyone understood that and could say it as, as well as you did and we wouldn't have that as a predictor anymore but then our society would be different. Yeah? 

00:52:40
WOMAN I'm ah, as a kind of a follow-up. Why should I be the one who will always make... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh-hmm. 

00:52:50
WOMAN ...concessions and be responsible for other people's attitudes on racism... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh-hmm. 

00:52:50
WOMAN ...and, and, and biases? (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Yeah. 

00:52:55
WOMAN I mean, I think that traditionally what people of color have to do is continually over and over and over adapt and adjust and acculturate and assimilate and, and not be accepted for who they are and, and the system work for them not there trying to limit or fit into that system. So I hope, what I'm saying is that you understand is that I get really frustrated when I have to always say, "I need to learn how to handle someone else's racism." 

00:53:30
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Sure. 

00:53:30
WOMAN It's not, I'm not the racist, (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh-hmm. 

00:53:30
WOMAN the other person is. So why should I be penalized or limit it in what I am trying to do? 

00:53:35
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Right. Well I agree with you and hopefully the more people that understand that, the more people like me that understand that, the more people that ah, can change and say, "Oh, I have something I can do, the more places that use this system to evaluate their people whether they really understand all the nuances of it or not, you're gonna have a less racist evaluation system and there will be more people like you that will get a chance to do their thing without having to raise those questions. So that's the hope that we have for the future. And so I, the way I view social change you need to do the two things at once. You have the classic dilemma of saying, some people saying, "Well when we get enough, you know, students of color here then we'll worry about it." And the other people are saying, you know, "Well we gotta change it first." But probably neither of those is very practical, you have to equip folks like you with a way to think about what you're doing and it can be very empowering because it's, you know, instead of feeling isolated and lonely it's got a name, it's got a label, you got a way to talk about somebody else and at the same time you're trying to change parts ah, of the system. Like I think I'd think I'd change that one ah, institution that ah, that one department that had the problems with the grad students. And ah, so the more people that sort of understand it, who can do it, who can, can communicate back and forth will less likely, 20 years from now when that Gates study is over, that somebody who's sitting in your spot will say those same things or say, " Didn't that used to be a problem back there you know, 20 years ago?" That's the kind of thing that we hope ah, we hope will happen but for the moment we do have those isms out there and ah, the people that handle them end up succeeding better. Yes. 

00:55:20
MAN I work on a public school setting, (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
MAN public school setting and we struggle with uhm, decisions about placements into advance classes, honors classes, giving programs and so forth and I can see these non-cognitive variables that you've talked about working in a say an elementary school setting. (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
WILLIAM SEDLACEK  Yeah. 

00:55:40
MAN Does that work when applied at those ah, age levels? 

00:55:40
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Yeah, I have ah, as Terry mentioned I've done more work with higher ed. but there have been several people who applied ah, these dimensions to different ah, elementary and secondary situations. Sometimes using even criteria of ah, ah, problems that the students get into various truancy kinds of ah, criteria, things of that sort. But I think what's good about it is that ah, my evidence suggest that the earlier you introduce this to students in the pipeline the more you get them to realize that there is something about this system, that there is something systematic that they should start thinking about in relation to themselves. The more you can make these variables seem like appropriate, educational things to be thinking about. Sort of spinning off the last comment, instead of just saying, "Well that's stuff that I don't deal with, you know, that's for the counselors or that's for the people of color or whatever." Ah, to make it sort of everybody's business and make it easy to work with then I think you will find a better placement, you'll find ah, the students moving into their high school situations and moving from ah, high school to college easier because they'll be more prepared to deal with that environment. So instead of ah, like in the Gates thing, instead of just ah, saying, "Gee! I can get into Harvard so I'll go there." Maybe that's not a good place for you. So I think matching environments with ah, potentials here ah, that students have and their strengths and weaknesses was ah, is always a good idea and ah, I think you can do that in the elementary and secondary level or some people have done some work with community groups, things like that, after school programs, so I think that they do have ah, potential there and ah, even though I don't have my website listed on the ah, on my ah, sheet there ah, it's got a big long address but if any of you want to u-mai, e-mail me I'd ah, at the bottom of my e-mail address is the website. So ah, I don't know if I can try to move backwards in my ah, system here but my e-mail address is ws12@umail, that's U-M-A-I-L .umd.edu. And so ah, there are also lots of articles that you... (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
MAN (inaudible ) 

00:57:57
WILLIAM SEDLACEK ...can look at and download, yeah, one more time, ws12@umail, U-M-A-I-L .umd.edu. Yeah. 

00:58:10
MAN I've got a question. I think you mentioned earlier that you are not entirely comfortable with the, the label of non-cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh hmm. 

00:58:15
MAN  variables of racism and I agree I, I, I'm worried that uhm, a lot of the value of this approach might get uhm, ah, get distractive a bit... (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh hmm. 

00:58:30
MAN ...or, or diminished a bit like calling, well to put it on a blunt way that the criteria that the Whites do well on are cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Yeah. 

00:58:40
MAN ...variables? And the word cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
WILLIAM SEDLACEK  Sounds good. 

00:58:45
MAN ...sounds very positively. (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Sure. 

00:58:45
MAN And then there's this non-cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
MAN  which is negatively (inaudible ) kind of you know less than cognitive... (crosstalk) 

00:58:51
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Sure. 

00:58:51
MAN ...or, so at the very beginning it would be, I think it would be nice if some kind of other have a system of labeling... (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
MAN ...ah, for the all predicted variables... (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Sure. 

00:59:00
MAN ...and they all have different amounts of cognitive and, and social and affective... (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
MAN  components ah, involved. 

00:59:10
WILLIAM SEDLACEK Well, you might be right. Maybe that's why I am using Sternberg to sort of cover my ah, word there but this was a word that ah, had a little bit of ah, use in the literature when I started back... (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
MAN Oh, right, right. (inaudible ) 

00:59:21
WILLIAM SEDLACEK ...in the late 60s and some psychologists use it ah, quite specifically but ah, so that a lot of the ah, tradition of the research that I've done is using that term ah, and so part of it is to make this look ah, look positive and given operational definition to it so that ah, if people were to look up non-cognitive theory in any of our search ah, devices they would pop up with this stuff but you're exactly right and, ah, it does have a negative connotation I think for a lot of people. And hopefully ah, we can concentrate on the operational definitions because one of the things we've done historically in dealing with racial topics is to think of new euphemisms that didn't sound so bad, you know. Several of our speakers have dealt with those kinds of things where we, we went through various terms to describe folks, you know we used colored because it didn't sound as bad as some other things we use, you know, one through Negro and ah, so on and so forth, So that ah, I'm trying to focus on the operational principles and it is a problem to have a single word to describe all these stuff so that ah, ah, I'm actually gonna do a, a program with Sternberg here in a couple of weeks. And so maybe I'll ask him if I can just lift his ah, labels and stick it on my stuff and see what he thinks about that. But ah, I think that is a good point and some people do ah, react negatively to it.
