Managing Therapeutic Issues with African American Clients: Some Necessary First Steps A Lecture by Thomas A. Parham, Ph.D. Counseling Psychologist 

00:00:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Hello, I'm Doctor Thomas Parham. I'm a Counseling Psychologist and Director of the Counseling Center at the University of California, Irvine. In this tape, I'd like to continue to explore issues related to counseling African-American clients. Specifically, I like us to look at the therapeutic process itself and what kinds of things that we as counselors, clinicians and other allied mental health service providers might do to more effectively treat African-American clients. My own frustration with the state of the art in counseling relates to the idea that in the 1990's we have finally come to the realization that traditional psychological theories developed by European and American psychologists and counselors are not always applicable when we're treating culturally different people. But what do we do differently? A number of cultural groups and scholars have been very adamant about criticizing traditional psychologists for their theories, particularly when they apply them to culturally different people. But what do we replace them with? Do we entirely throw the theory away? Do we supplement the theory with additional explanatory constructs to ex, expand its comprehensiveness? I don't know. We're gonna try to explore some of those issues on today's tape. If you consider putting five clients in front of you, all of which are culturally different, and you, as a counselor think about applying your level of knowledge to work with those specific clients. You've got one client who is European-American, one client who is Asian-American, one client who is Chicano-Latino, one client who is American Indian, and finally a client who is African-American. My question is, how might your therapeutic approach and your counseling skills vary with each one of those particular clients? You see, I think that two of the most important questions for us as counselors and service providers are what and how. What do we want to do? How do we want to do it? I think we're very good at this point at being sensitive enough to know what it is we want to do. We want to be more culturally sensitive with clients. But, if you put a therapist in front of these five clients and say, how would you do it? How much are counseling skills differ with each one of those? I think most of us would be hard pressed to try to figure that out. And so what I'd like to do is explore with you today some ways in which we might work with the African-American client, ways to not only be sensitive to that person but how to specifically do that. Now, our discussion today should start off with a definition of what is, in fact, an Afrocentric psychology? What is an Afrocentrically-oriented counseling process? Uhm, African psychology, African-centered psychology examines processes, which allow for the illumination and the liberation of the spirit, one's spiritual essence. Relying on the principles of harmony within universe as a natural order of human existence, African psychology recognizes, first of all, the spiritness, which permeates everything that is. Its Wayne Noble who said, whatever is, is in the first place spirit. It recognizes the notion that everything in the universe is interconnected. That's the notion of consubstantiation. Elements of the universe are of one substance. Third, it recognizes the value that the collective is the most salient element of human existence. And finally, the idea that self-knowledge, know thyself, is the key to mental health for African-American people. And so Afrocentric psychology is a dynamic manifestation of the underlying African principles, values, traditions and customs, whereby the application of knowledge is used to resolve personal and social problems and promote optimal human functioning. That's the definition that we're gonna try to work with today. What is in fact that, that Afrocentric psychology in that specific definition? Well, we're gonna try to examine through my analysis some of the, the cultural dispositions of African people and show how they might relate to therapeutic focus. Since I understand at a cultural level that whatever is, is in the first place spirit, that there is a spiritness that permeates everything that is living, and also believe in the ontological principle of consubstantiation. It means elements of the universe are of one substance; that we are all interrelated. Then, somehow everything that lives on the universe, somehow has to be related. There are some common themes and characteristics. And so, if I think about developing common characteristics -

00:05:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM - of living things, - 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM - there are two to three that come to mind. You may be able to think of more. The first is, all living things that I observe have a tendency towards self-preservation. 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Isn't it interesting that our organisms, our physical organisms, ourselves, are designed to keep ourselves from perishing, to somehow preserve the self, that life is most important. Everything that lives has a tendency towards self-preservation. We function in a way that allows us to preserve and sustain and promote and enhance life. Okay? Another common characteristic of living things is most things when they are somehow in their, their embryonic stage and then end up to be full-grown have the capacity to grow. 

00:07:10
[sil.] 

00:07:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM  And so, I think that capacity to grow is an important element of things that are living as well. And third, is the capacity to regenerate. 

00:07:30
[sil.] 

00:07:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM  It doesn't matter whether it's human beings. It doesn't matter whether they are animals. It doesn't matter whether they are plants. All living things have the capacity to regenerate. Now, if in fact we believe in that ontological principle of consubstantiation and there is an interrelationship between elements of the universe - we're all of one substance, my question is, can we take these common characteristics of living things and use those and translate these into somehow a therapeutic focus. 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM  And so, if we look at, for example, the tendency towards self-preservation, what does that ring for us in terms of our understanding of, of therapy? I think it really begs us to question or examine, if you will, an understanding of functional behaviors. What does that mean? It means, - 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:08:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM - if in fact, human beings have the capacity for self-preservation, then most of our behavior is typically designed to preserve the organism in some way. And so, even though we may be looking at behavior in a client that we believe is totally non-functional from our particular perspective, what I want to invite us to do is to step back from that and say, hmm, is there something that is functional about that client's behavior that he or she believes is somehow meeting a need? The therapeutic focus related to self-preservation is the idea that we need to examine and understand functional behaviors and what need it meets for a client. Say it's more about that. How many of us have had a friend who's been involved, in say, a destructive relationship? And the friend is very good about calling us up and complaining about how they dislike this, they dislike the other, the person is real awful, terrible, horrible, miserable. Well, our advice to them typically is real simple. Leave him. But, no, next week, right back with the same person, calling us up on the phone. Some of us even get so frustrated in our attempts to help other people, that we tell them, look, we can be friends. We can talk about anything else but don't ever call me up and talk to me about this particular issue until you're ready to do something about it. Now, my question to you is, is your advice that says leave that individual relationship alone, bad? Is it inappropriate? I'm not sure. But, what I would argue is that, perhaps, the advice is maybe ill-timed or, perhaps, it doesn't recognize the functional behavior related to that particular, ah, ah, client issue. It means, if, in fact, the client is engaged in behavior of self-preservation, a more appropriate question should be not why didn't you leave that person, but what does that behavior get for you? And, how can I, as a therapist, help you to meet that need in a different way than the way you've been meeting it before? It means that we've got to get past the surface structure to the deep structure to understand not necessarily what the surface behavior is but what need does it meet for the client to be able to help that client grow and to change. Okay? Now, secondly, if another common characteristic is the capacity to grow, then part of our therapeutic focus has to examine what are the obstacles to grow? What is getting in the way of helping that client to grow in a way that he or she would like to grow? Part of our focus has to be to examine what in fact are those obstacles that keep that person from being all they can be from self-actualizing for merely allowing that spiritness in an African way to manifest itself, such that, that person is living in what we call an optimal fashion. Okay? And, third, as we look at the capacity to regenerate, the question is, can we teach a person to overcome these specific obstacles and do so in a culturally specific way? I think that in counseling African-American clients, there is always a connection with the universe and harmony, that somehow whatever is, is in the first place spirit and the ontological principle of consubstantiation, which says elements of the universe are of one substance, if we believe that interconnectedness, and somehow we can examine even these three characteristics or others that you may think of, can we then turn these common characteristics into a therapeutic focus? What I'd like to do in it is attempt to look at functional behaviors, obstacles to growth and how to overcome obstacles and, and maybe reframe as a way in which we should begin focusing on working with African-American clients. Now, I shared with you earlier in the tape my frustration that we're very good at answering the question of what. What do we need to do? That's to be more culturally sensitive with African-American clients. The question is, how do we do it? What I'd like to do is examine a way that we might be able to break the therapy focus down into very simple component parts. I think that as a counselor, be you a first year graduate student or a skilled clinician who's been out 30 years, the therapy process can be broken down into simple component parts. The first, what do we need to do with the client? We have to connect with the client. There's a necessity to establish a therapeutic relationship with him or her. Secondly, we have to be able to facilitate awareness. Once we have a relationship with that client and that client is connected with us, how then do we facilitate awareness such that they gain greater insight, the, in the illumination of the spirit as it will, to try to move towards what's going on with him. What are their obstacles to growth? What do I need to do to get a handle on what's going on in my life and be able to move towards ah, changing that? And the third phase would really be setting goals. How do I help that client set some goals for their continued growth and development? Now, in looking at that focus, what I'd like us to do is focus on the issue. This is what we wanna. What we wanna do, first of all, is connect with clients. Now, in connecting with clients, in this particular part, this I think is one of the most undervalued and under-utilized skills that we'd learn. I have an observation in fact, that the people who are best at connecting with clients are usually first year practicum students. The reason is that when you're first learning micro-counseling skills or basic counseling skills, it doesn't matter whether it's obvious model or ECON's(ph) model whoever it might be, what you learn basically is how to sit there and just connect with the client and build rapport and establish trust and do those kind of things that are necessary to establish a therapeutic relationship. And you work real hard at it primarily because that's the only thing that, that, that the first year practicum students know. The more we, ahh, ahh, grow as clinicians, the more experience we get in our ability to conceptualize and diagnose clients from different theoretical orientations, to use differential diagnosis to employ testing and assessment techniques, the less time we spend on connecting with clients. And so, we assume that connecting with the client is tantamount to coming into a therapy session saying, "Hi, I'm Doctor Parham. Welcome to the session. Sit down. How can I help you today?" And then somehow we've established that relationship and built that rapport. I would argue that, that is not what needs to happen. If you examine statistics about working with African-American clients and other cultural specific groups, you'll find out that most of them who come into counseling terminate therapy after the initial session, better than 50 percent of them terminate therapy after the first session. What are we doing in that initial session that says somehow to the client, it's not okay for you to come back? I believe it's related to us not doing our homework in terms of establishing that rapport, building that trust and making a connection with that client. So, if our question is what do we want to do? Connect with the client. What we want to do is see if we can focus on specific skills. How can we do that? I've got a couple of suggestions for you. The first is to use a ritual. I think that most times when you see African-Americans get together in any type of group, be it large or small, you will always find them using ritual in some way, shape or form. Now, ritual could take the form of a handshake. Ritual could take the form of pouring libations. Ritual could take the form of listening to or, or some music. There's something that allows them to connect up with that particular individual or body that they are now, you know, being a part of that allows them to kinda, you know, get together. And so, I think the use of ritual is really important. Now, being able to, to utilize ritual in a counseling situation is very, very tricky because it, it assumes that you, the counselor, have enough knowledge base to know what in fact are Afrocentric rituals. And so, I caution you against just going out and trying to pull a ritual off the shelf and say, let's insert it and assume that will work. If you're not real sure, then remember what Carl Rogers says, sometimes the best expert on the client is the client. So, if you don't have something that you would naturally do, then ask the client. I like to be able to connect up with you in a way that allows you to kinda take care of whatever therapeutic benefits we need to do today. Are there any rituals that you typically engage in before you do some work that you would like to bring into our therapy session today? Sometimes, you can just ask the client for what that's about. I think that is particularly important. An example of ritual, I run a group here at the university that is called "What's Going On?" It's a support group for African-American males. And one of the things that we do is we use ritual to start off the group. Now, what's interesting about this particular group is that if you read the literature, some of the literature I should say, people would argue that groups are not very effective with African-American people. I, on the other hand, would argue quite the contrary to that not only are they effective but oftentimes sought the treatment of choice where African-Americans are concerned. Now, in this particular group, we start off with eight or nine or 10 people, okay, which is a typical group for a size with one leader, sometimes two. Well, that group has now expanded to sometimes 19 and 20 people per session, per session, meeting on a weekly or sometimes in an every other week basis. Now, what is it about the group? Is it the content that we're discussing? I'm not sure. Is it the facilitator? I'd love to believe so but I doubt that as well. What really happens is that the clients in the group have made a connection to it and the connection to each other. And I think that one of the things that has facilitated that is our use of ritual. What we start the group off with is by holding hands and connecting up and asking people to close their eyes. And what we do is invite them to just connect up with each other via that ritual about just holding hands and connecting. African people are very, you know, feeling orientated and, and, and ah, being able to touch one another, I think, is really important. You'll, you'll just see them kinda hug or, or do something to connect up. We try to do that in the group. We also start off with a poem. And the poem, in fact, is borrowed from ah, Wayne Noble's book African psychology. It's called "Standing in the River." And it goes something like, truly in the flow of human development, the African community's river and we who call ourselves African-American males are standing deep in this water. And as the poem goes on, we try to get them into, ah, ah, the Afrocentric notion of reinforcing values of collective survival and universality and, and harmony and the need for balancing the life and those kind of things. And as we, in the poem, we then mix in some music and, in fact, the theme for the group What's Going On is, in fact Marvin Gaye's hit song from the 70's "What's Going On?" And so, people have been invited to open their eyes as the music comes on and they listen to Marvin Gaye talk about through the song "What's Going On", and invites them to just kind of meditate on that theme and then be prepared to kinda share with themselves what goes on in the group. It's that e, e, example as just one of many on the use of ritual in our group that I think has helped that group to be more ah, very successful and for the past two or three years that I've been running it has, ah, ah, been a very, very important part of the African-American experience here at the university. Ah, continuing with specific skills, I think being able to exhibit congruent realness is, as Carl Rogers has talked about, is another important element. What does that mean? What does it mean to exhibit congruent realness? That means there are some times for a therapist to be able to engage in self-disclosure. Sometimes, for a therapist to be able to just be who they really are as a person and share themselves with the client is really important. Oftentimes, we, as therapists expect the client to do all the talking and for us not to do any of that self-disclosing itself, I think it's really important for us to be able to do that. Now, exhibiting congruent realness might not be, for example, just mere self-disclosure. It might be the discussion of a popular issue that's going on. What do you think about x-issue or y-issue is going on? How is that impacting your life? What's going on? What it does, I think, is allow you to make a connection with the client by allowing the client to know that you have a frame of reference that may be similar to ah, her or his. Another thing that we might do in terms of, of just being with the client here is really the use of non-verbal affective responses. I think we teach that a lot in beginning counseling skills about how to use both verbal and non-verbal behaviors, but I think non-verbal affective responses that somehow really demonstrate that you are empathizing with the client is very good. Now, what's important to understand about those non-verbal affective responses is that they are very similar to the call-response format that is used in, in, in our communication styles with African-American people, so much like what you would find in the Gospel Church or in the Black Church where on Sunday the preacher sends out the message in the congregation then engages in kind of a call-response format. What you want to do is also begin to do that same kind of thing with the client so that you allow the client to really know that you are really with him, that you're hearing him and that you're understanding what it is that they're saying. I think also being able to, ah, to communicate with him but he is not just through non-verbal but also verbally, you know, repeating for the client what's going on. I think these are some examples of, of how you might connect with a client. Another way, ahh, as we focus on number four, is discussing, ahh, racial therapeutic match. That idea is related to the notion that oftentimes counselors are really reluctant to discuss race as a therapeutic issue, particularly their own, and oftentimes I find that African-American clients, particularly when they are, ah, in therapy or counseling with a non-African-American therapist or sometimes even with an African-American therapist, find it difficult to kinda work with that because there are some issues going on about, is this particular counselor like some other white people that I might have known where I might have had a negative experience, or someone from another cultural group. And so, somehow as counselors, our own anxiety and uncomfortableness with confronting race and our own, maybe, racism and biases and stereotypes and other kind of things prevent us from doing that. But I think that, if in fact, you find that counseling is somehow running into an obstacle and things aren't quite flowing right and you're clinical intuition is saying, this therapy session is not quite moving in the way it ought to go, one of things that you might explore as an issue is, perhaps, the racial-therapeutic match may be in question and that's something that you want to deal with with the client. By simply asking him, how is it that, ah, how are you feeling about us having this different therapeutic match in terms of race? That may be one of the ways to get at that. Okay, now, as we move along, again, the, the issue is what we wanna do, how do we wanna do it. The second thing I think that we need to do once we connect that with our clients is begin to then facilitate awareness. How do we then facilitate awareness that allows for the illumination of the spirit as we talked about before. And I think there are several things that we can, we can utilize. Number one is rephrasing. What is rephrasing? Now, in a cultural context, what we learned in the African tradition is the same. It says that life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites and fruitful harmony. Let me say that again. Life at its best is a creative synthesis of opposites and fruitful harmony. It means that sometimes your greatest strength can also be your greatest weakness depending on the particular context. And so sometimes what you can do to rephrase something for a client, okay, or, or, or, ah, reframe it is somehow help the client synthesize opposites. So if a client comes in and says, for example, ah, I've been involved in this relationship and it's just been, you know, bad and I'm really depressed and, you know, from the last 20 months it's been a little crazy, whatever. Well, one of the things I might explore is, how long have you been in the relationship? Well, I've been in the relationship four years. And the class talking about the last 20 months, what were the first, you know, 26 months like? Well, they were real good. They were, ah, ah, you know, very focused, whatever. What rephrasing does in this particular case is it allows a client to not just focus on the negative aspects of it. But for a client to be hurting that bad, to be depressed that much about a relationship also says, that at one point in time, he or she had to feel very good about the relationship as well. That simple rephrasing helps them to maintain a sense of balance and equity in terms of their view and perspective about that relationship rather than just accentuating the negative aspects of that particular relationship. I think also, in here, two and three, ah, ah, the reflecting, ah, you know, what the client has reflecting of feelings and also summary statements I think are also very good ah, at facilitating client awareness as well. Now these are discussed, ah, ah, ah, adequately, I think, in the typical counseling literature, so let's spend less time on those. I wanna move over to number four, which is the use of metaphor. I think the use of metaphor in, in counseling is, is really interesting and a very effective tool to facilitate awareness because oftentimes you will find African-American people who understand life and appreciate life via set of principles. And oftentimes the principles are revealed through, to them through the use of metaphor or through the symbolism contained in the metaphor. But I think somehow that our, our, our normal counseling practice doesn't teach us how to do that, and I think that that is one aspect that we might want to think about utilizing, in terms of, of facilitating awareness. Ah, the fifth one here is, is analyzing resistance. One of the other ways that we facilitate awareness is to analyze resistance. And this is really important because remember, in our, our, our opening segment of the tape, we talked about ah, one of the things that we wanna analyze are obstacles to growth. One of the things, I think, that analyzing resistance or, or defenses does, is it allows us to examine were the obstacles that keep you from growing in a way that you would like to grow and putting them, I think, in a, in a, in a culturally specific frame of reference I think makes a lot of sense. Now, facilitating awareness in this case is not just a, a, a vehicle for the counselor to work with the client. It's also important for the therapist to have his or her awareness facilitated as well. And so, there are couple of things that we wanna focus on here. Remember, we said that one of the common characteristics of living things is a tendency towards self-preservation, and if we believe that, then we have to understand the idea of functional behavior. We as therapist have to begin to understand and appreciate functional behaviors. That means, even though a client may, you know, may come in with, with behavior or thought process or feelings or something that somehow are totally foreign to us, before we discard those, before we begin to label those as somehow pathological and other kinds of things, what we wanna do is just resist that temptation for a moment, and try to examine what is it that that behavior gets for that particular client. Because I think inviting them to give that behavior up is gonna be very, very difficult if we somehow don't understand what need it meets, and that takes I think a deeper level of understanding that sometimes we're used to using in our, our counseling practice. Uhm, also, I think it's important ah, to understand the client's cultural values system ah, and be able to communicate that to the client. And so, engaging in some readings ah, ah, by some of the, the contemporary black psychologists and some of those ah, ah, articles in books, I think it will go a long way in trying to help you incorporate some of that client's values system and also allowing them to know that. Okay? We talked about values of the holistic self, the legitimacy of feelings. We talked about ah, the, ah, the language and communication and the idea that it is less formal and is very attached and and interconnected. We talked about living in harmony with the universe. We talked about survival being much more collective based on the Ashanti Proverb, "I am because, we are because, we are, therefore I am," is those kinds of values that we want to be able to uhm, ah, incorporate into ah, our session here. And then lastly here, the respecting part here deals with respecting the client's need for distance. Oftentimes I find that clients will come in and they'll say, "Well, I don't really have this problem but my friend X has the problem." And somehow we get taught in our therapeutic or, or, or, or counseling practice to immediately confront that and say, "Well, you know, ah, client X, aren't you really talking about you having that problem?" And somehow, we, we, we, have a fundamental disrespect for client distance without recognizing that that maybe a, a, a way for the client to present themself ah, and have them deal with that at that particular point in time. And so I think that that's another way that we might be able to facilitate awareness to them is by respecting distance and allowing us to really understand what is it that that distance gets for them in the moment, not only with a particular ah, issue that that's related to, but also in the context of a therapeutic focus with you as a therapist. Now, again, our critical issues are what do we wanna do, how do we wanna do it. What do we wanna do again after we connect with clients and we've then facilitate awareness is when I wanna begin to set some goals. How do we do that? How do we set some goals for the clients so as that they can begin to work on ah, whatever particular issues and problems that they have. Here are some things I think that you need to consider if you're gonna work effectively with African-American populations. The first is becoming a subjective companion. What does that mean? Much of psychology teaches us that the role of the therapist is to be an objective outsider, that somehow you should not allow your biases and stereotypes ah, and preconceived notions to, to ah, enter into the therapeutic process and then somehow the client ought to be allowed to grow in ways that are important to them. In the African-American tradition, what we understand is that, somehow, there are rules and order, ah, that somehow rules for living, there are somehow ways in which we are supposed to go about conducting our life that somehow should be incorporated into the process. And so what I'd like you to consider is the idea that rather than being an objective outsider, a psychologist may wanna consider being a subjective companion. For example, if I have a client who comes into a therapy session with me and now wants to consider, you know, a particular issue, and one of the things that they are focusing on is their own racial identity and within the racial identity, they have, even though they're African-American, a very pro-white, anti-black orientation, to not only to themselves but to other African people. Now, as an African-American psychologist, I understand that not only is there's a cultural violation or a distortion but that is not healthy behavior psychologically for that particular person. Well, my question is, if I'm gonna be an objective outsider, do I then engage in therapy process that focus on maybe a side issue for the client and allow them to emerge on that contact with me without somehow my communicating to them, my vision for what healthy, normal, optimal human functioning ought to be. That's the question. My answer to that would be, in that case, it may be a good idea for you to be a subjective companion rather than an objective outsider, ah, deliberately communicating to the client, your, your understanding about what optimal human functioning might be and how that person if they engage and that might be able to better work on whatever problem or issues that they brought with them into the counseling context. Ah, again, in terms of setting goals, we've talked about reframing. Ah, in reframing in terms of, of an environmental context, ah, I think is ah, a real important skill to teach for the client. Ah, you hear me refer a lot to Wade Nobles and his book, African Psychology. Wade talks about three cultural dispositions that I think would help in helping the client to reframe or somehow change something around. These African dispositions include improvisation, transcendence, and transformation. The idea here being that if you can teach a client to improvise, to somehow if plan A doesn't work, then go to plan B. I think you're gonna be more effective in being able to work with them. If you can teach them to transcend, that means that sometimes you just have to rise above a particular situation, go around and then just leave it alone. Ah, African people have a saying that says, sometimes it just be like that. What it means is that regardless of what you do, you have no control over this particular situation and sometime you have to be able to just be comfortable enough to just leave it, be disappointed that it didn't work out, that something's going on, that this didn't turn out the way you want it, and just rise above that situation and leave it rather than sitting there and spinning your wheels and trying to knock your head against the brick wall that isn't gonna move. The third idea in proposition transcendence is transformation. The idea is can you take a negative element or entity and transform it into something positive. That means, can you take an experience that has been very, very negative for you and transform it into something where you learned something about it and learn to grow and prosper from that negative experience. Transformation, that's also related to the idea of helping them to appreciate the creative synthesis of opposites and fruitful harmony. Now, the idea that self, that, that reframing concept, the improvisation, transcendence, and transformation may be incorporated into other counseling techniques that we use ah, is, is, is, ah, fairly likely. But being able to catch in language that is specific to Afrocentric ah, of frame of reference of values system may be real important to facilitate in that client's understanding into helping them endorse that particular concept as they move toward setting goals. The third issue, in terms of setting goals here, that we wanna talk about is helping a client to have, perhaps what is called the culturally collective experience. What that means essentially is that if you understand the law of digestion in, in the human body, digestion is an innate process of discrimination and analysis. When we ingest into our body, food, and, and, and, and liquid substances that somehow our body then through the digestive organs, separates out that which is good and stores it up for our body's use and expels through different ah, parts of our body that which is waste. Well, if we understand our connectedness to just physical properties and, and our physical organism, having a culturally collective experience for lot of African-Americans is real important. Why? Because living in a world that provides very little support in validation for being an African-American person requires that you just ingest a lot of this material. Ah, sometimes it comes from the family, it comes from the immediate community, it comes from school, it comes from the media, it comes from so many different places, and so much of that material that we ingest is very, very negative and contrary to the development of a healthy self-esteem. So what I would argue is that, you, as a therapist have an obligation to help that person have a culturally collective experience which in fact might facilitate then analyzing what it is that they ingest into their minds and then to their spirits. Separating out that which is good for them and is, is, is necessary to sustain and facilitate growth and then trying to help them dispel and purge from their minds and their bodies that information that is somehow detrimental to their existence and, and uhm, uhm, uhm, very disordered in terms of their own functioning as an African-American client. The fourth issue, in terms of the setting goals, as an example, is restoration of balance. And the idea here being, that remember, African people focus on the sense of harmony and balance within the universe. What is it in the client's life that has gotten him out of balance? What is it has gotten him, ah, ah, you know, in disharmony with something. Now, I caution you when you look at balance and that concept to resist the temptation to think about control. What we're talking about here is not a client absolutely controlling different things within their environment. Control is a, is, is a very Eurocentric concept. The idea here is not so much to control different things that happened in your life, control your relationship, control your mate, control things around you, but how do you teach a person to restore the balance by living in harmony with what's going on. That is really the focus here. Now, as we wind down, in terms of this particular segment of our, our discussion, the idea is that, if in fact, we're going to be effective at working with African-American populations, we've gotta be able to answer two primary questions, what and how. What do we wanna do, how do we wanna do it. What we wanna do is to be more sensitive in working with folks and I think that one of the things that your might be able to do as counselors is in fact break the therapeutic focus down into three component parts. We wanna connect with clients, we wanna facilitate awareness, and we wanna set goals. The second question then is, how do we do that? And so what I invite you to do is consider some of these suggestions that we've talked about today or erase all of these. As you engage in your reading, as you engage in your study, as you engage in professional development seminars that are may be conducted by the Association of Black Psychologist, either local chapters and national conventions or the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development or other professional entities that provides you with that knowledge base. See if you can abstract from your own readings, from your own professional development, from your own training, specific skills that might allow you to be more effective in working with African-American clients. Now, also remember that sometimes the client knows themselves very well and that they are the best expert on themselves. And so the idea is there's nothing wrong with really asking a client and learning from our clients what it is that we could be doing in the therapeutic process that would make that process much more humanistic and much more facilitating in terms of them being able to work on their ah, particular issue. In closing what I'm saying, the need to move away from culturally generic models and approaches and into more cultural specificity is really apparent. If we're going to be effective at working with African-American populations, I think it's incumbent upon each of us to try to examine ways in which we can incorporate an Afro-centric theory, and Afro-centric value system into our own therapeutic practice. You may also want to consider, in term, in addition to these particular skills, the degree to which the therapeutic approach that you are utilizing, be it Freudian, be it ah, ah, Ellison cognitive behavioral approaches, be it Rogers and, and client-centered approaches or Gestalt approaches or transactional analysis approaches or ego psychology, whatever it might be, whatever therapeutic approach you're using, is that approach sensitive to the cultural nuances that we need to be talking about or working with African-American clients. Does it make the kinds of assumptions that allow for you to connect with the client, facilitate awareness, and setting goals? Does the prescribed a role for you as a therapist, and a counselor, that it is somehow consistent with what you need to be doing to be ineffective with African-American clients? If you can begin to examine those particular issues with your clients, I think that would go a long way of trying to cut down on the fact that still today, of all African-American clients who come into therapy, more than 50 percent of them are terminated in therapy after the first session. I believe that what goes on in the therapy session is very, very important and we can make some headway of doing that. I'm Thomas Parham and I'd like to thank you for being a part of this particular presentation, and I'll invite you to continue to grow, continue to engage in professional development. Good day.
