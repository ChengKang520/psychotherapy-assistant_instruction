Dr. Clark Moustakas: 

00:00:10
Reflections on Relationship 

00:00:10
Play Therapy 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN Dr. Clark Moustakas, has long been recognized as one of the leading pioneers in the conceptualization and development of the field of play therapy. And specifically, relationship play therapy. Dr. Moustakas earned doctoral degrees from Union Graduate school and Columbia University. He is founder and president of the Center for Humanistic Studies in Detroit. As well as, Senior Consultant and core faculty member in Psychology at the Union Institute in Cincinnati. Dr Moustakas's career has been notable for his insightful explorations of the inner world of the children in play therapy. He is a prolific writer and includes in his impressive bibliography of over twenty books such notable works, as psycho therapy with children, children in play therapy, existential child therapy, and relationship play therapy. In this interview the warm, sensitivity, and humanness of Clark Moustakas, the person, emergence as he explores what it means to be fully with a child and allowing the child to be the person the child is at that moment. His reflections on a lifetime of play therapy experiences with children instruct and promote insightful explorations. This was Dr. Moustakas's last professional presentation before his retirement. Interviewing Dr Moustakas is Dr. Garry Landreth regents professor at the department of council education and director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas. 

00:01:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Welcome, you Dr. Clark Moustakas, to uh, the campus of the University of North Texas and Center for Play Therapy. And I am just delighted that you are here, and that you have taken time form your busy schedule to be with us and visit with us, and I am anxious to visit with you and hear about your start in play therapy and your development in play therapy. Uh, would you mind starting there and uh, sharing with us how you first became interested in play therapy? 

00:02:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I first became interested in play therapy in reading Carl Roger's writings and Virginia Axline book was published I think in 1947, on play therapy. I then was a graduate student at Wayne state university in Detroit, and I was also a student at the Meryl Palmer Institute, which offered a much freer more liberal opportunity to make choices regarding what was important in learning. And I discovered that I had an immediate connection or, or way of being with children who were in the preschool, at the Meryl Palmer Institute, because as soon as I went into the room, all those children gathered around me and we began to create playful things together. I, I saw that I was not able to really develop a fundamental and deep rooted connectedness with any individual child because I was so constantly caught up with the group of 15 or 20 children. And I was kind of moving from one kind of activity to the other, in those different rooms there were all kinds of construction projects and sand and clay, and paint, and story telling. And I was moving from one place to another as a graduate student, both at Wayne and Meryl Palmer. And at that time, Amy Hallway, was the uh, psychologist who was the head of the program in play therapy at the Meryl Palmer Institute. And she observed me one day, when I was being with children in the preschool, and she approached me and asked me if I would like to learn how to do play therapy. Or how to understand play therapy. Because then she said we can arrange for you to meet with individual children if we are sure you have sufficient knowledge of play therapy. 

00:04:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, she saw this potential in you early on. 

00:04:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, yes she did, and Amy became a very close friend of mine the remainder of the time I was at Meryl Palmer. Uh, Amy's own training was with OH Mouher at Harvard. And she was, what today would be called a cognitive behavioral play therapist. I didn’t feel comfortable with the way in which she communicated and related with children, but she was very accepting of my much more spontaneous, um, kind of exploring, searching, discovering ways. I didn’t have a, a definite, I suppose it would, I would say it was child-centered I took my cues from children, but I was very quick to catch some particular gesture or movement that pointed to some interest or some activity and so I would connect with that. She valued that very much. And then I went on to Columbia university to complete my Doctors degree and that is where I studied with Virginia Axline, Virginia, I took a course on play therapy with Virginia Axline, and Virginia observed, it was a very small group, she limited the class to ten students. And we each were assigned to work with children in play therapy. And uh, she observed and then afterwards there would be some discussion of feedback about our work. Um, so, I sort of moved from uh, a completely, I'd say open kind of way of discovering what was essential in connecting, and making contact with children, and how to make resources available so that those children could move toward self determination, self growth, uh, resolution of what ever problems they were experiencing. But one thing that I believe represented an original direction for play therapy, when I was at Meryl Palmer, after I completed my work at uh, Columbia, uh, Amy Hallway called me and offered we a position at Meryl Palmer. And I was so excited to be able to work again with Amy Hallway, because she, for me had been a the most beautiful person of enabling and allowing. Always sharing her own ideas and perceptions and observations, but so much with an attitude of, of freedom for me to discover for myself, what was congruent with my own way of being with children. And she valued that. A tragedy occurred, and she died, the, about two weeks before I was to begin my work with her and so I was given the entire responsibility for the play therapy program at the Meryl Palmer Institute having only had about a year of experience in working with children, in play therapy. And, it was a very challenging year because the entire department of psychology at Meryl Palmer was psycho-analytic and so here I was having come out of teachers college Columbia University and influenced by Virginia Axline and Carl Rogers, and Nicholas Hopps and I am approaching my involvement with uh, children in a in a child centered, or person centered way. Uh, there was in that something that I was bringing that I didn’t take from my experience from any other people that I studied with or trained with or who guided me, and that was I very early in my work as a play therapist realized that the most important dimension of play therapy is the relationship. The relationship between a child and the therapist. And it was, it was that which captured my attention, it was that which gave me energy uh, I didn’t sit in the chair and observe and reflect feelings and contact, as Virginia did. Uh, when I observed her that may have shifted in later years, but when I was a student at Columbia, it was very inappropriate to get out of the chair. It was necessary to sit and to reflect content and feelings and behavior of children as they moved. That was shown to be effective. And, it was effective, but it didn’t fit my way of being, and I, I needed to be more active. So the relationship for me meant mixing, and sorting and shifting and being with children in the sand, in the painting. Not imposing but, it was sort of like the way in which mountain climbers do. Somebody is in the lead position, and then there is the re-layer, with the rope determining how much slack, I felt that I was like a re-layer, on a mountain climber. This child was climbing to some peak discovery of self, or of, uh, feeling, or of thought or of meaning, and I was, I was there and I knew just when, somehow intuitively and through my experience to offer something. In the way of slack. 

00:10:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH It sounds as though you are describing a process in which the child is taking the two of you to the top of the mountain. 

00:10:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, I really learned how to be with children in that kind of a journey, through my connectedness, through my relationship with children in play therapy. Uh, and originally I recorded their, there were several people connected with a while series of research projects, with an observation room, and audio, visual equipment. And these interviews were being uh, tape recorded then, in the very early years, not video. But they were all tape recorded so I was able to have available to me exact transcriptions. And so, in children in play therapy there are a number of those direct examples as they are in some of the writings you have done in play therapy. And I think people have continued to discover that the language of children as it is expressed and unfolds, is very important for people who want to learn, uh, some of the principles and values and approaches to therapy. UH, I think its much more important that those, I know in the beginning sometimes, at least with my students, they want to know the skills and the techniques and the methods, they are more comfortable with those. But its interesting, after about a year I notice they throw those out, and they are much more in to the values of um, connecting, making contact, uh, creating a relationship, discovering ways of being with children. 

00:11:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Clark, several times you've mentioned making a connection with the child. Um, could you explain that in your words a little bit more, what that is to you when you, when your in contact with the child. 

00:12:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I have language in different ways. And if I went, if you went back to my early experience I would have described it in one way, uh, describing it today I would say, it’s a distinction between being in the world of a child in which my whole presence is to simply immerse myself in that world in order to understand it. And to be in it and to facilitate or support it. Uh, by that I mean uh, if I can point to something in the play room, that the child is moving toward, but hasn’t quite connected with, but my pointing to uh, enables a connection to be made, and then I see the child take the next step in that exploration or in that search, or in that resolution that is what I mean by being in the world of the child. Then there is a way of being for. What I mean for a child, I really am there not just to make available uh, new ways of, of seeing, perceiving, or thinking, or feeling by my pointing to, or by making possible certain materials that I know uh, are necessary for this child to enter more deeply in to what ever it is that the child is searching toward. But when I being for, I am really am advocate. I am there not just to make available things that will facilitate the child's uh, progress. But I am there as a full advocate, and I make school visits, and it doesn’t matter to me what the problems are that the schools are facing. My being there is to help the teachers understand this child, and I present the child's strengths and capabilities, and share with teachers what children are doing in play therapy, in the way of creative, constructive work. Now, they also may be doing many of the other things that are happening in school, I don’t focus on those. Uh, those are dimensions that the teachers want to focus on, but I stay with what I think is important for teachers to uh, attend to, regarding the child's possibilities for growth. Rather than reactive ways of correction and remediation. And dealing with the troubled things. Now. that doesn’t mean that in the therapy, I am not dealing with those things, but I am not taking those to the school. I want to, I have always wanted to be for a child. I can, I can remember a child I had seen in therapy who was one of the most profound and deeply rooted experience I had ever had, he was 12 years old, and he kept repeating I don’t know what to do with myself. I feel like killing myself, there is nothing in my life that matters to me, everybody hates me, my mother hates my, my father hates me, all the children in school hate me. My teachers hate me. He, and my being with him in, present as another human being, and understanding him, without making any attempts to change him, just being there with him, he turned to me in the second or third interview and he saw me as a human being who did not criticize him. Who did not reject him, who did not hate him, as a matter of fact, as someone who cared. Someone who is uh, with him. And it was a case that was very important because the entire clinic had an emergency meeting and, uh, was moving toward institutionalization of this boy. I believed that that would have destroyed him. He was just beginning to emerge in a way that he was beginning to show some of his uh, real talents, and real interests. As it turned out, in the third interview he began to share with me things that he had written. And I was stunned because his, what he was sharing with me was way beyond the sixth grade level that he was in at school, whereas at school he didn’t write anything. Anyway that’s an example of what I call being for. I really was for that boy. I would have brought my entire professional life into his world as a way of giving him support and strength. And, I emphasized the positive things, and not the negative things. 

00:16:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Now, it sounds as though your describing a process in which, you, you see your role as being one of discovering, viewing, seeing, the very best within the child, and then helping other people to see that very best. 

00:17:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, that would be true whether I am being in that world, and facilitating further expressions of it, whether I am being for the child and supporting and affirming the child with other adults in the world, or whether I am being with the child. What you just described that is calling up the very best resources of that child's being. But when I am being with its, its a true interactive process where I am learning and participating at the same time that I am offering and providing ways of myself. Its a that, that being with is very much like what we would describe as an I thou relationship. Except he describes it as something instantaneous, that its fleeting, it happens quickly and it disappears. But in therapy when I am being with a child, it may go on indefinitely. That being with is sustained over a period of time. And maybe there throughout our entire relationship. 

00:18:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH As I listen to you describe that I hear you being energized by that being with. 

00:18:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes. Yes. To some extent here we are being with each other. When you are expressing Ideas that connect with mine or not just ideas, but values, ideas um, and they connect with my values and ideas, there is a different way of languaging them and something of you comes through as something of me comes through. I have that sense I've always had that sense with you, Garry of there being an interactive process which, um, allows each of us to be who we are, and to offer each other what we can, in the way of understanding. 

00:19:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I appreciate your saying that uh, being with you is easy, you make it easy to be with you. I wanted to ask, in one of your books you wrote that the challenge of therapy is to wait with interest and concern for the child, and to activate the will. What, what did you mean by that? 

00:19:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I learned over a number of years in those early years, maybe the first ten years of practicing play therapy as a play therapist I learned ultimately uh, to be patient. To really be able to be present in a patient waiting sense. I also believed very deeply that the child had within him or her the powers to, of self determination, and self fate. And could direct that process, I didn’t learn that well at my early years of practice, I sometimes would feel so deeply the pain and anguish of a child I would want to alleviate it. And, so I would I would act out of my own will. I learned that that had a value but it didn’t have the depth of value of a shift in direction or meaning that came from the child himself, or herself. And that activating the will uh, the will came to be the absolute source and I realized that no matter how much damaging a criticism a rejection, rebuke, pain, a child has experienced, there is something there in every child in the way of will. And that, at some moment, when there is sufficient human presence and I think patience, its not something that in any way can be uh, can be um, moved in the way that now its being emphasized in brief therapy. That we know certain conditions will lead to certain results, but these are, this doesn’t have to do with conditions and results, this has to do with the awakening of the the will. Uh, and what I discovered was, in time that when I could be patient, and that patience didn’t have a timing, that a child would begin to express whatever uh, feeling, though, interest, and I think vividly, or I see vividly a girl, a little girl she was about six, she was very frightened to come to the path therapy with me. Her mother came down to the uh, place, it was a lower level of the waiting room with us, and waited outside the room. I left the door open so the child could see her mother, but she stood in the center of the room. That, and I did what I was comfortable doing initially, and that was to reflect her feelings and uh, um share it with her that I understood that coming to this strange place with a strange man could be scary. She didn’t say anything, and, but ultimately, I remained silent, and that’s when something beautiful happened between us. My silence she received as an acceptance, of full deep acceptance of her being frightened, standing in the center of the room, not moving, but slowly she did she did make a, she moved from one balance, she balanced her body from one side to the other. And eventually she did take a step toward some of the materials that were in the room. and she began to play. The eventually took three sessions, I believe. I really felt the significance of patience then, and waiting. And I believe waiting is one of the most important principles of play therapy. In our society, so much of everything is done in a hurry. The faster its done the better. Uh, something I wonder if people, I certainly had to learn myself to savor the patience and the waiting. To find waiting uh, a value of absolute significance. Uh, most of the transitions in my life since then have come out of my uh, a waiting process, the will of the will wasn’t ready to express itself in some direction. But, it did and that’s one thing that led me to what I shared with you earlier, the resolve to remove myself from the everyday schedule. Uh, something happened one day. That awakened in me a very strong uh, sense that the internal world was rising up and saying you must find another space for your life. And a time that is not scheduled. Somehow that arose in me, I mean it was really in my consciousness, very strongly so it could not be shaken by whatever pressures the world may bring to me. 

00:25:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, it sounds as though, this was a point of self discovery. A new part of yourself emerging. 

00:25:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, definitely. But I believe it emerged out of the final uh, blow or straw of the will that would no longer accept constantly being thwarted and substituting for my own willful directions. The external responsibilities. 

00:26:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, it sounds as though what your describing is that the will is the desire to live and if the child does not have the opportunity to exercise the will, there may be no desire to live fully. 

00:26:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, yes. and its this uh, exercising, or this reawakening or awakening of the will that has a different time table for different children. So therefore, waiting is not something that can be scheduled or defined in terms of so many hours, or so much time. To wait uh, is, is a pure value in a sense. That whatever it is that is present in that moment, is okay, just as it is, and it doesn’t have to go anywhere, or be anything. it can just be. 

00:27:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And you are waiting for the child then releases something in the child. 

00:27:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, I believe the child experiences that as an affirmation of him or her. And, an affirmation of his or her colors to make the decision of when I want, what I want to do or when I want to act or what I want to say or how I want to be. 

00:27:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The decision to live. 

00:27:30
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS The decision to live, and to express oneself in that life, or not. 

00:27:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, the for you then, the waiting for and being with, are the most, it sounds as though your saying they are the most crucial dimensions. 

00:27:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes. that is the most crucial dimension, and I believe I came to that or I learned its meaning, from my very organism, through some very deep painful, critical hours of therapy. Such as the 12 year old boy, who was on the verge of taking his own life. Over the years, I have worked with extreme examples of children who parents and others wanted to institutionalize. Brain injured children, children who were um, labeled as brain injured, children who were labeled disabled in various ways. Um, uh, children who were labeled mentally retarded, or physically uh, disabled, or um, brain injured so many of those label I found have no meaning what's so ever once I came to uh, a life with the child. And among the things I did which I can look back on with a great deal of uh, a sense of fulfillment is there were many, many children I kept out of institutions. I found school for them I found teachers who were unusual teachers who were willing to take one or two children in their classrooms. And then I I stayed in that, I visited the classroom, and I had conversations with the teachers. But many of those children survived, they went through the entire school system. Unusual children, a few of them I still see, they still call me. They are people in their 40s, uh and we meet maybe once or twice a year, and they come and they share with me some of the things they are doing in their lives now. 

00:29:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You helped to save their lives. 

00:29:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I believe so, I think that for me, uh, witnessing that kind of emergence, continuity and endurance, has been probably in my work as play therapist, the most rewarding experience I've had. Because there are so many people who can work with people, with children, and others who have problems, uh, that are disturbing problems, but there are very few people who will work with the outcasts. Those who are the sub deviant, and so out of touch, that there is no place for them. There still are not places for those children, and I am still involved with my own work in trying to find places. I think the deinstitutionalization was great but it left an openness and a gap now that I think is important for people to keep working and finding resources in the community for those uh, children and young adults. 

00:30:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Clark, I'd like to shift the focus just a little bit. You've written that without limits there can be no therapy. What did you mean by that? 

00:31:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS First, I meant that every, I just I came to see that limits first of all, and most essential have to do with the boundaries of ones self. I am limited, I am limited by my size, my weight, my strength. The shape of my body, my height. Uh, I did discover at times there were things I could do that I never imagined I could do bodily, such as, when a child would climb up on furniture and ask me to climb up on the top of bookshelves, and I didn’t think I could manage that but, I did manage to see things. Because seeing things from the top of bookshelves, for some children who operate under a different perceptual framework than the normal child, uh, was a very different thing. I really did see things differently from up above. Or from down below lying on the floor looking up. Or from different angles in the room. So that’s an example of that kind of, of emergence of, that’s an example of stretching the limits. Because, I had a certain sense for example, that there are safety limits, there are health limits, there are security limits, and I truly believe that those were absolute and they had to register, I, for example, I would not permit a child to throw things at me. Well, I discovered that there were some children, the only way I would be able to relate with them, if I permitted them to throw things at me. And I learned that a long, long time ago with a boy who turned out all the lights in the room and then he started throwing things at me. And I was covered with paint and my clothes were torn, and so on and so forth. So I said to him, okay, if this is the way you and I are going to create a life together, than next time we meet I am going to bring my oldest clothes, you can tear them, you can cut them, you can do anything you want with them, but, this outfit I now have on is ruined, and I don’t have so many outfits that I can have you ruin each time. Something really exciting happened, I came in with my old clothes, they were beat up clothes, I met him in the lobby, he was embarrassed to see me in that way, he was embarrassed for his parents to see me in that way. We went down to the play room, he never again threw things at me, and then we really could get in to some of the things that were important, that he was needing to work out. 

00:33:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH In your relationships with children, do you ever set any limits? 

00:33:40
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Well, this is what I was saying Garry, I, I am reluctant to say that this is an absolute absolute limit, and I am reluctant to say that because, there may be a child that I will meet, where I will strongly believe that this would be the catalyst that would transition or shift, that would be crucial, and I would then not set the limit. Now, in that case, for example I would not have darts in the room, or if it were darts thrown at me, that would be an absolute limit, I would remove them from the room and say I will not bring these back until you can accept that you can use the darts in certain ways but not to throw them at me. Because the darts I am talking about have about three inch nails at the end of them and I would be seriously injured. But I did find out that I could take a lot of punching, and tumbling and live with it if I believed that it was an essential uh, turning point in my life with child. Now, it doesn't it, when I was seeing many, many children that very, very rarely happened. And, I learned that out of an experience, I can remember with a boy, who was determined that he was going to throw everything at me in the room. And so, I began saying to him, this is out of bounds now, you've thrown these things in my direction, you may not, you may not go into this area of the play room. Well pretty soon there was not, no area of the play room left but a little a space in the center of the room where I was holding him. And then he was kicking me and moving around, and, all at once in the midst of his kicking and screaming and wailing, and my saying to him, I was not going to permit him to uh, punch me, and I was doing everything I could to stop him. And in essence I did, occasionally some punch came through, but all at once he totally relaxed, his whole body was in a state of complete relaxation, and he cuddled up in my lap and he went to sleep. We never had that experience again. It, from that point on the while therapy was directed toward play things, and constructions and sharings that he wanted to do with me. So, when you ask about limits, limits are very connected with will also, because, every time I limit a child I am also restraining the child's will. And a child's a willful expressing being, and its very, very strong for him or her at that point to carry out this act. And I am restraining the will. What I try to do, or what I've tried to do and I don’t know how much that meant to a child, was to distinguish between the child's behavior, and the child's will, or the child's attitude, or the child. The child's self. I don’t think that was ever successful because a child is a whole being and the behavior is as much in the child, as the child. But, uh, I sometimes would start there. Ultimately, I tried to find alternatives where the will could still be expressed with its power and its freedom, and most often I was successful. I was more experienced and experimented with. I discovered more and more ways, there are alternative paths that children can take without in any way restraining or inhibiting the will. And in those instances I think I feel much better when I can set a limit that does not tamper with the will of the child. 

00:37:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So that the child is still in some way in control and can exercise the will. 

00:37:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yes, that’s a very clear way of saying it. 

00:37:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Clark, we hear a lot today, um, in the literature and in presentations at conferences about uh, um, approach, the approach that the therapist needs to take should vary with the age of the child with the problem, perhaps you need to take a different approach with this problem and another approach with this problem. How do you react to that? 

00:38:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Well, I, I believe, there is certain common qualities that. for example, uh, careful empathic, sympathetic listening is just as important for a very young child as it is for an older child, or an adolescent adult. In other words, I believe there are certain principles and values that obtain regardless of gender or age. But I also believe there are differences. The differences, to some degree, have to do with gender and age, and maybe other factors, ethnicity, race, culture. But I think, they also are related to, a, the uniqueness and individuality of a particular person. So, for me it’s a discover process. I don’t in advance know how I am going to respond in a situation of a child who is older has had other kids of experiences. I would probably not take such a child to a play room, or if I, if, I might offer an option, I might take first a child who is 12 or 13, I might take such a child to a play room, and also to my office, and ask the child which uh, which is preferred. I have found that older children are not completely comfortable, many in meeting with me in my office and engaging in conversation the way that an adult does. But, then sometimes what happens is the child, that person and I create a certain kinds of play materials in my office that the child can use if the child wants to. Or the child brings things from home, that can be used during that time. I think the main point I want to make is, that each time is a new time, with older children, with individuals who come from different ethnic background or culture, or racial background. And what is required needs to be discovered, who I'm to be with this person is a new being, I've never been with this, I've been with lots of children and I've been with lots of adolescents, but this person who is coming is a in some ways unlike any of those other people. And I believe I first have to connect with that uniqueness and individuality before I can find a common basis for our uh, relationship. 

00:41:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So its sounds as though, your approach is certainly not prescriptive. 

00:41:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS It is not prescriptive, and it is not diagnostic, it was then, once I got past my nondirective child centered phase, it was then a discover a process, rooted in a relationship. I believe it is still a discover process, rooted in a relationship. And are all the varying ingredients of a persons being in the world, need to be uh, met, related to, responded to. 

00:41:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Clark, with the current emphasis on all of counseling, on diagnosis, and cause and cure and um, brief therapy, um, your words from your earliest writings encouraging the direction of the child, and the process and the will as you've been talking here today, take on new and added meaning, how would you encourage play therapists today, uh, to resist the often extreme pressure to rush children through therapy or to work on just one specific cause, to be very prescriptive. What word of encouragement would you have for a play therapist? 

00:42:45
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS The words I think of, is being inventive. Uh, um, meeting the external requirements in that, there may not be other choices that uh, this is a material world in which, uh, the people we educate and train and work with, must uh, must connect. Such as the whole managed care emphasis. Which, limits the number of sessions, and which requires a diagnosis. But I suggest to my students that uh, they can write something external uh, to satisfy the requirement, and others, who only understand something written, out of some diagnostic, external framework, in a time limit sense. And in a lineal way, in a goal oriented way, where the goals and objectives need to be clear, specified, and the timeframe by which those goals will be satisfied, and then the evidence for data that’s collected to verify that those goals have been satisfied. That they do that but that that be a secondary activity, that the primary activity be to enter in and uh, allow for a timeless unfolding of the therapeutic relationship. 

00:44:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So, then you would encourage play therapists to be true to themselves. 

00:44:15
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Absolutely. 

00:44:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Clark as early as the 1950s you were suggesting, advocating in your writings and your books then that parents have special play times uh, perhaps similar to a play therapy session, in their own home. 40 years later, um, how do you feel about those reccommendations? 

00:44:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I feel equally strongly about those recommendations, including for myself. Uh, I have ten grandchildren who come to my home, and we have a play room. And while Betty and the children who are adults meet and share things, I am in the playroom with the grandchildren. And we are creating various kinds of play experiences. Uh, in that time before children and play therapy was published, I received a letter from Carl Roger's daughter she was having a difficult time finding a way to understand and be with her children. I suggested that she set up a play room, and that she set aside a special time where shed meet with her two children together and then meet individually. Uh, she didn’t feel confident to do that without some kid of training. So she would call me or write to me, and we had these frequent exchanges. And she I think, published the first paper on a parent doing play therapy with her children. I don’t know whether you know that. 

00:45:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Yes, I am aware of that. 

00:45:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Nataly Fuchs. And, she's now Nataly Rogers. 

00:45:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH They were struggling with potty training, was one of them. 

00:45:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Struggling with potty training, and being very frustrated. And it was just a beautiful unfolding. Because I learned as much from here about the creation of a play room. Or a place setting in the home, and setting aside a special time as a parent when a parent can be with child. And then later I asked both the mother and father to participate. Not only in the play rooms with me at the school but to set a play situation at home. And what I learned was, that very often a child who had been terrified to say what it was that was terrifying the child, would begin to express that in the context of the special setting in the home. Where the whole purpose was to allow a child freedom to express. Whereas in the home the spilling and messing, and tearing, and so on, could not take place, in the play room it could. And they were to set it up in a way that uh, all of that could happen. It seemed important that the freedom of a child to spill and mess and play in those various ways, opened up a channel then to communicate what it was in the child or in the child's relationship with the parents that was troubling. And it tended to move the therapy much more quickly when the parent was doing the play therapy at home, while I was also seeing the individual child or the child and the parents in the play room at school. 

00:47:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Clark, this was such um, a dramatic departure from therapy in the 50s, to involve the parent in that way. 

00:47:35
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Yeah, to believe that parents could do play therapy, without having a degree or without having special credentials for it. 

00:47:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, that must have taken some courage in your part o uh, suggest something that at that time truly was viewed as being radical. 

00:48:00
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I often uh, found myself uh, off on some path that uh, that was contrary to the mainstream. Without, uh, involving myself with the mainstream so I wasn’t especially aware that this was such an innovation to be, it seemed like such a natural uh, direction to move in, in light of what was happening. That if children in a play therapy room could begin to come to terms with whatever it was troubling them, and to begin to establish different patterns of creating and relating, that its seemed very simple to me that that should be possible in a family setting. What made it work is that it was set up, in a way, just in the way the play therapy was set up. And, it was a separate part, its own special place and where it ould happen there and not other places, just like in the play therapy room. That kind of, whatever kind of unfolding needs to take place, can take place there. But it cant spill out into other rooms in a university building. Just as, in any case, I think it was the same it didn’t seem to me so far reaching, or so unusual. It seemed like kind of a natural unfolding of a process. But, I will say something, and that is somehow I always had the courage to follow my own uh, intuition. My own internal guide. 

00:49:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I have something welling up in me, that I want to share with you, as I listen to you talk. And what's welling up in me is, if I were a lonely child, I would want to be with you. 

00:49:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Uh, huh, I am moved by that. 

00:49:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Yeah. 

00:49:55
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I am. 

00:50:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH You would understand I know that. 

00:50:05
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS I believe I would. 

00:50:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And I think children know that, and experience that. 

00:50:10
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS There is a passage in uh, that as you say that, that I would like to read from Who Will Listen. 

00:50:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Please do. 

00:50:20
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS That is so much in my being that I could say it without reading it, but it wouldn’t, it wouldn't have the kind of language in it that’s there. Its like, well, I was, when I was thinking of coming here I went back to all these books, and this was a piece that really stood out for me. Of the many challenges that children face in their relations with parents and other significant adults, none is more devastating than the continual experience of not being listened to. Not being heard. What does it mean to really know another person in significant moments of that persons life? To hear the range of voices, variations of speech, the tones and textures, sounds of joy and anger, the mixture of sadness and laughter. The edgy uncertain words of fear, the myriad facial and body expressions, the lengthy silences and continuing stream of words that seem never to stop coming, and all the ups and downs of ecstasy and misery. To fully know another person is a long journey of listening, feeling, sensing, risking, trusting, doubting, joining, wondering alone, fighting, loving, supporting, opposing, laughing, weeping. Such a relationship follows its own unique path. There are no tangible or predictable guides. There are no prescribed rules and regulations. The nature substance, and character of a particular moment between two persons, is unique and can never be replicated. Knowing the other person, and knowing myself with this person, living the relationship in a full and complete way, creating a unique and incomparable experience, these are the basic challenges of any encounters with children and parents in therapy. I have attempted to portray these challenges in the process of creating and pointing positively to the uniqueness, the unpredictability, and the mystery of human engagement. The spirit which exists between human, two human beings suddenly emerges into specific play forms and play activities, and sparks a light that grows from darkness. 

00:53:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And you have sparked a light in so many children, and in so many play therapists, and a light in my life through your writings and uh, the brief times that we had to share together, Clark. And uh, I am just sitting here feeling very satisfied with uh, our time today, and appreciate so much, uh, your sharing yourself, here today, thank you. 

00:53:50
DR. CLARK MOUSTAKAS Thank you.
