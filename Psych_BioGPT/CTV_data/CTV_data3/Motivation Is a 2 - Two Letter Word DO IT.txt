DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is: Motivation is two 2-letter word "Do It!" We are at Day 16 now, so you are now halfway through the core content on the 30 days of the Daily Practice Is Not A Luxury Item portion of our program. A client came into my office describing a complex trauma history dating back from abuse in her early childhood until more reason to death, a severe bullying and harassment in work place. She told me she had little or no motivation through any of the things she felt would help her in her recovery. We spoke about how motivation at the early stage of recovery is often, what we came to call a fool's game, because, we're really not likely to have any of that beautiful stuff called motivation, we're simply not motivated, we're too pleaded and running as fast as we can already. Motivation happens when we are already in the rhythm of an activity, or we are still excited about the possibility of something new. Well, when we really need to change our lives to grow, to recover that takes hard work and this type of effort comes from a place deep inside, a place that helps us push through even when we are tired, scared, uncertain. So, motivation won't work. The other piece that gets in the way is an expectation that we need the right place, time or some special ingredient to find motivation. Forget about that as well. So, it's not like you are gonna need a new outfit in order to start to walk a waking machine. That just won't work. There's no right place or time or a special new thing or outfit you can buy. Finally, here is a piece around self-betrayal that keeps us from moving forward and the biggest question I ask you right now are these. Instead, what does work is, one not knowing it would be easy. So, you got to know this is not an easy task, moving yourself forward. Two, not expecting the effort to come from a sense of motivation. Three, understanding that this starts with hard work and daily practice. And four, know that there will be days that you simply do not want to do it, but you do it anyways and five, know that they are going to be some days that it's okay to take a day off and you will know the difference if you are honest with yourself. True change and growth comes from daily practice, dedication and perseverance. And the efforts to push past inertia is what really gets people moving forward in their trauma recovery and daily practice and new habits required to heal. Let's practice together. If you could really fully recover from your trauma, one, what would your life look like? Two, What would that feel like? And three, what frightens you about that vision? Remember, and now I'm going to repeat myself, instead what does work is know it will not be easy. Don't expect that. Don't expect the effort to come from some sense of motivation. Three, understand that this starts with hard work and daily practice. Expect that and four, know that there will be days that you simply do not want to, but you do it anyway. And five, know that there will be some days that it's okay to take a day off. You are gonna know the difference if you are honest with yourself. True change and growth comes from daily practice, dedication and perseverance and the efforts required to push past inertia is what really gets people moving forward in their daily recovery and the daily practice and new habits required to heal. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to be recapture feelings of comfort or calm or really to reclaim this idea of the work that it takes. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
