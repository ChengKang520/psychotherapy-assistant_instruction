Microtraining Associates is a Divisions of Alexander Street Press 800.889.5937 703-212-8520 sales@alexanderstreet.com www.alexanderstreet.com Microtraining Associates Presents Narrative Mediation with Couples Part One Gerald Monk Ph.D. Introducing the Process 

00:00:25
GERALD MONK Have you either of you been to mediation before? 

00:00:30
MONICA No. 

00:00:30
GERALD MONK Okay, so what I'd like to do to start is to explain to you what the mediation process is about. So if you bear with me for a couple of minutes, kinda describe the process and I-- you probably receive some information, ah, from one of our general staff that you spoke to make the appointment, ah, Monica. But just to kind of ha-- have us all kind of be clear about what we're doing here today. Uhm, the first thing I wanna say though is to congratulate both of you for making a decision about exploring resolving your issues for mediation. I think that's fantastic so I'm delighted to be sitting with you and working with you. Uhm, I want you to know that, uhm, the role that I have is one of, of a facilitator. So I don't have any authority, uhm, like a judge or are able to impose some kind of decision on either of you. So, really, this is over to the two of you as to how far you get in attending to the concerns that you have, uhm, ah, developing more understanding about what the issues are for one of you and perhaps, ah, making some agreements. Uhm, I understand, ah, you know that we're gonna be here for two hours for our first meeting. And that it's very likely that we will not be able to talk about all of the issues today but we will do so over the next, uhm, perhaps up to three to four meetings. Is that gonna be okay with you in terms of that, that timeframe? 

00:02:00
MONICA No. 

00:02:05
GERALD MONK Uhm, so, uhm, this is, this is a confidential, uhm, process so, uhm, ah, it's, uhm, one that I'm need to honor the, the things that you speak about. The private matters to do with, uhm, your, ah, issues of relationship. In rare occasions where, uhm, people, uhm, may be at risk of harming themselves or another. That, that would be the only incidence that I would ever be in a role of needing to step outside of that. And I have to say that because I'm also a licensed marriage and family therapist in, you know, Southern California. I'm required to, to follow a protocol. 

00:02:45
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:02:45
GERALD MONK Uhm, uhm, sometimes what happens is that we may be getting into some discussions that might lend themselves best to meeting with you separately for a period of time. So, uhm, David, I might meet with you for a period of time, uhm, and discuss, uhm, matters, uhm, that are important to you and then I would do the same with you Monica. Ensure the best I can that you have equal time. Uhm, because I'm wanting to ensure that I can be as even-handed as possible in terms of helping, uhm, address the concern you have. What will happen at the beginning is that one of you is likely to talk, uhm, for a period of time and then the others likely to talk for a period of time. So I want you to know that, uhm, just to be prepared for that and then maybe some things you want to say and kind of feel strongly about. That if you could hang on to those and, and, ah, ensure that you, ah, remember what those, uhm, responses are so we can come back to those. So, ah, in essence, I'm gonna give each of you, uhm, a number of minutes to really just help me understand what the issues are from each of your perspectives. 

00:03:55
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:03:55
Speaking to Hopes and Outcomes 

00:03:55
GERALD MONK So those are some of the kind of general guidelines, uhm, for this process. Do you have any questions about, uhm, any additional things or any things that I've said. 

00:04:10
MONICA No. Not right now. 

00:04:10
GERALD MONK Okay, great. I always like to start with, uhm, the, the final outcome in mind. And so, what I'd like for you each to do for a few minutes is to think about what would be our-- a, a good outcome from our time together and even to think about this time we have, decision as we're kind of completing decision. What would be some of the things you would be most appreciating about what you're, ah, the progress you're making and what you're getting out of, uhm, talking together. So, uhm, I'm fine about either of you starting off and I will just go backwards of forwards through the, through the process. 

00:04:50
DAVID Well, it's actually something that we've both talked about, you know, in the beginning of this process. We have had, uhm, friends who have gone through some bitter custody battles in divorce and, uhm, we really-- both of us, you know, back when we were together, ah, saw just how it tore the family apart and the destructive quality it had on both the relationship of both parents and with the child, you know. Dragging the child then, uhm, and we both had a discussion. 

00:05:20
GERALD MONK Ah, now that you-- the child, I understand it's Sam. 

00:05:25
DAVID Sam. 

00:05:25
GERALD MONK Whose five-years-old. 

00:05:25
DAVID That's right. 

00:05:25
GERALD MONK Is that correct? 

00:05:25
DAVID Yeah. 

00:05:25
GERALD MONK Okay. Yes. 

00:05:25
DAVID And, uhm, we both agreed that if, you know, whatever came down to-- something ever came up that bring us into a situation like we're in now, uhm, we would go mediation and try to have, ah, you know, a collaborative divorce as opposed to, you know, having one of these long child custody battles. So... 

00:05:50
GERALD MONK So one of the things you're wanting is to be able to collaborate together to work through whatever needs to be worked through - 

00:05:55
DAVID Right. 

00:05:55
GERALD MONK - with an outcome that's collaborative and doesn't end up in some law and drawn out legal, ah, process that is like your friends. 

00:06:05
DAVID Right. 

00:06:05
GERALD MONK So that's one of the things that you like. Okay, so how about, uhm, you Monica. What, uhm, what would be a great outcome for you. Uhm, let's think about even the session. 

00:06:15
MONICA Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, the most important thing for me is just to make sure Sam's gonna be okay. Uhm, my, ah, main concern is, uhm, that he's gonna be safe wherever he goes. That he's gonna not feel attention of whatever's going on. 

00:06:35
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:06:40
MONICA Uhm, so I just, I just wanna make sure he's gonna be okay. That's my main concern. 

00:06:40
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:06:45
MONICA Uhm, that we work together as parents, you know, to just make sure he's okay. That's, that's my main thing and make sure we take care of everything that needs to get taken cared of, uhm, and as best way as we can like, uhm, David said before. They just made some horrible situations and I don't wanna go that route, you know. Yeah. 

00:07:10
GERALD MONK Just to interrupt, uhm, ah, I didn't check with you. What's-- what I like to do is to make a few notes to myself as, as we go along and, ah, I hope that's gonna be okay with you and, uhm, and just keep-- it helps me keep track of things and then when there's some kind of basis for writing up some shared understandings of agreements, we've got-- I got the material there. Is that gonna be okay with you that I... 

00:07:30
MONICA Fine with me. 

00:07:30
GERALD MONK So, uhm, when I ask you that you, ah, you think of Sam and you want him to be protected, - 

00:07:35
MONICA Yes. 

00:07:35
GERALD MONK - uhm, not harmed at all by this - 

00:07:40
MONICA No. 

00:07:40
GERALD MONK - or to diminish the harm of these process that, that you're going through - 

00:07:45
MONICA Right. 

00:07:45
GERALD MONK - separating. And, ah, to have his interest in mind. 

00:07:50
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:50
GERALD MONK And that he's safe, cared for, and did I miss somethings? I think you might have added some other things. 

00:07:55
MONICA Oh, I guess just to make sure we kinda check everything off, as far as divorce goes, I mean, I, I think we're pretty much settled that we're not gonna end up together so... 

00:08:10
GERALD MONK Right. Yeah, but I'm, I'm just thinking of Sam and then - 

00:08:10
MONICA Oh, Sam. 

00:08:10
GERALD MONK - you kind of mentioned two things. So with Sam, we've talked about those things and also you're wanting to have, uhm, an amicable, uhm, separation and divorce. 

00:08:25
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:08:25
GERALD MONK And you, you have the same agenda as David. 

00:08:30
MONICA Yeah, pretty much. 

00:08:30
GERALD MONK You wanna, ah, collaborate about how this is done. 

00:08:30
MONICA Oh, yeah. As much as possible and then - 

00:08:35
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:08:35
MONICA - there's some things that I'm-- feel pretty strongly about. 

00:08:40
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:08:40
MONICA So. But, you know, that's why we're here. So... 

00:08:45
GERALD MONK Yes. 

00:08:45
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:08:45
GERALD MONK Uhm, so there might be some other things to. What if-- and I'm gonna ask you a little bit more so we get a good sense of what a good outcome is like for each of you. You've talked about collaboration together. What about Sam's health. Present as Sam in your mind regarding how this process happens. 

00:09:05
DAVID Well, very. I mean, he's part of me. I mean, he's - 

00:09:05
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:09:05
DAVID - my son. 

00:09:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10
DAVID Uhm, so of course I want the best for him. 

00:09:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10
DAVID As far as the safety goes, I think that's one of Monica's hang ups. It's one of the things that's, that's one of little points that she thinks that he's gonna be unsafe when he's around me and that isn't the case at all and I've told her that. You know, our relationship obviously is not gonna work out. I mean, this is the second time. We just did a separation, uhm, where we were separated for-- how long were we separated for? Six months, - 

00:09:45
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:09:45
DAVID - I think. So we've been back together for three months and all those problems that arose that we had before had been, you know, they just came right back. Uhm, so we were not able to resolve our relationship but the relationship with my son, yes. Of course, I feel very strongly about that. 

00:10:05
GERALD MONK So this would be a big priority for you all - 

00:10:05
DAVID Of course, yes. 

00:10:05
GERALD MONK - so in this, as you're kind of working things through, - 

00:10:10
DAVID Hmm. 

00:10:10
GERALD MONK - uhm, you want him to be safe. The, the same things obviously that Monica wants for Sam, you want for him too. 

00:10:15
DAVID Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:10:15
GERALD MONK Is that correct in terms of being protected and, and nurtured through this transition. 

00:10:20
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:10:25
GERALD MONK Uhm, ah, what other things would be, ah, helpful outcomes for, for Sam and the two of you as you transition this relationship from, from a, ah, one of being a, a married couple to one of being, uhm, parents of Sam but having to work and negotiate together into the future. 

00:10:50
DAVID I think if we could just make the transition from married, you know, partners to parents, you know, - 

00:11:00
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:11:00
DAVID - who are still able to discuss Sam's future and, you know, what's in Sam's best interests and not have the personal issues get in the way. I think, you know. 

00:11:15
MONICA Well cuz, I mean, Sam just tried at school too and there's so many decisions that-- I mean, I would be happy in taking, you know, making the decisions and things like that but I'm also very aware that, uhm, that Sam has a dad and that a dad should be him. Making some input here and there. And so I, I want that to happen for Sam. 

00:11:40
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:11:40
MONICA So-- but I just, I got-- we need to figure out how to make that happen. Yeah. 

00:11:50
GERALD MONK Uhm, so you're, uhm, aware that lots of decisions need to be made for his well-being. You've got really clear ideas about that and you also recognize that Sam has a dad and that David needs to be followed into that process so that it helps with this collaborative experience you wanna have. Is that, is that correct? 

00:12:15
DAVID Well, also I think, you know, any sort of interpersonal issues that we might have to get those results and take good care of so we can actually more forward and not have those effect are parenting styles. 

00:12:30
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. I, I have to say to you I'm, ah, a little bit surprised how clear you are about focusing on Sam because a lot of, a lot of couples I work with are so embroiled in the various painful encounters that they've had. It makes it really difficult for them - 

00:12:50
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:12:50
GERALD MONK - to see clearly that they have a child that needs to really be cared for and one of the best ways to do that is to, to do as what both of you are saying. Is to collaborate and find ways of, ah, try to manage your personal stuff so that Sam gets those experiences you described. And, ah, I guess, I'm just kind of wondering how it-- how have you been able to have Sam be kind of central do you think as you think about - 

00:13:20
MONICA Well, I mean... 

00:13:20
GERALD MONK - prodding. I mean it's-- it's quite difficult to keep focused on your child. 

00:13:25
MONICA Yeah. I, I'm, I'm a mom. Like that's, that's just how I see it. Once, you know, I, I held Sam in my arms I just thought I'm-- this is it. 

00:13:35
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:13:35
MONICA This is my role. 

00:13:35
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:13:35
MONICA This is my role in life. To make sure this little guy is gonna be okay. 

00:13:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:13:40
MONICA So, I mean, I'm just-- I'm focused on him, you know, even when I go to work, if I'm having a hard day or whatever. I just think, you know, this is for my son. 

00:13:50
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
MONICA And it's gonna be all right cuz this is for my son. So... 

00:13:50
GERALD MONK So, so you're really clear in terms of your own bonding right from the beginning. You also mentioned earlier that Sam has a father and in terms of his best interest, and so that you also-- in addition to that powerful bond you've named, you mentioned that there was a recognition of David's role - 

00:14:10
MONICA Yeah. 

00:14:10
GERALD MONK On an ongoing basis in caring for him. Is, ah, am I understanding that correctly? 

00:14:15
MONICA Yeah, yeah. It's just sometimes I have a little bit of trouble, uhm, accepting it - 

00:14:20
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

00:14:20
MONICA - just because of the things that have happened between us. 

00:14:20
GERALD MONK Some of-- some difficult things that have happened. 

00:14:25
MONICA Right. 

00:14:25
GERALD MONK And yet, despite the difficult things like-- if I'm not wro-- understanding this correctly, the-- there's still that recognition in you about connecting with... 

00:14:35
MONICA Yeah. 

00:14:35
GERALD MONK - Sam with his dad - 

00:14:35
MONICA Yeah. 

00:14:35
GERALD MONK - and that role. 

00:14:35
GERALD MONK David, I'm, I'm wondering, you know, how you have been able to be clear about, uhm, Sam's needs and his issues and separate from the issues that, ah, come up between the two of you. And I mean, if you had sat, had sat in my chair over the course of, of month's meeting with couples, this really is a very, very difficult issue. So I, I really am struck by that, that clarity. 

00:15:00
DAVID I think... 

00:15:00
GERALD MONK Would you mind, saying a little bit more? 

00:15:05
DAVID I think that there's, you know, a couple of things. One-- and I'm just gonna speak for myself, is that, I'm kind of just resigned to this, this marriage dissolving. 

00:15:15
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:15:15
DAVID Uhm, you know, like I said, we, we've-- we're separated once before. Uhm, and then we came back together and again, it just didn't work out. 

00:15:25
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:15:25
DAVID You know, so it was kind of the last gas if you will. 

00:15:25
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
DAVID Uhm, and the fact that we still couldn't make it work. I mean, yeah, there's, there's hurt feelings and I'm disappointed. I mean, you know, I still care about Monica. I-- but obviously we can't make it work as a couple. Uhm, so, you kinda-- I mean, again, with Sam it's, it's that he becomes the center point. I mean, you try and create an environment for this child to grow up in a healthy, you know, ah, environment. 

00:16:00
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:16:00
DAVID Uhm, so I mean, that's kind of the first and foremost that, you know, while we might-- we may have had our own disagreements and, and expectations as far as, you know, how things work out, they obviously didn't. You know, those certain kind of irreconcilable, we can't fix those. 

00:16:20
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:16:20
DAVID Uhm, but also at the same time, you know, we've seen, like I said earlier also, we've seen all these other families that just get torn apart by the divorce process. We see the effect that is has on these children and, ah, you know, the pain that it causes and that's not something that Sam needs to be drug through. 

00:16:40
GERALD MONK All right. 

00:16:40
DAVID That's not something that he needs to experience in his life, you know. We can create this tearing apart of a family, make that as, as less as painful as possible and that, that's, you know, I think that's our primary goal. At least, that's where I come from. 

00:16:55
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:16:55
DAVID So... 

00:16:55
Setting Mediation Agenda 

00:16:55
GERALD MONK All right. So we've been talking about Sam. Ah, are there other issues that, uhm, you wish to discuss in mediation? Uhm, with and-- I, I'm sensing-- I need to be guided by you about, uhm, in which things do we discuss first and, and second, uhm, there are other domains, ah, in addition to Sam and his well-being and his future with you both. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:30
MONICA Well, it's, it's tied into Sam but just, I'm, I'm concerned who Sam is gonna be around. Uhm, and when he is, uhm, here. 

00:17:45
GERALD MONK Right. So this relates to, to Sam. I'm wondering how their issues, in terms of, ah, matrimonial property of any other, uhm, other matters that couples need to negotiate. That my sense from you Monica is, uhm, you're here today. Let's talk about this particular issues with, with Sam and his well-being and his future with you both. What about you, uhm, David? 

00:18:05
DAVID Well, I think that there are, you know, ah, like the house needs to be taken cared of. 

00:18:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:18:10
DAVID All the other financial stuff that we have that also needs to be divided up, split up. 

00:18:15
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:18:15
DAVID So, yeah. 

00:18:20
GERALD MONK So ha-- sorry, go ahead. 

00:18:20
MONICA No. Cuz I just think, I mean, we, we can figure that out. 

00:18:20
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:18:20
MONICA You know, we're, we're smart people. I'm not, you know, so steadfast that, oh, I want this, or, you know, you can't have this. 

00:18:30
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:18:30
MONICA Anything like that. I just think that's gonna get taken cared of, you know. We're gonna, we're gonna be okay with that. And we, we can talk about it here. That would be great. 

00:18:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:18:45
MONICA So... 

00:18:45
GERALD MONK Do you have the same view David, regarding the other matters? 

00:18:50
DAVID Mm-hmm, yeah. 

00:18:50
GERALD MONK Okay. So... 

00:18:50
DAVID And it would be relatively, you know, pulled back from it enough to, to think logically about it and... 

00:19:00
MONICA Yeah. 

00:19:00
Understanding the Problem Saturated Story 

00:19:00
GERALD MONK Okay. Well, it's, uhm, let's continue and, and focus on your son and then, uhm, there are other, other issues you said you would, you would like to talk about the matrimonial, uhm, property issues but, you know, anticipating is gonna be a, ah, a problem but let's consider that as perhaps one of the next things we'll be doing. Uhm, so given your clarity about what you want for Sam, uhm, I'm needing to kind of understand more fully each of your perspectives on what is some of the obstacles that are getting in the way or if you're being able to work this out together. 

00:19:40
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:40
GERALD MONK And, uhm, so, uhm, David, you sort of got things started off and wondering perhaps, Monica, if we can go to you to get started on that and, uhm, just kind of explain to me your, you know, what you think, ah, the issues, the challenges and, ah, uhm, also to pick it up from there and they will come back to you David and I like to hear your perspective. Okay, just go ahead. 

00:20:05
MONICA Okay, uhm, uhm, Sam is a great little guy and he deserves all the care in the world. And so, uhm, it, it makes me sad that, you know, he has to go through this cuz it's mine. No fault of him. Ah, and his parents are splitting up but, uhm, but yeah. I, I do worry about what's gonna happen, you know, whether we're gonna be on the same track as far as parenting and things like that. Uhm, and like I did before, you know, a safety and things like that. That's a big concern of mine, - 

00:20:50
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:20:50
MONICA - uhm, because, uhm, during the process of when we're splitting up, I found out that David was getting into methamphetamines and things like that and, uhm, the person he was doing with. And she's-- I mean, she's a home wrecker so, uhm, I'm just concerned like who he's going to be hanging out with, who my son's gonna be, you know... 

00:21:15
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:21:15
MONICA Who is it with and, and things like that. And, I mean, he tells me, you know, I'm not doing that anymore, whatever. What have you, but and he was lying before and it's twice. So-- and I give him the benefit of the doubt and I was like, okay, well, let's try again and it happened again. And so I just feel like I need some back up, you know. This is my little guy like I, I-- if I don't feel he's 100% safe, then I just-- I have to take that risk of, you know, making sure he's fine and if I have to shelter him from certain situations or even holding off on him seeing his dad. If I know that's better for him, then - 

00:22:05
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

00:22:05
MONICA - I'd rather deal with that than put him in danger. So... 

00:22:10
GERALD MONK Okay, let's come back to that. What, what I'd like to catch up with you a little bit is what the arrangements are right now in terms of your care giving plan and what's happening so I get some sense of... 

00:22:20
MONICA Okay. Well, right now it's a little crazy because of everything that I found out so-- but before, uhm, when we split up for a little while I've had full custody of him and he would see him every other weekend. Uhm, and then if he called me up and said, "Hey, you know I wanna take this weekend too" or "Football game" or whatever, I'd say, "Yeah," you know. Uhm, so it was mostly weekends. 

00:22:45
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
MONICA Then, uhm, David have time so-- but, uhm, and then when we were trying to patch things up he was staying with us. So obviously that kind of-- he was seeing him every day. But now, uhm, because I'm, I am very scared of what's gonna happen to him, then it's, ah, you know, maybe once a week of dad. And so I have to have really, uhm, clear times that I'm gonna pick him up and things like that and, uhm, I know he doesn't like that but that's... 

00:23:25
GERALD MONK So you're, uhm, you're wanting to have some kind of clear plan, - 

00:23:25
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:23:30
GERALD MONK - uhm, about picking up times, dropping off times, and the pattern is being weakened. Ah, or one day, ah, one day in the weekend, ah, just... 

00:23:40
MONICA Yeah, like I said. 

00:23:40
DAVID One, one day. 

00:23:40
GERALD MONK One day in the, in the weekend. 

00:23:45
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:23:45
GERALD MONK And at the moment, it's not going that well because from your perspective, the-- it's not kind of clear arrangements about time and stuff like, and stuff like that. 

00:23:55
MONICA Right. 

00:23:55
GERALD MONK Okay. Uhm, so you've, you've-- are saying that safety is an issue that's really, ah, a great concern for you and, and Sam. And this is creating a lot of, ah, tension for you. So let, let me hear a little bit from David about his perspective on the current arrangements and I'd like to come back and hear some more from you about how you're making sense of things. 

00:24:25
MONICA Okay. 

00:24:25
GERALD MONK Is that okay? 

00:24:25
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:24:25
GERALD MONK All right. So David, catch me up with your understandings and, and what's happening from your perspective. 

00:24:35
DAVID Well, first off, you know, I'll admit, okay. Yes, I had an affair. Uhm, but calling her a home wrecker is completely unfair. I think there is a lot of things that happened that wrecked the home. 

00:24:45
GERALD MONK Well, what's her name? Who... 

00:24:45
DAVID Lisa. 

00:24:45
GERALD MONK Lisa. 

00:24:45
DAVID Yeah. 

00:24:45
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:24:45
DAVID There's a lot of things that happened to wreck the home before she ever came along so - 

00:24:50
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:24:55
DAVID - it-- I think it's completely unfair that she gets dragged into this. Also with the methamphetamine, yes. Okay, so I'll admit that again, it was twice. Did it twice. Sam wasn't around. It wasn't done in the house. It was while I was over her place. Uhm, and it was in any way. It was just, you know, having a good time. It was not as if I have a problem with it. It's not as if I'm doing it every day. It's not as if it's affecting my job, it's affecting my relationship with Sam or anything. So I think that's a little kind of blown out of proportion. Uhm, and, you know, I'm a little disappointed that she would think that it comes down to my safety that Sa-- Sam's safety would be in danger if he was with me. 

00:25:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:25:40
DAVID You know, so essentially, what she's doing is that she's, you know, cutting me off from my son because I'm involved with another woman and that she found out that I did drugs twice. It's not that big of a problem. I would never let that affect my relationship with Sam. Sam's never even met Lisa. That's not something that, you know, the relationship continued on. Maybe but not right away. It's not as if I'm gonna move in with her. I don't-- I live in my own apartment. You know, it's not as if I even see her every day. Lisa, that is. Uhm, I see, you know, Monica who I pick Sam up and drop him off which, you know, the one day a week. It's usually about four hours. I'm pretty strictly le--regulated. So, you know, again, it's not as if I'm intentionally trying to harm Sam, you know. He's my son, I love him. I'm going to do what I need to do as a father to support and raise my child. But, you know, the fact that our relationship didn't work out doesn't necessarily mean that it should affect my relationship with my son. 

00:26:55
GERALD MONK Okay. I guess I need to understand, ah, then what discussions you had about how the arrangements will go for Sam. You've talked about a four hour period, picking up and dropping off. It seems like the way you're talking about that, you're pretty dissatisfied - 

00:27:15
DAVID Hmm. 

00:27:15
GERALD MONK - with how much time you're seeing Sam. So how about you say a little bit more about what would work, ah, in a way that you think would be in Sam's best interests in having connections with you. What, what are your thoughts? 

00:27:30
DAVID You know, we, we were separated before. And during that we, ah, a parental agreement or separation agreement. Is that what it was called? 

00:27:40
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
DAVID Ah, anyway, uhm, and I've had him on the weekends at least, you know, every other weekend and that if things didn't work out or if she had to go out of town on a business trip or she was gonna go see her family, who or whatever then. You know, I would, I would take him and that seem to be working out pretty well. Uhm, now, you know, I'd, I'd, I'd be-- If we're able to have that situation happen again cuz it seems like it worked out. Uhm, but right now, it just seems like that's not even on the table, you know. That if we were going to go with, you know, lawyers and kind of go that route that, you know, she might be going for full custody and I don't want that to happen. 

00:28:25
GERALD MONK So what's the ideal figure in terms of the time you have with Sam. 

00:28:30
DAVID Weekends. 

00:28:30
GERALD MONK Every weekend. 

00:28:30
DAVID Weekends, maybe a couple of nights, you know. Maybe go to a baseball game, go to a football game. That kind of a thing. 

00:28:35
GERALD MONK Okay. Okay, uhm, so yeah. So what are your thoughts, uhm, Monica, about how this plan might look for Sam and his well-being and his best interest? 

00:28:50
MONICA Well, I mean, that's fine, like I said. I want David to be present in Sam's life but I need some sense of security - 

00:29:00
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:29:00
MONICA - to know that he's gonna be okay. So, uhm... 

00:29:05
DAVID And me telling you that isn't enough. 

00:29:05
MONICA No, I'm sorry. It's not. 

00:29:05
GERALD MONK What would happen right, - 

00:29:05
MONICA But... 

00:29:10
GERALD MONK - right now if you started talking together and seeing how far you, you, you got in collaborating together about what, uhm, arrangements you like to have for Sam. You feel that, that you, uhm, might be able to make a little progress right now talking together with me present. 

00:29:30
MONICA Well, we've kind of tried to but-- I've been asking him to, to drug tests and that to me would be, you know, a step forward into me feeling a sense of security. I mean, he's the one who kind of stepped out of line, so obviously I think I would need some type of reassurance, you know, to know that everything's gonna be okay now. And every time I bring it up, like, it's like I'm asking for some preposterous things. Something way out of line and... 

00:30:00
DAVID It is. I did it twice. 

00:30:00
MONICA But I don't know that. 

00:30:05
DAVID Twice. 

00:30:05
MONICA I don't know that. 

00:30:05
DAVID Well, do tell me about it. 

00:30:10
MONICA But... 

00:30:10
DAVID I mean, if I were gonna lie about it I would say that I didn't do it at all. But I admit twice. 

00:30:20
MONICA Well, that's fine and dandy but I already told you what I mean, so... 

00:30:20
GERALD MONK So what, what are the issues then is, ah, is distrust. Ah, given these, uhm, occasions that David reported. 

00:30:30
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:30
GERALD MONK Uhm, has-- you really wanting something from him in terms of some kind of reassurance. 

00:30:40
MONICA Yeah. 

00:30:40
GERALD MONK Uhm, so, uhm, this seems to be getting in the way of you moving forward. 

00:30:45
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:45
DAVID I mean, it's almost like... 

00:30:45
GERALD MONK Issues, issues of trust. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:50
DAVID You know, she's still-- the relationship didn't work out and yet, she's trying to control what I do outside of the relationship. But I'm telling her that when I have Sam, you know, there's not gonna be drug paraphernalia on the house and whose to say I'm even gonna do it again? I don't know if I'm ever gonna do it again. It's not if I have plans that after we get done here for instance, I'm gonna go and, you know, smoke it. But, you know, I'm not gonna say it's not gonna happen but I can promise you, I can guarantee you. And I've said this over and over, it would not happen when Sam is around. Or if I were to see Sam that day, I would not do it that morning or the night before. 

00:31:30
GERALD MONK Have you had the experience in the past of David talking to you and reassuring you about certain things that, ah, ought to do with, uhm, Sam and his well-being or other matters that have been helpful in terms of building trust given some of the challenging things you've obviously been through? 

00:31:55
MONICA Hmm. All right. That's kind of hard to answer because-- I mean, there's other situation part of why we split up was that, you know, I didn't feel he was kind of pulling his end of the bargain with bills and things like that which is another thing that I trusted him with. And making sure bills got paid and... 

00:32:20
DAVID Which you also knew about before - 

00:32:20
MONICA House bills. 

00:32:20
DAVID - we ever even got married. 

00:32:20
MONICA But I took care of my job as a wife. You know, I always made sure house was nice and clean and I mean, not super spick and span like white glove type of thing but, you know, the house was clean and I always had dinner, I always had food. Uhm, Sam's always been taken cared of and everything like that. So, uhm, I guess I assumed that David was doing the same thing, you know, with bills and things that as a husband, he should have been doing. But, uhm, but I couldn't address him with that too. So it's like, what? Give me some, something, ah, you know, to hold on to here. I need to make sure everything's gonna be okay, so... 

00:33:10
GERALD MONK So distrust is really getting in the way of going forward with a plan that would be smooth and something that you both could support that Samuel would-- Sam would benefit from, uhm, and you're identifying. You've got at the moment, some ideas about how that could be addressed. 

00:33:30
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:33:30
GERALD MONK Uhm, how about from your perspective. Though, what-- from what you think is some of the obstacles that are getting in the way for just you just moving forward and making it somebody to transition. 

00:33:45
DAVID Can I respond to what she said though? I feel like, you know, I was just kind of attacked a little bit and I'd like to, you know, again. 

00:33:55
GERALD MONK Okay, go ahead. 

00:33:55
DAVID I think that, uhm, this is something that she knew about before we got married, before Sammy came along. 

00:34:05
GERALD MONK Oh, you're talking about the matters to do with the finances. 

00:34:05
DAVID Yeah. 

00:34:05
GERALD MONK And, uhm, so what you're wanting to do is sort of put-- give you side of the story regarding that side of your relationship. 

00:34:15
DAVID Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know. I mean, I lived on my own during college and was able to pay the bills and everything was fine. I mean, yes, I might have paid the bill late here or there. Uhm, but never, you know, never had the power turned off, never lost the phone, you know, and everything was always paid for. Uhm, and now, I spent a lot of my time worrying about other people's money. That, that is my primary focus, that I'm thinking about their money. That's how I make money. Uhm, so then, my own finances take a backseat but it's not as if, you know, at any point in time during our marriage that we were ever in danger of being bankrupt or ever in danger of being out in the streets. So I think that's kind of a little, a little over the top. I think that's a little-- I mean, I, I don't... 

00:35:00
MONICA No, it's not because, why? Why not just pay the bill sometimes? 

00:35:05
DAVID Cuz I have other things on my mind. Like, I wanna spend time with my family when I come home from work. 

00:35:10
MONICA You can. You just pay the bills first. I mean, I found a way to spend time with our family. I found a way to, you know, read to Sam and play with him and watch movies with him. 

00:35:20
GERALD MONK So not... 

00:35:20
MONICA I was there with you. 

00:35:20
GERALD MONK Not paying... 

00:35:25
MONICA But I took care of my stuff. 

00:35:25
DAVID That was-- it was one of those-- it was always one of those things that I mean, you knew that this was side of me before we got married. I mean, you knew. So all of a sudden we get married and the changes - 

00:35:30
MONICA But it's for... 

00:35:35
DAVID - that I have to be. 

00:35:35
MONICA No, no, no. But it's your job. Your job is to make sure everyone's kind of on top of finances and on-- how come we haven't do that at home? 

00:35:45
DAVID Because it's my job. I want my job to be in my job. I don't want my home to be my job too. 

00:35:50
GERALD MONK So, uhm, Monica, you were pointing out that the way you, you kind of divided up roles in the house was you were kind of looking after domestic, uhm, aspects, cooking the meals and looking after the house. 

00:36:00
MONICA Right. 

00:36:00
GERALD MONK And you felt that was the, the contract was that David would look after the finances and paying attention to all of those things. 

00:36:10
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:36:10
GERALD MONK Uhm, you're pointing out that distrust grew when you discovered that bills were paid late. You're pointing out that nothing terrible happened because if your bills were paid late it was that your well-being as a couple, ah, as a family were not jeopardized, just like-- I guess what you're saying. 

00:36:30
DAVID Well, and things just change. I mean, the rigid Monica that is here now what not the same person that I started dating in college. It was not the same person that, you know, I married. I mean, something happened where, yeah, just a little bit-- she's more inflexible about things, you know. She's not as fun. She just can just relax, can't just, you know, take things easy and, you know, and it's always a stress, there's always a problem, there's always something that's going on that's, in my opinion, that's kind of blown out of proportion and all that. 

00:37:05
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:37:05
DAVID You know, that doesn't necessarily need to be this huge mountain to climb over. 

00:37:10
GERALD MONK Well, let me come, let me come back to my question which was what from your perspective, is the obstacle to having a somewhat smooth transition for Sam and coming together as parents to work out things for him? 

00:37:30
DAVID For distrust of me. 

00:37:30
GERALD MONK You agree that distrust also is impacting the whole situation? 

00:37:35
DAVID Well, you know, I mean, you make a few choices and then - 

00:37:40
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:37:40
DAVID - you just get labeled that you're responsible and you can't ever be good enough. 

00:37:45
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:37:45
DAVID You know, so basically she's cut the legs out from underneath me - 

00:37:45
GERALD MONK All right. 

00:37:50
DAVID - as far as my role as a father. 

00:37:50
Externalizing and Mapping the Effects 

00:37:50
GERALD MONK Excuse me. I'm wondering, uhm, then trying to understand this more. The, uhm, what the effect of distrust had been on each of you and how it gets in the way of making some kind of forward moving plans for your side. Uhm, can you, can you help me un-- understand more fully about the effects of distrust, uhm, on, on you and, uhm, and Sam and how you kind of think about this whole thing. Wha-- wha-- what are some of the effects or some of the consequences of this? 

00:38:25
MONICA Well, I mean, when I first found out that, uhm, David was seeing someone else, that really hurt me. Uhm, and I mean, I'm over it now but just I know that that's when I first-- I just-- it kinda hit me like I'm, I'm on my own, you know. I'm on my own with this. 

00:38:50
GERALD MONK What, what? 

00:38:50
MONICA I have to, I have to make sure-- like I just felt kind of like I have to make sure everything is taken cared of. It get-- it's up to me. 

00:39:00
GERALD MONK All right. Ah, you mentioned this is a huge issue of discovering what happen with David and, and Lisa. Is that correct? Ah, help me understand what fully the effects of that on you because that it, it's really part of this conversation ra-- given what we've already talked about. Well, what were the effects? What ta-- help me understand fully what it was like and what you went through regarding that. 

00:39:30
MONICA Well, I mean, it is kinda one of those things that I know it happens. I know a lot of husbands cheat on their wives and all that stuff. But this... 

00:39:40
GERALD MONK Some people call this betrayal. Is it, is it - 

00:39:45
MONICA Yeah. 

00:39:45
GERALD MONK Is that a word that fits or - 

00:39:45
MONICA Yeah. 

00:39:45
GERALD MONK - some other words that you would use? 

00:39:50
MONICA Yeah, it's like a slap in the face. 

00:39:50
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:39:50
MONICA You know, here I am, really trying to work hard, you know, to be, to be a wife, to, you know, have a nice home to, uhm, raise our child and here we're going to parties and, you know, holding hands and smiling and then oh, ah, this whole time there's been another woman. 

00:40:15
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:40:15
MONICA And you're doing drugs with her and it's like, wha-- It's yeah, just literally a slap in the face. 

00:40:20
GERALD MONK Kind of shocking. It's sort of... 

00:40:20
MONICA Yeah, shocking. 

00:40:25
GERALD MONK Yeah, and, and... 

00:40:25
MONICA To me, you know, it, it was just all around shock, you know. Cuz my mom, she's a traditional Mexican woman, you know, and she, she actually prepared me for it and I thought, nah. Mom, you got nothing to worry about, you know. That doesn't happen, that's not gonna happen to us, you know. We've known each other for so long and, and then it happens. And then people find out and then-- so it just... 

00:40:55
GERALD MONK And then what happened? Like, well, people started talking about it and then it created a whole set of other consequences for you so... 

00:41:05
MONICA And so at that point I just thought like, well, you know what? Really, whatever. You know, whatever people think, that's fine, that's on them. Whatever. You know, less... 

00:41:15
GERALD MONK You feel like, people are being-- making judgments about you and your part in this. 

00:41:20
MONICA Oh, yeah. And I know it happens. I mean, like we talked about before we have-- well, now we only talk to Claudia but we, uhm, we have really close friends, Claudia and Kevin. We hung out a lot and they end up going through a divorce and Claudia actually ended up staying with us. So I just figured with that, you know, and us seen witnessing all the drama, all the nastiness that went around that. You know, what would you want to put your family through that? Like, I just-- I don't get it. So... 

00:41:55
GERALD MONK It strikes me, you're still stinging from this. It was a little while ago. How long ago was it actually? 

00:42:05
MONICA Well, the first time it happ... 

00:42:05
GERALD MONK We're talking about a couple of months ago or... 

00:42:05
MONICA The, the first time we split up? 

00:42:10
GERALD MONK With Li-- with Lisa and you're discovering this, this slap in the face. 

00:42:10
MONICA Right, right. 

00:42:10
GERALD MONK When, when are you referring to? 

00:42:15
MONICA That happened about a year ago? Was that a year ago? When I, I first found out about it. 

00:42:20
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:42:20
MONICA So we had this big blow out and whatever, what have you. 

00:42:20
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:42:20
MONICA And, and then a few months passed and we decided, okay, well, let's give it a try. And I talked to him and, you know, ah, my mom was telling me make it work, you know, make it work. And I, I didn't want to but then I thought, well, you know, what? He deserves a chance. 

00:42:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:42:45
MONICA All has been to do this so I guess might as well give him a chance. So I tried, you know, I tried to make it work. We talked and he said, I'm gonna end up with her and, you know, this wonderful, you know, I'm gonna do everything it takes, attitude was coming from him so it's like, okay, perfect. Let's do this. And, and then it happened again. And... 

00:43:10
GERALD MONK And then what happened to you as a result. What was the effect of the second time? 

00:43:15
MONICA I was just like, okay, that's it, it's done. I'm not gonna be made a fool of, you know. 

00:43:20
GERALD MONK You felt humiliated. 

00:43:20
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:43:20
GERALD MONK What I'm understanding for you, there has been this period of, uhm, betrayal or this slap in the face experience that went on. Then when people spoke about it and your mom gave you instructions about how-- what to do and, and then it occurred again and what-- these are my words but it seemed like there was some kind of shame or humiliation that impacted you given all your efforts, - 

00:43:45
MONICA Right. 

00:43:45
GERALD MONK - ah, to try and make it work. So, we've had this series of events for you which has lead you right now to be struggling to be trusting of David enough to allow Sam to be able to visit more frequently and to get to some kind of arrangement where he can spend more time with his, with his dad. 

00:44:15
MONICA Yeah. 

00:44:15
GERALD MONK Correct? 

00:44:15
MONICA Yeah. And, and see, that's a thing too. Like, I don't wanna be made out. I don't want to be like this wicked witch of the East or whatever she's from. 

00:44:25
GERALD MONK From the north of the south. 

00:44:25
MONICA From the north or wherever. But, you know, cuz I want him to be with his dad but it's really hard. It's just hard. So it, it's, it's not like I'm trying to take him away from you. You know that. But I just... 

00:44:45
GERALD MONK When you say it's hard, perhaps some other words that you described, what it is for you right now. Cuz I wanna understand the obstacles that keep kind of getting in the way of you being able to go to the next stage where sha-- I really understand as wanting to be more trusting. 

00:45:00
MONICA Yeah. 

00:45:00
GERALD MONK Thus, you've got an idea about how to resolve that. 

00:45:00
MONICA Yeah, that's, that's what it is. 

00:45:00
GERALD MONK But, but, ah, I wanna just talk, get a bit of sense of-- to understand the dynamics to support you and your ultimate agenda. That's why I'm kind of pursuing this a little more just to get a bit of sense from your perspective - 

00:45:15
MONICA Right. 

00:45:15
GERALD MONK - about that. So then right now, what are the issues for you in terms of that history of the last year? It's-- are you in a state of, uhm, numbness, shock, disbelief. Uhm, what, what is, what is it that's happening right now as you think about when you wanna have Sam spend more time with his dad you just kind of go there. 

00:45:40
MONICA Mmm, it's, it's not numbness. I know what's going on. I-- it's a very real struggle within me - 

00:45:50
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:45:50
MONICA - and that's how I feel it. Like, it's like 50-50. 

00:45:50
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:45:50
MONICA Like you have to protect your son. 

00:45:55
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:45:55
MONICA You're, you're the mom. 

00:45:55
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:45:55
MONICA But then... 

00:45:55
GERALD MONK So this protection and, and wanting to - 

00:46:00
MONICA Yeah. It just feels like a very... 

00:46:00
GERALD MONK - ensure that Sam is gonna be safe and that on the one hand. What's on the other hand? 

00:46:05
MONICA On the other hand is, here's my child telling me, "Mommy, when am I gonna see daddy?" You know? Uhm, is daddy gonna take me to football practices, you know? 

00:46:15
GERALD MONK So when he says that, how does that affect you? 

00:46:15
MONICA It, it makes me really, really sad. 

00:46:20
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:46:20
MONICA I'm sad so. It just makes me realize that I can't do everything for him by myself. And the person that I wanted to do that with, I can trust. So, yeah. 

00:46:40
GERALD MONK All right. So, David, you've been sitting there for quite a while listening to quite a conversation that we've been having. What are you reacting to what we've been talking about. What is your experience? What are you thinking about these issues and so I can understand your perspective on this? 

00:46:55
DAVID I mean, it's making me up to be a dick. And I'll admit that I didn't do things the right way. That things probably could have been handled a little bit better. 

00:47:10
GERALD MONK You messed up. 

00:47:10
DAVID I did. 

00:47:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:47:10
DAVID Well, yeah, things could have been handled better. 

00:47:15
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:47:15
DAVID I won't quite say I messed up. I mean, things with our relationship but not then, as good as then could have been for a long, long time. Uhm, you know... 

00:47:25
GERALD MONK Things were not what you'd hope for when you came back together in terms of reconnecting. It didn't unfold the way you were hoping it would. Ah, you and Monica. 

00:47:35
DAVID No. I mean, that's, you know, we had talked about it. We had talked about what had gone on the first time and, you know, I thought that things then understood and it immediately went right back to it. And for anything else, it was a little bit worse. I mean, again, I think that's really when the distrust started to happen. Like when she couldn't trust me anymore is because, you know, I had this affair. I told her I'd stop it and that I come back in the house and it's, you know, like living in a concentration camp, you know, behind barbed wire fences. There's no trust, there's no weight around this, there's no anything. Uhm, you know, I was not... 

00:48:05
GERALD MONK So distrust was really big - 

00:48:10
DAVID Yeah. 

00:48:10
GERALD MONK - when you came back from your perspective and that kinda got in the way of kinda reconnecting again. Is that, is that your - 

00:48:20
DAVID Right. 

00:48:20
GERALD MONK - what you're saying? 

00:48:20
DAVID Right, right. And so I went back to Lisa cuz she was able to give me that kind of emotional attachment that, you know. 

00:48:30
MONICA Right, cuz she's not a home wrecker. 

00:48:35
DAVID No, like I said, there was things that happened in our relationship before she ever came along that did a lot to wreck our home as-- than anything she did. 

00:48:45
GERALD MONK All right, so here you are at this point. You're-- you've described a series of experiences that have been very painful and for you, you've acknowledged that you could have handled some things better. But really, for you distrust was so bad, uhm, in the home and how Monica felt about you that it really-- you felt like it didn't really give you much of a chance to get started. So now, distrust looms like a big shadow over the two of you and stopping you being able to see Sam and having the time you want with him and to build-- keep building those connections. And it creates for you this kind of-- you kind of did this with your hands. Like, ah, this kind of-- I forgot the words you used but this-- it, it-- I kind of feel like a sort of tortured kind of experience from the one hand and hearing Sam, what he's wanting to do and feeling really, really sad. And seeing that, you know, that could be resolved by Sam having those experiences and yet on the other hand, kind of protection is there. 

00:49:50
Evaluating Preferences and Exploring Future Directions 

00:49:50
GERALD MONK So here you are at this point and I'm not in charge of what decisions you're gonna make or what processes you will use. You've got some ideas. I think quite definite ideas about how this could be resolved. You're response to that is one where that is not acceptable. You see that as kind of an intrusion on your life. Kind of, some kind of violation and, uhm, so what do you do to maintain as-- to have a sense of collaboration, a sense of the best interest for Sam at this point. Like, I'm not-- I, I'm not sure what I could offer you or suggest to you. I'm really asking you what do you do at this point? 

00:50:40
MONICA Ah, I think I've already... 

00:50:45
GERALD MONK You've come up with your, - 

00:50:45
MONICA Yeah. 

00:50:45
GERALD MONK - your best shot. 

00:50:45
MONICA And I want to, like I want him to take him more. I think that would be great, you know. 

00:50:50
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
MONICA I think that's enough time. 

00:50:50
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
MONICA They would go to games together all the time and I'm not opposed to that at all, you know? 

00:50:55
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:51:00
MONICA And I-- it's like-- and it would help me out too. I mean, I'm not gonna lie and say, "Oh, I'm not, you know." 

00:51:05
GERALD MONK Do you-- are you finally getting some, some wise advice and counsel from the people that know you to help you manage the distrust issue? Is this, uhm, cuz often times in situations like that people talk with their family, their friends for advice. What do I do? Like I want to, uhm, protect Sam but I also want to not be sad by cutting him off his, his dad. And I'm just wondering what resources you're having to assist you to, uhm, make the next step. 

00:51:40
MONICA Well, I mean, talk to my mom and my sister all the time. My sisters, then happily married for about 10 years. 

00:51:45
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

00:51:45
MONICA The have a couple of kids together - 

00:51:50
GERALD MONK She's giving you some advice? 

00:51:50
MONICA - and so, she's giving me some advice. 

00:51:50
GERALD MONK What's her advice? 

00:51:50
MONICA Her advice is what I've been saying. Like, make it work. The faster you guys make it work the more okay Sam's going to be with, the more he's gonna start to get used to it. 

00:52:00
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:52:00
MONICA You know, just make it work. And so I want to make it work, you know. But-- and I don't think I'm asking for too much. 

00:52:10
GERALD MONK So what's invo-- wha-- what have they just given you? Some detailed advice about the drug test, how this is to happen? What, what's-- how does it look as an option. 

00:52:20
MONICA Well, the drug test was more kinda like my mom. Well, my thing too, uhm, because-- I mean, we don't-- we're not into that at all, you know. Uhm, so I tol-- when she found out. I mean, she even got worried for Sam. She was like, you know, I don't want my grandchild around that kind of stuff and things like that. You know, here we are working so hard to protect him and - 

00:52:45
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:52:45
MONICA - you know, now what do we do? So... 

00:52:45
GERALD MONK So let's imagine that David did have this test that you're proposing. 

00:52:50
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:52:55
GERALD MONK And he was, uhm, there was no drugs in his system of the kind that are creating these problems or, uhm, people are made up of a lot of chemicals but there's particular chemicals you're concerned about. What, uhm, what might happen then if this was done? 

00:53:15
MONICA If that happens? Well, I, you know, I'd be willing to really work something out on - 

00:53:20
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:53:20
MONICA - paper and say, "All right, this is how its gonna go, you know." You pick him up on weekends or even whatever after school and we'll try it out and if it works out, then let's continue doing that. 

00:53:30
GERALD MONK So is a drug test the quickest way to trust? 

00:53:35
MONICA For me? Yes. 

00:53:35
GERALD MONK Yes. This is your - 

00:53:40
MONICA Right now. 

00:53:40
GERALD MONK - fast track. 

00:53:40
MONICA Right now, yes. Because like I said, I want to... 

00:53:40
GERALD MONK All right. 

00:53:45
MONICA Ah, you know. 

00:53:45
Scaling Question 

00:53:45
GERALD MONK So, but with these things, it's never all or nothing completely. Like, let's say for example, uhm, distrust, uhm, was a percentage of, of how much distress you had and some, ah, let's say that, uhm, on one end of the continuum someone was completely and utterly distrusting of everything. - 

00:54:05
MONICA Mmm. 

00:54:05
GERALD MONK - ah, of the other person. And clearly that's not the case because you're considering really wanting - 

00:54:10
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

00:54:15
GERALD MONK - to have, uhm, David have this time. So you obviously give some trust. And zero was complete and utter trust so that you were completely, uhm, absolutely fine with hesitation. What, what would you rate yourself right now in terms of the level of distrust that's keeping you kind of in the mode that you're in with Sam. 

00:54:35
MONICA So zero was, uhm... 

00:54:35
GERALD MONK Zero is trust, trust. 

00:54:35
MONICA Oh, trust. 

00:54:35
GERALD MONK Zero is trust. Zero is no distrust present at all and a hundred percent is complete and utter distrust. No trust whatsoever. You wouldn't be letting Sam near David and under any circumstance of distrust had got to the point where it was a hundred percent. What would it be right now? 

00:54:55
MONICA Uhm, it would be more towards a little more trust but not - 

00:55:00
GERALD MONK Fifty percent. 

00:55:00
MONICA - not too much. 

00:55:05
GERALD MONK Sixty percent distrust? 

00:55:05
MONICA Sixty percent distrust. 

00:55:10
GERALD MONK I don't wanna be making this up for you - 

00:55:10
MONICA Yeah, I know. 

00:55:10
GERALD MONK - more or less. 

00:55:10
MONICA Because I, I am and - 

00:55:15
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:55:15
MONICA - and, you know, yeah, I guess. I would happen to have some assurance as to not just drug tests. Like I would have to know that. I mean, obviously Lisa becomes part of your life. We're gonna have to deal with that later but right now, - 

00:55:30
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:55:30
MONICA - like, I don't want my son saying, "Oh, daddy was saying kissing on this girl. Who's that?" Blah, blah, blah. Like, that's just-- I don't think he needs to go through that so I need that assurance too. 

00:55:40
Scaffolding the Alternative Story 

00:55:40
GERALD MONK Okay. So there's a number of things. It's not just that particular issue but we've got a lot to work with because what I'm curious about is that there is still trust despite its strength of distrust. There's still something and I'd like to be interes-- I'd like to know about that, what you can build on cuz I'm wanting to support you with your agenda. I think you both are very much one of us. 

00:56:00
MONICA Wa... 

00:56:00
GERALD MONK Uhm, so what we've been talking about is, uhm, finding ways of growing trust and, ah, it's clear that there is some trust or you identified that there is some trust although we haven't really talked about what is going on that enables you to have some of it but you also recognize that the issues with Lisa are going to perhaps come into play with how this is going to affect Sam and so on which we haven't got time, right? You know, to go into but I wanted to come back to you David and, uhm, as you're being following, I'm sure, that we're, we're talking about trying to grow trust as a way of being able to move things along and there are some things getting in the way. What, uhm, ideas do you have or what you're, what is your perspective, uhm, in terms of how to go forward regarding this matter. 

00:56:55
[sil.] 

00:57:00
DAVID I just think it's-- I don't want to be essentially peeing in a cup once a week for the rest of my life. 

00:57:05
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

00:57:10
DAVID You know, I, I understand she's hurt but you-- I get that. Uhm, but I also think that this, you know, drug user, drug addict is blown out of proportion. And that's the thing that I find the hardest to, to reconcile, to deal with. Uhm, you know, we were never in any danger of being on the street. You know, my activities never hurt our family in any way and they wouldn't now. And as far as Sam, seeing if it was Lisa or anybody else coming over and date, I mean this, I mean this is what it comes down to if you like. There's almost this, still, you know, I'm gonna dictate your life even though we're not gonna be together anymore. 

00:57:55
GERALD MONK Right. 

00:57:55
DAVID And, you know, so I don't want to quote her, you know, "I don't want my son to see him kissing to be like, oh, I saw him kissing on some woman." You know, I think at some point in time, if chances are good, he's gonna see her kissing on some man. 

00:58:10
GERALD MONK So the issue with, uhm, with Lisa is a whole another, uhm, issue we haven't even really begun to talk about. 

00:58:15
DAVID Mm-hmm. 

00:58:15
GERALD MONK Ah, what we-- what you had-- were identifying is this, this drug te-- that if there was a drug test, then your trust would increase and therefore, things would open up and just be very straight forward. You've said I'm not wanting to be peeing in a cup for every week. I mean, what ideas did you have about this drug test? Would it be some ongoing or like a one off thing or... 

00:58:40
MONICA Like, when I was first asking for it, it was a while back so I just kinda wanted to make sure. Like, okay, no, really. It didn't stop this time around. Something else other than just his word because I've gotten his word before. 

00:58:55
GERALD MONK Okay. 

00:58:55
MONICA So I haven't really thought about, like, oh, is this gonna-- it, it wouldn't be once a week. Like, I would never, I wouldn't want that from me so I, I wouldn't be once a week but... 

00:59:05
GERALD MONK You're looking for some sign - 

00:59:10
MONICA Yeah. 

00:59:10
GERALD MONK - to support, uhm, David's weight of promise about what he's gonna be doing and not gonna be harming, - 

00:59:15
MONICA Right, and then him saying not... 

00:59:15
GERALD MONK - uhm, Sam. 

00:59:20
MONICA - that he didn't want to do it doesn't help my... 

00:59:20
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm, right. 

00:59:20
MONICA You know, - 

00:59:20
GERALD MONK I und-- yes, I understand. 

00:59:25
MONICA - his word. 

00:59:25
GERALD MONK Uhm, so but what you've said all along in this interview is, uhm, I'm wanting Sam to be safe, I'm wanting to care for my son. I don't wanna be put in a situation. I'm not gonna be doing drugs of any kind when I'm caring for Sam. So that's what you're, you're clear about. What you're wanting. You-- the, the distrust is affecting you in terms of how much you can join that. So I, I just want to come back again. What-- so what ideas then do you have that might grow trust and love to make some kind of step towards Sam's future? 

01:00:05
[sil.] 

01:00:10
DAVID I don't know. I've been his father. I think that should be trust enough. I'm not just some stranger. 

01:00:25
[sil.] 

01:00:30
DAVID I mean, so as far as like, small steps to take to gain her trust... 

01:00:35
[sil.] 

01:00:40
DAVID I don't know. I mean... 

01:00:45
GERALD MONK What would help you to know? 

01:00:45
DAVID My concern is just that it's just, you know, my concern is that it won't just be this one thing that will be another thing, that will be another thing, that will be another thing. 

01:00:55
GERALD MONK So you're, you're awa-- aware that talking about this aspect, the methamphetamines issue by itself isn't gonna solve this cuz it's gonna be then the issue with Lisa and, and maybe other things. So you're wanting, ah, well, ah, you're wanting then to include-- this is a wider conversation about some of the other issues as well rather than trying to deal with this one in peace at this point. 

01:01:20
DAVID I think those play about coming out. 

01:01:20
GERALD MONK Okay, okay. 

01:01:20
DAVID Definitely. 

01:01:25
GERALD MONK This-- we have to finish now. This is my proposal to you. I-- you are both very, very clear that you're wanting to be, uhm, working together and collaborate for the sake of a good relationship for Sam with you both. That's clear. You're both aware that distrust has really crippled your efforts to come up with some kind of care giving plan that's gonna be really satisfying to your son. And you got some examples about that. And you're both interested in growing trust enough to resolve that conflict that you have so that you're feeling that he's protected enough. That you're, you're interested in wanting to grow trust. You've gotten a specific idea about one thing although it's apparent that there is some other issues as well that are gonna be played out in particular. Lisa and her role with Sam being present. That's something we haven't really had a chance to talk about. And you're not sure you want-- you would like Monica to say, look, give me another chance, I'm not gonna be harming our son. Yes, I have at times, not made some wise decisions. You're kind of-- because I'm his father, I want you to trust me for that reason. And apart from that, you're not quite sure what ideas you have about growing trust. What I would like to suggest is that we meet again in a week and we talk together about, uhm, this particular domain cuz there is some urgency, I would imagine for him when he's talking with you like he is about wanting to see his dad. And, uhm, and think about some possibilities that might help you move, uhm, around this obstacle enough to be able to make some kind of connection and how trust from your perspective could increase on both sides to figure out a way forward and to talk about the other wider issues. Uhm, how does that sound to you as a place to finish right now. Do you think I've understood the issues enough for us to kind of build on it for next week? 

01:03:40
DAVID Yeah. 

01:03:40
MONICA Yeah. It's over. 

01:03:45
GERALD MONK Are you both feeling understood by me in terms of what you've laid out? 

01:03:50
MONICA I am. 

01:03:50
GERALD MONK You are? How about you David? 

01:03:50
DAVID Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely. 

01:03:50
GERALD MONK Okay, good. All right. Well, let's make another appointment and I'll see you next week. 

01:03:55
DAVID Okay. 

01:04:00
GERALD MONK Thank you. 

01:04:00
MONICA Thank you.

01:05:00
GERALD MONK It's good to see you again Monica and David. We were planning to meet a week after, ah, we met last time but I understand, uhm, it was a posmo-- a postponement. Uhm, I think you may have called out mediation services Monica, - 

01:05:15
MONICA Yeah. 

01:05:15
GERALD MONK - scheduled another. Before we get into, uhm, some of the things we wanna talk about today and issues to do with Sam, I am wanting to kind of check up with both of you about how Sam's doing and how things have been for him with you both, ah, since we met last. Who would like to start? 

01:05:35
MONICA Well, uhm, just with, ah, not coming in last week, Sam was actually a little sick and, you know and you told me there is some-- that's why I think I going to comment some. 

01:05:45
GERALD MONK Ah, did he have a cold or... 

01:05:50
MONICA Yeah, just, ah, people to change the weather and everything. He just wasn't feeling good. 

01:05:55
GERALD MONK Ho-- how's he doing now? 

01:05:55
MONICA He's doing good. He's doing good. 

01:05:55
GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:06:00
MONICA He was fine. It was like two, two day thing. He's fine now, yeah. 

01:06:05
GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:06:05
MONICA He's-- lively little kid so, yeah. 

01:06:10
GERALD MONK Good. So, uhm, have things have been in terms of the two of you, uhm, working together with Sam, having time with you both and I guess kind of really-- like a catch up about how things have gone. Uhm, David, how about you catch me up with what's been happening. 

01:06:25
DAVID Uhm, ah, they've done about the same. I guess, maybe, well-- yeah, about the same as the last session we had. Uhm, you know, ah, I'm still-- I'm still able to see him and I'm still able to take him out. Uhm, and, you know, we, we pretty much were together to try and figure out who's gonna pick him up when and how things go, you know. Things are usually planned out beforehand so it's not, you know, surprised. 

01:07:00
GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:07:00
DAVID Tonight's the night. It's Friday. I wanted-- yeah, we don't, like, you know, understand that. Right now, she's a primary caregiver, you know. She needs to know kind of beforehand what's going on so I get it. 

01:07:10
GERALD MONK One of the things I found helpful in, in meeting your goals of collaborating together which is what you identified last time, building credit trust and coming up with a workable plan for Sam to be able to be with you both and in a way that's great for him and works for each of you, ah, is to focus on the things that are working okay. Not necessarily great but anything at all that's going okay. And, uhm, you mentioned, David, uhm, that, ah, there have been times where you've worked together about, uhm, picking up and just having that time. Would you mind, ah, if we spent a little bit of time just kinda talking in detail about how those picking up and dropping off times have gone for each of you and how it's been for Sam. 

01:08:00
DAVID Well, I think that, you know, I do have to plan things out. It's never spontaneous, you know. I can never just go and see my son. I do actually have to call a couple-- I mean, so you know the communication is good and I know that that's there. That there's that expectation but on the same time, I feel limited in the fact that I can't just be spontaneous and go and pick up my son, you know. There has to be this agenda and kind of, uhm, you know, what we're gonna do, how we're gonna do it, what time, what day, when will he be back, all that kind of, you know. Essentially knowing every little detail. 

01:08:40
GERALD MONK Okay, you mentioned, uhm, there is though some good communication despite the fact that things are way more structured and, and, uhm, organized than, than you would like. What, what is working well in terms of the, the good communication - 

01:09:00
DAVID Well, I mean... 

01:09:00
GERALD MONK between each of you. 

01:09:00
DAVID It's like we said last session. I mean, I think our primary goal is to, you know, have a healthy relationship with. We're have-- yeah, have a healthy relationship with Sam and for him to have a healthy relationship with us to be both, you know. I mean, it sucks that this relationship didn't work out but that's the way the cookie crumbles. It didn't, so I guess it's trying to make the best out of the bad thing. 

01:09:30
GERALD MONK What, what are some of the things that Monica is doing that are making the best out of the bad thing as far as you're concerned? 

01:09:40
[sil.] 

01:09:45
DAVID That's a good question. I'll think of that. 

01:09:50
GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:09:50
MONICA Really? It's that bad? 

01:09:55
GERALD MONK I'd be surprised if it works. 

01:09:55
DAVID No, it's good. It's just that, you know, there's still kind of this lack of freedom. 

01:10:00
GERALD MONK Right, you're very in touch and that fits with what you said last week about, uhm, actually a couple of weeks back about someone who likes to kind of be laid back and to be able to have a sort of a free kind of wheeling situation. 

01:10:15
DAVID Yeah. 

01:10:15
GERALD MONK My experience with people like-- at the stage, ah, where couples are, when they're separating, that most couples need to have some organized plan that does have some rigidity to, to enable things to work. So I could imagine that is quite a challenge for you. Uhm, I'm hoping it doesn't, uhm, make it difficult though, for you to see just what you said about some of the things that are working well despite that sense of not just being able to drop by and just kind of on the spur of the moment. Do things with Sam which is what you obviously could have done before and to spontaneously do things. Even though that kind of happened with, uhm, there would be some, some things that are going okay with that, uhm, transition time and, uhm, and Monica making the best of it. You know, what really is sometimes a really challenging situation. 

01:11:20
DAVID Well I, I can see that yeah, she's is been relatively easy going, uhm, and letting me see him. I mean, there's only a few times that she said no but that she's offered alternatives. So I will give her that. There are still some pretty strict and rigid rules and expectations she has for, - 

01:11:45
GERALD MONK So you're, - 

01:11:45
DAVID - for spending time with him. 

01:11:50
GERALD MONK - you're appreciating at least Monica recognizing that it's important for Sam to have time with you and that, uhm, like, I mean, some couples are really mad at one another. Their, their anger and, and distress gets expressed in stopping children having an-- a relatively easy pathway towards engaging with both, with both parents. So that at least do something that you're not captured by and, a-- and that you're recognizing Monica really does want you to have that time with him even though it's not as fluid and as flexible as you'd like. 

01:12:30
DAVID I think it's cuz she thinks that that's what would be best for Sam and not... 

01:12:35
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:12:35
DAVID You know, and she's thinking of him. I think she's thinking of me - 

01:12:40
GERALD MONK Correct. 

01:12:40
DAVID - at all. 

01:12:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. Okay. So Monica, uhm, how about you? What, what, uhm, what's been happening in the last couple of weeks that, ah, things that have been in some-- are somewhat okay in terms of Sam, you know, being with his dad and the arrangements regarding how that happens. How is that view from your perspective? 

01:13:05
MONICA I, I think it's been okay. 

01:13:05
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

01:13:05
MONICA I mean, I, I have my hard times too. 

01:13:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:13:10
MONICA Uhm, you know, I, I'm a primary caregiver and not to say that I'm complaining cuz I'm not. I love, I love Sam. I love when he's with me. 

01:13:20
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:13:20
MONICA Uhm, and I'm a mom so of course I worry when he's not with me. I don't know what's going on. But even then, uhm, I, I don't mind when he has to be with his dad. 

01:13:30
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:13:30
MONICA Like, I know that's, that's necessary. Uhm, and believe it or not, it's a load off me too. I get a chance to kind of just be at home - 

01:13:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:13:40
MONICA - by myself and relax and go out with my sister, visit my mom or whatever. So, so yeah, like... 

01:13:50
GERALD MONK So what-- then in the last couple of weeks, did you say two or three times you s-- you've been with Sam. That, uhm, ha-- that's going okay for you and, and so you're able to relax enough to be able to enjoy your time with your family and friends away from Sam. 

01:14:10
MONICA Yeah, yeah. 

01:14:10
GERALD MONK What do you think, uhm, what do you think David's doing that enables you to feel more comfortable and not so distressed and worried about his, his well-being so you can kind of enjoy that time away from him? 

01:14:25
MONICA Well, I mean, at first when we first start to try this out I was, I was real scared of this. 

01:14:30
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

01:14:30
MONICA You know, things like that. But, uhm, like this last time they went to a baseball game, uhm, and, and Sam just came back so happy. 

01:14:40
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:14:40
MONICA And so excited and everything so - 

01:14:45
GERALD MONK Great. 

01:14:45
MONICA - I mean, ah, I was-- yeah, it was, it was nice to see him, you know, so excited about - 

01:14:50
GERALD MONK Great. 

01:14:55
MONICA - you know, being at a baseball game and stuff like that. So things like that just seeing how happy Sam is when he comes back and I-- there's never been a time where I, uhm, when he's come back from seeing David that I just been upset or anything like that. I mean... 

01:15:10
GERALD MONK Okay, well. 

01:15:10
MONICA Yeah, so... 

01:15:10
GERALD MONK Is it-- that's been consistent since I've seen you both? 

01:15:15
MONICA Pretty consistent. 

01:15:15
GERALD MONK Wow. 

01:15:15
MONICA Yeah. I think some of the stuff where I'm getting it's more about me but that's another thing - 

01:15:25
GERALD MONK Well. 

01:15:25
MONICA - but, yeah. 

01:15:25
GERALD MONK Well, I mean that's-- I mean, ah, a cu-- a little surprising how I have to say that a lo-- a lot of my experience when, you know, couples are-- has separating and, ah, and a lot often-- a lot of anger, a lot of pain around that. But it's really hard to set aside their own feelings and see their children more clearly in terms of what they're experiencing for themselves rather than putting their own viewpoint on it and kind of just, you know, not really allowing the child's experience to be seen. So you're able to see his enjoyment and pleasure and, you know, uhm, excitement that he's had with his dad. 

01:16:05
MONICA Well, I mean, like we talked about before. 

01:16:05
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:16:05
MONICA You know, we've had friends that just-- the kid suffered so much - 

01:16:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:16:10
MONICA - and they miss their dad - 

01:16:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:16:10
MONICA - and they miss whatever. And, and I learned from that, that, you know, my, my son really... 

01:16:20
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:16:20
MONICA I really need to think about the well-being of my son. 

01:16:25
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:16:25
MONICA And, uhm, I feel pretty guilty if I denied it knowing that I had a big part in denying him that. 

01:16:30
GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:16:30
MONICA Uhm... 

01:16:35
GERALD MONK Have there been other times where in the last-- even the last couple of weeks where I mean, you've been intera-- had interactions together, conversations either directly or on the telephone or whatever that have been okay in terms of discussing his well-being and, uhm, that's got okay. 

01:16:55
MONICA I had, uhm, back to school night and, and we went together. 

01:17:00
GERALD MONK Together? 

01:17:00
MONICA Yeah. 

01:17:00
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

01:17:00
MONICA Ah, right. I called. David and I asked him if he could join me since, you know, parents are expected to come and, uhm, I, I would like Sam to see that, you know, we're both his parents. 

01:17:15
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:17:15
MONICA So-- and that I'm not gonna be more involved in the school part and he's gonna be more in all this or whatever so... 

01:17:20
GERALD MONK Did, did the teacher have any idea that you had separated? 

01:17:25
DAVID No. 

01:17:25
GERALD MONK Do you think she was surprised to see the two of you together and, and this went okay. Is that, is that... 

01:17:35
DAVID Well, I think, I think she was happy about it. 

01:17:35
GERALD MONK Great. 

01:17:35
DAVID A little bit surprised but, yeah. 

01:17:40
GERALD MONK Cuz you, you know, she said a lot of parents cannot be in the same room even for an important event like, you know, meet the teacher and I. And, ah, uhm, so, uhm, any other instances that things have gone okay like that? 

01:18:00
DAVID No, I mean, I, I just me painting a pretty rosy picture of the two of us. 

01:18:05
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:18:05
DAVID I wanna let you know that it's definitely not - 

01:18:05
GERALD MONK It's not what you want things to be. 

01:18:05
DAVID - peaches and cream, - 

01:18:10
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:18:10
DAVID - you know? 

01:18:10
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:18:10
DAVID There is still some constraints that she puts on - 

01:18:15
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:18:15
DAVID - my seeing Sam that I don't think is necessarily right or fair. 

01:18:20
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:18:20
DAVID Uhm, you know, and those, those are her personal problems. I understand things are well to get through them but... 

01:18:25
GERALD MONK Well, let's, let's come to that. Let's talk about some of the, the other issues. But before doing so let, let me see if I understood things correctly. Of the last couple of weeks, thi-- things have gone okay for Sam in being, uhm, with his dad, with you David and particularly, and example of that was coming back from baseball and you've just seen his joy and his fondness and excitement and you're appreciating that. You being able to go and be with your friends and your family, your mom and sister and be okay about enjoying yourself and not fretting and, and worrying because, you know, David's not gonna do a good job caring for him. And, and you're also reminding me about why you're here to in mediation rather than take some other course of action because you've seen ugly things that have happened to other people who have taken other routes, uhm, such as going through the whole court system and so on. Uhm, so would it be fair to say that there are some, some-- there have been some okay, uhm, communication and yet there are still things that need to be addressed. Is that, is that fair at this point? 

01:19:40
DAVID Yeah that's it that's fine. 

01:19:40
GERALD MONK All right. How about right now? Let's, ah, I wanna put invitation to the two of you to talk together in front of me to see if there's some way of you starting to-- and, uhm, bring out some of the, uhm, the issues that you think need to be addressed in a way of going forward where Sa-- Sam's future is secure and good things are happening for him. Ah, one, because his parents are happy and okay about how things are going for him personally and, and so that there is good collaboration and, and, uhm, you know, uhm, you men-- you mentioned, uhm, David working, working together and, uhm, there have been times where it's happened. Would, would, would you be willing to do that right now? 

01:20:30
DAVID Sure. 

01:20:30
GERALD MONK Well, go ahead and talk together about what some of the issues are and, and, ah, talk about perhaps finding some ways of addressing them so that, uhm, you can come to some kind of shared understanding, some arrangements for, ah, for Sam. 

01:20:50
MONICA I don't know. Is there anything that's really-- I mean, you're the one that's saying it's so horrible. 

01:20:55
DAVID Well, there's the whole Lisa issue. I think it's a major one. 

01:21:00
MONICA Mm-hmm. What? 

01:21:10
DAVID You got plenty to say about her, you know, outside. Now you clam up in the session. I don't... 

01:21:15
MONICA It's, it's just really hard for me to hear about her from Sam. 

01:21:20
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. 

01:21:20
MONICA And, and lately I hear more about her from Sam and it just... 

01:21:25
GERALD MONK Well, would you want to hear more about her from me? 

01:21:30
MONICA Well, I don't wanna hear about her at all, ah, to tell you the truth. 

01:21:35
DAVID Yeah. 

01:21:35
MONICA Yeah. 

01:21:35
GERALD MONK Well, how about telling, ah, David what's hard to hear about Sam talking about Lisa. How that affects you. 

01:21:50
MONICA Knowing that Lisa brought, you know, such chaos into our life and then now my son is talking about her. Like, oh, yeah, the other day, you know, we went out and Lisa gave me a lollipop or whate-- things like that. I-- It's hard to accept and to take in from my child, you know. And here I am like, oh. Cuz I'm trying to not make this messy or anything like that and, yeah. That's not gonna be something I can just get over after today. 

01:22:35
DAVID But like we said the last time we were here, it's not as if Lisa created all the chaos in our family. The chaos was already there. 

01:22:45
MONICA Yeah, but drugs weren't there. You know, lying wasn't there. All that kind of stuff wasn't there. And the-- like, honestly, she represents that to me. It's gonna be really hard until she-- and this is so bad. That, like until, like she commits to a convent or something like that where I'm like, okay, she's a good person. It's gonna hard for me to really take in like, oh, she's turned over a new leaf. I can accept that from you because I see you. You know, I see how you are with Sam but when she's around, I just-- I don't know. Yeah, I don't want, I don't want that its hard-- it-- yeah, yeah. 

01:23:35
DAVID Well, I think that's the major sticking point right now. It's that for me to see Sam, it's almost like Lisa needs to be on a business trip in Paris that I'm like, you know, there's, there's no way to know that she could be around, there is any chance. You know, she's even basically said, you know, that you can see Sam, that's fine but as long as she is not around. If I find out from somebody else that she's around, then forget it. 

01:24:05
GERALD MONK What did you think of the idea, uhm, when Monica was talking that she said she's-- I wrote this down, I'm not trying to make things messy. And what I was understanding from that was I know Sam is sharing some things about Lisa that are positive. It's not easy for you to hear them and when you said that what I was thinking was you try not have your own hurt and distress around Lisa being with Sam, putting that on him and recognizing something that I'm having to kind of deal with rather than-- is that what you mean when you said, uhm, I'm trying not to make things messy? 

01:24:45
MONICA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:45
GERALD MONK Am I reading it... 

01:24:45
MONICA Yeah. 

01:24:45
GERALD MONK Things in correct to that? 

01:24:45
MONICA Well, yeah. Because I can't-- well he can tell you and I just don't want him to get into it so I kinda wanna rile up my feelings but I hate her. 

01:24:55
GERALD MONK All right. 

01:24:55
MONICA I hate Lisa. 

01:25:00
GERALD MONK Ah, do you-- you don't tell Sam that? 

01:25:00
MONICA No! I can't! 

01:25:05
GERALD MONK So you keep, you keep adult things in adult places and you don't bring - 

01:25:10
MONICA Yeah. 

01:25:10
GERALD MONK - that, those strong feelings - 

01:25:10
MONICA Yeah. 

01:25:10
GERALD MONK - on, on to him. 

01:25:10
MONICA Yeah. So when he's like, oh, mommy, ah, Lisa was with us and we went for ice cream and, oh, she's pretty cool mommy. I'm like, oh, mm-hmm, you know. Yeah, honey. And so it's-- I... 

01:25:30
GERALD MONK So you're really respecting Sam - 

01:25:30
MONICA I'm trying. 

01:25:30
GERALD MONK - and not to mess things up for him. Can you imagine how difficult that might be when you have a really strong reaction? You're not bringing them on to the-- on to each other? 

01:25:40
DAVID Well, no. I can understand the reactions but I think that... 

01:25:40
GERALD MONK Do you appreciate that? Do you think that's a helpful thing that Monica is doing despite the fact that she's has such strong negative reactions towards Lisa. 

01:25:50
DAVID No. Actually I think it's a little irrational. 

01:25:50
GERALD MONK Uh-huh. You think her strong reactions, her own reactions to Lisa are irrational? 

01:25:55
DAVID Yeah. I mean, I get it. 

01:26:00
GERALD MONK What about her-- well, what about... 

01:26:00
DAVID I mean, the thing is she doesn't, she doesn't even know Lisa. She's never even sat down and talked to her. 

01:26:05
GERALD MONK Okay. 

01:26:05
DAVID I mean, you know, it's all built up around this stuff. 

01:26:05
GERALD MONK Right. 

01:26:05
DAVID I mean, yeah, you met her that Christmas party at one time - 

01:26:10
GERALD MONK Mm-hmm. 

01:26:10
DAVID - from my work but I was just passing. You know, but since then, then she was okay. Now, you know, Satan embody such link. 

01:26:20
GERALD MONK So how are you gonna make this work? You both want to collaborate, you wanna figure out a long term arrangement for Sam and his well-being. You've got these very strong reactions to Lisa. Is Lisa gonna be continuing to be present in your life or an extended time or as far as you know. 

01:26:40
DAVID Maybe. Possibly. 

01:26:40
GERALD MONK So I'm just wondering to the extent to which how much Lisa becomes part of the conversation as far you're concerned and, uhm... 

01:26:50
DAVID Well that's-- I mean it's almost-- I mean, you know, Monica has been putting a limit on my relationship with Lisa because basically sa-- I mean, just hypothetical which I'm not saying is even in the cards. Uhm, you know, what if a couple of years down the road, I've-- we decided to get married. Lisa and I decided to get married. Well, that's it. It's either gonna be Lisa or my son and I don't think that's fair. 

01:27:10
GERALD MONK Okay, how you are going to solve this all again I'm inviting you to talk together and see how you are gonna get to a better place with this? 

01:27:20
DAVID I mean do you blame the failure of our relationship on Lisa squarely on her shoulders? 

01:27:30
MONICA Hmm, no not all of it but a big chunk at least the second time. 

01:27:40
DAVID You think that's fair? 

01:27:40
MONICA Hmm, yeah I think you would have given it a little bit more effort actually not being in the picture honestly. 

01:27:55
DAVID Okay I want just to throw an idea out there what if it wasn't Lisa but it was somebody else? 

01:28:00
MONICA I don't know. 

01:28:00
DAVID What if she wasn't the cause the problem, she was just a symptom? 

01:28:05
MONICA I don't know. I, I don't know. I was the only person I see causing the problem is her. That-- I mean the first time we had our fall out and everything and I was really upset. And I know there was a lot more stuff involved in it but the second time like I was really trying the whole parted make things work and things like that and just know that she was back in the picture again I just, just, yeah. You know just I was alright. And now I like it, it's that I was saying that I was it pulled me once shame on you, for me twice, shame on me. And I'm not going to be made a fool, you know, I'm not. You know that about me I am very... 

01:29:00
DAVID No but I, yeah, I understand that. I just... 

01:29:05
GERALD MONK What do you understand, tell, tell Monica what do you understand? 

01:29:15
DAVID I just you know you have a very strong sense of self very strong sense of pride. You know, I can see how the situation hurt that pride and it is hard for you to see that but I don't think it is fair to put squarely on just your shoulders. I mean, it's almost like you think that she is sitting wherever she is right now under her house Cathleen (ph), you know rubbing her hands together happy that you know she was able to put the herself. Yeah, but now, she feels bad about it too but it just one of those things that you know situation when it was right what there was in the right place. Maybe at the wrong time but things weren't good between us, good things tried to happen between Lisa and I. 

01:30:10
[sil.] 

01:30:15
DAVID Honestly I think that she would actually kind of like it but she Monica like Lisa but you know that's completely unreasonable at this point. That is right there. 

01:30:30
GERALD MONK Where you-- when you mentioned before that the possibility that further down the line may be you would make a, a long term commitment to Lisa get married her now is... 

01:30:45
DAVID I'm not-- I'm not able to think of all those like. 

01:30:45
GERALD MONK No you are prophesying. Well I was understanding from what you were saying was that it may be that Lisa might be in Sam's life for a while. It is not temporary and that it is likely that Lisa is not going to see Sam anymore or he is not going to be in your life at all in the next few days or even might in the next week or so. With something that seems to be more momentum than a, a temporary. 

01:31:15
DAVID Well, it mean right now she is big part of my life Sam is big part of my life. 

01:31:15
GERALD MONK You are living, you are... 

01:31:15
DAVID We have to keep those two. 

01:31:20
GERALD MONK Alright, you, you both live together at this point. 

01:31:20
DAVID No, no have my apartment she got her own place. 

01:31:25
GERALD MONK Okay, and you have a long time together. 

01:31:30
DAVID We potentially lot of time together that. 

01:31:35
GERALD MONK Okay, Monica so I, I hear what you are saying hate is a strong word, but that's that merits the strength of your actions when you talk, when you think about Lisa , when you think about you relationship, when you think about it coming apart... 

01:31:45
MONICA Yeah. 

01:31:50
GERALD MONK As a couple. And you are clear about that and you are also clear that you are owning some of your own reactions to here, you mentioned that before. What is it then mean for the future and that you are acknowledging Sam loves being with his dad, once they have time with his dad you honor or acknowledge the significance and importance in that, you also appreciate the importance of having some quality time yourself, to enjoy your life, as separately from him and how that you didn't say that my sense was that kind of feeds in a way that your connection with your family, and your mom and sister and friends. And so all these things are happening and it may be that this is now something that is going to be going for quite a long time. 

01:32:40
MONICA Yeah. 

01:32:45
GERALD MONK What, what you are going to do? You came here wanting to try and collaborate to build some trust to try and find a way of, of getting on the other side of this. What ideas do you have about how you are going to manage those strong feeling in a way that keeps doing(ph) what you said which was all when you mess things up for, for Sam in terms of putting emotions on him. 

01:33:10
MONICA Well I mean I hate tell him like this but when David said right now, uhm, that I can't get this picture on my head off, what, what I did say cac-- cracking(ph) that she was... 

01:33:30
DAVID Sitting in the apartment crackling her fingers together. 

01:33:30
MONICA Yes. 

01:33:30
GERALD MONK Enjoying the pain that you might be experiencing or the fact that the things you have gone through. 

01:33:35
MONICA I could, yeah, like I said I hate her but, but that's what I think, that's how I see Lisa , back then and now, hasn't changed. And now here in like, I know, you are saying, okay may be hypothetically answer but hearing that if he would marry her I think that would be the ultimate like, ah, ah, in your face. 

01:34:05
GERALD MONK Its some-- its somehow that when you hear Lisa you, your strong feelings come up of, of hatred is one word you use and I am wondering another word you didn't you but it is something about revenge of seeing you really hurting badly and you imagine her getting a lot of pleasure in seeing your pain in this... 

01:34:30
DAVID This is that. Just like a competition and she lost Lisa won. 

01:34:30
MONICA No it is not a competition I was unfair to me anyway it just-- it just feels wrong, that is just how I feel. It just feels wrong like I just fell wrong. 

01:34:45
DAVID So say Lisa and I broke up and I started doing somebody else. 

01:34:55
MONICA I, I, I think I would feel a little better about that. I think I don't know, I don't know. I am not going like I don't know but it just I feels I think that way would just feel I don't why it's... 

01:35:10
DAVID But it's like-- it's like she is, she Lisa is being a scapegoat for all the things that went wrong with our marriage. You know, like I think... 

01:35:15
GERALD MONK Talk, talk to her. 

01:35:15
DAVID Honestly Lisa weren't even in the picture that this marriage would not have worked out. 

01:35:25
MONICA Probably. But... 

01:35:30
DAVID So... 

01:35:30
MONICA I am-- I am not saying I don't want to change, but I'm saying that is how I am feel right now. I mean you what you said right now that-- I had never thought about it that way but that is like I don't know I guess I had thought it but never-- I never connected it. I never connected like oh! Yeah, she is all the where and you know... 

01:35:50
GERALD MONK What words would you use to describe that? I use the word somehow some kind of re-- revenge or even vengeful actions how-- what, what words do you describe that state of things? 

01:36:05
MONICA Hmm. Like conniving, like I just feel that, like conniving because there was just such like back then when everything was happening it just when I found out about everything. I just thought it was like oh! Here they were sneaking around and, and just and so... 

01:36:30
GERALD MONK And so that she was plotting your demise... 

01:36:35
MONICA Yeah. 

01:36:35
GERALD MONK Planning to grab your husband and insuring that whatever she did that this would inflict the maximum amount of pain and harm on you so that then she could have David also herself. 

01:36:45
MONICA Yeah. 

01:36:45
GERALD MONK That's the sense you had that she think about. 

01:36:45
MONICA That's a sense and I know when I say it seems like so irrational and I hate that because I am not like that. I am so work that I do, the way I try to raise my child, the way I tried to be-- tried to be with David like I'm not is trying to be like okay logical. You know let's make sense of things. That's about-- I mean just... 

01:37:15
GERALD MONK This is not your best self when you see yourself being the way, you see yourself it is almost shocking to hear you describe another person these terms... 

01:37:25
MONICA Yeah. 

01:37:25
GERALD MONK That's because more what I am sensing from what you are saying is that you see yourself as reasonable person. 

01:37:30
MONICA Yeah. 

01:37:30
GERALD MONK Uhm, you know realistic, uhm, ah, you know, uhm, living in-- living in the real world and when and yet when you start to think about her, this intensity comes up and you are almost a shocked at your own reactions. 

01:37:45
MONICA Yeah, yeah. 

01:37:45
GERALD MONK And doesn't fit the kind of person you see it have to be. 

01:37:50
MONICA No, not at all. Always I think I mean, I don't know... 

01:37:50
DAVID That's surprising. I mean... 

01:37:55
MONICA What surprising? 

01:37:55
DAVID She go through what you know background so you should see her in her family put together like fights, I mean they are very passionate, they are very outspoken, very emotional and things like that. So no I mean yes logical. You have never been this cold emotion just open. We have always been very passionately itself. 

01:38:15
MONICA Yeah, no may be that something. 

01:38:20
GERALD MONK And yet despite the strength of the reactions that you have and that conniving with what that you used, somehow you are able to separate the intensity of the feelings and not put them on Sam when he talks about Lisa . So almost that you are honoring his experience to some extent without putting your own really powerful feeling on to her profound and you are also saying rely on some of that which is also let me tell you kind of surprising given some of the facts that I work with, that they can have that level of insight that you have. You know I'm so, I'm personally very touched how you are able to recognize those things in your self-giving the strength of your action. 

01:39:00
MONICA Well that's, yeah. 

01:39:05
GERALD MONK And not and trying not to make things messy. 

01:39:10
MONICA That's the bow I, I have. I mean, yeah, passionate like I am so passionate about being a mom, Yeah. 

01:39:15
GERALD MONK I am I, I feel that, I hear that. 

01:39:20
MONICA And don't want to I don't want to mess that up, you know. 

01:39:25
GERALD MONK You are also passionate about wanting to have a balanced life for Sam in have dad in his life the whole being together with the teacher for-- what's the code again? 

01:39:35
MONICA Back to school. 

01:39:35
GERALD MONK Back to school right the fact that was important for you to both be there and it didn't erupt in any bad exchanges between you. 

01:39:45
DAVID No. 

01:39:45
GERALD MONK It didn't go that well? 

01:39:45
MONICA Didn't go well. 

01:39:50
DAVID More over alright she was... 

01:39:50
GERALD MONK She was still some kind of strong... 

01:39:55
DAVID She didn't really allow her. 

01:39:55
GERALD MONK Which isn't surprising, which isn't surprising me given what you're going through but yet you were there, you presented yourselves as being there for Sam and so how is this going to unfold now because here I am wanting to support the two of you to come up with some kind of plan that's not working correctly because Sam is, ah, getting these small amounts of time with his dad, I think ideally you are wanting to get to a place where you can have more time, just more fluidity, hopefully and you guys, if you have more time with your son and you enjoy he, he-- Sam having more time with time. You also being out to live your life too and do other things you want to do. How, how you can build on the strength that you sort of try to manage those strong feelings and not keep putting on, on him, on, on Sam in particular. I was wondering how this, you know, how this is going to go now, what you are going to do? What you might do to help support the transitionally given the strength of the MONICA has even though you have a different understanding about how things happened and why should she be feeling differently given that you experience I was a good person. How, how might you kind a negotiate and do what you both said you wanted to do last we met which was to col-- collaborate? 

01:41:30
[sil.] 

01:41:40
MONICA Well I mean I know I am just to get over. Somewhat it, it's not all my fault, the thought is... 

01:41:50
GERALD MONK That's unlikely that all of sudden given the strength of your feelings that all of sudden it is going to evaporate - 

01:41:55
MONICA Yeah, it's not. 

01:41:55
GERALD MONK - so I mean that's-- So what I am wondering about are there some steps that each of you could take recognizing that you have already been building some steps, one we want to collaborate we don't want to go through and ugly divorce process in court and lose all of the resources that we have and, and see we get away people form of what you are seeing other couples go through. 

01:42:20
MONICA Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

01:42:20
GERALD MONK And want to make the most of this. You are earning your famous struck and doing your best in manage them which you describe an example of, and you kind of coping with the unsatisfactory nature of how things are right now and yet kind of hanging there and having some great time with Sam and really wanting to build on that. 

01:42:40
DAVID So as you are say I need to chill out until she feels better. 

01:42:45
GERALD MONK No, not because you have to live with whatever arrangements are going to work for you. What it seems and realistic to do is to suggest that, uhm, Lisa is going to be out of the picture all together. That's not realistic for you that's she in your life now. 

01:43:05
DAVID Now, now, now. 

01:43:05
GERALD MONK You spent a lot of time together and you don't want to compartmentalize your life in this artificial way of separating your time with Sam and yet not or so be out include Lisa who's an important person in your life now. 

01:43:20
DAVID Uh-hmm. 

01:43:20
GERALD MONK Even though that is awful and painful to hear that's the reality. Ah, so I am looking at you working at trying to despite how that must be difficult for you to, to figure, uhm, Monica not to accept so as you saying, she is not this evil person that you have made out to be so that must be hard to hear that. How-- what might the next step be that is reasonable and realistic given the intensity of feelings that each of you much have about things. It has to work for you two but the most of all it has to work for Sam which is might Sam says that you both have been telling me that that's what we want for him. 

01:44:15
DAVID Well, honestly I think probably the best situation-- what the best solution in this situation, potentially, and again it's my opinion but you, you know you can just meet with Lisa and just. I'm not saying best friends or, you know, she is not an awful person, she isn't going to be the type of person to be, you know, let simply with razor blades, you know, I mean not like that but just to actually meet her and get an idea because really I think that-- I understand that she is hurt. I, I get that, but it's-- I think it's unfair to put the blame squarely on her shoulders. 

01:45:05
GERALD MONK Yeah, you mean that she note her a few times and - 

01:45:10
DAVID Uh-hmm. 

01:45:10
GERALD MONK - for you it's what took your apart was not Lisa. So you are really clear about that you also acknowledge there were more of other difficult things going on but she is as far you are concerned to be part of that. I want to, I want to apologize a little bit for merely a, a interaction we had you said-- and I feel, I feel like kind I was disrespecting you said you know, I need to get over. 

01:45:35
MONICA Uh-hmm. 

01:45:35
GERALD MONK And what I wished I said was what is that, that you need to get over and, and what ideas do you have about how that might happen rather than coming in quickly with achieving things about, what that means to you? Co, co, co-- come back to that, that come, what, what does that, what does mean to you? 

01:45:55
MONICA Well getting alright mean talking to her - 

01:46:00
GERALD MONK Uh-hmm. 

01:46:00
MONICA - like I, I don't like to do that. And not right now. 

01:46:05
GERALD MONK Uh-hmm. 

01:46:05
MONICA May be later, may be, ah-- no, no. I can't even think about that right now. But, but, yeah, it's like I'm just sitting here thinking how crazy I must sound thinking that she is really right now sitting in her house like concerned about us and just, you know, like wicked witch would be... 

01:46:30
GERALD MONK Like the wicked witch sitting by her cauldron. 

01:46:35
MONICA Yeah. And I... 

01:46:35
GERALD MONK Thinking up new spells. 

01:46:35
MONICA Yeah. 

01:46:35
GERALD MONK To put on you two like more pain on you. 

01:46:40
MONICA Yeah and the more and more I'm like seeing her thinking yeah the more I am sitting here I'm like oh my God-- I don't, I don't know. And that's the part I'm like I need to know about that. I don't know what, what that's going to look like, I don't know if that's going to make me, oh! What excited to hear oh! Really honey tell me more about Lisa like. I will be let's going to do all that but at least-- I mean that's going to make me feel different and so we are so, so, yeah, I am just saying alright now. 

01:47:10
GERALD MONK It looks like you are going through a lot of intense reflection and the value adding things right now. 

01:47:20
MONICA Well, yeah. And then, yeah, I am just thinking about that right now. So... 

01:47:30
GERALD MONK So you knew something about that why did you think I, I need over this, I need to stop this level of emotional investment on having someone who is cause me pain. And construct by her much power she has kind of over you given the intensity of your own feelings which must lot and settle lot of what you are imagining. 

01:47:50
MONICA Yeah, what even though you're talking about her right now makes me think like oh! My Gosh I am really letting this take over like really more it has to. And... 

01:48:05
GERALD MONK It's not surprising of doing what experienced from your side. And yet you are seeing that Monica someone who you can work things out, out with you worked a number of things before, you have tried a number of things. Can you imagine from the times you have known Monica and abilities to solve problems that you, you could see her working away through this and time to get little bit of pledge. 

01:48:30
DAVID That's, that's the hope, yeah. 

01:48:35
GERALD MONK Uh-hmm. 

01:48:35
DAVID I mean you know ideally. 

01:48:35
GERALD MONK So you put on my idea. 

01:48:35
DAVID You want enough, you know, - 

01:48:40
GERALD MONK Yeah. 

01:48:40
DAVID - where we can still have an amicable, - 

01:48:40
GERALD MONK Yeah. 

01:48:40
DAVID - you know, a friendship with at least, at least you know birthday party to or, you know, graduation thing like that, you know what I mean? I'm, I'm not saying we need to live in each other's pockets but.... 

01:48:55
GERALD MONK Could you imagine sharing a bit a, a birthday day with Sam the two of you somehow being involved in sharing the time with him... 

01:49:05
DAVID Yeah right. 

01:49:05
GERALD MONK Rather than one of you monopolizing the time with him so he does he get to be with both of you. 

01:49:10
DAVID Not right now. 

01:49:10
MONICA And I'm fine because I'm thinking every time a week or at least the last time we tried to plan something he mentioned Lisa and I just went crazy. I did. 

01:49:20
GERALD MONK So you... 

01:49:20
DAVID That-- I mean that's one reasons why he can't the weekend over my place too, you have said that. 

01:49:30
MONICA Uh-hmm. But, but part of it is, it's just a lot of worry I have to, and it's, and it's not just Lisa it's not one hundred percent, I mean as I think, - 

01:49:40
GERALD MONK Uh-hmm. 

01:49:40
MONICA - now that I am thinking about on my so called, yeah. But just all other stuff that comes along with it, like, that stuff you and Lisa were doing, like having drugs and I know you are telling me that it is not happening and, and things like that but I just it's... 

01:50:00
DAVID We get that mentally which is you know this cracked and that we go and visit while Sam sits in the corner place with little thing. 

01:50:05
MONICA And not even that but just knowing that you could get yourself into that. 

01:50:10
GERALD MONK Its kind of shocking. 

01:50:10
MONICA Its kind of shocking. 

01:50:10
GERALD MONK To see David be associated with that. 

01:50:15
MONICA Yeah, yeah because I had a very different idea of the way things were going and I thought everything I mean I have told you before that it was I couldn't believe that you got into that. And it's, it's easy for me to know that, that you know want to be a man. When you said I don't want to do this, I don't want to you know it's not me all that kinds of how it's like I know that's not you. 

01:50:45
DAVID And it's not me forget it rigid thinking you put in the spots I have done what twice, two times just now make me this, you know (inaudible ) where I'm blowing thousands of dollars a week trying to finding aspects. 

01:51:05
MONICA Yeah, but you... 

01:51:05
DAVID I did it twice. 

01:51:05
MONICA But, but the thing is that-- that's such a horrible to me that's such a horrible thing and you allowed yourself to it, to get into to that. Knowing your dad, knowing your husband, knowing, and you ruin affair and all that just hurt me yes, yes but it just-- I just I couldn't believe about you, about you. 

01:51:30
DAVID That's fair. 

01:51:35
GERALD MONK One of, you know, one of my jobs here is to make sure that this time is uses as effectively as possible its costly within your time resources. You put out a suggestion and what I am, what I am saying here is to try and let's see if we can get some kind of practical things in place that you both can live with for Sam's benefit. You came up with one idea of maybe you got off from Lisa then if you could kind of calm down Lisa and see that she is an ordinary person who is not going to do terrible things to your son. Then we might I'm really I'm out of it, into this but I am sensing that this is if you, if you got to meet together at my work. What you are saying is I'm not ready anything like that right now. What are some others small steps building on your willingness to collaborate that hopes you come up little-- a little further forward than way things are up right now. And we can, ah, we can come back and, ah, meet again. Uhm, my sense though would be you would like let me see if my assumption is right. Would you like to have moved forward some steps in terms of figuring out arrangements before you would come back again and meet with me about making some final arrangements and understandings. At least, not to say final for a period of time that you can you try out and work with. Uhm, before you come back is that something you would both want over time? 

01:53:15
MONICA Yeah I, I would like. 

01:53:15
GERALD MONK Okay well how about again something, uhm, some step that builds on all the good things that you have been able to hold on to, even though you may not be aware of that I'm-- I have got a, a big list of things that you have already adoring that's great, that if you weren't doing them Sam could be really harmed. And so you are kind of looking really up for him. What's another step you can take? 

01:53:45
[sil.] 

01:53:55
MONICA Uhm, I am just thinking about how many times you have off time for the weekend. So... 

01:54:05
GERALD MONK Because as you, as you stayed with David for weekends and she has been apart. Will there be a step that you could support, Monica? And this is something you would like to obviously for working together to stay over. 

01:54:30
MONICA I, I would, I would like to lead up to that yeah definitely I'm just sure of what I say that right now. 

01:54:40
GERALD MONK So you-- what you are doing is pushing you are pushing yourself right down for, for Sam's benefit because your own emotional feelings about yourself don't fit what you are saying but you are thinking of your son pushing yourself forward to consider one step of having weekend with his dad and staying all the night. Will that effects two nights or one night? Because... 

01:55:05
DAVID Friday, Saturday but everyone for one. 

01:55:10
GERALD MONK These are big decisions, big decisions for you, big decisions for Sam. 

01:55:15
MONICA Uhm... 

01:55:20
DAVID I mean I will one night starting spot I was thinking about that early actually I will be okay with, like the Friday or Saturday night. And then, you know, may be the morning. 

01:55:35
GERALD MONK This is what you want to do Monica? Well, let me, let me rephrase that, is this something you are willing to do for Sam? 

01:55:45
MONICA Yes, first yeah, yeah, he would be asking for some want to do all bit late, I don't know but yeah, for Sam yeah. And I don't want Sam like I want put a lot of rules or anything like that but, I mean, and I know you would take care of this but just confirming that you know, you have sit on space and all that kind of stuff and yeah. 

01:56:10
DAVID And I think I am taking about is just something that you said, and you said that this didn't mean this but that's the way I took it like a kind of stuck with me. 

01:56:20
GERALD MONK Uhm-mm. 

01:56:20
DAVID So my interpretation to what you said is that I do need to just kind of chill out and understand that Monica and I do understand this is going to be difficult situation. Like it is hard I mean as soon as I said it, I kind of thought well, yeah, she is in a losing situation. 

01:56:40
GERALD MONK Are you, are you willing to-- its kind of the same of thing that you want to be chill out for Sam's benefit, in kind of being able to restrain yourself and kind of recognize the intensity of what Monica is experiencing enough to not put pressure on right now. And allow a one night event and then re-visit this again. Is this what you are, you are both considering? 

01:57:10
DAVID And I just want to you know state that it's not like we should be a new surrogate mother. Not every time that I would have send word that the three of us. 

01:57:20
GERALD MONK When you are doing when-- sorry proceed. 

01:57:20
MONICA That's-- and just to want that to okay and I am going to push myself back. I just hope you know that I am trying to push myself here. But if she spends, he spends only one he spends the night, uhm... 

01:57:35
DAVID If she can't manage that. 

01:57:35
MONICA If she can't spend the night I mean I understand if she is around and I am going to you know that's obviously but-- uhm, but I just, I am just... 

01:57:45
GERALD MONK Is there something you could have done it? 

01:57:45
DAVID Yeah. 

01:57:45
GERALD MONK Okay what we, we got to need to wrap up. Uhm, now let's just see where if, if we are in the same page. You are willing to try a night a Friday-- is it a Friday or did, did you mentioned I don't know whether you mentioned a night (inaudible ) specific... 

01:58:08
MONICA I am okay at that one. 

01:58:10
GERALD MONK Either night Friday night or Saturday night, uhm, let me put it to you like this, do you want to try this over a period of a couple of weekends and then we meet again like if it goes okay, that you, you try to even that we are meeting two weeks a kind of reflect and then think about what would another step be in terms of how this might look, or would you rather try once and then come back here and let me catch up with how things have gone and look at the next steps after that work. How do you want to proceed? 

01:58:45
DAVID Your call. 

01:58:50
MONICA Yeah that's, let saw couple. 

01:58:50
GERALD MONK You will try a couple of weekends. 

01:58:50
MONICA Couple of weekends. 

01:58:55
GERALD MONK May be one night either Friday or Saturday? Do you feel like you are collaborating enough and working enough together to figure out together where-- whether it's a Friday night or Saturday night would you feel here that you would need to identify which night? 

01:59:10
DAVID No, I think we could. 

01:59:10
MONICA Yeah, I think we are okay I mean... 

01:59:10
DAVID And we are just like freeing out you know like sort of... 

01:59:15
MONICA Yeah, yeah. 

01:59:15
GERALD MONK Okay, well, uhm, do you think Sam if he was sitting here, uhm, listening now about the idea that he is going to have a night with his dad, do you think he would be happy with this development, or scared, or excited or how would Sam be doing, listening on this part of the conversation? 

01:59:35
MONICA Yeah, I think it's like, oh, you know last minute now it is really close your eyes and go to bed but, but I mean if he does get sacred I'm-- I mean I will be the one and only that pick him up or you can take over or whatever but... 

01:59:55
GERALD MONK Do you think... 

01:59:55
DAVID That, that, that comes one Sam , that's not our issue that's yeah. 

01:59:55
MONICA Yeah. 

01:59:55
GERALD MONK Yeah, yeah, can we close now knowing that you, that you two think this is going to work out okay between the two of you. And, ah, let's, ah, go out to our-- out reservation book and look at making another, another appointment perhaps in a couple of weeks. Is that seems sensible? 

02:00:15
MONICA Yeah. 

02:00:20
GERALD MONK And let me look at keep this process just moving along the way you have helped make that happen today. 

02:00:25
MONICA Yeah sounds good. 

02:00:25
GERALD MONK Great alright let's go in there.
