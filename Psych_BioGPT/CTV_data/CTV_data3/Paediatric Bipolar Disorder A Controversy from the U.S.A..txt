Paediatric Bipolar Disorder (PBD) -a controversy from the USA; Dr Peter Parry, Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist, Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia 

00:00:00
DR. PETER PARRY Hi, Peter Parry is my name. I'm a child, adolescent psychiatrist working in Addely, South Australia. My academic status is Senior Lecturer with the University. Uh, I was asked to give this talk by the Australian Counseling Academy. And uh, the title of the talk is Pediatric Bipolar Disorder a controversy from the United States. I've got 170 uh, slides here. Uh, and uh, I'm not going to go through them all in detail. But I, the advantage of viewing this online is you can pause me at any point and uh, read through the slide in more detail.

Disclosure: I've given this talk approx 15 times and received an honorarium ranging from $100 to $400 on 3 occasions. One free occasion was for an online conference by the "Australian Counselling Academy". It led to this online lecture at invitation from the "Mental Health Academy". The MHA pays 30% commission to the authors. 

00:00:50
DR. PETER PARRY Uh, by way of disclosure, I'm a member on an organization called Healthy Skepticism which was set up by Dr. Peter Mansfield. Uh, who was honored by a Australian medal for his work. Which uh, it's motto is: "Improving health by reducing harm by misleading drug promotion." Peter and I were interns together when we were at Addely Hospital in 1983. On this next slide I have a quote from a paper by John McClellan, who is a child psychiatrist from Seattle in the U.S.A. and John Werry who's an emeritus professor of child psychology in Auckland,(ph) New Zealand. And this was in the journal of The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry in 2003. As you can see there, they say that in child psychiatry, "...we still suffer faddish waves of unsupportable treatments and idiosyncratic diagnostic practices, caution and humility are indicated when assessing our current standards of care." And really this does reflect that the subject area um, that I work in mainly child and adolescent psychiatry is still struggling uh, to um, be a science. A full science. And we struggle and I think quite rightly so, the humanities and the sciences. And sort of a diagnosis pediatric bipolar it highlights a lot of these, these problems that we're grappling with in trying to define child and adolescent uh, mental uh, illnesses and also just emotional behavioral problems and problems of distress. The traditional view with which you would probably be familiar is that bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness with onset in the late teens to early '20's. And it's defined by some strict criteria in the neurological manual like DSM-IV and ICD-10. However, there were some early calls for instance by uh, Gabrielle Carlson back in the early '80's that perhaps in the same way that depression had been overlooked in younger people and children, pre-adolescent children that perhaps mania also has been overlooked. And there was a suggestion the pre-pubertal mania may be atypical in its presentation, with hyperactivity and lack of discrete episodes. Remember that name too, because, because it's still very much the for in this uh, area. Uh, and she had a paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry last year in January of 2009. And this was uh, about two ten year old boys, one who uh, had become apparent does indeed the early onset mania uh, and the other does not has being a diagnosed has having it. This, in terms of epidemiological studies these tend to support the traditional view of a disorder coming on after puberty. And I'll let you perhaps pause a minute and uh, read through that in some more detail. And the next slide shows exactly the same. Uh, for instance uh, way back in 1952 a review of two 2,200 pediatric psychiatric uh, patients only two teens with manic depression. Uh, the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital no children under the age of 11. And uh, the youngest in Maudsley 22 year respective uh, was an 11 year old as well. Werry and McClellan come up again here. Uh, they had an important study uh, which was a um, highly retrospective and partly perspective study over a 20 year period for the Auckland, uh, Northern island of New Zealand, in the catchment area. And only 59 um, cases uh, vary psychosis was presented to the under 18 age inpatient unit over that whole time. Of which only three were under the age of 12, uh, and the youngest bipolar was one of those three at the age of 9. In other words, we're talking about rare disorder. If uh, one tries to look at the onset of bipolar by asking adults when did you first have uh, your first episode of depression or first episode of mania or hyper-mania. Then really it's been like how long is a piece of string if one looks at literature. And the next slide shows uh, different kind of quotes there. If uh, one looks here at some Australian data from mid-, uh, from Mitchell et al at the Black Dog Institute in the New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry last year, one finds the age of onset of mood disturbance uh, being 21 plus or minus 7.9 years in standard deviation. Uh, but for the excerpt were under the age of 18. However, over half of these were depressive episodes so one wouldn't be necessarily be able to diagnosis bipolar by that point. Uh, Berk et al from Geelong in Melbourne uh, study published in the Medical Journal of Australia and this was asking when was your first onset of any symptoms and the median age was 17 and a half. First manic symptoms then at the age of 21 and the first manic episode age 24. However, bipolar diagnosis came late uh, with uh, a median, I'm sorry, a mean age of a diagnosis being 30. Uh, the Post et al report another retrospective recall study in the British Journal of Psychiatry, and this is interesting in terms of the topic of this talk because it compared uh, rights between the United States and Europe, it named the Netherlands and Germany. And only 2% of European cohorts of adults with bipolar disorder felt that their disorder came on uh, under the age of 13; which 22% of Americans thought so. Uh, so coming to the pediatric bipolar disorder it really only hit the psychiatric literature in the mid '90's uh, with a paper by Watson et al. in 1995. We probably really only made a bigger splash when it came to this paper uh, "Child and Adolescents Bipolar Disorder A Review of the Past 10 Years", by Geller and Luby. And Geller is from Washington University in Saint Louis and talks about how in children, adolescents mania is constrained by the developmental level. So, for instance uh, an elevated mood might be a child laughing when their being suspended in the principals office. Uh, grandiose decisions this could be a teenager who thinks that they've got rock star skills, and plays the guitar all day out of tune and uh, teenagers having crushes uh, um, intense crushes uh, on their teachers. The other aspect uh, was that um, the rather meeting four days for hyper-mania, seven days for diagnosed mania uh, she talked about children and adolescents actually cycling in a very rapid fashion needing only four hours for a cycle. So, you could cycle three or four times a day. So this was taken off the website of the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation. Uh, noticing the cycling pattern is called ultra-rating cycling. And Geller's work was featured in Archives of General Psychiatry in 2008. And she followed her cohort for roughly 10 years, from round about age 8 through about age 18. And found that um, and what you can see in this is that um, the diagnosis was based on the Washington University Kiddy Schedule for Effective Disorders and Schizophrenia and that the mean duration of the episode when the cohort was age about 8 was 212 weeks. In other words, four years, uh, when ultralian cycling occurring in 88% of those. And even by the time that this group was around 8, age 18 two-thirds of them were still having an ultralian cycling pattern. And there was a lot of co-mobility with the disruptive behavior disorders. Interesting also correlation with low maternal warmth, though that wasn't expanded on very much in the paper. Coming at this from a some what different angle was the work of uh, Biederman and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Uh, and their um, uh, hypothesis was that hallmark of mania in children and adolescents is irritability. To the extent that on doesn't necessary need to see euphoric, uh or expansive or elevated mood. So these children have affective storms, mood liabilities, severe temper outburst, poor concentration, and impulsively uh, and without any necessarily uh, clear episodicity that would be like just about all the time. And their difficult to wake up all the time in the morning and hard to get to bed at night. This again taken up by bpchildren.com pointing out that uh, very young children can have this, babies. That uh, terrible temper tantrums might ensue particularly if "no" is in the parental vocabulary. However, somehow the child manages to contain this down at the supermarket. And they can suddenly veer from morbid to hopeless uh, up to silly, giddy, and goofy in short periods of time. So by applying these criteria uh, Biederman's group found that you could diagnose at least a quarter of children who either had a diagnosis of ADHD, obstructional(ph) find, conduct disorder as having a comorbid pediatric bipolar disorder. And the next slide shows that with the orange horizontal bars that the group that has the bipolar diagnosis also have uh, a lot of anxiety symptoms. Uh, and rather one could almost say panic anxiety disorder in addition to their disruptive behavior. Um, the, the Massachusetts General Hospital group uh, have pioneered uh, use of uh, medications for very young children and uh, a open label eight week trail of risperidone versus olanzapine. However, there's no placebo. On 31 preschoolers aged four to six, found a rapid reduction of symptoms of mania in preschool children. There was a marked rise in prolactin, in fact the weight gain was 10% and 15% respectively for the two drugs. The next slide actually, uh, and you can stop if you want to is a uh, commercial that appeared during Outlaw Star, of course on the Cartoon Network.

00:12:30
DR. PETER PARRY The next slide it uh, is of uh, the next 10 year review which happened 8 years after the previous one in the American Academy of Journal. Uh, by uh, and this was by Pavulluri, Bernvor(ph), and Naylor. And they pointed out in fact, these two phenotypes appeared in bipolar. Narrow phenotype where the children have to have some degree of elevated mood stage. And they broad phenotype were they need not have that, but irritability is the for mount feature. Uh, it was mentioned that uh, the National Institute of Mental Health research round table on pre-pubertal pediatric bipolar sort of accepts these concepts and that they may make it in the DSM-V. So, it's not surprising that with this kind of uh, backing literature that uh, the diagnosis started to rise. And Blater and Carlson uh, found uh, that the rise had been quite dramatic particularly in Afro-American children amongst new patients. And a paper by Moreno et al, in Archive Gen Psychiatry, in September 2007 actually made quite uh, uh, made headlines in the American General Media when it showed that there been a 4,400% rise in the diagnosis on an outpatient basis uh, to essential to general practitions in the United States, who have to make diagnosis for health insurance purposes. Between the years '94, '95, to 2002, 2003, and the trajectory of that line is listed here. Uh, fueling this was a uh, a best-selling book uh, "The Bipolar Child", by Demitri and Janice Papolos. Which is featured on programs like Oprah Winfrey. Uh, next slide is from the Journal of Bipolar Research Foundation, which uh, set up by uh, Dr. Papolos. And uh, to study bipolar disorder in very young children. And from page 14 of the Bipolar Child three very young cases are described. Uh, cases inutro. And you might like to just uh, pause me and read those. But when babies born uh, apparently you can buy baby-wear to uh, to fit. But uh, when babies born uh, apparently you can buy baby-wear to uh, to fit. There's quite a genre of parent's self-help books. Uh, for instance Bipolar, ADHD, and then there's posters for the uh, school office, pediatric bipolar disorder also known manic depression, is a genetic neuro-biological illness that can emerge in childhood. And the other one here is uh, an online questionnaire that can be taken uh, and this is about elation. Jean is feeling kind of kind of silly and giddy. And all she can do is think of funny things that can make her laugh. Sometimes, Jenny feels silly like this she can't stop laughing even at the office told her to stop. How often do you feel like this if you're a school girl? Pediatric, uh, there was uh, uh, rich magnet the colors of blue and orange. Blue representing depression, orange representing mania, and the gradation the moods in between. A genre of children's self-help books such as, "My Roller Coaster Feelings" help book and "Brandon the Bipolar Bear", "Sassy Daisy", and the "Firefly Festival", etc. So, Robert here is uh, feeling kind of silly, giddy, and goofy according to his doctor or bouncing of walls according to his parents. Goes to the supermarket with mom, asks for candy, says, please. Mom says, no, chucks the candy at mom. Embarrassing her in front of all those people. At night he doesn't just get a little bit sacred, he gets terrified. He can't help it. His brain goes in fast motion, like a moving fast forward. The dad says, look other kids got asthma and diabetes and chuck so does he. "Brandon", Dr. Samuel said, "I want to tell you something." Brandon sat close to his mother, careful to not hurt his bear's broken arm. "You have a bipolar disorder", the doctor said. "Bi- what?", asked Brandon as he watched his feet swishing back and forth through the air. "Bipolar disorder", repeated Dr. Samuel, "You see the way we feel is controlled by chemicals in our brain." Brandon wonders if he's just been bad. I think may be he had. But the book uh, receives some positive reviews and uh, it should be on the prime school curriculum. So, there began some doubt and decent in the American psychiatric literature. And the first of these starters was between Professor Beiderman and uh, and for the neg-, for the affirmative that mania is mistaken for ADHD in pre-pubertal children. For the negative was Klein et al. I'm just going to go through the items of Klein et al. That they said, well look the phenomenology of this pediatric bipolar is so different than adults with bipolar. Previous epidemiology surveys have shown pre-pubertal cases to be exceedingly rare. And they said that the fact that uh, that Beiderman's uh, research showed a 99% specificity and sensitivity uh, between the child psychiatrist and the, the trained, the interviewers using questionnaires cast some doubt in the validity. In contrast within Don Klein, that it is difficult to make the diagnosis. I mean if a lay interviewer uses a questionnaire can make the diagnosis uh, without any, and only miss 1% in cases, and get 1% of cases wrong and I'm no better as a child psychiatrist with 15 years experience as a consultant. Well um, why do they need me. Um, they also pointed out that in fact the rates in the uh, parents of normal children uh, of bipolar disorder was the same as the rates of parents of children with bipolar disorder. Which actually suggest another diagnosis, perhaps a bipolar amongst adults in the U.S. at that time. And they pointed out that the rates of pediatric bipolar in these very young children uh, suggested that um, it must be, if, if they were true then we would expect far greater rates of bipolar disorder in adults, given time and people growing up. So perhaps, there is a real increase in bipolar going up. That, that is a possibility. Uh, 8 years, sorry 5 years after that there was a uh, special issue of Biological Psychiatry, and uh, Biederman was the guest editor and the whole issue was devoted really to pediatric bipolar disorder. Again he pointed out the uh, the strong correlations with trained psychomatecians, being able to diagnose this disorder. That tweaking your child and having your check-list helps detect cases. In fact, 7% of the sample of cams children in Brazil uh, who were pre-pubertal could, could be diagnosed with it by these means. And uh, normal lack of conduct disorder and uh, genetic studies, and uh, neuro-imagining studies uh, and pharmco therapy and psycho-education modules indicated the advances that were happening. The second uh, suppose major stout in, in this controversy occurred in the American Academy Journal in 2005, when treatment guidelines were published by Kowatch et al. These treatment guidelines accepted again by the narrow and broad phenotypes. They highlighted though, the need for comprehensive assessment. When I went through that with my training here in Australia in child and adolescents psychiatry. Though there was no mention of any play based child assessment. And teach reports were simply encouraged not stipulated. Which I thought would of been important for such a serious disorder. Seven pages of pharmaco therapy algorithms followed. And it was half a page of its non-drug therapy. Which primary was therapeutic alliance so that, and in psycho-education so the child would take their medication. Project response by seven pharmaceutical companies in the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation. Very strong proponents of the diagnosis except for perhaps, uh, Carlson. The three nonmedicals of the CIBA. So the American Academy Journal did run a commentary with this and it was by McCellan. And he reiterated the argument of Klein et al from 5 years previously, noticing that the neuro-imaging data was inconclusive and contradictory. And he made this statement, the developmental and family systemic context of children's moods and behavior reflect complex problems interwoven with temperament, attachment, parent-child relationships, cognition, and other moderating, mediating factors including trauma. And inferred that this sophisticated child psychiatric paradigm uh, is lacking in much of pediatric bipolar literature. Uh, he commended Kowatch et al, for limiting the recommendations to age six and older but he finished with this: "the rate of psychotropic agents prescribed to preschoolers is skyrocketing. Labeling tantrums as a major mental illness lacks face validity and undermines credibility in our profession. There was a paper by Harris, um, "Increased Diagnosis of "Juvenile Bipolar Disorder"; What are we treating?" And she's a child psychiatrist, she worked for six months in the Massachusetts General Hospital. And her unit was the um, um, under 13. And a quarter of the children in her care have diagnosis of bipolar and we're receiving medication. And for another quarter the parents wanted the diagnosis and the same medication. She gives two case examples of um, children aged 10 and 11, one who she believed had autism and the other post dramatic stress. And in an email to me she says, "perhaps only one 12 year old truly had bipolar disorder." Many of the cases with a label of juvenile bipolar disorder she wrote, uh, that she disagreed with, tend to have horrendous histories of abuse and neglect. Typically in the foster care system, or in highly disturbed or disruptive families. By 2006, Carlson and Meyer had written a paper in the Journal on Development and Psychopathology. Where they pointed out that pediatric bipolar uh, that age appropriate affect regulation, mostly children doesn't appear to have ever been acquired, in that sense, a developmental disorder. And different from classical manic depressive disorder which Meyer hints disrupts mood regulation by the nature of the illness. They pointed out that," these children, and indeed adults need to be better understood and not simply lumped together because in the cross section they all have symptoms of mania." And they finished with a quote from uh, an American essayist, uh, "every complex problem has a solution this is simple, neat and wrong." Another paper by Carlson was in the Journal of Affective Disorders, where she took issue with the use of structured interviews and questionnaires, and writing scales for making the diagnosis. And you can read these in more detail. But for instance uh, she points out that the Young Mania Rating Scale doesn't have anything to do with being young, it was devised by Young in 1978. Uh, for actually quantifying but not diagnosing episode of mania in adults for that matter. Uh, and there was no consideration as its designed ways to combat discriminating either ADHD or children with temper tantrums or intermittent explosive disorder or language disorders. And she points out the issues of uh, hypersexuality being uh, categorized as uh, as mania when it could be abuse, for instance. Now in uh, 2000, May 2009 uh, at the privilege of uh, presenting a symposium at the American Psychiatry Association, San Francisco with three colleagues in child psychology from San Francisco, including Professor Glen Elliott. Um, now Glen uh, talked to me about how his whole career had really been looking for very early onset cases of bipolar disorder. This has been his uh, hi career long interest. In our presentation in his talk and he uh, and here's his slide here. He pointed out the differences between adult and child onset of bipolar disorder. And you can read through those, pause me and read through those. Just to see quite the strong differences in the syndromes. So some follow-up studies of the broad phenotype, that's the irritable pediatric bipolar kids showed that it didn't seem to go on to classical bipolar disorder. But they you know, they had psychopathology and depression, or ongoing contact problems. And includes a study by by Phil Hazel from Australia where it will include cohort of adolescent boys uh, I think there was 125 uh, boys with ADHD and 25 of those could be diagnosed with broad phenotype bipolar disorder. Six years later only one of them uh, possible or probably had bipolar. And that lead on to this term, severe mood dysregulation. Coined by Leibenluft colleagues at National Institute of Mental Health. Which effectively rebadges the broad phenotype pediatric bipolar uh, by getting rid of the bipolar word and saying, okay, these are very mood dysregulated kids. In 2007, official American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice Parameters came out. And uh, this is very interesting document, quite a compromised document. As a matter of fact a colleague from Sydney, whom I met at the airport, uh, on my way back from the conference uh, said, it, it you, you read it, you think, oh my goodness. Because part of it is talking about pediatric bipolar as very much a proven diagnosis. And then you get to another section, it says more or less like the next slide, well it probably isn't uh, isn't real. Read that in uh, in a bit more detail. And the reason for that, that is uh, uh, skeptics like uh, McClellan and Carlson were on the committee toward drafting those. The debate spilled over into the uh, adult psychiatric literature. Here in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 2007, saying that this diagnosis is notoriously controversial whether it could be diagnosed in pre-pubertal children at all, is the big issue. And pointing out that its simplistic potential risky symptom-ameiorating polypharmacy is, well, risky. The Canadians uh, they uh, had a look at it with um, uh, guest editorial and a couple of deep papers. And a paper by Duffy uh, was uh, uh, reviewed the studies of offspring of uh, adults who had uh, that no one would dispute uh, clear cut bipolar, manic depression. And found that no cases in these children who are very high risk could be diagnosed under the age of 12. Uh, on the other hand Chang said,"Well looks it's uh, uh, it's a continious disorder uh, starting at a very young age group up into pre-schoolers. One thing that was becoming apparent to me was there was a disconnect in the literature because my main interest in child psychiatry around developmental psychopathology and attachment theory. And as I read through this stuff, pediatric bipolar, I just really didn't see it mentioned much. And uh, developmental neurobiology for instantaneous is a large and growing field with the work of uh, Allan Schore in kind of collating a lot of this. Informed by attachment theory is based firmly in infant-mother, carer observation studies. And more recently it's been uh, given I suppose great uh, um, empirical weight by the use of neuro-imaging techniques. And, and the thing about some of this research it's starting to be able to predict both normal and abnormal brain function and uh, relating it to the degree of care that the infant is receiving. And here's some books for instance, Affect Dsyregulation, Affect Regulation, The Neuroscience of Human Relationships. So, what one finds in this research, in developmental neurobiology is that attachment trauma causes underactivity and inhibited growth of the, of the right orbital prefrontal cortex. This kind of part of your brain. And impaired integration of uh, your right uh, frontal areas with the right lympic system uh, like the amygdala and areas like insula and anterior cingulate. And with hippocampus and a hyper-reactivity of the right amygdala. And the, the right frontal lobe is about uh, uh, a sense of self, a sense of containment. And the amydgala is your uh, fight-flight-flee response system. So if you've got underdeveloped sense of being able to be contain yourself and you're on edge uh, you know, post-traumatic kind of sense uh, then you might be surprised your moods drop up and down, and uh, if your behavior is very defensive. So, then one looks at neuroimaging uh, a paper on neuroimaging for bipolar children that was published in the American Academy Journal in March 2009 by Pavilluri and colleagues. And their conclusion was increased of to mid to low activations observed in patients with pediatric bipolar. And furthermore, um, there was under activity of the right frontal lobe. So excellent research in Pavilluri's paper. However, to me my way of reading it is, it seemed to lack the explanatory biopsychosocial developmental contexts of the developmental neurobiology literature. And so, if one, you know, just uh, gets the pdf. and puts the find function on and looks for terms like: attachment, abuse, trauma, neglect they, they weren't in the paper. So, I followed this uh, line of inquiry by doing my own literature um, search. I gathered uh, 718 papers that seem to be from the top 70 authors in attachment, developmental psychology, trauma, neurobiology literature, they were missing pediatric bipolar. Only three of those uh, well three of 721 papers uh, actually mentioned the term. I and colleague Steve Allison uh, further conducted a uh, survey of child and adolescent psychiatrist in Australia and New Zealand, 2007. One of the comments we got back was this: "From presentations I have attended at international conferences, the 'big names' in this area of research, pediatric bipolar, are not taking attachment issues into account. So the attachment theory uh, model taking the pediatric bipolar into account, is the pediatric bipolar not taking attachment into account. Well, uh, one can gather again you know, the top uh, 70 or so authors uh, on the pediatric bipolar literature by using scopus search engine. For instance finds Professor Biederman leads with 135 papers. Attachment is mentioned in two of those papers and in both of those papers it's in the title and the reference, not in the body of the text. And you can have, you can pause me and have a look at the next few slides to see how often these words or terms are mentioned in uh, those papers. That mainly come from the Massachuesetts General Hospital. Coming to the slide uh, that uh, uh, there were 244 papers from the Massachuesetts General Hospital and Harvard and only seven papers mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder. And they effectively conclude that children are born with bipolar are different to pair into the causes, stress, and trauma in the family which then causes post-traumatic stress in the child. And uh, when one looks at a, a list of the leading 32 authors, who all had over 34 publications uh, that appeared from scopus search to applied to pediatric bipolar then um, uh, was the word attachment used as a theme. Well, in only four of 1,192 publications. Looking at the narrow phenotype pediatric bipolar literature in terms of that which emanates in Washington University, Saint Louis, only two papers mentioned sexual abuse uh, out of 50 and no papers mentioned attachment or trauma, or any other abuse terms were noted. Now just to uh, sort of change in text slightly here. Um, mindless and brainless psychiatry uh, terms coined back in 1985 by Szasz. And uh, probably most eloquently put an address to the Canadian Psychiatric Association by Lipowski. And there was uh, a lot of uh, brainless psychiatry going on in the 20th century when psycho-analysis and family therapy over uh, stated that, you know, that their claims and uh, diagnosis at kind of one point just sort of didn't happen. Uh, but one could say all the pendulum swung to far to mindless psychiatry. And that's what Lipowski was fearing as the development of the brain in the 1990's was perhaps born. So we just changed tact a bit here but still very much keeping to the controversy theme. And have a look at the American public media. The first array into this in a big way was the cover story to Time in 2002. And I remember actually reading this at the time because obviously it's international uh, magazine. And just been completely puzzled. I couldn't make out what the heck it was all about. Um, and uh, particularly when they started talking about uh, uh, babies in the womb having uh, symptoms of bipolar. The American public media became rather skeptical. Uh, and more investigative around the issue uh, following the tragic death of Rebecca Riley in the Boston region of the United States, uh, in December 2006 at the age of 4. She had been diagnosed with ADHD and pre-pubertal pediatric bipolar at age 28 months. She was under three psychiatric medications: clonidine, Quetiapine, and Valproate. The parents allegedly gave her decongestants because she had a cold and extra clonidine to make her sleep. And she died.

DR. PETER PARRY And uh, the parents shown on the next slide. Uh, the mother has uh, this is now February, 2010, the mother has been in jail I think without bail for most of that time, as is the father. The father is on a first-degree murder charge, the mother's on a second-degree. And the mother has just been convicted with 15 years without parole. Their defense lawyer though argued about, uh, or raised questions about the psychiatrist who prescribed the medication for Rebecca and diagnosed at such a young age. Another prominent story was on the cover of Newsweek, a boy called Max and this was in May of 2008. Again it was in news stands here in Australia. Max is age 10, he had symptoms since birth. He was diagnosed just after his second birthday in Boston. And he'd been on 38 psychiatric medications in his life. His mother pointed out, uh, if you go to the Newsweek website you can actually see a little video clip of his mother speaking. And she points out that in fact, in the last six months, Karate and horse-riding had helped more than anything. Extremely more than these 38 psychiatric drugs. And uh, in the uh, the article you read how in uh, uh, he was prescribed Valproate called Depakote in America. Uh, but then wouldn't eat or couldn't sleep. He was turning two so he was prescribed Zypresa or lanzapine, an antipsychotic known to be highly sedative and to increase appetite and it had both of those effects. So he was sleeping like a baby. Here's a picture of Max. So, following the death of Rebecca Riley, Boston Globe had a running saga uh, in its pages. And what they unearthed was that there had, there was a liteny of notifications of abuse to the local social services. This then lead to some interviewing of child psychiatrist and adult psychiatrist, pediatricians about pediatric bipolar and about medicating very young children. Now on the next few pages, uh, few slides I've got exerts of from the media. Those in green in a sense in favor of the practice of diagnosing very young and medication very young in order to treat the disorder early. And those in red uh, are um, uh, against this diagnosis, it's usually inappropriate, it's usually wrong, and medicating risk out weigh the benefits. Uh, but as you can read through those in your own time you'll see that uh, some of the language uh, actually is uh, not what would make it into the academic literature any way.

DR. PETER PARRY So just pause me and perhaps read through those. And by that time The New York Times is um, is talking talking about this. Uh, we have uh, Professor Carlson who is a Professor from New York, saying we're just inundated with stuff from drug companies, publications, throw-aways that tell us six ways from Sunday that oh my God we're missing bipolar. Pavuluri from Pediatric Mood Disorders in Chicago, on the other hand says, "Look these are kids that have rage, anger, bubbling emotions that are just intolerable for them. And it's good that this is finally being recognized as part of a single disorder." Now, I just like to say something at this point. Last year, I went to the American Academy conference in Hawaii. And I attended a session by Dr. Pavuluri about pediatric bipolar. And I and others asked from the floor, well, uh, you're presenting lots of interesting stuff, especially the neuroimaging uh, research. But why necessary call these troubled uh, children as bipolar. Couldn't you just say, these are children with severe emotional and behavioral problems. And uh, she did concede that uh, there was merit in what we were saying. But if she were to put uh, forward applications for grants for research and not include uh, bipolar as the diagnosis then those grants would far less likely uh, to have come through. Huh, the there's an article in the New Yorker uh, which quotes Geller, uh, Professor Hymen who is a former Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, and uh, Hewitt who is a child psychologist. Who describes our practice now as undiagonizing bipolar. And Blumberg as psychotherapist, who was once Vice President ABC motion pictures, implicated wider social influences and the role of the pharmaceutical company in over medicalizing childhood. And again you can read through these. Uh, uh, but Hymen for instance says, we're going to have hell to pay in terms of side effects. Geller from the narrow pediatric bipolar camp is uh, pointing out deficits in the uh, uh, Papolos and uh, broad phenotype uh, bipolar camp research. And Prewitt describes a case where a boy called Max, uh, presumably not the one covered by Newsweek, And uh, as Blumberg states uh, uh, in psychiatric advertising and advertisements are designed to make us frenetic, to make frenetic driven parents who are insecure about behavior of their children. Whether he's right or wrong? But that's his opinion. 60 Minutes then ran a, that's the American 60 Minutes not ours. Uh, uh, "What killed Rebecca Riley?", "Bipolar: Dangerous Diagnosis?" And interviews were heard with Biederman, McClellan, parents of the boy who had diagnosis but then it was removed after a couple of weeks in McClellan's unit. And Rebecca Riley's mother Caroline who was in jail. And it's worth watching it's a 15 minute segment, and you can Google it and find it, and I've got the link there. uh, Bierderman was quoted as saying, the average age of onset is about four in pre-school years. We saw something similar which was uh, the Medicated Child documentary which comes from the American Public Broadcasting Service. It was shown on SBS,on The Cutting Edge series, in March 2008. Uh, and Associate Professor Williams, uh, child and adolescent psychiatrist from Texas, uh, wrote in the Los Angles Times describing a case of a 10 year old boy with "bipolar" was put on eight psychiatric medications with no signs or symptoms of bipolar in her opinion. And I think what's important thats she was pointing out, stuff that's kind of difficult to, to uh, get published in the academic literature uh, because it's kind of more anecdotal about you've done these practices. And she points out as, you can read it through in its entirety but that uh, parents will turn up because they have seen an advertisement that says that children should be on such and such medication for their uh, their behavior. Uh, the United States has direct consumer advertising of prescription drugs. That uh, because of the American health system uh, doctors spend all their time on the phone with uh, paperwork due to insurance companies. And when I was in San Francisco, I was talking to a child psychiatrist there who said for every one minute she spends in clinical time she spends one minute dealing with health insurance companies, 50% of the time is spent just trying to get payment. Again in Hawaii uh, presenter answered our survey, from the Australian New Zealand child psychiatrist that was very skeptical of the American position. It had a bit of interest from the American colleagues, most of whom were on one side, actually. And uh, one was pointing out that she sees uh, uh, a child with mental problems. About 50, it depends on insurance company but with some insurance companies she's got to get on the phone within about 15 minutes on phone and negotiate the payment for session in order to see how many more sessions she can have. And she says if she says just parent child problem. Now a parent child problem is actually an induce diagnosis on the V-codes, uh, then she won't get paid. If she says adjustment disorder, which she might get a couple of sessions and some payment. If she says bipolar disorder, she'll get paid more and get more sessions to do with much less problems. 

00:45:40

00:45:45
DR. PETER PARRY And uh, anyway. Williams says, the American people need to take responsibility for health not expect pills to solve everything. So, the Onion, we finally made the Onion in March 2009. That's a satire called Online Newspaper. And uh, it found uh, it reported a study uh, showing that 98% of babies have manic depression. And uh, in all of this uh, had some email correspondence with uh, 15 to 20 American colleagues. A professor Rosenlichts from California is actually an adult psychiatrist, uh but in this next slide you can see he talks about the problem of disorder inflation and the inference of pharmaceutical industry on CME. And Ronald Brown who, who is the Dean at uh, one of the universities and editor of the Journal of Pediatric Psychology, points out with some insurance companies the only thing they reimburse for is prescribing There's little or no therapy. The next slide shows some concerning statistics. Uh, for instance um, the, the American media reporting that uh, in the month of Ohio, sorry, in the state of Ohio and for the month of July 2004, 18 children aged between birth and three uh, had been prescribed antipsychotics and 28 more in the same age group were on antidepressants. Uh, something that was actually so well reported in San Francisco, the American Psychiatric Association Conference um, was the uh, about the foster children study in Texas where just over three-quarters of the whole medication voucher was going on psychiatric drugs. Um, what was really worrying I thought was this statistic of 400 foster children were requiring antidsykinetics. In other words perhaps getting extra gram of side effects caused by antipsychotics they were on. And then in USA Today and New York Times um, went to look to the FDA online um, adverse drug events reporting uh, database. Uh, which I've looked at myself, so I know what kind of research they did but it's very laborious because that data is kept in a very rawed out form. You've got to troll through uh, thousands of reports. And they found that um, 45 uh, there were 45 reports of deaths to children where the primary suspect according to the reporting doctor was an atypical psychotic between the years 2000 and 2004. And in 2006 alone there were 29 similar cases. And for Risperdal there were 31 cases over the four reporting time. This is given some academic literature that support by a paper by Moore et al in Archives Internal Medicine, uh, where they did, I, my email conversation with them and the journalist, it sounds like the same kind of methodology in, in finding these. And unfortunately uh, in one way, Moore et al didn't actually look at this in terms of age group. They just hadn't done it that way and were unable to tell me how many children and adolescents. But psychiatric drugs were in the top 15 in um, prime suspects as the cause of death; clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and paroxetine. And the others in the top 15 were generally opoiods and antineoplastic agents which you would kind of expect there for people, you know, who have got eternal illnesses. This paper by Wonodi raises this uh, severe concerns about uh, the second-generation antipsychotics perhaps not being as sage in, in um, terms of Tardive Dsykinesia. The external side effect that occurs with long-term antipsychotic treatment. Uh, because uh, they had been promoted as uh, given far lower rates of dsykinesia than the older first-generation antipsychotics. They certainly seemed to do that. If you just pause me and read through the slide. But they're still um, awaring amount of cases. 6% of um, of this very small cohort of kids had been on drugs at uh, second, uh second-generation antipsychotic for over six months had developed dsykinesia. Um, the next slide shows how some of the State's legislatures in the United States were bringing in uh, um, kind of watch dog programs to check on doctors who seem to be prescribing uh, too many medications. And when Florida brought in a law uh, requiring authority prior to, authority pre-approval for scripts uh, for under six uh, age group then suddenly all the babies who were getting scripts uh, didn't need any. And you can look through that table. I've thrown in here a slide by um, um, Molly Burke, who, who was one of my co-presenters at the American Psychiatric Association meeting. And she just uh, quoted a mother who's somewhat upset about uh, her child having had the diagnosis and a lot of medication. 

00:51:10
[sil.] 

00:51:15
DR. PETER PARRY There is a book, "Creating the Bipolar Child", which is a series of essays that are generally quite critical of the diagnosis. And chapter four of that is by a Robert Whitaker, um, entitled "How our drug-based paradigm of care is fueling an epidemic of disabling mental illness in children. And his theory was that because there was high rates of prescribing of the psychostimulants like Ritelin and the SSRIs like floxetine um, that this was perhaps precipitating younger cases of manual mood disregulation. I'm not sure about that theory but that is his theory. Um, so, uh, then the New York Times had a look at the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession. Which of course is quite a hot topic of the last few years. And uh, Melissa DelBello um, from the University of Cincinnati uh, uh, she is uh, when I did that literature search I think she was uh, the second highest author to Biederman uh, um, in terms of number of papers. And she was asked how much she was paid by AstraZenca because she reported on a study that um, that she had uh, overseen for AstraZenca. And she said, "Trust me I don't make much." Um, however, the journalist didn't trust her. Six weeks later The New York Times uh, reported that a disclosure form was indicated that she'd earned 100 thousand in 2003 and 80 thousand in 2004 from AstraZenca. And she consulted for other drug makers as well. And professor Biederman and his colleagues uh, made headlines in The New York Times uh, for not reporting uh, a round about $4 million between the three of them uh, that they had received uh, in consultant fees and things like that um, for pharmaceutical companies. And you may not be aware but there have been a series of uh, law cases involving pharmaceutical companies. Which uh, to which internal industry documents have been subpoena uh, and that in fact uh, large companies have been fined and settled out of court for large sums of money. And uh, some of these documents uh, are now freely, publicly available on the internet. And uh, a colleague of mine Glen Speerman and I published a paper in the Journal by inquiring on some of these documents. Which I will show you a few just here. That seemed to be kind of related to bipolar disorder as the title. In August 2001, for Eli Lilly uh, it's uh, a mania psychiatric drug Prozac, its patent was going to expire which is know why we can prescribe generic clozapine. Uh, just a month before that or a week before that in fact there was uh, a meeting at some executive level within Eli Lilly and there was a Power Point presentation here. The company's betting the farm on Zyprexa. Now that kind of paid off that bet, $40 billion in sales between '96, its launch and 2009. Minus 2.7 billion, it's actually 2.8 billion now in lawsuit settlements. He also included that point I should update this slide. The largest criminal fine in history, half a billion dollars. The largest criminal fine in history now is against a fellow pharmaceutical company, Phizer. And uh, here's another slide about how their going to expand the market for Zyprexa by redefining how primary care physicians, that's GP, identify, diagnose and treat complicated mood disorder or mood. And to do that is the next slide shows uh, one they change their paradigm with continued medical education. To be a leader in the bipolar market, Zyprexa will need to be viewed as a true mood stabilizer. A true mood stabilizer working just like lithium in preventing onset of depression, preventing onset of manic episodes. And if it could be sold as a depicoat like mood stabilizer, as the next slide shows, they were forecasting large sales, which in fact they, I think they probably exceeded. However, the Swat analysis on the next slide shows that around that time that they were hoping to do that they actually had weaknesses. And one of those was they only had acute mania data for indication of launch. And they lacked data on maintenance or depression. Timeline on next slide is about uh, the roll-out hopefully of bipolar indications and to generate the bipolar data needed. Next slide, must have bipolar indication to explode, create a market. And reported in The New York Times, March 2008, was an email by the current Eli Lilly CEO, uh, "The fact we are now talking to child psychiatrist and pediatricians and others about Strattera." Which is a anti-ADHD medication. "Means that we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population." Now, I just have to say something here, uh, a pharmaceutical company is a business and they're trying to um, you know, get the best for they're bottom line and their share holders. And uh, and for their profit margin. And so, the ethics for a CEO running a business are different from the ethics for the medical profession, for journal editors, and for scientific researchers. Uh, I just think it's an important point to make. The next slide is uh, uh, from uh, some of the uh, prosecutor's transcript uh, in the State of Montana suing Jansen and AstraZeneca without payments to researchers and key opinion leaders. And there's some embarrassing stuff there, which I'll let you read for yourself. So, um, The New York Times ran an editorial um, that was highly critical of Professor Biederman and his relationship with one of the pharmaceutical companies. That pharmaceutical company made Risperdal uh, and it was involved in an alliance with a set-up, pediatric psycho-pharmacology research program. And the next slide talks about the three criteria. Um, of the center, its aims where, first two were admirable to improve psychiatric care of children to meet high levels of scientific quality. And a third to move forward with the commercial goals of Johnson and Johnson. And um, then it's about the data, that data needs to be generated because otherwise clinicians and I suppose he's talking about clinicians like myself. My question, the wisdom of the quest be treating children with medication, especially those with neuroleptics which expose children to uh, um, side-effects, etc. The next slide points out the rationale of the center is to generate in somewhat raw data used to supporting the use of Risperdal in this patient population. Couple of slides that follow um, raised issues of possible ghost-writing and uh, raised an issue that why in one of the emails it seemed the placebo was actually doing quite well but in the published abstract the placebo did not seem to be doing as well. Of course, these are just questions that um, were raised in the media about these documents that come to mind. Um, professor Biederman defended himself uh, in letters to the Boston Globe and to the Wall Street Journal and in sum, that he had uh, been paid to was in fact for research and not for um, salary. In this next slide is really just um, showing the paper by uh, Glen and I, on the internal industry documents that I uh, got drawn to look at on the internet by following uh, this subject, pediatric bipolar. Next slide comes from Professor Felix Boxner, who's professor of pharmacology at uh, Adddely University and he taught me at medical school. He came to the World Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatry Congress in Melbourne a couple of years ago. And then there's this slide along with many others, uh, it shows the problem in the conflict of interest between pharmaceutical profession and the medical profession it be noted by Chaucer with his assertive wit, way back in the 14th century. Lexchin and colleagues published in, in a medicine analysis in the British Medical Journal in 2003 which was eight, which was an analysis of 18 review studies of industry sponsored versus independent studies where a sponsor drug was up against either a placebo or comparative drug in a randomized control trial. And what they found was that if studies are sponsored by pharmaceutical company that have a entourage of 4.05 chance of finding in favor of the sponsored drug than if the study is independent. And they talk about a crisis of trust in the academic literature. This was taken up by this extraordinary editorial board commentary with 26 signatures of the Editorial board of the American Journal of Psychiatry in March last year, Conflict of Interest An Issue of Every Psychiatrist. The next slide is uh, kind of by, trying to take the big picture of historical view of this. That what we have with human nature um, and humanity is uh, the problem of neurotic spector of emotional and behavior disturbance and we're looking for a quick fix uh, in a pill be it opium and the opiates uh, bromides. The barbiturates uh, benzodiazepines like valium, and the antidepressants and now the atypical antipsychotics. And given that depression wasn't diagnosed very much in the year of the benzodiazepines but everyone was diagnosed, well possibly were diagnosed with anxiety neurosis. Uh, then antidepression becomes kind of the way capsulating and understanding the diagnosis when antidepressants run patent and those very addictive benzodiasepines are no longer in patent. And now it seems that as the antidepressants like prozac go off patent but this Zyprexa of this roll-out goes on patent that we're seeing far more cases of bipolar disorder down to the age of two. And uh, the atypic psychotics are now finding uh, the label mood-stabilizer um, rather than being called anitpsychotic for treating mania and schizophrenia. Uh, change in tact again. Uh. presentation by professor Gaven Andrews from Sydney at the International Society for Defective Disorders in Brisbane in 2009 was interesting and kindly gave me permission to show some his slides here. And this was uh, one of his working parties toward um, DSM-V and um, and ICD-11. And uh, proposal is that this DSM-V to move from, at this stage it probably won't happen because the science and psychiatry isn't strong enough. But the aim is eventually that we have in those logical system that actually reflects deep science. Uh, in the same way that mythology has a scientific system but it's based on histology, physiology, and uh, the imaging of kidneys. And so, it's not just where the son's gotten nephritic syndrome or nephritis(ph) as syndromes but you can know exactly what's wrong with him. Uh, in psychiatry we say, well he's psychotic or they've just got non-psychotic neurosis. Um, and uh, we just don't have the science yet to delineate things. However, you know, the goal is to get there. The Five Clusters, uh, proposals for neurology is that disorders would be clustered along neuro-cognitive disorders such as delirium and dementias. Neuro-developmental disorders um, autism, mental retardation, language disorders. The psychosis include schizophrenia. So the Five Clusters model which as I said, probably according to the current uh, release of DSM-V task force doesn't sound like it's going to get in. But it's of interest because it's trying to look at psychiatric disorders in a more etiological way. Neuro-cognitive such as delirium and dementias. Neuro-developmental such as autism and mental retardation and language disorders. The psychosis cluster which include schizophrenia, cluster A personality disorders such as schizotypo or schizoid, and paranoid and personality disorders, and bipolar disorder. On the basis that uh, Andrew's presentation um, shows. I'll show you a few more slides in a second. And then the emotional cluster would include PTSD um, and that's like internalizing disorders as well, with the cluster C personality disorders like avoidant and dependent. And externalizing substance use cluster B like borderline personality disorder, impulse control, and conduct disorder. And so perhaps a lot more of what's now being diagnosed soft spectrum bipolar may be divided out to, to emotional, internalizing or externalizing categories. And the next slide is the attributes of these clusters. In the psychosis cluster share biomarkers for stimulus processing deficits. Where as the emotional externalizing clusters um, have temperament, uh, temperamental antecedents uh, and then presumably with environmental stressors and developmental factors, lead one way or the other. Looking at uh, bipolar um, Andrews made uh, the um, argument that it didn't belong in the emotional cluster. That this is bipolar I, and he is very pleased when he got bipolar I. That's leaving full blown mania, not leaving to dispute this is manic depression. And uh, he felt that prolonged according to the evidence that we have. Some of it which is soft some of it which is harder along the 10 attributes from genes, uh, family history, early environment, bio-makers, object processing, the symptoms, core mobilities with other disorders, and the course of illness, etc. That it prolonged closer to psychosis and maybe a cluster on its own. And just released really the last week or so here in February 2010, is the DSM-V Task Force has given um, some indication of what may or may not be in the DSM-V. And it seems the pediatric bipolar disorder at this stage is unlikely to be included in proposed changes to the DSM. And rather a new disorder would be that to temper dsyregulation with dysphoria disorder. Now the thing to like about this is that it uses such lay language that's going to be difficult to rate five to a discrete disease state or entity. Uh, basically you've got kids who can't regulate their tempers, they have temper tantrums and their disparic, their unhappy a lot of the time. Uh, just a couple of slides that show that perhaps there's been overdiagnosing of bipolar disorder in adults. And these both papers both published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. They do make the point this probably a lot of late diagnosing of real bipolar cases um, and some going uh, very late uh, before they're diagnosed. It's tragic in those cases. But also there was overdiagnosing occurring. Around perhaps two-thirds in the study by Goldberg. So, "Bipolar" what's in a name? Is the problem the word 'bipolar'. Are bipolar I and some more serious hypomania bipolar II cases different from bipolar disorder not otherwise not specified and soft bipolar and severe mood dsyregulation. That the word starts to lose meaning when you use bipolar for the whole spectrum. In practice the community and to lesser extent mental health professionals can lose the fine and course distinctions in the over-arching use of the word 'bipolar'. And I just raise this, should we bring back the term 'manic depression' for the severe end. And bring in 'severe regulation' or did this slide before um, DSM-V, which actually seem to be heading that way, temper dsyregulation with dsypharo(ph) disorder. For the less severe of the bipolar II or higher bipolar numbers that have been purposed. So here's my hypothesis um, about what's going on in pediatric bipolar in the U.S. On some 'narrow phenotype' pediatric bipolar appears particular in adolescents to be an antecedent to bipolar disorder later in life. From members that study by Berk et al and Jolan, Noven, um, people who went on to get the full clear cut bipolar. You're talking about onset of manic symptoms in those late teen or 20 years, that weren't fully diagnosed as a manic episode at the time. However, overall there appears to be a high rates of overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder in pediatric age group in the U.S. at that time. And in light of the biopsychosocio and cultural model and sociocultural and economic drivers particularly in the USA. One has to ask the question; is pediatric bipolar to some extent a culture bound syndrome. And this is given I think a little bit more weight by the promising American health system that was highlighted for instance, in Michael Moore's movie, SiCKO. Michael Moore tends to be very political. But it's interesting in this documentary that he didn't have to kind of use hyperbole(ph) um, the facts just spoke for themselves. 

01:10:25
[sil.] 

01:10:30
DR. PETER PARRY And uh, it raises underline philosophical questions that perhaps get neglected in this neurology(ph) that we need to be reminded about. The problem is the informational reductionism. And uh, but this quote um, um, I meant former, a great mentor of mine, um, professor Greg Martin from University of Queensland, who used to be here in Addley. Um, has this on the bottom of his emails: 'Data does not equal information. Information does not equal knowledge and knowledge does not equal wisdom.' So, in quest for evidence-based medicine is above truism has been forgotten. And also that reliability is not the same thing a validity. Do rating scales and questionnaires take precedence over clinical experience. For instance of in-depth case reports and precedence over tradition in research, in journals, and clinical practice. And where are the time consuming child-centered playroom assessments? Information reductionism to my eyes tend to be present in some internal documents relating to the um, Pediatric uh, Psychopharmacology Center at Mass General. Um, this next slide um, is uh, from the Jansen um, Massachusetts General Hospital Child and Adolescents Bipolar Disorder Center, one of their documents. Uh, and to my mind, I think informational reductionism is in play um, because as we read through it center investigators have completed many methodological studies that validate the use of these assessment tools in pediatric populations. Examples include, showing that parent-based diagnosis of ADHD are predictive of teacher-based diagnosis. This work has facilitated drug development for ADHD when teacher reports are lacking. Uh, and really provides reassurance to clinicians when they must diagnosis children without information from teachers. Using clinical trial data to show that parent report is sufficient for detecting efficacy in studies of long-acting medications for ADHD. Providing reassurance to clinicians when they must prescribe trade medication without feedback from teachers. And demonstrating the structural interview diagnosis of child psychopathology show high reliability and diagnostic efficiency. Clarifying the objective nature of diagnosis, which helps clinicians understand the value of applying them in pediatric settings. Now, at the Hawaiian American Academy Conference last year, um, I pointed out in my search on pediatric bipolar disorder that under Medicare and working in public health systems in Addley are under no obligation to provide a diagnosis. Um, and so I can formulate the case along the biopsychosocio lines and uh, uh, take my time coming up with a diagnostic label. If one indeed is ever kind of uh, necessary. Uh, as one tweaks the kind of biopsychosocio systemic factors involved in the child's problem, predicament. Which is a different model I think to, to what's being proposed. And I kind of elaborated on this in uh, paper in the Medical Journal of Australia, uh, in an allegory uh, which I call Cough disorder. And, and really highlighting the issues of not of course, multi-course allity if we find allity. If someone presents the symptoms that you can use an objective checklist and say, "Ah-ha, you've got cough disorder." That doesn't tell you very much. Doesn't tell you whether it's pneumonia or uh, uh, foreign object, or lemonade went down the wrong way, uh, etc. And one has to go further. In fact, in four warns that in its introduction that, that manual is not to be used in a cookbook fashion. When I was first in training in psychiatry in 1990, I remember reading this paper in our Australian New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. Professor Silove is from Sydney, uh, he was actually uh, to the four when a college worked hard to get children related to asylum sick or detention center in the desert. And uh, what he wrote about was a paper called, "Biologism in Psychiatry". A recent study to North America, back then, impressed upon him the seriousness with which Australian psychiatry consider the recent ideological shift in U.S.A. to an extreme model of medical disorders. There's increasing evidence that proponents of this model are not simply promoting the value of biological research with which few psychiatrist would quibble. But the field is at risk of being overwhelmed by reductionist biologism which assumes an organic causation for all abnormal human behavior. And the British Psychologist engaged in a bit of far setting behavior in the cover of their um, monthly magazine, um, with the DSM-IV back in 2007. And also in the United Kingdom the uh, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the NICE guidelines on bipolar disorder published in 2006 had quite a section on bipolar disorders in children and adolescents. And they made it quite clear if a bipolar I criteria should be met for diagnosis in pre-pubertal children and young adolescents due to the risk of misdiagnosis, they felt that pre-pubertal cases were very rare and even adolescent cases were rare. And they caution against over-alliance and questionnaires which would replace a full clinical interview. And of course, again children will probably a couple or more involving play therapy time assessments. And they weren't convinced pediatric bipolar phenotypes have evidence uh, to support their everyday clinical use. Although they are um, important to his research hypothesis. German survey done in 2002 had a 61% response rate. Uh, from, which include reports from 251 child and adolescent psychiatrists and 92% had never diagnosed a pre-pubertal case. And over a third, which was quite striking that um, uh, conservative had never diagnosed an adolescent case. But mind you they were working in outpatient rather than new patients settings. With my colleague Steven Allison and Gary Furber, we published a survey of child and adolescent psychiatrist in Australian New Zealand, and we also had a 60% response rate, so much for the Germans with 199 responders. And similar to the Germans, the mean uh, years of experience in child and adolescent psychiatry was 15 years. And uh, there's a whole heap of slides now that follow, we're up to slide 143 and so there's just under 30 more slides. And all of these are really the results of our survey. And as you look through those you can see we're far more conservative than Americans but not as conservatives as the Germans, and probably not as conservative as the Brits. Only three-and-a-half percent uh, thought that um, didn't think that pediatric bipolar was being overdiagnosed in the U.S.A. And this comment that follow which uh, were published in our faculty e-bulletin that went out, actually available publicly, but I put some of the comments uh, in here. 

01:18:05
[sil.] 

01:18:05
DR. PETER PARRY And if you go to the um, towards the end um, there's a slide by Professor John Werry, who I kind of started uh, this talk with quite some time ago. Um, and he uh, said that uh, he didn't mind this being uh, quoted. Um, all other quotes were anonymous but he, he made his in a direct email. Um, "I do not see any juvenile bipolar disorder below adolescence and I think that the American view is mostly nonsense as do many of my American colleagues." And that's interesting given that he's been a long time proponent of the need to detect and treat early bipolar and other early psychosis in youth. And the final couple of slides before the summary are excerpts from an email conversation I had with a young Boston man, who's currently off all his medications. He's in psychotherapy with a psychiatrist who says he never had bipolar disorder. And he was diagnosed at the age of 12 and he was on medication through the age of 19, his full teenage years. Um, I'll read this but you can turn it off and read it yourself, if you want. I was 12 when I was first diagnosed. It should also be mentioned I come from a screwed-up family and was physically abused in my home by a sibling. Parents divorced young. My mother had a lot of issues,etc. So, it goes without saying there was a lot the psychiatrist I was referred to should have asked about if he was ever so inclined. Within about three months I was on about eight different medications at one time. Very scientific treatment. All the best, several anticonvultants, several antipsychotics, a couple antidepressants, and Lithium, too. I guess the biggest deficit this has left me with is sort of skewing the trajectory of my life so much. My mother feed into my being sick and gained a lot of collateral from it. But worse still, it caused complete neglect of any another possible causes of my problems. And my parents in many ways tended to overinterpert every solitary behavior as part of the disease. Every thing in my life was screened through this filter of this immaterial disease. Many of the arguments in my home with my mother that would land me in the hospital as a teenage began as before, as an argument solely about me wanting to stop my medicines. There's always context. I always had terrible sedation from the anticonvulsants and atypical psychotics. The sedation from valproate was unmanageable and it also had a sort of deadening effect on me. When I was initially on seven or eight drugs, I had terrible tremors and I could not literally think. My head was about as functional as a block of lead. And I had severe memory problems. One very embarrassing problem which at this point I might imagine valproate is involved with, which my psychiatrist certainly never imagined asking about was my pubic hair had begun to fall out. Yep. The amount and frequency that came out was not normal and I am now even more certain it was not good. At that age, I'm also certain you're not suppose to be losing large amounts of pubic hair. Oh well. I also had severe weight gain from my first contact with psychotropics after only four months I gained over 50 pounds. I would subsequently loose it when I would stop the medication myself and then gain it back when I was forced to go back on the medications. This cycle repeated itself five times over eight years. And having almost qualified for the National YMCA swimming championship a year before my diagnosis. I didn't recognize myself as the cow I was forced to become. That specific effect of this was very troubling. I lost control of my body. After one cycle I gained about 85 pounds in less than six months. I had sexual dysfunction from the very beginning that would only abate when I stopped the drugs. Also every SSR drug I happened to be put on at some time or another completely obliveratd my sex drive. They were the worst. I read your papers and letters published in the journals, and I have to tell you it gave me a lot of hope. And sort of made me feel like the world is also a little less crazy. It was exciting and refreshing to read all that. I wish the same could be done over here over here in a more vigorously. So in summary, pediatric bipolar, in particular pre-pubertal cases are notoriously controversial. Pre-pubertal cases are traditionally rare to non-existent. Research for bipolar antecedents is laundable. Uh, shifting criteria has created an epidemic of pediatric bipolar of tow phenotypes. There's controversy now between proponents of the two phenotypes. Severe mood dysregulation or more likely temper dysregulation with dsyphoria may replace broad phenotype, and to some extent the narrow phenotype. Lacking, lack of longitudinal evidence that pre-pubertal pediatric bipolar goes on to typical adult bipolar. There seems to be a disconnect in the literature between phenomenological pediatric bipolar literature and attachment traumatology narrative literature. And the influence of big pharma is a concern. Diagnostic upcoding in the U.S.A. is a socioeconomic driver. And as uh, former Director of National Institute of Mental Health in the U.S.A said, "There will be hell to pay in side effects for use of these big gun medications in young children." Diagnose is still relatively confined to the U.S.A, but there's emergence elsewhere. And one must ask uh, where is he biopsychosocial model. Thank you.
