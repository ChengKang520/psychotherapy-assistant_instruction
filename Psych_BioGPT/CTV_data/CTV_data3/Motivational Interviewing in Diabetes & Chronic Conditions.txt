Motivation Interviewing in Diabetes and Chronic Conditions 

00:00:15
Stephen Rollnick PhD 

00:00:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Well, good morning, and welcome to this brief seminar on Motivational Interviewing in Diabetes Care. And my name is Stephen Rollnick. And I'm of the co-founders of Motivational Interviewing. I'm a clinical psychologist by background. And I've worked in and out of your field for many years, mostly doing research and training practitioners. I've got here a picture for you of my little son, And which has a story attached to it, so I'll come back to that in a moment. But what's the aim of this seminar? I think it's probably best to say, I'm going to teach you about Motivational Interviewing, rather than how to do it. The latter requires a lot more training and practice, but I'm hoping that you'll leave the seminar and head out there and reflect about your practice and learn from your patients. And if you are interested in learning about Motivational Interviewing, to get the support of a coach or trainer or a supervisor, but my task will be to give you a good feel for the spirit and practice of Motivational Interviewing. And to that end, I'm gonna be a bit bold and brave and you might say, a bit foolhardy because I've got an actor lined up. And we haven't rehearsed the scenarios, and her name is Jeanine(ph), she's gonna play the case of Doreen. And I'll introduce you to her in a moment. And after we've done each of four little brief interviews, maybe I'll reflect about my disasters and victories with you, with these really completely unrehearsed practice consultations. So I assume you have slides at your disposal. And do forgive me if I glance down at my computer to make sure that I'm on the right slide, that'll happen from time to time. And the first one should be about this little boy. So let me tell you the story. That's my son Nathan. And like many patients, and like many situations that we face, he's facing behavior change. Should I do something for the first time, which is go into a cool French lake, it was when we were on holiday last year, or should I not go in. And he's very uncertain about behavior change. Now the question is what happened next to Nathan? And what is the best way to help somebody who's feeling ambivalent to make a change? Well, I'm gonna show you on the next slide, what did and didn't happen. So there you can see me beseeching Nathan to go into the water, you can see some other people trying to make other folks stay calm so that it's nice for Nathan to come in. And the question that I put to now is do you think he came in? And how do you feel about the position of my body in relation to helping someone change? So I'll break the news to you now that he refused, point blank, and no one could coax into the water. And the question I wanted to pose to you was what physical position do you think would be best, in relation to Nathan, if I did want to succeed? If I went behind him, I think you'll agree with me that he would probably feel even more frightened because he'd be scared I'd push him. And I don't think it would take us long to discuss and agree that the best position would have been to be alongside him, holding his hand, making him feel bold enough to take steps himself, but to be there alongside him to support him. And in that metaphor is much of Motivational Interviewing. So I'm hoping you'll remember that, that image of him. And in the next picture I've got, you'll see a close up of the same boy umm… with someone whom I wanted to introduce you to, who is William R Miller, who is the co-founder of Motivational Interviewing with me. So that's a picture of Boland and little Nathan, just to give you a feeling for the faces behind all the words and fancy titles. Okay, so let's have a look at what we gonna do today. We're gonna start with this question about why is it so difficult to encourage change in other people. I'm then gonna turn to something called the righting reflex and its relationship to ambivalence. Slightly fancy words, those, but I bet you, you'll get it. And I'll be doing a demonstration with Doreen in that section. That should take us no more than about half an hour so that I can spend the laest hour on the third and most important topic which is Motivational Interviewing. So that gives you a feeling for what we're gonna cover. And first of all, why is it that we so commonly encounter, not just in the diabetes field, the situation where you would really like to encourage someone change, but you're not convinced they agree with you. And here a couple of examples from outside of your field, just to give you a feeling for the breadth of this challenge. And it has, it has us thinking, well, you'd think that you'd want to say to this patient or person, having been disciplined twice for misconduct at work would be enough to persuade someone to do anything possible to protect their career and livelihood. And yet they don't seem to see it that way. Or here we have another that you'd think that someone experiencing hangovers, damaged relationship, car crashes, memory blackouts would be enough to convince someone to stop drinking, but no. We often find it difficult to persuade them. And in the next slide, we have the world that we're talking about today. Surely, the threat of blindness, and amputations, and kidney failure would be enough to motivate someone to lose weight and get better glycemic control, surely. And then there's the most extreme one of all, which is surely time spent in the dehumanizing environments of prisons would be enough to persuade someone not to re-offend, and yet they do. And everything we're gonna be speaking about today is geared towards clarifying how we might succeed better with exactly this kind of challenge. Now I want to start off by pin-pointing the attitude we take towards patients. And I've got this rather strange heading here called what goggles do you wear? I like the metaphor of goggles because you can change glasses and they can also be misty and opaque and even dark or light and bright. And I'm assuming we've got the right glasses on and they're nice and light and bright. But when we see patients, what is our, what is our attitude towards them? In other words, what goggles are we wearing? What lenses do, do we see them through? And on this slide are two paragraphs. And I want you to read and I'll read with you, just the first one. That's the one I ask you some questions about it. 46, female, 2 children… Imagine you got a referral like this. 46, female, 2 children, second marriage, Type II diabetes, poor control, obese for many years, leads an inactive life, moderate to heavy drinker, smoking, diet that's high in fried food, and little or no fruit and vegetables. Now imagine that on a referral letter or let's put it this way, imagine seeing three people like that in a row, how would you feel? And that's the key question. When you read or hear a description of a human being like that, how does it make you feel? And I would like to suggest that the goggles that are being viewed through, with that description, will have probably made you sigh, with the weight of problems that this person has and the very real difficulty of trying to make headway with any one of them. It's what we used to call a heart-sink patient. Your heart sinks and this is my no means extreme in your world, I know that. Okay, that's that pair of goggles. Now I want you to have a look with me at the second paragraph. And then I'm gonna ask you the same questions. So I'll read it. Her name is Doreen and she's an account manager and mother of two. And she's quite a strong, well determined person. It's her second marriage and she keeps a very keen eye on the well-being of those two kids. And it's generally a happy house. They work and they play hard. Mostly, she feels okay with her diabetes. As she's got lots of friends. They smoke and drink in a pub or a club or whatever. And okay, she doesn't get much exercise. She likes to make sure, she's a real carer, Doreen. She likes to make sure that everyone has a good filling meal and this often means fried food. Okay, so now how does it make you feel about seeing Doreen? Because I think by now you've realized that these are the same people. It's just that the first one was described through one set of lenses and the second one was described quite differently. And my guess is the fact that this is a live human being with a well rounded personality and an interesting and diverse life makes you feel happy about seeing Doreen than it would that bland pathology ridden description that we started with. And these are the two types of, of, of goggles that I'm suggesting we might look at people through. Motivational Interviewing doesn't stand a chance if you're not wearing the second pair of goggles. You'll forgive me while I just have the odd sip, please. It's a hot afternoon where I am, okay? And so in this next slide, I've tried to capture this. For helping people and for Motivational Interviewing to make any headway, probably the biggest shift that I've noticed practitioners taking and taking well to, is from not just viewing people as having a series of weaknesses or problems, but having strengths and we picked up quite a few of those strengths in that account of Doreen. And I guess the most fundamental of all is that we're taking with people, not just collections of problems. And I put down here on this slide, Steve's chronic disease, a personal story. Let me tell you briefly, I'm in remission with a chronic disease, the nature which is not important. One day I decided that I wanted to come off my tablets. And I thought I'll wait until I go for my routine check up, which I did and I saw a very well intentioned junior doctor who was following his algorithms and his procedures, I raised the subject to the tablets and he absolutely said, "We don't advise this." I felt umm… a bit stupid for raising it and I was pretty nervous in the consulting room. And frankly, it was with relief that I walked out of there afterwards. Then a few weeks later, I remembered that there was a nurse that I had seen in that clinic and I gave her call and I introduced myself, not sure if she remembered me, but I started developing a relationship with her on the telephone, that was, had a completely different feel to it. And when I explained, as a person, not just as, as, as a, a patient with a pathology, why I wanted to drop these tablets, she was truly wonderful. And I decided to drop it and she agreed the risk was worth taking maybe. And if it wasn't, to phone her back straight away, didn't have a relapse. And I haven't taken the tablet since. Now, this wasn't diabetes, but the disease is not important. The important thing is, for me, was that here was human being, a practitioner with expertise, just like the doctor, I don't mean to be anti-medical here at all, but she treated me as a person and she listened to me and that made a huge difference. That's what I've been trying to say. Okay. So you can see I've got through that first section of our seminar ending with a passionate personal statement about my own progress through chronic disease. Umm… I want to turn now to what is called the righting reflex and the concept of ambivalence. So now we're going, we've got the right goggles on, hopefully they're nice and clear, they're strength based and they view to review these patients as people with strengths, okay. Now we're faced with a scenario where they come into our consulting rooms and we think it's wise for them to change their behavior, just like Doreen. What is the righting reflex? It's a term I came up with to describe a very understandable inclination that we have to see a problem in someone else and fix it. And in many aspects of medical, healthcare, domestic life, education, the righting reflex is essential and really important. However, what I noticed was that the almost reflex use of see problem, fix it, when it comes to behavior change in healthcare, smoking, drinking, diets, whatever, leads to trouble. And this was the observation that Miller first made when he developed Motivational Interviewing, which was that, if someone is feeling uncertain or ambivalent about changing, and they're met with the righting reflex, something happens inside them that reacts against it. They hear the voice, the case for change being made by us. And it seems like an essential part of human nature that when someone does that, you feel perhaps your autonomy is being a little undermined. And in your mind, what emerges is the arguments to counter it, and you either think it or you also say it to the person. And there unfolds a rather dysfunctional pattern of communication which was what gave rise to Motivational Interviewing. So I thought what I would do to begin with, is demonstrate the use the righting reflex. And we've got this rather flexible case of Doreen here and I've asked Doreen to, to walk in as if she's somebody coming to see me. And I'm gonna dive straight into the subject of smoking, I think it is. And I'm gonna use the righting reflex. The next time we see Doreen, we'll slightly adjust the scenario. So she's our flexible friend here and trying to demonstrate Motivational Interviewing. And here in words on the next slide, I'll let you read this, is the story. You've come across it in an earlier slide as well. So if I could perhaps ask you just to read that. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. So she's gonna come in and see me. And I might not mimic absolutely every aspect of every day practice in diabetes care. This is a very artificial scenario in which all I'm trying to illustrate is what happens when you try and persuade someone to change their behavior. I'm not suggesting that this is how you begin your consultations, I bet you don't. But I'm just… This is very artificial. I just want to demonstrate this. But can see, she's at risk on a number of fronts. I'm assuming this is a 10-15 minute consultation. And the question is this "Does using the righting reflex trigger change?" And beneath that is the question "Does the way we speak to people matter?" I'm gonna suggest you this morning that it does. And that using the righting reflex in this situation, not in many others, but in this situation with behavior change, can lead to trouble. Okay. So at this point, I'll perhaps as Doreen to come forward. Her name is really Jeanine, but I'm calling her Doreen. So this is Doreen and she's been briefed, we haven't rehearsed these, these consultations. But she's been briefed and so at this point I'm switching role and she's switching role, and I'm gonna demonstrate the righting reflex. Thank you very much for coming in here today, Doreen. 

00:19:00
DOREEN Okay. 

00:19:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You're looking, you're looking slightly harassed. 

00:19:05
DOREEN Yes. 

00:19:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah? 

00:19:05
DOREEN I'm alright now I'm in here. Yeah. 

00:19:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, you had a bit of a wait in the waiting room, did you? 

00:19:10
DOREEN Yes, yeah. 

00:19:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Did you? 

00:19:10
DOREEN Mm-hm. 

00:19:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. Well, thank you so much for coming and I know I'm not the first person you've seen today. And we've got the, the results of your, of your blood tests. 

00:19:20
DOREEN Right, okay, okay. 

00:19:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Which are fairly high. 

00:19:25
DOREEN Right. 

00:19:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK So we're a little bit concerned about that, okay. 

00:19:25
DOREEN Okay. 

00:19:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And you know, I wanted to take this opportunity to uh, raise the subject of your smoking with you. Because that is the one that… you know, looking at your case notes umm… and thinking about your situation, and thinking about umm… uh, uh, your blood sugar levels, this is the one that strikes us as being the most important. 

00:19:50
DOREEN It's fine. I don't smoke that much. I mean, it's okay, I can deal… I don't need to talk about that now. 

00:20:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You don't want to talk about that now? Okay, but, you know, I, I really do feel it's my professional responsibility to make clear to you that the smoking places you at considerable risk for health problems later on. 

00:20:15
DOREEN I'm, I, I sort of, do know the risks. 

00:20:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right. Right. 

00:20:15
DOREEN I've been told. But I don't think my smoking is, is bad and, and I really, I really would rather not talk about it now. 

00:20:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, well, I just wanted to make sure that you are clear about the health risk and that I had done my professional responsibility to explain those to you. 

00:20:35
DOREEN Yes, but I don't think, my… I don't think is a problem for me. 

00:20:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right now you might not feel it's too much of a problem, but you see what we're looking at in this, in this clinical scenario is, is someone of your age with diabetes, okay? And where we know that diabetes itself places you at greater risk for health problems, which is why we try and help you keep it on control. And that, that the smoking on top of it, it's like a double whammy, you see. 

00:21:00
DOREEN Yeah. 

00:21:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK So it places you at much higher risk. 

00:21:05
DOREEN Umm… but, you know, it's not, it's not a problem, I don't feel. And I really, really would not… Don't want to talk about that. 

00:21:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You don't want to talk about it too much? Would you mind if I just made a couple of other points before you go? Would that… would that be all right? 

00:21:20
DOREEN Okay. 

00:21:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Uh, It's a positive one. It's a positive one about the incredible benefits of cutting down and feeling a lot healthier. And, you know, my, my clinic is littered with people who've succeeded and so I wanted to encourage you to give it some serious thought. 

00:21:40
DOREEN I'm sure they have, but I don't feel unhealthy actually. You know, you might think I'm unhealthy, but I don't feel it. 

00:21:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. 

00:21:45
DOREEN I mean, I know, I know you've said my levels are high, but I… you know, I feel like busy, you know. And I've got lots of things and the smoking is something that, you know, I need at the moment. 

00:22:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right, okay. 

00:22:05
DOREEN And I don't smoke that much, so… 

00:22:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right, and so it's clear that you probably use it to help you relieve stress, is that right? 

00:22:10
DOREEN Yes. 

00:22:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Well, I just want you to know that there's a wide range of quitting aids that we've got access to, here in the clinic, including things that will help with stress. Okay, I think we'll end there. 

00:22:20
DOREEN Okay. 

00:22:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. Perhaps I can ask you to switch role to your real name Jeanine, at this point. 

00:22:25
JEANINE Yes. 

00:22:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Umm… How did you feel in that situation? 

00:22:30
JEANINE Umm… well, because I was wanting to get in quite quickly, I mean, I was waiting for the results and yes, they're high, but I didn't… I mean, the last thing I wanted was a lecture. 

00:22:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right. 

00:22:45
JEANINE Umm… So to immediately go on about smoking, which is always something that you think is, I should maybe one day do, it's not something that I wanted to talk about and so… 

00:22:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. So you didn't feel very comfortable. 

00:23:00
JEANINE I didn't feel very comfortable and I did feel that even though I said, I'd rather not talk about it now, you did keep talking about. 

00:23:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK I was a bit of bully, yeah. I didn't quite expect you to say, you didn't want to talk about it. And I was a bit of a bully. I note just that I spent quite a lot of time on that two, three, maybe four minutes and I would consider that wasted time. So when we talk about how long it takes to do motivation interviewing, we've got to also think about how much time we spend on the alternative. Remember, I'm not suggesting that this is how you practice. I'm simply trying to illustrate, in rather extreme form, umm… the righting reflex. But there's one question I want to ask Jeanine, which is a little bit wicked, right? 

00:23:45
JEANINE Okay. 

00:23:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Can I ask you, did you lie to me, in role, when you said you didn't smoke very much, were you lying? 

00:23:50
JEANINE Yeah, yeah. 

00:23:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You were minimizing. 

00:23:55
JEANINE Yes. 

00:23:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, you were denying it slightly to try and yeah… 

00:24:00
JEANINE Yeah. 

00:24:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK So this is, this is exactly the situation that Miller and I encountered in the early '80s when we developed Motivational Interviewing, which was that textbooks were full of stuff about these addicts who pathologically lied, typically that's said about alcoholics. And his, I think, brilliant observation was that the more you confront someone, which is what I've just illustrated, the more they deny and lie. And when he shifted his style, the lying and denying lessened. So when you meet a patient who's in denial, it, it, it is actually a signal not to pass a judgment about their pathology, but to consider how you can better communicate with them, make them feel comfortable enough so that they don't lie. Like my 17-year-old lies to me and not his best buddy, do you see the point I'm making? It's got something to do with him and me. All right, thank you so much Jeanine. 

00:25:00
JEANINE Thank you. 

00:25:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And we'll catch you in a little while when we demonstrate hopefully some things a bit more positive. Thank you very much. Okay. So in this next slide, it captures it quite nicely. Excuse me. When the righting reflex meets ambivalence, and I would say, she probably was a bit ambivalent about her smoking, we never got a hint of it, but I handled her so badly that we never got that chance. When these two meet, things don't go so well. I've got a slide here on communication styles. And I could ask you to guess which of these three styles I was using in that interview. These are all naturally used styles when we try and help people. And I think you'll agree I was using quite a firm instructional directing style. And each one of these has its place in every day life. It's not a question of one being better than another. It's more a question of which style is best suited to which circumstance. So this is a little model I constructed some years ago with a group of nurses. And the conclusion that we came to was that when you're trying to encourage behavior change in someone else, it's the style of a guide that's probably most suitable. That, that takes us back to my little boy, it's, it's coming alongside someone and trying to help them find their own path to change, that captures them is the guiding style. Now I'm slowing down and being a little bit ponderous at this point, in order to make a really critical comment, which is that Motivational Interviewing is just a refined form of this naturally used style, guiding. We all know how to do it, watch a mother with her child, watch a quality teaching, a pastor, a quality healthcare practitioner, we have this in us. All I'm gonna be talking about today is a way of sharpening your conversational skills to do this better. And in that sense, most of Motivational Interviewing, 80 percent of it is basically guiding and therefore not new. The top 20 percent is what I'll highlight as we go along. So I hope you find that diagram useful. Now in the next few slides, this is more for you to read and look at. I've got two smoking cessation consultations, one of them involves using the righting reflex and one of them is MI consistent. I shan't be going through them with you, but they're there for your reference. I'll highlight only one thing which is in the second of these, the MI consistent one, notice it takes the same amount of time. So for those of you wondering where the MI can be done briefly, I think here is the answer. With sufficient skill and thoughtfulness, I think the answer is yes. Okay. And you'll find some very good examples of listening in that I script, I made it up. But I thought you might mind that useful as something to study. So in conclusion to this whole question about how you help people change, you don't have to make change happen in someone else, like I was trying to do with Doreen, because you can't. Only Doreen can change her behavior. I can't make people change. And as we saw there with her, you don't have to come up with all the answers and have this as a weight upon your shoulders, because you probably don't have the best ones for her, she has them. And I'm hoping that will inspire you to want to learn more about Motivational Interviewing, which is the polar opposite of what you saw me doing. It takes the weight off your shoulders. The idea being that the answer to this stuff comes from her, not from me. And I guess a lovely way of describing this is that you're not wrestling, which is what you saw Doreen and I doing, it's more like a form of dancing, a tango, I'm learning to do the Lindy hop at the moment, believe it or not, even at my age. And is a wonderful… That's a wonderful metaphor, Lindy Hop is a wonderful metaphor for Motivational Interviewing. But I won't discuss my dancing anymore, I think I'll move on. So this question of how do people change, I guess, it's quite straight forward what I'm saying. We have inside us our own good reasons to change and much of the strength to make it happen. It's how you draw this motivation and strength out of the patients with diabetes that can lift their motivation and improve your behavioral and medication adherence outcomes. So I believe that's all I want to say about way of introduction because what we're going to turn to now, for the final hour, is Motivational Interviewing. And I'm gonna grab one more sip of my coffee, before we do that, and then we're on the road. I hope you're enjoying the seminar, my accent is from South Africa, some of might be wondering, and my age remains undisclosed. Okay, so first thing I want to try and get across is what we call the spirits of Motivational Interviewing. If you like, this is like trying to describe the tango or Lindy hop dance, I'm sure you'll appreciate that if you… That a dance form is not just a set of steps, there's something bigger that, that, that is captured by the word style in a dance. And it's exactly the same with Motivational Interviewing. I will go into the technical steps in a short while, but probably, as any dance teacher will tell you, it's that flow, it's the nature, the way you relate to the other person or what we've called the spirit, that is the most important. So let me make a few points about the spirit now. There are lots of different ways of describing this, but I think these words in these four circles cover quite a lot, okay. Compassion and feeling it is what I felt from the nurse that I called. I felt that… I realized that she felt compassion for me and that was a critical element of her effective intervention. She listened to me and I had a sense that the two of us were collaborating together. And I guess also acceptance was something that I felt. In other words, even though I was apparently being a naughty boy wanting to go against medical and nursing opinion by stopping taking my tablets, she accepted me as a human being. She might not have agreed with me, but she accepted me as a human being capable of strength of making choices and so she went along with what I wanted. Now that… you'll notice those three elements that I've described, we could have used other words. And I often think, well, really, that's just being helpful. I've, I've, I've spent a minute using fancy language to describe someone who is helpful. And I think that's right and that explains why, why I said, Motivational Interviewing is 70-80 percent helpful guiding. Because we see these qualities in helpfulness in all forms, not just Motivational Interviewing. But then there's that fourth circle down below which I think is the 20-30 percent that Miller discovered and that the two of us have developed, which we've called evocation. Now, boy, we tried to find other words for this. Umm… It's not easy. And what, what does evocation mean? I think it means helping someone to develop a new perspective. So if, if, if I evoke, if I manage to demonstrate this letter later, what I hope to do with Doreen is to evoke from her, her own good reasons to do something about her smoking. So evoking is something that I very actively do to help her form a different way of looking at things. That's quite tough to put in words what I've just described, umm… but I'll probably come back to that a number of times in the course of this seminar. Here in the next slide, we have a definition of Motivational Interviewing, person-centered, goal orientated, counseling style. So it's not just like non-directive counseling in which you spend a lot of time sitting passively listening to someone, maybe going around in circles, it's very purposeful and goal orientated, in a form that I'll turn to, very soon. And it's focused on the common problem of ambivalence about change. So if change in the patient is not on the horizon in your consultation, Motivational Interviewing is not relevant, which is why most of your diabetes care, you will be using a directing style to solve this or that problem, which is absolutely what you do and I would encourage you to do. But when change is on the horizon and you shift that, shift to that, I would suggest a shift from that directing style to a guiding style. So there's the definition for you. Now I'm going to spend 5-7 minutes on the dance steps themselves. I've described the spirit. These are the dance steps which you can practice every single day with your patients, with your friends, with your colleagues, that's what my dance teacher says, the more practice, the better you get, do the steps over and over again. I was told to stand on the bus stop and go one-two, one-two-three, one-two-three, one-two, one-two-three, one-two-three. And I thought it was a bit absurd, but actually it's been hugely valuable. And my wife and I do that now when we're making food. And it kind of get ingrained in you in such a way that you can umm… do it almost without thinking, whereas to begin with, sometimes the dance steps feel very forced and, and that will an experience that you have, should you try to use some of these skills. Let me go through them. Open questions, do you know the difference between an open and a closed question? Sorry, that was a rather feeble joke because what I just said there was a closed question. In other words, it has a yes/no answer. And I think as, as you mostly, most of you know, open question is something that opens things up for the patient to describe whatever it is you've asked them about. Affirmation is hugely powerful. If you look at the, the NPR, just I think it was last week, the NPR, National Public Radio Ted Hour, monthly Ted Hour on education, there's a speaker there that I heard just last night, it's about the finest example of describing what affirmation means, in her case, a teacher with children. Honestly it's… Her name was Rita someone, I've forgotten, but that is the most magnificent series of Ted Talks. Affirmation is something that good teachers use, parents use it all the time, and what is it? Well, it's not just the same thing as praise. Praise is a judgment that you pass about somebody and it can be useful, like a compliment, it's something that I say about you. Affirmation means pointing to someone's strengths and good qualities without passing judgment. So if I said to Jeanine, to Doreen, sorry, "You're a really busy person umm… and it wasn't easy for you to get here today, but you've arrived." Can you see, now that's an affirmation. I'm not… It's not praise, well done for coming here, that's something quite… that's a judgment. And I think affirmation sits at the heart of human growth in relationships. If you got the right goggles on and you're looking at someone's strengths, you will naturally use affirmation. If you've got the wrong goggles on, you're gonna struggle. Thirdly, reflection, you can't… Motivational Interviewing as a dance form doesn't exist without reflection. It's one of the critical, critical dance steps. Now if you've got questions, and summaries, which is the one to follow, what goes on in between? There's a very common pattern… I've looked at transcripts of diabetes consultations, run training courses, and what I find is that people can get sunk into a little bit of a question-answer trap, in which the main skill they demonstrate very well sometimes is question, provide the answer, question, provide the answer, question, provide the answer. That places you in more of an expert role than may be with behavior change you need to be. And somehow, you need to try and balance out the relationship so that you're alongside someone. And it's hard to do that if the only skill you're using is, is questioning and then occasional summary. Reflection is the piece in the middle that is incredibly valuable. And I'm hoping that you'll see, you will see lots of examples of me using this in moment. But I wanted to intellectually describe what it is. Umm… I'm, I'm laughing a little bit because it's like such a big subject for me and now in the space of 90 seconds, I'm gonna just describe what it is that says quite a subject. A reflection is a statement that you make to the patient which captures how they are feeling, experiencing, what they want, whatever. If you like, it's a short summary of what they've either said or haven't said. It's at the heart of listening. So listening is not a passive process of me sitting back and letting Doreen talk. In this view, listening is a very active process in which I make these little short summaries that give Doreen a sense that I'm with her, and that she's invited and encouraged to carry on talking. The qualities I need are acceptance, I need the right goggles on, and I need to be really curious, and I need to slow down and give, both Doreen and myself, space to reflect so that I've got time to see if I can capture what she's saying or feeling and her time to move on. Now that, that phrase "move on" is interesting because in some forms of counseling, listening and reflection, same thing, are used just to explore things. And in Motivational Interviewing, this is, this is the, the, the 20-30 percent that's unique about Motivational Interviewing. The listening is used purposefully to evoke talk about change. It's not just used broadly to summarize whatever someone's saying. And I really hope I'll be able to demonstrate that to you. Listening is used purposefully and when you see me make reflections, I'm hoping roughly in the proportion of 3 or 4 reflections to every question, I might not achieve it, but we would say in the Motivational Interviewing dance school, if you like, that if you can, if you can use three or four of these reflections to every question, your level of competence in the dance is high. And I hope I can, I can illustrate that for you. Fourthly, there's summarizing and if I've described reflective listening as a short summary in which you actually establish an empathic connection with her because that's the effect. The longer summary is just the most marvelous opportunity for doubling that. In other words, if you're clocking and logging what someone's saying as they're going along, that summary allows you to do uh, uh, what Bill Miller describes, I think very beautifully, is like hand them a bouquet of flowers, which is a gathering of everything that they've said. I, I referred to the flowers there because you don't want to hand them a bunch of weeds. So in Motivational Interviewing, you'd hand them a bunch of flowers which are the good reasons that they have given for why want a change. So if you like, that summary is a collection of things that the person has said that you've picked up that you provide for them. If you're ever feeling a bit lost in a consultation, summaries is a brilliant way of upbringing it all together and I frequently do this in my clinical work. I wonder if you'd mind if I'd just stop you there, just want to see if I've understood what you've said and they don't mind that, they love that, and I summarize and if there's something missing, they'd tell you. But you probably notice that it's got an additional advantage, which is now, if they said, "Yes, you've got me." Now I change direction. So in a way, summary is like a, a thing where you're grabbing the anchor of the boat and going, "Whoa! Okay, now we're moving in that direction." So summary serve multiple purposes, including giving you control over changes in direction. Offering information and advice is central in Motivational Interviewing, there's nothing that I'm trying to say here today that implies that you shouldn't use your expertise, it's how it's done that is critical. And this is not a subject that's being studied sufficiently, but I'd like to in 15-20 seconds capture the difference between giving information that's Motivational Interviewing consistent or not. Inconsistent would be to simply dump information on her and you saw me do that actually quite skillfully, do you know about the health risks, blah-blah-blah-blah. Skillful information giving, that's MI consistence, involves asking permission, asking her what she knows or want to know before you give her the information. In other words, you're evoking before you give the information. Giving her the information and then asking her what sense she makes of the information. And we've got a little uh, uh, framework, which we call elicit provide elicit to describe that. And so you'll notice there that two-thirds of the process of information giving is eliciting or evoking. So that's it, I promised I wouldn't take more than 20 seconds, I probably did, but big subject. Information giving and expertise are at the heart of Motivational Interviewing, it's how you do it. Okay, I think I'm gonna grab a sip of water. 

00:47:30
[sil.] 

00:47:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And move on now to try and describe to you in what sense Motivational Interviewing is purposeful, what do we mean by evoking? I think that's the last little piece of the puzzle I need to put together, clarify what evoking means before demonstrating it. So the goal of Motivational Interviewing is to quietly clarify someone's uncertainty and elicit what we call change talk. Change talk is all the reasons why they think it's worthwhile to change or why they might be able to change, the why and how of change, but coming out of her mouth, not mine, that's change talk. The opposite of change talk is what we call sustain talk. And what you saw in the interview between me and Doreen was I was giving voice to the case for change, I was giving voice to change talk and she was emitting change talk, sustain talk, and that was the function of the way I set up the interview. Ideally, I want to try and elicit that change talk for Doreen. Now that is something that, that requires vigilance and, and practice on your part. And I'm hoping that at the end of this seminar, you'll pay attention and want… and be curious about when you hear change talk in your patients, because when you do, whoa, slow down, stay with it. But step one is to be able to recognize it. Then the next step is to reinforce it and you'll see me doing, I'll show you what I mean now. So here's an example on the next slide. So somebody like Doreen might say, "I don't why I'm like this, but it's his fault too because he also smokes, and now I'm back to 20 a day. I want to quit but how can I when he behaves like that." Now that is a very typical thing that a patient might say to you. Can you see it's quite a mouthful of busy talk? And the question is where in there is the change talk? And someone who's using Motivational Interviewing will be listening out for strengths and listening out for change talk. Someone says that, you could start talking about the husband. You could start talking about how hopeless she feels. But with Motivational Interviewing, you would pick up the change talk and it's "I want to quit." That's a very powerful thing for someone to say despite the hopelessness that she feels. And that's what you've got your, your curious ear out for in Motivational Interviewing. So when you hear it, that's one of the flowers that Miller refers to. And you'll present it back to her in a summary, but in the moment to moment into action before the summary, you'd want to ideally use reflection. You could say, in response to this, if she says, "I want to quit." You could just say, "Why? Why do you want to quit?" What she will then… the answer will be more change talk. And a very interesting line of research in Motivational Interviewing is now coming up with this observation that the more change talk you get from someone with diabetes, the more likely they will be to change. And the more you use these sort of open questions and reflections, the more likely you, you will be to get the change talk. The more confrontational you are, the more sustain talk, the poorer the outcome. That seems to be the kind of model that's emerging. Okay, but the critical point is this that we believe that the change talk predicts better outcome, and that is evoking. Evoking will be the consequence of eliciting more change talk. And here I've returned on the next slide to that MI consistent consultation about smoking. And I've highlighted both, the change talk there, and the use of reflection in response to it in a very, very brief consultation. So I guess this idea about evoking itself is not new, I think it's the technical doing it that, that we've contributed to. Here's, he is a wonderful polymath called Blaise Pascal from the 17th century. People are generally better persuaded by the reasons they have themselves discovered, than those that come into the mind of others. That's exactly what we mean by evoking. Okay, I'm gonna slip, skip that slide. And I'm gonna show you a slide that captures the four process model for Motivational Interviewing that's emerged in our most recent edition of our text book. And then briefly, try and illustrate each of them. It's gonna be a challenge. But this is what we're saying would happen in an effective behavior change consultation, not an entire diabetes consultation. But when you get on to the subject of behavior change, this is what we suggest it might look like. First of all, you'll want to engage with the person. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Then you'll want to find some kind of useful direction, which is particularly important in diabetes, where as we know, so often you could talk about diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, medication adherence, you'll see me try and do that with Doreen. It's usually best not done by me deciding what to talk about, but reaching that decision together. So engage, these are like steps that you go up. Engage, focus, establish a direction. And it's only then, once you've got a focus that Motivational Interviewing is, is… can be carried out, in which case you would try and draw out their own good reasons to change, which is evoking. And if they're ready to plan changes with them. And we're suggesting in this new framework and, and textbook that all the principles of the dance that I've described thus far are directly relevant when you're planning change with someone, to a broadened Motivation Interviewing, to include change planning. And we're suggesting that that's a very delicate conversation that's vulnerable to all the processes you saw me, traps you saw me falling into with Doreen in the planning stage. So that's the new model very briefly. And I'm going to move on to say few words about engage now. And then I'm gonna try and demonstrate it. And I've asked Doreen to flex a little bit. I've asked Jeanine to flex a little bit and ramp up the pressure on me a little bit in this next interview. But I want to say a word or two about engage, which is what I'm gonna demonstrate now, okay. Settling into a helpful conversation. I've got three tips here. One is, don't do anything else to begin with. Indeed, I would begin every consultation that way and do, okay, nothing else but engage, which is a wonderful opportunity to listen. I want to encourage you to practice listening, because the more skilled you are at doing just listening, the more time you'll save. And I hope I can demonstrate that to you. And I, I would also encourage you to address the issue of, of, of, if you like, culture change in the organization around you, where everybody's encouraged to engage with patients first before solving problems. Because that's why I didn't want to return to that doctor, okay. Because the nurse engaged with me first and, and, and helped me improve my outcomes. I've got a wicked thing down there in red at the bottom of the slide called the 20 percent rule. And I'm finding in my clinical practice as a psychologist, I'm doing it and it works a treat. For me, the first 20 percent, at least of a consultation, I'm just engaging. Now if you've got a 10 minute consultation, that's 2-3 minutes. That's what you're gonna see me demonstrate now. I don't mean that you stop engaging afterwards. But the wonderful platform you can establish with somebody if you engage first umm… reaps rewards and saves you time in the long run and improves outcomes, okay. Now let's have a look at a demonstration of engagement. Here's the case of Doreen on the slide. I believe you know the scenario. One addition that I've asked Jeanine to do here, which is that I've asked her to be pretty angry, okay, when she comes in because I want to try and illustrate that listening can be very helpful for, for engaging and also for diffusing difficulty and anger. So what you'll see me do here, let's hope, is a four or five or six to one proportion of reflections to every question that I ask. But in every other sense, I'm assuming this is a normal consultation, she comes in for a diabetes check up, and she's angry. Okay, so she's gonna ramp it up, I don't know exactly what she's gonna come out with. But I'm comfortable with my role as engage beyond all else to begin with. So let's, let’s ask Jeanine to come in, Doreen to come in again. Well, thank, thank, thank you very much, Doreen, for coming in again… 

00:57:45
DOREEN Do you know what? I've been waiting outside for 40 minutes. 

00:57:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Really? 

00:57:45
DOREEN And people have come and gone, come and gone. You know, it's like a conveyor belt and I'm sat here. And people who came in way after me have been in before me. And I'm just late now for work. And I just don't believe how long it takes to come here to get in to see you. 

00:58:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, I'm ever so sorry to hear this, but what, what actually happened? You, you, you came on time… 

00:58:10
DOREEN I came… I came early, but I'm not counting that five minutes I was here early. I've been waiting 40 minutes since my appointment was supposed to be. 

00:58:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. And you felt that there were other people who came after you… 

00:58:20
DOREEN Yes. 

00:58:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And for some reason, were lucky enough to go in, in front of you. 

00:58:25
DOREEN I mean, I don't know, they all came into see you. I'm not saying that. 

00:58:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK No. 

00:58:25
DOREEN But they all, it's like a conveyor belt, it's in and out, in and out, in and out. Every time the names were called, where was my name? No. 

00:58:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And that just didn't feel fair to you? 

00:58:35
DOREEN Not at all, no. I've got a meeting to go to. And work, you know, I have to get to that meeting on time. I'm hoping that everyone is, you know, on time. And people should be on time. 

00:58:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And I guess it also makes you feel that it's not you as a person that matters here. It's just you being treated like… 

00:58:50
DOREEN It's a conveyor belt. It's like in and out. You know, we're just numbers on a conveyor belt. It's like a random conveyor belt. I just don't know when I was gonna get here. 

00:59:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And leaving you wondering that you may be coming here and not get treated like an individual human being. 

00:59:05
DOREEN Exactly, yes, yes. 

00:59:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And that's extremely frustrating. 

00:59:10
DOREEN Very frustrating. 

00:59:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And you weren't sure how you were… how it was gonna be when you walked in here? 

00:59:15
DOREEN No. 

00:59:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK But the one thing you did know for sure was that you felt really angry and frustrated. 

00:59:20
DOREEN Yes, yes. 

00:59:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, okay, okay, okay. And what's happening to before you came in, in the life around this appointment for you, is that life isn't a picnic. 

00:59:35
DOREEN No. I mean, I've got like a tight time scale, you know, deadline for work. I had this meeting that was called yesterday. But I knew I would make it because I knew my appointment time here. And I could have easily made it and I know I'm ten minutes late for my meeting. And I haven't been to see you yet and I haven't got my results or anything. 

00:59:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And we haven't… Yeah, and we haven't even finished yet and now you're gonna be back late for this meeting and wondering what you're gonna get out of the consultation. 

00:59:55
DOREEN Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:00:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Can I see if I can just briefly summarize what you're saying and then we'll move on? I'll try and be as helpful as I can. 

01:00:05
DOREEN Sure. 

01:00:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, you've come her for your routine diabetes check. 

01:00:10
DOREEN Yup. 

01:00:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Not easy. And you've fixed things up at work so that you could get back at the right time. Got here and felt humiliated by having to wait like that… 

01:00:20
DOREEN Exactly, yes. 

01:00:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK In the waiting room and you've come in here now feeling really angry and hoping that the appointment doesn't take too long. 

01:00:30
DOREEN Yeah, I hope, yeah. That about sums it up, yeah. 

01:00:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Did I got you? Anything else you want to add? 

01:00:40
DOREEN No, that's just about it, really. I just can't believe how long it took. 

01:00:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. Well, let's cut there. Let's ask you to come out of role and help us understand what the experience was like for you? 

01:00:55
JEANINE Umm… well, I guess I came in all guns blazing, I didn't know what to expect, but I think I expected a bit of a to and fro… 

01:01:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, you were pretty, you were pretty angry when you came in. I was a bit shocked. I didn't expect you to be that angry. 

01:01:10
JEANINE Okay. 

01:01:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, I just about, kind of… 

01:01:10
JEANINE The circumstances were that I've been there five minutes before time, I've had to wait 40 minutes, people were in and out, in and out. I had a meeting to go to and it's just everything builds up when you're outside. 

01:01:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah and you were getting quite stressed, and you walked in here actually furious, right? 

01:01:25
JEANINE Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:01:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. 

01:01:30
JEANINE Because that's pulled my timings out. 

01:01:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And how did you feel at the end? 

01:01:35
JEANINE End. Well, I certainly was able to say my piece. You know, I was able to vent my… I didn't know what else to expect. It's just I expected to be voltage, you know, have a little bit of a fight. 

01:01:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:01:50
JEANINE And I don't know what the outcome would have been, but I felt that I was able to say what I wanted to say. You seemed to understand what I was saying because, well, you were saying it back to me for a start. 

01:02:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:02:05
JEANINE So I… And it sort of… Actually you were saying what I had said to you, it was making me think and then agree with you that you understood and we were on the same… 

01:02:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. I think I was about five of six, couple of questions to begin with and then rest was reflective listening. Some of them were just restating what she said, some of them were actually putting new words in like, you felt humiliated, to the extent that that was accurate, it was guess, right. She could have put me right if was wrong, I don't think it was. It's the extent to which we save time. Because when I said, you felt humiliated, she gave me a look like, you got me exactly how I feel. And that's the sense in which listening saves time. I'm not sure how long that took, I suspect it's two minutes, two to three minutes. So I'm happy that I've, I've given you quite a reasonable demonstration of engagement using core skills, primarily listening, interesting whether I used affirmation, you probably find I did in the summary. You know, it was quite hard for you to come up here today. I could have probably used a lot more affirmation than I did. Umm… but there you go, that was rough and ready and I'm hoping it's given you a good sense of what engagement means, a phrase I use is rapid engagement. I think we're ready to move on in this consultation to what we'll be focusing. And perhaps I'll ask you just to stay where you are now. The camera can focus on wherever it likes. But I want to move on to the next process, which is focusing. So I've said, "Anything else?" And she says, "No, you've got me." Okay, I'm 2-3 minutes into this, into this consultation. What are we gonna talk about? Now, I'm biasing this whole process in favor of behavior change because I want to illustrate MI. I'm fully aware that there are whole range of other things you might want to do, I'm using dramatic license here. So I'm not assuming that what I do is the way you do or should behave in a consultation. I'm aware of all the other things you've got to do. But if I was wanting to use Motivational Interviewing, this is what I would be considering way next. Okay, and that's what we mean by focusing. I want to just say a couple of words about that. 

01:04:40
[sil.] 

01:04:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Any skilled guide or coach would take focusing very seriously. You're going to a travel agent, the first question they want to ask you is "Where you want to go?" And should we, should we be treating patients any differently? Well, I think, with a, with a disease that requires so much self management, we do well to invest energy in clarifying what we're gonna talk about, what direction we're going into the consultation, and therefore she, afterwards. And that's what I want to try and demonstrate now. And beneath this sits something which is not on a PowerPoint slide, but which we've written about quite extensively, which we call it gender mapping. Okay, it's a bit like, you know, you're sitting in a little, little boat and you're about to go for a… about to go for a little sail together, she's learning to sail. And the first thing we do is take a map out and consider which way we're going to go. Now I'll have some firm views about that because I know where the rocks are, right. But she'll have her aspirations too. And it's in the convergence of those two agendas that skillful focusing lies. Okay, I am need to say to you that I have discussed this with Jeanine beforehand, okay. And that we will probably move in the direction of smoking and yet I will still want to illustrate a much broader starting point. So I'll start that now, from, from the end, where we left off a moment ago. Doreen, I appreciate you're busy. 

01:06:40
DOREEN Okay. 

01:06:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And my plan is to spend another 5-10 minutes with you this morning and then say goodbye. And I'm hoping that you'll leave feeling that I've, I've listened to you, and that you've got something useful out of it. 

01:06:55
DOREEN I hope so too. 

01:06:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, okay. And we could talk about a number of things today. And especially given your, your time shortage, I suggest we be quite selective in this check up. 

01:07:05
DOREEN Right. 

01:07:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK We could talk about your, umm… your blood results, which are a little bit on the high side. 

01:07:15
DOREEN Okay. 

01:07:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You might or might not be interested to know about that. We could talk about your diet. Better diet improves well-being in diabetes. We could talk about your alcohol consumption, okay. We could talk about your smoking or we could talk about your medication use. Now I'm interested to know, I must be really honest with you, I feel that smoking is something we should at least gently touch on today. But I'm happy to be told no if there's something that you'd rather talk about instead. 

01:08:00
DOREEN Umm… 

01:08:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK I'm trying to form some kind of agreement here. 

01:08:05
DOREEN It's just… It's something I don't really like being brought up. I mean, well, I could, well, we'll talk about. If we're going to talk about one thing, yeah, well, let's talk about smoking. 

01:08:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You're sure? 

01:08:25
DOREEN Well. 

01:08:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK As long as I don't give you a lecture about it, you might be… 

01:08:30
DOREEN As long as I don't get a lecture, definitely, yes. I don't need a lecture. I've had enough lectures over the years. 

01:08:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, okay. Stopping there because that's just an example of focusing, it was an example of a gender mapping. I touched on a number of areas. The one I wanted to touch on, she seemed okay about, but often it's not like that. You may need to spend a bit more time on it. So that's focusing. Can you see the sense in which I've asked permission, raised the subject of behavior change, smoking. She's sighing. She's looking forward to getting out. I've got 5-7 minutes, how can I make that useful now? She's not crossed with me, she's not furious anymore. She's happy to talk about it. I think it's quite good progress. So that's where we move on to evoking and planning. And I want to say a word or two about those two first. And then have a conversation with Doreen in which I hope they're illustrated. So if you could stay where you are. 

01:09:30
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:09:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:09:30
DOREEN Okay. 

01:09:35
[sil.] 

01:09:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Evoking is drawing out our own good reasons to change. And I want to say a word or two about that. 

01:09:55
[sil.] 

01:10:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK I want to try and see if I can set up the conversation, so that I elicit change talk. I've got a starting assumption here, which is the, where Motivational Interviewing came from, which is that very often when people are faced with difficult behavior change, they're not either motivated or not motivated, they feel ambivalent. In their minds, they've got different voices. Some of those voices are in favor of change. Some of them are in favor of staying the same. And in that indecisive state, people often just stick with a status quo which is staying the same, okay. Can you, can you help tip the balance and how do you do that? First of all, I don't want you to get the impression that there's this rather singular manipulative focus on change talk and, and a neglect of sustain talk. What we call sustain talk is a normal part of their experience. And I think it's quite important to hear it. It's just that in Motivational Interviewing, you wouldn't reinforce the sustain talk. And you try and gently point the conversation in the direction of change or change talk. Asking simple questions that evoke change talk is what you can do with all you patients, any time. And then you need to listen and to notice it. And that's where you'll see me use reflective listening, hopefully, the most effectively. When I use those reflections, they will be purposeful and pretty intentional. And then at the end, I will, I will try and summarise the bouquet of flowers for her. And I'm not sure, whether we'll get then, I told you beforehand, we might or might not get here, I don't…we're not going to decide that now, we're gonna improvise with you. We might move on to planning. I don't know how ready she is to change, but she might be ready to talk about actually quitting, okay. But I'm gonna start with evoking. But if we do get to planning, I can see some serious traps we could fall in to. And I've seen plenty practitioners in the diabetes field do this, which is someone seems reasonable ready to change, so you tell them what to do, you pull out the righting reflex. And I think the main challenge for me will be to hold back from solving the problem for her. You can see it coming, can't you? Look, we've got these nicotine patches, would you like a nicotine patch? Can you see that it's driven by compassion, but it's not going to help her? We want to try and work together on a concrete plan in which I might throw in some ideas, but when I throw my ideas in, I will offer, how about this, I'll offer suggestions rather than advice. Can, and can you see the difference? If I suggest something, that leaves it up to her to decide whether she wants to take it up or not, I'm reinforcing autonomy and choice for her rather than offer her advice, which is, I think, instead of doing this, you should do that. So I love the word suggestion, I think you'll, hopefully, you'll see me trying to demonstrate it. But ether way, the idea is we work together .And that takes us right back to the beginning of the seminar where I talked about that little boy. And as she crosses the line into actually thinking about changing and quitting, I want to be alongside her, not either in front of her or behind her. Now how I strike that balance, we'll just have to see, okay. But what I'm gonna do now is demonstrate evoking and planning, if we get there. I'm taking a look at the time. And I notice we're doing pretty well. We've got 10-15 minutes left. So when we finish this demonstration and any debriefing, I've got a little list of extra hot topics that we could touch on, that I thought I would turn to by way of conclusion. But this is the last demonstration. I'm nervous as hell because here I am in front of all the, in front of cameras and things, and I don't know which way it's gonna go. Umm… I'm gonna pick up exactly where we left off last time, which was in your role now, Doreen, we were… Ah, that's right. I was asking whether she'd mind if we talked about smoking. And so that's where we'll pick it up and let's see how I get on. Can I ask you to… Am I being compassionate, demonstrating acceptance, collaborations? Those are the spirit, evocations? How am I getting on with the dance steps, open questions, reflection, affirmation, and summary? Let's see if you can see all of those. I'll be surprised if I get it all, but I'm gonna have a go. So you don't, you don't mind about having a brief chat about your smoking? 

01:15:35
DOREEN I don't mind talking about it, no. 

01:15:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You, you do hope, but you don't want to be lectured to. 

01:15:40
DOREEN No, don't want a lecture. 

01:15:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Or ordered around. 

01:15:40
DOREEN No, I've had a lot of those. 

01:15:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, I, I, I promise I won't do that. 

01:15:45
DOREEN Right. Good. 

01:15:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. 

01:15:45
DOREEN Good. 

01:15:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And… It's how you really feel about it, that's probably a very good starting point. 

01:15:55
DOREEN How I feel about my smoke? 

01:15:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, how do you really feel about it? 

01:16:00
DOREEN Umm… well, I've smoked for, I suppose, for quite a long time. I enjoy it. It helps me when I'm stressed. 

01:16:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:16:10
DOREEN And… that's the main thing. 

01:16:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. 

01:16:15
DOREEN Enjoyment, helps me when I'm stressed. 

01:16:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, because you've got quite a busy life, you've got quite a busy home life and work life. 

01:16:20
DOREEN Yes. Yeah. 

01:16:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You're balancing quite a long of things. 

01:16:25
DOREEN Of course, yeah. 

01:16:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And you're in the fast lane quite a lot. 

01:16:30
DOREEN And this slows me down. This is like, I'm in the slow lane and having a cigarette. 

01:16:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK All right. I thought you, I thought you were gonna say coming to see me is like in a slow lane. No, no, yeah, the smoke…Yeah, that's right. So you're moving around quite often in the fast lane, quite competently, you're a good driver. 

01:16:45
DOREEN Well, there's lots… I mean we've all got busy lives. I mean, I know, I mean I can't… But I can only talk for myself. 

01:16:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:16:50
DOREEN Yes, yeah, busy, busy. 

01:16:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And… 

01:16:50
DOREEN And fitting a lots of things in. 

01:16:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And, and it's nice to have some time to kind of unwind and just take a little bit of a breather, and the smoking helps you do that. Do you notice that's sustain talk and I'm reinforcing it by reflecting it. I said earlier, there's no problem with that as long as you don't get stuck there. Okay, so the smoking helps you unwind and it helps you relax. 

01:17:15
DOREEN It does, yeah. 

01:17:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Something you've done for quite a while. 

01:17:15
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:17:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:17:15
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:17:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And sorry, I got a bit stuck there. Something you've done for quite a while and probably with the people around you, with your friends, you're not the only one. 

01:17:30
DOREEN I'm not the only one, no. I mean, not all of my friends smoke, no, but my husband smokes. 

01:17:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right. 

01:17:40
DOREEN And… 

01:17:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK So it's there at home for you? 

01:17:40
DOREEN We don't smoke in the house. 

01:17:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right, okay. 

01:17:40
DOREEN We do smoke outside. 

01:17:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. 

01:17:45
DOREEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:17:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, but it's part of your every day home life and social life. 

01:17:50
DOREEN It is, yeah. 

01:17:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And can I ask you what about, if you've noticed anything about your smoking that you're concerned about? 

01:17:55
DOREEN Well, it's expensive. 

01:18:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. Okay. 

01:18:00
DOREEN I mean, I know, I know it's not good for you because everybody tells you, you know, from the word go, I've heard it all my life, you know. 

01:18:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, so you've… There is money that's something that, that, that you've noticed, but coming to clinic with your diabetes. 

01:18:20
DOREEN Yes, yeah. 

01:18:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK This isn't the first time that the subject of smoking has been raised. 

01:18:25
DOREEN It's not the first time the subject of smoking, but it's… It's difficult to say that we all have our voices or whatever, but my friends, like few of my friends, yeah, when we smoke, you know… 

01:18:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right. 

01:18:40
DOREEN It's sort of… 

01:18:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK It's like part of your normal life and you're trying to get on with your normal life despite your diabetes. 

01:18:45
DOREEN I'm trying… Yes, exactly. 

01:18:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Is that how it is? 

01:18:50
DOREEN I'm trying to live my life normally like everybody else. 

01:18:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, and so they're different balances for you to strike? 

01:19:00
DOREEN It is a difficult balance because I know, I mean, I've got diabetes and my friends, neither of my friends or my husband have. 

01:19:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And how do you see the link between your smoking and your diabetes? 

01:19:15
DOREEN Well, I know, I know it would be better if I didn't smoke, I know that. 

01:19:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Why is that? 

01:19:25
DOREEN Well, it's bad for you, bad for you anyway, for anyone who hasn't got an illness… 

01:19:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right. 

01:19:30
DOREEN Or a disease. 

01:19:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right. 

01:19:35
DOREEN But you sort of try and put that in the back of your mind because… And just go around thinking I'm fine. 

01:19:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, and try and get on with life, but when you stop and just think about it, it sounds like you're a little bit concerned about your smoking and diabetes. You've had people nag you in the past… 

01:19:55
DOREEN I've had people nag me. 

01:19:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK But deep down, what it feels like for you is that your smoking isn't ideal. 

01:20:05
DOREEN Well, it's not ideal, no. 

01:20:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Or am I putting words in your mouth? 

01:20:10
DOREEN Well, no. You are, but it isn't ideal. I mean, it's not like that. It's something that I find, as I said, relaxing. 

01:20:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK It's relaxing, that's right. Yeah, yeah. So it's something that you do enjoy and that's important for you. And on the other hand you can also see that, that it's not ideal for you. 

01:20:30
DOREEN Yeah, yeah. 

01:20:35
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. And where does that leave you? You can see the ambivalence is quite clear here. 

01:20:45
DOREEN Umm… I always say, I always say to my husband, let's, well, he says it to me, then I say it him, then he says it to me, I said, let's give up. And then we never even… 

01:20:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Do. 

01:20:55
DOREEN Do. I mean I've had a day without it, you know, on New Year's day and it doesn't lasted long and… 

01:21:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK It's something… 

01:21:00
DOREEN I've cut down. 

01:21:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK It's something you've thought about, but never really acted on. 

01:21:05
DOREEN No. 

01:21:05
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Can I, can I ask you this, if you did decide to do something about the smoking… 

01:21:10
DOREEN All right, yeah. 

01:21:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And I've promised you, I'm not gonna give you a lecture, put pressure on you. 

01:21:15
DOREEN No. 

01:21:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK If you did decide to give up smoking, how might that pan out? 

01:21:20
DOREEN See that's the problem. I see myself not smoking and I can't imagine, I can't imagine that I'd be happy. 

01:21:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, it's hard for you to imagine coping with life the other side. 

01:21:35
DOREEN Well, that's a bit dramatic, like coping with, I mean, I will, I would cope, I guess. But I don't know, maybe I just… My way of not coping would be to go back to cigarettes, you know. 

01:21:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, yeah. 

01:21:50
DOREEN So maybe I would… I… 

01:21:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And so it's difficult for you to imagine not having that crutch there. 

01:21:55
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:21:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. 

01:21:55
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:21:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah. And so how might you get over that if you decided to do something? 

01:22:00
DOREEN Well, it would take a lot of will power. 

01:22:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK What might you do? Right. And speak to your husband? 

01:22:05
DOREEN Speak to my husband. 

01:22:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You'd need a lot of will power. 

01:22:15
DOREEN Try and get him to give it up as well. 

01:22:15
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Get him on board. Yeah. 

01:22:20
DOREEN Yeah. I don't know how though and… 

01:22:20
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And you might or might not consider things like smoking aids that are around. I mean that's something… 

01:22:30
DOREEN There's lot of those, I know. 

01:22:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You know about those, do you? 

01:22:30
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:22:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Right, okay. 

01:22:35
DOREEN I mean, I don't know exactly what, but I know there's patches and chewing gum. 

01:22:40
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Different things that you can do. Okay, look I promised, promised you we wouldn't take long. And I know you want to get back to work, let me just quickly summarise what you've said. 

01:22:45
DOREEN All right. 

01:22:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, I want you to always feel that you can come back and, and, and talk to us about this. 

01:22:50
DOREEN Okay. 

01:22:50
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And not feel, won't make you feel bad about it. But what you've said is that's it's an important part of your social life and helps you relax. 

01:23:00
DOREEN Yeah. 

01:23:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And on the other hand, you are aware that you haven't got, you know, seven or eight decades more of this and have no health issues. I'm being a bit extreme. And that if you, if you could get your husband alongside and somehow summon the will power and may be summate it, something you might think about, but you're not quite ready. 

01:23:25
DOREEN I don't think I'm ready yet, but it is something to have a chat again about with my husband. 

01:23:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, okay. Well, and that would be my, my quite strong advice, to be really honest, is to give it some serious thought. So I didn't want you to, to walk away from here thinking that I wasn't concerned, I am, just that I know that in the end, you're the one that has to make the decisions. 

01:23:45
DOREEN Yes, definitely, yes. 

01:23:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay. 

01:23:45
DOREEN Okay, thank you. 

01:23:45
STEPHEN ROLLNICK All the best. And I'm so sorry about what happened in the waiting room. 

01:23:50
DOREEN Oh, thank you. I just hope it doesn't happen again because I just, you know, next I'd be here… 

01:23:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Try… 

01:24:00
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Okay, all the best then. Okay. Okay, and I think I'm not gonna debrief on this occasion, because I can see we've only got 5 minutes left, I think that took about 7-8 minutes. She didn't quite move in to planning and you can see, I only took her over into that realm by asking her a hypothetical question. Basically, she's not ready. You'll also notice that my dance steps were pretty good. I used quite a lot of reflection. It's quite hard to get the change talk out of her. And it was there, but… umm… I didn't want her to leave there feeling that I was just some kind of easy going guy who didn't mind what she did. So I made that very clear at the end. But I assume that my, my, my engagement with her was sufficiently good for me to say that from my heart to her heart, and she got it, because she knows that in the end, it's gonna be her choice. So I think that was reasonable, not a bad example of evoking. And I think by way of conclusion, I'd just like to touch on a couple of other general extra points that, that I have prepared to talk to you about that are not on the slides. So at this point, I'd like to thank you, Jeanine, unless there's anything else you want to say? 

01:25:25
JEANINE No. nothing about the slide. 

01:25:25
STEPHEN ROLLNICK You felt okay after that, after that, yeah? 

01:25:30
JEANINE Yes. I think, if you want me to feedback? 

01:25:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, okay, feedback. 

01:25:30
JEANINE And I felt that we had established a rapport by that time. And although I didn't want to talk about the smoking, you know, to have, like, a change talk about the smoking, really, it was, it was good for me to discuss and get it clear in my mind with somebody who wasn't judging me. 

01:25:55
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, okay. 

01:25:55
JEANINE So it sort of put the seeds into my mind, to go home to talk to my husband, because we've done it before. So, you know, we have got to that stage before so this time we might, may go over that, you know, go past that stage, just thinking about it and do it. 

01:26:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK And I will take that down in the notes, you see. 

01:26:10
JEANINE Yeah. 

01:26:10
STEPHEN ROLLNICK So that we've got some continuity of care. So the next time she comes back, I know there's been a discussion about it. Ideally, if she sees me, it'll be that much easier to raise the subject. So continuity of care in chronic disease is, is, is hugely valuable. Okay, well, thank you very, very much. 

01:26:25
JEANINE Thank you. 

01:26:30
STEPHEN ROLLNICK Yeah, thanks for you time. Okay, you know, I'm conscious of the fact that, that I haven't touched on the question of research evidence. And I'd like to mention that briefly. I'd also like to tell you that hot off the press, very soon is a new book called Motivational Interviewing in Diabetes Care, written by two people, William Miller, the co… the founder of Motivational Interviewing as one of the authors, as is another physician. These, these people know the diabetes world intimately. And I've had the privilege of, of being sort of an editor of that book. And I've had a look through it and it's jam packed with experience of the field and practical advice. So I would say in about nine months time, that book will be available. What does the research show? There's two ways of looking at evidence here, and I wanted to point to them both, I think they're equally important. The first is a bit loose in its use of the word evidence, which is the patient in front of you. In other words, if you're looking for evidence for the effected on else of what you're doing, look at the response of the patient. If it's not very good, that's evidence for you to shift your style. So it's a very loose use of the word evidence. But I really feel that our patients are our best teachers in that respect. In terms of actual formal research, there have been over 200 controlled trials of Motivational Interviewing, mostly in healthcare settings, handful or more in the diabetes fields, and most of them successful, most of them effective, but not all. I've been involved in a couple, it's tough research to do because you have to measure this kind of interaction and that's difficult in a large scale clinical trial. And I think the, the, the, the research field has not quite caught up methodologically with the need to tape record the consultations, to analyze them. So I don't want to say that Motivational Interviewing is affective in diabetes care, I believe it is. I believe there's something there. And I think the critical ingredient, actually, is the decision that you take about what kind of style you're comfortable in using yourself. And if you, if you find this style attractive, I think you can be confident, you'll do people no harm and that there's a reasonable degree of research behind you. I wanted to make a brief comment about time, which is, which is brilliantly timed because I've got a minute left. And I want to talk about what do you when you're short of time. I think the more stressed you are, the shorter you feel with time, the less time you feel you have. And it's really strange, but I've noticed this in practitioners that I've seen as the patient and that I've worked with as a, as a trainer of medical students and nurses. The really great… The really great physicians and nurses are ones who behave like they're not rushed. And I believe that if… I've tried to do it a couple of times in this, in this seminar, it's not easy, that if you, if you slow down and choose your words really carefully, you don't feel so rushed and you can actually make quicker progress. And in many senses, I do appreciate that, that you're short of time in your practice. But do maybe consider the way I've formulated that, which is, if you slow down, your practice can be much faster. Okay, well, I think I've reached the end of the 90 minutes that I've had with you. I suspect many of you are moving towards lunch time. Thank you so much for you time and attention, this morning. And I, I wish you lots of luck in your careers and in your practice, and most important, with the patients that you serve. Thank you very much.
