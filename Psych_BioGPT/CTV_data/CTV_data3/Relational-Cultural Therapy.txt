Relational Cultural Therapy with Tanya R. Hammer Ph.D., LPC-S 

00:00:35
TANYA R. HAMMER In learning about Relational Cultural Theory, or Therapy, the best place to start is at the beginning. In 1976, a book was written by Jean Baker Miller um, psychiatrist. Um, when she was in her residency at Columbia University training to become a psychiatrist, working with female patients, she found that traditional models of development did not fit um, the problems that she was encountering. So she started doing some research with regards to what really was going on for women and comparing that with the traditional models like Erickson and Piaget and Freud, and put out a book called, "Toward a New Psychology of Women" in 1976, which started the journey towards where Relational Cultural Theory is today. 

00:01:15
FOUNDING SCHOLARS: Jean Baker Miller, Judith Jordan, Irene Stiver, Jan Surrey 

00:01:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Um, after the publication of that book in 1976, a group of women: um, Judy Jordan, Jan Surrey, Jean Baker Miller and Irene Stiver begin meeting um, twice a month in 1977. They started talking about the problems that they were encountering with their female patients that they just couldn't um, work with the traditional models of development. And they because the founding scholars of Relational Cultural Theory which uh, was housed at the Stone Center in Boston um, and has developed into numerous works and, including books, publications, journals, it's been cited in dissertations, and continues to grow. 

00:01:55
Applications: Individual Therapy, Group Work, Work with Additctions, Work with Eating Disorders, Working with Men, With Couples, With Families 

00:01:55
TANYA R. HAMMER It's applied now to supervision, to group work, to working with addictions, eating disorders, and also to working with men, and couples, and families. 

00:02:05
BASIC CONCEPTS OF DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY 

00:02:05
We live, grow and have our being in relationships. 

00:02:05
Traditional models emphasize individuation and autonomy as healthy concepts 

00:02:05
Relational Cultural Theory speaks to relational development and across the lifespan 

00:02:05
Aim is for relational competence 

00:02:05
Examines need for growth fostering relationships 

00:02:05
TANYA R. HAMMER What the basic concepts of RCT are that make it different from traditional models of development and therapy is that it looks a the fact that we live, grow and have our being in relationships. We yearn for connection and that's where we grow and we change. As opposed to traditional models of development that look at um, growing towards individuation and autonomy. What we should be striving for in our lives and how we grow and change is through developing relational competence. And that that is so important in all of our relationships, not just with significant others but with family members, with people we work with. And so by examining where we stand in relationship and how we grow and change, we look at how we develop within perspective, over the lifespan. If we are experiencing truly growth-fostering relationships, which I will explain um, the concept a little bit further in a moment, then we are um, experiencing what will probably be referred to as mentally healthy situations. 

00:03:05
FIVE GOOD THINGS (MILLER, J.B.,1976) 

00:03:05
Zest - sense of energy 

00:03:05
Empowerment 

00:03:05
Charity - Sense of purpose and direction 

00:03:05
Sense of Value in Relationship 

00:03:05
Desire for more connections 

00:03:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Jean Baker Miller coined the phrase, "Five Good Things" um, when looking at growth-fostering relationships. That if it's actually a healthy, growth-fostering relationship, these five good things will be present. The first is zest, and this just a sense of energy, a sense of enthusiasm. Um, the second is empowerment, you, you feel that you have strength from those relationships and are empowered to take action. The third good thing is a sense of clarity, a sense of purpose and a sense of direction. Um, the fourth good thing um, of, of the five um, is a sense of um, self worth. But rather than a sense of self worth, because Relational Cultural Theory re-coins or re-terms a lot of things from the sense of self to the sense of relationship. So rather than just a sense of self worth, it's a sense of worth within relationships, that you matter to other people, that you are important. And the final thing um, is that if you are in those healthy growth-fostering relationships, there is a sense and desire to be in other connections, other relationships um, and to not distance yourself from people. What's important to happen and key terms to understand when looking at whether or not these relationships are present in your life, but also striving to find those relationships, the first thing that RCT really talks about and looks at is the concept of authenticity. 

00:04:30
AUTHENTICITY 

00:04:30
Being seen for who one really is 

00:04:30
Being willing to risk 

00:04:30
A willingness to be vulnerable 

00:04:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Um, it's that ability to really be who you are. Um, to risk being vulnerable with other people, to step out and say that no matter who I am um, either the person will like me or will not like me. But it's important that I be true to who I am, and to be authentic in those relationships so that when you are connecting with another person, it is truly who is connecting with them. Um, a second thing to understand with looking at the relationships from an RCT perspective, is the concept of empathy. 

00:05:05
EMPATHY 

00:05:05
Anticipatory Empathy - You will impact those who you enter into relationship with good, bad or otherwise. 

00:05:05
Mutual Empathy - Honoring that we are impacting each other and respecting those we are in relationship with 

00:05:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Um, and it's looked at in two different ways. The first is anticipatory empathy, the understanding that when we enter into a relationship with someone, we are going to impact them and they are going to impact us. We make a difference in each other's lives, good, bad or otherwise. But that there is going to be a change, an effect and hopefully, if it's a healthy relationship, there will be growth. The second concept under empathy is just mutual empathy, is that, honoring that fact that you are impacting each other, that you are changing each other. And of you go into the relationship with that sense of authenticity, that sense of understanding that we do impact each other, with that empathy, both anticipatory and mutual, that then there is a sense mutuality, a sense of growth together and change together. But change and growth from starting from who you really are, not from who you think you need to be to be in relationship with that person. Those are the things that exist within what would be a healthy, growth-fostering relationship. Now, when we look at Relational Cultural Theory in therapy and action, we're starting to examine when those things do not exist. So what are the obstacles to that mutuality and to that relationship? 

00:06:25
OBSTACLES TO MUTUALITY 

00:06:25
'isms - Racism, genderism, heterosexism, ageism, etc. 

00:06:25
Relational Images: Own expectations and fears, Past relationships 

00:06:25
Controlling Images: Societal expectations, Dominant group, Marginalization 

00:06:25
TANYA R. HAMMER And those obstacles include things like, we refer to them as the 'isms, but just things like classism, and genderism, and sexism, and um, and just the things that create barriers between us. Because, because I am a woman, I feel like I can't truly be who I am when I enter into relationship with another woman or a man because they won't really accept me for who I am, so that can create that obstacle of mutuality and understanding. If it's possibly ageism, because I'm older or I'm younger, if it's um, heterosexism, if it's because of your sexual orientation, that you feel that you can't be truly who you are. Um, it's also not just those, it's not just those obstacles to mutuality, but it's also a concept called relational images that have to be understood and examined. And those are our own expectations and fears that have developed because of past relationships that can create obstacles because we're afraid that if we're truly who we are, we won't be accepted because quite possibly in our past, when we were who, who we thought we were, we weren't accepted. We were rejected, possibly by parents, possibly by another loved one, or by others in authority over us. And so we have internalized those concepts and these relational images have formed. And along with the relational images that have possibly formed for someone, there's also controlling images at work which are societal expectations for our roles in relationships. Past um, other concepts and theories would have referred to them possibly as stereotypes um, but controlling images are, are talked about through a lens of power and dominance. That those in power keep these images there so that, to hold down um, to hold down those below them because they like the status quo. So it's a societal expectations for your role as a woman, your role as a man. Um, if you are um, let's say a male who is more sensitive um, than there's the societal expectation for the possibility that you don't, you're not truly a man, and so you feel like you can't be who you really are in relationship because of those societal expectations. And so all of those obstacles, whether it is the 'isms um, or are the, the relational images or the controlling images, go to work to create what would be unhealthy relations cuz they're the obstacles to mutuality. And so when we talked about the five good things that are experienced in healthy relationships, in opposition to that and what will most often be examined in therapeutic situations, are when those things do not exist and you have the opposite of the five good things. 

00:09:10
RESULTS OF OBSTACLES 

00:09:10
Opposite of Five Good Things 

00:09:10
Lack of energy 

00:09:10
Less ability to take action 

00:09:10
Sense of confusion 

00:09:10
Decreased sense of mattering 

00:09:10
Isolation - Chronic isolation results in depression and other mental health issues. 

00:09:10
TANYA R. HAMMER You have a lack of energy. You have a sense of uh, just kind of depletion of energy and depletion of power. You don't want to act. You don't want to do anything because, what's the point? There's a sense of confusion. Where am I going? What am I doing? Why am I really um, trying to be in relationship with people because it doesn't really work? Um, there's also this sense of, that you don't matter in relationship, that your opinion doesn't count, that you're not valued. And then there's, then what happens with that is, is a sense of isolation. You separate from people. Even though we desire to be in connection with people, that, that sense of not mattering causes you to isolate which leads to chronic isolation, which can lead to depression and other mental health disorders that might bring the client to the counseling office. When they have that sense of isolation um, there's a concept that is presented in RCT that quite possibly is happening, and it's referred to as the Central Relational Paradox. Even though we desire and yearn to be in connection with others, we, we will use strategies of disconnection, self-protective measures. I know that if I'm who I am they're not going to accept me, so I'm going to do everything I can to prove that, or to reject them before they reject me. Um, and so those strategies of disconnection are um, are things that we'll do that, that create again, go back to creating those obstacles to mutuality, along with the relational images and the controlling images. And so when these things are going on, and the person's brought into the counseling office, then the goals of therapy when you're working with them, are first to name and to deconstruct the things that are going on in their life, possibly those relational images that they formed early in life. Um, and also to take a look at the controlling images that are work, are at work from a cultural standpoint, from a religious or spiritual standpoint which is part of that cultural standpoint. Um, age, you know, what are their, what generational, what's happened in their family? And to look at those things and how those things have built up, and to really examine them with, with the client. To talk to the client about um, relational movement and relational growth, and the fact that yes, sometimes we have, we disconnect in relationship but that's not, that doesn't mean the relationship is over. What we need to do is to be able to hold that discomfort that comes with disconnection and work through it to reconnect in the relationship. Usually if you hold through that, that, that time of discomfort, the relationship is stronger on the other side. And what you're striving for, as far as in counseling with a client, is ultimately for them to become for relationally competent. The first healthy, growth-fostering relationship they may have experienced is with the therapist in that, in the, in the therapeutic relationship. And so you're trying to help them to learn to be more relationally competent, to be authentic, to be who they are, to understand that mutual empathy, and then to translate that from the therapeutic session in the office to outside with their other relationships. And to realize when there are, even though they want to be in connection, how detrimental it is to them it is if they are in an unhealthy relationship. And that it is okay to disconnect, that they're worth more than that, and they deserve to be in those healthy relationships. Now, as a therapist who's working with someone with, through this model, through Relational Cultural Theory, you have to be willing yourself to examine your own strategies of disconnection that you use, your own fears, possible relational images that you have developed. As therapists, we want to be liked. We want our clients to like us. But, and you're going to open yourself up more because you're also understanding that you are impacting them but they're impacting you. There's that risk and vulnerability that you have, that when you become authentic as the therapist and you name times when maybe you don't understand or you, you were mistaken. Be willing to say you're sorry, to name when you did something in a therapeutic session that you shouldn't have done. Because you need to remain authentic and not gloss over when there have been errors or there have been times that you went somewhere you shouldn't have gone. Don't gloss over it as, as the therapist because you need to be authentic in who you are as well, modeling that for the client and in that relationship, so they understand that it's okay um, and to talk through those things, and that they matter enough to be honest, for you to be that honest and that authentic within the relationship. And be sure that you're aware as the therapist of your own cultural um, understandings and when you don't and to, when you don't understand the culture of your client, to be honest about that because you need to be sure that's, you know, Relational Cultural Theory, it's, it's in there, it's important. And that we look at things through the lens of our client, not our own lens and not our own understanding, but through the lens of their own culture, and their own circumstance, and their own situation. It very much functions from, not the therapist is the expert, but that we're coming in this and we're sharing power with each other. That there's very much a collaboration through this process and that's so important to understand. And that just being able to name that, recognize that and work through that. And it's also important that you consult with, that you network with other therapists who practice from this, this theory, so that you're there to support each other as well. Because it is, you're opening yourself up more than you would in traditional models of therapy, and you're also taking that risk and that vulnerability that we are saying is necessary in all relationships and is necessary for that relationship or any relationship to grow. So you're modeling the theory while using the theory um, for your own development and your own purpose. 

00:15:15
THERAPIST'S RESPONSIBILITIES 

00:15:15
Be aware of personal strengths, weaknesses and developmental vulnerabilities 

00:15:15
Understand your blind spots regarding cultural competence 

00:15:15
Know where your fears resonate 

00:15:15
Know your own relational competence

Counseling Session with Angelica, using RCT 

00:15:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Um, hello, Angelica. I'm glad to see you. Um, my name's Tanya um, and uh, and everything. And so we're gonna be talking a little bit today. Um, you'd said on your paperwork that um, you're having some difficulties with, I believe it was Edward, your boyfriend? 

00:16:00
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:16:00
TANYA R. HAMMER You want to tell me a little bit about what's going on? 

00:16:05
ANGELICA Well, we've been together for about a year. And at the beginning, everything, we seemed to be going, you know, perfect, we were doing great. But now we seem to be fighting more. He's always frustrated and we just, we don't seem to be getting along very well right now and I... 

00:16:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Has he kind of told you what frustrates him? I mean, what, what happened the last time? Kind of talk to me about the last situation where y'all got in a fight. 

00:16:25
ANGELICA Well we were, you know, we were just going to go out to eat, and he was trying to figure out where we wanted to go, and he was asking me for my opinion, and, you know, it didn't matter. I told him it was, wherever he wanted to go was fine. I just, it didn't matter, it was okay. 

00:16:40
TANYA R. HAMMER So, just whatever he wanted to do, it didn't matter to you at all. What frustrated him about that situation, do you think? Did he tell you? I mean what... 

00:16:45
ANGELICA Yeah. He says that I never tell him what I want to do but, you know, whatever he wants to do is fine. 

00:16:50
TANYA R. HAMMER So you never tell him, he says you never tell him what you want to do. So has this happened in things other than choosing where you're gonna go eat? 

00:17:00
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. He says it happens all the time but I don't think so. 

00:17:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So has he kinda given you any examples or, other than just that, or does he just say, "You never tell me anything." 

00:17:10
ANGELICA Well he says I just don't tell him what want, like he just says that I just let him do whatever and it bothers him that I'm not open. 

00:17:20
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Um, have you, is, how long have y'all been together now, you said about a year? 

00:17:20
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:17:25
TANYA R. HAMMER And um, and everything and so you said this has been going on uh, would you say not from the beginning, but just as you've gotten closer um, has this become more difficult kind of thing? Has it gotten worse as far as um, how he feels you respond to him? 

00:17:40
ANGELICA I guess, I don't know if it got worse or if just bothers him more now. 

00:17:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Has he said where he things your relationship should be, um? 

00:17:50
ANGELICA Well he just said he wants me to feel like, you know, he wants me to do things I want to do, too. He just doesn't want to do everything he wants. 

00:17:55
TANYA R. HAMMER Do you feel like you do everything he wants? And don't do what you want to do? 

00:18:00
ANGELICA Sometimes. 

00:18:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Um, is, is, how many, is you're your first significant relationship or have you had others? 

00:18:10
ANGELICA Um, it's probably just my second major relationship, really. I've had, you know, just... 

00:18:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:18:15
ANGELICA Other smaller relationships but nothing really going anywhere. 

00:18:15
TANYA R. HAMMER So does this happen when y'all talk about important things, other than where you're gonna go eat um, and everything, as far as when you have more serious conversations do you think? 

00:18:30
ANGELICA I guess I generally let him decide. 

00:18:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Decide, have you done that in the past? Is this something that you're just doing with him or um, or has this happened in past relationships, whether, whether a significant other or just people that you've been in relationship with in your life? 

00:18:45
ANGELICA Um, I guess so. 

00:18:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Family, friends, you know. 

00:18:50
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean, I guess I have done that in the past. I just... 

00:18:55
TANYA R. HAMMER Can you think of a time, or a situation? 

00:19:00
ANGELICA I guess I just don't really, sometimes I just don't tell him because I don't think he'll care or it won't matter. 

00:19:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. So you, you feel like what you want to do doesn't matter to him. Has he done anything um, in the past to, to indicate that he feels that way? Or do you feel like that's something that's just coming from you? Or do you sense it from him? 

00:19:25
ANGELICA I guess he really hasn't done anything to really make me feel that way. I think it's just maybe what I expect? 

00:19:35
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. So have you had that happen in other relationships in your life, where you feel like what you want to do um, doesn't matter? 

00:19:50
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean, when I was younger, you know, my family, my sister and my parents, I felt like I didn't matter a lot. Like, it didn't matter what I wanted, or what I needed. 

00:20:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Can you kinda talk to me about your, your home life as far as, since you talked about your sister and your family, can you kinda talk to me about what it was for Angelica to grow up? What was going on? 

00:20:15
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. Well I'm one of six kids and I'm the third oldest. I have two older sisters. 

00:20:20
TANYA R. HAMMER So the middle child. Yeah. 

00:20:25
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. So middle child, and um, my older sisters were always um, getting into trouble, doing things they weren't supposed to, pretty heavy into drugs and alcohol. 

00:20:35
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:20:35
ANGELICA And, you know, my parents really didn't pay much attention to me in general. I was the quiet one, the good one I guess. 

00:20:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:20:45
ANGELICA So I didn't maybe need as much of their attention, and... 

00:20:50
TANYA R. HAMMER Or they felt like, that you didn't need as much? 

00:20:55
ANGELICA I don't, I mean honestly I don't know what they felt like. I guess I thought maybe that's why the didn't pay as much attention to me. 

00:21:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:21:05
ANGELICA And then... 

00:21:05
TANYA R. HAMMER And how did, how did you feel when that was happening? 

00:21:05
ANGELICA I felt like I didn't matter, like I wasn't important. 

00:21:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. And so um, what else was going on, as far as with uh, with your sisters and your family and everything else? 

00:21:20
ANGELICA My oldest sister um, she just didn't treat me well at all. She, she bullied me. She was, you know, she called me names, made me feel terrible about myself, even to the point where she made it really difficult for my other siblings to even interact with me because when they tried to reach out to me she, you know, would verbally, if not physically, attack them. 

00:21:50
TANYA R. HAMMER And what, where were your parents in all of this? 

00:21:50
ANGELICA Well my dad was never home to begin with. He, I mean with six kids, he worked a lot. 

00:21:55
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:21:55
ANGELICA All the time so I never really say him much anyway. Um, with my mom, she was there but... 

00:22:05
TANYA R. HAMMER It's interesting the way you just said that. You kinda got really soft on the word "there." She was there, but kinda, what were you feeling when you just described that? 

00:22:15
ANGELICA Like it just didn't mean what it, like, there. I mean, she wasn't really, she was physically there but she wasn't there for me. 

00:22:25
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. And so what are some of the things that your sister kid. I know that maybe difficult to kind of talk about, but just to kinda get a perspective of what was going on for you as a child. Um, and what age would you say was, let's say, what age was probably like the worst growing up, as far as, with regards to your relationship with your sister? 

00:22:45
ANGELICA Well honestly, I think it got progressively worse. 

00:22:50
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. 

00:22:50
ANGELICA It kinda started maybe when I was in fifth grade, and it got worse as I got older, she got older. 

00:22:55
TANYA R. HAMMER So the time when you were really, as far as developmentally kind of, the importance of peers in your, in your, your siblings and everything else, and your kind of, when you're learning who you are in relationships with others and everything else. So that's about the time when it was probably the worst then? 

00:23:10
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:23:10
TANYA R. HAMMER So what were some examples of some of the things that she did um, to you? 

00:23:15
ANGELICA She just was always ridiculing me. She always had something terrible to say to me, you know. I'm stupid. I'm ugly. No one loves me. I'm not important. I don't matter. That I should just, you know, die already cuz it just wouldn't make a difference. 

00:23:35
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. That must have been really difficult, I mean to go through. To have someone here who supposedly should be part of your family that cares about you and talk to you that way um, and everything. What kind of response did you get from your other family members? Um, did they hear this or see it? 

00:23:55
ANGELICA Well my siblings, I mean, they saw it. And my older sisters, cuz I have two older sisters um, she kind of played into it a little bit. 

00:24:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Was this a younger sister that did this or an older sister? 

00:24:10
ANGELICA Um, my two older sisters. 

00:24:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Okay. 

00:24:10
ANGELICA My oldest sister... 

00:24:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Was the... 

00:24:10
ANGELICA Michelle, she was really the one, the initiator of all of it I guess. And Samantha kind of took her side I guess, because it seemed like if they took mine they became a target, too. 

00:24:25
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:24:25
ANGELICA So it was safer to be on her side. 

00:24:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Kinda created this, this difficult environment for everyone. 

00:24:30
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:24:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Within the house as far as the kids growing up. And you said that your dad wasn't really there, and your mom really wasn't there either but, you know. 

00:24:40
ANGELICA She just didn't believe me that anything was happening because at first, Michelle... 

00:24:45
TANYA R. HAMMER So you did try to talk to her about what was going on? 

00:24:50
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. It just didn't seem to matter, that I was making a big deal out of nothing, and nothing was happening. 

00:24:55
TANYA R. HAMMER So you were getting the sense of, if you were who you were with your sister, with your mom, or anything like that, that you were kind of being um, that it didn't matter. Um, that's the language that you used, because you didn't matter. Um, how do you feel, how did you respond to that outside of your home? I mean, did you take those kind of images with you to school and your other relationships at that time? 

00:25:20
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean honestly, I didn't really have very many like, super close friends. I mean, I had friends but, you know, like I knew more about them than they knew about me. And you know, I couldn't bring them home. 

00:25:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:25:35
ANGELICA I didn't tell them what was going on. 

00:25:35
TANYA R. HAMMER So you couldn't even bring friends home? Was that just because of the environment you felt you were bringing them into or were there restrictions that your family placed? 

00:25:45
ANGELICA There weren't restrictions. It was I didn't want them to see how she treated me. 

00:25:50
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. And so now you go, you, you get this sense from your family and from your sister and, and everything else that, that who Angelica is, is somehow um, doesn't matter, or is... 

00:26:05
ANGELICA Unlovable even. 

00:26:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. So you go through life with this affecting obviously a lot of your relationships, because you said you didn't really have friends um, kind of thing. 

00:26:15
ANGELICA Not really close. Like, they could talk to me but I really, embarrassed even to talk to them about what was going on. So, I mean more recently, friends have had, you know, since intermediate school know everything, but back then I couldn't. 

00:26:30
TANYA R. HAMMER What made those friends that you could share with different? What changed as far as um, well let's take. Okay. Let's move forward through the years. Let's talk about Edward. Something about him at least drew you to him, to enter into a more significant relationship with. What, was there a difference there? 

00:26:50
ANGELICA Just how much he cares about everybody. Everybody matters to him. 

00:27:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So you see that he, he demonstrates that others matter and everything else. 

00:27:00
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:27:05
TANYA R. HAMMER But yet you still seem, you struggle with thinking that you matter to him? 

00:27:10
ANGELICA I guess I wonder if, cuz he doesn't really know it, you know, what happened when I was younger. I feel like, if he really knows me, that maybe he'll see the same thing they did. 

00:27:25
TANYA R. HAMMER So you haven't been able to, have you been able to share what happened with, really with anyone before coming in here? 

00:27:30
ANGELICA I have one or two friends that kind of, I mean not in real detail, just that she was terrible to me. I haven't really said, you know, described to them any of it really. 

00:27:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Did you ever get any kind of validation, as far as from your parents about what was going on? 

00:27:45
ANGELICA No. My mom, nothing happened. I was making a big deal out of nothing. I was being sensitive. I should, even at one point, I should stop doing what I'm doing to make her mad. 

00:28:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So you were, you were ashamed and you were given... 

00:28:00
ANGELICA It was my fault. 

00:28:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah, and everything. And so how do you think that's affected you as you enter into relationships with people? 

00:28:10
ANGELICA Honestly I find it really hard to trust people, to expect them to... 

00:28:15
TANYA R. HAMMER What do you think's gonna happen if you're, if you, what's the, what's the worst thing for you that would happen, if you were to open up and, and trust? 

00:28:25
ANGELICA That they would not be there or betray that trust because I haven't really had people I can trust, you know, the people you should trust the most, your parents and your, my siblings. I couldn't trust them. 

00:28:45
TANYA R. HAMMER So do you still not trust them today, anything change in those relationships? 

00:28:50
ANGELICA Um, my younger sister and I have kind of reconnected more um, because it was really hard to be close with, I mean, with any of them simply because they became a target trying to be close to me. 

00:29:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:29:00
ANGELICA And they were younger, you know, they had to protect themselves. I get that. 

00:29:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. So do you feel that you also, did you feel the need to protect them as well? Do you think that that affected maybe how you um, related to them? 

00:29:15
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean I did everything I could to protect them because I didn't, they didn't deserve to be treated that way, any, you know, it just... 

00:29:20
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:29:20
ANGELICA They didn't do anything. 

00:29:25
TANYA R. HAMMER So fast forward to your relationship with Edward. 

00:29:30
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Talk to me about how y'all met and how your relationship developed. 

00:29:35
ANGELICA Well I mean, we met when I was in high school originally. Um, we both worked at Wendy's in the mall so, you know, it was my first job. 

00:29:40
TANYA R. HAMMER Bonding over fast food. 

00:29:40
ANGELICA (laughing) Yeah. So he was just really sweet. He was just a great guy, you know, we were friends, we joked around. We knew each other um, two years I think before we both just went our separate ways to other jobs. And then um, I came back from my first year in Dallas um, for college and we met, we went out with, I went out with friends and we just met up. Um, he happened to be there with his own group of friends and we... 

00:30:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Reconnected. 

00:30:10
ANGELICA Reconnected, yeah. 

00:30:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. And so how has that relationship developed over, you said you've been together for what, a year now? 

00:30:15
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:15
TANYA R. HAMMER So how has that relationship developed, say differently than other relationships that you've had? You said that you were drawn to him because of how much he cares about everyone um, but question how much he cares about you, um. 

00:30:35
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. I don't know if that's, like he's never done anything to make me think he doesn't care. It's... 

00:30:40
TANYA R. HAMMER In fact it seems to me the opposite in the sense he wants to know more about you. That's what you, you know, said. He wants to know your opinion. He's frustrated because you never share your opinion um, which would seem to demonstrate you know, on his part, that he does, um. 

00:30:55
ANGELICA I just wonder if I can be me, if that's okay, if he'll like me. 

00:31:00
TANYA R. HAMMER How do you think it would be different, what do you think will happen if you, I want to say, if you are you? But um, do you want to continue in the relationship not being you? 

00:31:15
ANGELICA No. I just don't know how to let him in without, I don't want to be, it's' hard to be vulnerable. I mean I was for so long. 

00:31:25
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:31:25
ANGELICA And it's really hard to go back to that. It's not that I don't want him to know, but I am a little scared on how he'll react. 

00:31:35
TANYA R. HAMMER Do you value the relationship with him so much that you really don't want to lose the relationship? 

00:31:40
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:31:40
TANYA R. HAMMER But you're struggling with really being who you are in the relationship. 

00:31:45
ANGELICA Yeah. I know it sounds, I, when you say that I hear the contradiction. 

00:31:50
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. So what goes through your head when you hear that contradiction? Kind of what's the thought process going on for you? 

00:32:00
ANGELICA Why can't I accept that he does care and it would be okay? 

00:32:05
TANYA R. HAMMER And what's the worst that would happen? 

00:32:05
ANGELICA That he would leave and would, you know would not like me, like real me. 

00:32:15
TANYA R. HAMMER But yet you're with him now and he doesn't really know the real you. So how does that feel? When you think about that, the fact that you're worried about him leaving if he knows the real you, but yet he's staying with you not knowing the real you, are you comfortable with that? 

00:32:40
ANGELICA No. 

00:32:40
TANYA R. HAMMER So have, do you, can you think of a relationship that you've been in where you were you? 

00:32:45
ANGELICA Well, I guess with my friendship with Deanna. I mean she's known me forever. 

00:32:55
TANYA R. HAMMER And how, how does that relationship feel? 

00:33:00
ANGELICA I mean, I guess... 

00:33:00
TANYA R. HAMMER How's spending time with her feel? 

00:33:00
ANGELICA She just, you know, makes, I enjoy spending time with her. I feel good about myself. I feel... 

00:33:10
TANYA R. HAMMER So even though you're you, and you have shared with her...At least have you shared with her part of what happened, as far as with your family? 

00:33:20
ANGELICA Not in great detail, but she knows. 

00:33:20
TANYA R. HAMMER But enough to know kind of, get a sense of what happened? 

00:33:25
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:33:25
TANYA R. HAMMER And so what made you decide to trust her? 

00:33:30
ANGELICA I don't know if it was so much a decision as, you know, she, you know, she did come over to my house once, and we had to pick something up for school. And she saw how Michelle treated me, and she asked me about it. It wasn't something I could really not say. I mean you can't, I couldn't pretend it didn't happen. I could with everybody else. 

00:34:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So she actually witnessed first-hand um, and everything and then confronted you about it. How did that feel when she did? 

00:34:10
ANGELICA It was scary, and I was embarrassed that she knew. 

00:34:10
TANYA R. HAMMER And what did she do with the information and the situation? How did she respond, Dianna (sp)? 

00:34:20
ANGELICA Deanna. 

00:34:20
TANYA R. HAMMER Deanna. Okay. 

00:34:20
ANGELICA You know, she just was there and you know, told me I didn't deserve that. That no one should treat me that way, that I... 

00:34:30
TANYA R. HAMMER So she made you feel as if you mattered. 

00:34:30
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:34:35
TANYA R. HAMMER And how long have y'all been friends? 

00:34:35
ANGELICA Since intermediate school. 

00:34:40
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. So how, how does that relationship... I'm gonna ask this question again and I know we already talked about this, but I want you to think about it. How does that relationship make you feel? 

00:34:50
ANGELICA Important, like someone cares. 

00:34:55
TANYA R. HAMMER And um, is that, and so there's an example of how that makes you feel. How does it make you feel in relationship with Edward, when you feel like you can't trust him, and you're not being who you are? How do you feel in that relationship, when you think about it? 

00:35:10
ANGELICA I always feel unsure. Should I, should say, should I tell him what I think? Should I, would it be okay? Can I do it? I'm afraid. 

00:35:20
TANYA R. HAMMER Do you feel as if you're worth the kind of relationship that you have with Deanna? 

00:35:25
ANGELICA Not all the time. 

00:35:30
TANYA R. HAMMER What are those feelings? What are those moments? What's happening then? 

00:35:30
ANGELICA Well I mean, I still interact with my family. I can't not be around them. 

00:35:40
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. So is it times when you're around your family, that then you start to feel that way again... and everything. 

00:35:45
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:35:45
TANYA R. HAMMER And everything. So you said you can't not be around them. Y'all have like family events, and things like that. Is that when it happens? 

00:35:50
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:35:55
TANYA R. HAMMER So where is Edward when you have these family events and times? Has he been around your family? 

00:36:00
ANGELICA A little bit, not that much. 

00:36:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Not that much. You kind of keep him from that so he doesn't... 

00:36:05
ANGELICA Yeah. Cuz I just, I guess... 

00:36:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Explain that. 

00:36:10
ANGELICA I mean like, maybe I'm afraid of the same thing like with Deanna, that he'll see how I'm treated. He'll see what's going on. 

00:36:15
TANYA R. HAMMER But what happened when Deanna found out? 

00:36:20
ANGELICA She told me that I didn't deserve that, that I didn't... 

00:36:25
TANYA R. HAMMER And did y'all get closer after that? 

00:36:30
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:36:30
TANYA R. HAMMER So what, why do you feel you're hesitating with Edward? 

00:36:35
ANGELICA I guess because I have some control over it. With Deanna it just happened. 

00:36:40
TANYA R. HAMMER It just happened. 

00:36:40
ANGELICA Yeah. I wasn't intentional. It just was more of an accident, I guess. 

00:36:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Is Deanna probably the only person that that's really happened with? That really knows or saw first-hand, that you're in relationship with? 

00:36:55
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean beyond my siblings. I mean clearly they've seen it. 

00:36:55
TANYA R. HAMMER Do you have any, a good relationship with any other siblings? 

00:37:00
ANGELICA My younger sister, we're still trying to kind of get there. 

00:37:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Is this apart from the family kind of? 

00:37:05
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:37:05
TANYA R. HAMMER So outside of the other relationships and everything? 

00:37:10
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:37:10
TANYA R. HAMMER So as far as, what do you think...Let's say just knowing who Edward is, you told me he cares about everybody, he makes everybody feel as if they matter and everything else, play out for me what you think would happen if he were to see. Put him in Deanna's place and play out the same thing. How do you think he would respond in that situation? 

00:37:40
ANGELICA I guess he would be upset for me. I mean he doesn't like to see people being treated poorly. 

00:37:50
TANYA R. HAMMER So do you think he would come to your defense? 

00:37:55
ANGELICA Probably. 

00:37:55
TANYA R. HAMMER You seem hesitant. What's going through your mind? What are you... 

00:38:00
ANGELICA I mean, I guess I've seen him react that way with others, when he's seen them, people not treating them right. I just, there's still that fear that that's not, I mean that that won't happen. 

00:38:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:38:10
ANGELICA That he might react differently even though, I guess normally he doesn't. 

00:38:15
TANYA R. HAMMER So what, why do you think, what do you think makes you different? That he would react differently than he reacts with everybody else? 

00:38:20
ANGELICA I don't know. I guess sometimes I feel like I don't matter as much as everybody else. So maybe I'm different somehow. Not it a good way. 

00:38:35
TANYA R. HAMMER So let's just, what would be the worst, that he wouldn't defend you? 

00:38:45
ANGELICA That he would be okay that it was happening, that it was, he'd respond like my mom did, you know, it's not a big deal. You're being ridiculous. You're being too sensitive. That he would be okay that it's happening. 

00:39:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So because of fear of that, you don't want to share with him what's happened. 

00:39:05
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean if my mom reacts that way, I mean why would he react differently? She's my mother. 

00:39:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Is he like your mom? 

00:39:15
ANGELICA No, I guess not. I mean no, I really couldn't say he's like my mom. 

00:39:25
TANYA R. HAMMER So um, think through the things that we've kind of, you know, talked about in the sense that he, he shows that he cares for everybody, he shows that he matters, that people matter and everything else. And yet you still can't trust that, and that's a good word, you still can't trust that you matter to him. What do you think it would take for you to feel as if you mattered to him? 

00:39:55
ANGELICA I guess honestly it would take him being um, me telling him or him seeing what happened, and... 

00:40:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So the very thing that you don't want to happen is what it would take for you to trust how he would respond. 

00:40:10
ANGELICA Yeah. (laughs) 

00:40:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Don't we just hate it when that happens, you know? 

00:40:15
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:40:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. So what do you think it would take for you to get to the point of, of trusting for that to happen? Obviously this relationship is important to you. 

00:40:25
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:40:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. You're here to talk about it. What do you think it would take to get you to the point to where you felt like you could trust him and share that with him? 

00:40:40
ANGELICA I don't know. I mean there's just so much, I mean even, I guess fear is the word. Like I just, I don't know how he'll respond. I hope I know how he'll respond but... 

00:40:50
TANYA R. HAMMER But let's say you could orchestrate and design the event, the time, the place. Not like what happened with Deanna where you didn't have any control, it just happened. But let's say you could set up the perfect thing to talk to him about. What would that look like? Where do you think, what do you think would need to happen? 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:20
ANGELICA I guess, maybe I'd have to tell him about it first because Michelle like, paints herself differently around other people. 

00:41:35
TANYA R. HAMMER Has he met her? 

00:41:35
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:41:35
TANYA R. HAMMER Has he said anything about how he feels about her, or how he thinks about her? 

00:41:40
ANGELICA Not really, I haven't asked. 

00:41:45
TANYA R. HAMMER So you haven't, you're afraid to ask? 

00:41:45
ANGELICA Yeah. I mean she makes herself look different to other people. I mean she doesn't treat everyone this way. It's me. 

00:41:55
TANYA R. HAMMER Does that make it worse? 

00:41:55
ANGELICA Yeah. Because sometimes I wonder you know, what did I do? What was wrong with me, to make me the target? 

00:42:05
TANYA R. HAMMER It just adds to all the feelings that you've described before, that you've just kind of internalized. 

00:42:10
ANGELICA Part of it is, I wonder if I tell him that he won't believe me. And I, I can't guarantee that he'll see her doing that because she, I mean she... 

00:42:20
TANYA R. HAMMER No. We have no control over others' reactions and what they do and everything, just how we respond and what we expect out of relationships and everything. So you're, you think that what you need to do is first, you need to sit him down, and talk to him, and tell him what happened. How would you tell him? Practice talking to me about what you might say to him about what happened. 

00:42:50
ANGELICA Honestly I don't know where I'd start. I mean... 

00:42:55
TANYA R. HAMMER Well let's go back. When you, when you first started talking, and I asked you about the last fight that y'all had, and he said that he gets frustrated because you're never willing to make the decision. He feels that you're always making a decision based on what he wants, not on what you want. So let's say that that conversation is taking place when he's not upset, and you're not upset. That you just sit down to talk, and he says, he says that to you. Um, how do you think you could use that moment to lead into maybe why you do what you do? 

00:43:30
ANGELICA I guess I could tell him like, I just, I wonder if it'll matter, you know, if he'll want to do what I want to do. If my, you know, if he'll even think it's important, what I'm saying or what decision I make. Are you going to ignore the decision? 

00:43:50
TANYA R. HAMMER And he asks you, why do you feel I'll ignore you? 

00:43:55
ANGELICA Because I have been ignored by everyone. I mean my family in particular. 

00:44:05
TANYA R. HAMMER So what's happened with your family? As if I'm him asking you that kind of question. 

00:44:15
ANGELICA Well I mean you know Michelle, my older sister, she she's just always treated me really badly always. Said terrible things, you know, making me like feel like I didn't matter. Like, like everyone hated me, and I wasn't worthy of being loved by people and... 

00:44:40
TANYA R. HAMMER But you know that I care for you, so why wouldn't you have talked to me about this? 

00:44:45
ANGELICA Because I'm scared at how you'll react. I'm scared you'll do what my mom did, like act like this didn't happen, and that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. 

00:44:55
TANYA R. HAMMER But it does matter because who you are matters. 

00:45:00
ANGELICA I guess it's hard to believe that that's true sometimes, cuz I haven't heard that very much. And people who should be telling me that aren't. 

00:45:10
TANYA R. HAMMER But if you don't talk to me about the things, then I can't tell you and answer that you do matter. 

00:45:20
ANGELICA I guess I'm just scared that if I tell you, you'll tell me I won't, I don't matter. I'm afraid of your response sometimes. I'm afraid it's gonna, you're gonna respond just like my mom and my sister have toward me. 

00:45:35
TANYA R. HAMMER But I won't. Have I done anything to show that I would respond that way? 

00:45:45
ANGELICA No. 

00:45:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Because you do matter and I want to hear from you. 

00:45:50
ANGELICA I guess I just need to believe that. And I don't, I don't know if I can do it right this second. But I mean, I can try. 

00:46:00
TANYA R. HAMMER So do you, okay. So I'm, I'm back in as, it's Tanya. So do you feel that that's a situation that could lead to that conversation, but maybe when you're not, when y'all aren't upset? If you went back to him to use that as a moment, when he talked to you as far as, you know, go back and say, okay. You asked me why I do this, and I've thought about it, and this may be connected to this. How do you feel about doing something like that? 

00:46:30
ANGELICA The thought is scary but I don't feel like that would be impossible, like it's not something I couldn't do. But I mean... 

00:46:40
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:46:40
ANGELICA Thinking about doing it is scary cuz I don't know he'll, I don't know if he'll respond the way you did. 

00:46:45
TANYA R. HAMMER Right. We have no, we don't know. Just like you, you had no control over it, you had no idea how Deanna would respond when that situation took place. But that, you now describe that as a very I mean, very healthy relationship with her. You like spending time with her. You like being around her. I think for the most part, from what you've said, when you're just around her and with her, you get a sense that you do matter, right? 

00:47:10
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Do you get a sense obviously, and I'm gonna ask this, do you get a sense that you matter around Edward? When you're not arguing, but just a sense of, you know, when things are really going right with y'all, do you feel like you matter? 

00:47:25
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:47:30
TANYA R. HAMMER How does that feel different from the times, because obviously there's times you feel like you don't matter with him, how do you feel different in those times? What's going on within you? 

00:47:40
ANGELICA Cuz I can't honestly say it's something he did, I just wonder if I really told him what I thought or what I wanted, that it would matter. 

00:47:45
TANYA R. HAMMER So you're thinking back and questioning what the conversation was, where, you know, that kind of thing. So how long, y'all said you've been together a year, do you see yourself with him in the future? 

00:48:00
ANGELICA I'd like to be. 

00:48:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Do you see yourself in the future with him as Angelica, or the person you've become in order to stay in relationship with him? 

00:48:10
ANGELICA I want to be me but I don't know how to do that without being scared. 

00:48:15
TANYA R. HAMMER It's difficult to be scared, isn't it? It's not a comfortable place to be. 

00:48:20
ANGELICA Yeah. I guess I avoid it because it, it is so uncomfortable. I mean I was, I've been scared so much. I mean growing up, it's scared all the time. 

00:48:30
TANYA R. HAMMER And so there's that, that fear, almost that expectation of fear even, of what's going to happen if you're, if you're really you, or authentic in that relationship um, and everything. It's not easy. Um, you've been that way, you said with, forced to be that way with, at least at that moment in time with Deanna, right? 

00:48:55
ANGELICA Mm-hmm. 

00:48:55
TANYA R. HAMMER But I would think that there's probably been times where you've taken that risk since that time with her. Y'all have talked about things. Have you talked to her about your relationship with Edward? 

00:49:10
ANGELICA I have, yeah. 

00:49:10
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. Have you talked to her about your fears with Edward? 

00:49:15
ANGELICA Not so much. 

00:49:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:49:15
ANGELICA I mean I should, I know, but I... 

00:49:20
TANYA R. HAMMER Are you holding back for a reason, or just because it just hasn't come up to talk to her about it? 

00:49:25
ANGELICA I guess I'm... 

00:49:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Again, scared? 

00:49:30
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:49:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. So I think that's, I mean it's a difficult, and obviously from what you've shared, I mean you had a really difficult time growing up. I mean um, with your, with Michelle and how your other siblings reacted, and your mom and dad not really being there to support, the very who, relationship with that you expect to, to protect you, to cover you, to be there. So you had to develop some strategies to protect yourself. 

00:50:00
ANGELICA Yeah, I guess. 

00:50:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. And you've kinda kept that up. 

00:50:05
ANGELICA I don't know how to turn it off. 

00:50:05
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. It's not something easy. I mean, to turn off. Um, I think it's something that we can, we can talk about more and, and really kind of explore as, as you get to know me better, cuz you've got to be able to trust and be willing to risk and be vulnerable in this relationship, as well. You know, I mean that's an important thing within here um, for you hopefully maybe this will be another relationship that you learn that you can trust in like you have with Deanna. I don't think necessarily that I'd say you're ready to go out now, and go tell Edward everything. 

00:50:45
ANGELICA No. 

00:50:45
TANYA R. HAMMER This is the first time we've talked, you know, but um, I think that maybe we can work on maybe reshaping some of those expectations and images that I see that you have of yourself because you do matter, but you need to believe that um, and everything. Um, well it's almost time for us to kind of come to a close and everything. How are you feeling right now? I just kind of what to check in with you. 

00:51:15
ANGELICA I don't know. It feels kinda good to tell someone. 

00:51:20
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. 

00:51:20
ANGELICA I like that, you know, it's something that we're gonna work on that maybe I can more forward with. 

00:51:30
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. Okay. I kinda want you to think about something before we meet the next time, and be willing to kind of do. I don't want to call it homework, okay, you know. 

00:51:40
ANGELICA I'm in school, I'm used to homework. (laughs) 

00:51:40
TANYA R. HAMMER Yeah. (laughs) Um, but um, I want you to kinda think about those times, cuz we talked about, there are times you feel like you matter more to Edward, and then there are times when you question whether you do. Um, have you ever kept any kind of journal or anything, personally? Um, do you feel like you could do that, to kind of jot down what goes through your head, maybe kind of start becoming more aware of those times when um, you do feel like you matter versus the times that you don't? And what's going on for you? Because I think from what we've talked about, it's more your own expectations and your own kind of, the way you see the relationship that's impacting and coloring that. Um, that it is, maybe even what Edward does. But kind of note down how you're feeling, what happened, the circumstance, the situation and everything else, in relation to your relationship um, and everything. So we can of process that next time, to see maybe if there's certain times that you can start to kind of see maybe a pattern of, of maybe what causes you to feel those, those feelings more than others. Do you feel comfortable in doing something like that? 

00:53:00
ANGELICA Yeah. I think I could. 

00:53:00
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Okay. Well I just want to check in one more time as far as, how do you feel right now as far as if we kind of close out for today. Are you comfortable with coming back in, let's say a week? Does that sound doable? 

00:53:10
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:53:15
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. Well I've really enjoyed our time together and I um, and I'm glad that you felt at least comfortable sharing some of what's happened with me. And we'll move forward from here. Does that sound good. 

00:53:25
ANGELICA Yes. 

00:53:25
TANYA R. HAMMER Okay. In this session with Angelica, from a relational cultural perspective, we started to examine um, how she feels unable to be authentic in the relationship with her boyfriend um, Edward, and started to process um, where exactly that might come from. Um, so what uh, again from an RCT, using RCT language um, started to look at what her relational images might be, causing her to have those expectations in that relationship, which took us to her past, talking about the relationship with her sister Michelle and with her family. And how she had felt in the past as if she didn't matter, as if she didn't have value um, when she was um, herself, and when she was authentic in those relationships, which caused her to experience um, a sense of disconnection, of isolating from others. Um, and how those relational images that she has internalized with her own expectations in relationships, has now transferred into her relationship with Edward. Um, you heard articulated um, that Central Relational Paradox. She wants to be in connection with Edward, but she fears if she's really herself he won't accept her and the relationship won't continue. So she chooses to not be herself and causes um, him to become frustrated with her for not being herself. So those strategies of disconnection and that protection could possibly be what ends up in the relationship not working, if she fails to continue um in, and continues in that path. And so we started to explore um, those relational images, maybe where they came from, and what it would take to kind of reshape those images um, and everything because she expressed in the, in the therapeutic relationship that she does desire to be in relationship with Edward and, and hopes for a future with him. Um, as we would continue in therapy in um, in future session, we would start to look at exactly how she could go about changing those relational images. Um, you can't really do away with them um, because they're there, they're internalized, but you can start to reshape and restructure and reform them um, to where she has different expectations for herself in, in relationships and, and expectations for others. And realize that, that she does matter to Edward. Or if, if she finds out that when she's authentic, and when she's truly herself, that she doesn't have the type of relationship with him that she wants, realizing that she's worth having that authentic relationship, and she does matter enough um, to be herself in relationship and for people to accept her for who she is, and that that should be her expectation um, and everything. So in future, you know, we'll come back and, we would come back and process the journal um, and look at exactly when she felt, and when she struggles most with realizing those expectations. Um, and we would talk about that as far as in future sessions, and go about what we can do to help her move forward in her relationships, and to become more relationally competent, and that would be the ultimate goal in future sessions.
