Virginia Jose Visual Arts Teacher, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:00:40
VIRGINA JOSE We have to work hard to make our group a place where we trust each other. Ensuring that trust allows for other things such as what kind of goal setting ideas we might have as a group, personal goals, academic goals, how can myself as an advisor, what can I do for each advisee to serve as a bridge between family and the academic world which is often based on trust. If you don't know enough about the students, who doesn't know enough about you then it's hard to open up and bridge those two areas. 

00:01:10
Diego 

00:01:10
DIEGO Advisory has helped me be really comfortable in other classes because other times I used to be like really nervous, like I didn't want to speak out or anything and now, like, I feel confident. 

00:01:20

Gathering: Are You More Like Lanier High School, Austin 11th Grade Advisory 

00:01:35
Joseph Kanke English Teacher, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:01:40
JOSEPH KANKE Today we're going to do a gathering called are you more like. So what I will do is I'm going to name two different things and you're going to think for a minute and decide which one you're more like. That doesn't mean which one do you like more. Okay, for example let's do cats and dogs. I am not a big fan of cats but I'm more like a cat. So what do I mean by that? The reason I put myself as a cat is I think they're more individual, like, they don't like to hang around with people as much, like, you can't, how many cats can you tell to sit, right? They make their own decisions. For this activity I'm going to have to ask you to get up out of your seats and if you would stand right on this line. Yes, just those two desks, if you want to put just those two, yeah, and if you would take a place on the line. Before you move I'm going to ask that I get a few characteristics. Are you more like an ocean or a mountain? Yes, this one you have to think way out of the box for this one. Okay so what is some characteristics we can say about oceans? (crosstalk) They move freely, that's very good. What else? 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN It's deep. 

00:03:00
JOSEPH KANKE Very deep. (crosstalk) A lot of activity going on. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN Big. 

00:03:05
JOSEPH KANKE Huge, big, all right now mountains, that was good. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN Mountains are big. 

00:03:10
JOSEPH KANKE Mountains are big as well. (crosstalk) They stand still. (crosstalk) It's colder. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN And it's higher. 

00:03:20
JOSEPH KANKE It's high up. Okay. (crosstalk) A mountain would be more independent. Before you move think for a minute which one you're more like. Okay, oceans, mountains. All right. So if you would just go ahead and turn to a partner, whoever you're standing close by and explain to them why you decided that you were an ocean, or why you decided you were a mountain. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Mountains are more independent, they don't let anybody like, push them around. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN I feel like I'm more like an ocean because I like to go explore things, like, go places to places. That's why I felt I'm like an ocean. 

00:04:10
JOSEPH KANKE Ricky, why did you say you were more like a mountain. 

00:04:15
RICKY 'Cuz I'm more independent. I don't let people tell me what to do or influence me that much. 

00:04:20
JOSEPH KANKE Okay. So Ricky, as you notice, Ricky chose a characteristic about his personality and if you don't mind (inaudible ) what was your choice about a mountain? 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:04:35
JOSEPH KANKE Because you're not tall, right? So, (inaudible ) thought of it from a point of view of physical so when we're thinking about ourselves we have two different types of traits. We have both physical and as well as our personality. Can I ask you guys what did this gathering do for us as a group? 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN Like, you get to know people better. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN You get to know their personalities. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN And their humor.

Gathering: Metaphor Toy Bag Manual High School, Denver 12th Grade Advisory 

00:05:00
Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:05:10
BRANDON HAMLETT So do me a favor guys before you start grabbing at all the objects, can you just let them be for a sec. I'm gonna give you a second to get in everything. Harris can you thank you. All right everybody, how's everybody doing? (crosstalk) Good, good. How is everybody feeling about your future? Shaky, good. (crosstalk) So what we're gonna do for our gathering today (inaudible ) That's an interesting statement. I'll be interested to see what you choose. So what we're gonna do today for our gathering, we're gonna talk about or at least try to use metaphors to talk about our future. There's some objects in front of you, I'm gonna give you guys some time to look at them. What I want you to do is select an object that represents how you're feeling about life after high school and about your future ahead, okay? So there's objects all around, you don't have to pick the ones just in front of you. If you see something you like you can go, like, circle around. I'll give you guys about 90 seconds and then afterwards I'm gonna ask you to describe your object and why you chose it, okay? So does everybody understand what we have to do? Okay, I'll give you about 90 seconds. I really like some of the metaphor activities where they pick an object and or pick a picture, last year we did where they picked a picture and that was supposed to be a metaphor for how they feel there high school career is going and they picked a picture and you know, there's all these kind of weird pictures to choose from then they discuss, I think what was great about that is other students would listen in and they would say, hmm, that kind of is what I'm going through and it's good to hear another peer going through that. Those activities where they hear somebody else mention something that really reflects their own experience, I think that really builds the culture and makes them relate to one another and just learn from each other. Okay, so, everybody has picked an object. Would anybody like to volunteer to go first? And then we'll just go around from there. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Mackenna. 

00:07:10
BRANDON HAMLETT Mackenna offered, oh, okay. We'll start with Mackenna, that's fine. That's all right, we'll get to you. Mackenna, what do you got? 

00:07:15
MACKENNA I picked a magnifying glass and a wheel. 

00:07:20
BRANDON HAMLETT Why? 

00:07:20
MACKENNA I got my futures in my sights so I got to keep it rolling. (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
BRANDON HAMLETT You see you got to be clever, that's a good one. Go ahead, Brie. 

00:07:30
BRIE I picked the compass because I thought it would help me find me way home 'cuz after high school I'll be all, you know, what am I gonna do, I'm not gonna have my dad or anybody there to tell me what to do so I need to find my own way home. 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN All right, I picked the compass similarly like Brianna because, like, I use it to find my way and I picked this one also because I like the message on it, it says yes we can because I know I can do whatever I put my mind to. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Like, I said I customized mine. I had the sugar and a clip so the sugar 'cuz the future's looking sweet but I got to hold it together. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN I chose the candle because it's like, a new stage in my life and like, I turn on the new candle, the old candle was gonna finish soon, the high school and childhood candle so I figure I'll move on, light up a new candle. 

00:08:30
BRANDON HAMLETT Great thoughts everyone. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN I chose, I didn't know what I wanted to choose so I was looking through everything then I decided maybe thread 'cuz I have a long life ahead of me and I just need to sew it all together so I can make a good life and be proud of the life I live. 

00:08:45
BRANDON HAMLETT Very good guys, let's that's a great way to look into your future and I think it's important that we use these moments to not only look at ourselves but kind of look at similarities we have with each other. Like I think some of you are like, oh yeah, that works for me. All right? So good job. 

00:09:00
Lizzy Krueger Science Teacher, Manual HS Denver 

00:09:00
LIZZY KRUEGER Building that community takes awhile. The end goal is to have, in my mind, treat each other like a family and be supportive of one another and help each other and like each other and if they don't like each other at least respect each other. But I've had the experience that through advisory, they really do end up truly caring about one another. 

00:09:20
Elijah 

00:09:25
ELIJAH When we first all started here, none of us knew each other and some of us didn't get along at first but once we started doing all these like, activities and stuff we all got to know each other, we all got to learn more about each other and like, we're basically like, our own little family. 

00:09:40

00:09:40
USBALDO You feel comfortable with them. You can share anything with them, you can talk with them about anything. 

00:09:45
Bobbi 

00:09:45
BOBBI Every day I can know that I'm gonna go to advisory and there's gonna be somebody that's gonna ask me how my day was or like, what's going on in my life that would actually care.

00:11:00
Charlis Smith Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:11:05
CHARLIE SMITH Some of the very first things that I do is just a lot of community building, kind of who am I, why am I here, what do I have to bring to the table so they get lot in right away and there's numerous ways to do that. To all sorts of different ice breaking games, it's a great place to practice team building exercises and things of that nature. 

00:11:25
Jessica 

00:11:25
JESSICA At first our advisory was quiet, we didn't really know each other. My advisor, some of the things she did was we were get up and do activities to get to know each other, to interact with each other, to learn how to communicate, learn all of our names, to work together.

Circle Up 

00:11:50
LIZZY KRUEGER We're gonna start with a gathering and I want you to start thinking about if you were a structure, what would you be? Okay, we're gonna do an activity called straw towers which is really fun, I think and then we're gonna do a closing, we're gonna debrief the straw towers activity. Okay, any questions about today? Okay, so, let's start with the gathering. I'm gonna give you 60 seconds to think about if your a structure or a building, what would you be and I actually want to know why too, okay? I'm gonna give you a couple of examples. First, I really love the ocean so if I was a structure I would be the Golden Gate Bridge because that's in San Francisco by the ocean, right? Another one that I think would work for me. If I was a structure I would be the Sydney Opera House in Australia because that was one of my favorite countries to visit. So does this kind of make sense? Okay, I'm gonna give you 60 seconds to think, ready, go. So you guys had 60 seconds to think, right, and I think we're gonna do this popcorn style so whenever you're ready to speak, feel free to speak but make sure that just one person is talking at a time, okay? 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN If I was a structure I would be the Eiffel Tower because I always wanted to go to Paris, shopping. 

00:13:10
LIZZY KRUEGER I love it. Hey Jess. Let's finish up, there are a couple more left. The question is if you were a structure what would you be, okay? We'll save you for last. 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN If I was a structure I would be the St Charles Recreation Center because that's where I sometimes hang out. 

00:13:35
LIZZY KRUEGER Thank you. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN If I was a structure I'd be the Coliseum because it's been here for a long time and it's popular. 

00:13:45
LIZZY KRUEGER Thank you. I think we have one more. If you were a structure or a building, what would you be? 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN If I were a structure I would be a library because I like to read. 

00:14:00
Grouping Strategy 

00:14:00
LIZZY KRUEGER Good, thank you. All right, today we're gonna do an activity called straw towers. There's only a couple rules, okay? First of all, I grouped you and remember when we do groups we keep happy faces, your groups are your colored puzzle pieces. So whoever has your yellows, blues and the yellows, are going to be group one, okay? Whoever has my blues are going to be group two and whoever has the purples are gonna be group three. Any questions so far? I would like to tell you the rules of this game. First of all, every group gets one hundred straws, okay? You get one roll of masking tape and your brain and that's it. What are the materials? (crosstalk) Good, so everyone gets the same materials. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN You said 100 straws? 

00:15:00
Clear Expectations 

00:15:00
LIZZY KRUEGER 100 straws. Second, your tower has to be free standing which means you cannot tape it to the table or to the ground and the final rule or the final guideline is that whoever builds the tallest freestanding tower is the winner and they're gonna get a prize. Okay, so you have to work together to build the tallest freestanding tower. So we'll say tallest tower is your goal. So group one is gonna go here, group two here, group three here and on your mark, get set, 15 minutes, go. No (inaudible ) 

00:15:49
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:15:50
LIZZY KRUEGER Oh blue is the second table. 

00:15:50
Emanuel 

00:15:50
EMANUEL The games help us also bond 'cuz we also, you know, laugh when we mess up or whatever and yeah, there's never a loser or winner in there, that's the cool thing. 

00:16:00
Check-in 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN We (inaudible ) and then we put a second one like that so it can hold the weight and everything so we can build it up. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Are we building a triangle or are we gonna? 

00:16:20
LIZZY KRUEGER All right, what's the strategy going on here? Wow.

LIZZY KUEGER 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, stop. Hands off please, okay. Everyone please head back to your circle, I will bring your towers over (crosstalk) We're gonna talk just a little bit about something that I saw happen but I am interested in hearing what you think happened so could you think about, for a moment, in your group, what was something that you noticed about yourself and the team you were working with? Don't talk yet, think about it for a moment. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Okay, so, I noticed that the purple group was working together we, everybody had a job, everybody had their own job. 

00:17:20
LIZZY KRUEGER Everyone had a job. What did you notice about yourself, anything? 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN I was actually working. 

00:17:25
LIZZY KRUEGER You were working, okay, I like it, so you were engaged, sounds good. 

00:17:30
Ellen Flanagan Principal, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:17:30
ELLEN FLANAGAN Most importantly, how do you reflect on what you just did. We don't spend enough time reflecting on the things that we do so we're gonna do a session on community building. We also have to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well.

Preview Agenda 

00:18:10
BRANDON HAMLETT Okay, how's everybody doing?(crosstalk) So, today we are going to do an activity called I got your back, okay? And I think it's a great activity, it's gonna help us support each other. Before we begin we're gonna look within and then we'll see, you know, how to, some things we see in each other. So you guys, write your name like this but don't put it at the very top because we're gonna put tape up here so just write your name a little bit lower. The first thing that we're gonna do, we already put our name on the cardstock. Next we're gonna recognize a quality or asset that we have with ourselves, okay? And you don't need to write that down I just want you to kind of think about it, all right? Next we're gonna get you moving around with a nice I got your back activity. Now I'll explain what it is later but right now I just want you to know we're gonna really recognize our peers and support them. Like I said, first we're gonna look within, okay? And then finally we'll just see what we got out of this activity, okay? So, I am passing out an assets and quality of character sheet. I have them put the tables in a square or it's like a rectangle. They know that we're, gonna do some type of lesson working together. I think another thing that I learned as, it's kind of a classroom management technique, just there's a lot of little pockets of talking in advisory and that's, you know, that's okay until we get to the lesson, waiting until everybody's listening and again, it just kind of creates like, a group atmosphere where like, where, when somebody speaks we're really trying to listen to what they're saying. Can we have a volunteer who would like to start and then we'll just go around in a circle from there. 

00:19:45
Go-Round 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN All right, well my word that I chose was idealistic 'cuz whenever I want to do something I always want to be the best at it. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN My word is caring because I care about myself and the people around me. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN I feel that I'm curious because I feel that like, I need to know what life has in store for me. 

00:20:00
BRANDON HAMLETT The reason we're doing this guys is we've been together for almost two years now and, cheering, and it's right now more than anytime it's really important that you start identifying what assets and strengths of character you can use in the future beyond high school, how you can make them work for you so today we're going to take this opportunity to support our peers and help them maybe recognize some assets either they may have thought about or have not thought about, okay? So what we're gonna do Mariah can you stand up and come here and bring your card too. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:20:40
BRANDON HAMLETT So here's what you're gonna do so Mariah, turn around everybody's (crosstalk) so I will take the cardstock on the back of Loretta, okay? And then, here turn so everybody can see, you don't get to see, and then I am going, I picked a asset that I think is good for Mariah. And then I'm just gonna put a quick explanation of what I mean. 

00:21:15
MARIAH Advisory, I feel it's helped us in many ways like, it helps me academically and sometimes emotionally. Advisors act like they care about us. 

00:21:20
Materials Prepared 

00:21:25
BRANDON HAMLETT Now here is the deal guys. I don't tell her what this says. She'll find out at the end. We're gonna go around and you're gonna try to get as, almost if you can, maybe every student in this room, okay? Just as long as time provides we'll try to get to every single student. Okay, I have tape ready to go over here, all right? So you tape it on his back, you do the asset and then you guys switch and go the other way. Everybody cool? All right. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:00
BRANDON HAMLETT You ready? You want to, I'll do you first. 

00:22:05

00:22:05
Interactive 

00:22:10
BRANDON HAMLETT A lot of it I started with was just building the relationship with them and telling them that our relationship was gonna grow as they grew as adults.

00:22:30

00:22:35

00:22:35
Group Encouragement 

00:22:40
BRANDON HAMLETT Guys, as you're wrapping up if you can come back to the table and help everybody pull off their asset sheet from their back and give it to them. I like, see I like what Sarah's doing, I like what Paul's doing. You know just some self reflection, look within. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:10
BRANDON HAMLETT All right, quick I have a question for you guys first I want to start, any thoughts about this activity? (crosstalk) Why'd you like it Grace? 

00:23:10
Debrief and Reflection 

00:23:15
GRACE Because you get to see what people think about you that they normally don't tell you. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN It was good about too, they were writing it on your back and they're not embarrassed just telling you because they're not looking at you. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
BRANDON HAMLETT How can an activity like this help us with just our, just working together as peers? How do you guys think that this helps? (crosstalk) Self realization, what do you mean? 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Self realization like, when you read these, you know like, more about yourself because that's how other people see you through their eyes. 

00:23:55
BRANDON HAMLETT Did you see some things on there that you're like, oh I didn't think about that or did you just say, oh that kind of strengthens what I thought. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, kind of like strengthening it more. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Can I ask a question? 

00:24:10
BRANDON HAMLETT Yeah. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Was anybody surprised at what they got? At what they read? 

00:24:15
BRANDON HAMLETT I was surprised. I got some, I was surprised. How were you surprised McKenna? 

00:24:20
MCKENNA I was surprised 'cuz it didn't seem like people really noticed that much about other people, to me it is. 

00:24:25
BRANDON HAMLETT So maybe we're more observant than we let on sometimes? 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN It makes me happy, well it made me happy that other people think about you when you talk to them or something but knowing that they really notice what you're doing and what you're there for. 

00:24:40
BRANDON HAMLETT It put a big smile on my face, absolutely. Okay guys, so just last lap for this, you're transitioning to life beyond high school after this and these qualities and more of these on these lists, these are some things you need to really think about and draw on. 

00:24:50
Lizzy Krueger Science Teacher, Manual HS, Devner 

00:24:55
LIZZY KRUEGER Teaching my students to support one another in advisory helps them in their other classes and so teaching them what good support looks like, teaching them how to celebrate someone else, you know, instead of saying something derogatory, you want to make sure that those accomplishments that might seem nerdy or silly are celebrated. 

00:25:10
Ellen Flanagan Principal, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:25:10
ELLEN FLANAGAN How do you build relationships with other people? You know, how do you build relationships with coworkers, how do you build relationships in study groups, when you go to college, these are learned skills and lots of times we don't emphasize those skills that are as important as the academic learning. 

00:25:30
Sir 

00:25:30
SIR I do team building. You can build relationships and any friendship begins with just somebody, somebody you don't know so as an advisory we didn't start off as friends, well a couple of us did, you know, little steps into the group but as time passed you kind of got to know each other more and built that friendship.

Rituals and Routines 

00:26:15
Lizzy Krueger Science Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:26:50
LIZZY KRUEGER To create a space where they feel safe, I make sure to always meet them at the door so we do a meet and greet. I like high fives, I know some teachers like handshakes and sometimes we've gotten into the routine where instead of a high five if they're having a bad day they'll give me a high one, like this, and I'll know that they're not feeling it that day but that even, meeting them at the door can give me a sense of how they're doing and also makes them feel like I was waiting for them and that I'm welcoming them and that I really want them to be there that day. 

00:27:20
Marne Gulley English Teacher, Manual HS Denver 

00:27:20
MARNE GULLEY But as soon as that safe environment's there I think they look forward to that non academic, kind of check in and knowing that it's like, genuine and real and it's not just, we have to go around and say how we feel today, but that like, someone remembers that yesterday was a bad day for you and asks how things are going today.

00:28:10
MARNE GULLEY We circle up at the beginning of every advisory and it's not, I'm tired and lazy today, but like, we do that and it's very purposeful and I've always found it within a couple days like, it's so like, clockwork and kids are doing it and getting chairs for each other and I think that just makes it feel different than other classes and that always facilitates the get togetherness in many of the purposes of advisory.

ELLEN FLANAGAN So we always have an opening and over the course of the last few years we have identified what our opening is so we always come together and we talk about what's the best part of our week and what's the thing that's not the best part of our week. So in doing so we are really translating what their week looks like. So you know we're gonna start with, what's the best part of our week and what's the thing about our week that we don't necessarily like so far. So who wants to start?

00:34:35
ELLEN FLANAGAN We always end with a closing so our closing is there's a closing to the session guide but we also, as an advisory group, which I think a lot of advisory groups do, you have a ritual that you've created so ours is, what's the one word that you're going to, you're feeling at this very moment. Okay, does everyone have their word, how they're feeling? Kind of a tough day, kind of had a great day for some of us, we got report cards, we got some winning teams, we've got some losing teams, what's your one word on how you're feeling and we'll do a quick go around. Who wants to start? Oh, Bianca, thank you.

00:36:10
ELLEN FLANAGAN If you keep those habits and those structures in place, kids are gonna feed into it. Kids are gonna be able to, to the degree in which I have been at a meeting and my advisory has run itself. There has been simply a facilitator because the structure in of itself has been something that's allowed them to feel a comfort level and a confidence that they don't need the principal or their advisor to lead that session. They have a confidence and they have a knowledge in which a session should operate like this.
