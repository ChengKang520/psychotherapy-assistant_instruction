ZOY KAZAN So I would like to introduce myself. I'm Zoy Kazan and I'm meeting today with a group of experienced narrative therapists and umm… and not so experienced narrative therapists who are… who are teach… starting to teach the beginning ideas. And, umm… we're interested in answering some frequently asked questions about Narrative Therapy. And I've been in this field for nearly 20 years and trained at the Dulwich Centre and now work as a therapist and supervisor in Ukiah in Northern California. And this is Kathie. 

00:01:05
KATHIE CROCKET I'm Kathie Crocket. I'm a visitor to California, having arrived just a few days ago from Hamilton, New Zealand, where I teach in a university program that for a number of years has focused on teaching sessions, constructionist ideas and Narrative Therapy. And for many years, I did that with my colleague John. 

00:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE That's right, Kathie. I'm John Winslade and I'm, as Kathie said a colleague of hers at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, and have been for a number of years, since about 1993, I guess it was. And now I've… I'm actually living in California and teaching at California State University at San Bernardino. 

00:01:45
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT I'm Ruthie Barrett, and I'm a doctorial student at Loma Linda University with my colleague. 

00:01:50
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL I'm Sarah Stuchell. I'm also a doctoral level student. And Ruthie and I have begun teaching some narrative classes, umm… as you mentioned. And we have some kind of… some questions that students ask us. So, they frequently ask questions that we wanted to share with you guys and get their feedback. 

00:02:10
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yeah. And some of the basic questions that it will be very interesting to… to get slightly different answers, and we'll also just see what Narrative Therapy is all about from the experts. 

00:02:25
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL So the first question is "How do you explain Narrative Therapy to clients when they ask you what you do, or what kind of therapy/modality you work from? 

00:02:40
ZOY KAZAN Well, that's a really difficult question. And I think every time I explain Narrative Therapy, it's really different from the last time. And, I often say something like, "When people come to therapy, they often come with a story about themselves that's not their preferred story." And in the process of therapy, we work together to, umm… co-create a another story that really involves looking at other parts of their lives that up until this time have been unexamined. So, that might be the… the 30-second version. What would you say, John? 

00:03:20
JOHN WINSLADE What I was thinking was that there are many stories that shape and create our lives. And some of them, we have some say in and others are given to us. And umm… I think helping people sort out and make choices about, you know, which stories they want to live from umm… and which stories they want to have… create distance from themselves from to dysidentify with, if you like. It'd be I guess what I would have as a purpose in working with people in a narrative way. What do you think, Kathie? What you got another way of approaching that? 

00:04:00
KATHIE CROCKET Yeah. When I was thinking that often in New Zealand as well people don't know what therapy is… 

00:04:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:04:10
KATHIE CROCKET And so they come with some expectation of someone who, kind of, have already an existent answers. 

00:04:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:04:15
KATHIE CROCKET And so I would emphasize that to give, you know… I'll be really interested in asking them questions that are about their lives as they live them, because I… you know, it's something we can only do to give our, the… 

00:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So, you put out front your role of asking questions rather than… some other kind of role… 

00:04:35
KATHIE CROCKET Yeah, yeah. 

00:04:35
JOHN WINSLADE If you like, I mean rather than telling or something? 

00:04:40
KATHIE CROCKET Yeah. I think that's an important phase of the unformed consent process that people understand that they are there to, in a sense, engage and telling these, you know, the stories that make up their lives. And that they are agreeing to… to participate in that kind of a therapy process. 

00:05:00
JOHN WINSLADE What I'm just thinking… I'm wondering what… how you've experienced this in California, Zoy. And… There's a strong story about therapy around, that it's a place you go to express your feelings. 

00:05:15
ZOY KAZAN Oh, yes, yes. 

00:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Have you kind of enga… had people… had that kind of story and kind of brought to you your… the work that you do with people? 

00:05:25
ZOY KAZAN Yes, yes. Actually, I was just reflecting while Kathie was talking about how different it is in New Zealand and in Australia, that people really don't know about therapy, so they almost come in with no idea about what to expect. Whereas here in California, there's been such a strong tradition of psychodynamic or Freudian-based ideas that people really come expecting to express their feelings. And when… when as a narrative… Narrative therapist I'm working with them and I'm not asking how they feel about something. They feel quite, umm… discombobulated about that. And will often say things like, "Well, aren't you gonna ask me how I'm feeling? And aren't you interesting in… Are you not interested in how I'm feeling?" As if I have somehow disobeyed their basic rule about therapy. 

00:06:15
JOHN WINSLADE I mean, a lot of people have that as a question about narrative approach to therapy, isn't it? You know, like… 

00:06:20
ZOY KAZAN That's true. 

00:06:20
JOHN WINSLADE Is this… Is this an approach that's not… "I mean, don't you care about how I feel?" 

00:06:25
ZOY KAZAN Right. Right. 

00:06:25
JOHN WINSLADE Or, how… how your clients feel or something like that. 

00:06:30
ZOY KAZAN Yes. Yes. 

00:06:30
KATHIE CROCKET And that's not, you know, I mean… I guess I want to say that's… it's not to say that feelings aren't present, but we come at them at different… in different ways. 

00:06:40
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:06:40
KATHIE CROCKET I mean, I think of the joy and the pain and, you know, the whole range of lived experience that I've shared with clients. But that has come at… Like it's… there's… there isn't a privileging of feelings as they may be in other therapies, but that doesn't mean feeling is absent or that it's named in the way that other therapies might name that. 

00:07:05
ZOY KAZAN Right. I remember thinking, before I trained in narrative ideas that there had to be at least two boxes of tissues in any therapist's room. 

00:07:10
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hmm. 

00:07:15
ZOY KAZAN And there was this idea that the more tears your cried in a therapy session the better. And now it's like… It's not that people don't cry in sessions, because they do. But it's not the purpose of the session. 

00:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, is it different… I mean, I think of it is a different mechanism, a different sort of idea of how change happens. It's more about… 

00:07:30
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:07:30
JOHN WINSLADE …not about getting people to express their feelings in order that they move somewhere, so much as, umm… that the feelings that we feel are situated in the stories that we tell and they are kind of part and parcel of them, they need to be acknowledged, they are part of the pain and the joy and… and so on, that you were talking about, Kathie. But we are not kind of thinking that that's… that the expression of those things is what leads to shifts and changes. 

00:08:00
KATHIE CROCKET And I have noticed that we are already talking about, you know, sort of, an insight to therapy when we were talking about what we would tell people… 

00:08:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:08:10
KATHIE CROCKET Because we have talked about the different things we might tell people in different context. And for me, that says something about Narrative Therapy as well that you said, Zoy, that you will say something different to everybody. And that… that we… There is always that… And certainly the arenas of the context of, you know, who am I in relation with this person and who are they in the context. So, I'm not quite sure what I'd say about… I don't think it's something I would necessarily say to clients, that it will be something sitting in the back of my head always of what is… as I begin, you know what is there about context. It's particularly important and what I might say or… and what this person might be wondering. 

00:08:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, you know, when you say context, what are you thinking off? Sorry. 

00:09:00
KATHIE CROCKET Oh, that was a big question. 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE Well, I'm just wondering, are you meaning the room and the circumstances of the therapy? Are you thinking of more than that? 

00:09:10
KATHIE CROCKET Well, I think we are talking about cultural differences between, you know, between California and New Zealand… 

00:09:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Okay. 

00:09:15
KATHIE CROCKET Talking about the sitting, talking about, you know, are we this… Do we came from the same general cultural background, age, you know, gender, socioeconomic, you know, all the kinds of umm… 

00:09:30
JOHN WINSLADE All the things that divide people into the different ways, in different ways, you mean? 

00:09:35
KATHIE CROCKET Well, no. I wasn't thinking just in… in division. 

00:09:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:09:40
KATHIE CROCKET But I suppose I am speaking about differences. But, like, there isn't an assumption that I will know all that. Because you and I come from New Zealand, that we will see things that, you know, that we will have common understandings. So… So there will be an interest in the other… of the other person as well as in the meeting between us. You know that… that, like, what is it that I need to learn from you in order to do this work? 

00:10:10
ZOY KAZAN Yes. It's almost as if as the therapist, I'm acting as if I'm an outsider to this person's life and not making assumptions that I'm… that I know what their experience is or what they mean by something. And that… that sometimes, the closer in culture or age or experience they are to me, the more I want to situate myself outside their experience because I… Sometimes, the assumption that you understand can be something that closes the space in terms of developing a conversation… a conversation that's really useful to people. 

00:10:50
JOHN WINSLADE I mean, what's coming to my mind as you talk about differences and… and those assumptions that you work with is the… the strong pull in many psychologies towards trying to articulate a universal human nature which would give us the basis for saying that we know, that we can understand, that we can appreciate what someone else is. And, I mean, for me that's I think an important principle about… of a narrative approach, that it's actually… well, certainly downplaying that possibility that there is something's, kind of, universal human nature. And that theories can be built about it that are somehow free of the contexts and the cultural influences and the… the dividing practices of the world and so on. 

00:11:45
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT So I was wondering, with your clients, do you wait to be asked questions or do you have things that you like to say at the beginning that sort of make it clear how to work with them when you're doing Narrative Therapy? 

00:11:55
KATHIE CROCKET I think… I mean, I… I think of my teaching, you know, our students use disclosure process as info. And I'm not doing any therapy myself at the moment. I'm doing supervision and I use a disclosure for, you know, a written disclosure for supervision. So I think, you know, that… that it's really important that we make information available in as many ways as possible. And that's… that's essentially one of the things that Narrative Therapy offered me, was a much closure scrutiny of how I begin and so I do… I think that informed consent process has become increasingly important. And I think that goes beyond narrative practice for me but, you know, and… and part of that beginning is saying, you some, you know, ask me questions as we go along if you want to do that and… 

00:12:45
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT I'm wondering also how you… how you talk about diagnoses? Do you do that together? Do you do that openly or do you handle that differently? Maybe that's a little different question, but something I think people really like to know, is how to work within our DSN for our diagnosis with Narrative Therapy? 

00:13:05
ZOY KAZAN Well, the context of my work has being that… I only have a few clients now because I'm supervising. But the clients that I have all came to me in fairly extreme crisis. In fact, three of them were hospitalized as a result of the first contact. And so explaining the therapy didn't take place till after they had come out of the hospital and we… that we were then talking about what put them in the hospital. And… And so the discussion about what therapy was and is and how I worked evolved over a period of weeks as they became more interested in what I was providing for them and less caught up in survival issues, I think. I think that has to be said. 

00:13:55
JOHN WINSLADE So people… Do these people come, as Ruthie was asking, with diagnoses already? 

00:14:00
ZOY KAZAN They don't. When they first come to see me, they just come in crisis. 

00:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:14:05
ZOY KAZAN It's usually a suicide attempt. And so, umm… sometimes my first interview is actually in the hospital with them drinking charcoal or, you know, some medical response to what they have done. And… And really, I'm just trying to get them to a place where they can feel safe for a few days, and that's usually a hospital. And, so it takes a while before we're really in a position to talk about therapy per say, because I'm really just starting a process with them. But, you know, at least three of the children I worked with have been out of the hospital for a long time. And we've had lots of conversations about therapy and situating the problem outside of them. And… And, I'm very transparent about that with each stage. But because they are teenagers, I don't give them an overview of Narrative Therapy to start with. But they could probably give you an overview of what I do by now. Is that they are fast learners and they sort of know this is the questions that I'm likely to ask them. 

00:15:15
KATHIE CROCKET I guess having listened to your answer following mine, I'm thinking this would be one of the really important things I'd want to say about, you know, that often people say, "Well, what's the Narrative Therapy response to x(ph)?" And there isn't a singular response at anytime, you know, (inaudible ). Once again, it's contextual. And umm… some of those things are in the particular work context that I was, maybe, in personal preferences that each of us has. And the kinds of places we position ourselves. 

00:15:45
ZOY KAZAN Yes. And also the willingness of the person to be engaged in therapy because, you know, a young child… a young woman who tries to commit suicide, may not necessarily want to engage in therapy. And a lot of the process of the conversations might be about, "Well, I'm coming here because I'm forced to, or because my parents are making me or because the doctor said I had to come to therapy." And… And so, really, you don't have that contract with them that you are… you are speaking about. They are… They aren't… They aren't willing for quite a long time. 

00:16:20
KATHIE CROCKET Yes, yes. 

00:16:25
ZOY KAZAN And… And so sometimes the conversations are just about what it's like to be in a place where you don't want to be, and just, you know, talking about that. And… And how… how come you got to be in that place. And, you know, the evolving, sort of, story of how they get to be their own person instead of being pushed around by someone else. And sometimes, I put words to that story. But, it is usually something that… that young people really start to resonate with, that being their own person is much more preferable to being their parent's person or being my person or being the doctor's person. But it is an evolving conversation. 

00:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE What I noticed as you were talking then was the… you know, the word therapy itself starts to shift and change and become a moving thing. And you were talking about various conversations, umm… and you know, like, I mean, people have different ideas about what therapy is. I mean, you know, for some people it's a cure or it's… some kind of search for deep insight. But, what I heard you talking about was something quite different, right. I mean… 

00:17:40
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:17:40
JOHN WINSLADE …it's more about conversations in which people kind of, making decisions and choices about their lives, or something like that. How would you describe it? I mean… 

00:17:50
ZOY KAZAN Right, right. And… And some of my conversations, sometimes I think, "Well, I'm not really doing Narrative Therapy here." It's almost like I'm… 

00:17:55
JOHN WINSLADE Whatever that means. 

00:17:55
ZOY KAZAN Whatever that means. 

00:17:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:18:00
ZOY KAZAN But it's almost like I'm having these… What does that mean? 

00:18:00
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL Yeah. Is there one way? 

00:18:05
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:18:05
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL Is there a right way? 

00:18:05
ZOY KAZAN Yes. But what I was about to say was I'm almost having a preliminary conversation. This negotiating about power and about who gets to say whether this child sits in a room with me and has a conversation for 50 minutes a week. And… And whether the child will have the conversation with me or not and on what terms? And… And just making that transparent is sometimes all I can do. You know, getting them to say, "I don't want to be here. I don't choose this." And some… some kids, that's really a breakthrough to be able to just stand up and say something like that instead of throwing the chairs or… you know, no one is throwing chairs, but they have certainly tried to run away. 

00:18:50
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT What, to you, is Narrative Therapy? What is it? When people ask us that and… 

00:18:55
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL And then what would be the goal of Narrative Therapy? 

00:19:00
ZOY KAZAN Okay. 

00:19:05
KATHIE CROCKET You know the "What is Narrative Therapy" question… I was thinking as you were speaking, Zoy, you know, it's like there's a way in which you are positioning yourself in each of those conversations. You know, I mean, I was… through my lens, I find too for what you're saying, that you are positioning yourself right from your first encounter with them. You don't become a narrative therapist somewhere down the track once they know what therapy is, and you have agreed. You're actually in that your awareness of power, you're listening to what's been happening for them, what their ideas about being there. You know, what… Do you want to say something that rather than, kind of, me doing an interpretation of what I was… 

00:19:45
ZOY KAZAN Well, yeah. I think it… it changes in every context. I think you are right about that. And in some ways, I'm a witness to the dilemma that this… this young person's in. And I'm… I'm witnessing and I am reflecting that, what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing and… and inviting them to reflect with me about that. And, at… at that point in time, that's Narrative Therapy for me with that particular person. But with an adult who comes in with pre… you know, with other ideas about therapy, that… that session, that first session would be very, very different. I don't have many people who come in with preconceived ideas about therapy anymore. So… So Narrative Therapy is like a shifting target. I mean, it's really… it's changing in every context with every person. It changes every year. I have been doing it for a long time and every year it looks different, I'm sure. 

00:20:50
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT So essentially, what's the essence of it? Is it a stance? Is it a way of viewing problems, way of viewing change? 

00:20:55
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL Is there a set of assumptions that guide your view points? 

00:21:00
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Or certain roles… 

00:21:00
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL The way you work with people? 

00:21:00
ZOY KAZAN I think there are a set of assumptions. And… And I must say they change… they have changed overtime. I think there is a particular stance that you have as you engage with people that is really inviting them to be experts on their lives. And you are inviting them to share experiences with you that they may never have shared before, because there are particular ways of asking questions that invite them to view their history, maybe in a slightly different light and to make choices about how they see themselves from that light. Does that make sense? 

00:21:45
JOHN WINSLADE I mean that's helpful, because I have been sitting here with a hesitation about answering that question. You know, what is Narrative Therapy? Or what is the essence of it or something like that. And the hesitation is about… Well, you know, how can I just make any pronouncement on that that would make any sense? Umm… And what would be the politics of doing that? Because as I understand it, I mean, what a narrative practice is about is the result of many conversations by many people who shared some… and some certain assumptions and talked about these… those assumptions. And… And some of those conversations took place… take place still in writing. And, you know, and partly it's an approach to language and the relationship between language and meaning and stories in people's lives, and the politics of all of that. So, umm… you know, it's… in some sense, it's an effort to think differently than the way in which that those kind of questions can usually be asked and answered about therapies. Which may sound like a bit of a dodge, but it's… I don't think it is. How is that sounding to you, I mean? 

00:23:00
ZOY KAZAN I think… I think what your answer does for me is open up possibilities that stand outside of narrative being one particular essence or an essentialist belief system. 

00:23:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Yeah, I mean for me it's significant that Michael White and David Epston didn't name it Narrative Therapy. 

00:23:15
ZOY KAZAN No, they didn't. 

00:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. That was a name that… that evolved, that became attached to it as a result of a certain questions, and eventually we kind of embraced. But that doesn't mean there aren't shared patterns of thinking and behavior and… and practice and so on that people who participate in this conversation about narrative practices don't, you know, share assumptions about or share practices, you know, that they don't share. 

00:23:45
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT What are some of those assumptions that come to mind? 

00:23:45
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL That guide your work? 

00:23:50
JOHN WINSLADE Assumptions. Well, we were talking before… You asked the question before about diagnoses for example. And… And for me, one of the assumptions, an important assumption of those who work in a narrative way is that… most people that I've met anyway, would be that, you know, any kind of diagnosis is simple a story about someone that has got a certain kind of… usually got a certain kind of authority attached to it. Now that's not… that's a different way of thinking about diagnoses than is the usual way which is that it's somehow some truth about the nature of a person. And that's not to say that… that's not to claim that the diagnosis and what it says is untrue, to say that it's a story. But it's simply a story from a perspective in a context, in a… you know… you know, political arrangement of relationships. And a narrative approach would be to hear it that way. And then to be interested in, you know, what that does for the person to whom it's applied. What affect it has for them? And whether those affects are useful or not useful for them? And whether they have any other stories that are available to them about who they are and what they think of their own lives and what their hopes and dreams are for their own lives? Umm… So, in a sense that's a… a deconstructive assumption that… you know, the language which we even talk about therapy or diagnoses or people's lives needs to come… become part of the therapy itself. And so a deconstructive approach, kind of, opens all that out for… for a new kind of attention, and… and attention in terms of how it fits in the relations that… that someone is living in, the sort of relations between the people in the context of their lives, the immediate context and the therapeutic context, for that matter. That's just one assumption that I… that comes to my mind. I don't know whether… 

00:26:10
ZOY KAZAN Yes… yes. And… And I work… working in California, I… I must say, has really forced me to look at diagnosis and take it more seriously than I had to when I worked in Australia as a therapist. And part of that is really due in fact to working in agencies that are funded through the medical(ph) system where they actually… you can't treat a child unless you can prove that there's something called "medical necessity." You would know all about this. And because I find DSM for a language really off putting when I'm working with teenagers, I tend not to talk very much about the diagnosis with them. I tend to have this piece of paper that I say, "Well, we need to write a diagnosis on this piece of paper in order for us to finance this session. And this is the… this is the diagnosis I'm putting there. But I'm much more interested in your experience of that. And I'm really interested in you getting what you want out of these sessions." So, I tend to let them know that there's a diagnosis and there's something being written. But also let them know that that will change overtime and that it's my hope that by the time they have finished the sessions with me and I come to write the discharge summary, that I will able to write that there's no diagnosis on, you know, on any of these categories. I had a kid who has… would have been said to have an eating disorder, and to actually talk with her about… We actually named it Bulimia. But, you know, what does Bulimia invite you to do, so that she could actually see it as outside of herself. And… And she actually was successful in defeating Bulimia, in a… you know, in a… I think it was within eight weeks she had stopped vomiting. 

00:28:10
JOHN WINSLADE Wow! 

00:28:15
ZOY KAZAN You know, because… And I think there were various ways in which we did that. We sidestepped the diagnosis or her identifying with that. And, you know, one of the ways I did it was to actually look at the website from New Zealand, from David Epston's work, and to really get her to read some of the letters of other young people who have struggled against Bulimia. And we did that in a session and then she went home and did it as well. And I asked her what she had read and what difference it made. And very shortly after that she stopped the practice of purging. And I… I think that was really significant in terms of buying into a diagnosis, but then distancing from it, externalizing it, and then inviting her to read the letters of other young people who had also stood up to it. 

00:29:05
JOHN WINSLADE I mean, I think Narrative Therapy is based in a poststructuralist account of power, which is very different from some of the other accounts of power that are around. It's not a structural base… not on a basis of simple structural positioning, you know, like where you are powerful because you are in a certain kind of position, a structure, or because you are middleclass or male or white or anything like that. It's more of an idea. The power is created out of… in relations between people, in constantly shifting relations between people. And that has a… And that knowledge is actually part of that, both the creation of the power that shapes those relations, and is also impacted by the relations. I don't know, I'm kind of… rambling. Do you want to… 

00:30:00
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yeah, I have a question… 

00:30:00
JOHN WINSLADE You have a question. 

00:30:00
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT I have a question to that. I'm wondering, do you feel like a narrative therapist or someone working narratively, umm… needs a certain sort of faith in the process? Or is there some sense of where you're going, or is there more sense that you'll… you'll be going somewhere important if you go through this collaborative process? Does that make sense as a question? 

00:30:25
KATHIE CROCKET Well, if I can pick up an answer to that… You know, one of the things we were talking earlier was, you know, what attracted you to this way of working? And I remember watching David Epston showing videos of his work, and he had stopped the video and say, watch… this was, you know, before I'd learned these ideas. "Watch this next move." You know the idea that he was able to so closely show how this way of working had affects that were therapeutic, was one of the things that attracted me to it. So, you say, do you have a… a faith in it. And I guess… I… I think that if… if identity is… is a social production, that paying attention to how we speak with each other is incredibly important. And so, I… I guess since… since that initial workshop with David and when I starting reading and going to workshops and learning a whole lot more of seeing… seeing the effects of that, not distant therapy, but in everyday life. Now I've got myself lost too, this is a… 

00:31:40
ZOY KAZAN But this is a really interesting point about the faith of the therapist, because in the years that I trained with Michael White, and they were quite a few years where I sat behind the one-way mirror and was part of teams with… at Dulwich Centre. What I noticed was that no matter how difficult the problem, he always had a knack of asking the person a question that would almost reach… enable them to reach into their past or into their experience, and draw forth something that was part of their identity that by the end of the session, they… they would seem to have turned a corner. Even if the problem still seemed insurmountable, they seemed to be standing a little bit stronger, or seemed to have a… 

00:32:30
JOHN WINSLADE So the faith is that those possibilities will always be there. 

00:32:35
ZOY KAZAN That the… That the possibilities will be there. 

00:32:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:32:35
ZOY KAZAN No matter how daunting the problem is. And I watched him year after year after year doing this work. And I think it's the thing that I really took with me that… that in order to do this work, you have to have some faith, really, that in the person's history, in the stories that have maybe not been told about them. There… There will be qualities and ideals and values and… and beliefs about them and about the world that will solve this problem. But in the moment, you may be overwhelmed by the problem as a therapist. And sometimes, it's really good to just say, "Oh, I think the problem has really taken over. That right now I'm… I'm… I'm really under the influence and I… I can really feel the heaviness that the problem has brought into your life." And… And you know, sometimes just acknowledging that will just free up a little bit more space. Because you'll think, "Oh, well, then how am I gonna overcome this heaviness?" And if the therapist can say, "Oh, okay, well, how am I gonna do this?" They can then generate questions about how this other person's gonna do it as well. 

00:33:50
JOHN WINSLADE Just thinking of another way to describe that. It's a faith in the complexity or the indeterminacy of life. 

00:33:55
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:33:55
JOHN WINSLADE That there is, you know, rather than a faith in the singularity or the wholeness or the… 

00:34:00
KATHIE CROCKET Inevitability. 

00:34:05
JOHN WINSLADE Inevitability of life, right? 

00:34:05
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:34:05
JOHN WINSLADE That the… the complexity, the indeterminacy suggests that there will always be exceptions, or always be gaps, or always be something that doesn't fit with whatever people are experiencing as problematic. And I think, you know, holding that as an assumption, as a statement of faith, if you like, as a statement of profession. I think of professionals as being, people who professed something and I think that's a good thing to profess. You know, enables, umm… the bringing forward of those things and the growing of them into stories that can become viable and sustaining for people. 

00:34:45
RUTH HOUSTON BARNETT There's commonly a question is raised by people who are just learning about social construction study as Narrative Therapy, umm… about morality. Is everything rele… relative? In a special way… 

00:35:00
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL That there is no right and wrong, anything goes. 

00:35:00
RUTH HOUSTON BARNETT Yes. 

00:35:00
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL It's all socially constructed. 

00:35:00
RUTH HOUSTON BARNETT Socially constructed and therefore somehow some people take that as meaning that it's not important or it's not real, or something like that. And, umm… is there anything that you guys might want to add to that conversation? 

00:35:20
ZOY KAZAN I think inviting people to talk about their values and for the therapist to even acknowledge his or her values is a really important piece of the work that I'm engaged in. And being really interested in where those values come from and what's appealing about them, and what happens when the person lives by them or what happens when they don't, and what their preferences are. I think… I think there are whole lot conversations and dialogues about values that… They are just really powerful conversations. And so, it's not a matter of anything goes. It's a matter of, well, what works for you and what works in your family and how you are different from your family and… It's… For me, it's been very creative to have those conversations about my own life, and to really examine those things. So, far from being anything goes, it's actually taught me to be more discerning about what I actually want in my life, and how I live my life, and what I value about relationships and… and having conversations in my everyday life. And… And looking at the practice… social practices, the discourses that happen in everyday life, and… and the way people treat each other and the way I treat people and, really looking at how my values create those conversations or… or don't create them or challenge or interrupt those conversations if I feel like it's contrary to what… what I want to live my life for or about. I mean that's… that's a personal answer to it. I… I guess personal answers are really important to me, because really the personal for me is the political. And in Narrative Therapy, that's very true, that we can have a very, sort of, low key conversation about something like values, but it will have monumental effects on a person and how they live their life. I mean, we don't know that, but people come back, you know, years later and say, "Oh, you know, would you have thought that I'd be where I am 10 years ago when you first saw me?" And… And I might say, "Well, actually I'm not surprised that you are where you're at," if the person's really… Because I… I can see that that developed on where the values you had back then. It's not that I'm advising them to go in any direction at all, but I'm really inviting them to say what their preferences are, and that then opens the space for their life to go in a certain direction. And people… Because I go back to Australia infrequently, I… I meet up with people who had conversations with me 10 or 15 years ago, who've made incredible changes in their lives. And it's… I don't take any credit for it, but I do think those values, conversations lay the groundwork for people to develop in certain ways. 

00:38:25
JOHN WINSLADE And in my mind, a narrative approach is as much about an ethical practice as anything else. It's not so much just a set of techniques as it is an effort to put into practice the ethics of what you believe and the assumptions that line it now. I can't… I can't see how that sounds like anything goes. So, it always puzzles me when people say that. You know. 

00:38:50
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL Puzzles us too. 

00:38:50
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yeah. 

00:38:55
KATHIE CROCKET And then since, you know, like, if… If Narrative Therapy is a therapy about storying, you know, storying with people their lives it's… it's also for us a matter of us storying our practice. And in the same way as lives are individually storied, calling on the kind of cultural stories that are available, you know, whether those are gendered stories or, you know, family history stories. And so similarly, for each of us as therapists, there is a story of our practice and there will be stories in common. But, I mean, there have been lots of people sitting with me here as we've been talking, other… other people I've spoken in conversation with, the writers I have read, you know and… and so we are called in that sense to given an account of our practice. And, you know, as John saying, the ethical… the ethical terms of their account are really important. I mean, I was thinking, when you first asked the question about some of the research our students have done. And always in chapter one there's an account of their positioning. And I think what this calls us to is to locate our positions and give an account of those positions. 

00:40:10
JOHN WINSLADE I… I want to add too that the… that some of the… the philosophical background writing that narrative has drawn upon, you have got people who are called postmodern and are critiqued on the basis of their so called "relativism". But I… I can point you to places where someone like Michel Foucault would say something like never get up… give up the search for truth. Never give it up. And I can point to people like, you know, Derrida who is… is criticized for his deconstructive work for… and people saying that he makes every meaning relative and, you know, the truth disappears. And… And Derrida would say, umm… that there are many things… there are a number of things that simply can't be deconstructed, you know. So, I think it's… this idea that there is this kind of relativism is umm… a fallacy really. 

00:41:05
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL Uh… The next question. What is the purpose of externalization? And, what does this mean for client responsibility? 

00:41:15
JOHN WINSLADE It's two, sort of, different questions, isn't it? 

00:41:20
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL It's a two part question. 

00:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:41:20
KATHIE CROCKET What… I'll just like pick up a wee bit of that question. Is that all right? 

00:41:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:41:30
KATHIE CROCKET And I'm interested in the way… in, you know, at looking at the detail of language. And, like, I prefer to think about externalizing. And we think about externalizing conversations, because I think there's a trap for people new to this, and using the non-externalization, I think that, you know, there's more writing about externalizing conversations. And I think what that shows is some of the fluidity of the conversation. There's a danger of thinking there is, kind of, one singular identified problem which gets externalized. But to think about the nature of the conversational process where we're working to externalize because of this idea these problems, umm… evolve… are produced in social spaces rather than inside a person. So, I guess I just wanted to make that little language point for a start. 

00:42:20
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT So, it's more of a verb than a noun? 

00:42:25
KATHIE CROCKET Yes, yes. Of thinking of the action of… of speaking in ways that are externalizing our problems. 

00:42:35
JOHN WINSLADE More of a process than a thing. 

00:42:35
KATHIE CROCKET Yeah, that's… thing, yes. 

00:42:35
ZOY KAZAN It's a process, yes. 

00:42:40
KATHIE CROCKET Yeah. So that's my first little contribution to that… to that question. 

00:42:40
ZOY KAZAN Yes. And I… I really think about, umm… the… the effect that I see on clients when we have these externalizing conversations. And umm… it seems to free people from blame and shame about problems. Umm… And that enables people then to look at the problem and the ways in which the problem has invited them into patterns of behavior that maybe they are not so proud of. And… And in the process of looking at the effects of the problem on their life, they make… they start to make choices about whether they are gonna allow that to happen again, whether they are going to allow the problem to operate on them in the ways that it has. And that to me is the ultimate taking of responsibility. Because when you say, "I have… I have the choice to either invite the problem in or to block it from coming into my life because it's… it's a thing, it's out there," then you're also saying, umm… "I'm taking… I'm taking responsibility in this process of what happens." Umm… And I'm not… It's not copout anymore. It's not saying, "Oh, well, the problem made me do it." It's saying, "I have power to invite the problem in or keep the problem out." I mean, that's very simplistic. And I work with… with teams and it's fairly concrete in lots of ways. But I… But I think the responsibility issue is a really crucial one. Umm… 

00:44:35
KATHIE CROCKET And I think responsibility can work in a number of ways too, because I was thinking as you were speaking, Zoy, of women who come… who might come to see me and say, "I've got… I've come because I'm… I'm too jealous and I need to do something about myself because I'm too jealous." And then once we start to look at the problem of jealousy and we get to look at who defines jealousy as the problem. The… You know, the… we say where in a sense responsibility for the production of problems might lie. And so, I mean, I guess it's… there's a political dimension to that as well. And… And who gets to name what the problem is, giving attention to how things get named, both the, kind of, parts of speech we use, but who had the naming rights in describing me as jealous and… 

00:45:25
ZOY KAZAN Yes, yes. 

00:45:30
KATHIE CROCKET …and does that first so that people get to, in the same ways make assessments about kind of problems that they are experiencing, but who makes assessments about how we get to name problems and how, umm… you know, problem gets to be inscribed into one person. And we get to then evaluate the kind of relationship that produces them as jealous people. And… 

00:45:55
ZOY KAZAN Right. And the politics of gender that may well be sort of the… the whole discourse around jealousy. And, umm… 

00:46:05
KATHIE CROCKET Yes. Yes. So it's… 

00:46:10
ZOY KAZAN Well, the… the ethics of relationship really, and… and the whole… I'd… I hesitate to use the word "patriarchy," but the power that in western society traditionally men have been ascribed. 

00:46:25
KATHIE CROCKET Yes. 

00:46:25
ZOY KAZAN And… And then we can have conversations about the stereotypes that women… typically women get named as jealous. 

00:46:35
KATHIE CROCKET That's right. 

00:46:35
ZOY KAZAN But men are jealous as well. Men have that problem as well. But it seems to me that until we really look at the power and how that power has been used, and how we get subjected to that power in talking about jealousy. That… That… umm… really moves the problem… the talk about the problem into a different sphere. 

00:47:05
KATHIE CROCKET Yes, yes. 

00:47:05
ZOY KAZAN Doesn't it? It becomes a problem between people that are… that are really operating from constructs about gender that have been, you know, that are much more societal, that are much more widespread than just a couple themselves. 

00:47:20
KATHIE CROCKET That's right, it's the problem in the social world. 

00:47:20
ZOY KAZAN Right. Right. 

00:47:25
KATHIE CROCKET And so we can get questions of… So the kinds of training men may have around relationship… 

00:47:25
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:47:30
KATHIE CROCKET …so that in the same, you know, by taking this sort of a wider eternalizing. Again, you are talking about not finding fault and not blaming that that's one of the effects of externalizing. We can also look at how… the way our culture works produces these kind of problems. 

00:47:45
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:47:50
KATHIE CROCKET So, not only is the person… 

00:47:50
ZOY KAZAN Men… Men are individually… Yes, sorry. 

00:47:50
KATHIE CROCKET You know, the individual not to blame, but in a sense the… the couple or the man isn't to blame. 

00:47:55
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:47:55
KATHIE CROCKET But there's an opportunity for a reassessment of… or an investigation. 

00:48:05
JOHN WINSLADE I think of externalizing as a habit of thinking as well as a way of speaking… 

00:48:10
KATHIE CROCKET Umm… yes. 

00:48:10
JOHN WINSLADE That's… That's umm… not just valuable for clients, but also is… is useful for me in a counselor role, because it… it… it enables the opening of a conversation that… that steps out of essentializing. It steps out of the… the long habit of essentialist thinking. 

00:48:35
KATHIE CROCKET So, it's not just a linguistic device you sort of pull out and use in a counseling session… 

00:48:40
JOHN WINSLADE No, no. 

00:48:40
KATHIE CROCKET …but it's part of your thinking in generally, like… 

00:48:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Yeah. So, whether it's jealousy or whether it's some other problem, umm… I don't think it's helpful to locate it in the essence of the person. Because, as you were just describing in your… in the conversation you two were just having there, the… the thinking that goes into the production of that jealousy, the individual person didn't produce. 

00:49:05
KATHIE CROCKET Yes. 

00:49:05
JOHN WINSLADE And I think that's true for everything, every kind of problem, but to generalize. 

00:49:10
KATHIE CROCKET Yes. You didn't… You didn't make up this problem yourself. 

00:49:10
JOHN WINSLADE Nobody made it up on their own, right. 

00:49:15
KATHIE CROCKET Yes. 

00:49:15
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, therefore the very common therapeutic maneuver of asking people to take responsibility for their problem, doesn't work, I don't think. Well, I mean, I'm not saying it doesn't work in some therapeutic other practice, but what I mean is that it doesn't fit with the… the assumptions, the non-essentializing assumptions that I want to make part of my practice, the way how I think. 

00:49:40
KATHIE CROCKET So, I was thinking, John (inaudible ) was interested in examples. And I mean, I think some of your work in the area of alcohol might be a really good illustration of how that works. Is that an invitation you want to take up? 

00:49:50
JOHN WINSLADE Well, it's possible. I mean, it's a little bit… little bit back in my history, but… but that's… that's fine. I mean, that's an example of a domain in which essentializing thinking has become quite common, in which problems with alcohol are essentialized as being very close to the nature of a particular person. Umm… 

00:50:20
KATHIE CROCKET Without looking at the way in which… 

00:50:20
JOHN WINSLADE The social world I lived in has invited those things forward for people. 

00:50:25
ZOY KAZAN So, that disease model, the idea that they have maybe a genetically induced disease? 

00:50:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. I mean, there has never actually been a genetic link made, you know, despite the many claims about that. And I'm not wanting to get into a critique or an argument with people about alcoholism. I mean, I know that that particular naming… some people find useful, but not everybody. 

00:50:50
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

00:50:55
KATHIE CROCKET But what we would be doing is investigating the ways in which the… the social production of alcohol positions people in particular ways. I mean, we were speaking earlier today, as we… as we drove here, about the difference in behavior towards alcohol amongst young people here as compared with New Zealand. 

00:51:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:51:15
KATHIE CROCKET So, umm… you know, you have different kinds of stories in each… each context. This has gone off externalizing. 

00:51:25
JOHN WINSLADE I was thinking about… in another way too. I mean, I find the practice of thinking and externalizing kind of ways personally useful. You know, like, if I struggled with… say feeling kind of… some kind of doubt about myself in some… some area, to externalize that and think about how that… that kind of… the… the invitations to doubt oneself are all around me in the world, umm… and they are associated with all kinds of, sort of, politics of control of populations, and the government and people and so on. Like the… These are the terms that, I mean, I'm referring to Foucault's analysis of it. Then it's not surprising that there would be times when I would experience that as self-doubt, but to blame myself for it is a very different thing. And to not blame myself, puts it in a very different place. It's not something that's a feature of me. It's not just who I am or it's not an aspect of personality, it's actually a particular pattern of thought that sometimes affects me. And, in other times I, uh… deliberately distance myself from. 

00:52:40
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT So what I think I'm hearing so far about the purpose of externalizing is that it helps to separate the person and their identity from the problem, as separate from the problem. And then I'm wondering if there's a further purpose after that and how you might go forward from that point in terms of, like, that person's relationship with this externalized problem? Is that something that you would go forth with? 

00:53:05
ZOY KAZAN Yes, I think it's really… in their… their relationship with the problems… 

00:53:10
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yeah, how might that… 

00:53:10
ZOY KAZAN A conversation that I think is one that you engage with him about and you keep expanding on, alongside the process of, umm… the ways in which they… they developing other stories that they prefer, that stand outside the problem. So, it's not like you are exclusively focusing on their relation with the problem, but… because you will find these examples of times when they really are outside of the problem and where there in… when they… really engaged in doing something that really is a preference for them. 

00:54:00
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL So externalizing conversations take place around preferences as well, not just problems? 

00:54:05
ZOY KAZAN Well, they lead into conversations about preferences. You have… You're externalizing the problem. You're having this conversation about the impact of the problem on the person's life. And then suddenly you have this example of a time when the problem seemed gigantic and… but… and it seemed like they were really oppressed by it, but at the same time, they did something amazing. So, you have… My favorite story is about a woman who was, umm… about to be raped and in the process of being raped, she tricked the person who was trying to rape her and asked him if he'd like a cigarette and told him that she's gonna go out to the car and get the cigarettes. That have… Let's have a cigarette before they had sex. So she basically calmed him and said, "I'm agreeing to having sex with you, but let me go out to the car and get the cigarettes." And of course she ran away. And so in that process… we are talking about a terrible event, a terrible oppression, and fear that's dominated her whole life since then. But, we're also talking about incredible courage to think on her feet, to find ways to protect herself. And a whole history… a whole other story that is really about her survival and her… her way of looking after herself and her way of, you know, getting herself out of dangerous situations. And so, you know, you think you're really talking about the problem and then suddenly, you… you come across, umm… the other story that's woven in with the problem story that's really about courage and survival and ingenuity and wit and creativity. And… And so as a therapist you are always open to that new story emerging in any situation. And… But externalizing separates that person's identity from being, perhaps, the victim of the rape to being someone who's been powerful. And… And so it's like… like there's two sides to it. 

00:56:20
KATHIE CROCKET Just to pick up where we were before, do you then slide into this relativity thing then if you don't always have to be consistently something or other? I know it's a bit of a devil's advocate question. I'm just saying, it's there, it's sitting there, you know, to be answered. 

00:56:40
JOHN WINSLADE Well… The thing is that I don't actually experience myself as being, umm… in one place all the time. 

00:56:50
KATHIE CROCKET Yes. 

00:56:50
JOHN WINSLADE And so I find it easier to… and more honest to admit that. Umm… And to notice that there are actually more resources that I might call on to… to think about, you know, how or where I prefer to situate myself in… in whatever situation I'm in life. You know, for me, congruence narrows the choices, narrows them down considerably. Umm… What I was talking about before about indeterminacy and complexity, opens a much wider field from which I can be responsible for the choices that I might make. 

00:57:30
KATHIE CROCKET Responsible to? 

00:57:30
JOHN WINSLADE Well, I was thinking just to myself, but to the other people that I met… that I matter to and matter to me. And umm… kind of I'm thinking ethically about you know how I think about umm… the kind of… kind of uses of power that I might use, embody or choose not to use. And I think that those things are ethical choices, if you like. And so for me, kind of, constantly being in the place of making those choices and opening the field up for the possible range of choices that you might make, is actually a really… much more resourceful place to… to live from and to practice from. 

00:58:20
KATHIE CROCKET And so, you know, like I'm seeing the kind of flipside back there… I mean, the work in… in counseling of helping people have a variety of positions then available to them, like, expanding the possible positions available for people to take out, and expanding the kinds of… you know, the use of having conversations that expand people's axis to a range of positions. You liked it? What are you… I'm just interested in your nodding and response. Like what he's saying is to. 

00:58:55
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT To me, I think one of the most powerful things is opening more space, more options, more possibilities when people feel trapped and stuck and… So helping them to see that there are more alternatives, it seems to be very powerful. I was really, really responding to that. 

00:59:15
KATHIE CROCKET Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:15
JOHN WINSLADE At the same time, this… I want to be a little careful with that. I don't want to sometimes imply that there are limitless options that we have, you know, that the options… I mean, you were talking before, Zoy, about working within the context of a mental health system and a funding agency, and things like that. 

00:59:35
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

00:59:35
JOHN WINSLADE And that, you know, there aren't actually limitless options that people have to take. There are sometimes quite narrow ranges of preferences available to them. And to somehow imply that everybody has limitless options, can be kind of a problematic in itself somehow. 

00:59:55
ZOY KAZAN Right. And that brings up the question of class and poverty and… 

01:00:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:00:00
ZOY KAZAN …race and all those issues that actually sometimes really are quite constrictive, you know… 

01:00:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:00:05
ZOY KAZAN …in terms of people's access to therapy in America. That, you know, if you… if you only have access to medical(ph) for all your services then you know, in some areas, that can restrict your choice of who you see. 

01:00:20
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hmm. 

01:00:25
ZOY KAZAN And umm… can really place you in a position where, you know, you may be the only… the only resource available is not very empowering. It might be just the medical model or it might be, umm… a very behavior modification approach to therapy. 

01:00:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, the options and choices that we have are always within sets of relations in a particular context. 

01:00:50
ZOY KAZAN Yes, they are. 

01:00:55
JOHN WINSLADE And they are not limitless in any kind of ideal sense. 

01:01:00
ZOY KAZAN And… And sometimes though you can see someone who appears to have no options and no… very few resources, and somehow managing to negotiate within those limits and expand their resources. 

01:01:15
JOHN WINSLADE Mm-hmm. 

01:01:15
ZOY KAZAN And… And… And sometimes we do get into being advocates and being, you know, umm… inviting other community resources in, with… with the permission of the client, to… to give them access to something that expands their repertoire. 

01:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:01:35
ZOY KAZAN You know, but that… that's often hard work, 'cause… 

01:01:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, coming back to your question about relativism, you know, if anything, I think umm… therapy has to be relative to the particular and material conditions of people's lives. 

01:01:55
ZOY KAZAN Exactly. 

01:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE And if that's relativism, then that's actually realism as well. 

01:02:00
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Uh… Some people saying that Narrative Therapy is or is not within that… that way of thinking of… of you know, is it just one person in the room, you know. I'm not saying that you guys would disagree, but it is a conversation that's out there, and the active… 

01:02:15
JOHN WINSLADE You mean is it a family therapy? 

01:02:15
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Right. 

01:02:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. 

01:02:15
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yes. Yeah. And… And something that comes to my mind is that the more people that are in the room who can co-create a conversation and co-create… look for realistic options, if that's… understanding what you were saying earlier… and what you might say from that topic will be really interesting. 

01:02:40
KATHIE CROCKET It's… It's a question that I relate to because I was trying to umm… process design really for individual's counseling and schools, the guidance and counseling kind of process I guess, and you know, coming to learn later in my career about narrative therapy and seeing how that was… 'cause, I mean, from my position, it looks like it comes out of the family therapy movement. And so what we did in our program at Wichita was kind of put together this program with that particular history of guidance and counseling in schools and in the community, with something that, umm… was very much influenced by family therapy. And we were talking earlier about the kinds of ways in which we are influenced by other therapies, and I think that's not always made explicit. Another thing that was really helpful, and this is bit of sideways, to me in learning these ideas was to see how differently David Epston practiced from the ways in which Michael White practiced, and you know, like, for me, that made Narrative Therapy quite an expansive… you know, that was a many-storied, that wasn't a singular story. So if I answer your question, I mean, I think you can… for me, I can see that having learnt about family therapy through reading rather than in the, sort of, heart of practice as I did, I can trace the family therapy roots. But, I've also had worked to story it and, you know, in the context of a program that hasn't come out of family therapy. I mean… I think that, umm… you know, Michael White said that ideas of audience are intrinsic to these practices. They are not add-ons, they are not extras. And it's, uh… it's… when we started with ideas about context, you know, the… how can we… you know, it doesn't… it no longer makes sense to me to think of an individual as, kind of, the person I work with, even if I am working with an individual. And supervision, you know, like there's a whole raft of people before me, not just the practitioner, who happens to be the person in the room. Is that addressing what you are asking? 

01:04:55
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yeah, I think it is, very much. 

01:05:00
JOHN WINSLADE Do you think if… were you trained as a family therapist, and do you… 

01:05:05
ZOY KAZAN Yes. Well, I wondered first, I always do individual therapy and then I trained in all the family therapy models. So, I did the whole slew of you know bowing in the structural and strategic, and all of that. 

01:05:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:05:15
ZOY KAZAN And I really have… I mean, you never leave that behind. Once you, I think, start thinking about systems, Narrative Therapy just… just is the perfect systems therapy for me, because it just… I know I am and always interested in, you know, the family and who they are and who's important to the person. And of course, in… in… in gay and lesbian and… and bisexual, transgender families, like, who that means and who's in the family and wanting them all in the room at least to be talked about if not a physical presence. And of course, you don't get that with all families. But I'm always interested when there's a family member who's not being mentioned. And I find out about them, you know, six weeks later, that there is another brother in the family that no one's mentioned. And I always want to know, well, is there a secret about this or is there something going on and, what would he think about the story. Even if he never comes to therapy, I'm interested in him as an audience to the process that's happening in the room, and it's, umm… what he would think about new developments in this person's life, and if he'd be the sort of audience they valued or he be someone that they really, you know, would prefer not to know about these new developments, I mean… 

01:06:40
JOHN WINSLADE But do you only work with families or do you work with individuals too? 

01:06:45
ZOY KAZAN Uh… Well, my department, it's mental health department, has a policy of only doing family therapy with the children that we see. And that comes out of a belief that when there's a… a really big problem in a kid's life, that there's probably going to be ripples in the family. Not that it's causal, but that the family itself may be facing a huge crisis in terms of, you know, its social context. And, uh… so we always engage with the parents if we can, and if we can't, we engage with the child and we try to engage the parents as well. So, that I… I do have some latitude of seeing kids on their own and parents on their own combinations. But… But, I think it's wonderful to have them all in the room. 

01:07:30
JOHN WINSLADE You know, I mean, I've worked with individuals a lot, and also with families and couples, and in mediation context with people who are not related, but are in conflict, and for me, what family therapy has contributed is the… is it started the shift from thinking about the, sort of, psychological experience as being totally bounded within the individual person's head, to being actually shaped by the relations, umm… in which people are living on a… on a intimate basis and sometimes a wider basis. But for me, what I think Narrative Therapy has added, has been a shift from thinking in a… in more essentializing ways about systems, about family systems, as if they're somehow, sort of, umm… there's some kind of structural essence to a family, to more thinking about discourse communities. Umm… That… And… And thinking of families as a discourse community and thinking about… that discourse communities exist much more widely than just within families, and that there are, kind of the… the umm… relations that people are engaging in… in… in their lives and in which the problems they are experiencing, uh… are kind of growing up, uh… not just A, of their own making, nor B, just of their family's making, but also part of the cultural community in which they are living. So, it's an… it's an approach that's much more inclusive of the whole cultural context than just simply the family or simply the individual. 

01:09:05
ZOY KAZAN Yes. 

01:09:10
JOHN WINSLADE So… I mean, I think that the family system's thinking is still there, but it's shifted a little. 

01:09:15
ZOY KAZAN Yes, and I think for me it's expanded… 

01:09:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, I agree. 

01:09:15
ZOY KAZAN Like, who… who else can be a witness to this person's struggle? And usually, it can be the biological family. But often it's their friends and community and church people and school people and, you know. In Minnesota County we have this children's system of care. So, if the kid has a probation officer, a mental health worker, social worker, teachers, we have meetings with… with the family every month. 

01:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE Well, yes. 

01:09:45
ZOY KAZAN And, it's amazing to do some Narrative Therapy in a meeting context, you know, without calling it that because… 

01:09:55
JOHN WINSLADE So who's the community that we are… which is having discourse around the problem. 

01:10:00
ZOY KAZAN Right, right. And so… and… and… 

01:10:00
JOHN WINSLADE And they might also be having conversations and more discourse around the… the other possibilities, other than the problem. 

01:10:10
ZOY KAZAN Right, right. 

01:10:10
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL So you… you all briefly mentioned social issues like poverty and race. But I was wondering if you can elaborate more on how Narrative Therapy incorporates matters of social justice. 

01:10:25
KATHIE CROCKET Well, maybe if we pick up… you know, like I think, I mean, we've had a number of examples around, you know, a kind of like what expectations we have of what… what material resources are available to people. I mean, I think the example around jealousy is actually working for social justice. It's not just in my view to work to help a woman be more jealous… be less jealous when she's… in the equitable situation. Umm… Lots of times during this conversation, I've been reminded of a piece of research that one of our students has just done. Umm… Jim Dupree works as a family therapist and he looked at what children are told when parents permanently separate. And he… you know, one of the conversations that's been in my mind as we are of… he wrote about a scenario where, umm… you know, men will say to him, you know, "It's just not fair." And so Jim will have a conversation with him, this man about is fairness important to him. And so get… for the story of this man's preferences for fairness, and then who does the fairness apply to. You know, who… who needs to treated with fairness? Does fairness also include his former partner? Does it include the children and… So, I mean, there's a very political… at the, you know, at the micro level of conversation, a very political conversation that… that it stands… I mean, what I like about that, and I don't know how… if I've even done justice to that small piece of it. But that Jim standing with each of those persons for a just approach in their life, like it isn't blaming a man for, kind of, closing things down. And… but rather asking him about what his values are and what he prefers, and opening the possibility for just relations between people and their family. I think it's in the, you know, it's in the micro moments of the going back into this cold(ph) questioning that every conversation is a political conversation. There's a politics involved in any therapeutic conversation. And I think for me that was one of the most significant, umm… learning, or the significant opportunities that narrative ideas gave me was to… to not be working to teach people a correct, you know, not consciousness rising, but to… to investigate with people the conditions of their own lives. 

01:13:20
ZOY KAZAN Yes, I would support that. And I've just been reflecting on a young client of mine who felt really badly about herself, and who really just would come in and say, "I feel really, umm… just really bad." And she couldn't really put it into words, and we struggled around externalizing it and… and then we ended up talking about racism, and she is Latina and, umm… her grandparents did not know the identity of her father. And she and mother had… were keeping it a secret because they both knew that if the grandparents knew the identity of her father, they may reject her, as they'd rejected other children in the family. They chose to believe that she was Native American. Now that sort of by the by, but… really, the conversation about racism and this particular example of racism and what it had done to the family and the family secrets, was the beginning of a turning point in her starting to really… verbalize umm… a very important strand of thinking that had contributed to the… to the feelings of badness or worthlessness. And we kept it… it was an externalizing conversation, 'cause we never really found a phrase that really fit… fit for her. But, you know, we would just we just use something each time and we'd go with that. But I've noticed that as we've had more conversations about racism and… within the family and at school, that, umm… she's become much more powerful in her own anger at about racism, and in her own value about supporting all of her friends and all of her family, and standing up to that discrimination that she's experienced within the family. 

01:15:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, externalizing there has been about helping her to uh… understand the experience that she's having in a way that doesn't make it just her own or her own problem or something she's doing to herself or umm… so much as it kind of… it's like some… in some dimensions an effect of the context in which she's living and the history… 

01:16:15
ZOY KAZAN Right. 

01:16:15
JOHN WINSLADE …and the… the dividing lines in the society in which she lives. 

01:16:20
ZOY KAZAN Yes, yes. 

01:16:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right? 

01:16:20
ZOY KAZAN And we are really looking at California… 

01:16:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:16:25
ZOY KAZAN …and we are looking at Latinos who come to California as farm laborers. 

01:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:16:30
ZOY KAZAN And the way they are treated by the farm owners. 

01:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:16:35
ZOY KAZAN And that her family typifies that divide. And that we're quite happy to have people come and work in the fields, but not if they marry our children or they become the fathers of their children. You know, it's a very… it's a really insidious social issue in Northern California… everywhere that… And she's caught in that, in the middle of that. And… And really, we're gonna have more conversations. 'Cause even as we talk now, I'm realizing that I haven't expanded that conversation as far as I could. And then the… then the… the link between racism and poverty, like, you know, being in a family where you have three or four siblings and no father, and just how hard it is for the mother to make enough money to provide for the kids without having a man on the scene somewhere. And… And all the politics of gender and poverty and race, and how they intersect in that family, you know. So, feeling bad, it's important to articulate feeling bad, but then to also keep broadening out the questioning. Because every little instance of feeling bad probably had its roots in these bigger discourses. 

01:18:05
KATHIE CROCKET This conversation, just like every meeting that we have with our clients, we… comes to an end. And we're approaching that point. So we are interested to know what's been most interesting for you… and why most interesting? What's, kind of, maybe expanded your ideas? Or what have you liked, what have you enjoyed, what have you want to question? Where would you like to start in responding to what you've heard? 

01:18:30
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Well, I think the thing that may have struck me the most powerfully, is the idea of the faith that the therapist has in the process. And, umm… the idea that the that there will be something good, something useful to be found in (inaudible ), experience of our clients. Umm… And umm… and also, I'm starting to see something a little differently because of today's conversation about questions, and how whether social justice or politics or that faith, it is somehow present in the questions we ask. And that that then has something to do with how this is all very collaborative. It's just a… little thing that's grown in my… my understanding about Narrative Therapy. 

01:19:25
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL I think that what really stands out for me, what I really enjoyed was the talk about the ethical positioning, and that we take with our clients and just in life in general. And then the… the philosophical position behind all of this. It seems much more philosophical than technique. I mean we can't just pick this up like a tool or use the techniques, unless we have the philosophical viewpoint behind it that guides it. So… 

01:19:55
KATHIE CROCKET Well, thank you very much. I mean, I thought it was a… with the things you were saying are some of things that I hope that other people who listen to this will get to hear as well. It's been really interesting to talk with one person who I've talked with, heaps over many years about these ideas, in three people whom I met for the first time today. So, thank you for the opportunity to speak in this way. 

01:20:20
ZOY KAZAN We feel like we didn't give enough of a chance. I would have liked to… 

01:20:25
SARAH CATHERINE STUCHELL We are really… we are really be here, you know, on behalf of questions we get asked frequently, and… 

01:20:30
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Yeah. 

01:20:35
ZOY KAZAN Well, thank you. I… I really enjoyed the conversation. 

01:20:35
RUTH HOUSTON BARRETT Us too. 

01:20:35
ZOY KAZAN Yeah, it was… it was fun. 

01:20:40
