SHANNON DERMER Welcome. Thank you for joining us today. I am Dr. Shannon Dermer from Governors State University. I am the Chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling and I'll be introducing to you in a moment Dr. Terry Christiansen. The two of us will be talking about creating measurable outcomes with clients. Dr Christiansen Terri.

TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Hi, umm… uh, my name is Terry Christiansen and I am an assistant Prof here at Governors State University, umm… I am also a duly licensed School Psychologist and clinical psychologist. I've had 18 years of experience in clinical practice and also 12 years of experience working in the schools, specifically focused on children and adolescents. 

00:01:10
SHANNON DERMER Great! And do you find it that you had to be able to create these measurable outcomes more for your school psychology work or your clinical psychology work or both? 

00:01:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN In both settings it's very important to be able to set goals that we can begin to track and that drive the process of therapy in the private practice setting and in schools of course as we have moved more towards evidence based practice, we very much want to be looking at finding ways to define and measure what it is we are trying to treat and create change in. 

00:01:45
SHANNON DERMER Great! So for personal accountability as counselors, therapists, psychologists, it's good to create measurable outcomes so we can see if we are getting where our clients and, and ourselves want to get with our clients, but then also some systems kind of demand the more measurable outcome like schools, but also insurance agencies and any kind of funding agency typically wants to see a measurable goal or a measurable outcome for counseling or therapy. 

00:02:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I also think clients like to see the progress that they've made over a time in their work. So that becomes a nice way. Again, in the schools it's a very natural process that we are looking at those types of things and settings, those standard criteria. 

00:02:35
SHANNON DERMER That's a really great point because it shouldn't be just about funding agencies or just about you know, oh we can measure this. Then I believe there is some research that shows that for clients the outcomes are more effective if within the first one to three sessions you create some measurable goals and it is because the clients then know where they are supposed to be going, they can see if they are being more successful and I think there is some pride that comes with achieving your goals, you know if they are set out in a measurable way. 

00:03:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely, absolutely. It helps with motivation in the therapeutic process and with motivation towards change and growth. 

00:03:10
SHANNON DERMER Good, which of course is what we want and what most of our clients want also. 

00:03:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:03:15
SHANNON DERMER So what do you think we need to know, what are the basics of what we need to know about creating measurable outcomes? 

00:03:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, one of the things that I think is important, especially as we've moved into this evidence based era, sometimes in the past there has been a tendency to kind of work from a more intuitional type of place. 

00:03:35
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:03:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And the idea of creating measurable goals for some folks can create quite a bit of anxiety. What does a measurable goal look like…? 

00:03:45
SHANNON DERMER For the clinician or for the client? 

00:03:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN For the clinician and the client, it may become a felt pressure. So part of what is a very important consideration is that as we start to have this discussion around goal setting that the therapeutic relationship is very solidified. 

00:04:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:04:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That umm… we are keeping in mind that the client is driving the goal setting process. This shouldn't become about us imposing what we think the client is needing and it needs to be we help to shape those goals umm… and set them up in ways that will help them to be effective as they are reaching them. We can all relate to the idea of having set a New Year's resolution and then having failed miserably in that process. 

00:04:40
SHANNON DERMER I was like, I was setting that up. Yeah. 

00:04:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So what we want to do is set these up in ways that the client is engaged in… or the student and ways that umm… we can support success because we're looking at other barriers that may be in the way that we need to work through as part of that process. 

00:05:00
SHANNON DERMER Okay, so instead of people setting themselves up for failure as we often do sometimes creating measurable goals or measurable outcomes really helps set them up for success, right? 

00:05:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:05:10
SHANNON DERMER It's not just about, ooh we need to fill out this paperwork or it shouldn't be or it's not like ooh, we just need to do this for this funding source. This is supposed to be about the client, about accountability, about motivation and it's going to vary a little bit, I know you'll talk about this, it will vary a little bit by our model. But it's supposed to be collaborative, it's supposed to be from the client's perspective and what the client… the goals the client wants to reach and then we kind of put them in the measurable language. 

00:05:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. So in thinking about the measurable language one of the fun acronyms that's come out as we now talk about goals in terms of smart goals. 

00:05:45
SHANNON DERMER Smart Goals. 

00:05:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Smart Goals. 

00:05:50
SHANNON DERMER S.M.A.R.T. Okay. 

00:05:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN S.M.A.R.T. And when we're looking at that acronym, umm… the S stands for Specific. So we're making sure as we are thinking about goals that we're very specific in those goals, that they are not too loosely formulated in a way that we don't know if we really achieved it. We are thinking about the who, the what, the why, the when, the where and incorporating that language into our goal. The M becomes about the Measurability. So we want to make sure that goal is set up in a way that we can specifically measure it as well. So that we can determine where we are in that process of achieving it. We also want to make sure the goal is Attainable. 

00:06:35
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:06:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That is where many of us fall apart in our own goal setting where we get very excited at the beginning of a New Year and we say we're going to umm… go to the gym seven days a week… 

00:06:45
SHANNON DERMER And never progress me and whatever else. 

00:06:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. So we want to make… think about this and set it up in a way that is attainable. 

00:06:55
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:06:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And support the client and working through the establishment of the goal that's attainable from them, for them where they are at, even if that becomes a matter of setting up sub-goals. We also want the goal to be Realistic and Relevant. So when we're talking about realistic and relevance, we are thinking back to what is the target of the client's work with you, what are their values and we're framing it around their values that around what they've talked about they want to get out of their therapeutic process. And last but not least Timely. So we want to have a definitive endpoint. 

00:07:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:07:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Where they'll know we've all agreed that this is where we are going to decide this goal will be accomplished. So we don't end up in a pattern of procrastination. 

00:07:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay, now let's see how smart I am. It was S.M.A.R.T. S was Specific, M was measurable, A was Attainable, R was Relevant and Realistic and then T was Timely. 

00:08:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Beautiful. Very good. 

00:08:00
SHANNON DERMER And I want to say that my background is solution focused so all of that makes total sense to me because it really fits with that. So what do you do when you say, you know specific, but oftentimes our clients don't come in with very specific goals. They come in with very emotional goals and that's fine but it will be this ambiguous thing like, I just want to be happier. 

00:08:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. So part of that process in getting to identification of some of the core issues, that's why a lot of times before we're going into setting goals, we've had prior work with the client in terms of processing through some of… those types of emotional pieces, trying to gather data and information sometimes through assessment, sometimes through interviewing other people if we were talking about a child for instance we may be talking with teachers, talking with parents and gathering information. So that is we start to conceptualize, get into the case conceptualization and see what the patterns are and help the client to understand what those pattern are. It starts to become more clear as we have those types of conversations, what types of goals we're really starting to need to tackle. 

00:09:25
SHANNON DERMER So you know enough about them, you've done enough assessment and conversations with your clients that you can help guide them a little bit in being more specific. 

00:09:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. That process I think starts to set it up. So for example if somebody has come in and they are struggling with feelings of depression and as they start to talk they've indicated that they've struggled in their past achievement, but they now have a desire to move on to college and as we begin to talk and discuss further issues of variables that may be came into play in the past that impeded their achievement whether it was substance use, whether it was some other emotional types of things that might have been going on in the home setting that we start to look at what role those played and how they worked and sometimes that of course comes from our theoretical orientation as well. 

00:10:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay, so not only do you help them identify some goals, but you might… some of your goals might come from obstacles that they identified in the past and how to get past those obstacles? 

00:10:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:10:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. And it really does depend on your theoretical model because I guess then solution focused that would be a little different and narrative that it would be a little bit different, what's your theoretical model. 

00:10:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I tend to work from a psychodynamic perspective, but I also utilize cognitive behavioral strategies. There is a variety of things that I regularly pull in sometimes based on what the client is bringing to me. 

00:11:00
SHANNON DERMER Okay. And I only smile because you can't get much more opposite between solution focused and psychodynamic. Although there are commonalities in every approach. But it's good to know, actually it's good to know when you are talking about kind of behavior… I think people think of very specific goals when you talk about that. people may not think of as specific goals when you are talking about psychodynamic. So, talk a little bit about, from a psychodynamic perspective what a typical goal might be that includes what the client wants, but also some your theoretical model. 

00:11:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. One that easily comes to mind is in my work with children where oftentimes we are looking at patterns that may be going about through need frustration or attachment types of issues, becomes looking at what those patterns have been overtime and then again just going back to as we identify the pattern and what may be going on relationally setting up specific strategies to work with that pattern and to try to remediate that pattern. 

00:12:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay, now you said need frustration and attachment issues. For those people who may not know what those things are can you just define those briefly? 

00:12:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah, umm… absolutely. So, in terms of thinking about our basic needs and if we start to think about from birth to present where we're at with our needs in terms of some very basic needs for food, water, shelter also needs for love, belonging, safety and security. So unfortunately or fortunately we don't grow up in a bubble and we have need frustration depending on what types of circumstances our parents may be bringing to the table and how that impacts our ability to get those needs met. 

00:12:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay. And you mentioned attachment, so I am going to make an assumption here that if someone has an insecure attachment where they don't feel, like their caretaker is very attuned to them or that they can count on them that that would probably be associated with more need frustration. 

00:13:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:13:15
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So from your psychodynamic perspective then, then some of your goals might be… well first you might do some assessment of need frustration and attachment and then some of the goals might be related to overcoming or dealing or coping with some of those things. 

00:13:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right or looking at situations that might be triggers and then what those triggers end up, what the condition… almost that becomes, sounds a little behavioral but what the response pattern has become overtime to try and cope with the need frustration. 

00:13:45
SHANNON DERMER And how you can interrupt that… interrupt that if it's not being helpful to the client. 

00:13:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:13:50
SHANNON DERMER Now you also mentioned a couple times because I know you do have the school psychology background as well as clinical psychology, children a few times. And I think most of us have an easier time thinking about how to do goals with adults. But talk to me a little bit about children and how you do goals and then specifically measurable outcomes with children. 

00:14:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN It can be quite a similar process because I think children having buy-in in the process of their own work and starting to think about what it is that they want for change, it… obviously the language that you are using may look very different. You may be supporting some of that process with visuals or through play. 

00:14:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:14:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN But there's different ways of getting to that same idea and then setting up again, sometimes charts, sometimes very concrete types of things so that they are able to see their progress and check in around that. 

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay. And now I know from… like I said my solution focused background we tend do not like, what I call like negative goals where it's stopping a behavior, we prefer to have something that they do and instead. So instead of it's we argue less often, it's what you do instead, what you do more often instead as you are arguing less, because it just makes, from my perspective goals easier. What are your thoughts on that? 

00:15:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN very, very much so, what we want to be thinking about is we formulate our language in our smart goals is also going to be framing it in a positive way where we are looking at a skill development and we're framing that skill development instead of looking at it from a deficit angle. We're looking at how we are going to nurture its growth. 

00:15:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good! So can you give me a couple, like typical examples of how you might take an ambiguous goal and then make it into a measurable one, specifically like how you would re-write that goal with a measured one? 

00:15:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So a lot of times therapists and counselors get a little overwhelmed by this process. Maybe it just feels like again the whole idea as soon as we are introducing something measurable or number related… 

00:16:05
SHANNON DERMER They get research planning… start sweating and… 

00:16:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Exactly! But there is some wonderful resources that umm… folks can find on the internet. If they type in and do a search on smart goals there's quite a few worksheets and examples that actually help therapists to walk through that process. And what's nice about it is because you can use those with children, they are very developmentally staged. Umm… So part of that becomes again thinking about, you, you start off as you're looking at this overarching goal and you start to focus it in a little bit more specifically and there is our S side of smart. Umm… But we're thinking again covering that area of who, what, when, where. Is this something that's measureable, is this something that the person can achieve? Sometimes we might overshoot, we overachieve or symptoms overshoot and part of it becomes how do we set that up so that we're set up for success because we want that success to drive how we are going to continue to shape that. We need it to be realistic and we're going to set it up in a timeframe. So we think about those that can kind of become the framework that we guide umm… how we're laying the specific goals out. 

00:17:25
SHANNON DERMER So like, any one of the things, I guess the people come in and say I want to be happy. Now, it's a little bit hard may be for you to do this right here, you're going to do a demonstration a little bit later and so it would be easier for people to see it then, but I know it would be specifically who, what, when, where. So, you know how would… it's so often I might ask clients like how will I recognize when you're happy or what will I see you doing more of instead of lesser. 

00:17:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. 

00:17:50
SHANNON DERMER And who else will notice that. How would be, how will you be happier impact then? So you are getting some of that and not just happier in general but have them really break it down. 

00:18:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Break it down. 

00:18:00
SHANNON DERMER Into different relationships or what you might refer to as needs assessment. You know specifically how will you be happier in this relationship or you know whether that's work or that's with umm… you know, a partner or kids and very specifically into smaller attainable achievable type of things that really come from them. 

00:18:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think a lot of times what we need to remember again going back to what their values are or thinking about it across dimensions and not to be too repetitive in terms of what you just said but we are thinking about multiple areas, about achievement or work. So for a child it might be how am I doing in school and how does that relate to fun. It might be looking at spiritually what does that mean for me and where am I at socially. Umm… So trying to target across various dimension where does fun seem to be breaking down in getting a bit more specific and possibly then identifying some of the key areas. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER Is there a typical need area for kids is to have fun in their lives? You said… 

00:19:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Believe it or not. All right, Believe it or not, yeah I think, umm… more and more we've become a stressed out society and culture and umm… a lots of pressed around achievement and kids often feel that or they are feeling the impact of what those stressors might be at home for their parents. 

00:19:35
SHANNON DERMER So again, I know we are just about out of time, but you know it wouldn't be, oh, I want to get all A's in school, it'd be like no, break it down into what they might do each day in order to help them build toward better grades, how they can still maintain fun in their lives. When they might see doing things for school as the opposite of fun, when it doesn't necessarily have to be, but just really breaking it down instead of these big broad goals into small doable, achievable, meaningful goals. 

00:20:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:20:00
SHANNON DERMER Great! So, any last words of wisdom before we move off to your demonstration. 

00:20:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I, umm… I think goal setting can be a very meaningful process for both the client and the therapist. It umm… becomes helpful guideposts that keep us on track with where we're wanting to go with being able to see the progress that we are making and feeling good about the work that we're doing. 

00:20:30
SHANNON DERMER Good! So goals aren't something you just have to do, they should be an integral part of having a successful and meaningful relationship with your clients. 

00:20:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER Great! Thank you very much, I look forward to your demonstration. 

00:20:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Thank you.

OUTCOMES FOR COUNSELING 

00:20:50
CLIENT SESSION 

00:20:50
with Terri Christiansen, Ph.D. 

00:20:50
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:20:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Hi, Sandy, How are you today? 

00:20:50
SANANDA WOODS Hey, Terri, I am okay. How about you? 

00:20:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Good! I know we've been meeting now for a number of sessions and we've had a chance to get to know one another a bit. umm… And discuss some of the things that you've been coping with, dealing with, things that have been challenging and things that have been really positive and successful for you. So I'm wondering how you might be feeling about taking a step in terms of setting some goals for ourselves in the course of our work. 

00:21:25
SANANDA WOODS I probably should. It will keep me on track. It will make sure I actually get somewhere of my treatment as opposed to staying at square one. 

00:21:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. So, how do you feel about it in terms of have you ever set goals around some of the issues that we've been working on or identified actually? 

00:21:45
SANANDA WOODS No, Terri, never. I never have and I guess that's why I am still having the same problems. It's been a number of years and so I just haven't really moved on until now and so I have never actually had a concrete plan set on paper like we've talked about. 

00:22:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So what we'll do today if it sounds okay with you is we'll start to set some specific goals that will be helpful and I am going to ask you, I have a sense of some of your values and some of the pieces that are on the plate, but let's talk a little bit, about if you had to say in terms of your work in counseling so far, what is an overriding goal that you have. 

00:22:35
SANANDA WOODS The main thing for me is more of about my emotions and being in control of them because I know I have these bouts of depression and I feel suicidal at times and I'm just ready for it to stop. And I know that I have a lot of work to do and I have a long way to go still and so that's why I come here for session after session after session. So, I just, I just really want that emotional control and that, yeah. 

00:22:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. And I know you also have talked about that you have a desire to return to college. So obviously some of those pieces that you've brought up around emotional control around how you are able to think clearly is going to be very important for us to look at. 

00:23:20
SANANDA WOODS I want to make sure I can finish because I've tried college before and I've ended up dropping out after just a semester or I've tried college before and I've gone for thing that I loved like art or drawing and the effect that they… I guess that the college process turns it into work and that there's a great involve… I just, my feelings get tied in knots over it and the pressure makes me just hate the thing that I love and so I just… I just really want to be able to finish. I really want to be able to go to distance. 

00:23:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, great! And I know your story is quite incredible and I know we've had an opportunity where you've updated me on some of the situations that you've been through over the past eight years including your gender transition, including actually being out on your own and homeless for a period of time. Umm… How do you think that fits in with what may be happening with your mood or your thinking. 

00:24:20
SANANDA WOODS This may be a much stronger person Terri. I wasn't as stronger as in control as I am before, I mean I… before I guess I didn't really have a direction and a lot of things were cloudy and I guess I couldn't really see past myself and I know high school was a major problem and my drug use was a major problem before and that was really what spur to leave home and to go find myself. And so I put up a lot. 

00:24:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah, absolutely. 

00:24:50
SANANDA WOODS I had to… I was out during the polar vortex and it was like 20° below zero and I saw a lot of people losing fingers and toes on the street and I… yeah I kind of had a strong community despite having nothing. 

00:25:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah. 

00:25:05
SANANDA WOODS I was at the shelter called the Grid and it was over in Eastern Chicago, it was over on Sun Lake View and it's pretty much Chicago's only LGBTQ youth QU shelter and I spent most of my time there and around the center on Hallstead, so despite having nothing, yeah, I got to know a lot of people and I got to know a lot of people who are like me more importantly and so I could relate to, I could relate to a lot of the struggles that my peers had. 

00:25:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So, you are pretty remarkable in terms of your journey. 

00:25:40
SANANDA WOODS I guess so. 

00:25:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN You want to acknowledge that. good for you. 

00:25:45
SANANDA WOODS Sure. 

00:25:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And a survivor. And it sounds like you are feeling good with where the direction is that you've come. You mentioned substance. Can we talk about that a little bit in terms of… you said previously it was a problem is that currently an issue that you feel is coming into play. 

00:26:05
SANANDA WOODS I started in high school and so it was like by the time I left high school I had these two friends, they were both called John and every about… pretty much every weekend we had… our favorite thing to do was to drink cough syrup and get really high of cough syrup and so we had done this research and we had found out which cough syrups have like dangerous chemicals and like acetaminophen of which you can't overdose of things that will really damage your liver and so, so we really balled down to just Robitussin and Delsym because they both have very specific compounds like just one other chemical like guaifenesin and dextromethorphan and so… 

00:26:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Wow! 

00:26:45
SANANDA WOODS Yeah, it was a safe thing to do when no really… there is not really recorded side effects on dextromethorphan overdoses and the lethal dose of dextromethorphan is so high that in one sitting a person can't consume enough to die. So it would just be like we would get together and do this every week and we would do it during the week and we would all have this like a ritualized trip to Walgreens and we would just make an entire couple of days of it and just… and so I stopped doing that and at this point I am just in the marijuana usage and so… 

00:27:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. 

00:27:20
SANANDA WOODS I've really cut back from a lot of things that I've been doing like I've gotten into a lot of psychedelics and I've never really touched the hard drugs like heroin or crack for cocaine or anything like that, but I've just always done my homework and that's what's kept me safe for so long. 

00:27:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, so from what you were telling me Sandy umm… most of that experimentation was substances a thing of the past, umm… but you mentioned marijuana use. Can you tell me a little bit about how frequently you're currently using? 

00:27:50
SANANDA WOODS So in the past two or three years I haven't got about… I haven't been able to go five days without a smoke. I love it, but at the same time I secretly hate it and I kind of wish that I could stop. 

00:28:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So currently you would say you used how frequently at this point in time? 

00:28:15
SANANDA WOODS Pretty much every day. 

00:28:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. 

00:28:15
SANANDA WOODS I don't want to lie but pretty much every day. 

00:28:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. I understand. Alright, so one of the things that we talked about previously is your depression and ways that we can begin to address your depression that's something that I think you mentioned is really important is your moving on just in terms of your day-to-day well-being and even in terms of functioning at college. So, how would you feel about starting to talk about some goals around the issue of medication and substance? 

00:28:50
SANANDA WOODS I feel positive about it. It's a step that I am ready for it, Terri. 

00:28:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. 

00:28:55
SANANDA WOODS I just… I think that in order for me to succeed I will have to… 

00:29:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. I think so too, I think that's going to be very important as where getting ready for college and really wanting to give it a good go. So, how do you feel about undergoing a substance abuse evaluation? 

00:29:20
SANANDA WOODS I would do it. I know this… I've imagined that it will be hard because I've seen other people, other people's addiction stories and I never want to imagine that I will have an addiction problem Terri. 

00:29:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. Do… I know when we talked in our prior sessions, one of the things that you've mentioned is that you've been failing depressed for a very long time prior to your transition. So the depression piece and the fact that substance may be a way of self medicating. Another consideration that we might want to think about and put on the table is the idea of whether you would feel comfortable meeting with a psychiatrist perhaps to undergo an evaluation where they would make a determination of medication would be helpful to you. What do you think about that idea? 

00:30:10
SANANDA WOODS It's scary. I've heard a lot of things about psyche medications and I've heard about the side effects that they can worsen depression or that they can bring on even worse suicidal thoughts or even worse tendencies and it scares me a little bit. 

00:30:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Sure. 

00:30:25
SANANDA WOODS It scares and I hesitate but I would try. I have to try. 

00:30:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah, it sounds like in the past when you've dealt with substance, you've done the research yourself and this might be heading into a new arena where it's more unfamiliar and a little bit, but I think it would be really important to look at that piece because we really… as I listen to you and you've talked about things like the depression and the fact that substance has been a way of probably self-medicating, it's probably in all likelihood actually made the depression worse. 

00:31:05
SANANDA WOODS You think so? 

00:31:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I do. What do you think? 

00:31:10
SANANDA WOODS I guess so. I mean, well there is many different things as I've done, I am just not the same and I can tell like sometimes my mind works a little bit slower or sometimes my thoughts are foggy and I just… it doesn't, it numbs the pain but it doesn't necessarily make me better. It just helps with my symptoms I guess. 

00:31:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah. So I think as we start to think about using tools that are going to be helpful towards really get at the source of the problem, umm… but it's going to be complex and so I think we're going to need to do work at it from a multifaceted, you know, couple of different directions going on at the same time. umm… I know in our prior session you also mentioned that you though substance played a role in terms of boredom, I think you might you have said. Tell me about that. 

00:32:05
SANANDA WOODS I spent a lot of my life like I… so, while I was in the city I, I was able to move around and I was able to take the CTA and it's just what I came back here to the suburbs it all came back to me the feeling of being trapped because I don't own a car and the feeling of isolation because all my friends are gone and I've decided to be a little bit more true to myself and be who I am, a lot of my friends have just disappeared. A lot of people who can sympathize with me have vanished or gone and a lot of my friends have moved away since high school. 

00:32:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So, I am thinking then what I want to start to do is lay some of this out in terms of measurable goals, some very specific measurable concrete goals that we can lay out for our work. 

00:32:50
SANANDA WOODS Okay. 

00:32:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And for how we can start to move forward and really getting at the root of your depression and supporting some movement that you can feel more positive. Do you feel like you're motivated and ready to do that? 

00:33:05
SANANDA WOODS Of course. 

00:33:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. 

00:33:05
SANANDA WOODS Of course, Terri. 

00:33:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, Great! So looking at the substance how do you feel… we talked a little bit, about moving forward with an evaluation and starting to maybe in the short run what we can also do is look at ways that in, our work we can look at ways to support that. So specifically coming up with some goals around substance which would may be one goal might be to, you know, set a timeframe in which you would undergo an valuation for treatment to determine whether that something that would be necessary and if so what type. How do fee you feel? 

00:33:50
SANDY I think that is a good idea. 

00:33:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, umm… when do you feel like that would be possible to work in with your schedule? 

00:34:00
SANANDA WOODS I should probably start now. I mean, I can only… I only have like a month or so until I have to start college, so I have to start before I leave. 

00:34:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So within the next month you'd be open to setting up a time. So one of our goals then could be that you will contact a substance abuse agency within the next month to schedule an appointment and complete the evaluation, how does that sound to you? 

00:34:35
SANANDA WOODS It's scary and I guess it's just the matter upright but it's scary. I never really want to… I never really wanted to admit that I had a drug addiction problem. 

00:34:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. Yeah, I know it's going to be really hard. That's a big step. I think in terms of looking at that piece especially if one of the things that we've talked about is this notion of addressing the depression through more traditional treatment that would be overseen by a doctor. 

00:35:05
SANANDA WOODS Okay. 

00:35:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That being said we need to kind of be thinking about how recreational use of substance might interact with a medication because that could make that virtually ineffective or could also possibly cause harm. They would definitely want you to talk about that. Do you feel like it's too soon in light of substance abuse to move forward with scheduling an appointment for… to meet with a psychiatrist to determine if medication would be something she or he would think would be helpful at this time? 

00:35:40
SANANDA WOODS Oh, I'm not ready myself but I want to push myself to get it done. 

00:35:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. 

00:35:45
SANANDA WOODS I want to… and I am already on a limited schedule and so I just don't have a lot of time in the world. 

00:35:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, so that being said then how about this setting up another goal where we would… should we use the same timeframe within the next month that you would schedule an appointment and undergo an evaluation with a psychiatrist where what they could determine whether there would be better ways that they could support working on your depression and you could talk about some of the concerns and fears that you have about the medication? 

00:36:25
SANANDA WOODS Yeah. 

00:36:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. If, if that's as that go, something that I want to talk with you because we've had a working relationship it's the idea that it's going to be very important to share with a psychiatrist where you're at in terms of your current substance use and whether that would be something that would impact or have her or him thinking let's wait, let's wait on medication. That's important information for the psychiatrist to have. Does that make sense? 

00:36:55
SANANDA WOODS Yes. 

00:36:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. May be another piece that might be helpful in light of the fact that that's so supportive would be to have me consult with whatever psychiatrist you feel comfortable working with in the future, so what do you think about that idea, would it be helpful or would you rather that I take a backseat with that. 

00:37:15
SANANDA WOODS I think that it would be beneficial to my treatment because I may… you know I may withhold details unintentionally or I might get afraid and so it's like we have a history and you have a record already of where I've been and who I am and… 

00:37:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So another goal that we might consider for is setting up a… having you identify a psychiatrist that you feel comfortable working with and I can certainly provide you with some referrals and we can get a signed consent in what might be a good timeframe to work with that? 

00:37:50
SANANDA WOODS I want to say in the next two or three weeks Terri. 

00:37:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, good. Now one other idea that I had and are you feeling too overwhelmed by the number of goals that we've set already. We've set a goal around you know scheduling and getting a substance evaluation in place. Now we've set a goal with the psychiatrist both. Things that are pretty scary and overwhelming, how do you feel? Do you feel like one more goal would be tip you over into the deep end or… what do you think? 

00:38:20
SANANDA WOODS It's just my… I try not to feel overwhelmed because I keep in mind that it's good for my health and I know I need to do it in order to get the things that I want, but… 

00:38:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay, so maybe we'll wait on that. But one of the things that occurred to me as we were talking is the role of loneliness and you know you're going to be starting in college soon, so you're going to have an opportunity to meet a variety of people. 

00:38:50
SANANDA WOODS Right. 

00:38:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And there is numerous, numerous student organizations and you've got a lot of talents you've shared with me. So I'm wondering if we could connect those passions that you have with some student groups. So it's a natural interest and you're surrounded by like-minded individuals and whether that's a transgender group or whether that would be something related to your major and your interests in those capacities. What do you think? 

00:39:25
SANANDA WOODS The social arena makes me a little… it makes me a little bit shaky, Terri. I am excited but at the same time I'm nervous, I haven't really had… I haven't really had that much human contact. 

00:39:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think we have our work cut out for us and what I want you to do is just keep me posted. You have my number and of course I'll look forward to seeing you next week as well. But, feel free to touch base if, you know, you have any second thoughts as you're thinking through these goals that we're setting or you feel that we need to revise them, that's something we can certainly do. 

00:39:55
SANANDA WOODS Okay. 

00:39:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Otherwise we'll kind of sit with these two big tasks that I think will be very instrumental. 

00:40:05
SANANDA WOODS Yeah. 

00:40:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN towards the movement in the direction that you're wanting to move in with feeling better, thinking better and getting things on track. Does that sound good? 

00:40:15
SANANDA WOODS Umm-hmm. 

00:40:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. Well thank you so much for coming in today. 

00:40:20
SANANDA WOODS Thank you, Terri. 

00:40:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And starting to work on our goals together.

WRAP-UP 

00:40:25
With Terri Christiansen, Ph.D. 

00:40:25
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:40:30
SHANNON DERMER So Terri, thank you for that mock session that demonstration of how to create measurable goals. So that wasn't a real client, that was someone who is pretending to be a client of yours. And you were acting as if you had met for several sessions and you were clarifying goals. Is that correct? 

00:40:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Well, what we were doing was kind of working from this place where we'd had several sessions in theory and we had established a rapport and I had a little bit of a sense of what might be some of the things that were related to what were core issues in the case that we might want to set some goals around and then… but that was our first conversation in regards to, in the mock session about setting up goals trying to really clarify what was the overriding goal and how did that relate to some of the things we discussed in theory in our prior sessions. 

00:41:30
SHANNON DERMER So in some theoretical models they would actually start setting goals in the first session. But from your perspective and that smart goals that you had talked about, you really like to do a little bit more assessment beforehand, you like to hear their story a little bit and then use that to help you help the client set those goals, the smart goal. 

00:41:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right, I think in the way that I would approach that oftentimes I see goal setting is something where people may be have had a history around goal setting and our mock session, this person didn't have you know any prior history. She indicated she had… but a lot of times people have tried different things and they have fallen apart and so I think the notion of goal setting can be a bit overwhelming and I think the idea of being able to motivate them through, it requires a little bit more relationship so I like to wait a little bit further down the line to begin that process to make sure the relationship is very solid and uncomfortable and connected. 

00:42:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. And I guess that the research tends to show the first… within the first three sessions. Now, obviously it could be a little bit longer than that but that really… and actually your mock client hit the nail on the head when she said, "Well, yes, this will help me if we do this, it will help me to know where I am going," and that's actually what some of the research says is that it helps the client to kind of know where he or she is going and also to be able to assess their progress and assess when they have kind of… when it's time to terminate sessions because you've reached your goals. So are there any additional reasons that you'd like to add that you like to set those measurable goals with clients? 

00:43:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think again aside from having some guidepost to drive where we're moving in treatment and giving them a sense of motivation and encouragement around their ability to meet and follow through on certain changes that we're trying to implement. I think it is just a… you know and we want to make sure that we can demonstrate that we're making some nice gains through the course of our work. Sometimes again there are outside variables that come into play whether it's insurance companies or things of that sort that are saying, "Hi! How are you doing here, where are we." In the school setting that's very common to how are we progressing. 

00:43:55
SHANNON DERMER Or Medicare anything like that. I know they are pretty strict and having some measurable goals. I think also I would like to add one more is I think… because it keeps us accountable as, as clinicians, it also keeps our clients accountable. But I also think it makes us be careful that our goals aren't just our goals for the clients in the way that you're talking about them that it is a shared process with our clients that we're not imposing something on them. 

00:44:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:44:25
SHANNON DERMER And I think you know this series that we're talking about here is really about CACREP accreditation standards, you know the counseling accreditation standards but really this applies to psychologists, social workers, counselors, any of the mental health fields that create these goals and it's in the accreditation standards of a lot of different professions. 

00:44:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:44:50
SHANNON DERMER The way you talked about and really it could be over several accreditation areas around assessment, evaluation, but also about clients, about cultural diversity. Actually the way you talk about goal setting, it's a lot of the different accreditation areas. Is there anything else in particular you want to point out about the session that you did or just the smart goals in general? 

00:45:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Oh, gosh! Umm… In terms of the session itself, again I think I want to emphasize that ideally we're helping in our role as counselors or therapists to help shape, pull in specific pieces that maybe we have heard as we've been doing some case conceptualization and then looking at how… what pieces we may need to… we don't want to set a goal for example or let the client be set up for failure in terms of if they are an overachiever and the goal feels too big. We want to help shape it in terms of making it something that's achievable and attainable, realistic. 

00:46:00
SHANNON DERMER Right. The A's and R's of your S.M.A.R.T. goals. 

00:46:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. And thinking in terms of what are some of the emotional blocks that come into place with why these things haven't been happening previous. 

00:46:10
SHANNON DERMER So especially, yes if you are talking about a lot of people have goals that they feel that achieving in the past and so that might be particularly important of like what has gotten in your way in the past of achieving some of these even if they are attainable and realistic. Okay. And I also wanted to point out that in your mock session there was some like big issues that that client was dealing with or had overcome in the past that was complex. I think sometimes people worry that if you are making these small, concrete, achievable, measurable goals that it can't possibly deal with complex issues. What would you say to that idea? 

00:46:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I would say, while I certainly understand that sense. I think it's important that you know once that rapport is there, once we feel that we have a pretty solid handle, I mean I think you brought up the notion of don't wait so long and I think that's a great point and I think in some instances in my experience there are situations where clients are very ready to move into that and what's presenting may be, so more simplistic in a way that we can with something where there's, it's more layered I may wait a little bit longer just to get a sense of what those pieces are so that we can start that. but again I think being able to start even with something that's more simplistic just so that it helps develop momentum in terms of the treatment and therapy is very helpful. 

00:47:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, there is nothing wrong with setting some small goals within the first three and adding onto them later as you get to know that person or if you figure out like, ooh they thought this was kind of what they wanted but may be really this is what they wanted. So there is nothing saying you can't go back and add to or change some goals later on as you get to know the client better. 

00:48:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right and even in the mock session I think, you know, I tried to exemplify that by saying if you know as our session was that yes these were big things, so let me know if this starts to feel overwhelming so that we can modify and quickly start to rework it to make it something that's a better fit. 

00:48:25
SHANNON DERMER Now we didn't talk as much about the T in S.M.A.R.T., the timely part. Now you were saying that it's setting kind of a goal for time like I don't… do you mean like months or do you mean like sessions or what did you mean by the T part of that. 

00:48:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think that can be defined in a variety of ways. But part of it is setting up a definitive time by which we're hoping to accomplish something and if that's measured by three sessions from now we will accomplish this or if it's setting a very specific date, you know, within the next three weeks this is going to happen, we are just looking to contain that and support the motivation of having that done because deadlines help us to stay on track. 

00:49:10
SHANNON DERMER Yes. There are few deadlines right now… I need… and one of them is that we only have about a minute left here for our discussion. So I just want to also say that it's… would you also say that you try to set some like shorter term goals so they experience some as long as may be some longer term achievable, realistic goals? 

00:49:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think, you heard in the mock session that we were setting goals within a four week timeframe and part of what that was what's based on oftentimes in my experience what I have found clients aren't able to get into a psychiatrist until a four week period. So while that may have seemed like a long-term goal in reality I was trying to set that… help frame that in a way that the client could feel successful and actually be able to accomplish it as opposed to feeling some anxiety around. I can't get in. 

00:50:05
SHANNON DERMER Great! So then you know the smart goals, they can be short-term, they can be a mid-range, they can be longer-term, but they should always be specific, measurable, achievable, uh oh what was R? 

00:50:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Realistic. 

00:50:15
SHANNON DERMER Realistic and what? 

00:50:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN And relevant. 

00:50:20
SHANNON DERMER And relevant and timely. 

00:50:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah, absolutely. 

00:50:20
SHANNON DERMER Great! So I want to thank you Dr. Christiansen and I want to thank all of you for joining us for CACREP Essential Skills for Counseling Practice. I hope you learned as much, if not more than I did today. I appreciate Dr. Christiansen's time and her knowledge. Thank you.
