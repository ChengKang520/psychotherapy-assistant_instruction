Dr. Tom Sweeney COUNSELOR EDUCATOR 

00:00:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY The Graying of America represents one of the most important social and cultural developments of this century and the next. As a consequence, it deserves or requires careful study by anyone who will practice counseling in the future. In the following interview, Dr. Jane Myers, project director for the curriculum and video series on gerontological counseling, discusses her perspective on the Graying of America. 

00:01:05
Dr. Jane Myers GERONTOLOGICAL EXPERT 

00:01:05
DR. JANE MYERS  The Graying of America refers to some major shifts in our population demography that have occurred primarily since the turn of the century. And they have escalated since about the mid century and, and will continue to change. Mainly, what it refers to is that there are many, many, many more older persons than there used to be. The older population is the fastest growing segment of our country, and the old, old, the 85 and over are singularly the fastest growing segment of the population. So not only are there more old people, there are more old, old people, people are living longer, and the longer they live, the longer they can expect to live. So if you're, ah, tsk, born today, you can expect to live to be in your 70s. But if you're 60 today, you're going to expect to live into your 80s. Older people are survivors. And, as the population continues to age as there are more older persons, there are proportionately less younger persons in the population. So you, you will see more older people. That, of course, is significant for counselors because our population base of clients that we serve will increasingly be adults and older persons. There is almost no way anymore for a counselor to work in any agency and not encountered older persons as clients. 

00:02:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY While it is beyond the scope of this program alone, the study of shifting demographics can include many social and cultural implications, the economics of age, age prejudice and intergenerational conflicts. And this still represents the tip of the proverbial iceberg. How do we cope with the concerns of older persons? Concerns which have only recently received notoriety. These include everything from stress, elder abuse, drug misuse and abuse, alcohol abuse, age discrimination, and caregiver needs. In short, this is a topic with broad implications and many complexities. In this program, we'll touch on aspects of these related to changes and lifestyle, and roles of both men and women, some of the economics of aging, age prejudice, and special concerns related to elder abuse and related issues. Some of these are best represented by illustrations taken from interviews in group sessions with older persons of various ages, sex, marital and economic status. One author characterized old age as a tragedy for many elderly Americans. I asked Dr. Myers, what circumstances contributed to this assessment? 

00:03:30
DR. JANE MYERS  There has been at least one author who has categorized old age as a tragedy for Americans, older Americans. Primarily, no, I don't think I can say primarily. There are a lot of reasons for that. Many of the people who have studied aging or just the people who have looked at aging depict it as a time of loss. In your younger years, you are experiencing a series of opening doors in your life, and new opportunities and new possibilities. And as people get older, there are fewer possibilities, and fewer opportunities and doors closed, and you may not have a lot of control over what happens. Older persons may experience the loss of friends through, through moving away or through death, the loss of a spouse, the loss of jobs, the loss of a variety of roles such as mother, or a housewife, or worker, or volunteer worker or whatever happens to be, and there are fewer roles to replace those with. So, older persons have less opportunities in this country than persons of other ages. And, in many ways, their social and economic conditions are less. About one of five old Americans today are at the poverty level, and that may have occurred for the first time when they grow old. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Uh hmm. 

00:04:45
DR. JANE MYERS So, that they live a productive, happy life until they grow old, and then suddenly their circumstances change dramatically, which is a tragedy for many persons. 

00:04:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Fifty-seven percent of older persons are women, and most of them are single. Only 40 percent of older women are married, while 77 percent of older men are married. There are five times as many widows as there are widowers. Over the age of 55, the remarriage rate of widowers is more than five times than for widows. These statistics alone carry within them many implications for lifestyle and roles of older persons. Dr. Myers discusses some of the issues related to these demographics. 

00:05:20
DR. JANE MYERS There is no doubt about it. Old age means for many people, old women. In fact, some authors have said that, that the problems of old age are the problems of women because there are so many older women than older men. It's true that women outlive men by seven to 10 years. So, if women marry men a few years older than them, which is, has been the trend, then they can expect to outlive their husbands, and they can expect to be widows. A few years ago, the statistic you heard was that women could expect to be widowed for eight to 10 years. The most recent statistics I saw based on census, 1980 census data, said that the average American woman can expect to be widowed for up to 25 years. Now, that's, that's a third of somebody's lifetime. And yet, when you look at what we're telling children, we're saying you're going to grow up and you're going to get married and you're going to have family and live happily ever after. And that's turned out to be a myth for many, many older women. And for many of them, they lived with their families and then they lived with their husbands and with their children. And the day their husband died, they suddenly were alone for the first time in their life and were going to live another 20, 25 years that way. Nobody told them that it was going to be that way, and they have no role models for what to do or how to behave or who to be. And, certainly, there's an area where counselors can step in and say, "Well, let's talk about this. This is, this is incredible. This is painful. And how are you going to survive?" Only what happens when counselors work with older people, it's not how are you going to, it's, wow, look what you're doing. Because so many people are just coping and adapting. The older people that, that we, you know, if I say we because I'm part of society, and society in general has this negative conception. Expect to see as passive and, and withdrawn from society are very active and very involved. For too long, most of the information we had about older people was based on half the population like school children. We know a lot about school children. We know more than anybody wants to know about undergraduate psychology students because they get college credit for filling out our questionnaires. But you can't find old people to study them. Four to five percent, like, as you've mentioned, are in institutional settings, 10 to 15 percent maybe homebound, and 80 percent are out doing their own thing. When was the last time that you, for example, were included in a national survey? Who came and knocked on your door? I've never been included in one. And when I read studies about the general population, I say, well, that's not me. And a lot of older people say the same thing. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:07:55
DR. JANE MYERS This is what older people are supposed to be like, but that's not me. 

00:08:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY There are a number of issues which relate to economics and aging. As it's true of many such topics, economics is intertwined with other issues, such as discrimination. If we acknowledge that women have not been equals in pay, benefits, or opportunities in the marketplace, then it should come as no great surprise that they do not do better in their later years either. In fact, in the most recent census, one half of all older women were on poverty level incomes. Even in the period of economic stability, such as we have today, living on a fixed income is difficult. To help us understand this better, let's hear what it's like from some fairly representative women living on modest incomes. 

00:08:40
DR. JANE MYERS And then the services that you pretty much have to have go up without your having any say about it. 

00:08:45
MARY That's right. We just. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN And then every year, your, your rent goes up. 

00:08:50
MARY That's true. Just. (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN And the medication that they take, most of them are... (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
MARY  Go up. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN ...have to go to the doctor's bill and things that they have that. 

00:08:55
ELEANOR  Every year, it goes up and Medicare gives us what is, ah, .3%, which is hardly anything or, added to you. And just as soon as that news hits the, worldwide and groceries go up, and medication goes up, and the doctor bills go up, you know? And so... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
MARY And so we're getting this way out (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
ELEANOR ...we are getting with all of this with just a little percentage of food increase. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Really (inaudible ) it would go up worse. 

00:09:20
MARY If you get two, if you get an increase of $3 it will cost you, the average of $28 a month for that increase that you've leased in whatever you previously had. 

00:09:30
DR. JANE MYERS How do you adjust to that? Do you develop budgets or? 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN Well, you have to. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
DR. JANE MYERS You have to do. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
MARY You just do. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
DR. JANE MYERS Without less? 

00:09:35
ELEANOR (Laughs) Or go without more. 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN  Even without more. (Laughs) 

00:09:40
DR. JANE MYERS It's exactly what you do. 

00:09:40
ELEANOR (inaudible ) when you have less. 

00:09:42
UNKNOWN That you have to be able to budget. 

00:09:42
DR. JANE MYERS You have a budget that, is it written out? 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Ah, no, it's in my head. Uhm, I can go to the grocery store and I can take a certain amount of money. And I will always stop before I've got else(ph), before I've got it spent, the main(ph), always know when to quit. 

00:10:05
DR. JANE MYERS Because you're used to doing it. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:10:05
DR. JANE MYERS Do you, do you have a budget Mary? 

00:10:10
MARY Well, it, like she said, in my, in my head, I did because I know where my bills are, and then what I can do even if I have to come within that or stay as, underrated as much as possible. But that's bad because I've had car trouble, and I've lost a tooth from not being able to have the extra money to go when I should have gone to the dentist... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
DR. JANE MYERS Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
MARY ...because of all these other bills that I have to pay, you know? 

00:10:40
DR. JANE MYERS And something comes along. (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
MARY If something comes along and you're just, ah, you're just then lost. 

00:10:45
DR. JANE MYERS Meanwhile, you got your painting classes and it's kind of a financial strain to do something that somebody. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
MARY Yeah, that is, that is, really, because they've asked for donations, you know, to help with that but so far, it has been, to that I know of. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Hmm(ph), (inaudible ) like, like my activities in the building. I don't, ah, I'd both get reimbursed for some of it but I don't never tell them all of it, so I put a lot of it on my own shoulder. 

00:11:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN But the first thing that comes out is my money to my church. 

00:11:20
DR. JANE MYERS Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN He thought that I'd make a lot of pledges and I, I, God can multiply what you have. So, ah, I send a lot of money around the world, not a lot of money, but to me, it is. 

00:11:35
DR. JANE MYERS Uh hmm. That is the most that you can do. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:11:35
DR. JANE MYERS Gives you a nice feeling. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN I make a lot of pledges and I've called on the phone, ah, let (inaudible ) Pat Boone called and wondered if I could have one of, a certain project. So I told her to put me down for a certain amount of money, I get calls from, ah, Billy Graham and, ah, uhm, Charlton Heston and you, you name it, and I get them. 

00:12:00
DR. JANE MYERS Because they know you're willing to help. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN They know I'm (inaudible ) softie. 

00:12:05
DR. JANE MYERS How about you, Eleanor, do you have to have a budget, too? 

00:12:05
ELEANOR  Well, I'm like the other two. I'm, bills come first, and then what's left, then I try to live on it. 

00:12:15
DR. JANE MYERS So, hmm, and what. (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
MARY  You don't really have enough to plan a planned budget, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
MARY You just name it, it's there and that's. 

00:12:25
ELEANOR Yeah, and so many doctor bills, too, this last year, and Mary (laughs) takes a lot for that. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
DR. JANE MYERS  Both of you sound like medical bills are, are among the highest items that you have to pay out. 

00:12:35
ELEANOR  Well, it has been in this year. 

00:12:40
DR. JANE MYERS What's been different this year? 

00:12:45
ELEANOR Well, I had this uhm, what they call polymyalgia, which hit me last October, you know, and I've had trouble with my heart because of medications so I've had to have a doctor for that, a cardiologist, (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
DR. JANE MYERS Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
ELEANOR uhm, and so I said I have a cardiologist and an ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist. (laughs) I've never had all these things before and it's really, it's not funny but it's, it's, you know, it's, it's the necessity. 

00:13:15
DR. JANE MYERS Yeah. 

00:13:15
ELEANOR I don't know. 

00:13:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY I indicated earlier that these issues get intertwined, but I want to share the observations of one of our own, Dr. Thelma Vriend. Thelma took early retirement for health reasons but remains active as a teacher and consultant. As a professional counselor and supervisor, she is well known for her leadership and advocacy for counselors and their clients. In this interview, she is sharing her experience and perceptions on the job market for those 50 years of age or older. 

00:13:40
Thelma Vriend RETIRED COUNSELOR SUPERVISOR 

00:13:40
THELMA VRIEND  People are reluctant to believe this younger people. Ah, uhm, I remember this research class where I was talking about the fact that, ah, when you're older it's harder to, to get your foot enough to work, to get a job that people just do not pick your resume out of the pile. And they were saying, "Oh, no, this isn't true," you know? And then some of the women in the class, who were a bit older were saying, "Oh, no, that's not true of you," and I said, "Oh, yes, that is true of me." Even after the class was over, some of them came up to me to say, "Ah, you, I hope don't really believe that because you see, you have so much to give and you are so alive, and so vital and ah," And I said, "Yes, I am all of those things." However, I do not get picked out of the, a pile of paper because nobody knows that. They just see the, the age. They see the number. Or, if they do see me in person, they see the gray hair. And the rest is lost until you, you know, really get to know the person. Now, I don't feel that I'm at a disadvantage. Personally, I feel that I can do and that I have a lot to give but society doesn't, generally, does not believe this. 

00:15:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY  As Dr. Myers notes in her comments, other forms of age discrimination hit older persons when they're least able to cope with it. 

00:15:25
DR. JANE MYERS When we talk about age discrimination, the, the question always comes up, "Aren't things better than they used to be?" And some of the recent studies on attitude research, particularly the ones where you, you rank disabilities according to the ones who, that would be the least offensive to you or most offensive to you, old age has moved up in the hierarchy. It is no longer the most offensive condition of people over the last ten years. It's, it's moved up in the hierarchy to, you know, number five or number six. It's not so bad to be old anymore. But that doesn't mean there's not a lot of widespread bias and discrimination against older persons. And while most people will say, if you ask them, "No, I don't discriminate against older people." "No, I think they're okay." If you deal with an individual older person and ask them about instances of discrimination they've experienced, they are liable to be a lot, and unfortunately, when they experience the most discriminations when they're the most vulnerable. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. 

00:16:15
DR. JANE MYERS When they're active and involved and working and people just kind of accept them like everyone else. But when they're living alone and they may be unhealthy and they need the attention of service providers, then sometimes it's not so easy to say "Well, here's somebody who's just like everyone else." 

00:16:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. 

00:16:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Let's hear discrimination from a slightly different perspective. Ask yourself how you would feel if you or one of your loved ones got the same treatment as the woman sharing her experience with a broken foot. 

00:16:45
DR. JANE MYERS Mary, you've been, just been living with pain a short time. You didn't tell us before what happened to your ankle. 

00:16:50
MARY Well, in February, it was raining one morning. I was going over to the clubhouse where we have our RSVP(ph), which is a volunteer work, making little (inaudible ) robes(ph) and cards and different things for, ah, and to give to the nursing homes and different things. Well, anyway, I didn't see the pothole and I stepped in and it twisted my ankle, and it broke it in the joint. Well, I went, finally, I called my doctor, and, ah, he was not there so, being on Medicare, you know, you just don't want to have(ph) the doctor. So I thought, well, maybe I just sprained it so I tried getting around for several days, and finally, I just, ah, well, ah, I might, had made an appointment because he'd be, knock on Friday. Well, it was a stormy day and when my grandson broke the car, I've got a pair of crutches and got to the doctor and they x-rayed it. They didn't find, they didn't find the break, so that made me hobble around four more weeks with a broken ankle. And we tell them every day, calling them and saying, "Please, I know it's broken," I said, because every time, I hold my foot down or lift my foot, I just about to go into orbit. And finally, I get back down there after a month, and, uhm, talking to two more doctors. They'd looked at it and they just, just passed me all by, you know, just like I was suck(ph) in my health... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:18:30
MARY ...didn't bother to x-ray it. So I really got disgusted, and I, they tell me if it still hurt, come on back and I said, "I don't know how it might hurt you want one to do." Well, the nurse told me that my doctor wouldn't be back until, I guess, he wont maybe ah, Thursday or Friday and to, call on me, uhm, because she'd made it before. And I told him, I said, "I could hardly make it in here." And I said, "My, my foot is just as bad or worse than it was when I first came here." And he said, "Well we better x-ray it." So he x-rayed it and found that it was purple and all white through the joint. So he sends me to this older doc, to Doctor Blake who put the cast over it. I had a big cast for a while. So I've been going back to him with it and he said he had done little healing and that, ah, he may have to do some bone grafting and so I won't go back until the 21st, but I think it's gonna be okay. 

00:19:40
DR. JANE MYERS Let me make sure I have this straight. You, you hurt your ankle and you went to the doctor and said you thought it was broken and... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
DR. JANE MYERS ...they looked at it and didn't x-ray it. 

00:19:50
MARY No, he x-rayed it, (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
DR. JANE MYERS Oh(ph), he(ph). 

00:19:50
MARY but he, he said it didn't show in the first x-ray. 

00:19:55
DR. JANE MYERS Oh, okay. 

00:19:55
MARY Hmm(ph). 

00:19:55
DR. JANE MYERS It was a month later before the break showed. (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
MARY  Before, before I convinced him it was broken that they made a second x-ray and found it was broken. 

00:20:05
DR. JANE MYERS Did they wrap it for you the first time? 

00:20:05
MARY No. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN  Hmm, that's why I don't like doctors. 

00:20:10
MARY  No. As I said, I had been doing everything that, ah, anybody would do for sprain, you know? Ah, they told me to keep it elevated, which I tried to do and I had a bad, I have a bad back. They told me to keep it elevated and so it would heal or mend or whatever. And, ah, if I felt, ah, if it relieved some of the pain to put ice packs and then do it in warm water, which I did all that. And I borrowed a wheelchair and I borrowed crutches (laugh). And here I am just, you know, just, every time I'm thankful for I don't have to spend any money sending me on a trip to the moon 'coz I'm gonna make it (laugh) without it, you know? The pain is so bad, and trying to convince them that, that it, that it had to be broken for it to hurt so bad. 

00:21:05
DR. JANE MYERS  And how did you feel when they finally said it was broken? 

00:21:10
MARY Well, I knew it was. I mean, I was, I was relieved that the stupid (laugh) people. Would I, I didn't mean it, you know? 

00:21:20
DR. JANE MYERS Did they apologize to you? 

00:21:20
MARY Well, not very much. 

00:21:25
DR. JANE MYERS Oh, I would find that particularly frustrating to you. 

00:21:30
MARY It is. Very much so, (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
DR. JANE MYERS (inaudible ). 

00:21:34
MARY but I'll tell you why. I think that before it's over, I hope to tell him, you know, in a real nice way, that when somebody tries to tell them that they're hurt, don't think it's just because they're old and got aches and pains, that they're, gotta believe something in it, and if they keep telling you over and over that should go ahead and x-ray again. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. JANE MYERS Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
MARY It's not gonna cost them anything. 

00:21:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY  We could give you countless illustrations of similar situations which our older population must endure daily. Clearly as a society, we have a great deal to rectify in the whole area of human rights. Lifestyle changes are inevitable. As we will illustrate in later programs, there's a great deal which can be done to help others prepare for and cope with their later years. Research has shown that those who anticipate and plan are likely to cope more successfully. You may ask, what are some of the challenges we can anticipate? Because women are the majority of older persons, far less is known about men. One statistic which surprises many people concerns suicides. Suicide rates are significantly higher for all men than females in all age groups, but suicide rates among older white males are more than four times the national average, while for all the women, it is only twice the national average. What factors contribute to these statistics remained to be discovered. There are no doubt, many factors which are important, but some do not require waiting for study results. For example, elder abuse is a growing concern. In the following interview, you will hear the plight of one such man. In the absence of proper rehabilitation after a stroke in 1971, this man's condition deteriorated to the point where he is totally dependent upon a niece who uses his social security money to buy her illegal drugs. His only decent meals are from the senior center, and then only when the transportation is provided free. 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN I've been living in an apartment of my own. I got to live good. good, uhm, because I started to move (inaudible ). Sometimes, I'd to have very little before that (inaudible ). I couldn't get up, (inaudible ) sitting and wanted (inaudible ) where I can get up. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN And that he didn't get out of it and she, she's got to show (inaudible ) therefore. And then (inaudible ). 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN So you used to live by yourself in an apartment and now, you're living with your niece? 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Niece, niece yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Yes. And how long have you been living with your niece? 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) since, just before Christmas. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Just before Christmas? 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN And so, it was, yeah. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Okay. And did she get money for helping to take care of you, you know, your money? 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Yes sir. She gets it all.

MS. KAYLEEN LEMONT  This building is owned by the Detroit Parks and Recreation Department. It's used by us during the daytime for senior citizens' program and then in the afternoon around three o'clock, it's used by the children in the neighborhood for a recreation program. Recreation activity program. In the summertime, it's used by the children both during the day, and at night, and by us during the day. We'd share our space during the summer. At night, a lot of times it's used for community functions, community meetings. We have, uhm, a center watch program out of here and there also is a neighborhood watch program. So it's, it's truly a community-based program where people come of all ages to find services and what's going on in their neighborhood. It's a ve, it's a great center, it's a big center picking(ph) out a large population here, and it's used by a lot of people. 

00:25:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY Can you tell me more about some of the kinds of activities there are for older persons? 

00:25:35
MS. KAYLEEN LEMONT Sure. The, uhm, Reuther Senior Centers have what we call the multi-purpose center. We try to cover all the bases of what a senior would be interested in, what they would like to do. We offer socialization, which we do through our Food and Friendship Program. We have a hot meal here every day. Ah, it's a government program, a hot lunch every day. We have, uhm, educational programs offered through the Detroit Board of Education through, ah, Wayne County Community College, through the Oak, Oakland Continuum Center. We try to cover their health. We have programs, ah, from our local hospitals that come in and we do blood pressure screenings here twice a month. We also do any kind of health education program that we can do. We have glaucoma screenings. We have cholesterol screenings. We have large health screenings once a year that are offered and in conjunction with hospitals and, and, ah, neighborhood centers and such. We try to offer, uhm, help with problems of everyday living. We have social workers on staff who do counseling for seniors. We also, uhm, crime is a big focus for seniors. Ah, in living in our inner city neighborhoods, the fear of crime is, it's very high. So we have a program where we put locks on people's doors and we do glazing on windows. We close all the milk chutes. We try to make them feel safe in their homes. Partly, that goes along with our center watch program, then they should feel safe in coming to our center, so we help them by getting here. We, ah, send cabs to some people so that they can come. We try to, uhm, offer the seniors an opportunity to improve themselves, the, to go past the feeling that at 65, it's all over. (laughs) And, ah, we try to, ah, offer opportunities for them to get out. We have trips once a month out of our center, so that if they don't feel comfortable traveling by themselves, they travel with us. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. 

00:27:35
MS. KAYLEEN LEMONT We have, uhm, a multitude of services as far as, uhm, counseling. As I said before, counseling services trying to offer them help with any of their everyday problems they feel at home. 

00:27:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY  There's much more to share than we can accomplish in one program. The concerns of older persons are multiple, and they touch the lives of virtually everyone. Aging is inevitable. It is a family matter. It is a personal matter. None of us can say that it won't affect our lives in some way. The question is when, and through whom. As counselors, we have an opportunity to help others cope as successfully as they can with the aging process. In doing so, we can learn from them how to cope more successfully with this process, in our own lives.
