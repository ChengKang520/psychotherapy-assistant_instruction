BODY & SOUL 

00:01:35
GAIL HARRIS Hello I’m Gail Harris, welcome to Body and Soul. Did you ever sit by yourself in some peaceful place by a river perhaps or maybe upon a mountain top turn your face to the sun, take a deep breath and realize just how great you felt in that moment well that is what wellness is. Not just the absence of disease, but a feeling of being completely and joyfully alive. As you’re about to discover in the next half hour that’s a feeling that you can create for yourself everyday. 

00:02:10
Creating Wellness Taking Time, Making Time 

00:02:15
NARRATOR Every year the Omega Institute in upstate New York helps hundreds of people reinvent their lives. Their wellness workshop emphasis diet, meditation and exercise. But the most important piece of the puzzle is how to find life in places you may not have looked before. 

00:02:35
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN, MD Co-founder, Omega Institute So there was a woman who was going snorkeling and her mission was to see all the fish. So she starts snorkeling, she starts going after the fish. She is going like this, she is New York rhythm you know. She is going after the fish you know. She is going to see them all and the more she does this she wasn’t seeing any of the fish. So naturally what we do is, we are not, we are not getting when we want, we go faster. So she started going faster so then I wasn’t seeing any fish and she said finally I got exhausted. When I got exhausted I just floated their, all of the sudden all the fish came out. When she was going really fast, she looked like a predator as like she was a shark because she was after the fish. When she slowed down she came into the rhythm of the sea and she was no longer, she was in the right rhythm. And then everything shows up and I find in my life that when I’m able to shift appropriately into the right rhythm life shows up. 

00:03:45
ROB OBERNDORF Cleveland, Ohio At this point in time in my life, I’m trying to get back in touch with my spiritual side. Sometime after I graduated from law school and started working. I lost touch with that side of myself. Suddenly, I was in a situation where I’m thinking well who exactly am I anyways. And I was struggling with I remember this person from the past and he was very relaxed and very self-assured and where did he go. 

00:04:20
IRINA MICHELETTI Grahamsville, New York I believe that we live at frantic pace. We don’t have enough time to relax, we go from one activity to the next. We don’t really know ourselves. We don’t know our, our children. We don’t know our spouses because we’re constantly on the move. We’re constantly looking for something. And then pious you reach the certain point of your life and… and all of this kind of hits and you say, "Hey where did all the time go?" 

00:04:50
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN We get stuck in fast forward what’s happening to so many people is we are running the marathon of life as though it is at the pace of a hundred yard dash that’s why we die of heart disease. 

00:05:00
 Move so slowly and ant in front of you has time to get out of the way. Move so softly that same ant will feel or hear the thud of you catching yourself. Practice slowing down a little bit more, moving slowly and gently with the arms. No hurry, we are not rushing to the end to get it over with to get to the next thing. And stay we are just taking a walk for it’s own thing.

MARC COHEN Senior Faculty, Wellness Program Most people and this means most people that you know, most of your family members, most of your friends, most of your co-workers, most of your acquaintances of all kinds are experiencing very, very, very, very high levels of stress. This is most people and the second part of that is that most people are experiencing high levels of stress and don’t even know it. And we don’t know it because we’re so used to living in high levels of stress. We have become completely unconscious of it’s presence until we start getting whapped by it. If you can imagine yourself driving down the interstate going 70 miles an hour and there is a very loud noise starts emanating from the engine compartment of the car. What do you think would be a great solution especially if you’re in a rush to that? Right turn the radio on really loud. Okay, okay now that, now that sounds really stupid okay. But, but many of us do that you know many of us in our own ways when we are getting messages from our body that some things out of balance that we need to be paying attention to something that we need to be changing our schedule little bit that we need to be changing the way we are living our lives a little bit, we will opt the stimulation in our lives. Much more stimulation, much more activity so we don’t have to pay attention to that message because that message scares us. 

00:07:20
 Okay now breathing in, leading with the chin coming forward, it’s a forward fold. 

00:07:30
ROB OBERNDORF A few years back I really start to get into a phase of my life where I set my job, I graduated from law school. What I was doing was considered to be very successful and I was good at it. And suddenly I was thinking myself no what, maybe I should give this, maybe I should give that. Maybe I should go and work for big law firm and make more money. So suddenly the mind went hmmm… hmmm… and I had all these questions but not really any sort of grounding on which… answer the questions. 

00:08:05
IRINA MICHELETTI You’ve parents who are sick. You’ve your child who is going way to college. You’ve the fact that you are now, you know in your 50’s and I think these are all normal things but we would never really been taught to how to deal with them. 

00:08:15
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN What you feel like when you’re stuck into traffic jam, terrible, angry, enraged, wasting time, frustrated. You see to me somebody just came in and gave you some time. And here you all pissed off even complaining you are not having any time, you got some time. What are you going do with it? I’ll be pissed off that I’ve time. How dare they give me the time? I didn’t wanted to be this way. Time shows up and we got oh no I don’t want time right now. I want to get it done so I can have time later. This time wasn’t what was I taking about. I was talking about time that was really good. What I’m talking about is the application of meditation into everyday life. So that when you’re waiting for the elevator to come and it’s just not coming. You’re not going when is it going to come in that rhythm. We just to go shh… here I'm. The remarkable thing is as you start to open little window throughout the course of your day life opens up. 

00:09:30

00:09:50
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN And one of the things you see in sports star is that the ability to focus fully on the moment. Michael Jordan with a few seconds left in the game, he is so focused. And yet he walks up the court as though he is at the Sunday stroll, just a few seconds down by one point championship on line. But you know the ball is going to go in and part of his ability to do that is because there was nowhere that he would rather be. He is not going oh my god we better get in because if we don't we are gonna to lose the championship, it's not that at all. There is no fear rather what it is about is I don’t want to be anywhere else. I loved being right here. I mean make this moment forever. So when we talk about wellness from my perspective the whole door to wellness is allowing ourselves more opening of this present moment. 

00:10:50

00:10:55
MARC COHEN Bring your attention to the breath, riveting your attention on the sensation of the air as is it's being breathed in and the sensation of the air as it’s being breathed out. And say to yourself silently I accept myself unconditionally right now. Taking time for ourselves on a daily basis is not an option for health. It's a prerequisite for optimal health. Physical activity, vigorous physical activity for those who can get it is not a option for optimal health, it's a prerequisite for optimal health. And that balance of stillness and activity is a golden balance. Structured stillness on a regular basis is an absolute necessity. As we sit with stillness, we also get in touch with all of the crap that’s been accumulating over the day, the week, the month. And when we get in touch with that garbage that’s been accumulating the anger, the resentment, the sadness, the greed, the fear, that has had very little expression. We have the opportunity to release or transforming or both. Without taking that space for ourselves we rarely be able to get in touch with those subtle messages that our bodies are giving us and that our emotions are giving us and that our minds are giving us. We cannot let go of what we’re not aware of. We cannot change what we are not aware of. Mother Teresa has a wonderful quote about getting in touch with truth and she says only in silence can truth be heard. 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:15
GAIL HARRIS Let me ask you about solitude. Why is solitude important in creating time for yourself. 

00:13:20
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN The remarkable thing is that many of us don’t have much solitude. We have time when we are alone, might be alone at times working, we might be alone doing certain chores, we might be alone shopping. But time when nothing is going on and it is a… an opportunity to reflect on what’s happening in our lives. I think we don’t have enough time for this reflection. We are too caught in our mind. And I know in my life, I've often meet made decisions just basically somebody says what you want to do and quickly I have a response. And solitude allows us to slow things down so that I’m not just reacting with my mind, but I’m also reacting with my gut feeling. I’ve my whole alignment with what I’m doing. And too many of us still have the solitude and we fear solitude. And I believe that we only get a real comfort in life and we only begin to feel able to have this kind of time and we can sit alone and feel comfortable. 

00:14:20
GAIL HARRIS It takes some confidence to do that though doesn’t it? Because many people would described as being very selfish. Is there such a thing as I don’t know creative selfishness? 

00:14:25
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN Too many of us feel that we have this thing about being too selfish. But unfortunately what happens is in the prioritization of time, we put work first. We put spouse and family second. Third is everyday mundane chores. Fourth is social responsibilities and bottom on the list is us. And the problem like trickle-down theory is that if you don’t have any time nothing gets to the bottom and the most people I see are, are running on empty batteries. And the recharging this is time of solitude, the recharging of the battery comes from taking sometime for oneself. And it is not necessarily like a hermit solitude, this could be in the form of plaque and could be in form of exercise it could fun. But I think many of us need to be nourishing ourselves more because I think we have a lot more to give each other, if we are little more nourished within ourselves. 

00:15:25
GAIL HARRIS How did you figure this out? 

00:15:25
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN Well I figure this out because I found myself desperate for time. I found myself having grownup achievement oriented as so many of us in society and doing one project and then another and before I knew it I had three jobs and I was doing so many things and feeling the crisis that happen. Most of us live with their very strange equation called time is money. And the problem with time is money is we start to value our time related to how much money we are making for the time. What’s the efficiency of the use of our time. So if we are doing the dishes we think well I could also be talking on the telephone and watching the news all at the same time. So we start to be very good at multitasking and trying to juggle more and more balls. The problem with this is it to just to add to the stress load we have and there is an opportunity here in the everyday part of life to really experience sort of simple joys, the simple part of life. Too many of us look at that and we wanna fast forward ourselves through it. We wanna get on to the important stuff or the exciting stuff. We are not allowing ourselves to really enjoy our lives and then we are blaming it on the environment instead of realizing it's really us who needs to change. 

00:16:40
GAIL HARRIS You also talk about creating spontaneous time, which sounds like an absolute contradiction in terms if you are creating it how can it be spontaneous? 

00:16:45
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN It's sort of like a snow day Oh! A snow day and just life opens up to us and it’s like children, they are, they are ready to just whatever comes up. And I think too many of us have become adults and as adults we expect everything, we have everything planned. It's fine to have plans, but I know that some of the best experiences in my life have come when my plans have fallen through. 

00:17:10
GAIL HARRIS And what about creating time retreats? 

00:17:15
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN Well time retreats is an opportunity for people to slow down. Our lives are so stressed and busy that I like having a period of time where things really decompress. And I find the best ways in nature. If you can go for period of time and spend time in a very natural setting you start to find that your rhythm is shift. Our whole being, our heart, our spirit just has a new way of experiencing life. And I think too many of us are closed in, we are prisoners of time. And we need to be let go, we need, we need to breakout and be a little more free. So time retreats gives us an opportunity to look at our life's very carefully and decide which changes we want to make. Because trapped in the midst of everyday life you are caught. Time retreat opens a way of saying, “You know maybe I wanna make some changes." Maybe when I get back instead of always doing this, I’ll do it this way. 

00:18:05
GAIL HARRIS I was going to say you are not just talking about creating more time, you're really talking about being fully alive. 

00:18:10
STEPHAN RECHTSCHAFFEN It's absolutely right because really I equate time with the sense of what the soul is. See we're creating time here in what we call the moment. Instead of feeling rushed, we need to slow it down a little bit. And so when we shift that rhythm, we start to have a different experience o f aliveness. Now I like the aliveness of going fast sometimes, but a balance in life is to be able to go fast. And also when things slow down to go, “Ah this is nice,” to appreciate the full spectrum of life, that’s what we are talking about. 

00:18:45

00:18:50
GAIL HARRIS Being mindful can extend to everything you do, even something as seemingly routine as eating. We're gonna show you how in the next few minutes and if you like to join us all you need is a raisin. 

00:19:05
MARC COHEN Many of us eat in a very-very unconscious way and if we just bring little bit of attention to our eating we’ll notice how fast we eat. So we are gonna be experimenting today with a little technique of eating meditation. And we are going to be passing around few cups here with little objects in them that you’ll probably recognize. Just take one and don’t put it in your mouth. If you don’t like them the technique will be all the better. Everybody have one? May I ask you to put your raisin in your fingers. And before we get started at I would like you to just put your hands on your legs. Get into a comfortable meditation position and take a moment just to ground yourself in your breath, noticing the air as it's being breathed in through your nostrils and the air as it's being breathed out through your nostrils. 

00:20:20
[sil.] 

00:20:25
MARC COHEN Rivet your attention on your breath. And now take a moment to examine the raisin with your fingers as your eyes remain closed. Just notice the texture and the density of the raisin. As you gently move the raisin around in your fingers, bringing full attention to the sensation of the raisin against your fingertips. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:05
MARC COHEN And now bring the raisin up close to your eyes and examine it visually, noticing all of the traits and characteristics of the raisin and naming them. Now close your eyes again and bring the raisin up to your ear and move the raisin around in your fingers and listen carefully and make note of what you hear. Now bring the raisin to your nose… 

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:00
MARC COHEN …and notice the aroma of the raisin. Now bring the raisin down to your lips and just place the raisin on your lips for a moment without putting it in your mouth. Notice the taste on your lips. Now take the raisin and put it on your tongue, but don’t chew it. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
MARC COHEN Take one chew and the raisin back on the tongue and notice the sensation. Leave it on your tongue for a moment, split it set. And now slowly chew the raisin noticing every movement of your tongue and your teeth and the raisin. And whenever you’re ready, you can slowly swallow the remains of the raisin. I’ll read a very short passage from Thích Nhất Hạnh about eating. And he says that this food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends upon us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread or in a raisin. Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating and eating in mindfulness can bring us great happiness. 

00:24:15
GAIL HARRIS And that’s it for this edition of Body and Soul, we’re glad you could join us. I’m Gail Harris until next time be well.
