STEPHEN GILLIGAN , PhD 

00:00:35
STEVE GILLIGAN Okay, everybody. Hello. Good morning. Who is ready? Okay, usually we have a darkened theatre for these demos but I guess they're not videoing this umm… I think it's a regular workshop and I'm Steve Gilligan, this is Susan. If you want to identify your full family name, your social security number, or your address ID number, your past lives were in California but welcome, welcome. So we've got a little less than an hour to do some exploration of something that would come under the general rubric of what I call generative traps work and in the work that we're not interested in people sort of passing out or going into for just letting go but we're really interested in seeing what kind of creative conversation can occur when we begin to connect equally with these mines and this line at the same time we sort of use that as a as a basic guideline for a creative state. So good morning, Susan. 

00:02:10
SUSAN good morning. 

00:02:10
STEVE GILLIGAN How are you doing up here this morning. 

00:02:15
SUSAN A little nervous but good. 

00:02:20
STEVE GILLIGAN Any final requests led by Bob so maybe maybe do some helpful work here today and I want to umm… sincerely express my commitment to support you in the deepest possible ways that I can. So just as a starting point if there was one change one thing that could come out of our conversation that if it you know shifted in your world when you go back home you would say wow that's fantastic. What what might that be.. 

00:03:20
SUSAN That fear would be a less frequent visitor. 

00:03:25
STEVE GILLIGAN Great. And if fear was visiting less what do you think that would allow you to do that would be fantastic. If we could just get rid of this fear then I'd really rather be doing I really love to be experiencing achieving realizing. 

00:03:50
SUSAN I'd be more playful. I would be more at ease in my body. And and have more fun connecting. 

00:04:05
STEVE GILLIGAN And if there was one particular context the professionally or your relationship with others or just how you connect with yourself as you walk around which which of those contexts you think to most interesting to experience that chain. 

00:04:30
SUSAN I think connecting with myself because the more connected I am myself the easier it is to connect with others. 

00:04:35
STEVE GILLIGAN Right. So if we just close your eyes just for a moment and this is not formal traps or don't go on detracts. 

00:04:45
SUSAN Too late. 

00:04:45
STEVE GILLIGAN And you were to allow your imagination to lift one image in terms of what you would see yourself what you'd be doing in a week from now a month from now a year from now and just just be like to invite curiosity in terms of what colour image that you're creative consciousness. Might say How about this one. 

00:05:20
[sil.] 

00:05:30
STEVE GILLIGAN Take a moment and open your eyes again was that a two-part response. 

00:05:40
[sil.] 

00:05:45
SUSAN I… I had a lot of different images that some seamed together when you asked color I saw multiple colors and that one I got a shirt this summer that isn't typically mean that it's a white shirt with it all pastors of blues greens reds yellows and Sysav that. 

00:06:15
STEVE GILLIGAN "I hope it's okay for me to just say to all of those colors aka… aka thanks for joining our conversation pocket." What… what do you notice happening as I say that. 

00:06:35
SUSAN There's a relaxation in my body and I feel the smile on my face. 

00:06:45
STEVE GILLIGAN You better slow down you know that's the gateway experience it starts with the simple relaxation that a smile and in if I was noticing property and please let me know when when you touch that a second experience started to activate Is it true I didn't. Second experts you look kinda worried. 

00:07:20
SUSAN Oh, so the other thing that popped into my head was house that I tend to be very serious and I flashed on a memory of playing at the beach when I was young and making secure it with just the right amounts of different kinds of sand and there was a serious menace to it and so I was paused me I guess. 

00:07:50
STEVE GILLIGAN Interesting I just wanna share with you for what it's worth and I'm… I'm not suggesting anyway this is what's happening in new I'm just sort of noticing. My own experiential images I saw some some grandmothers something of a sudden come forward and there was this sort of older woman I looked really sad and really upset and this sort of carry it s whenever you start to go through that gateway of colors and relaxation and a smile just sort of curious. Who else begins to show up and whomever else does show up I would like to say to them equally and I'm sure it makes sense that you're coming into the conversation that this plan. So and what do you what do you notice there. 

00:09:10
[sil.] 

00:09:15
SUSAN So there's a resonance. My mom's 95. 

00:09:20
STEVE GILLIGAN Where in residence ready you fix my job. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
SUSAN That's the sense of sadness as feminists mostly for her. 

00:09:35
STEVE GILLIGAN You must be a therapist or so carrying that all the feelings interfere heavily. 

00:09:45
SUSAN So as I'm also noticing that it feels really good to have this resonance. 

00:09:55
STEVE GILLIGAN Now me to me to a with each of these additional presences that welcome it feels like something in me settled down and opens up and it comes much more rich and our connection so I thank you for sharing all those different presences and we've only just begun. So that sense of being happy and being able to see colors if I was to sort of again asks you to just ask the question inside how far into the future might be best to project that you were to think would be a week from now will be from now and part of why I would ask that at this point as you probably noticed that all these experiences are happening within the type container Susan and it's going to get pretty crowded there this space is just inside of her so to speak. So wherever there's a feeling of anxiety of being overwhelmed. One of the things that can be helpful as we sort of spatially open the mind body space and we begin to move the different what we might call the the players in the field who I want to be in the future. Who shows up when I go to do that how I had experienced different childhood memories we want to have a spaciousness so that all of those different presences. Have a place and still we have the space between. If you will. 

00:12:10
SUSAN So two responses popped up one was in a week and the other was right now. 

00:12:15
STEVE GILLIGAN Great. Nice to know that there's more than one truth per customer the rest of the country is going into fundamentalism. Okay sorry sorry just what you're starting to feel happy after this we'll do that at the end of the worksheet. So that that answer a one week from now and you made this moment where where did that come from if you were to just feel where it arose from was it as I want to point out you see the shoulders just got a little bit more tense which is interesting. 

00:13:05
SUSAN So when you ask where it came from it felt like it came from this side of me. 

00:13:10
STEVE GILLIGAN Isn't that great that your mind has so many different places and you have this little bit of that sorry if we're supposed to be treating anxiety. Now I see that you have tension in your shoulders where do you think that originates from so a week from now. 

00:13:45
[sil.] 

00:13:50
SUSAN It's too long. 

00:13:50
STEVE GILLIGAN So a week would it be okay to say a week from now and we want the world and we want it now. 

00:14:00
SUSAN How about three days sorry how about three days. 

00:14:05
STEVE GILLIGAN And if you were to me this is something that I do sometimes you might find it helpful to take that feeling of the colors and the happiness and just let your hands extended out into the wall seal that plays. Three days from now and feel almost like sending that image. So you begin to feel that it's already in the future. It's already in your future and as you each time that you do that that spaciousness. 

00:15:00
[sil.] 

00:15:05
STEVE GILLIGAN I don't know how that compares with the spaciousness or lack thereof that you had earlier in your life. Sounds like there wasn't a whole lot of spaciousness. 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:35
SUSAN And you say that I travel back to a night when I was walking down the street in a place called Heather hills to Solomon Island in the Milky Way was I felt so connected in the universe. 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:55
STEVE GILLIGAN I just wanna share for what it's worth but I experienced as you went into the space that you're sharing about right now is something really tightened in Pali kind of my Ivor side always looking at the depressing cynical sides of it and so that experience of being open to the Milky Way in lots of colors it's feeling. Over the next three days and I'm wondering what happens here as you tune to the positive future reality open more doesn't close as it gets warmer it gets colder. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:10
STEVE GILLIGAN Because that what happens here will determine whether you can sustainably. Open to that positive space and so if I have this sense of the way I want things to be and then I immediately locked down here or here that's going to create this sort of one to I want it it's not available to me and so this is the sort of the base that will determine whether these images positive images are able to become part of the mind-body integrity or so to do that. 

00:17:55
SUSAN So I didn't feel bad but I'm feeling into what you're saying and it feels almost like the action of the heart valve so there's an opening and shutting… shutting us. 

00:18:15
STEVE GILLIGAN Wherever you are in your process there's a sort of I want to open a need to clone. Yeah I'm going to open I need to clone. Open I need to close which do you think is more important I want to oh I need to be saying I wanna open I need to say I want to open I need to say in terms of your own your own capacity to mother you sow wonder what it would be if you were able to support both. Really want to open yet be color the way I need to clone a need protection. I need safety. I need to stay with me. Which do you think is more important. 

00:19:35
SUSAN Both right now. 

00:19:40
STEVE GILLIGAN So we'll try that process a little bit in terms of as a think about this process in the next three days. Feel that something like a vowel. In my organism is going to be doing this process of opening closing That's beautiful opening closing that's fantastic. That's opening. It's good colors coming back and feeling the milky way. Coming back feeling being at the beach comfortably closing. Come into play opening comfortably mothering. Beautiful organisms need to have its own rhythm that's correct and each time I can open in such a beautiful Happy way and I can close equally. Beautiful. Happy way and enjoy beauty courses something that's not so much in the head but it's in the cells. So I hope this isn't too personal question do you wear toenail Polish. 

00:21:50
SUSAN Yes. 

00:21:55
STEVE GILLIGAN I know this is our first session so and are you wearing toenail polished now and you don't have to answer that that's too may I ask what color. 

00:22:15
SUSAN Right now is a darker color, dark. 

00:22:15
STEVE GILLIGAN dark. 

00:22:20
SUSAN It's this green fall when when I'm in summer I wear lighter color. 

00:22:20
STEVE GILLIGAN Here in San Diego sister. 

00:22:25
SUSAN Never pedicure before I came. 

00:22:30
STEVE GILLIGAN So it's one of the things that I feel most jealous about with women I am from San Francisco but I said I I painted my toenails twice what one toe each time I was at a supervision that was a residential and therefore five women sitting around and they were painting their toenails said oh I'm so jealous and one of them took the polish it was purple and he said I don't know I never done this before but just try one toned down so did it but big toe is purple I went home my daughter who was then 14 looked and said, Dad, oh, god. I said, okay, I'll take it off. Second time she was 18 and I came over she said, oh, cool. She said, why do you just, do want. So in that process of opening and closing, what colors do you think your toenails might become and you might do this as an experiment to sort of ask is a sort of breath this fully that over the next days just be supporting my organism to opening. And when I open just notice what colors are in the toenails. And if the fingers saying, how about me? All right, you can go let them go and the fingers too. 

00:24:40
SUSAN So the first image that came as a different color in every toe. 

00:24:45
STEVE GILLIGAN Yeah, that's what I was saying. So is this too personal for you to share exactly which color. 

00:24:55
SUSAN I didn't go through the whole palette but I'm thinking of a powder blue and light green and orange and the pellet fade out in front of me and then whatever call to me I'll use. 

00:25:10
STEVE GILLIGAN That cool. So sincerely I would like to welcome those energies in your toenails. Sometimes when you go from the bottom up that conservative bring a deeper ground. A deeper rootedness and so by the time it reaches the upstairs. It can bring to those places that were carrying sadness or grief trauma from different generations you can begin to bring them the colors the sounds and very sort of subtle. Beautiful way. So that you can appreciate that in the playfulness appear beautiful precedence for the parts that had been so sad thinking there was no hope for them. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:35
SUSAN I've just flashing on my first job out of graduate school the clinic was right down the street from a department store and I went in at lunch one day and painted all my fingernails different colors and none of my clients noticed was kind of interesting but I had fun. So I but I love this invitation. 

00:27:00
STEVE GILLIGAN yeah yeah they're coming up on our viewer to look out into the group and see how it feels that maybe 100 people my god are noticing like what colors are fingernail toenails. 

00:27:20
SUSAN Yes, there was a little bit of a warning over here should be the same color and look and look and how in. 

00:27:30
STEVE GILLIGAN So a sense it was sort of almost like you were just feeling something role from one moment to the next moment to the next moment you see there these places where we sort of jump to the grand conclusions or what and whatever those are the points that the sort of the river gets down and just didn't invite the new four has a nice base to see if you can continue to track the colors sensation that roll through every part of your body. Each time your fingers move your eyes playing or you feel your feet on the ground and then I can think. An I can turn and I can feel I can remember and always stay in the moment. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:50
STEVE GILLIGAN Some days are better than others but it's nice that I'm I'm sorry or whatever happened you were not supported in doing that and I'm sorry for whatever is happening with your family members where they might have not been able to be present with you when I'm really happy to feel that you're here now and you've been on this long journey. Coming back home to open the gates of Jerusalem. Can be able to hear Oh I just had that thought what happened to the sensation in my feet what happened to the sensation what happens when I breathe through my body just in a very topping layer. So that whatever might happen in the outside world this is beautiful sound feeling that flow of color sensation and warm. That's Makes you part of the Milky Way. That Makes you part of every part of life to feel it's no longer about whether you're going to be playful or anxious. Something much more basic I'm here I'm here you'll know it by healing of sensation color. Yeah beautiful thing to feel that no matter who I'm thinking outside world that my connection to this inner feeling that flows much more basic much more basic so whether it's the Milky Way. Are seeing yourself in three days. Seeing yourself in five days maybe only as a peripheral implicit awareness something beautiful it's waiting for me five days seven days to we when you arrive at that plays in the future and say wow I got here without worrying. Even that word worry. and Feel what happens to the color how can I reclaim the color. How Can I feel into the temperature color so I'm going to come back to the word worry so much insight worry. Inside myself. Say that's interesting. That's interesting that's you find that something interesting and if I was to ask your inner being to bring an image of a month from now and again just to encourage you to be dedicated to the feeling in the feed to the feeling and the ankle. To the flow choose a day you can see every time that Susan thinks that she's disconnecting from her somatic beam and that's where basically you're just going to repeat the past. Every time the mind and the body split then the mind will only be capable of ending up at the same old same old. So to give the cognitive the freedom to really open beyond the habits of the past we need to feel the present moment and to do that we need to feel the body in some way and so that becomes our underbelly so to speak that becomes our way of being able to stay present even as we just allow the mind to do its thing but we can have that important detachment from watching how our mind works well in developing this affection for how your mind works out worries. Things out gets while boys now everything's going to change how it does its its dance so to speak. Always just needed some peasants to people. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:20
STEVE GILLIGAN You feel sadness come up or really better get back down to my toast Now this is an inside job starts from the top you can see that wave of sadness what's trying to come back to me that need some power and some healing. I don't want to give myself away to it I had to learn the hard way that doesn't help anybody want to open my own space. Feel the ankle bone is connected to the knee bone and the bone is and connected to the hip bone and yeah I think that was from a Donald Trump's speech. Everything is connected it's interconnected galactic time you open a space with laughter. Can open that space that I want to take it in to my base one and bring it home place inside of thought so the place before. So beautiful place deeper than my mind by just by that simple sensation, ten toes, how many colors, two ankles. How many temperatures, two calves and how many feelings of relaxation. And as you breathe it all the way up, all the way up to the top of your head, you feel up above some beautiful healing energy and then breathing out and letting that energy just give you a beautiful shower of relaxation, shower through your eyeballs, through your shoulders. And as you feel that you're part of the Milky Way, you know, you're relaxed enough and also spacious. So that each different presence can come. Welcome, hi, and then each can go. 

00:39:50
[sil.] 

00:40:00
STEVE GILLIGAN It's nice to see Milton Erickson used to say to me it's never too late to enjoy a happy second childhood. Nice to swear under my breath. No no way. Man there's no way I'm going back it took a far better hypnotist my three-year-old daughter. Say Daddy and it's never too late to learn the simple pleasures safely feeling in your body that the space inside and open and then like a bow. So I need to provide to safety. Beautiful energy blanket. Sort of a second scan that you can see people outside seconds can you find your unconscious mind sometimes makes them smaller. Sometimes makes them more distant sometimes brings them close enough so that you can feel the connection. Without losing yourself you're able to say as life. Great or why is great. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:10
STEVE GILLIGAN The Buddhists like to say that you've got you and you get a human life you have hit the jackpot infinite possibilities and the caveat is we have to learn how to create a space for ourselves to be safe and to be free. I'm… I'm sorry that… that didn't happen for you. By the people who were supposed to. I'm sorry that it's been hard as a result. I'm really happy to see that you're here now. Learning that in order to stay playful. Stay comfortable stay relaxed. So bringing myself through my cell the closest thing to you is you how long have you been a therapist. 

00:43:35
[sil.] 

00:43:40
SUSAN 40 years since 77. 

00:43:45
STEVE GILLIGAN What's the best thing that you have appreciated about being a therapist? 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:43:55
SUSAN Do I have to pick one? I love the connection that I feel when I sit with someone and I love the grace in watching people emerge and heal. 

00:44:15
[sil.] 

00:44:25
STEVE GILLIGAN I do too. I do too. So isn't it nice that you have this challenging long-term client now? 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:40
SUSAN Oh, I love that reframe. Yes. 

00:44:45
STEVE GILLIGAN And what sort of commitment do you find it important to make to your client. So that they know that they can count on you. 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:10
SUSAN I'm struggling a little bit because I feel like the commitment is already there to be present and to continue to be accepting and compassionate. Which is not always my default given my mother and my grandmother. 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:35
STEVE GILLIGAN So we called in the clouds and if that sounds too that rolling thunder stuff up your day I'm sincere. Because you figure. Multiple times every day you'll find those old hypnotic relationships. Returning just the part of your identity matrix and what we're really exploring today is that whatever Does come I will be here with me we're translating that into just a thought but something that begins to create the basis for the space for thought and feeling truly beautiful town shooting. 

00:46:40
SUSAN You can't see but I'm wiggling my toes and there is an aliveness that's coming up from the towers in the base of my feet the body. 

00:46:55
STEVE GILLIGAN thanks for sharing. 

00:46:55
SUSAN They say welcome. 

00:47:00
STEVE GILLIGAN So I think that's a that's a good place that we'd might style. Three. Hope it's okay that got a lot of therapy from you. Seriously I mean that's my challenge to learning how to connect with my cell before I allow myself to really open to anybody else. Knowing that's really my only hope to not only feel my own happiness but to actually be helpful to others in the life that I wanted. 

00:47:50
SUSAN So that moved me deeply. Namaste. 

00:47:55
STEVE GILLIGAN Namaste, namaste. Okay, so we'll stop there and thank you join me in thanking Susan. 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:10
STEVE GILLIGAN You stay there because we have a couple of minutes I would just like to open it first Anybody I hope that you got some therapy. Out of the work and by the way I mean that very sincerely. Because I think it's really important for us but really important for our clients. People get better when they can be able to help others and so this traditional therapeutic stat. Of I'm not here for me it's all about you I think robs the client of being able to give a therapeutic gift to others including therapist. Which is really detrimental to their development and growth. So I'm really looking for throughout the session. Any moments where the Spirit shines and that's not only beauty but you see the pain and suffering and the person's resilience and to drink that in and when you drink it in you are beginning to shift the mind from an isolated individual to the power of two and I think it was Donald Trump who sets. Wherever two or more are gathered in my name that's where all the Wasn't that President Trump. I okay so if anybody has any comments that they would just like to personally share with Susan with that be Okay the microphone is up here. 

00:50:00
[sil.] 

00:50:05
STEVE GILLIGAN You can share your name. 

00:50:10
WAYNE Susie, I'm Wayne and I was right upfront watching the whole thing and I really really appreciated watching your your hands your feet are really your feet it's started and it was just really beautiful to see your feet ground themselves slim and then your hands relaxed as they are now and it shoulders went down I was just watching. Not only but your body language and I feel like it was very effective therapy. Just by watching that Thank you. 

00:50:50
SUSAN Thank you. 

00:50:50
STEVE GILLIGAN Thank you. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:51:05
STEVE GILLIGAN These conferences really inspire deep personal sharing the physical environment that great such warm. Okay do you have any professional questions about the treatment of anxiety I do want to say that all these chronic conditions there is this shared sense of I'm no longer in the present moment and in particular in things like anxiety you see there is a lifting of the center up and the shoes that he caught from here up then it's trying to person is trying to move it away and I know from studying Aikido For many years if you really want to be able to move somebody. First thing is to lift their center on and then they no longer have any say in the matter and so this sense of being able to find your center to feel the dropping of the key. They talk about Gong The dropping qi is really really important antidote to anxiety and that's why I was talking about let's start with the toes. That's focused on sensation because again in anxiety. There is a loss of sensation. We're in this sort of one step removed from any sort of experiential process so the the starting down below. Bringing things like color temperature and sensation is there to reactivate the experiential resources of the present moment that's one things can actually change and then to do that was saying that careful tracking as a learned process that to say it's one we have a break in the continuity of moment to moment to moment that's when we dissociate and disconnect and that's where the old negative habits of the symptom automatically play out So if we're staying in sensory connection from moment to moment to moment we have what the music the musicians call it tight enough connection. So you can't you can't get into too much trouble. It's what we're trying to do with our therapeutic present. We're trying to bring this relational present so as the person experiences things that they're able to just disconnect over and over were saying Stay here stay with me stay with… with this connection back and forth and then we're looking to move it on the vertical axis. Really seeing if we can stay in the present sensation from moment to moment to moment. Once you do that it's… it's not difficult to see when a person breaks and this will happen multiple times in every session particularly if you notice when I think what was the word I said anxiety or sadness. Remember it's about two-thirds. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Fear. 

00:54:55
STEVE GILLIGAN Now wasn't fear. Anyway I said some word and that lot that Susan was teaching me in the first ten minutes when I go into my problem state either I have this face you know my head goes up I looked sort of sad worried and my stomach stop starts breathing here that that is the q that I'm going into problem land. I'm going into ghost the ghost world where nothing ever changes I'm waiting for good all right. So we're really trying to track each moment to moment to moment to see in each moment are you staying connected to your resources to your positive intention to your somatic presence to the relational connection because that's where change was spontaneously begin to happen doesn't mean only spontaneous spontaneous as of now but there's a flow that begins to happen that if you then harmonize with it enjoying it you can begin to elaborate into something that actually takes root in the wall but as soon as the mind and the body lose their unity. All bets are off at that point you are just using these routinized habitual sequences that are not in the present moment and if you're not in the present moment you have no feedback you have no way to put yourself out beyond yourself which is what we need to change we have to say here's where I am and I lift my self into the wall and then I receive the world back into me and then I'm just feeling from moment to moment to moment I have to stay adjusting to connection as soon as the person loses connection. Nothing creative can happen okay so what we were doing this session was one example and again the notion of focusing upon the bottom up and on sensation and… and watching how she looked when she was doing that and then noticing how she looked when she would go into her worries state and quickly I think you have three to five seconds to be able to jump in and have the person will back to reconnection as the weight to begin to build all alternate conditioning alternate conditioning they alternate condition is when I think of my mom I feel sadness and that I feel since colors in my toes and the colors of my toes start bringing me through this process. So we're not we can never get rid of these negative habituated conditionings but we can begin to develop alternate pathways so to speak but it takes in an experiential mind-body state that is in the present moment and then moving through it over and over and over again for it to begin to happen. So just as a closing anything you want to say about that or anything else in terms of your sort of joining us back now in terms of your professional self and as a member of our our our professional community here.

SUSAN I loved working with you and I was in a very different state than I normally am because I was just following and taking in what you are offering in coming into myself at the same time which was really beautiful and the other thing that you want to see me too which is I think the other thing that I love about being a therapist is how I keep getting healed by the work that the people that I work with that so I'm very grateful.
