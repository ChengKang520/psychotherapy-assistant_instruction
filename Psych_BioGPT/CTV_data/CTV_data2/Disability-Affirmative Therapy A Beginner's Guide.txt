DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY A Beginners Guide 

00:00:00
DR. RHODA OLKIN  Hi, I'm Professor Rhoda Olkin, the author of "What Psychotherapists Should Know About Disability," in which I discuss what I call Disability-Affirmative Therapy. 

00:00:15
(1999). NY: GUILFORD PRESS 

00:00:15
DR. RHODA OLKIN  This training video is aimed at therapists who might not have much experience in working with clients with disabilities, and those who would like to increase their skills in this area. The video is going to show three examples of initial sessions with clients with disabilities. Two of the clients have the same disability, cerebral palsy, but very different levels of impairment. The third client is blind and uses a guide dog. These client interactions show some critical points in an initial session, such as introductions, asking about the disability, and understanding how disability relates to the presenting problem. Disability-Affirmative Therapy, the first session. Why focus on the first session? Because events and interaction between a therapist and a client that occur in the first session can reverberate throughout the therapy. Early mistakes can interfere with and even prevent a therapeutic relationship from ever getting off the ground. We'll see this in one of the examples. Imagine a typical initial session with a new client. Several things are typical in a new session. Let's consider five typical events of a first session. One, the client opens the door to the waiting room. Two, the therapist goes out to meet the client, and they shake hands. Three, they go into the therapy room, where there are a choice of seats. Four, there may be an intake, HIPAA or consent form to fill out. Five, therapy often begins with an open-ended question, such as, "What brings you here today?" These are a few of the initial events that happen very quickly in a first session in the first few minutes with a new client. However, for the client with a disability each of these events may impose barriers. Let's look at them from a disability perspective. As we do, keep in mind an important point. It's not that there is a right or wrong way to do each of these things; there are many right ways, and many wrong ways, but what makes them right or wrong is not some list of guidelines, but rather how they are perceived by a particular client. What makes something "right" or "wrong" is how it works or doesn't work for that client. The client opens the door to the waiting room. How can something so seemingly simple be complicated by disability? Let's take some examples. For a woman with multiple sclerosis with limited hand strength, opening a door may be difficult. If the therapist leaves the client to open it herself, the client may think the therapist is uncaring and feel resentful. If the therapist goes to open the door the client may feel patronized. Again, we see that the issue is not "Should I open the door or shouldn't I open the door?" The issue is that the therapist must be aware of how opening a door or not opening a door has different meaning for people with disabilities than people without disabilities, and for one person with a disability versus another person with a disability. Let's continue with our example. The therapist goes out to greet the client and they shake hands. Well, this is interesting. It is not normative in the disability community to shake hands, because for us shaking hands can be problematic. A person with a visual impairment may not see your extended hand, a person with cerebral palsy may not have hand coordination, a person on crutches may not have a free hand, and a person with arthritis may, may experience pain upon shaking hands. So within the disability community we might not shake hands. But some clients with disabilities may think that your not shaking their hand is a sign that you think they are "untouchable" because of the disability. This is a common reaction that people with disabilities encounter. Again we see a simple act of, such as shaking hands takes on different meanings for people with disabilities. And again I want to stress that there is no right or wrong way, no absolutes such as always shake hands or never shake hands, but rather there needs to be an awareness of how shaking hands carries meaning about disability sensitivity to the client. In a similar way, you will be making choices as the session starts. These choices might include whether to ask a man in a wheelchair whether he would like to transfer to a seat, to offer a large print copy of your intake form, to offer to read material out loud. Each of these acts and how you do them conveys messages to the client about your comfort level with people with disabilities. Like other minority clients, clients with disabilities may be very sensitive to cues about the therapist's reaction to disability. Disability-Affirmative Therapy, talking about disability. Many people, not just clinicians, are reluctant to bring up disability. We've been taught that it's impolite. But of course therapists bring up many topics that are not typical of casual conversation, such as sexual abuse, alcohol or drug abuse, suicide. And often we find that clients are relieved when we've raised these topics, and by talking about them therapists demonstrate that therapy is a place where the conversation is different. Yet even forthright therapists may feel reluctant to bring up disability. This is true for several reasons. Quite simply they don't have any experience talking about disability. They may feel uncomfortable with disability, and be afraid to say something for fear that it will show their discomfort. They wish not to offend the client by making the disability more salient than it already is. They worry about being politically correct, and don't know what language to use and worry about offending the client. But whatever the reason for the discomfort, the therapist will need to become much more at ease talking about disability. If the therapist remains uncomfortable, it is likely that this discomfort will be displayed to the client in subtle yet perceptible ways. Remember, clients with disabilities are used to subtle cues about how people respond to their disability. The therapist who is at ease about disability will help the client to feel safe to explore in therapy. Let's look at examples of three different clients in the first session. In this first example, the therapist goes through her usual intake procedures, asking all of the routine questions. Initial intake: Nicole and Alette

00:07:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Okay, if you could just tell me I have an intake form uhm, ah, that I usually have people fill out. Would you like to fill it out or would you like me to assist you? 

00:07:50
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Actually, if you could assist me that would be great. 

00:07:55
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Okay, well for starters if you could just tell me what brought you here today? 

00:08:00
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Well, I'm a new mom and just a little overwhelmed with all this scheduling... (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Hmm. 

00:08:15
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  and hiring people to help me help with the baby and really setting limits with the childcare provider. So that they know I'm the mother and not them. 

00:08:45
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Okay. You said something about overwhelmed with the scheduling and hiring for assistance and then you said something prior to uhm, "so that they know that you're the mom and they're assisting you. What was that? I'm sorry I didn't understand you. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  Setting the appropriate boundaries. 

00:09:05
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Okay, we'll go back to that. I just want to go ahead and finish filling out the form. Have you had previous therapy before?

00:11:30
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Yes! 

00:11:30
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Yes? Okay. We'll come back to that. 

00:11:35
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Have you recently experienced a significant loss? 

00:11:35
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  Yeah. 

00:11:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Yes. Okay. Uhm, who? 

00:11:40
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  Uhm, a dear family friend passed away a week ago today. 

00:11:50
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Oh, I'm sorry. Was it something that was expected or, or something that was not expected? 

00:11:55
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Hmm, very unexpected. 

00:12:00
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Now that we've covered some of the basic intake questions, and have a little bit of history, why don't you tell me why you're here specifically today? So you're a new mom? How old? 

00:12:10
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Eleven months. 

00:12:10
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Are you a single mom or are you married or do you have a partner? 

00:12:15
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  Married mom. 

00:12:20
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Okay. And how long have you been married? 

00:12:25
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Almost five years. 

00:12:25
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Congratulations! Okay, now you said you were overwhelmed with all of the scheduling and hiring for assistants. Is that primarily... (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Hmm. 

00:12:35
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES ...what you're doing? Or are you doing it as a couple? (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Uh hmm. No, I do all the hiring, (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Okay. 

00:12:40
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  training, supervising, firing, et cetera. Plus I have two jobs. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES What(ph)? 

00:13:00
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE I'm working full-time on top of that job. I work with teenagers in residential treatment. 

00:13:15
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES So you're saying that you have to do the hiring, the training, the supervising and the firing of assistants, plus you have two jobs and you work full-time. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Well, that seems very overwhelming. Uhm, so what would you like to work on specifically here? What are your goals to work on here? 

00:13:35
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Well, I recently had an experience where I had to fire someone because they weren't doing, well, two reasons. She wasn't doing her job the right way and she broke confidentiality, which I take very seriously. I have since hired new people... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE ...and my problem with that when I hired the first batch of assistants, I was on maternity leave so I could. (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES I'm sorry, wait a minute, could you go back, I didn't understand. 

00:14:40
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Ah, sure. I was on maternity... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Oh! 

00:14:45
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE ...leave... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE ...so I was home full-time... (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  and I could really train the individuals. Now I'm back to work and that my ability to train them is impossible. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE And nobody thinks that like, when I am home and the baby starts crying. I don't want them to engage with the child. I want them to bring my daughter to me. Ah, basically, they need to be my hands but, and let me take care of her emotional needs. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Oh, then(ph)p. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Just, so, it's just frustrating that they're not listening to my requests and I'm not sure it's how I'm telling them. I write it down but it's not getting across and I think part of it is you know when I'm not home... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  they do have to attend to her needs. So when I come home, they have to switch roles too. 

00:16:55
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Uh-huh. 

00:16:55
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Does that make sense? 

00:17:00
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES I believe so. So, when you're not at home, when you're at work, they're supposed to take care of the child but when you're home, you want them to be your hands and you want them to bring the child for, to you for, and you can emotionally comfort your child. 

00:17:10
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE  Exactly. 

00:17:15
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Okay. And that's not happening? 

00:17:15
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Not without having to constantly remind them. 

00:17:25
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Uh-huh. 

00:17:25
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE And just so overwhelmed with everything else, that after two months they should know the routine. 

00:17:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Oh, it's been two months. 

00:17:40
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Yeah. 

00:17:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Oh, I see. 

00:17:45
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Yeah. 

00:17:45
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES So, you mentioned that you're having problems with certain assistants. How many assistants do you have? 

00:17:50
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE I currently have five assistants. 

00:17:55
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Five. What do you think about the idea of maybe having an assistant or some of your assistants actually come in with you? 

00:18:05
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE You know that's a definite possibility. It might help to have a third party perspective. 

00:18:15
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Okay, why don't you give that some thought if that would be helpful for you. 

00:18:20
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY Dr. Rhoda Olkin 

00:18:20
DR. RHODA OLKIN  Let's consider what worked between this therapist and this client. First, the therapist gets right down to business, seemingly finding the disability fairly inconsequential for the task at hand. This conveys that the disability is not so prominent that it will overshadow other tasks. Second, the therapist offers a choice of two accommodations, asking whether Alette would like to fill out the intake form herself or have the therapist assist her. This keeps control with the client who is most knowledgeable about her own needs, and conveys sensitivity on the part of the therapist. Third, as the client begins to tell her story of why she's coming to therapy the speech involvement in her cerebral palsy sometimes makes it hard to understand her. The therapist seems natural and at ease in asking the client to repeat something she didn't catch. This small act is enormously important, as it communicates to the client that the therapist is listening carefully and wants to understand her, both literally and figuratively. Fourth, by asking all the routine questions, without deciding to omit any, the therapist doesn't make any preconceived notions about people with disabilities and doesn't allow that to distort the intake process. And in fact we learn that Alette, a woman with a significant disability, has a job, is married, and has a baby. When Alette shares the reason for seeking therapy, it turns out that it is quite disability related. She is having trouble getting the kind of assistance that she'd like in the home. When she's at work her assistants interact with the baby, comfort, soothe and feed the baby but when Alette is home, she would like to be quite naturally in the mother role and she needs the assistants to bring the baby to her for these activities. The therapist conveys flexibility in raising the question of whether it would be helpful to have any of the assistants join Alette in the therapy. But she leaves this up to the client, again, respecting her choice. Let's look at how the session ends. 

00:20:40
SESSION END Nicole and Alette 

00:20:40
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Okay. Is there anything that, before we come to a close, is there anything that may have made the session more comfortable for you? 

00:20:50
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Actually, it was very comfortable. I did not see the bathroom? Is it accessible? 

00:21:00
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES  Yes, I believe it's accessible. You're gonna go straight down the hallway and to your right, It's ah, has swing doors. It has grab bars and there is room enough in the stall for a front or side transfer. 

00:21:15
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Okay. That's great. One thing, I left my assistant in the car this time. In the future is there a place that she could wait inside? 

00:21:35
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES Definitely, she's more than welcome to wait right here in the outside waiting room. Uhm, otherwise, there's a coffee shop right across the street if that would be better. 

00:21:45
ALETTE COBLE-TEMPLE Thank you. 

00:21:45
NICOLE GALBERTH-AVILES You're so welcome. 

00:21:45
DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY Dr. Rhoda Olkin 

00:21:45
DR. RHODA OLKIN  In this last portion of the session the therapist continues to show disability comfort. When asked about accessibility of the bathroom, instead of answering, "Yes, it's accessible," she responds with specific information that allows the client to understand for herself whether it would be accessible for her. Thus, this session started well and ended well, and we have every reason to expect that it will continue to work between this client and this therapist. Now let's look at a second example. This therapist makes many mistakes. See if you can spot them as you watch the video. Initial intake, Dr. Vedha and Heidi. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:35
DR. VEDHA  Hi Heidi. I'm, I'm Dr. Vedha. 

00:23:05
HEIDI JOSHI Hi. It's nice to meet you. 

00:23:05
DR. VEDHA It's nice to meet you. And who is this? Hi! 

00:23:10
HEIDI JOSHI I'm sorry... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
DR. VEDHA How are you? 

00:23:10
HEIDI JOSHI ...you can't pet him. He's working right now. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
DR. VEDHA I, oh, I, I can't pet you right now but you're very sweet and you are allowed here because you are a guide dog. I can see that. Oh, and you have the sign too, "Do not pet me I'm working." That's very clever. That's very clever. Hello, uhm, Heidi, it's good to have you here. My office is in the back here, ah, Heidi, uhm. 

00:23:35
HEIDI JOSHI Okay. 

00:23:35
DR. VEDHA Do you want me to take, to lead the dog, should I take the, the dog... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
HEIDI JOSHI No, I can just take your arm. 

00:23:40
DR. VEDHA ...and lead you forward(ph), if it's all right with you. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
HEIDI JOSHI I'm just. 

00:23:40
DR. VEDHA And so I'll just take, take you in. Uhm, we're just gonna go, the door's kind of narrow here. That's great. Uhm, and the chair. (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
HEIDI JOSHI I can just, I can just take your arm if you'd, if that would be easier. 

00:23:50
DR. VEDHA Okay. Okay, that's fine. That's totally fine. That's good. And ah, we're gonna have you sit here. Now where does the dog sit? 

00:24:05
HEIDI JOSHI Oh, he'll just sit at my feet. I'll be fine. I can put him there. 

00:24:05
DR. VEDHA Okay. So, I'll just let you be in charge of that then. 

00:24:10
HEIDI JOSHI That would be great. 

00:24:10
DR. VEDHA Okay. That's great. 

00:24:10
HEIDI JOSHI  Sit. Down. Down. 

00:24:15
DR. VEDHA  All right. 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:25
DR. VEDHA  Sorry, I forgot to close the door there. Uhm, ah. So, Heidi, what brings you here today? 

00:24:45
HEIDI JOSHI Well, I guess I'm just feeling really anxious and a little bit overwhelmed. I'm having some trouble with my marriage and I think that, you know, work is getting really tough, too. I, (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
DR. VEDHA Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
HEIDI JOSHI I'm finding myself really, just feeling like I don't have time for anything or anyone and I think it's just the stress of, I don't know, everything is just building up. 

00:25:10
DR. VEDHA And uhm, how long have you been feeling this way? 

00:25:15
HEIDI JOSHI Well, I think ever since my husband and I started having a lot more difficulties. You know, it seems like everything has been sort of adding on top of that. You know that seems to be the biggest part. We've really, we haven't been talking to each other very much and, you know, we just, we don't even eat dinner together anymore. 

00:25:35
DR. VEDHA Okay. And, how long have you been married? 

00:25:35
HEIDI JOSHI  Uhm, maybe about a year and a half. 

00:25:40
DR. VEDHA Okay. And uhm, what was your husband's disability? 

00:25:45
HEIDI JOSHI Oh, he, he doesn't have a disability. 

00:25:50
DR. VEDHA Uhm, Oh! Uhm, uhm, how long did you say it was? 

00:25:55
HEIDI JOSHI Oh, about a year and a half. 

00:25:55
DR. VEDHA Year, year and a half. 

00:25:55
HEIDI JOSHI  Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
DR. VEDHA And ah, he doesn't have a disability. Uhm, so how did you and your husband meet? 

00:26:10
HEIDI JOSHI Oh, well, we met in college actually. 

00:26:10
DR. VEDHA  Uhm, and did you have the, the dog then? 

00:26:15
HEIDI JOSHI  I'm sorry? 

00:26:20
DR. VEDHA Uhm. (clears throat) Did you have the dog when you met your husband? 

00:26:25
HEIDI JOSHI Uhm, I had a different dog then. But I had a dog, yes. 

00:26:30
DR. VEDHA Oh, what, what happened to that dog? 

00:26:35
HEIDI JOSHI Ah, I'm sorry, I'm really confused. 

00:26:40
DR. VEDHA Well, let's, let's go back to the anxiety piece ah, just for a moment. 

00:26:45
HEIDI JOSHI That would be great. 

00:26:45
DR. VEDHA So, have you had, uhm, therapy before? 

00:26:50
HEIDI JOSHI No. This is my first time. 

00:26:50
DR. VEDHA Okay, so this is your first experience. 

00:26:50
HEIDI JOSHI  Yes. 

00:26:55
DR. VEDHA Uhm, well, I think what we might do in the next section is, have you, have you ever had a, a Burns, ah, Anxiety Inventory done before? 

00:27:05
HEIDI JOSHI No, I've never done that before. 

00:27:05
DR. VEDHA Oh, yeah. Uhm, well, how would we do that? Well, you know, what I would probably do is I would read that to you and uhm, yeah, that, that would work just fine and ah, uhm, then I could record, record it and ah, explain to you what the outcome was of that inventory. 

00:27:25
HEIDI JOSHI You're, is that normally how it's done? 

00:27:30
DR. VEDHA Well, uhm, normally what I would do is I would give it to you and you would circle numbers and that kind of thing but that, that obviously won't, won't (laugh) won't work for us, uhm, as we are now, but that's all right. Uhm, you know, we'll work it out. We'll make it work. 

00:27:45
HEIDI JOSHI  Okay. Well, I, it just seems to me that, you know, there might be some other ways to do it, but if, you know, yeah, we could do that if you want. 

00:27:55
DR. VEDHA Well, you know more about this kind of thing than I do, uhm, you could give me your suggestions, you know, on how, on how it would best be done. Let's, let's change gears for a bit and, and talk again about your marriage... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
HEIDI JOSHI Okay. 

00:28:10
DR. VEDHA ...and these anxiety issues. I'm just curious to know uhm, what brings your anxiety uhm, within your marriage? 

00:28:20
HEIDI JOSHI Well, I just think it's that the fact that we don't really talk anymore and it seems like we're ah, kind of on a different page all the time. 

00:28:25
DR. VEDHA  Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
HEIDI JOSHI Yeah, I, I definitely think that we, we're just not connecting like we did, you know, even six months ago. 

00:28:35
DR. VEDHA  Have you and your husband ever tried couple's therapy? 

00:28:40
HEIDI JOSHI Uhm, No, I thought I would try this first, you know, just to see if, how it was and I don't think my husband is really into therapy very much so I thought I would, I would come first and then see how it is and see if I can get some help for myself first. 

00:28:55
DR. VEDHA  Is he okay? 

00:29:00
HEIDI JOSHI Fine. 

00:29:00
DR. VEDHA I just, ah, his legs are shaking and I didn't know if, if he was all right. 

00:29:05
HEIDI JOSHI Oh, you mean the dog? 

00:29:05
DR. VEDHA  Yeah. 

00:29:10
HEIDI JOSHI Oh, he's, he's fine. He's just sleeping. 

00:29:10
DR. VEDHA Okay. 

00:29:10
HEIDI JOSHI He's just dreaming. 

00:29:10
DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY Dr. Rhoda Olkin 

00:29:10
DR. RHODA OLKIN  Let's list the missteps this therapist took. If you'd like, pause the video now and make a list for comparison. Here are the main mistakes. The therapist immediately focuses on the dog when the dog is working, and the client has to correct him. Even though she got herself to the office, the therapist has no clue about this client's independence, and offers to lead her to his office, and feels the need to describe everything to her. Once in the office, the therapist is still fussing about the dog, as if the client has never done this before. He says, "I'll just let you be in charge of that then," which is very patronizing, of course she's in charge of her guide dog. The therapist then seems to get on track, asking about what brings Heidi to therapy, how long she's been feeling this way, and how long she's been married. But clearly her disability is still very much on his mind, and he makes the assumption that a non-disabled person would not marry a blind woman. This unconscious slip conveys his own prejudices about disability, and probably is the beginning of the end for this therapy. Heidi's unexpected answer that her husband does not have a disability seems to unnerve him, and he becomes what has been called "deskilled." Deskilled is when a therapist seems to forget his training and experience in the face of his responses to the client. The term was first used to describe what often happens to hearing therapists when faced with a deaf client. As this therapist becomes deskilled his unconscious seems to get stronger and he again focuses on the dog, and it takes Heidi saying she's confused before he switches back to the task at hand, finding out about her presenting problem. When Heidi brings up her anxiety, the therapist, in his own mind, leaps ahead several steps to an anxiety inventory he might want to use, and then he realizes quickly that a written inventory will require accommodations. But unlike Nicole, the therapist in the first vignette, he is not graceful in how he discusses accommodations. Furthermore, he expects Heidi to have knowledge that a client may not have; he says, "Well you know more about this kind of thing than I do." This is a tricky issue in therapy with clients with disabilities, namely letting the client retain self-determination and being the expert on his or her own disability, without having a role reversal where the client is expected to take charge of portions of the therapy. Although the therapist seems to get back on track and asks more about the marriage, he again abruptly is distracted by the dog when the dog's legs twitch in the dog's sleep. This is a verbal sign to the client that the therapist has been monitoring the dog instead of her, which would tend to make any client feel dismissed. Given all these mistakes, let's see what happens at the end of the session. 

00:32:30
SESSION END Dr. Vedha and Heidi 

00:32:30
DR. VEDHA  Well, I see that we are just about at ah, five minutes here and uhm, you know, what I normally do at the end of the session is just kinda do a check-in and see how things were for you. So uhm, and how was this for you? I, I just want to say that I'm, I'm very impressed ah, that you got here, uhm, that you were on time. A lot of my clients are not on time and I just think it's really commendable that you were, that you, uhm, made it. It's a very complex area to, to get around and I totally understand that and I just really think that it's, it's commendable that you're here. Uhm, and I just want to know does this, does this feel like a good fit for you? Ah, are you feeling like we're going to be able to work on some of the things that you need to work on, uhm, together? 

00:33:25
HEIDI JOSHI Well, I, I don't know. I mean, yeah, this is, this is my first time and I've never done this before but, honestly, I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything but it just, just felt a little awkward. 

00:33:40
DR. VEDHA Now, how was it awkward? 

00:33:40
HEIDI JOSHI Well, I mean, just some of the questions didn't really feel like they had a lot to do with, you know, my stuff going on in my marriage and stuff, I don't know. It just felt kind of strange and like something wasn't really comfortable. 

00:33:55
DR. VEDHA  Uhm, was this around issues of your, your blindness, Heidi? 

00:34:00
HEIDI JOSHI Well, I mean, I don't know if that's, you know, I don't really know if that's what it was, but maybe, I don't know. 

00:34:05
DR. VEDHA  Well you know, therapy is uhm, a relationship and I would really like to learn more about how to interact with, with your blindness. Uhm, It's something which, which I do feel comfortable with, uhm, and in, in fact I even have some experience with that. When I was in fifth grade I had a friend who was blind, he was being mainstreamed and he even taught me a little bit of Braille, and(ph) it was a lot of fun. And, and he taught me a lot of respect ah, for people. But I realize that I, I don't know uhm, as much as I could and I would really like to learn more from you and, you know, I, I would like to know, you know, what you could teach me, uhm, that could help me to, to be a better ah, help to you in, in our time together. 

00:35:05
HEIDI JOSHI I guess, you know, I'm just not, I'm just not sure that that's all. I guess I'd want you to feel comfortable, but I, I'd really want to talk more about, you know, my marital stuff and anxiety. 

00:35:20
DR. VEDHA  But we really only have a couple minutes now, Heidi but today we have talked about a number of important issues. We've talked about your anxiety, ah, how that pertains to your marriage and, boy, I'd really like to make this work, especially ah, the piece around the anxiety inventory. Uhm, do you read Braille, Heidi? 

00:35:45
HEIDI JOSHI Yeah, I read Braille. 

00:35:50
DR. VEDHA Okay, well, we could probably put it into, into Braille for you, uhm, it might take us a little bit of time. I think it would be good for us over the next ah, weeks to hear some more about your anxiety and to come up with a treatment plan around that piece. I'd really like to know what you would like to get out of this ah, therapy and why you're here. 

00:36:15
HEIDI JOSHI I just wanted to get better, you know. 

00:36:20
DR. VEDHA Tzk. Well, I'm afraid that we are just about out of time ah, Heidi. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
HEIDI JOSHI Okay. 

00:36:25
DR. VEDHA  It was, it was good to have, good to have you here and, ah, how can I help you, do you need, do you need help to get out to the door here? 

00:36:35
HEIDI JOSHI  Oh, no, I think I'll be fine, thank you. 

00:36:40
DR. VEDHA Just to let you know, as you are going around uhm, the door's gonna be on your left. The door knob is on the left side of the door. Ah, as you open it up you're going to be going into another room. My desk is on the right. Uhm, you're gonna watch that as an obstacle. I think I left the other door open. You're gonna go into the hall, turn right, go down and when you hear the uhm, Coke machine, you're going to go past that and make your way out the front door. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
HEIDI JOSHI Okay. Thank you very much. 

00:37:05
DR. VEDHA And then ah, Yeah, I'm sure you'll, you'll be, you'll be fine. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
HEIDI JOSHI Yes, thank you. 

00:37:10
DR. VEDHA Just come back if you have any, any issues or it's good having you here. It's nice, nice to meet you. 

00:37:15
HEIDI JOSHI Thank you and nice to meet you. 

00:37:15
DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY Dr. Rhoda Olkin 

00:37:15
DR. RHODA OLKIN  Well, it would seem that the mistakes just keep coming. The therapist commends the client for simple tasks, like being on time and getting herself to therapy. People with disabilities often are commended just for getting up in the morning. This sentiment conveys how others cannot imagine how they would cope with a disability. The therapist makes two more errors, putting the final nails in the coffin of therapy. First, he states his comfort with blindness. If he were truly comfortable, he would not need to state this. As proof of his comfort he offers a completely irrelevant encounter as a child with a schoolmate who was blind. Nothing belies one's stated comfort level more than a "some of my best friends" story. Lastly, he conveys unnecessary detail about how Heidi should leave his office. Note the subtlety here; in this example, his excessive detail is patronizing and ignorant of how a blind person manages mobility. In the first example, when the therapist, Nicole, gave detailed information about the bathroom, it was helpful, and allowed Alette to make her own choice. The difference between these two examples shows how difficult it is to make hard and fast rules about disability etiquette. What works for one person or one disability may not work for another. Our third vignette shows a skilled therapist in an initial session with a new client. Like Alette, she has cerebral palsy, but in this case both her physical and cognitive symptoms are very different. In this vignette, it might be helpful to focus less on the therapist and more on the client and on trying to identify the disability issues and how they are manifest in the client's current concerns. Initial intake, Christine and Jody. 

00:39:20

00:39:20
CHRISTINE HALL  Hi Jody. 

00:39:35
JODY SOLLAZZO Hi. 

00:39:35
CHRISTINE HALL How are you, I'm Christine. (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
JODY SOLLAZZO Nice to meet you. 

00:39:35
CHRISTINE HALL  Right this way. You can have a seat right there. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:45
CHRISTINE HALL  Well, Jody, you told me a little bit on the phone about why you are here today, on that you're feeling a bit depressed. But do you wanna tell me a little bit more about what's going on with you? 

00:40:00
JODY SOLLAZZO Uhm, okay. Well, I don't know. I just, I, I just don't really feel happy. Like it, it feels like there is something missing. I fantasized about this part of my life as being, that I'd feel more resolved and settled and, and, I wouldn't, I don't know, I wouldn't be worried about things and everything just feels the same. It feels like the same as when I was like, like a dork in high school (laugh) and I just, I just don't, I don't know. I don't know what to, to do about it. Maybe this is just the way it is and my whole life is going to be like this. 

00:40:40
CHRISTINE HALL You were saying that, uhm, you were hoping that things would resolved. What would resolved look like? 

00:40:45
JODY SOLLAZZO I don't know. Just that I feel, like I feel, like I feel better. Like I just, I feel good about myself, and I feel like, I feel like I've, I don't know, like I've, I've, like I've faced adversity and I came through all these challenges and, and they're over. Like the challenges are over and I'm, and I've you know I, I, in life I thought that when I got into this, this graduate program, that I would, it was my dream to get into it and that now I have and I'm in it and it's just like, it, I thought things were gonna finally feel better and they just, they just don't. 

00:41:20
CHRISTINE HALL Okay. So how long would you say you've been feeling like this? 

00:41:25
JODY SOLLAZZO (sighs) I don't know. I mean, I felt like this on and off my whole life and I think when I first got into the graduate program I think I was happy. I think it's been going on for awhile, probably since, probably like a month after the program started. 

00:41:45
CHRISTINE HALL Okay. So you've really been struggling lately? 

00:41:45
JODY SOLLAZZO I worked really hard for no one to notice and, and hopefully they haven't noticed. But it, it's just sort of, whenever I'm alone I, like sadness overtakes me and, and I just, like, there's nothing that really feels fun. Everything feels like work. Even having fun feels like work. 

00:42:05
CHRISTINE HALL It's a big burden to carry a secret like that. 

00:42:05
JODY SOLLAZZO  I, I thought I was going to come to some place, you know, especially when I was younger. I idealized finally like, getting out and coming to some place where people would understand. But I just realized no one's really ever going to understand and I'm gonna always feel apart from people no matter what I do. So I've just stopped talking. (laughs) I've just stopped telling people stuff. You know, so. 

00:42:30
CHRISTINE HALL When you say that no one understands you, do you think that that's related to disability issues? 

00:42:35
JODY SOLLAZZO  Hmm, that's a really good question. I don't know. I mean, I just thought, like I thought, you know, when I was younger, people teased me a lot and, and I felt very apart from everybody. And a lot, I guess, like a lot of people told me, "Well, when you get older, it's going, it'll get better and people won't tease you." And you know, and you'll feel, you know, and in a way it's true, because it's not like anybody, you know is teasing me or throwing spitballs at me or something. But I just, so in a way, I should be happy. But, you know, in a way, in a way, like back then at least I knew, at least I knew, that that's what it was about. And now I feel, I feel really like apart from people and like maybe that's what it's about and, and because, maybe they just don't know really know how to connect with me but also maybe my experience. Be, I mean because everybody teased me, maybe I, I never really knew what it was like to be part of the group so now I don't even know how to be like part of them. I guess sometimes people don't know what to make of me and, um, I wish, I, I wish I knew. It's not like they're going to come out and say it like, like they did when, when I was younger. You know they're just to going to keep at a distance from me. If that makes sense, you know. 

00:43:55
CHRISTINE HALL  Kind of like now there's this big pink elephant in the room that no one is really talking about.(inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
JODY SOLLAZZO Right! Right. And no one really knows how to deal with it. And I'm sure that they're judging, maybe that's all they see when they see me and then everything I do or say is, is judged as a disabled person. 'Coz I'm in a writing program like, when I share, like my writing and my experiences. I guess, I always, I have like a voice that's coming from a place of feeling like an outsider, and I guess I thought like other people would, would understand it and it just seems like they, they still don't. 

00:44:30
CHRISTINE HALL What is it that you think. Uhm, they are not understanding now? 

00:44:35
JODY SOLLAZZO I don't know, like, I'm mostly, I, I've stopped writing about my own experiences in life because I feel, I felt like other people were, were being judge, judgmental about it. Like, you know like for example, like, when I was younger. Uhm, a lot of like, my, my boyfriends were older and I never and I wrote about that and people seemed like shocked by it. You know, they, they just kind of seemed to judge it and they were like, "Oh, you sounded like you were crazy when you were young." And, and I, I wasn't. It was just, and I think a lot of the reasons like, why they were a bit older was because maybe they could accept the disability a little bit more. And like and the other thing, okay, I remember, I remember another thing. It's just like people expect me to, to write like, ah, like people bring up things like, like "My Left Foot" around me. It's just like they expect me to write about disability all the time. People will ask something like, "Well, is this from, you know, a disabled person's point of view?" And you know, and, and I'm, I'm just like, sometimes, I'm just like, "No, this is, you know, something else." I guess they seem like maybe I embarrass them because they, they thought that it was going to be all about like, writing dis, you know writing disability and then when it's not. You know, they're, they're and I tell them it's not they're embarrassed and, so it's like, it's like kind of like they've been, you know, I don't know the word 'coz there, it's not racist but they've been like racist(ph), they've been, they're the ones that are being like, you know, whatever like discriminating. But yet, you know I've embarrassed them. Like they, you know, and it's all just seems like it's on me to make them feel comfortable. And on top of it I'm pissed off that I even have to do it. I already have more, I have, have enough to think about with it. 

00:46:25
CHRISTINE HALL You said that before, when you were younger. You had boyfriends that were more accepting. (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
JODY SOLLAZZO Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
CHRISTINE HALL How were they more accepting? 

00:46:30
JODY SOLLAZZO The weird thing is, is like they were older. But they were just sort of like any other, like boyfriend. They just treated me like any other girl. So, uhm, you know, I mean the, the thing is like I could never date anybody in my own school and I think that, like it wasn't you know, and I made excuses of like "Oh, well, you know, there's no cute guys here." Or I was like "All of the guys here are dorks anyway." But I really think that people didn't want to date me because, because they wouldn't, like "Oh, you're dating, like, the disabled girl?" And I was like the only one but there, there wasn't anybody with a, a disability in, in my school. So I looked for people that didn't really hang out with my peers I guess, because they didn't, you know, they, they weren't worried about what, what my peers were saying. The people, people like, you know, said I was slutty because I was dating an older guy. And, and like I, you know, my parents didn't really understand it. It's like you're asking me and I'm like reflecting on it and I'm realizing all this now at that time I didn't realize it. I didn't really think about it. It was just like, Oh, I'm dating this older guy because he's cool. (laughs) It wasn't like I had all this insight about it or anything but it's like and you know, I thought, I basically thought all that stuff would be behind me and, and now it's, it's just, it's different. It's, maybe it's better but it's just, it's just not behind me. 

00:47:45
CHRISTINE HALL I wanna thank you so much for coming in today and talking about some really tough topics. Uhm, I wanted to ask you a little bit about how the session felt to you and our relationship. 

00:47:55
JODY SOLLAZZO Good. I mean it, well, I feel good about it. This wasn't really what I was expecting even though I didn't think I was expecting anything. So it's like a lot of things I talked about, a lot of things I didn't really think I was gonna, you know talk about. And, like, you know, I feel good about it and I'll definitely, I'll definitely, you know, continue and, hopefully, hopefully I'll, I'll feel better. (titters) At some point. 

00:48:20
CHRISTINE HALL Okay, well, uhm, while we talk about some issues. Here in, in session, and some will be related to disa, disabilities and some not. And I know that you had mentioned before that it's hard for you when some people think your disability is a central issue. 

00:48:35
JODY SOLLAZZO Uh hmm. 

00:48:35
CHRISTINE HALL  Uhm, and I definitely want to not do that but we will need to bring it up sometimes. Uhm, and for example, I noticed that today you were a little bit late and I was wondering if that had anything to do with disability issues? 

00:48:50
JODY SOLLAZZO I'm just always late. (titters) It might, it probably just, I don't, it might just be the way, I never thought about it like, if it was a disability thing. And, I don't know, maybe it takes me longer to do things. And I'm, I'm timing it, I, like, I'm timing it like how it would be for everyone else and it's not. But I never really thought about it before. Oh, I don't know. May, maybe it is because, maybe I need to leave more time because of phy, physical reasons. It, great, now it's like another thing I have to do. (laughs) 

00:49:20
CHRISTINE HALL  I'm glad to hear uhm, that you're happy with the session and that you will be coming back. Uhm, I wanted to mention that even though the disability issues are long-term, the depression is treatable. We can definitely work on it here. Uhm, but I wanted to ask you what specifically are your disability issues at the present time? 

00:49:40
JODY SOLLAZZO I have cerebral palsy and all my life when I said that, to other people, it, it, it's a condition that has, like, varying degrees but when people, when I say it people just think of like, you know, people like, like, I don't know, like the "My Left Foot" movie, Daniel Day-Lewis that and he had a really, really severe case. And people, like people only think of the most severe case. So, sometimes I don't even like to tell people that's what it is. I just say, "It's a birth defect," or something. And it, it kind of is 'coz yeah, I was born prematurely and because of that, like it's, it's brain damage basically. And they would think that maybe there was like something more wrong, more wrong than there was or they, they would think that I just, I don't know, like not, not intelligent or not like, you know, like off balance. You know, like, you know, socially or something but yeah, that's, that's what it is so. 

00:50:35
CHRISTINE HALL Had there, are there any learning disabilities connected to cerebral palsy? 

00:50:40
JODY SOLLAZZO Like(ph) I test positive or whatever for, for ADD. It's always been hard for me to be organized. Ah, people have said at times that it's related to my disability and like, but I just sometimes think. Well, maybe, uhm, this is the way I am. (laugh) You know, going(ph), the, the late thing like that's maybe why I'm late to stuff, but I, I don't, I never really thought about it, like for, you know, thinking about, I just think, well, I have cerebral palsy and that's why I limp. And I don't really think about it being related to other things. You know, especially because, you know, like my parents, like when I was younger people would say, "That's all that's wrong. That's like, you just, you just walk differently and that's it." So it's really scary to think it has something to do with the way that I am in my life, or how it affects me personally. Uhm, I'd, (titters) I'd really just rather think, I'm a disorganized person that, that can't get themselves together... (crosstalk)

DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY Dr. Rhoda Olkin 

00:51:35
DR. RHODA OLKIN  Jody is coming with the common presenting problem of depression. However, there are many disability issues involved in her feelings. Like many people who endured childhood with a disability, she experienced teasing, ostracization, and discrimination. She was told that these factors would disappear as she got older. In fact in high school, when she dated older guys her disability was not an issue. But as she found out, as an adult the discrimination gets more subtle. Furthermore, her feelings of being an outsider have not dissipated. As the only one in her high school with a disability, Jody stood out. Like many people with disabilities, sometimes she just wants to blend in. So there's a way in which she hides, because to be in a room is to stand out. And having gone through adversity all through childhood, she feels like she's done her time. She's been through enough, and she'd like smooth sailing from now on in. It's disappointing to her, the way her disability continues to play a prominent role in her current social life and in her feelings. As she says, she idealized a future in which people would accept her for who she is, in which disability was just one facet of her but not the defining facet. Jody is also subjected to pressure in her writing program to be the disabled person. She is compared to one of the few media images of someone with cerebral palsy, namely the character in "My Left Foot." And her writing is expected to reflect the disability experience. She's seen as representing all people with disabilities. When she points this out to others they are embarrassed, and it becomes her job to help them handle their embarrassment. This is a common interaction for people with disabilities. Our disabilities make others uncomfortable or they say something that embarrasses them, and suddenly we feel the responsibility to help ease the social interaction. If we don't, we risk alienating people even more from people with disabilities. But we resent the job, and like Jody says, may get pissed off. Jody, as a young adult, is just starting to understand that her disability is more involved in her life than she'd wish. Maybe it has something to do with why she's always late. Maybe she's not really just disorganized but has a learning disability and ADHD, both of which are commonly associated with cerebral palsy. As stigmatized as her disability is, she struggles against the greater stigma of having cognitive impairments. And sometimes she lies about the nature of her disability to make it easier to deal with other people's reactions, something commonly seen in clinical practice. The therapist is quite right to take care to tell Jody that although her disability per se is not changeable, the depression is a treatable disorder. Depression is not the expected or modal response to disability, and should never be thought of as a required stage of adjustment to disability. Depression, whether in a person with or without a disability, should be addressed in therapy and considered a treatable disorder.

DISABILITY-AFFIRMATIVE THERAPY Conclusions 

00:55:15
DR. RHODA OLKIN  Before thinking about what we've seen, let me take a moment to acknowledge some of the limitations of this video. First, the clients depicted here were all females and Caucasian and thus they were two minorities; women and persons with disabilities. We have not discussed the interplay of their gender and their disability. Nor have we examined the experiences of being a member of other ethnic groups and disability. Religion, sexual orientation, and national origin would also be important factors to consider for understanding the context in which the disability occurs. Age is another factor. These were young adult clients, and issues for children with disabilities were not discussed, nor were issues of aging with a disability, or acquiring a disability later in life. Let's review what we did see. In this video, we've seen two therapists who were readily able to incorporate the disability into the therapy, and one therapist who allowed the disability to overshadow everything else. You might be thinking that no one therapist would make so many obvious mistakes. And although one therapist might not make each and every one of these mistakes, how many mistakes is too many? And if one is uncomfortable with disability, can't we expect mistakes, some obvious but many unconscious, to be apparent to the client? Please don't think that the take home message today is that therapists cannot make mistakes. All therapists make mistakes. Rather it is this. You must take efforts to increase your awareness, knowledge, skills, and comfort with disability. Then allow your own skills and talents as a therapist to take over and guide the treatment. Be open about your own mistakes and don't expect your clients to have to teach you how to be at ease with disability. You have some work to do. I hope this video has helped you in that regard. Thank you.
