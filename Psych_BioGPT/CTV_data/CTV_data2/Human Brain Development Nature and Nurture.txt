HELEN J. NEVILLE This baby seems to have the most valuable of all human resources. A healthy brain. Over the next weeks, months, and years this baby’s brain will change reflecting both the genetic potential he has inherited from his parents and the experiences in the real world that he is already starting to have. This film is about the interplay of factors that shape individual human brains over a life time.

DAVIDSON films & Classroom Productions present Human Brain Development: Nature and Nurture with Helen J. Neville, Ph.D. 

00:01:05
HELEN J. NEVILLE , Ph.D. Brain Development Laboratory University of Oregon Hello, my name is Helen Neville. For many years now, we’ve been studying the development of the human brain and we’re particularly interested in the role of experience or input from the environment, which is also referred to as Nurture. In shaping the development of our brains, we know that there’s not a dichotomy between nurture on the one hand and inborn characteristics or nature on the other hand. There’s a complex interplay between nature and nurture that determine every aspect of the development of our brains and all the functions that our brain support. What do we know about this newborn’s brain? He reacts to be in aspirated for instance, and can see faces directly in front of him. Over the course of the next few months, the neurons in his visual system will make trillions of connections as he pays attention to the world around him. In early childhood, the number of connections between neurons rises very rapidly. In terms of the nuts and bolts or hardware, the brain doesn’t look mature in terms of the size of the neurons, the density of neurons and connections between neurons for at least 20 to 25 years after birth. As the brains develops over childhood in adolescence, it becomes increasingly specialized. The adult brain is highly differentiated, a collection or mosaic of systems and sub-systems that are each highly specialized to perform different functions. But young brains are much less differentiated. This child, at this point, could adapt to live in a very diverse circumstances, could learn to speak any language on earth and could develop virtually any of the incredible number of skills that human kind has developed. Essentially, every aspect of this baby’s brain will be shaped by the experiences or nurture that he has during his unique life time.

Plasticity Lab Research on Neuroplasticity Intervention Studies 

00:03:00
HELEN J. NEVILLE In this film we will first discuss the concept of plasticity or the changeability of the brain. And then show you some of the ways we go about studying that in our labs here at the University of Oregon. We will then show you intervention research that we are doing with children in pre-school to see if what the research in our lab has told us has applications in the real world of children. 

00:03:25
Plasticity 

00:03:35
HELEN J. NEVILLE The adult brain contains specialized cells called neurons. 

00:03:40
neurons neuroplasticity 

00:03:40
HELEN J. NEVILLE About 200 billion of them. Each neuron makes about 10,000 connections with other neurons. The brain changes through the addition and loss of these connections. We call this process of change neuroplasticity. The changing of the brain by experience. Different brain systems display different degrees of plasticity. 

00:04:00
Profiles of Plasticity Constrained Modifiable and dependent Highly Modifiable 

00:04:05
HELEN J. NEVILLE Some are Constrained. They are not highly modifiable. Others are modifiable and dependent on experience, but only during certain time frames. And still others are are highly modifiable during all of life. The circuits in this baby’s brain that transmit discomfort will not change dramatically over his life time, an example of a constrain system. During the first few months of life there will great changes in the circuits that bring him visual images from his eyes to the back of the brain. After this initial wiring, which does depend on high quality visual input, there will not be large changes in this path way. Central vision is another example of system with a rather constrained profile of plasticity. 

00:04:55
constrained 

00:05:00
HELEN J. NEVILLE In constrained systems, even when experience is very different as it is for example if a person is born deaf, certain parts of the brain systems like central vision look the same as they do and hearing and sighted people. Although this baby probably can hear, which tests in the new brain nursery will soon determine, he doesn’t yet have the capacity to comprehend individual words. 

00:05:25
HELEN J. NEVILLE However, it is very likely that he will develop language, there is a very strong biological bias for humans to develop language and reduce so largely using regions of the left cerebral hemisphere. 

00:05:35
HELEN J. NEVILLE Over the course of his lifetime, this child will learn thousands of words through a variety of situations. Even though there is a strong biological basis for language to develop, the nature and quality of language skills will depend on the nature and quality of language, input he receives. He can continue to acquire new skills and information long into his lifetime. There are language-cognitive and motor systems that are highly modifiable throughout life. 

00:06:05
Highly modifiable throughout life 

00:06:10
HELEN J. NEVILLE We all learn new things everyday, when neurons receive input that make them fire that connection is strengthened. Neurons also continue to make new connections throughout life. However, with a lack of effective input, connections are weakened. This is basis of the expression, use it or loose it. 

00:06:30
Profiles of Plasticity. Constrained Modifiable and dependent 

00:06:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE And what about this middle profile, we don’t yet know how much this baby will be read to you and spoken to you directly by his parents in these next few years, but as it will show you there are certain time periods called sensitive periods. 

00:06:45
Highly Modifiable during certain time frames 

00:06:45
HELEN J. NEVILLE When this will be important for his brains development. Remember that chart we showed you showing how rapidly the number of connections in the brain grows. By two years of age, babies will have twice as many connections in their brains as their parents. Brains lose nerve connections that are unused or redundant, a process we call Pruning. 

00:07:05
pruning 

00:07:10
HELEN J. NEVILLE Most of these redundant connections are not needed, but sometimes they’re called into play when a human or an animal has to adapt to an unusual circumstance. For example, being born deaf or blind or having only one eye. During the course of the long development of systems in the brain, they exist for some systems windows of time in which this pruning and production of synopsis is crucial. We call these sensitive periods. 

00:07:35
sensitive periods 

00:07:40
HELEN J. NEVILLE It’s important to know that these time windows or sensitive periods are not the same between different systems or even within the same system. So for example, within a vision the sensitive period for the development of visual acuity extends from birth just up to five weeks after birth, but the sensitive period for the development of depth perception extends from birth till 11 months of age. And in the case of the language system there are several sensitive periods as we’ll see. 

00:08:15
Lab Research on Neuroplasticity 

00:08:20
HELEN J. NEVILLE Well, how do we know about these profiles of Plasticity? We have learned about them through empirical studies. And empirical studies involve experiments through designed to test specific hypothesis and that have stringent controls for other hypothesis and that produce data that are analyzed with great precision and care. 

00:08:45
HELEN J. NEVILLE Along with traditional psychometric assessments, we have used two non-invasive brain imaging techniques in our empirical studies. In some, we use a cap like this one, that places little pieces of silver on the scalp. These pick up the electrical signals that the neurons generate when they communicate with each other. It’s like eavesdropping in on the brains activity. Event-related brain potentials or ERP’s are voltage fluctuations in the EEG in response to a controlled stimulus. 

00:09:15
ERPS: Event Related Potentials 

00:09:20
HELEN J. NEVILLE They reveal the time course of activation of a particular set of neurons within milliseconds. Another non-invasive way we use in looking at the brain in action is the magnetic resonance imaging technique or MRI. The giant magnets in this machine track the changes of blood flow in the brain, thus giving fine spatial resolution images of the brain; images of where particular neurons are active and what connections exist. In order to understand how experience shapes the brain, we initially compared groups of people who have had very different lives from birth. We studied aspects of vision and people who were born completely deaf due to genetic reasons and compared them to aspects of vision in people who’ve had a life time of normal hearing. In this task, we asked both the deaf and hearing people to respond as soon as they noted a color shift. We also tested central vision in these groups. 

00:10:20
Comprehension Color & central vision hearing & deaf People constrained motion perception & peripheral vision test 

00:10:20
HELEN J. NEVILLE We found no differences between the groups of deaf and the groups of hearing people on these measures. These systems were constrained in their plasticity. But when we tested motion perception and peripheral vision we found that the people who were deaf from birth had a better ability to perceive objects in the far periphery of their vision than did the hearing people. The human visual system consists of two primary path ways. One that projects from the visual cortex up to the parietal cortex. 

00:10:50
visual cortex parietal cortex temporal cortex 

00:10:50
HELEN J. NEVILLE And another that leads forward to the temporal cortex. This one is important for processing central vision, color and form. It is not changed by auditory deprivation. Visual processing along this pathway is identical in normally hearing people and in deaf ones. It has a constrained profile of plasticity. It is largely unaffected by even the very profound experience of being deaf from birth. In marked contrast, every aspect of the dorsal pathway function that we’ve looked at including the motion perception, peripheral vision and attention are markedly enhanced in deaf subjects. The dorsal pathway has a special degree of plasticity. This plasticity in deaf people is reflected in enhancements, they do better at the task involved than do hearing people. 

00:11:40
HELEN J. NEVILLE However, the other side of plasticity is vulnerability. These functions of the dorsal pathway attention, the perception of motion, peripheral vision, these are very vulnerable in developmental disorders. For example, in people with dyslexia, who have special difficulty in learning to read, these people take much longer to detect up moving light in their periphery than people who can read normally. It seems as though the very functions that are most enhanceable when experience is different, or also the systems that are most vulnerable when experience isn’t just right. So in this way plasticity is a double-edge sword. 

00:12:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE We have also learned a lot about sensitive periods, the time limited windows of opportunity for neuroplasticity from studies of language. In humans all over the world, no matter what their language, their special systems within the left hemisphere of the brain that are important for most every aspect of language. And there are many different aspects of language. For example, phonology refers to the sounds of the language. 

00:12:55
phonology 

00:12:55
HELEN J. NEVILLE One phonological skill for example is your ability to tell the difference between the word lake and rake, which different just a single sound L or R. Some languages like Japanese for example, do not distinguish between L and R sound. And so, if people don’t learn this distinction by about four years of age, they have a very difficult time learning it later on. 

00:13:20
Profiles of Plasticity Constrained Modifiable and dependent Highly modifiable 

00:13:25
HELEN J. NEVILLE The sound system of language is an example of the middle profile of plasticity. It is modifiable and changeable but only within a restricted time period, probably the first four years of life. And the sound system of language depends on systems organized within the temporal lobe of the left hemisphere. Another aspect of language is grammar. 

00:13:45
grammar. “Grammar is the system of linking words together to make sense.” I am a student I are a student at the par we cake had and ice cream 

00:13:50
HELEN J. NEVILLE Grammar is the system of linking words together to make sense. Aspects of grammar of language include verb agreement, for example saying, I am a student, instead of I are a student. Another aspect is word order, the order of which we put words into sentences. If we were to present you with the sentence that contained of grammatical error, for example, At the part, we cake had and ice cream. This would elicit a highly focal brain response over the frontal part of your left, but not your right hemisphere. Another aspect of language is semantics. 

00:14:25
semantics objects, descriptions and events dog run blue at the part we had cake and socks 

00:14:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE Semantic processing is the process where by words refer to particular objects, descriptions and events. Words like dog, run and blue are in the semantic system of language, vocabulary if you will. Here, we can see that a word that is semantically unexpected in the sentence, at the part we had cake and socks, elicits a response over the back of the brain. 

00:14:55
HEARING SUBJECTS Written English Left Right 

00:15:00
HELEN J. NEVILLE The same regions of the left hemisphere that are active when hearing people process language are also active in congenitally deaf people who learn American sign language from birth, like Sarah. This suggest that there are biological similarities or nature that underlie all human languages. 

00:15:20
We’ll be putting a cap like this on your head, so that we can record your brain waves… 

00:15:25
HELEN J. NEVILLE What about hearing people who learn a second spoken language later in life, like Yoshko(ph), who learned English as a teenager. Well, the sound system of a language has this modifiable, but within sensitive periods profile of plasticity. Most people need to learn a second language by about age four in order to speak with the native accent. What about grammar? 

00:15:50
Left Hemisphere Right Hemisphere EARLY LEARNER LATE LEARNER 

00:15:50
HELEN J. NEVILLE Even people who start learning a second language by about age six have poor ability to use the grammar of a second language and they have a less focal more distributed pattern of processing for grammar. If the learning of a second language is delayed to age 12 or 13 years, brain organization is even more different and these people score much lower on tests of grammar. 

00:16:15
Profiles of Plasticity Constrained Modifiable and dependent Highly modifiable Middle Profile 

00:16:15
HELEN J. NEVILLE Grammar processing thus is an example of the middle profile plasticity. Highly modifiable, but only during sensitive periods. 

00:16:25
HELEN J. NEVILLE In contrast to phonology or the sound system of language and grammar, the semantic system in language retains the ability to change throughout life and can be set up in a native like fashion, even if you learn a language at a much later age. 

00:16:40
These electrodes are just kind of eavesdropping you know what’s coming from the brain… 

00:16:45
HELEN J. NEVILLE Yoshko(ph), for example has a very good vocabulary in English. You probably know about these differences in language from your own experience. It’s a lot easier to learn a vocabulary of a second language, than it is to learn the grammar or the sounds of the language. 

00:17:00
HELEN J. NEVILLE Now let’s talk about individual differences in speakers of only one language. It turns out the grammatical processing is not at all equal, even among adult native speakers. Adults who scored very high on test of English grammar, show this very focal left lateralize response to grammatical information. It is only on the left and not the right. Perfectly normal adults because of English without a second language who scored lower on the same test have a response that is more prolonged and not very focal. It is over both their left and right hemispheres. Remember, that focalization, specialization indicates more mature organization in the brain. 

00:17:55
These are Pingus family, they are eating at that their table. 

00:18:00
HELEN J. NEVILLE With children we test grammatical and semantic processing by presenting sentences with errors of both kinds in cartoons like this one. Monitoring their brain activity, we can see that by three years of age, the brains reactions to the two types of errors are already different. Bilateral and posterior for semantic errors, and anterior and left lateralize for grammar. 

00:18:20
The cap is under the chair, the cap is… 

00:18:25
On the chair. 

00:18:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE Even in quite young children, we found that children who scored higher on test of grammar, had more focalized response in their brains than children who had low scores, but once within normal limits. 

00:18:40
The dog is… 

00:18:40
Walking. 

00:18:40
Yeah. 

00:18:45
Intervention Studies 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:00
HELEN J. NEVILLE Knowing that there are sensitive periods for many aspects of language and cognition, we decided to develop an intervention program. So for the past year and a half now, we’ve been working with children who go to head start pre-schools who are three to five years of age. Before any intervention, we had to find out about these children in terms of their health and developmental histories. 

00:19:25
And then when did she started talking… 

00:19:25
Umm at… 

00:19:25
HELEN J. NEVILLE We had to know about their spoken language abilities, knowledge base and brain organization before our intervention. We also wanted to know about their ability to pay attention. 

00:19:40
…decided to build a cabin he borrowed an axe and cut down 12 trees Henry cut the logs… (cross talk) (inaudible ) 

00:19:45
HELEN J. NEVILLE This child has been asked to pay attention to only one of the stories that has being read at the same time. The story that is illustrated. 

00:19:50
…he borrowed an axe and cut down 12 trees Henry cut the logs (cross talk) 

00:19:55
HELEN J. NEVILLE This preliminary work requires about seven hours of assessment for each child. After it was done, we randomly assigned each child into one of six groups. 

00:20:05
music language attention parenting small control large control Parenting group small group 

00:20:10
HELEN J. NEVILLE For one group their parents participated in parenting classes. Three other groups had eight weeks of 40 minute small group special session consisting of only five children with our teacher, and an aid during their usual head start class time. 

00:20:25
music group language group attention group control group 

00:20:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE The activities for one group were musical. Another groups activities were about language. And still another groups activity is focused on attention. We also had control groups. One control group also had eight weeks of 40-minute sessions with our teacher and then aid and five children. But they participated in normal head start activities and not the focused interventions on music, language or attention. Another control group just participated in regular head start with the high a student teacher ratio as usual. 

00:21:05
HELEN J. NEVILLE After the interventions, we assessed the children again and what we have found so far, these are still preliminary results is that in eight short weeks, we improved many of the abilities of these children with our interventions. 

00:21:20
You’re the adult? 

00:21:20
Yes. 

00:21:20
And you’re the child. 

00:21:25
Yeah. 

00:21:25
Okay. Give a statement and then a choice, so that he gets involved. 

00:21:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE In the parenting group, we found significant gains in the children’s language in pre-literacy skills and also in memory and attention and IQ. 

00:21:35
I like this one. 

00:21:40
Okay, let’s go. 

00:21:40
All right. 

00:21:40
Yeah that was perfect. 

00:21:40
Take the part that you feel to skin off and rub it on your lips and see how it feels on your lips. 

00:21:45
HELEN J. NEVILLE For the attention group scores went up on language in pre-literacy skills, attention in memory, visuospatial skills enough(ph). I have come to think that attention plays an enormous role in plasticity. 

00:22:05
HELEN J. NEVILLE Studies with animals have shown that attention is a key component of neuroplasticity. In our studies with the deaf and blind individuals show that attention itself is highly changeable or plastic. Moreover, our studies of language impaired children and children at risk for school failure show that attention is also a highly vulnerable system. 

00:22:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE However, our studies of the interventions show that attention can be changed, it can be enhanced. For example, remember the congenitally deaf people who had improve peripheral vision. A deaf person has to pay more attention visually to what is happening around here, because she doesn’t have sound cause. Experience, nurture has strengthened Sarah’s ability to attend perhaps by selectively keeping some of those extra connections that are made in early childhood. 

00:23:00
(cross talk) (inaudible ) 

00:23:05
HELEN J. NEVILLE We can study attention both with the double story method we showed you, but also with visual methods. In this kind of test, we have you focus your eyes on a center dot, but to focus your attention to the side, you can do it. This is how your brain looks when you focus attention, but not your eyes on this area. A split second after the light flashes the brains response is more than twice as large as when you were attending away. And this is how a deaf person’s attention looks in the same experiment. There is twice as large of enhancement of attention as compared to hearing people. Through their experiences in the world, acting on the anatomy and physiology of their developing brains, deaf people have learned to focus their visual attention. Attention is modifiable. 

00:24:05
HELEN J. NEVILLE If a person has good attentional skills, these can be applied to and can benefit everyone of the activities that they perform at school, you know including reading, math, sciences and so forth. And attention can also benefit all the out of school activities that we do like learning to play a musical instrument, learning to program, participating in sports, indeed it may be that attention is our greatest learning resource. Attention is like a big amplifier. The fact that attention can be trained is cause for great optimism. It will be important for future research to determine whether attention could be trained at any time in development or whether those time periods are restricted. 

00:24:45
Profiles of Plasticity Constrained Modifiable and dependent Highly modifiable 

00:24:50
HELEN J. NEVILLE So what have we learned about brain development? That brain start off with some systems that change minimally during life. Other systems continue to change throughout life and the middle profile, the one we most discussed in this film is the one in which aspects of systems are modifiable, but only during limited time periods. These sensitive time periods vary between and within systems. By knowing more about these sensitive periods, we can make interventions that improve performance on a variety of abilities. The direction of growth in brain systems is towards organization and specialization. Immature systems lack this specificity. 

00:25:30
HELEN J. NEVILLE Our brains are our most precious resources and they are highly modifiable. In this short film, we just introduced you to some concepts about brain development and the special interacting roles of nurture and nature in human brain development. Some of the key discoveries about the human brain development have been that it takes 20 to 25 years, before the hardware building blocks of the brains is fully developed. And that during this long development, most every aspect of brain function is shaped by experience. Knowing this gives us great optimism and a great sense of responsibility. We can use our understanding of a brains development to provide experiences that will maximize its potential for all.
