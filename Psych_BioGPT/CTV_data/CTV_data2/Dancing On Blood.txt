DANCING ON BLOOD 

00:00:00
Therapist ARTHUR ROBBINS, Ed.D., ATR, HLM 

00:00:00
Patient: SUSAN 

00:00:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS There are many visions and voices that go on in an art therapy relationship. There is the play of form and formlessness, of image and words. We see the complex interaction of space, color, form, energy, all interrelating to one another in the context of what commonly goes on in a therapy relationship. There are projections and interjections. There is the real relationship. And of course, there is also the soul of the treatment that is often captured in the art form, for if our eyes find the deep center, the interior, it becomes the source of energy as our eyes, if we don't try to superimpose our vision, moves in its own particular rhythm from the inside to the outside in its own particular motion and space. And at times, our eyes stop and become frozen in time as psychological conflict interfaces with perception and we are locked in and it does not move. Often we try to see how the center is held, does it resonate, does it squeeze, is our feel to open up, and is there a balance of forces going from the various polarities of the art form, from inside to outside, from various plays of color and light and shading, and indeed, whether the movement goes up or down, out or in, all have to do also with the varieties of images and pictures that we hold inside of us that we try to shape in the art form. And this becomes part of the total context of the treatment relationship. Hopefully, this videotape will capture this form of interaction that is so hard to express in words. What I'd like to discuss with you is the very short-term treatment of a woman who is in her 40s. She's an artist, has been an artist for the last 15 years, and before that, was a dancer. And she has agreed to enter this treatment and realizes that she is being videotaped. I will not show you the first session, for there is no art to speak of, and the first session, as it flowed, did not provide a space for it to happen. But I will summarize what really the highlights are, for as she came down the hallway and she muttered to herself, "What am I getting myself into?" and I heard this and brought it up, she said that she was anxious and anxious about the impact if her family ever saw this videotape. And I reassured her that this videotape would have to meet her approval before it went out of our particular hands. And she felt relieved and wondered to herself why she could not afford herself that kind of protection, and this opened up her whole history of sometimes the self-destructive relationships she'd had, how she plunges in without thinking and reflection how the relationship of her first two husbands was highly romanticized and yet very destructive. There was much harm to the very essence of who she was as she struggled to get out of these relationships. She described her family, her mother who came over here at 5 from Germany and escaped the Holocaust and how she was tricked to come on a boat and was promised by her family that she would be given a gift and her father would come afterwards. But indeed, the father could not escape and he was killed in a concentration camp. The mother grew up with this pall around her, felt that the father had given up his life for the family. She, the mother, is morose, sad, depressed, and has a particularly locked-in relationship with Susan, the patient. She does not speak about the Holocaust, but it pervades the family. She's sad, she's depressed, she clutches on with these sad eyes, these eyes that I'm very much aware of, by the way, in Susan. And I say to Susan, "You know that your eyes are particularly attractive. They hold to me the vision of both a clown and the sadness of a clown," and she said, "You know, hardly anybody has ever said that to me, but it is true." And she told me about the eyes of her mother, who was so sad. And then the eyes of her grandmother, she said, "You know, you must see a picture of my grandmother. They are strong, they are soulful. They are the power of a woman to see much sadness, but they are alive." She then explores and tells me about her own art, that her own art that she does professionally is on the pier down in Florida, and she calls it the Sunrise Theatre, for she likes to do pictures of the horizon and the water and the sky. And this has become a particularly important thing in her professional work. She says to me that really the biggest and problematic relationship of her life is that of her mother. And I say to her, "Well, perhaps it is your mother that we should address, and maybe you would like to do a picture of her and let your arms and hands speak about who she is." But she also mentioned to me as she was going out, "You know, I go to a synagogue right around here, even though my own family, which is a middle class family, a Jewish family, but is not particularly religious. I have an older brother, a younger brother, and I am in the middle." She says, "I have rediscovered Jewish religion in the synagogue near here, and it has become particularly meaningful." I do not know why she brings this in, but I realize it's important. So we leave on the note for her to address whatever comes up from one session to another, bring it in, and we'll see where it goes from there. So now we go into session two.

Session 2 

00:07:40
SUSAN Can I tell you one more thing before I show you? I kind of hesitated all week. It's like I wanted to do the assignment, I was afraid to do it. I wanted to do it. And then finally, today I looked through, I have had a few really great painting days in my studio, then I start looking through photographs to find photographs of my mother. I realize that I have tons of them of my father, my sister, my brothers all over the house. I have no photographs, I show no photographs of my mother. I had to dig for them. And then I thought I would draw her, and I look into her face in all of these photographs, and I thought I would work maybe from a photograph, and she looked so harmless, so like lovely, almost, and like this. I showed nothing of what, it was perplexing to me and it almost kind of caught me, it didn't catch me in my throat, like, this is the woman that I have assigned such a powerful negative? And it struck me, and then I realized, no, I have to go on my own. I have to. And I got out these water-soluble crayons and a piece of paper and I just started going. And so this is my mother. 

00:09:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay. So let's take a look. And how does it feel to enter that picture? Can you get into it? Does it invite you in? Does it keep you out? Where does your eye go to? 

00:09:25
SUSAN I don't know. I kind of feel, where does my eye go to? 

00:09:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. 

00:09:35
SUSAN It goes all over the place, really. 

00:09:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS But does it find anything that's an inside there? Does it get into an interior? 

00:09:45
SUSAN Well, I think the source is there. 

00:09:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Now, you look into that source, and what happens to you, feeling-wise? 

00:10:00
[sil.] 

00:10:05
SUSAN These are tough questions. 

00:10:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS Tell you what, let's try it a different way. Since I know part of your background is dance, if you had to dance this piece, how would you dance it? What would happen to your body? 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:35
SUSAN I feel that it's a place of stillness and also fire, like a very fiery, clear, almost fierce clarity. 

00:11:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS I can see that. Go ahead. 

00:11:05
SUSAN I had a strange experience after I did it, that I realized because I was trying to not think body or feature, and suddenly it felt me like two things. It felt to me like an eye, a wide open, like a frightened eye. Really frightened, like looking at a city on fire or something. A left eye. And then I also thought about if this is like her body, also this is like a placement in the proportionate scheme of things of the whole. 

00:11:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS So when you start looking at this a little more, a fiery and yet piercing calmness, but fragmented. And I think at this, when you look at it, what happens to it? 

00:12:00
SUSAN I do, in a funny way. I start to see a very frightening face. 

00:12:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Could you describe it to me? 

00:12:15
SUSAN Like a Munch and like a blue mouth, and skeletal, like a, almost a little bit 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS A blue monkey and a skeletal guard. 

00:12:35
SUSAN You know Munch, the painter? The Scream? 

00:12:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yes, yes. 

00:12:40
SUSAN I feel a little of that, almost. 

00:12:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay. Now, that is both the eye and it might be the heart. I could be both, the eye and the heart combined. Where else does your eye go? Does your eye stay there? Does it move away? 

00:13:05
SUSAN It actually kind of moves all over the place. 

00:13:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Show me with your finger. 

00:13:15
SUSAN It moves into here for some reason. It moves into the torn paper. It moves here where it's really so dark, but there are these pieces of light that are almost, like, underneath it. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
SUSAN Where else does it move? 

00:13:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS Does it go back to the eye, or does it stay away from the eye? 

00:13:45
SUSAN It's funny, it stays away from the eye. It goes, the eye, that's why it was hard for me to say, "This is the part that stands out," but I don't think that it's the focus of the painting or the whatever it is. 

00:14:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS So it has power in it, but it's not, it's tremendously powerful, but yet, it's not the organizer. In other words, you've got material that has its own unity, and then you have this eye that is so powerful of both frightening pierceness, calm, and on fire. And certainly Munch's prints are what I would think of that kind of panicked, fierce kind of quality to it. When you look at that eye, and what comes to your mind? 

00:14:40
SUSAN Fire. I told you that. Fire. 

00:14:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS And when I ask you about fire, what comes to mind with you and fire? 

00:14:45
SUSAN Me and fire? Me and fire? 

00:14:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. 

00:14:55
SUSAN Real destruction. Real destruction. 

00:14:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS What do you know about that in yourself? 

00:15:00
SUSAN About fire? 

00:15:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yes. For instance, people who know you, would they call you fiery? 

00:15:05
SUSAN No. Probably not. 

00:15:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Would anybody call you fiery? 

00:15:10
SUSAN No, probably not. 

00:15:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Would you call yourself fiery? 

00:15:20
SUSAN No, probably not. No. I wouldn't. 

00:15:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS Do you live more over here? 

00:15:25
SUSAN Absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:15:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS And when you say you live over here, the blue, where you first went over here, what would you call that? What's the affect state of that? 

00:15:40
SUSAN It's funny. I think about it more, for some reason, like meadows and tall grass and nighttime and movement. I see this more static, in some way. 

00:16:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS More static. So that there's a real dialectic between that fierce static or mobilized eye and the almost pastoral scene with its own beauty and calmness. And I'm reminded of your actual artwork which has this unending possibilities in that kind of scene, and yet there is this eye that is somewhere deeply connected to this painting. It gives it a certain kind of compelling quality because there's such a contrast between the two. So this eye that looks so fiery, immobilized. What is it that you know? What do you see in that eye? Penetrating? 

00:17:10
[sil.] 

00:17:15
SUSAN I see, actually, rather than penetrating, I see a kind of an emptiness, like a burnt-out, more of a pathos than power. I see more like the kind of eye where you've focused for so many hours that the eye is actually wide open and very tired. Yeah. 

00:17:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Now, that eye that is so tired, what does it bring up? Its pathos. 

00:18:00
SUSAN Yeah, it brings up in some way the burden of the ancestry. 

00:18:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS The burden of the ancestry. And I know we were talking about the eyes, which are your grandparents', and the pathos that it's, at least in your opinion. It's interesting. If you had to, even though it has this compelling intrusion, what's the real center of this art piece, the real interior? If we took that away, so to speak, where would the center be? Would there be any center, in fact, or would there something 

00:18:45
SUSAN Well, it's kind of interesting. It's almost without a center. 

00:18:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS It's almost without a center. 

00:18:50
SUSAN It is without a center. 

00:18:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS So even though this is not the center, it plays an important role. 

00:18:55
SUSAN Yes, it does. Yeah. Good point. 

00:19:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS What is the role that it plays for you? 

00:19:05
SUSAN It's a landmark of some kind. 

00:19:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS It's a landmark. 

00:19:10
SUSAN It's the only spot on the paper that is not washed over or overworked. You know what I mean? 

00:19:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay. So it's a landmark on the paper. 

00:19:25
SUSAN It's like some, in some way, a clear spot. 

00:19:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS So it gives you a clarity, a definition, no matter upsetting and fierce it is and sad 

00:19:40
SUSAN You know, it's looking to me a lot like a wound now, actually. 

00:19:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS What comes to your mind about that wound? 

00:19:50
SUSAN The eye, I mean, I'm still doubling back on it as an eye. When you said "penetrating," and I said, "No, no. It goes the other way." It's not 

00:20:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS It's been wounded. It's been wounded. The eye has been wounded. 

00:20:05
SUSAN Yeah. It's like a bloody eye. I mean, even though it's orange, it's like a wound. It's like a wound. 

00:20:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS When you look at that wounded eye, bring up anything? Bring up any kind of feelings, connections? 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS We see an interesting phenomenon in this session. We see how Susan identifies a very powerful force in this session, which technically we call an interject. It is not her center, but it is such a compelling force and so powerful that your eye is immediately drawn to it. But as she moves away from it, she does not go back to it. It is not the source of her energy but is the source of an enormous amount of organization and affect. It is bloodied, it goes inside, it is passive, it haunts her, it is accusatory. It is something that Susan constantly lives with. And so, we are faced as to how to process this interject because it is like a foreign body, it's like a bad piece of food that is not really digested inside and interferes with the mirroring of the self since it is so strong and power in the total organization of her personality. So we see how we struggle to neutralize this force. I first ask her to move and see if she can sense this eye in her whole body, and she does, though I note that she's not that comfortable moving. And she knows she feels it and she sees the eyes are closed. It doesn't really see outside. It is all inside. And this is what the mother's about. She's inside. She doesn't see her daughter. She hasn't got the eyes to mirror. And then we are faced, still, the associations don't flow, and so we decide to further elaborate and amplify this eye. And so we go back and draw in the session. Tell me about it. Tell me how it felt, doing this. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:10
SUSAN It is difficult to trust that whatever is coming out of my hand has anything to do with, like, how to feel it in color and line and all that without knowing where it's going. It's uncomfortable, in a way. 

00:23:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS Now, that is fascinating. Because you started out the treatment here with the statement "I like to be on the edge where I don't know where it's gonna go." 

00:23:40
SUSAN It's very fascinating. 

00:23:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. 

00:23:45
SUSAN Yeah, I know. I think I changed my mind on that. Very good! Oh, that's good! Yeah, yeah. I know. No. I like to feel like I don't know where I'm going. 

00:24:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS But you don't know where you're going with this. That's uncomfortable. 

00:24:05
SUSAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:24:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS Because this is different. How is this different? 

00:24:05
SUSAN This is very different. I have nothing to hang onto. I have, it's almost as though I know that I don't want to draw a sad, painful, or, well, an eye. I don't want to draw a wounded eye. I mean, I could've actually. 

00:24:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. But this came out. 

00:24:25
SUSAN Yeah. 

00:24:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS Now tell me how it makes your body feel. How it feels. You're carrying this with you. 

00:24:35
SUSAN Well, it's funny, because it doesn't, like I am, while I'm doing it, kind of also always tempted to try to judge it or try to make some sense out of it while I'm doing it. 

00:24:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah, you have to suspend, if you can. 

00:24:55
SUSAN Yeah, and that's very hard because immediately I have this draw toward composition and toward, do you know what I mean? What the elements are, what the color choices are. But there were certain things, certain moments that felt very, very connected. Certain movements and color choices that I felt very honest about. I mean, it's like how to make it an honest experience when you don't really know what it is that you're doing or why. 

00:25:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS So that's the state you tried to be in. 

00:25:40
SUSAN Yeah. 

00:25:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS And as you look at it now, where are you? 

00:25:50
[sil.] 

00:25:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS Is that image with you or very far away or? 

00:25:55
SUSAN It's with me. I don't necessarily, yeah. It's with me. It is with me. 

00:26:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS And once again, if you had to dance this movement, how would it be? 

00:26:10
SUSAN Do you want me to dance it? 

00:26:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. 

00:26:10
SUSAN I feel like I almost, it's very wild. I almost would have a hard time 

00:26:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay, then just tell me, wild? 

00:26:20
SUSAN Very, yeah. I see, actually, even more so than the thing that I brought in, I see a kind of an almost bloody 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:50
SUSAN Frenetic. 

00:26:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS A little less certainty. Much less stationary. Or at least I can't see that stationary 

00:27:00
SUSAN Spot. 

00:27:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS Spot anymore. So it's wild and frenetic. 

00:27:05
SUSAN And somehow, I did know for some reason, it was almost as though I did know what I was doing with that blue. But it came, I would say it came honestly, but I did know what I was doing with 

00:27:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS What is the blue do for it? 

00:27:30
SUSAN Well, for some reason or another, I think the blue is water and that it's cooling. It's cooling. And somehow it contains it. I mean, it's almost like 

00:27:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS It contains the fire. 

00:27:50
SUSAN Yeah. 

00:27:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS The water contains the fire. 

00:27:55
SUSAN Water contains the fire. Water puts out the fire. Water puts out the fire. A ritualized kind of a ceremonial thing where this slaughtered, let's say, antelope, 'cuz I seem to see horns here. I see an animal is like almost floating, but the point is that it's gonna fall into the water, that it's gonna all disappear. It's gonna go under. 

00:28:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS And any associations to the slaughtering animal as a ritual that floats on water and ultimately disappears? 

00:28:45
SUSAN No. 

00:28:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS You've been going to services lately. You've been rediscovering Jewish religion. And certainly, there is this famous of Abraham offering his son's 

00:29:00
SUSAN Well, I was thinking about that. I was thinking about it. That's what I was thinking of. But then I thought there's no water, and then I thought about the parting of the sea also and the covering up of the enemy, the Egyptians going through the water, and then the sea 

00:29:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS And the Jews were saved that night by putting some kind of 

00:29:25
SUSAN Blood on the door, right. 

00:29:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS Blood on the door. And with that blood on the door, they were not, their first sons were not killed. 

00:29:35
SUSAN Right. 

00:29:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Right. And that was the story that was given in the freedom of the Jews from their persecutors as they were running from them and escaping persecution. 

00:29:50
SUSAN Yeah. Yeah. But I'm more fixed on the Dead Sea. I'm more fixed on the parting of the water and the, I can't even remember who is gobbled up. Isn't it that they get through? 

00:30:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS They get through and the Egyptians 

00:30:05
SUSAN They get through and then the water closes up on the Egyptians. 

00:30:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Egyptians who are pursuing them. And then the Jews escape but wander for 48 years. Almost as an act of purification, I guess, before they reach the promised land. But they're escaping a persecutor. Now, anything come to your mind about the persecutor? 

00:30:45
SUSAN It's a terrible thing to say, but I do see my mother as the persecutor. I think it's a terrible thing to say. 

00:30:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS In what way? 

00:30:50
SUSAN Why terrible? Or in what way is she a persecutor? I really called her a dream-killer. 

00:31:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS How so? 

00:31:05
SUSAN Because nothing matters. Things don't matter. 

00:31:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS When you see this picture over here, is that the mother? 

00:31:15
SUSAN Yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:31:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS If that is the mother, you're saying that this mother of yours has been terrorized, has been immobilized and frozen in time with terror and fear till she is empty and naked in fear. So how does this relate to you, personally? 

00:31:40
SUSAN Personally? 

00:31:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS First of all, are you running all the time from being persecuted and killed? Is that what function that running is about, that even though you search for peace and serenity, is that part another piece of you, the runner? Runner from your persecutor? 

00:32:05
SUSAN It's funny, I want to say that I'm running from stillness, that I'm running from stillness and maybe this is the stillness. The terror, the stillness is almost like a terror. 

00:32:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Like a terror. So you're running. Running from the stillness. But that stillness, as I would understand it, is somebody frozen in fear. It's not a peaceful stillness. 

00:32:30
SUSAN No. It's not a peaceful stillness, no. 

00:32:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS It's somebody who's been traumatized. 

00:32:35
SUSAN Right. But it seems, actually, it's interesting because, like I said, when I go home, I come home feeling like I'm, I come back to New York feeling a foot shorter and 100 pounds heavier. That stillness, like that kind of complacent kind of, I get so restless when I go home, almost like painfully so. I can't bear to take it all in. 

00:33:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Well, you're, in a sense, almost like have a magnet to be swallowed up into this void of immobility, of terror, of a trauma which you must escape. 

00:33:25
SUSAN And no hope. No hope. 

00:33:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:30
End of Session 2 

00:33:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS One of the most telling aspects of this session is we see how often Susan is numb and cut off from her feelings. She's dissociated, as many patients are, when they are exposed to traumatic experiences, and though she has directly little to do with the Holocaust, the Holocaust surrounds her. And one of her most important defenses is dissociation. So it is difficult for her to be in touch with this affect. So what other defenses uses is one of running, of moving, of going up into the air, the water. By the way, when she paints a good deal in her home in Florida, and that gives her a certain degree of peace and opens up her life and she paints as well it, as she says it, it's the theater of the sunrise horizon, as things open up for her. But the ground for her is really something she does not live on, and Mother Earth really does not hold her. It is where the air, where the water is, it is there in the water that holds her, and she struggles with all the rage, the upset, and the problems of really separating from this very powerful force. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:05
Session 3 

00:35:10
SUSAN I felt like a kindergartener and this gave me, I was almost again like a little embarrassed that it made me so happy. 

00:35:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS So this three-legged dancer. 

00:35:20
SUSAN The three-legged dancer. 

00:35:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS What is she dancing? 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:40
SUSAN What is she dancing? It's a very lyrical dance. It's a very wave-like, and happy. 

00:35:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Unhappy? 

00:35:55
SUSAN Happy. Yeah, definitely. 

00:35:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS What kind of dance is it? 

00:36:00
SUSAN A happy dance. 

00:36:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS What kind of music? 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
SUSAN Tough questions. Okay, I would say Irish is the first thing that comes to my mind. Irish. Okay. 

00:36:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS An Irish dance. 

00:36:20
SUSAN Irish. 

00:36:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Could you show me what an Irish dance? No? Okay. How does an Irish dance, like a 

00:36:30
SUSAN Well, it's very like, I said Irish because it's like, I don't know. Israeli! It's Israeli. Irish! 

00:36:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Irish-Israeli. 

00:36:40
SUSAN I don't know. It's like, yeah, it's Irish-Israeli. Like this. You know, like this. Is that enough? 

00:36:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. 

00:36:45
SUSAN Okay. 

00:36:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS So it's really upward movements. 

00:36:50
SUSAN And very loose wrists. It's almost like the wrists and the head are not even connected, somehow. And I'm thinking to myself, it's interesting that this was my first movement. And I was thinking that somehow in this one, it's like the energy of the spine really is rooted in the ground more than the legs. That kind of surprises me. 

00:37:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS How so? 

00:37:25
SUSAN I don't think of myself as really rooted. I definitely comfortable up here. 

00:37:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS So when you go up there, what happens? 

00:37:45
SUSAN Well, up there, that's where the air is. That's where all the air is. 

00:37:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS And when you are in the air, what happens to your body? 

00:38:00
SUSAN I feel almost like, it sounds funny, I feel almost like akin with the wind. I feel, I'm in space. I have space around me. There were certain things that were going through my mind as I was doing this. And the red started out very, very disturbing, like lines of blood, almost, that went across like this. All the way across like that. And I don't know. Maybe in some way maybe I'm dancing to try to obliterate it, to try to like, almost like a superficial thing because I could stand the, can't stand what's underneath it. I mean, this to me was disconcerting. It started getting all muddy and it 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:10
SUSAN And in some ways, and then I thought about fire. I thought about fire and 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:20
SUSAN That it was almost so polar that this was, for me, the bottom part was the trouble. 

00:39:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS The trouble. 

00:39:30
SUSAN Yeah. And that the top part was more air and birds and the animals and water and whales. But the bottom part was trouble. I couldn't really decipher it, so I just like, almost like, and it was almost a little bit of a desperate move. I just put that figure on top of it. 

00:39:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS So you up for trouble? 

00:39:55
SUSAN Am I up for trouble? I'm always up for trouble. 

00:39:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS You are? 

00:40:00
SUSAN No, yes and no. Yes and no. I'm ambivalent. 

00:40:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS How much are you ready to go back to the bloody eye? 

00:40:05
SUSAN Definitely. I'm game. 

00:40:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS You're game? 

00:40:10
SUSAN Absolutely. What do you think I'm here for? I am game. 

00:40:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS You are game? 

00:40:15
SUSAN Yeah. Should I not be game? Do you know something I don't know? 

00:40:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS No. 

00:40:20
SUSAN Okay. 

00:40:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS I just thought I'd ask you. What were your thoughts and reactions from that session? 

00:40:30
SUSAN It was an interesting one because it felt to me so nonlinear that I couldn't think on a conscious level about it. But I felt good this week, and I don't really know why. And I really felt good. And my, I mean, I couldn't, like, drag myself away from my studio. If I started late in the day, I would just, like, indulge myself in there till 2:00 AM. Then I'd wake up, and if I didn't feel like getting up, I said, "I'm not gonna get up. I'll start working later and I'll work as long as I want, and if that's all day and all night, fine. And if it's two hours, fine." The work feels rooted right now. Oh, I'll tell you what I thought of that came from the session, that, and it had to do, it does have to do with eyes and it had to do with the sad eyes of my grandmother and about oppression. And that I feel always very obliged to be happy. And I find that to be an incredible burden. And this week, I just decided the hell with it. It's almost feels better not to be happy than to be happy. But do you know I mean? It feels, it's almost like there's no way in hell that I could perform in this session because the questions were new, the way of working is new, I don't know what's expected of me, so I can't perform. And when I left, you said, "That's the idea, not to perform. It doesn't matter if your jewelry are jangling or whatever, to determine this freedom." 

00:42:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS Question, you said there're things going on between you and your mother and you couldn't give up the game. You wanted something from her and then when she was beholding it. In last session, you touched upon that your mother was very involved with the Holocaust, perhaps using it, perhaps not. But it was there, it was there with an accusation. 

00:43:05
SUSAN It's there, big time, that she suffered and that nobody's gonna take that away from her and that that suffering elevates her, makes her special. Her history makes her special and gives her more than enough reason not to trust anyone. It gives her license to hate. 

00:43:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS And how does that impact on you? Well, it's interesting. I really feel in some way like we had to, we were obliged to lift her up, almost, or to be happy, to be this and to be that. To be 

00:44:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS To pick her up, to make her feel 

00:44:05
SUSAN To pick her up. To pick her up, yeah. 

00:44:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS And then 

00:44:10
SUSAN I would never go to my mother to pick me up. Never. 

00:44:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS So did you pick yourself up? 

00:44:20
SUSAN I learned how to do it. In some ways, sometimes it reminds me, I've thought of this whole thing as actually a gift. The neglect, or whatever you want to call it, that I really had to come up with ways and come up with a relationship to life. 

00:44:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS So there you are, dancing on blood. 

00:44:45
SUSAN Right. In a way. Yeah. Yeah, in a way. 

00:44:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS That's a startling image, dancing on blood. 

00:44:50
SUSAN Yeah. 

00:44:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS Your hands are raised, eyes really, Irish jig. You're dancing on blood. Anything come to your mind about that? Reaching up to the 

00:45:20
SUSAN It's a little glib, I think, in a way. 

00:45:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Glib? 

00:45:25
[sil.] 

00:45:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS So do you think this is a little bit on the contrived side, or easy or what? 

00:45:40
SUSAN No. Because also, when I made that white, and thinking about it now, it was like marking the doorposts, like we talked about last week, of Passover and the angel of death saying, "Mark your doors." I mean, it's like the reverse of that. It's not marking with blood; it's marking with just the opposite. It's marking with air or with, like, I don't know. 

00:46:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Here's the air. You're dancing on it. It's interesting. It's the reverse of it. The blood was used to warn the people. Here 

00:46:30
SUSAN It's the absolute reverse. 

00:46:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS And the reverse being, you're dancing on it, that would be the reverse? You're using 

00:46:35
SUSAN No, the reverse is that the mark is not 

00:46:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS To warn? 

00:46:40
SUSAN Well, the mark was made with blood, right? It was made with lamb's blood. This, on the doorpost, right, this is, the mark is made with air or with the essence of all things free. Made on, marked on the earth, marked on blood, like 

00:47:10
[sil.] 

00:47:15
SUSAN Like a way of making my own mark, insisting on it. Insisting on it. Insisting on life. 

00:47:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS And reaching out to air. 

00:47:30
SUSAN Yeah. And it almost is like, and I've done this a lot is this kind of, that gesture of like the star. A mark. 

00:47:45
[sil.] 

00:47:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS Anything more about coming and dancing on blood? Comfortable image? Uncomfortable? Feelings about it? 

00:48:05
SUSAN Yeah, I feel like for some reason there's a kind of shame that we all felt, growing up in the house with my mother. Not with my father, who had an equally marked history. 

00:48:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS And the shame being? 

00:48:30
SUSAN That we didn't, that we don't know anything about suffering. 

00:48:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Whereas your mother does. But she never speaks about it. 

00:48:40
SUSAN Right. And that we, that in other words, that's why I said this was glib, because I sometimes think that given that situation, given, let's say if I were in the Holocaust, what kind of courage would I have, what would happen to this spirit of mine that is so supposedly strong? It's almost like 

00:49:15
[sil.] 

00:49:20
SUSAN I accuse myself on some level of whatever is in my spirit being phony or thin, and that if I really had to suffer, it wouldn't be there. Which is terrible, actually. 

00:49:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay, so then talk to me about against joy. 

00:49:40
SUSAN There's an indictment against joy. Yeah. 

00:49:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS And you define that indictment, if anything, you dance on blood. And you reach out. 

00:49:50
SUSAN Right. Right. 

00:49:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS And nobody's going. And you said for your ground. 

00:49:55
SUSAN Right. I used the blood for my ground. 

00:49:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS That's right. 

00:50:00
SUSAN Yeah. That's right. That's right. But then I'm confused because I think I came in here and I said, "I'm actually happy that I didn't have to feel so damn happy this week." 

00:50:10
[sil.] 

00:50:15
SUSAN That I didn't do the usual this week, that I didn't dance, you know, dancing on blood, I mean, that's major work. 

00:50:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Major. 

00:50:25
SUSAN That's major work, right. Right. 

00:50:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS What do you mean by that? 

00:50:30
SUSAN Takes a lot of energy to keep lifting myself up. 

00:50:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS When you're aware that there's blood on the floor. 

00:50:35
SUSAN Right. Right. 

00:50:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS So that there's a defiance, there's a saying, "I will live. I will reach up to the sky. I will breathe." 

00:50:45
SUSAN Yeah. 

00:50:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS "I will use the blood, in fact, as my ground." 

00:50:50
SUSAN Or "I will, I'm not even going to do the ground. I'm going to stick to water and air. I'm not even gonna," I mean, as I go on and on with my paintings, they're, the hell with the ground. I just, it's the open horizon. It's water and it's air. And sometimes I think, "I'm so sick to death of blue. I could puke I'm so sick of blue." And usually I put some mark of red in every painting. I was just telling someone who visited the studio yesterday that the key to the whole painting was this little spot of red that I had on the shoreline. 

00:51:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS When was the last time you felt something here? 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:45
SUSAN Well, when we started talking about dancing on blood. 

00:51:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. And what happened, what were you feeling? 

00:51:50
SUSAN I think a little bit afraid of that image. Yeah. Afraid of that, not of the image but afraid to go into it. 

00:52:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS (inaudible ) 

00:52:10
SUSAN Afraid to even speculate on it. Accusing myself and us, even, of contriving, of the luxury of doing this. 

00:52:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS What was the accusation of doing this? 

00:52:30
[sil.] 

00:52:35
SUSAN This is fun. It's wonderful to have all this attention. Maybe I don't deserve it. Maybe I've made all this up and I'm creating an intensity that isn't really in line. Terrible, terrible. 

00:53:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS Susan offers an enormously powerful image in her artwork. In fact, the entire treatment could be organized around the theme dancing on blood, for she offers really both her solution, her adaptation, as to how she copes with the bloodiness and power of her mother's influence. She refuses to be swallowed up. She wants air. She said, "I'll dance and I'll breathe in the air around me. I'll move." She has three legs for one, I think, is terribly attached to this blood, this blood that is a very poor ground. For her ground is not really on the earth. Mother Earth does not hold her. It is the air, it is the water, it is the defiance in her that says, "I will not be swallowed up," and yet, she's inextricably attached to this blood. And yet, it is an important part of she defines who she is. And it's very clear that she moves to the sky. Her hands are out, reaching up, but it is hard work, very hard work to constantly perform, to be out there, to be attentive to the world and not to submit, not to surrender to the power of this very important force. 

00:54:35
Later in Session 3 

00:54:40
SUSAN Well, I'd like to take the red away. I would like to take 

00:54:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS How would you do that? 

00:54:50
SUSAN Can't do it. 

00:54:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Oh, I'm not so sure about that. 

00:54:55
SUSAN Oh, you could paste over it. 

00:54:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS You could do many things if you wanted to. 

00:54:55
SUSAN Yeah, right, right, right. I could paste over it. 

00:55:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS So that the question, oh, we could do even more than that. We can even cut it out. 

00:55:05
SUSAN We can cut it out. We could cut it out. 

00:55:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS I'm not quite sure where you are in that. It would destroy what it is, this painting, if we started using scissors. And I don't know if you wanna do that. 

00:55:20
SUSAN I, there's a certain, no, I don't. There's two certain areas that I like a lot when I look at it. 

00:55:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS What's that? 

00:55:30
SUSAN That I'm perplexed by. This kind of area here that's all surrounded by fire. And when I did this, it was like these dots, like these dots that were little circles, like a centipede or a caterpillar or something like that. And then this area where it's muddy but it's lyrical and it's not afraid. It's not, it hasn't, it has movement. It has risk. It has a certain risk in it. And I would rather that there was risk than beauty. 

00:56:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS So let's take a risk. 

00:56:20
SUSAN Okay. 

00:56:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS Have you ever experimented in mixing the media, of poster paint and (inaudible )? 

00:56:30
SUSAN No. 

00:56:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS What do you think if we put some paper on top of this? 

00:56:35
SUSAN Yeah, fine. 

00:56:35
Later in Session 3 

00:56:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Let's see what happens. We go through something that is rather contrived. She covers over the art form and the ground seems to have been changed, but basically the psychic ground really remains the same. We have both concluded in a psychic trick to hide from us that the hard work still remains, for she soon goes away from what we have done and starts talking about all this performance takes so much out of her. Moving, working, and the impact of her mother just persecutes her. It is really takes a lot of work to not succumb to this very powerful force. And one of her devices is to become a performer. And if you were speaking to me from the earth right now and you were telling me you were dancing on blood, what goes on in there? 

00:57:55
SUSAN I would be afraid that I would cry. 

00:57:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yes. Right. 

00:58:00
[sil.] 

00:58:05
SUSAN Maybe all the time. 

00:58:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS All the time? 

00:58:10
SUSAN Yeah. 

00:58:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS So there's a very sharp pain because you have to dance on blood to survive. 

00:58:20
SUSAN I mean, I had to avoid it. 

00:58:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Had to avoid it. And that is a frightening image, a disturbing image. 

00:58:25
SUSAN I don't even know how I've done what I've done. I have no idea. And how I'm doing it. And this week I felt like, "My God, this is remarkable that I'm pulling this off," with the depth of feeling that I live with. 

00:58:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS And no one has said enough. I know it's been hard for you. You've got to deal with your mother's morose indictment of your life. Your father's a good man, and I'm not quite sure 

00:59:10
SUSAN He wouldn't stick up for us. He was on 

00:59:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Her side. 

00:59:15
SUSAN Absolutely. He would cover up for her no matter what. 

00:59:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS No matter what. 

00:59:20
SUSAN No matter what. No matter what. "Your mother loves you," "Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous. She loves you kids." 

00:59:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS So nobody really says you had been alone and you had to build it all on your own. And no one has said that it's been hard for you, often difficult. Yes, you've made it, but at a cost. I believe you were traumatized in a childhood. That I think you were alone, betrayed. No one said it was awful, living in that Holocaust or how when someone was using it. No one validated your own experience. It was very alone. And since no one has validated it, sometimes you wonder if it really existed. Sometimes you wonder if you were bullshitting yourself. 

01:00:15
SUSAN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:00:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Making it all up. But the tears that you are very close to are yours too. Yours too. And they're not from the air, they're not from the water, they're from the earth. And those tears are the heaviness of the burden. And I will bet you got unburdened this week. Just that you didn't have to perform. 

01:00:45
SUSAN Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I felt good that I felt not so happy. And I said, "There's an irony to the burden, to the happiness." Right? 

01:01:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay. Well, that's one thing right now. 

01:01:10
SUSAN I feel like I have to hold back a little 'cuz I feel like I could cry forever. 

01:01:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS And that has been the struggle here. Anybody who hears, sees that you were dancing on blood, my experience, my God, what a paralyzing image that is. 

01:01:30
SUSAN Yeah, and I'm just dancing around that. 

01:01:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS And you're dancing around 

01:01:30
SUSAN I'm dancing around that. Like, "Oh, that's interesting. Dancing on blood." Right. Right. 

01:01:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS Otherwise, you'd be full of tears, that this was hard and rough and difficult. Yes, you found a mechanism to live. We can get kind of reborn, in a way. 

01:01:55
SUSAN Yeah, from another place. Not from the earth. From another place. 

01:01:55
End of Session 3 

01:02:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS That's right. Susan discusses the power of this image. She does not really at times even take it seriously, dancing on blood. She's spoken a good deal about separation from her mother, but there is no hiding from this image, even though she tries to take it lightly, it is very difficult to take a full impact of this image inside of her, for she cannot escape it. At best, she can do is both defy it, redefine it, and run from it. And speaks eloquently about what her solutions in life have been. We see, therefore, that the image says much more than many of the words that she has applied both in her individual treatment as well as to herself. She cannot leave this mother, but she refuses to be absorbed in her life. 

01:03:05
Session 4 

01:03:10
SUSAN I thought it was kind of funny that after I started working, I realized that I had started on brown cardboard. I really enjoyed the cardboard. I really wondered to myself, "What do I want to work on?" and I saw this cardboard. I have a lot of packing material in my studio. And I liked the strongness of it and that I could easily transport it and that I knew it would do well with the tempera. And basically, all those thoughts, but I never thought for once that it was starting on a brown background. So immediately, that was like, "Hmmn. So, starting on the earth already." And there was, first I saw there was this mark in the cardboard, it was torn. And then I thought, "Oh, I could deal with that." And then I just cut it out. I'd say, "So there'll be a hole in it." And then I thought, "Well, I'll make another hole in it." And then it's almost like, and I was conscious that I didn't want to work as an artist. And I really feel that I heard very strong, there were very strong feelings about what colors I felt I wanted to start with. It's interesting that at a certain point, I need to start rubbing things out. I don't leave them as they are, that at a certain point in each thing that I've done, I wanna rub it all out, and then when I do, I'm sorry I did. But I 

01:04:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS When did that rub out take place in this? 

01:04:50
SUSAN Oh, all over, except these parts that are clear. 

01:04:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS I see. 

01:04:55
SUSAN And in some way, this one to me had a different, it started feeling to me like a kind of a circus or, yeah, like a circus. 

01:05:20
[sil.] 

01:05:25
SUSAN It started out all hot pink. 

01:05:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS Hot pink. 

01:05:25
SUSAN Hot pink, yeah, and then orange, and then yellow. 

01:05:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS What's happened here? 

01:05:40
SUSAN These are the tough questions. These are really the tough questions. 

01:05:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS What is going on in feeling-wise as you're speaking to me? 

01:05:50
SUSAN I'm feeling that it's tough questions. 

01:05:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Tough questions? 

01:05:50
SUSAN Yeah. And that is really a tough question. What is going on? I would say, nothing. I mean, that's terrible. I would say, nothing. I would say, I'm trying to look at this, and I'm saying 

01:06:10
ARTHUR ROBBINS Let me then ask you a question. We've had three very intense sessions. Is any of that overwhelming, to get so much coming at you, symbolically? We've given you a tremendous amount of stimulation. 

01:06:30
SUSAN Yeah. I like it. I mean, it feels also like a lot of wonderful attention or caring. 

01:06:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Do you ever reach a point where you feel too much? 

01:06:50
SUSAN That's interesting. I was feeling that all the way up here, but suddenly, I felt so tired. 

01:06:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yes. And I've been feeling your tiredness. 

01:07:00
SUSAN Oh, you're kidding. 

01:07:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS I'm feeling your tiredness. I'm feeling that you could almost go to sleep. 

01:07:05
SUSAN No. No, I'm not there. I'm not on the tired, I'm not in the tired, I'm not in the tired, go-to-sleep mode. I'm in the tired, little overwhelmed 

01:07:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS A little overwhelmed. 

01:07:15
SUSAN But I also feel that that's almost like something that wants to be dug through, that I don't necessarily feel that the answer, when I get in that zone, I don't necessarily feel that the answer to all that is just "go to sleep." 

01:07:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay. But do you ever get into a situation and say, "You know, I feel a little overwhelmed. I need some space"? 

01:07:45
SUSAN Rarely. Rarely. It's that inability for me to get in touch with how I feel. And that when I took the brush, it was almost like upon taking the brush, I lost touch with how I felt. And that's why I came here kind of goofed up because in some way, through the painting I almost lost touch. 

01:08:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS Right. Right. That's what I mean by "protection." Somebody hearing that you've had enough. Ease up. You'll come back. 

01:08:15
SUSAN See, I feel that's almost like a failure, like, "Oh" 

01:08:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS Rather than somebody just (inaudible ) your rhythm. Your rhythm 

01:08:30
SUSAN I feel like, "Oh, no time to lose! No, let's go, let's go, let's go." 

01:08:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Let's go, let's go. But then sometimes you get beaten up by "let's go, let's go." 

01:08:40
SUSAN Yeah, yeah. No, it's really true. It's really, really true. 

01:08:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Because I felt that we kept on pushing and pushing there. We feel that you've been beaten up from the exploration. We saw that you were using the red differently, that you were destroying it, that you changed your house. But we don't need such an intense exploration today. What you need is to be aware of how to protect yourself from overstimulation. See, I think your house was tremendously overstimulated by an impenetrable, indomitable demand from your mother to come close and consume you so you don't have air. But so much is coming at you that her whole recognition of your quiet space needs was not seen. In some respects, what I felt today was you had intensity. You moved everything around. You had a thing with the movers. You've used yourself up a lot. Why not respect that? Why not say, "Hey, can using art therapy be quiet and peaceful?" 

01:10:10
SUSAN It's interesting. That's why I'm thinking that, my initial feeling was warm, soothing, beautiful color. 

01:10:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS And maybe that's all it really needed. 

01:10:25
SUSAN But I couldn't do that. I felt somehow obliged to kick something out. 

01:10:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. And that kicking something out, but that's trying to produce a form for me. 

01:10:35
SUSAN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:10:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS And all you needed was one soothing color. Because that's really where your need was. 

01:10:45
SUSAN Right. 

01:10:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS Not kicking something out. Because if you kept kicking something out for me, I think somewhere you would have to run from this relationship because it'd be too much. Perform, perform, leave me alone already! 

01:11:10

End of Session 4 

01:11:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Not all art that is expressed by a patient reflects a self that is struggling to emerge. Some art is basically resistive in nature and covers up. In this session, it is quite apparent that Susan is not really engaged in this art form. She speaks very little about it. And in fact, a very telltale sign is when she comments that she has a tendency to cover over what she expresses and is reluctant about that. It is very indecisive. I wonder what she is covering over here. I also am aware that I am very tired in this session, and I wonder, am I picking up Susan's tiredness or really, are we, is the tiredness really basically a cut-offness as to what really is going on between us? And I comment and ask her if she's tired, and she tells me all the things she's been doing that day. Rearranging her studio, moving some of the white couches and chairs out, and goes into rather the fine details, all the troubles and problems. And she says, "I'm trying to find my own really expression of how I feel today." She's a mover. She moves and rearranges her house. She's done that a good deal in her life. But she had very little time do artwork today for this session. Really what she would like to have done, she confesses later on, is just to do a piece that is crimson red and nothing else. Just over and over again. And in fact, what she needed to do was to have this session that was much more meditative and quiet, less expressive, for one of the big problems of art therapy, it opens up a powerful lot of material at one time, symbolic material that often breaks through the defenses. And then the therapist must be alert to give that patient space and a certain degree of time to integrate, a certain degree of quiet to digest this material. And so if we are not alert to this, we may open and open and subtly set the stage for a good deal of resistance or indeed the patient may retreat completely from it, for too much has been opened up with not enough space for quiet, meditative center of just being. For if we are shaping an art form and expressing, we also need space to hope, to be, and allow meaning to find its own emergence in its time when we give ourself a space to really be connected to our center. And I believe this is what she was hungry for, this is what she needed to have mirrored, this is where we both were out of tune with one another. We learned a good deal of what she was searching for and she's often missed. 

01:14:40
Session 5 

01:14:45
SUSAN In other words, can you work, even though it's the unconscious, can you work literally? Can you work, like if I have an image in my mind that I wanna draw, can I do that and, can I do that? 

01:15:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS And what happened? 

01:15:05
SUSAN I just asked you a question. 

01:15:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS Can you do that, follow the image in your mind? 

01:15:10
SUSAN Yeah. I mean, in regard, can I do that and bring it in here and would that be something that we could work with? 

01:15:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS Why not? That's what you've been doing. 

01:15:20
SUSAN Well, only abstractly. 

01:15:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Ah. Only abstractly. 

01:15:25
SUSAN I mean, only through abstract, only through abstract color and 

01:15:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS You got something different now? 

01:15:35
SUSAN I do. Yeah. 

01:15:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Well, let's see. 

01:15:40
SUSAN Okay. It's the second one. And I will show you just so you see the sequence. So this is the first one. And I also decided that I would work on one that had a bluish background and then the next one that had an earth-tone background. And this is the second one. 

01:16:05
ARTHUR ROBBINS Okay. And? 

01:16:10
SUSAN And when I was doing this one, the odd thing is, when I was doing it, I remembered again a dream that I had last night and that when I woke up, I knew that, you know, sometimes when you know, I knew I was being fed something that was of particular importance for this evening. And then I lost complete track of it. I just completely blanked out on it. And then when I was drawing this, I remembered pieces of the dream. 

01:16:45
ARTHUR ROBBINS What were the pieces? 

01:16:45
SUSAN And the pieces were that the dream was something about a bar mitzvah of somebody in my family. I think it was my younger brother. And I remember my mother dressed for the occasion, and she was wearing some kind of silver and she was really hunched over and really small and hunched over, horrible. And I remember it was kind of spooky to see how hunched over she was. And then my whole family seemed so hunched over in this dream. But the second part that I remember vividly was that I was on some kind of, and I hadn't thought of the dream. This was the first image that I drew, this one. I hadn't thought of that. It was only until I drew this figure that I go, I'm like, "Oh, oh, this is this dream." Then I remember that the most perplexing part of the dream was that there was a loft and I was getting ready up in the loft to attend this bar mitzvah. And there was a ladder that I had to climb down from the loft down to the ground in order to go to this occasion. And the ladder, there was nobody there to stabilize the ladder. And I was really afraid. And every time I stepped on the ladder, I felt the base of the ladder shaky, I mean, I could not, maybe I could've. And I thought in the dream, I thought, "Well, if my weight is on the ladder, maybe that will stabilize it," but it was really. And I'm stuck up there. I was just stuck up there. And that was it. In some sense, like this figure is leaning on grass and water and really bending into the earth. And even, almost like an animal figure with the, like a fox or something, with a tail. But then I see also this thing that I thought was a ladder, I see it almost like railroad tracks. 

01:19:00
ARTHUR ROBBINS You're referring to the, yes. 

01:19:00
SUSAN This thing. And then later on, it became that thing. And I feel almost like a little bit of a sacrificial thing. That I didn't think about when I was doing it, like laying down on the railroad tracks. And this figure, which came later, much later in the drawing, almost looks as though it's pushing the head down. It's 

01:19:35
[sil.] 

01:19:40
SUSAN This bent, it's disturbing to me, the bent backs. Yeah. 

01:19:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Once again, we have the theme of the sacrifice. The sacrifice that is being made there and the bending, pushing that person down to the tracks. Okay. And there's this butterfly. Now, just tell me about your eye. Where does your eye first go to? 

01:20:10
SUSAN You know, it's funny. My eye goes right to that black. That's where my eye goes. Right to that center. How about you? 

01:20:25
ARTHUR ROBBINS So that, I could see where it would go. My first, my eyes are attracted to the brown, but there's something surface about that. It's too easy. So it goes over there. That's too easy to kind of find a center. Too obvious. It doesn't have the power of this. And you look at there, and then what happens? If you see that center and that center could speak, what does it make you feel like? 

01:20:50
SUSAN I think that center is an endless depth, that that center is like you would fall in but in a negative sense. Not in a negative sense. That you could 

01:21:10
[sil.] 

01:21:15
SUSAN It's funny. It's almost like looking down the spinal cord. 

01:21:15
ARTHUR ROBBINS And you go down and then what happens to you? Anything? Does your eye change? Does it stay there? 

01:21:25
SUSAN If I go down, no. You know where it goes? It goes up the ladder in some way. 

01:21:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS And then, does it stay up there, or does your eye move? 

01:21:45
SUSAN If I move with the drawing, is that what you're saying? 

01:21:50
ARTHUR ROBBINS Yeah. What does your eye do then? 

01:21:55
SUSAN It passes over the water and passes over this horrible, like a ghost 

01:22:05
[sil.] 

01:22:15
SUSAN Well, I could make my eye go somewhere. 

01:22:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS No, no. Just let it 

01:22:20
SUSAN No, it doesn't 

01:22:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS So it stays there in the loft. Or stays in those, whatever those are, tracks or whatever they could be. 

01:22:25
SUSAN Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it goes to the top. 

01:22:30
ARTHUR ROBBINS To the top. Okay. So you have here really two pictures. You have your something that is almost, like it's superimposed. That's there, but it's not really organic. It's something that's over there that's much more powerful. So I guess there is a kind of a way we may find a ladder, but the fact is that you may have to kind of take a good look and say, "Hey, that really may be me." More than this stuff over here. And I ask you a question, who sees the butterfly in you? Who sees 

01:23:15
SUSAN Who sees the butterfly? I see the butterfly in me. 

01:23:20
ARTHUR ROBBINS Who else? (inaudible )? Who sees this? 

01:23:25
SUSAN (inaudible saw the butterfly. 

01:23:35
ARTHUR ROBBINS Ah, your soul mate. 

01:23:35
SUSAN Yes. Very much. I think that's why, really. Oh, boy. 

01:23:40
ARTHUR ROBBINS And he knew something. 

01:23:40
SUSAN Yes, he did. He really did. He really did. He saw it. He didn't necessarily honor the delicacy of it, but it saw it. But he saw it. Absolutely. 

01:23:55
End of Session 5 

01:23:55
ARTHUR ROBBINS So he had the perceptiveness to see it, but he didn't know how to honor it. So that's really what you keep on saying to me. See that kind of delicate kind of butterfly in me so that it's honored. It's not squashed, but it's honored. One of the most moving parts of the session, when we spoke who saw this butterfly was her first husband who had the soul of an artist and in many respects was her soul mate. But though he saw it, he could not honor it. This was equally true of her second husband. And so we come now to the essence, really, of these five sessions. We first meet Susan dancing, dancing on blood. Her peace, and so this is in her artwork where she's part of the air, part of the water, and she watches the world, the theater on the pier, go on before her, the dawn of something new. But we also are aware of how self-destructive she can be in her relationships. And in this art piece, we see all the potential for her being hurt, for her being put in a submissive position, for the entire family constellation bowing their heads and their bodies and is ready for the slaughter. A ritual of sacrifice for the family. But the true essence has not really been mirrored, and we see it in the art form. It's easy for your eye to go to the center there, to see this figure that is lying down. But the complexity, the soul, the soul really is in that center of the piece where it goes up. And when I ask her if we took away those pieces in the middle, she said, "Yes, I don't know why I put them there. Because I value simplicity." And of course, butterflies, then, are part of the air. They're not really part of the earth, but really have a beauty that needs to be honored, a fragility. They are regenerative, beautiful specimens, for they bring to the world a constant pollination of life. This is the essence of this woman that we have seen make in such a short, contracted time some of the most powerful images that one would have been hard put to find in terms of a more traditional verbal therapy relationship. She brings to me the images of her defense, the places that she hides, the places, even, where the energy of the picture stops, where the energy gets too cluttered with those people lying down. And we see how powerful it is and how it shapes her and shakes, which anybody to see the image of dancing on blood. We are able to view how both therapist and patient could subtly be part of a transference and countertransference interchange even in art where the trauma, both parties could collude in covering over and finding easy methods to get out or working through this very difficult family situation. So that what we see here in the art therapy relationship are multiple levels of consciousness. Transference projections that she has to perform for me. We see the image of the self and the soul, which is the source of her energy. We see where the energy gets locked up. We understand better why she is so reluctant to move in the session, for I thought this would be for her a piece of cake, but it isn't. For movement was an area where she was confined rather than released. There was not a transition to life. Art has been that transition, a very profound transition. And so the honoring of masculinity for a boy or femininity for the woman is now symbolized in the problems here for this patient. She sees her brother moving into this transition. For her there was no transition, for indeed, she is constantly have to fight the locked-in relationship with her mother who carries on the images of the Holocaust and says, "Do you dare live when I gave up so much for you?" We see richness in this woman and her colors and space. We can see that sometimes she can be over-elaborative and not really find the essence of who she is. This is the butterfly that constantly she sees in her garden in Florida that gives her peace, that is magnetic, that has its own life and its own beauty. And as she says, "Will I find somebody who can mirror this for me?" And I say back, "It is up to you now to protect that butterfly and honor it as well."
