Dr. Flora Taylor, Consultant 

00:00:10
DR. MARY MCRAE We live in a multicultural world. Where tribal loyalties often force people to compete for roles of leadership and power. When we interact with others from racial, ethnic and cultural groups that are different from our own it can create tension and stress. Our values, beliefs and our hidden assumptions about the other seem to clash at the boundaries where we met.. This is particularly true when we have had few interactions with others outside of regular or familiar social identity group. Confrontation and tension create stress that often leads to what we call fight or flight behavior in groups and organizations. What if we say the wrong thing. What if we offend when we intend to engage. What happens when we think we are politically correct. Yet are experienced by others as not. The purpose of this video is to develop awareness and understanding of racial, ethnic and cultural dynamics that occur in groups and organizations. To acknowledge rather than ignore or deny racial, ethnic and cultural tensions. To discuss and work openly with racial, ethnic and cultural tensions. And to identify the other in ourselves as a way of understanding those who are different from us. The small study group in this video met for four one hour sessions during a weekend group relations conference. It is a group of 12 members. Kelley, Mary, Patrick, John, Ming-Hui who is called Daniel by the members. Monique, Jack, Maritza, Nathan, George, Arthur and Olga. The consultant to this group is Dr. Flora Taylor. The consultant’s role is to observe, and to make interventions that speak to the conscious and unconscious processes that are occurring in the group as a whole in the here and now of the moment. The task of the group is to study its own behavior as it emerges. The group relations conference model is grounded in psychoanalytic and systems theories. Dr. Mary McCray has found cultural relational theory drawn from the psychoanalytic tradition to be the most helpful in understanding how we connect and disconnect with one another when relating across differences. Both interpersonally and in groups. Embedded intergroup theory helps us to understand the interactions of multicultural groups. By focusing on power differences, boundaries and roles that may influence cognitive and affective behaviors in a given social context.

00:03:25
Check Feelings 

00:03:25
Feedback 

00:03:25
DR. MARY MCRAE The group relations model of experiential learning involves lowering the barriers to the expression of feelings. Both friendly and hostile. It provides continuous opportunities to check on one’s own feelings about given situations. And to compare these feelings with those of others. This allows participants to give voice to what may be unspeakable in other settings. Now, as you watch the first session and vignette, observe the members visible characteristics. Such as race, ethnicity, gender and age. What is the racial, ethnic, gender, age and cultural makeup of this group. What is the racial, ethnic, age and cultural background of the consultant. How are the members seated in terms of race, ethnicity, gender and age. Do you see any patterns. Who speaks first and how is the member responded to. Next, see if you observe any stereotypes or hidden assumptions being attributed to members. Consider, race, ethnicity, gender and age. If you have difficulty with this, consider the stereotypes you have seen ascribed to people from similar backgrounds on TV, in the movies, and other forms of media. Our pull to be politically correct can keep us in denial of strong emotions that can be enacted in group and organizational life. 

00:05:10
[sil.] 

00:05:20
KELLEY I must say that, I found the way we became a group to be quite interesting. 

00:05:30
MARY Why was it so interesting? 

00:05:30
Kelley 

00:05:30
KELLEY The way in which people – some people were very indecisive to become a part of this group. Crossed their names out. Uh, and then wrote their names back on the list. Um, and most – mostly surprised that the way Mary became a part of this group. Um, she saw the first opportunity, actually, someone scratched off their name, Mary put hers on. Um, so she was in the – originally not a part of this group. But became one. And I felt that was very powerful. 

00:06:10
Nathan 

00:06:10
NATHAN I thought it kind of odd because I was one of those waiverer people. And I crossed my name off and then felt a pull to – like, I sign up for another group. Then felt a pull to this group. And I don’t know what it was, a reason why I put my name back on it was like a loyalty to this group that I didn’t feel to the other group. Which is strange because I didn’t – don’t know hardly anyone here. And I had already introduced myself to the other group. So, I’m a little confused as to why I came back. 

00:06:40
OLGA Well, I feel a lot of anxiety sitting here in this chair, in the group, especially being videotaped. And, um, I wonder if talking about how we grouped saves us from this anxiety. Or is it normal to go through this stage of being in anxiety and then just relaxed, just talking about something. For me it’s a lot of anxiety right now. 

00:07:10
Monique 

00:07:10
MONIQUE  I felt, I am still feeling a little scared in this room. And I felt the first opportunity that I had to get out of the group I kind of jumped for it. When no one was willing to leave, because we had 13 people, I kind of put myself to the front, okay, I’ll leave. But then my – um, Mary came and she said, why – why are you leaving. Which then – it was a fight between I really – I’m scared. But I want to overcome that fear. And then there was Mary to back that up and say, well stay. So that was kind of like my confirmation to stay in this group. 

00:07:55
John 

00:07:55
JOHN I am – I’m wondering if there is, uh, an – an unconscious attraction for some people to difference. Because this group was the difference of this group is that it’s being taped. And everyone out there knows it. 

00:08:20
Maritza 

00:08:20
MARITZA It’s also, I think a desire for structure. Because for me, I think part of it is some kind of laziness. If I leave this group I have to go to talk to different groups. Find out where my affinity is. And that seems like to be a lot of work. And this actually has already provided structure for me. The fact that I’m already being included in this group. 

00:08:40
Patrick 

00:08:40
PATRICK Now that’s interesting, that comment. Because even though there’s anxiety I thought – my assumption was when people signed up everyone would just say, sure, I’ll be part of – I don’t care. And then you tell me here and they’re saying maybe not quite so many felt that way. And then why not. And I started to second guess myself. And then did that. And that’s when the fear came. And I thought, no, no, no, it’s a fear thing that’s not fair. De-tick myself. Better to stay on it. 

00:09:05
Mary 

00:09:05
MARY When I realized that there was going to be only one group, uh, that would be videotaped. It was an attraction to me. And, um, I was adamant that I was going to be in the group. And, um, part of what made me feel adamant had to do with the fact that there was more – more people than spaces. And so the thought that there’s going to be some people leaving, um, made me feel so there was an opportunity. But the minute that I heard that there was jockeying that – to be had I felt as though, hey, if – if some people are going that means somebody can come. And I was determined that I was going be somebody that would be there. 

00:10:05
Dr. Taylor 

00:10:05
DR. FLORA TAYLOR Even as we explore the dynamics around the formation and there are some references to the videotaping. So no one has yet said what videotaping might be desirable. And why you want to be in a group that’s being videotaped. I think that there are also some relational elements that have something to do with your choosing to be here. And I wonder if we might explore those. And explicate them so that we’re all on the same page. 

00:10:35
Please pause the video now 

00:10:35
to take a moment 

00:10:35
to make your own interpretation 

00:10:35
of the seating of the group. 

00:10:35
DR. MARY MCRAE What did you observe in the seating arrangement? Did you notice that the two younger African American members are sitting together? There is one older white male who seems to have a previous relationship with Mary. Sitting between the two black women. Most of the other white men are grouped together. The two Asians are distributed between the black and white members. What interpretations do you make about the seating of the group. The seating arrangement could be interpreted as unconscious boundaries. Which have been formed by the members to protect themselves from the anxiety of being in a new group. We each find comfort in infinity groups. And initially, members only have visual and intuitive notions about each other. In this session, the members begin by discussing how the group formed and what motivated them to join. Some members talk about their feelings of anxiety, competition and fears about joining the group. In this vignette race and gender dynamics surface as the members reveal bits of themselves. Mary takes on the role of the strong black woman. Competitive and determined. Olga, holds the anxiety and vulnerability often ascribed to white women. Maritza presents herself as wanting the structure provided for her. She may be perceived by the group as being passive. A stereotype of ascribed to Asian women. John, the older white man takes up the role of consultant. These are stereotypical roles that members of different racial ethnic groups often take up unconsciously. Most of us tend to take up roles in groups that are similar to the ones we hold in our families and at work. For instance, John, a middle aged white man has worked as an executive in charge of others. This is also true for Mary. A black woman executive who has worked in predominately white organizations. Sometimes in groups white women may hold the emotional sensitivity while Asian women who in other settings might be strong minded, may behave more passively. We each have a tendency of valence to unconsciously take up certain stereotypical roles in groups. It is the power of the group experience. What role do you tend to take up in groups. Especially as it relates to your race, ethnicity, culture, gender, age, social class, sexual orientation, and educational or occupational status. What stereotypes or hidden assumptions do others have of you. Do you typically feel authorized in the roles you take up in educational or work groups. See if you can find other racial and cultural dynamics in the vignette. In culturally diverse groups, members often look for commonalities. And are cautious about noting their differences. Members also attempt to find the role they will take up in the group. In this vignette, the consultant asked members to consider why they signed up for the group. And to explore their fantasies about themselves and about the consultant. 

00:14:20
Dr. Taylor 

00:14:20
DR. FLORA TAYLOR So it does seem though, it’s harder to talk about the relational aspect then to talk about the communicative. 

00:14:30
[sil.] 

00:14:35
Olga 

00:14:35
OLGA I wonder if there is anything about this group that makes more comfortable then others group. But, still I agree that I might have taken the anxiety but because the first thing that I said that I feel a lot of anxiety. And I might take that, you know, project identification of yours. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Um-hmm. 

00:14:50
OLGA But, you know, I feel much more comfortable right now talking about it then I did. So, I – you know, I don’t want to stick with one role and being dispersed and who takes the anxiety of the group. But I tender – I mean, my – I’m – my personality is like that. That I am very emotional and I feel very – I’m very sensitive to what people say. Even unverbally. I might not understand like 100 percent. But, I feel like I do feel a lot. 

00:15:20
DR. FLORA TAYLOR  Well, if we’re to access the unconscious, we might consider looking at the fantasies that members have brought into this room. So for example, it seems to me that there are some members, perhaps, who, um, for whom this is an audition. So if one thinks about whom would you tape in the future, one could be seen as auditioning for that audience. That’s one possibility. At the same time it can also be true that one is here for the learning of those who would come after our group. It can also – you know, a number of – any number of things are – are possible. But there are, I think, some fantasies at work around your presence here in this room, vis a vis the videotaping. Knowing that it’s there to talk about your presence here vis a vis me and my role. 

00:16:20
John 

00:16:20
JOHN One of the reasons I’m here is because I’m at a place in my career where I’m thinking about what I’m going to do next. And I have a fantasy of doing consulting, something along the clinical psychology consulting group relations access – axis. And when you made that observation it dawned on me that if I – if this – if I – if this plays itself out, this videotape is going to be around for a long time. And it could, uh – it could be something that I don’t want around. And I want the – when I grew, I’m 56. And when I grew up I was, you know, white men rule the world. And, uh – and I carry all that with me. And I know that other people feel they have to defend against that. But I also have the feeling of being, uh, like the last Quaker. That uh, what I am is, uh, the – the ball of the curves are going to invert in my lifetime. And I am not in the assent. And, uh, in – in this moment I’m kind of feeling I’m barely conscious. Need to figure all this out. Because I’m going to have to live in it. 

00:18:05
Arthur 

00:18:05
ARTHUR I – I, uh, having come to New York, um, from living in the south, I, uh, have – I’ve been in a very liberal area, liberal family. And I’ve had some, um – some amount of experience outside my box. But, not really. And I especially am feeling that this year, since I came to New York and started studying, um, and what you said is, you know, what you don’t know – what you don’t know is what gets you to think. Um, I get – I miss the point a lot. I know that. And I – I hear that from other people. Especially and, um, so I think I – I did have a bigger voice in this group. Um, if I can just say that right now that I – I might mess up, or I might say things from a perspective that I – isn’t sharing. Um, but that, um, the reason I’m here is to figure out the why of myself. Um, or just quiet my ability to – to deal with other people. Um, so I hope I can do that. 

00:19:25
Mary 

00:19:25
MARY I’m extremely touched by what you said. Uh, it feels very important to me to hear white men talking about their interests in learning about difference. And, um, I am – identify also with, um – uh, what John said about being older. And I’m older than you. And, uh, I – that too is a part of being excited that in my lifetime I can actually, um, hear -- hear from different people. And talk very directly. And that’s exciting. 

00:20:15
DR. MARY MCRAE Three white members speak the most in this vignette. Olga wants to the group to know that she is aware of her role and strong enough to manage it. She is calling for a collaborative process in the group. John and Arthur speak to their own vulnerability in their roles as white men. John, who is used to having a certain amount of power and control is concerned about being a white older man in a group and world where this could all change. Arthur is wondering if the group is a safe enough place for him to make mistakes and to learn. What will happen if he makes a mistake and says something that will hurt someone’s feelings. There is a pull to connect around commonalities within and across race gender and age lines. This is demonstrated in the interaction between Arthur and John. Which is within gender and between generations. It is also evident between Mary and Arthur, a cross race, age and gender. What other dynamics did you observe in this vignette. In this next vignette the group deals with its first conflict. Remember, when members become anxious they often go into the fight or flight mode of behaving. See if you can identify the roles of those engaged in the conflict. What is the race, ethnicity, gender and age of each of those members. 

00:21:55
George 

00:21:55
GEORGE When I went to – to lunch I realized we never really got to introduce anyone. And so, I don’t know, I just thought it’d be nice to the – if we knew, you know, who each other are. I don’t know. I just, uh, thought that might interested if people were comfortable doing something like that. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Would you like to start? 

00:22:15
GEORGE Sure. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Talking about yourself. 

00:22:15
GEORGE Yeah. I’ll start. Um, well I’m – my name is George. And I’m at teacher’s college. Um, I’m master student in my first year. Um, I’m getting married next year and I just got a puppy. And that’s pretty much it. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN You’re next. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Only if you want. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Go in order. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Go ahead. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:40
Jack 

00:22:40
JACK Um, I’m Jack. And I’ll say that much. But I also think that, we could spend 20 minutes talking about ourselves and the task of learning in the here and now talking about that stuff. Might give us a sense of intimacy and comfort that we don’t have now. But maybe being with the discomfort and fear and hope of encountering people beyond just our biographical fence might – might be another way to -- 

00:23:10
GEORGE That’s true. 

00:23:10
JACK -- do it. 

00:23:10
GEORGE Yeah. Yup. You know, speak next about something else. Not that. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:35
Monique 

00:23:35
MONIQUE I’m feeling uncomfortable right now. Because this young man wanted to know who – who we were. And maybe not know exactly in-depth. But just to know a name to tie a name to the person we see in the chair or the face that we see. And I feel by you shutting him down it kind of shut down the whole, uh – well at least for me it kind of shut it off, like, we really don’t know one another, who you are. You just want to know their experience. What you’re feeling right now. 

00:24:10
Mary 

00:24:10
MARY And if that was – and thinking about the fact that, um, when we were grouped – trying to get the group together you offered yourself as sacrifice to me. Someone else keep from being uncomfortable. And sounds as though at this point you’re again, offering yourself to keep somebody from being uncomfortable. 

00:24:40
MONIQUE I feel like I’m often offering myself for someone else, um, just because I don’t mind to take the hit. I can take the blow. And it doesn’t hurt me as much. And even though I don’t know this young man from him or anything, but it’s just, you know, okay. He wanted that experience to know who everyone else was. And he was offered that. 

00:25:05
JACK And so, awkward kind of saying it. Any yet when you – because even in that direction I kind of imagined my own blood pressure raising. 

00:25:15
GEORGE Yeah. 

00:25:15
JACK As everyone went around and doing something that, you know, that could very easily take us a good bit of time. And – and I think well, we’re – we’re relating. And – and maybe – maybe we can learn – maybe there are other – maybe there are other ways to learn who we are and – and not only who you are but who I am. For me. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Made an assumption that if the – if it would go this way that everybody would have introduced themselves. 

00:25:45
Kelley 

00:25:45
KELLEY You also made the assumption that no one else is getting or at least learning from this experience which, um, I beg to differ. 

00:26:00
Nathan 

00:26:00
NATHAN Well, I think also, but on that same end, um, you made the assumption that everyone was kind of anxious and uncomfortable. And needed to introduce themselves. 

00:26:10
GEORGE Oh yeah. And -- 

00:26:10
NATHAN And I guess that, you know, could be true. But -- 

00:26:10
GEORGE Yeah. Well – yeah, I definitely – I kind of made that assumption. I – you know, usually just go by my gut. And I just think that human beings, like – you know, and I could be totally wrong. But if you don’t know each other, it just – you know, it’s just a way of just kind of, you know. If I – if I know more about you I probably, you know, care more about, you know, your behalf, your – your well being. Um, I think that people do feel comfortable though, I think in – you know, future situations if I was, like, a facilitator I would probably – I don’t know, ask people, like, when they do speak, feel comfortable to speak, you know, it wouldn’t hurt if they would – you know, if they want to introduce themselves. You know, to any degree. Like, I think a name’s not too – I think a name could – isn’t asking too much. But they could, you know, could ask more, you know. Would have been honest to play it from there. But -- 

00:27:00
Dr. Taylor 

00:27:00
DR. FLORA TAYLOR But your take on the dynamics so far, um, would be that members who did not bring their voices to the first group managed to bring their voices to this one. And that has certainly represents some joining and some willingness on the part of the group as a whole to work differently. Yet another take is that younger members started this session. And that older members were adding some caution to the way in which the younger members joined. Because as if maybe generations is one of the dynamics that’s up in our group. 

00:27:35
Daniel 

00:27:35
MING-HUI I know this like to – I notice that this, uh, group is kind of mature group. In that positive sense. And physiologically I – I noticed that our group is kind of mature. So I kind of saw that, uh, a little bit of – I don’t know of it’s conflict but, potentially conflict between different generation. In terms of, you know, other things to think about things and their experiences. 

00:28:05
DR. MARY MCRAE As pointed out by the consultant, the issue of age or the generational gap surfaces between younger and older members of the group. The first conflict is between two white men of different generations. Jack and George. Monique the younger black woman steps in to defend George, the younger white male. But is stopped by Mary, the older black woman. Who points out that Monique is offering herself for sacrifice yet again. As a black woman, Monique could be perceived as taking a maternal role of caring for the young white man. Mary comes from a generation of Civil Rights and black struggle. Where black women were able to step out of the role of the domestic care taker. She encourages Monique to not take up the stereotypical maternal role. Monique seems to have little awareness of this racial dynamic that seems so present for Mary. This is an important intra-racial difference. However, they connect as black women with generational differences. There is also an intra-racial and generational dynamic between two white men, Jack and George. Monique connects with George across race, intra-generational dynamic. If we were to draw a grid we would see racial and age generational connections as well as disconnections. Another connection to note is that made by Daniel when he agrees with the consultant. From a cultural perspective, it could be that he is demonstrating his respect and reverence for authority. It could also be that he is trying to define a role for himself in the group. One of the most difficult things for multicultural group members is being authentic. Members are fearful of being labeled as racist, sexist, homophobic, or as having some bias that will shame them in the group. Members come with their own distinct personalities, attitudes, and assumptions. Each has multiple social identities, such as race, ethnicity, age and cultural values. In this vignette see if you can identify where members are looking for connections across race, gender and age. Which members reach out? How are they responded to? 

00:30:40
Maritza 

00:30:40
MARITZA  What I’m reacting to, personally, is, um, I think – I don’t know if there’s assumption here, mean that after you spoke that I – you turned to me but I didn’t speak afterwards whether that shutting down or whether I’m not participating in, you know, this idea of yours. Actually what was going on my mind was that I’m struggling with this identity issue. I guess I’m going to be related to what I say. Some people here are students and some of us, like, you know, full time jobs. And I’m not just stroking my mind, like, which part of me is here. You know, I am enrolled in the organization dynamic story, new dynamics career. But why – and those with I, daytime I’m a marketer. I’m in cosmetics industry. And I pursue a whole bunch of other interests. And I don’t know who I’m – when I’m talking about my ethnicity, you know, like my upbringing. And I just didn’t know which piece of mine am I actually present. 

00:31:35
Patrick 

00:31:35
PATRICK But I was thinking who am I. I mean, the easy thing to say I’m a white male that’s – but I don’t get some of the complexity of where I’m really from back there. And then it led me to the point of how do I identify myself as this living in partners, the Polish part. How is the Catholic – what – what do I identify. And then how do I bring it to the group or do I not. You know, do I kind of let that go and just kind of like take cover in the broader, like, male thing. And I – that might be cope out a little bit. I don’t know. But I – I feel that, that dawned on me. I think for the first time. 

00:32:10
MONIQUE I found myself often throughout the day trying to struggle with that. I’m an African American, female. As far as ethnicity goes. But as far as, um, who I am and what do I do. Part time worker, full time student, um, child – child, you know, things like that, I – I think I identify more with. Than I don’t see the identity, which may be – I don’t really see – I guess I could go into why I don’t – earlier when we talked about other – about race. I was in my own mind ready to get off the subject. I think that’s what it is. I tried to brush it to the side, like, okay. As a way to, let’s get over it. Like a – I feel like that’s a – um, that we use often. So I try to quickly move that and discuss something else. 

00:33:15
Nathan 

00:33:15
NATHAN  I feel like because maybe – it seems like I think you eluded to it, like, there’s an issue with discomfort for you guys. Like, to get away from it. Like, there’s an need to get away from it. Like, um -- and then you just talk about race being a speed bump. And how it’s best to just walk – um, I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but, maybe brushing that aside. Like, I don’t know if there’s maybe something we can learn from feeling uncomfortable. Like perhaps we aren’t very comfortable sitting in a circle right now. Because we haven’t introduced ourselves, maybe. I don’t know. But is that okay. Because I – you know, is it okay to feel discomfort and uncomfortable and attack some of these complex issues. 

00:34:05
Arthur 

00:34:05
ARTHUR That really resonated with what you said. Because um, I think that’s it. Like, I’m – I’m very unsure about, um, what I’m supposed – who – what part of me I’m supposed to bring to this group. You know, because I – as you were saying that I have lots of parts of me. Um, but what – what part is meaningful for this group. And what part is meaningful to me in order to be in this group. And what do I need to be – and then what do other people need me to be. And that I – I really don’t know. And I don’t feel like really, uh, anybody’s put me kind of, um, guidelines out there. 

00:34:55
DR. MARY MCRAE Race is often the most difficult difference to talk about in mixed race groups. The group often acts as if black members are the only ones who could talk about race. Which can be frustrating and a huge responsibility. Monique seems to be asking if others can connect with her as a person rather than just her race. Nathan subtly asks if people could deal with the discomfort around race and potentially other issues of difference. Patrick speaks to the complexity of this situation. Arthur is looking for the rules of engagement or a group norm. And who has the authority to set and manage them. Is the group a safe enough place for members to discuss and work with their differences. Will the consultant, who is a black woman be there for all members. Regardless of their backgrounds. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
DR. MARY MCRAE In the next vignette, the group engages in more conflict. Observe which members attempt to set the rules for time boundaries. What are the racial stereotypes or assumptions being made. What are the racial dynamics related to power, gender and age. Do members take roles similar or different from the roles held by others of similar racial and cultural backgrounds in our society. 

00:36:30
Patrick 

00:36:30
PATRICK It – it’s kind of that if we’re able to do it. And I feel it happens with the dynamic – me included, is that it, um – that, uh, the moment passes. And I don’t offer in that moment that this is like how I feel based on what you just said. You know, and – that feels to me like our struggle. We’re behind the moment a little bit. We’re talking about, um – I don’t know if that makes sense. But it feels like that to me. Like we’re pulling in – the conversation comes out of it. We were right here, now the truth is like for example, you came in late, Monique. And I thought, how people come in late. And you came in late, Mary and I thought how can we now to tell you this. This is wrong. I should have said in the moment you guys are late, called you. And then we move on. You know. And so that’s an example. I’m just providing an example what it is I’m talking about, the dynamic and trying to -- 

00:37:15
MARY Well now that you’ve brought up the fact that I came late, what did it mean to you. 

00:37:20
PATRICK What did it mean? I think what I – what I thought when it happened was if we’re in an environment where we can share and where people have already expressed their feeling of anxiety and vulnerability, to disrespect – I would view that as disrespect by coming in late. Then, you know, what does that say about the group. What’s the message to the group by coming in late. So I mean – I mean that lead somehow -- 

00:37:45
Mary 

00:37:45
MARY I guess my question is, what did my coming in late mean to you, personally. 

00:37:50
PATRICK It meant a disrespect of that thing that we had talked about before, about this is a space where, um, we should be able to share – or experience and we’ve explained we feel vulnerable. Um, and there was the attack we’re using there too. And so it was just an act that wasn’t certainly – didn’t feel aggressive to me. But it felt, uh, dis -- it disacknowledged us. It did not acknowledge that particular thing at the moment. That’s how I saw it. And I didn’t say anything until now. And I’m disappointed in myself that I didn’t. 

00:38:25
MARY I’d encourage you to say something as soon as you see – hear something or -- 

00:38:30
PATRICK But I don’t need your encouragement to say that. I mean, I know that I can say that. 

00:38:35
MARY And I would indeed you’re talking about me. I’d like hearing it at the time. 

00:38:40
PATRICK Which is what I’m telling you. That’s my fault. 

00:38:45
MARY In the future you have my permission to say that. 

00:38:45
PATRICK I don’t need your permission, Mary. I don’t need your permission. 

00:38:50
MARY Well you have it. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:39:05
Arthur 

00:39:05
ARTHUR I really want, um, someone to give me permission. Uh, when you said that I realized – damn I’ve been waiting for somebody to say that to me. But then if someone said that to me, I’d have the exact same reaction. I don’t need your permission. I need to be able to say in this group. I don’t need permission. Um, but I would like acknowledgement. And I don’t know what I need permission to do or to be. Um, maybe to be – maybe to help my hold my identities better in this group. I don’t know. I don’t feel safe that – that, um, that I can do that and, uh, I’m doing it for the right reasons. 

00:39:50
Dr. Taylor 

00:39:50
DR. FLORA TAYLOR I’m wondering how some of the things that are happening are related to the taping. If – if they are. I experienced some of what has gone on here is basically the assumption fight. So then in service of what is the next question. If that in fact, is the case. Is it to avoid some other anxiety that’s here and if so is taking part of the anxiety or is something else. Um, certainly the competition has been – made many people have gotten on board with that idea. 

00:40:20
Daniel 

00:40:20
MING-HUI I want to take a risk, uh, I want to ask, um, Mary and Monique, um, because you two were late coming. And I was wondering – I want to – my goal is to – that more understanding of you too. Because I – I kind of – I think I kind of pay attention – I mean, I – I had noticed there are two empty chairs at the beginning. But I kind of realized I have some feelings about it too. And – so – and but that I want to hear about your perspective too, um. And since you say you – you’ve felt like being rejected or you felt, uh, not respected or so. And so, I wonder like would you be comfortable telling us why you were late. 

00:41:05
MARY Um, I – I could tell you but I didn’t say that I felt rejected. 

00:41:10
MING-HUI I’m sorry that was my words. Yes. 

00:41:15
Mary 

00:41:15
MARY And it wasn’t that at all. I – I felt it’s been – it was a white man again telling me what I should be doing. And so I was reacting to that. And actually what happened is, I was here early and I went to the bathroom. And the stalls were filled. People so angry, didn’t until it was my turn. Well maybe now I anticipate it. And I – I really didn’t feel apologetic about that. I reacted to his approach as well as his physical being. And it stirred some stuff up for me. And – and I think it’s stirred up the stuff that I had experienced when I was waiting out – when I was trying to become a part of this group. When another white man said to me, you shouldn’t do that. And so it was the two things that was combined with my history that caused me to react like that. 

00:42:25
Monique 

00:42:25
MONIQUE I personally don’t feel like I owe an apology or I owe an explanation for my lateness. Because I feel like, in any case it could have been you that was late. But in my mind I’m thinking, who are you to say all of that. What gives you the authority to tell this woman that that was a disrespectful. Because you don’t – I think what was disrespectful was the issue of you telling her she was disrespectful. 

00:42:50
Dr. Taylor 

00:42:50
DR. FLORA TAYLOR This – this is a – this is an experience in which we are gathered to study authority. Both personal authority and conferred authority. And we are in fact – we are studying the unconscious last time I checked. And so we might actually look at our unconscious and see whether or not there was unconscious planning involved. But, is one really late completely by accident or could there be more to be understood about it. Is it possible that our unconscious are at work here. In this moment. And what would happen if we lifted off the lid and took a look at what our conscious is saying. It might be interesting. 

00:43:35
DR. MARY MCRAE Patrick is attempting to engage in an authentic dialog. Where he tells the two black women they were late. He has waited until the end of this session to say something. He does not seem to be aware of how his race and gender might impact Mary. Who appears to be offended by his assumptions. This is a race and gender dynamic. Monique steps in to help Mary. Arthur steps in to help Patrick. The two younger members seem to support the member representing their racial and gender group. However, Monique and Arthur focus more on authority than race. Making this not only about race and gender but also creating a generation dynamic. Daniel, the male Asian member takes up a role of mediator in the group. Asian, Latino American and recent immigrants often find themselves in the middle or on the outside of racial conflicts between white and black members. It is important to keep in mind that these dynamic processes occur simultaneously within and across race, ethnicity, gender and generation. Some, being more salient than others due to situation, and context. The consultant’s reference to the study of the unconscious is a call for the group to consider its task. Perhaps the black women unconsciously enacted a racial stereotype of lateness on behalf of the group’s need to defy the authority of the black woman consultant. Both in the group and in the conference over all. We call this process projective identification. The two black women may have unconsciously taken in projections of lateness. Racial attitudes are deeply imbedded in both white and black Americans, due to our history of enslavement. And we are prone to enactment of those underlying feelings and hidden assumptions in group and organizational life. In many groups where people of color are in the minority, they tend to be the target of the most negative projections. While whites tend to take on more positive projections. Differences such as race, ethnicity, gender, age sexual orientation, religion and disability are an integral aspect of interpersonal and group interactions. These factors become a part of the dynamic processes in the group. Especially when we consider the individual and group’s desire for survival. Sometimes in groups we play out familiar roles that we take up in our daily lives. Women and men may take up gender roles, similar though those they hold at home and community. Identify the dynamics in this next vignette. 

00:46:40
KELLEY Sorry I’m late. 

00:46:45
Jack 

00:46:45
JOHN I feel like I’d like to really open some up. But the last comment yesterday about, sort of aggression or whatever it was, sort of turning up the volume of some of the differences in here. Differences of opinion we have, differences of experience and – and it feels like the lateness is kind of, you know, differences of arrival times. Differences of respecting a time boundary by everyone decide not to show up this morning. Um, and it’s kind of over statement but it feels like it means something that -- 

00:47:15
Mary 

00:47:15
MARY I’m just wondering, what it’s so meaningful to you and why it feels as though it – it seems like it’s your job to keep people doing what they need to do – or how – how it fits the role and reaction to that. 

00:47:30
JOHN I don’t think it’s my job to keep them -- 

00:47:30
MARY Well -- 

00:47:30
JOHN -- to keep people doing – I guess they’re –we’re given freedom and authorization within space boundaries, time boundaries and role boundaries. As the only rules. 

00:47:45
MARY Well I guess what I’m saying is that it seems as though the issue has come from you several times about what needs to be done. And so, I’m just wondering what it is that causes you to feel the need to hold that – that responsibility to hold them to it. It’s um, boundaries. And to everybody else is here is the fact that by the same issues I’m just curious is to why it seems to be you that keeps bringing it and keeps – that’s what it feels like. And so I’m just curious about that. 

00:48:25
Olga 

00:48:25
OLGA Yeah. I – I would appreciate if everybody would say that how – how you feel rather than just toss questions. Because I feel like when someone asks me, like why do take this. It’s not – sometimes it’s from curiosity. And sometimes it’s just feels like, you know, like you’re – I don’t know what I mean. So, can I ask you also to tell what to talk about your feelings and -- 

00:48:50
MARY Well, that’s why I’m here. 

00:48:50
OLGA And maybe I’m doing the same right now. But I don’t know. I’m confused. 

00:48:50
MARY I’m feeling irritated. And I’m sure -- 

00:48:55
OLGA Me too. Me too. 

00:48:55
MARY -- feeling irritated about you feeling as though you need to intervene on his behalf. 

00:49:00
OLGA Not on his behalf. 

00:49:00
MARY You think that’s because -- 

00:49:00
OLGA On the behalf of a group I would say. 

00:49:05
MARY Like issue you raise you can talk for yourself. But -- 

00:49:05
OLGA Yeah, yeah. That’s exactly what I’m -- 

00:49:10
MARY But you commented before you were talking about the group. And I’m saying that I, um – find you -- 

00:49:15
OLGA I – well, I find your, you know, uh, propositions and what you say very, you know, meaningful. It’s not like I try to say that – I see the point you are making. That – just that I am – I feel bad. I see benefits for myself to talk about myself. 

00:49:30
MARY Right. 

00:49:30
OLGA I guess ask questions and being a consultant role, you know. I can do that both. But we decided to be your—ourselves rather than -- 

00:49:40
MARY Well, you decided -- 

00:49:40
OLGA Okay. 

00:49:40
MARY -- what you were going to do. But in the mean time, I was entered – interacting with him and you jumped in for the second time. 

00:49:50
OLGA I – I didn’t have the right to do that? 

00:49:50
MARY I’m curious as to why you feel the need to do distract -- 

00:49:55
OLGA I just feel -- 

00:49:55
MARY -- the conversation from he and I to you. 

00:49:55
OLGA Did I distract your conversation? 

00:50:00
JOHN I – I experienced your comment on two levels. One was like a really interesting question for me. It’s like, okay am I – I’m being seen at least as taking this role. And I think I genuinely taking a certain role. I don’t know if it’s exactly the way you’re saying I’m taking. But I am taking a role. And it’s something I can learn from. It’s like, wow, I’m being seen as this. I’m behaving in this way. That’s a really interesting question. The second level, which was what Olga pointed out, I think, was a level of aggression. You were smiling and asking me a very polite question. 

00:50:30
MARY Yeah. That’s what I thought. 

00:50:30
JOHN I’m wondering why, with a big smile on your face. But you’re really kind of pissed at me. 

00:50:35
MARY Um-hmm. I’m definitely pissed at you. So I can – I – you know, I’m not just shy about saying that I’m pissed. 

00:50:40
Kelley 

00:50:40
KELLEY She – I think she did say, listen I’m irritated. And she did – although she did ask you a question. And I don’t feel – I – I hope I don’t look as though I’m trying to protect you or defend you. I was also very irritated by that, as well. 

00:50:55
Dr. Taylor 

00:50:55
DR. FLORA TAYLOR One question is, what would the battle be in the service of. So as I track it, actually, another member actually raised the issue of lateness. And yet, the fight occurred in this pair. And that there has been some reference to preexisting, something, tension, something. 

00:51:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:51:15
DR. FLORA TAYLOR So, gathering size anyway. So the question is, what – what’s all that in the service of. 

00:51:20
DR. MARY MCRAE Race and gender dynamics are most prominent in this vignette. It starts with Mary and Jack a continuation of Mary’s challenge to white men taking up authority roles in the group. Olga’s challenge to Mary could be perceived as a white woman stepping in to preserve the privileged status of white men in power. White women hold special relationships with white men. Such as mother, daughter, sister, wife and lover. Jack seems to take on a stereotypical white male role. Attempting to lead the group in setting time boundaries. He also takes on a consultant role with Mary and Olga. Making an observation and an interpretation. Culturally, white heterosexual men are socialized to minimize emotions. To be productive, reliable, and strong. In groups, these white men often seem to lack the vocabulary and skill set to express emotions. So they may be perceived as lacking self awareness and sensitivity. Members from other racial, cultural and gender groups may project their fears of taking up such roles onto white men. Who then enact the role of the person who is seemingly strong and smart enough to be in control. The other thing that you might have observed is that there were two empty chairs on each side of Jack. He may have been speaking to his sense of isolation and wondering why him and not other members. Perhaps the sense of isolation made him anxious. And this is his way of connecting. What different take might you have about the dynamic processes in this vignette. Why. Consider the consultant’s question. What purpose might the conflict serve for the group. Members often tend to take up familiar gender and racial roles. What different take might you have about the dynamic processes in this vignette. Why. 

00:53:35
[sil.] 

00:53:40
DR. MARY MCRAE Sometimes group members become polarized. Holding steadfastly to two different ideological perspectives. What do you see as the two perspectives in this next vignette. 

00:53:50
KELLEY I’m noticing that although, you know I was one of – of – of, uh, a few members of the group that were late today. I didn’t duke it out with you. It was Mary. And Mary duked it out yesterday with Pat. And – and I am – I’ve noticed that I’ve kind of, sided with Mary throughout this whole thing. And I’m wondering what is it with white men and Mary. And then my tendency to side with her too. That is like, so – the struggle that I’m trying to make sense of. 

00:54:35
Mary 

00:54:35
MARY I react to people, typically white men, who feel as though they’re in charge of everything. And so, when I hear you directing it pisses me off. And so I respond to being pissed off with people that are directing. Regardless of where they are. And so I didn’t hear you as directing. I heard you as being, um, compassionate, concerned, wanting to engage. And so I’m pleased to engage across racial lines when people are being respectful in the process. And I – I do think that there’s something in the genes of – of some white men. And I’m talking about these in particular, but historical. That says I’m in charge and I set the rules. And so that’s what I react to. 

00:55:30
Arthur 

00:55:30
ARTHUR  For me what put – that brings up for me is, um, like I want to ask you what would it take for me to be in a leadership position. What is it about me that doesn’t get to be the leader. That you don’t react that way to. 

00:55:50
MARY It is my wish that you could be in a leadership role and not feel like you have to tell everybody what to do. 

00:56:00
Maritza 

00:56:00
MARITZA Well, what is your definition of leadership then. In my mind that leadership is not necessarily the first person who talks. It’s not necessarily the person who gives out instructions. Is leadership right behind. Is leadership from the middle. And it takes all sort of forms. And even the person with real power, that has leadership himself. So, I think that for me one of the key characteristics of being able to – to lead us to be put our group together and that requires being able to have a curiosity to engage. 

00:56:30
Monique 

00:56:30
MONIQUE I think going back to what Mary said, as the second African American woman in the room, I understand what she’s feeling with her – saying that, um, she has a problem with white men who feel like they need to take charge. But I think there’s a generational difference. Because it’s not just for me, um, just, uh, white men. It’s men in – in general. You know, and I think my issue is that, I just see women and I don’t see a color or race or culture. I – and my issue is I don’t like for any man to feel like they have control. So how Mary feels is if it was just a white man. I believe that if Daniel said anything, I would take offense. And I think I did yesterday. 

00:57:25
Dr. Taylor 

00:57:25
DR. FLORA TAYLOR The group started at nine o’clock. And the question was, whether or not you were going to use the time in the way in which it’s been prescribed. And although one side of the argument, if you will, is that the white men have tended to give voice to questions that not only white men um, the question of time boundaries and how do we manage them. Another – the flip side to the question is, what would happen if no one took responsibility for managing our boundaries. Such that – I mean, there is a protective element in it that the group benefits from. To the extent that one values being here together. Still yet we have one person who is not yet come. So, how do you make sense of the value that is brought by someone trying to mind the boundaries. As well as the way in which one may feel pressed by somebody’s, uh, putting their agdenda, their wish forward. Because this one has an either or perspective. Something’s good or it’s bad. And it’s a problem. 

00:58:40
DR. MARY MCRAE In this vignette, Mary states that she is pissed off when white men act as if they are in charge. When Arthur asks if she could see him as a leader, he may be referring not only to his race, but to his age and experience. Maritza the young Asian woman, steps in to challenge Mary and her definition of leadership. Monique, a young black woman, says that she does not see color. Gender seems to be more important to her. She is breaking her racial alliance with Mary. And in some ways joining the younger members, Arthur and Maritza. The older generation, Mary and Jack in this vignette, seem to be the holders of the historical racial tension between black and white Americans. Sometimes racial dynamics are so strong that it is hard to see the positive sides in interpersonal and group relations. The consultant points out the protective element displayed by the white men of taking responsibility for the time boundaries. As well as the feeling of oppression the behavior might stimulate in members from disenfranchised groups. The paradoxical feeling of being protected while at the same time feeling oppressed can create a sense of anxiety. 

01:00:10
[sil.] 

01:00:15
DR. MARY MCRAE All groups struggle with issues of power, authority and leadership. When the members are from different racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, this is an added layer. Hidden assumptions and stereotypes are more often enacted then spoken about. What power struggles do you observe in this next vignette. What are the alliances. What do you think the group members might be anxious about. 

01:00:40
Mary 

01:00:40
MARY For me it would feel important to, um, start to work with whoever is here, rather than prescribing what – wagging your finger at who’s not here. I – uh, I had a point that I don’t want to lose. You made, uh, reference that there is a – um, a age difference that you know, that’s in operation and that I was struggling with the women men that are here. And you mentioned the fact that, um, that you just see men. One of the things that’s painfully striking to me is that there are no men of color of my generation here. And that we have a young man of color who has a lot of potential. And I’m excited for you that you can just struggle with men in general. To me that feels like a generational thing that you can struggle with men in general. But for me, I am in the room, in life, generally, there are no men of color that are of my generation. None. And in my work life as well as in other places, there are none. So my being pissed off about white men taking over stuff it’s also being pissed off about the fact that something goes on that – that prevents men of color of my generation from being here or in my work life or in my class or other places. 

01:02:30
Olga 

01:02:30
OLGA Well that’s so important that before made a point about the – you know, that, you know, there is one person missing and, um, you know, I feel that yesterday what kind of shut—I mean maybe I did also participate in that. I didn’t – uh, kind of supporting his idea of exchange and personal information. And I kind of feel guilted about it. 

01:02:55
Jack 

01:02:55
JOHN I feel his absence a great deal too. And I – it Mary you – if you’re taking it back to me I said I’m coming off as bully. As – as commandeering, as – as pressing the agenda. I feel like his absence is – is, um, is data towards that. 

01:03:10
John 

01:03:10
JOHN I find myself trying to go back and replay my interactions with him. I have a feeling of guilt that I wish him out of the group. 

01:03:20
Kelley 

01:03:20
KELLEY I don’t mean to digress, but um, what – your last comment about not, um, really having an opportunity to engage with black men of your cohort. Um, as you were talking about I felt very, um, emotional. And I saw something that it seemed very emotional for you as well. And something in the back of my head, that’s – that’s always something that has stirred up for me in the back of my head, that I don’t have men towards – I have meet the mentorship of, uh, women of color. But I struggle with the – the fact that I don’t have the same mentorship from men of color as easily. And as frequently. I don’t know why that may have resonated with me on that level. But I – I just wanted you – kind of acknowledge your last comment. Because it seemed to – to touch something for you and I felt that as well. 

01:04:30
MARY Thank you. I appreciate that. Um, it is meaningful. 

01:04:30
MONIQUE Thank god. So excited. 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN Me too. 

01:04:40
UNKNOWN You just saved the group. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Perfect timing. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Sort to speak. 

01:04:50
Arthur 

01:04:50
ARTHUR To add to that, um, you know, you’re – you’re – I don’t mean to make your position, um, any less than what it is. Uh, but what I relate to that in a very different way. I mean, I don’t have – I also have not had very many, um, relationships with, uh, men of color. Um, I – I haven’t – my parents don’t have very many friends who are black. I, um, I don’t have very many uh, teachers in my life that have been African American. Um, and so it’s – I – I will – it’s strange to say that, like, we relate to that experience. Because we relate to it in a – in a very different way. Um, but it – I mean, I just wanted to kind of bring up that as relation that it impacts everyone. 

01:05:45
Dr. Taylor 

01:05:45
DR. FLORA TAYLOR Yeah. You know, I feel like this is touching but it’s flight. Um-hmm. It’s really not about the here and now at all. And I experience it actually as a sabotaging of the work that this group can do. And in an assault on the authority of the conference. Which is a black woman. And who she has brought here to be in the work with you. 

01:06:05
DR. MARY MCRAE  In this vignette, Mary attempts to take up a leadership role. First she states what she thinks the rules should be for managing the time boundaries. Then she shares her pain of not having black male peers in the group. As well as in other settings. Mary’s statement might have made the group anxious, particularly since it touches on several unconscious levels of what the group has been struggling with in terms of racial, gender and generational dynamics related to power, authority, boundaries and leadership. Olga is a white European immigrant. Which gives her racial privilege. She has noted that she tends to hold the anxiety for the group. Perhaps this is why she changes the topic to the missing member. Two other white men in the group join her. Is this Olga’s anxiety about the topic or the group possibly ousting a member. Or is this a way of challenging Mary’s attempt to take up leadership. Why does she not recognize Mary’s concern before moving on. Sometimes immigrants learn and internalize negative stereotypes held by the dominant group. Which leads them to collude with and join the white majority group that tends to have more power and resources. Could it be that Olga has a stronger alliance with the white men in the group. Kelley and Arthur join Mary in talking about what is missing. Black men in authority rather than what they have, which is black women in authority. The consultant calls this an attack on the leadership of black women in the conference. The group relations conference was a temporary institution with two black women as directors. And the group that was being videotaped was given a black woman consultant. The power struggle in the group may represent its feelings about black women in authority in the group. And in the conference overall.

01:08:20
DR. MARY MCRAE This next vignette consider the issues of cultural identity and how different levels of acculturation influence how and which members might take up the role of leadership and authority in the group. 

01:08:35
Daniel 

01:08:35
MING-HUI I want to, uh, first apologize for being late. And in addition to, uh, apologizing I think it’s probably important to talk about me being late. And also, um, the issue of – going back to the consultant said, um, the task. And, uh, authority of the conference. And, um, I have been – I have having ambivalence about, um, authority of this conference. Um, and I think that has to do with me being late. Uh, I mean, I didn’t hear alarm went off. And I think I – but that was not really an excuse. I went – before I came here I was really worried, like – because yesterday I was the – one of the people who say something about, you know, two of you being late. So I was worried like, well, when I came here today, I probably would be grilled. Um, but I kind of prepared for it. And I think, um, I think I kind of feel comfortable about sharing some of my ambivalent. 

01:09:50
MARITZA I had the direct reaction to you telling me about aggression. I was just so much fighting about I – at first I thought, I didn’t know what to make sense, actually, of what you trying to say. And I felt very confused. And I feel I don’t know what your point is. 

01:10:10
MING-HUI Okay. 

01:10:10
Maritza 

01:10:10
MARITZA And okay, you’re trying to tell us well, you feel bad about coming here late. And what may be the reasons. And then sharing actually with us. You may have some residual, you know, feeling of hurt or rejection. And sharing it. 

01:10:20
MING-HUI Right. 

01:10:20
MARITZA So, on the one hand I felt, wow, how refreshing does – in my life growing up, like, Asian male authority figures are – I flee from them, as far away as possible. And I react very strongly. I think in general first relating to your feelings about male authority. I mean, a man tells me what to do my first inclination is to not listen to it. But I try very hard to think about what is being said. And on top of that an Asian male, that is just like, doesn’t work for me. So the way I think of demeanor it’s just so mild it’s very refreshing in a comforting for me. But then I tie it to I am repressing a lot of aggression, I think, perhaps towards just Asian male figures. And it could be possibly towards you, that I wasn’t aware of. And I think that part of it is also because you’re so – you – you signify to me that Asian values. Like being very humble. 

01:11:25
MING-HUI I think probably has to do with culture and also my family. Um, and I think it’s common for Asians to have – I don’t know how to characterize it. But, you know, some kind of -- it different way of relating to authority then, like, say, general Americans. Um, Asian – Asian I think the stereotypical, like, Asians like to make peace with each other. And they don’t like to stand out. But Americans are more encouraged to, like, um, speak up for yourself. 

01:12:00
MARITZA I think I – I talk about is was yesterday that if there is an Asian leader I think I’m very scared I’ll be disappointed. Because in my mind an Asian leader is not – doesn’t have to determiner. He doesn’t have that packaging to – to defend, to stand out to – to not control, but just be – be able to deal with any situation that comes along. And that’s – that’s my – maybe stereotypy in my mind. Or maybe that is a real truth. And that – that real truth is very scary for me. 

01:12:35
Mary 

01:12:35
MARY When you say scary are you – um, are you – I just want to – some clarity. Are you saying that you’re frightened that the leader won’t do those things. And therefore you’ll be disappointed. 

01:12:45
Maritza 

01:12:45
MARITZA Um, right. I’m – I’m afraid that the leader may not perceived as a leader. In the general American sense. And so an Asian leader may display very quiet qualities. Maybe deal with things in a very different way. Maybe take a longer time like even to explain your point across. And maybe being perceived as, well please cut to the chase. You know, I don’t understand, you know. Like – so in me this is an American part, there’s an American voice it’s kind of maybe criticizing even myself. There’s another part saying, well, it’s – it’s a matter of, like, maybe he’s not being understood. So how – how you make it to be understood. And, I see playing out in this group too, um, I – I guess the two of us tend to always just react rather than bringing up something. 

01:13:35
Jack 

01:13:35
JOHN And I disagree. I – I think the group has kind of been – the Asians have been doing some incredible work for the group. And I’ve been trying to figure out what it’s been for the last five or 10 minutes. So I thought – and you – you were – you talk about being mild mannered. But there was nothing mild mannered about being 15 minutes late. It’s kind of for you a pretty big statement. Um, so I don’t know. I just – I think you guys have – been doing some work. And I wonder what the rest of – how we – what work you’re doing for us in terms of our own ambivalence, either leadership, conflicts, allegiances, um, do I have an allegiance with you and a conflict with you and a conflict with you by proxy. And the allegiance with you, maybe, kind of. But a conflict with – you know. I don’t know we all -- I don’t know. 

01:14:20
Dr. Taylor 

01:14:20
DR. FLORA TAYLOR There were multiple fights going on and one of them was a cross race. And then you have two Asians. And I’m aware of using that word as if it’s full of meaning. When Asians are not monolithic. So there’s something about when you can’t even put your name in here. You can’t even go around and identify yourselves in the ways in which you would like to. That people get lumped. So the individual gets lost a little bit. It’s harder to bring your full self when people don’t even know your name. So, in the discourse between white and black, where the Asians fit. And two Asians come and bring their, kind of leadership. Which feels, I think, southing to this group after so much fighting. And being stuck, right. And leading from a place of, here’s my experience and here’s how I understand the way in which it has affected our life together as a group. Which in fact is the currency of this particular institution. That’s the currency. That’s the currency. 

01:15:30
DR. MARY MCRAE  In this vignette, Daniel, a first generation immigrant and Maritza, a second generation immigrant explore their differences in culture and gender. Maritza is working out her internalized projections of Asian stereotypes about leadership and authority. She seems to be in the process of forming a more positive cultural and racial identity. Daniel, seems to proudly hold onto his Asian cultural values. He also lets the group know that he has some ambivalence about accepting the black women in authority in the conference. The dynamics between minority groups, such as Asian and African American members serve as a reminder to us to pay attention to their interactions as well. Conversations about discrimination, racism and cultural differences in the US tend to focus on race issues surrounding black and white. In groups, there may seem like there is little room to discuss issues concerning class, immigration, ethnicity and sexuality. As well as the discrimination prejudice and power struggles that center around these issues. 

01:16:50
[sil.] 

01:16:55
DR. MARY MCRAE Termination is a very important part of group life. Members often consider what has not been said or shared. Is there space and time to do so. See if you can identify when the group members attempt to take flight from the anxiety that is brought to the surface in this last session. 

01:17:15
Mary 

01:17:15
MARY I’m really conscious of the fact that this is our last group. Okay. And that kind of – there’s only about 50 minutes left. And I’m thinking about all of – what the conference has meant. This group in particular has meant. And I have difficulty with, um, termination. And so my body has been, um, wanting to make sure that at the end I’m not at the doorway thinking I could have, should have, ought to have said, done. And so I’m real conscious of that at this moment. 

01:18:05
MING-HUI I relate to that very much. I – I also – I feel this is kind of a home group for me. Around in a whole, like, conference experience. And despite this we only few times between all of us, uh, small group. I mean – I mean, I – I guess I didn’t come before mention. And – but I have somehow I just feel a sense of belonging. And – and I can relate to what you said that, um, you know, some kind of conference or – uh, yeah I – I have some feelings about termination also. Um, and I enjoy, uh, watching the people interact in here. And also and myself interacting with, uh, people. I appreciate, uh, interacting with you. Um, and hear from you about your thoughts about me and Asians. Not just, um – so I appreciate this interactions. 

01:19:20
Dr. Taylor 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN I have a sense that we’ve become a sanctuary. Do you agree with that we’re a sanctuary. 

01:19:30
DR. FLORA TAYLOR The data suggest to me that this is – at the unconscious level this has become the safest place to be, as a sanctuary is safe. 

01:19:40
John 

01:19:40
JOHN I have felt – I have been feeling exactly the same thing that this place was an anchor. And it struck me as weird that a place that I think of as the place that would be the most emotional and the place where emotional communication on a kind of narrow emotional plane has become in the context of everything that’s going on the safest place. Uh, I think it does feel like a sanctuary. 

01:20:15
DR. FLORA TAYLOR So, the problem is, but if it’s a sanctuary, what kind of work it’s done. What gets sacrificed. 

01:20:25
Patrick 

01:20:25
PATRICK And so it’s – I think it’s to me it’s like, uh – the sanctuary I think is a good work or a comfort place. But not a place of escape. Um, and I feel there’s – that too. I – I feel like a wisdom in the group too. And, um, you know, Mary’s bringing up, you know, the finality. Which, um, of the group, or termination. Which to me is also anxiety provoking. And, you know, have I done everything I could in the moment to do what I needed to do. And – so we’re as I feel comfort, like, questions like that then challenge me on another level. So it’s comforting in the sanctuary but it doesn’t feel escape. 

01:21:00
UNKNOWN It seems to me like, I’m feeling a little in the same step. But it seems like, if we’re – if this has become a sanctuary, and a safe place, then we’re carrying something that in – right now, that we need a safe place from. 

01:21:25
Jack 

01:21:25
JOHN I feel – I’m – sharing kind of lack of energy but an – but – at first in like a relief that, thank god, thank god. And I’m sitting here thinking, like, yeah, I’m – I’m resonating with a relaxed thing. And then my hand’s trembling. And I’m realizing, like, I’m fucking desperate for a safe home, place. You know, and I’m not safe in Colorado because I can tell because my hands trembling. Uh -- 

01:21:55
Mary 

01:21:55
MARY Are you interested in talking about that. 

01:22:00
JOHN No. But I just did, didn’t I. 

01:22:00
Arthur 

01:22:00
ARTHUR I guess maybe what I’m reacting to is, uh, taking up those parts of myself that I’m – that I’m – I want to make visible. Uh, but are difficult. And I think, um, knowing you, Jack, and what’ve – the work you’ve been doing, uh, I resonate with that. And I sense that you’re trying to put out tests, you know, some of these parts that you could keep hidden. And, um, finding out if that’s okay. I’ll be -- 

01:22:30
JOHN You saved my ass in repressed form. Thank you. 

01:22:35
DR. FLORA TAYLOR Well, I don’t know. I think it might be more content. Um, people – uh, the references are to outside but all of those things that were happening out there, are happening in here at the same time. And we could actually look at them here. 

01:22:50
DR. MARY MCRAE The power dynamic of leadership is still in play in this group. Mary starts with reflections on the group experience. The group has experienced many conflicting moments. Yet it now feels like a sanctuary. Why. When Jack says he is desperately seeking a safe place and has asked why, Arthur steps in and saves him. This is something that often occurs when there is tension and anxiety in the group. The conversation moves to something else. The consultant points out that perhaps what is spoken about as outside is actually inside the group. You might also want to consider any paring that is taking place during this conversation. The final conflict on race and gender is worked on in this vignette. In terms of dealing with a content of the issue the group manages quite calmly. What do you think is the underlying conflict that surfaces which the group choices not to deal with during its termination. 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN Well, I – what I noticed was this exchange between -- 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN He’s right. 

01:24:05
John 

01:24:05
JOHN -- between you and you and him for helping you as Mary is question. And then you started – you took us in a totally different direction which was about our consultant. Which was all okay. But it’s what I observed and my initial reaction to that was, there’s – there’s something going on here that is being hid – that is – that I’m being teased by. 

01:24:35
JACK And if you know the story you’d know that this wasn’t a misdirection. Because I indeed – I didn’t say we had the most attractive consultant. I said, I’ve been at conferences where when I’ve said, like, who’s Dr. Taylor. People say, she’s the beautiful one. It’s how she is – it’s how I’ve come to know – that I met you. So, that was -- 

01:24:50
UNKNOWN But at the story – at the time -- 

01:24:50
JACK No. That was what I said on the first day. Which is connected in our sexuality group that the four of us are in with my admission that I don’t have sexual attractions to black women. That came out in conference that I feel like was a – I’m scared shitless but I realized that like five 30 this morning. It’s been – and, you know, begin to have any black women in our group. So we excluded women for our – black women from our group. Their excluded from my, sort of, sexual fantasy life. Oh, yeah, I made this comment about how beautiful or, I was given a woman consultant was in here. And I feel like – I mean afterwards in our small – in our sexuality group I got – it was the or the lightning bolts and thunder. And I feel like the rest of the conference has been me liking those and talking about that. 

01:25:40
Monique 

01:25:40
MONIQUE So I feel like you are attracted to black women. But you’re – because of the fact that you identify her as beautiful, um, it – even with – when other people say it, you still identify her as that. So I think that’s what’s really scaring you right now is that I don’t in my mind think that I should believe that black women are pretty. Or – or attracted to black women. But, the fantasy is and the deeper thought is I really do. And that’s – I think that’s what’s scaring you right now. Is that you really do. You’re coming to that realization. 

01:26:15
Jack 

01:26:15
JACK I’m – I’m totally willing to – I mean, to – I – I experience both our consultant and several of the consultants and several of the members who are African American women as beautiful and dignified and brilliant and wise and have rocked my world. But when I think about who I want to get in bed with, who I want to undress, I think about white women. 

01:26:40
MONIQUE Okay. Okay. Attraction when I’m -- 

01:26:40
JACK Sexy. 

01:26:40
MONIQUE Okay. I’m think attraction. 

01:26:45
JACK I said sexy. 

01:26:45
MONIQUE Okay. 

01:26:45
JACK Attraction definitely. Rock my world. 

01:26:45
MONIQUE Okay. 

01:26:45
JACK And I find that beautiful and moving and powerful. 

01:26:50
MONIQUE Okay. 

01:26:50
JACK But – but I have this – this – at this deeper limit level. It’s a bias that I hold. And it’s a bias that I felt like was reflected of – of the membership of the – of our weekly – the sexuality group. 

01:27:05
MARY I’m not sure I’m understanding what it is that you’re so shameful about. 

01:27:10
JACK It feels – I mean, it’s the most – it’s – it’s a complete unrepentant racial bias. Um, and I feel like in our – we’ve been in the life, we have biases that are kind of unconscious. And I don’t feel like I’m a raving racist because of it. It was – it’s not something that feels icky. Feels ugly, like an ugly thing to say. 

01:27:35
MONIQUE I don’t think you should say that. Because I think everybody – I think it’s just your – what – what your preference is. My sexual preference when I think about who I want to have sex with or – I don’t really want to have sex with a skinny man. That’s just me. I don’t – I’m a little bit bigger than – than – you know. I don’t want to have sex with a skinny man. 

01:28:00
UNKNOWN We’re not – we’re not going anywhere. 

01:28:00
Monique 

01:28:00
MONIQUE See. Well, I – well to take it away from skinny there’s other preferences that I have. But I – I don’t think you should feel ashamed of that. Because you’re not just, uh, a race issue or, you know, my own bias. It’s just my preference and what I like. So I don’t think you should feel ashamed of that at all. Because I wasn’t offended. I don’t know about Mary but I wasn’t offended. 

01:28:25
Mary 

01:28:25
MARY Well, Monique I am truly pleased to be here with you. Um, my thought is that what I want is respect and, um, appreciation for me as a person. I mean, I have no interest in being a part of your sexual fantasies. So you feel that, um, the idea of being a racist is about what you’re private sexual fantasies are about. That’s not it for me. And so my, um – hearing your personal struggle helped me to recognize that sometimes when I have immediate interactions with somebody that is disrespectful, that it, um, takes energy, my emotional energy, that I need to be able to figure out how to get my emotional energy back. And not to hold on to what it is that – that I would refer to as a settling dignity. That’s – that happens with me often in terms of the race stuff and white men. And when I heard you talking about your pain and struggle, that melted for me. And so, if indeed the only issue is that you have that’s biased is your – is your sexual fantasy then surely you don’t have a problem with me. 

01:30:00
JACK I’m willing – in the here and now, I mean, your two comments you both been really powerful in particular. You have a very powerful in my mind in my thoughts about this conference. And – and my respect for you and my respect for you giving me a hard time at times, has been great. And my respect now for you talking about change and helping me through my change it feels – it feels really great. I appreciate it. 

01:30:30
DR. FLORA TAYLOR So it seems like one of the, um, items on the agenda for this last session is with, uh, truth and reconciliation. 

01:30:40
DR. MARY MCRAE When Jack admits to his racial bias in terms of sexual preference Monique’s first response is to try and make it okay. She continues her maternal role in the group. Especially that of caring for white men. The two black women attempt to make amends. Although we might think that Jack is really saying something that many black women might find offensive. Monique’s comments about her own sexual preferences is a subtle attack on Jack. Who is tall and thin. The group as the consultant points out is working with truth and reconciliation. There is little room for more racial and cultural conflict during the termination session. 

01:31:30
[sil.] 

01:31:35
DR. MARY MCRAE In this last vignette, there is some pairing among members and enactment of racial and cultural dynamics around leadership and authority. See if you can recognize the racial, ethnic and authority dynamics as they occur. 

01:31:50
MING-HUI And I – I actually want to say something to, um, before. I says, uh, I – I say some – I made a comment about you in the large group. And that’s an issue that I, you know, kind of struggle with in terms of working with or, um, dealing with people who are very passionate about things. And – and can be like emotional. And then I often find myself um, fearful of people like that. And – and it kind of stopped me from getting to the my person, you know, different levels. And then – so I have been thinking about it maybe unconsciously, uh, through this conference. Like, in terms of how I can maybe in the future, like, how I can work with people like you, um, who may be passionate about something that might be scary, at times. But still I can collaborate with them. And that to be so intimidated by that. 

01:33:00
Monique 

01:33:00
MONIQUE It’s funny that you say that. Because I also – it’s not a fear, but it’s an anxiety for me to work with people who are so passionate. Because if it feels like, you know, when you have that person who is just like, you know we got to do this, we got to do that, we got to do this. And then now to hear you say that I am that person is like, you know, I don’t know exactly how I should feel about that. Because I’m always the one like, I don’t want to work with this guy. He’s just going to be so – he’s too passionate about what he’s doing. He doesn’t know how to have a break, you know. And I don’t like working with that person. I find myself always trying to keep away or even coming in conflict with that person. So to hear you say that I’m that person it – it’s kind of weird for me to hear that. Because I always thought that I was a more laid back, you know, you can see the passion but not really. I never really wanted to show that. And I guess that’s what’s coming out. Because I am passionate about a lot of stuff that I do. And I – when you were saying that I was noticing how passionate I am about this group. 

01:34:05
Maritza 

01:34:05
MARITZA I’m responding to the powerful side of you. Maybe it’s a different take on the passion is the – you – you said that you don’t experience yourself like that all the time. Because you be should – should do I that. But I – I feel that you are able to say what you like and what you don’t like, what you don’t want, pretty instantaneously. So the power I feel from you, um, is very much coming from there. That you’re able to articulate it. And I – I also have this reaction to you, Mary, I think I told you before that if the room temperature is not right, if you need this, if you need that, you’re able to articulate it right away. Whereas I will ruminate it for a little while thinking maybe I can put up with it. Maybe I can cope with it. Yeah, I can live within the system for a little bit. And then it’ll be awhile later that I realize well I don’t like this system. 

01:35:00
Dr. Taylor 

01:35:00
DR. FLORA TAYLOR Let me lay some things out that I think are, um, at work. I think there are – part of the confusion is that there are a lot of things happening at the same time. So, one of them is that there are a couple of, um, quiet voices. Right, so, there’s something that’s being held that’s not being spoken to. That’s one of the thing. Another one is, um, the membership has been focused actually on these two black women. And the ways in which they’ve appreciated their presence and their work here. But it is no coincidence of course, that you also have an African American female consultant. And that you have running the conference both an African American founding director as well as an African American managing director and the director in training is an African American. So there’s something about how black women get authorized here and the group enacted. So that’s the second thing. A third thing is in the week, one of the powerful things that has been transported into this room from that experience is the way in which sexual fantasies, comments, thoughts – fleeting thoughts, etcetera had to be disembodied in order to be said. Because if you had to say in that context I actually feel this thing. It might never have happened. So by putting it out and – and not having to own it, it made it safer to do it. And then a member came and was able to own it here. Which meant that we actually had to look at what sexual parts do we care to own here, or not. And then you have these cross, uh, generational conversations, right. So already it’s been clear that there – the attractions within race, what happens when its taboo because it’s also across generation. So all – these things and others I’m sure, are at work at the same time. And it’s – it’s, uh, maybe a little frightening. 

01:37:00
DR. MARY MCRAE Culturally, the two Asian members, Daniel and Maritza express their admiration for the two black women’s courage and passion in expressing themselves. Noting that Asian culture is more subtle. The consultant’s last intervention is layered in, pointing out a number of things to the group. First, she acknowledges the quiet voices in the group. She wonders if the focus on the two black women members has anything to do with her own role. As well that of the black women in leadership at the conference. Are members in this last session enacting their desire to connect with the consultant and the conference leadership. Members who are similar to those in authority, in race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age or social class often act as stand ins. They allow other members to engage with them in ways they might fantasize about with those in leadership. The consultant also speaks to how the sexual fantasies of the members might have been disembodied. Making attractions across differences more palpable.

DR. MARY MCRAE In summary, racial, ethnic and cultural dynamics in groups are an integral part of our daily interactions. We each have multiple identities. With one being more salient than the other in certain situations. In this vide we have highlighted many of the dynamics that will be helpful to you in working with racially and culturally diverse groups and teams. The most important thing is to become more aware of the differences and commonalities that exist in groups. To find ways to acknowledge them. And then develop skill sets for working with and managing them. Remember, racial and cultural dynamics are stimulated by individual personality, power and authority differences, role taking and role giving, boundaries. Such as task, time and territory and psychological boundaries learned from cultural attitudes, faith, hidden assumptions, myths and ideology Acknowledging and discussing racial and cultural dynamics with these points in mind can be very rewarding.

Special Thanks 

01:41:05
My research team, who helped me to identify the vignettes, 

01:41:05
analyze them, and develop the script for this video. Anthony Friere 

01:41:05
took up the role of producer in the first phase of developing the video. 

01:41:05
I would like to give a special thanks to those who participated 

01:41:05
as members in the group and to Dr. Flora Taylor, 

01:41:05
for allowing us to videotape them 

01:41:05
as they worked.
