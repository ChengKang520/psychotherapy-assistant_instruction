ROBERT SCHWARZ This is energy psychology, a brief treatment for trauma. I'm Dr. Robert Schwarz, uh… I've been, uh… I'm the… currently the Executive Director of the Association for Comprehensive Energy Psychology. But I've been in Erickson guy, brief therapy guy since back in the '80s. I was at the Erickson Congress years ago. I did a lot of work with brief therapy. Many years ago, I organized the therapeutic conversations, the TC conferences. So I… I love brief therapy. Umm… And I'm really happy that we're starting to get some energy psychology into a brief therapy conference because it's brief and it's a therapy. Umm… Let's see, I'm supposed to read these things. So all right. Our educational objectives are to elucidate the three steps of memory reconsolidation, and how energy psychology achieve them? Describe four steps of Emotional (inaudible) Techniques for treating trauma and list at least two pieces of research that demonstrates the effectiveness of PTSD. So actually, I've got a lot of stuff planned them in this 90 minutes. I'm hoping to get through it pretty quickly and with the possibility of doing a demonstration on… some of the (inaudible). Let me just find a couple of things out. How many people already do or, you know, do some form of energy psychology, tapping EFT, TFT, some of you. How many people are have heard about it, and you know what got here? It was like, okay, I've heard about it, I want to know what's the deal with this stuff? Oh, oh good. How many people are like, yeah, right. This… Good, good, that's good, I like that. All right, so we have… we have… we have a bit of a… bit of a spectrum, so I… I think I've planned this for just about… about that. Okay. Now. So Energy Psychology, what the heck is it? Umm… I'm gonna suggest to you, this is a… a definition I use, umm… if you go… this is not the definition you'll see on the ASAP(ph) website. Oh, by the way, if you stick around to the end, I'll… I'll give you some cool promo codes to get some really cool stuff. Anyway, Energy Psychology is a family of focused and brief psychotherapies. So it's focused in brief that use exposure, right? So we're gonna have people… In this case, we have people think about things that bug them, and acupoint stimulation, usually it's acupoint, you can use other things as well, by the way, you can use chakras. But today, in the… in the biofield, for today, we're only gonna be talking about acupoints stimulation or acupoint tapping. To release "Stuck energy/information in the mind-body system that is usually the result of unresolved "t" or "T" trauma," and as a rule, they're non-hav reactive… This is a non-hav reactive approach. So let's make sure. So small… "T" trauma, you know, that's raped, by Cossacks(ph) and everybody raises DSM, you know, the big stuff that we all know is terrible. Little "t" trauma are really all the kinds of traumatic events or events that are bigger than a person can handle at a given moment. So they're don't have the resources online to handle it and it becomes traumatic for them, so it could be, somebody laughed at you, hardly the same as being raped, but for some folks, at certain times that can be a very traumatic event and it becomes the thing that gets stuck in the system and causes anxiety and trouble. Later on we'll talk about that. Now if you're an energy psychology approaches, there are rules you have to have letters, you know, everything has to have like, three letters for the most part, uh… EFT, or TFT, TAT, AIT, these are all three letters. There are few exceptions. Umm… the ones that most people know about are… is that gonna reach. Nope. Emotional Freedom Techniques, not technique. EFT, not to be confused with Emotionally Focused Therapy, Alice Sue Johnson or Thought Feel Therapy, those are the two… these are the two that umm… have the most research and most people do. There are… there are others, I'll mention, for instance, TAT is acupressure technique or TAT, and another one is Advanced Integrative Therapy or AIT that uses the shocker system. And there are others, but again we have a 90-minute talk, so there's only so much we can do. So I said they were brief. Okay, exactly, how brief? I'll be talking about. Now before we answer that, let's get a little context. Umm… You know, it turns out that roughly 3.5% of the adult population are… are… are likely to develop PTSD at some time in their life, that's a lot of people, that's at five least million people. And perhaps more importantly, uh… you know, in… in Iraq and Afghanistan, up to 24% of… of infantry with direct military combat are likely to get PTSD, that's basically one in four. And this is really an interesting finding, uh… there was uh… a meta-analysis done back in 2013. They looked at a 112 of psychotherapy and drugs for PTSD and what they found basically, uh… was that CBT was considered the treatment of choice, uh… much better than drugs by the way. Uh… But, it took at least 10 plus sessions, and only a 40-60% success rate. So that's the state of the art, at least as of 2013, so that's the context of what we're talking about, 40-60% improvement rates, at least 10 sessions, uh… prolonged exposure, you know, there are… there are protocol, which I'll talk about later, it's 12… 90-minute sessions and again, only about a 49% success rate. So that's that… let's talk about Energy Psychology. Just how good is it? So I'm gonna tell you a story about what happened but there's research and I'm gonna tell you a story about what happened in Rwanda. Umm… About 12 years after the Rwandan genocide, which killed a million people. Uh… In 2006, a team of psychologists went through Rwanda to work in the (inaudible) orphanage. They worked with 50 kids, uh… who, you know, had PTSD. It was measurable. You know, they did… they did evaluations and clearly, they clinically, they had PTSD. Now let me ask you a question. You've got kids, who've just, you know, 12 years later, they've… they are the… they are the survivors of genocide. Exactly how many sessions would you be thinking you ought to use? 5, 10, 20. Well, these crazy folks, they decided for some reason. They were gonna use one, one session. Now what could you do with one session? So what they did, they would… what they would do is just… so you know, I will talk about, you know, what they would have the kids, think about the traumatic event, they would… they would… First of all, they were… they were talking in, you know, foreign language but they would bring up the traumatic events and then they would have them tap, like I'm doing on acupuncture points, these are all acupuncture points while they were recounting their events. This is the… this is Thought Feel Therapy. This is the basic… I just did the basic trauma protocol. There are four points. There are some other points that we can talk about. That's what they did. They would go after, they would… they would talk about event after event and they would tap along. Well, what happened? Umm… Well, after one session, what they… Let me just fix this because this is messing me up. Here we go. Uh… After one session, what they found was that the caregivers, when they rated their kids, the… the PTSD went from 100% to 6%, and the kids interestingly enough, they did all… they… they rated themselves. Only 72% them thought they had PTSD by… by, you know, checking certain things about themselves and that went down to 18%, this by the way is a picture of (inaudible), that's not, that's a different African thing, just FYI. And umm… these results were highly significant and they held at one-year… at one-year follow-up. But I wanna go… tell you a little more. I want to go more deeply into one specific story, so uh… this is a story as I'm gonna just read to what Carolyn (inaudible) who was the lead psychologists there, uh… she worked with one kid who was about 15 or 16, when she was three years old, three or four years old, uh… she witnessed her father being murdered by machete, uh… as part of the genocide. So here's what Carolyn (inaudible) says, "In a treatment session, I asked her to bring the flashbacks to mine and to imitate me as I tapped on a selected set of acupuncture points," while she told the story of the flashbacks. "Now after a few minutes her heart wrenching sobbing and depressed affix, suddenly transformed into smiles." Now normally as I said this is non-hav reactive approach, this is sort of an exception. "And when I asked her what happened, she reported having accessed fond memories for the first time. She could remember her father and family playing together. She said that until then, she had no memories from before the genocide. We might have stopped there, but I instead directed or back to what happened in the church. The girl started crying again, she told of seeing other people being killed. She reflected that she was alive because of her father's quick thinking and distracting the men's attention while telling the children to run. The girl cried again when she re-experienced the horror she witnessed while hiding outside with another young child, the two of them were the only survivors of their entire village. After about 15 or 20 minutes addressing one scene after another just tapping away, the girl smiled and began to talk about her family and very early childhood events. She was laughing wholeheartedly as she relate this and the… and the translator and I were…" uh… we then went… "…were laughing with her. Umm… And then, uh… when (inaudible) says, okay, so now when you think about what happened in the Church, what comes up. And the girl says, "Umm… I can still remember it but now it seems like a distant memory, like 12 years ago, so I don't know about you but when I hear stories like this, I say to myself, I want to be me some of that. I want to know how to do that, uh… which is don't know how got me into this many… many years ago back in the '90s, and I can tell you that this kind… I mean, well, this is a particularly dramatic kind of experience this kind of thing happens on pretty much regular basis, number one, so it's pretty regular, and number two, I'm always in awe every single time. I… I… I'm always a little bit stunned, umm… about just how quickly this very strange procedure which will be… will be discussing, where we're not trying to CBT and tell them how, what to think and how to feel, somehow it transforms this… this experience in a way that, uh… just… just sort of happens and people are freed up. So as I said, there are a number of, there are many different approaches, let's… Let me give you an… an overall protocol. Now how many people don't have any clue about? Raise your hand if you don't really know. You haven't seen EFT or tip tapping just so I know. Okay, fair enough, all right. How many people know or have (inaudible) looks like, raise your hand. EMDR, something, okay, all right. So here's the general… There are… there are a number of different approaches but let me give you the general protocol that most of the energy psychology approaches use with a few exceptions. First and foremost, you create rapport, you train a client, in the procedure you establish appropriate expectations, you do good therapy. And then generally what you do is the client identifies his specific target, you know, this is the thing I want to work on, this specific event and they give it a suds which means a Subjective Units of Distress you know what on a scale of 0 to 10, how much does this bother you. Zero doesn't bother you at all, ten is as much as it can be. And then… And then, if a client focuses non-judgmental awareness on the target, they think about that's the exposure, we… I want you to think about it, but without judgment, we'll talk about that in a minute, and they activate energy points. Again, it could be as we've talked about, we're tapping points, and sometimes with or without cognitive reframes. So depending who you see in the therapists, sometimes therapists will actively suggest changing frames, many times there's no attempt whatsoever to… to… to change the cognitive frame, although it will tends to change. So you do this procedure of tapping for a little bit and then you assess the clients new suds level, you find out if there's any new data, new feelings, new sensations, new images. And if the SUDs is not zero or if there's new data, you return to step A and you repeat, and you repeat the procedure. Does that sound familiar? Yes, sir. Oh, you, SUD… SUDS means Subjective Units of Distress. That's where you say on a scale of zero to ten, how much does this bother you. It bothers me of five, it bothers me of seven. And so that, in a nutshell, you know, the most, so the most simplest version as I'd like you to think about something, you know, think about the time that you were standing in front of a group of audience and you're flight was down and everybody laughs that you were embarrassed. Oh, it bothers me of six, okay, so you're gonna, maybe… you know, we're gonna do some tapping about it, and we do some tapping. How much does that bother you now? And I might say, well, it doesn't bother me at all or I might say it bothers me a three. You say, "Oh, three. Okay, great." Let's do little more tapping. We might find out little more about what… what's the three. How much does that bother you now? That's weird, it doesn't bother me at all. That would be a crazy simple example of how it works. But that's sort of what it looks like in its most simple, simple stripped down version and we'll… we'll go more into it as we go through it. Now we're talking about trauma. So again, I just wanna… just we're not gonna go over this whole big thing, but I just want to mention that this is something I always talk about, it's in… it's in my book "Tools for Transforming Trauma" but we're not… Basically, the bottom line is somebody has some kind of experience that we're gonna call traumatic. It hits the system, these are various things that matter and basically what happens is, you know, when people get PTSD, they can't regulate their effect, they can't manage what they're thinking, and they try to avoid what's going on. And what happens is this is an overtimeness. You don't, you know, if you walk… if I walk down these steps, I trip, I break my leg, snap that kind of trauma happens in a heartbeat. But PTSD generally doesn't work that way, something may be very specific but it's sort of evolves, it develops over time. And basically, after these things, you get people who will either have a positive resolution or pathological resolution, and really our job is to affect these things, and what I'm gonna here to tell you about is that energy psychology approaches work really well on these three things so that the adaptation moves that way. So that's our very big frame about how we're thinking about trauma, but it's very important to realize that trauma, what we call PTSD, is not a thing, okay? You know, the DSM is not real, right? You know, it's not the truth. These things they're just constructs. They don't exist outside of the way, we think about them. There's a series of things we put together and they evolve over time and we can influence how they… how they show up. Now the other thing that's interesting to know about, well, let me ask you a question. Here's the question, yes or no question. Does the past have any influence on you? If you think it does, raise your hand. Wrong. The past has no influence on you whatsoever, I submit to you but I will submit to you is your memory of it does and how it's stored in you. So the past has no direct influence but the way it is coded in us, big influence. And so from an energy perspective or from an energy psychology perspective, traumatic events are actually not seen as the real source of the problem. And by the way, if I think if you're an (inaudible) into fewer constructivists, you would say the same thing, the real source of the problem from an energy psychology point of view is that there is a energy disruption in the system, or if you don't like the word energy which we'll get to there is some disruption in the system. Hence, you know, that's why it's important to realize "t" events can sometimes have big effects because if you think about it, not everybody gets… If it was just about the event, then the same events that have the same effect on everybody, right, if it's… if it's in the event, but it's not in the event, it's in how it's… it's… it's in us. It's how what happens to us. So the question is why does event A cause trouble for person B but not for Person C? That's an interesting question, right? So here's a little math. Now see this must be true 'cause I made a formula, but… but it's a nice way of thinking about it. Come on, why (inaudible) working. So the energy or the intensity of the energy and the trauma, the experience of the trauma, how big it is, if you divide that by the resources that are available to the person at the time. Now, you know, we're just making it whatever these numbers are so somehow you could measure the intensity or the… of the event of the traumatic event and you would have to divide that by the energy of the resources available to the person at the time, that's important, has to be available, yet to have access to it. If that's greater than one, meaning, if there's too much entered, the trauma is bigger than the resource, you get us and that… that is you get a disruption to the system and that's the… that's the culprit. That's the bad boy you wanted. Come on. Well, that angle thing is the thing we want to treat, not the event itself. Does that make sense? So it's just a way to think about it because that's how… that's how we can get these kind of effects very quickly and how other approaches can get effects very quickly too. So we want to work on what's in the system. Now I'm gonna come back to that a little bit in a minute, but I want to talk to you just a little bit about the research 'cause we said we're gonna do it. So thereby says, well, we need research. Oh, energy psychology, that's all that tapping stuff, all that's a woo-woo, it's all placebo effect. Or you name it, it's been said, it turns out that there are over 100 studies and articles, reviews that have been published in professional peer reviewed journals, and most of them and then the last really 10 years frankly. And of those, there are randomized controlled trials, that's the, you know, the important thing if you're a research person. And there have been 39 outcome studies as well that are not randomized. And the bottom line is that basically 98% of these… of these studies have had positive findings, and they're… have had positive findings. I mean, that's just crazy. But that's… that's the end of the two, that didn't, they didn't really have non-composite, they just were sort of weird and strange and so I'm gonna… I won't take it, we won't go into them. But basically, the research has been, they've done by many different people, I think across seven continents or 12… 12 countries all over the place, many different forms, PTSD, depression pain, you name it, there are these really amazing results. And by the way, you can find all this stuff on our website at energy psychic… EnergyPsych.org/research. And there have now been four meta analysis done on this and they're pretty interesting. There was one, and they're all noticed the dates, right, I mean, they're all brand new. So (inaudible) they did one on… on anxiety and they had a Cohen's d of 1.23, which is a large effect size. For those that you are not statistically minded, in the old days, you wanted to see things that are P less than 0.05. That meant, that was statistically significant. These days what we want to see something called effect size, you want large effect sizes, which means it's robust, it's not just a statistical thing, it actually has impact in the, you know, in the clinical world. And for psychotherapy, a lot of psychotherapy is considered okay if you have moderate. You'd like large, but a lot of psychotherapy have moderate effect sizes. But D, Cohen's d is… is the one that people use most, I think anything above 0.8 is considered 0.8 and a large considered large. Then (inaudible) did a review on depression again, large effect size. So these are across 20 studies. (inaudible) mentally now, these guys are interesting because look at the journal, these were not friendly folks. And even they found a moderate effect size and they're using something called, umm… Oh, crap. It's (inaudible) I forget the name of it. It's a stricter, it's tighter, it's a little bit more stringent measure. And what's interesting about this study is they threw out the two best studies because they claimed that they were outliers, which I've talked to my statistician friends and like now that's not really cool. But even… But even with that, they still found that. And then there's a new one coming out, but again with nouns, it's not even out yet, it's going to be published in, I think it's in January, smaller study, smaller "n", umm… I'm not sure that N's right. I think there should be a zero there, 270. And then there's a large effect size, 2.96. So basically the research seems to show pretty, pretty well as well as any research can and there you can always find, you know, there's always problems with research but it seems to point in the direction that this stuff is pretty darn helpful. So for those of you who practice this stuff and says what's the research, you can say, there's four meta analysis that support this research, there are like 80, it's actually 82 studies and there's a review, you know, David Feinstein has a great review and the… and… and the… and, umm… the review of General Psychology in 2012, which is like the flagship of the API.

ROBERT SCHWARZ So I mentioned this earlier, prolonged exposure has their research that they tend to use. It's 12 sessions for prolonged exposure versus the research that has 6 sessions for EFT, you have 86% success rate versus 50% success rate. That's pretty interesting, folks. I don't get why the, uh… why… why the, uh… VA isn't more curious about this kind of stuff. But this is brief therapy. I mean, six sessions. You're… You've twice as six 60 minute sessions versus twelve 90-minute sessions, lower dropout rates, less pain, umm… And I just wanted to point this out, this… So this was the original research this… that… right there, they found there 59 veterans, they all had, you know, PTSD scores greater 50. By the end of the six sessions, they, umm… no longer, you know, they were below the 50, they no longer had a clinical diagnosis. After six… After six months 80% still below clinical levels. So this is like a big deal. Journal (inaudible), they replicated church, I don't think it's been actually published yet, I know it's been presented. Six, one hour phone or office sessions, again, you know, the symptoms went down and they rated Cohen's d 3.44. That's a huge treatment effect size. And again at 6 months, 95% no longer met clinical criteria for PTSD. So, you know, pretty… pretty heavy duty stuff. Do we have to use the term low energy (inaudible). So some people really don't like the term energy psychology. There's a history, I mean, it came up because people were using these points and they were meridian points and Fred Gallo coined the term energy psychology. Do we really have to use this? No, you don't. But really what's so weird about energy, let's take a moment and discuss this. We know the body has multiple systems, you know, you've got a circulatory, endocrine, lymph, nervous, we know the nervous system, come on. It's electrochemical and electromagnetic. This is mainstream science, folks. Nerve transmission, electro-chemical, membrane potential, we're talking energetic terms, EEGs, again, energy, EKGs, electromagnet energy, electrical stimulation in wound healing. This is something that the army uses to this day. So really energy is not all that weird. And as a matter of fact if you want to read a James Austin is one of the great writers who writes on the science of all this stuff, if you look at the taken as a whole, the connective tissue of the body, is the largest organ of the body and it's made up of collagen, and which is the most abundant protein in the body. And it turns out that collagen is a semiconductor. So, you know, what that means, right? It means, we're electrical. Now I have some volunteers. Where are my volunteers? The three volunteers. I'm gonna show you what I mean. If you guys could just… I think if I had come up on the stage real quick, my three volunteers. And I'm gonna show you what we're talking about. We're going to (inaudible) kumbaya moment. Now I have this thing here called an energy stick and what you have… Yeah, great. So hold hands, we're gonna make a circle. Very good. No, no, no. I'm coming in. Now… You're gonna hold hand. Grab that. No, I'm just kidding. All right. Now watch, now watch very carefully. All right, ready, put your hand up, put your hand up and touch my hand. So what does this mean? It means that we're completing a circuit. It means our body… Remember, I said we're… we're semiconductors. So we are electrical. Rock and roll, baby. All right, thank you, guys. There you go. Feel better. It's really not that weird, folks. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ So let's talk about EP and the mind-body connection because really in many ways, this is I considered the energy psychology of mind-body approach. First of all, I like, this is a fractal. This is the Mandelbrot set which these things just repeat if you know this stuff. This… This shape… There is that shape again and it keeps showing up. And what's interesting about the Mandelbrot set is it's infinitely… it infinitely repeats and yet there's a slight variation in each one. So it's infinitely the same and it's infinitely different, which I kind of like a lot. So the point is that patterns repeat on multiple levels, that's the thing I like to think about. And one of the things that happens with the mind-body communication is it's you just think of it as two-way communication. Actually, two ways that the right way to think of its multiple… There's multiple lines. Two… There are far more than just two. But mind communicates to body if you will, body communicates to mind. It's both ways. It's not one or the other. And it turns out that most people who are mind-body, they claim to be mind-body. They tend to have a bias, (inaudible) body people who, they're more body, they pay lip service to mind and then their mind people who are more than one mind people that pay lip service to body. But in fact they both are equally important and you can… This is the important point, you can run this system either way. So from a Chinese medicine point of view or, you know, if you tap on acupuncture points, you're going to change consciousness. If you change your consciousness, you're gonna shift the way, energy flows through the body. So you can run the system either way. Now we're talking about mind and body so that we have to talk about what's the mind. How many people know Dan Siegel's work? Raise your hand if you know Dan Siegel. Half of you. All right, we're gonna do the super clip… the super short version. Dan Siegel, I remember hearing this at a workshop, it was one of those moments when he was… he was up at… up on the sink thing and he has this stick where he goes… he goes, he's traveled around the world, he's talked to all the psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, whatever, they do psychotherapy which is what psyche… psychotherapy of the psyche, what's the psyche mind, and he says, "Okay, you do therapy in the mind, what's the mind" and 95% of people didn't have any answer to that. And so he and his colleagues got together and so the whole long story, they've come up with this definition of mind and he said this is their definition that scientists from all walk psychologists, socialists, physicists, chemists, biologists, anthropologists and so all could agree with that the mind regulates the flow of information and energy across time. I remember hearing that for the first time and went like this in mind, I kind of heard that… I heard it this way, you know, the mind regulates the flow of information and energy across time, across time, across time. That was my experience like back in my head. And I sat back in my chair, went into a trance and like couldn't move. It's like, oh, my god, this guy is saying this. And the mind is embodied and interpersonal. What does this mean? I don't… Basically, what he talks about is that the mind is an emergent property. In… In another way, it comes out of the body, comes out of this system of energy and information. If you're a physicist, you know there are only two things in the world of really anything that's interesting and that's energy and information, period end of story, straight physics. So there is nothing new. There's no news here. This is we are a system of energy and information and out of this emerges this thing called the mind, but it's not caused by it. This is an important distinction. Your brain does not create your mind, at least from this position. Now there'll be some people who will tell you that's bullshit, but there are a lot of folks will say, you know that the brain is there, it's part of it. And again, where to go, it sort of arises as this property of this system and that it's both in the body, it's in body, so it includes our brain, it includes our guts, it includes all these various things that we're now learning about the human biome. And it is interpersonal that is between us, the mind is between us, and it's also… it's also in our environment. So culture shapes things among other things. There's a, you know, when people talk about alpha waves, you know, the alpha, when we go into alpha, our brainwaves it's around seven to eight hertz. It turns out that in between seven, eight hertz is… is the… the schumann resonance, schumann resonance which is the frequency that surrounds the entire earth. It's just… It's a standing wave. Accident, maybe, maybe not. Anyway, here's the important point. The mind arises from energy and information flow and then it shapes it across time. So what our mind does is it shapes how we process energy and information over time. Makes sense? Now so that's our definition and so the question becomes why do some people develop psychological problems, like PTSD. You know, sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. And so… And so the answer is essentially there is a functional flow of information. It becomes dysfunctional. And what would data we'll talk about is, again, we don't… I'm just, you know, he wants to see everybody in the middle of the river of integration and not crashing up on the shores of chaos or rigidity, and Davin would argue that all psychological problems, all DSM diagnosis, can be characterized as either chaotic or rigid And PTSD actually turns out to be one of those things where you sort of bounce between both banks. You'll be chaotic and then you'll go rigid back and forth, but you don't stay in a granted. 

00:35:05

00:35:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ So the question is how trauma… How does trauma… (inaudible) trauma based problems develop and then we'll understand a little more about, especially from this energy point of view. So let me… let me point it out. So if some kind of event occurs, "t" or "T" and we said energy is disrupted by definition, an effect then dysregulates. And then what happens is the person's defenses increase, which gives you more energy disruptions and then the flow of information and energy either becomes more chaotic or more rigid you then have less access to your resources. And then what happens is you'll get less resourceful behavioral lifestyle choices, yuck self-narratives, right, which then leave you more vulnerable to more traumatic events, right? This is where you know the… the aces study comes in with people that have really childhood studied, you know, but the ace… the adverse childhood events. If you have a lot of adverse events in childhood, you're at just much more at risk for all kinds of trouble. In large part, you can argue because of this you… you… you… you… you have less resources and you make lifestyle choices that cause trauma. So how does energy psychology help you with this stuff? So for one we're gonna treat the energy disruptions via this tapping procedure, which is going to end up regulating effect, and then the defenses often. And then what's gonna happen is the flow of information and energy is going to become less chaotic and less rigid, and so the event is no longer upsetting and you person makes more resourceful behavioral lifestyle choices, you aid self-narratives and what that leads to is resilience. That's where we're going with this. That's the big frame. And you can do other things as well. You can add into that narrative works solution focused work as well, of course. Okay, so okay… So we've got this tapping thing which we're gonna get to in a moment, but how does that work really, what's the… Is there a science around it? And the answer is actually there's a fair amount of interesting possibility about that. And I want to frame it in two parts. The first is immediate trauma processing. So what happens is somebody has a traumatic event. How much does it bother you? You say nine. You do some tapping with them and within, I don't know 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 50 minutes, whatever, they now say it doesn't bother them at all. That's immediate. That's interesting. That's… But then the next question is also, okay, well, that's interesting, but how does that account for the fact that it stays gone because it does. It's… It's… It's not like, I mean, you could tap, person could feel better and then tomorrow, they will feel horrible again but that's not what happens. So let's break this down a little bit. So why does it, why do, you know, what accounts for the immediate trauma processing. One is reducing limbic arousal, the second is the restoration of ventral vagal control, this is Polyvagal Theory, which I'll get to in a minute. And then the third is intrapersonal down-regulation, and also stress hormone down-regulation. So those are the four reasons that this stuff works so quickly in the immediate… immediately. And then the question is why is it a permanent and that gets us to memory reconsolidation, and if I have some time this idea of epigenetic up regulation of immune response and down regulation of inflammation, there's some studies that… that suggest us of what's going on. So what's the research here? Let's talk about the limbic system. There was a 10-year study at Harvard that basically found that when you use stimulated acupuncture points, what happens is our friend, the amygdale will down regulate. So tapping or… or needling acupuncture points seems to cause the amygdala to down-regulate instead which basically tells the system, you know, there ain't no trauma here, you can relax. So that's interesting. These are the studies if… on your notes that if you want to look it up. So we have some people suggesting that this is tapping uh… down-regulates… down-regulates for the amygdala. I'm interested more in polyvagal theory. I just submitted a paper. I'm in a chapter on polyvagal theory about how this works. How many people know about Polyvagal Theory? Raise your hand. Only few. Great. Okay, well, so polyvagal theory. I'll be thinking about it tonight, by the way. I have a song called the Polyvagal blues. It's about a girl named Polyvagal. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:40:05
ROBERT SCHWARZ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible) in this type of study, is it during this presentation of… 

00:40:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ Right. So the question… Yeah, I know. These are… The question was about is it during like traumatic events, these are a series of studies with FMRIs and they're doing all kinds of things. So we're connecting a few dots so they found that they could down-regulate it and you can go deeper into it. It's not… These are… This is over 10 years and they did all kinds of interesting things. So we're kind of do… There's a certain amount of… of inference going on. So anyway, so Polyvagal Theory by Steven Porges if you go get us knew… If you get his book Polyvagal Theory is a great book but it's a really tough read, so I'm gonna condense this down the super hyper cliff note version for you and here's how it goes. So first of all, you had this thing called the vagus nerve or the vagus nerve bundle. It's a facial nerve, it runs from the gut up into the bottom of the limbic system. And it has old reptilian, the dorsal side, and then it has the new mammalian side which is the ventral vagal system. And it's first (inaudible) function frankly is to answer the question, "Am I safe?" That's what it does. Am I safe. You know, it doesn't use words, but that's what it's looking to do. And what it does and if it's… And what it does if it's not safe, uh… If you're… If you're determined that you're not safe, it gets the heart to do very well, if you're… if you're a reptile what it will make you do is freeze and play dead, right? But if you're… if you're a mammal, mammals are weird, we have these four chambered hearts. Well, our hearts are like racecars left to their own devices they'd… they'd go back, they really pound really hard and they burnout. Hence, there's this thing called the vagal braking system, which keeps the foot on the brake. So if you're calm and relaxed, like if you're calm and relaxed right now, your break is on, but if I scared you, the break would come… It's not that you put your foot on the gas, least not first, first the break comes off… the foot comes off the brake, right? And it turns out that the vagal braking system is a measure of affect… affect regulation and the state of your vagal nerve. And this ability as measured by… You can measure this by VBM stands for vagal braking system by heart rate variability and part of the research is that if you give, you know, if you hurt children and beat them up and do various kinds of things and do this to animals, there's all kinds of research that says when you… when you traumatized people, one at a body level, at a biological level, this vagal braking system becomes less operative and they can't recover as quickly. Hence part of when people are primed, you know, when people have histories of trauma and then they have that which is already a problem but then something happens over here, something new happens, and they can't recover as well. They don't handle it as well. Part of that is damage to the vagal braking system. And this is part of this entire bottom-up approach to trauma treatment, which all by the way is still not getting through to the APA because they just are released, these early findings, the division 56 on guidelines for… for PTSD and they're still back, they're still saying cognitive therapy and there's still same drugs and MBR gets a slight nod and nothing else got in there. So we… we've, you know, just another problem. But anyway, they're really behind the time. People like Bessel van, (inaudible) have been talking about this stuff for years. So trauma is a about is enlarged part of bottom-up kind of event. And the other thing to know about Polyvagal Theory is that when the vagal system is involved with social connection and social bonding, one of the ways, you know, about that is through prosody and tone. So you ever have people say, "Don't talk to me that way, don't use that tone of voice," even wonder why tone of voice matters, what's the biology of it. And the answer is that the vagus nerve goes right up past the vocal cords, so if you're upset and the vagus nerve is freaking out, guess what, it shows up in your vocal chords and that's why, you know, tone matters. So and you can run the system both ways. So if I'm upset, I'm stocking to them talking this way and I'm… And I'm going to communicate that to you and I'm gonna transmit that to you, but if I talk in a nice hypno voice it doesn't even matter what I say just like with dogs, "Oh, you're a stupid dog. You're the worst dog ever." You know, you'd say, but dogs 'cause it's all about voice tone. And it's… And that's why I don't know how Albert Ellis, Albert did hypnosis, you know, 'cause (inaudible) "So I'll go deeper and deeper into trance." I don't know how that ever works. But so, uh… So this… this idea of music soothing the savage beast is part of the vagal nerve function. It actually down-regulates the vagus nerve and causes us to believe to feel that we're safe, and it helps us then bond. So the problem is and then when we bond and this is part of (inaudible) notion interpersonal bonding also down-regulates the vagus nerve. That's why when you're stressed, what do you do? You want to hug oftentimes if you're not too stressed. That's why I need a hug. I need to be… I need to be regulated. That's why we still (inaudible) always still pictures of seals hugging together cuddling. It down regulates the system. That's why if I had a bad day, you know, I want to… I want to reach for that. The problem is if you get… If it's too blown out, then you can't… then you're not gonna want to regulate, then you're not gonna want to bond socially, so now you're even more at risk. So the bottom line is safety endangers a felt sense and this affect regulation and dysregulation is intrapersonal. And guess where that shows up, which is gonna become a parent. It shows up in the therapy room. So part of what happens with… with… with in treatment of trauma is there's a bit of a question who is gonna regulate who. If somebody starts to talk about their traumatic events, are they going to disregulate the therapist or is the therapist going to regulate them? Who's… Who's vagal system's gonna win? Who's gonna stay calmer? And that's an important consideration. And what I want to suggest to you is this tapping stuff has an impact on that. So that's our two-way communication which we've talked about. Here's my little comment about that with this therapist flow part. We'll complete this. So again, if you… This isn't working. If you have a client and so what we want his ventral vagal control. Ventral vagal control, that is when the when the nerve… vagal nerve is saying, "Hey, you're safe. It's okay, we're okay" Dorsal vagal controls is associated sympathetic arousal. So hopefully the high level eventually vagal regulation of the therapist and green is going to help the patient and not go the other way around. By the way therapists compassion has an impact on that, and again internally a client's level of negative self-judgment, it interacts all these kinds of things. So the more you're upset with yourself, the more you tell yourself you're stupid and dumb, you're the worst person in the world that is not gonna make you feel safe. The more you're connected to inner and outer resources, the more likely you're going to be calmer. And the more therapists guiding associations saw was earlier today was… was a solution focused therapy, workshop and they were talking all about, you know, that you're asking the kinds of questions that bring up resources and by asking those questions, you're guiding resources that help the client feel more connected which makes them more ventrally control in that dorsally control. So what's interesting to me is when I've gotten around, when I've talked to people, when I've trained clients in various energy psychology approaches and we say, okay, now we're gonna work… now we're gonna work on a traumatic event. Pair up, or getting three's, pick a problem invariably I see like this look of terror or fear showing up on therapists faces because they're afraid… I don't know if I get not a handle that. Now imagine that's what's going on with clients. If client starts to talk to you about a problem and you're afraid, oh, my god, what if I can't handle, you're gonna communicate that to the client. So that's one thing that's going on. But what happens when we do… when we do tapping usually at which we'll get to in a in a minute we're getting there is that usually the client's doing the tapping but guess what the therapist is modeling it for the client. The client and therapist is gonna do what I do, right? While we're talking about being raped by Cossacks or whatever, well, guess what the therapist is treating himself or herself. So the therapist is down regulating himself or herself at the exact same moment. So what helps the therapist stay calmer and they can stay more present and I've seen this again and again and again that I think there is something about this as sort of a when you're… when you're regulating yourself, you're modeling it for the client but you're getting more calm. Your body is staying more centered. And that's part of the hidden Juju if you will of why this stuff works so well. 

00:49:30
[sil.] 

00:49:35
ROBERT SCHWARZ So okay, you know, what this might be a moment, let's take a moment. If there are any questions, you can go over here, is this making sense, nod your head if it's making sense there. All right. Yeah, go to the mike. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. And so for example, I do like mindfulness or hypnosis with clients, I do the same thing because as I put somebody else in a trance. 

00:50:00
ROBERT SCHWARZ Right. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN I have to kind of chill out to down-regulate to use your… 

00:50:05
ROBERT SCHWARZ Right. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:50:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ I think other… No, right, this is not just, so if you're doing mindfulness, I've done hypnosis too. And then you sort of get into that space to absolutely, right. Absolutely. So this is part of what happens in the moment, but then the next question is, all right, well, why does this work, why does a person stay, why does the memory state completely process? Then after this, we'll go into some of the clinical stuff. I'll show you what it looks like. So there's something called memory reconsolidation. And this is really pretty interesting. So in the old days people thought that memory was like videotape. You know, it was laid down as on videotape, you play the tape, well, that's not how it really works. Memory goes in and out of store. And what happens is when you ask somebody to come to think of a memory or it just happens to come up, when it comes up, it comes up with everything associated. It comes up with your biology, it comes up with your effect, it comes up with all with everything that… that… that was there. And then if it's… if it's a flashback or an unprocessed traumatic memory, that's what comes up. And then if you work on it and the person's still in that state when he goes back in, guess what, he goes back in the same crappy way and you've just reinforced it. But if you call up a memory and somehow by hocus pocus or by whatever means, you can make that memory different, you can make it so that the person has different meaning, different reactions, it has a whole different experience if you could do that. And then it goes back into store… it goes back into store the new way and it's permanently altered. You got that? And so when it comes up again, it comes up the new way. And the new way becomes the old way. And so the trick is how do you do that? And it turns out there are few things you need to do. The first thing you need to do is reactivate or (inaudible) the event. Okay, well, of course, that's when you say, I'd like you to think of the event. And then you have to do is you have to create an experience that is at variance with the clients model and expectations of how the world works, right? And so what happens is, let me finish and then you have to either arrays or revise via new learning, which means you have to create a new experience that contradicts or supplant that labeled target knowledge. So something new has to happen and you have to do it by the way and it says here if it's the same as step three if you have to repeat step two several times. So you have to bring up the memory, it has to be somehow different, you have to do it a bunch of times. It has to have different meaning, different experience, and if you can do all that when it goes back into store, you've got memory reconsolidation, therapeutic memory reconsolidation. Well, guess what happens so when tapping an EFT for instance, you're going to call it the memory because I think about it how much does a body you're going to tap on the memory, they're gonna say, what it… what's it… what's it that now. The person says, it was a nine to seven. You're going to go through it a bunch of times and then at the end of it, you're gonna test the work 'cause then the person says, oh, it's how was the bother you, you know, it doesn't bother me at all. Then you accept (inaudible) go back and really think about it some more, really you sort of really wants to see is there anything that we didn't think about that, think about these different pieces. Remember when… when… when that person stabbed you, think about that. I got nothing. I am not bothering me at all. You do that a bunch of times, you're just done this a whole bunch of times. And so now when it goes back in the store, it's just gone. Not to mention the person's like, what the heck was that 'cause they've never had that experience. All right, I'm gonna skip that now. I'm gonna… I'm gonna show you one little video and then we're gonna show you some (inaudible) we're gonna show you a little bit about EFT and, uh… uh… and how it works and (inaudible) We're going till 1:45. When we go till? 3:15. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN 2:45. 

00:54:20
ROBERT SCHWARZ 2:45. Okay, good. So this is a… I want to show you a story, not a story, I want to show you a little movie about this one guy. His name is Andy. And this comes from a series called most operates in emotional freedom. Andy is that when you see in the beginning is going to look borderline psychotic. He has… He's been given about five or six sessions of EFT. At by the end of it, and you'll see. Now I'll call your attention something remember, I went through it real quick remember we talked about Polyvagal Theory and and we talked about the vocal chords and okay. Listen to the quality of his voice in the beginning and listen to the quality of his voice at the very end when he says the last few things. If you want to see the difference, when you want to see the body, the body aspect of this kind of work. So part of my point here frankly about I'd like you to learn energies psychology, but as long as you learn some kind of body oriented work, MDR is fine, somatic experiencing is fine, but for God sakes, it just, you know, this head thing, only the head, sorry, folks, like 25 years behind the times. 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN The medic that tie to work on king, (inaudible) somebody told me that he killed himself down (inaudible) because he couldn't take the, he couldn't take, could take that. 

00:56:10
[music] 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN Then a traumatic event, all the experiences are stored in memory as if that event is still going on. And in order to extinguish that relationship, one needs to extinguish the body's cues messages and memories that accompany that traumatic event. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN Energy psychology techniques use methods to rewire the disturbing and traumatic events that have been trapped in the body and mind. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN They head crawl, you know, up there. And when that power went off, he cut the fucking (inaudible) 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN You know, if you don't agree with me, I'm gonna kill you right here before he does (inaudible) things like that. It's just… 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN I could tell that there was something wrong and when we were both ours and he was in anchorage or something and we could get together and go to a restaurant or a coffee shop or something like that. Just when we walked in, he would have had to sit at a table with his back at eh wall. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Yes, we had this much and as we started tapping on various issues we got better and better. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN For me to feel that relax, even if there was no people in that restaurant. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN I was able to tap. I was my person. This is Andy Hod Nick and I'm gonna tap. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN When I leave the grocery store or wherever it is, and I get to home, I have that small euphoric feeling like I was out in society and I got a little bit of a positive vibe of good people that are out there in society. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN It takes the courage that with that warrior courage. The same thing it took to kill people or pick up your dead friend takes that kind of courage to help yourself. 

00:58:15
ROBERT SCHWARZ See what I mean, that's a calm, that's a calm body. How do you know of trauma is fully processed? And my answer is when you can think of the memory, you think of the experience, and your body acts as if you're completely safe. It has no reaction, it sounds like that. So that's what we're shooting for. So I'm gonna show you… I'm gonna go over a little bit what EFT looks like, the steps of EFT and what I want to do, I think… I think I've done this well… well enough that I have enough time that if somebody would like, I'm gonna do a little demonstration. So what I need is my needs so think about this in a minute is something it's got to be a short specific event because we only have a really gonna about 15 maybe minutes. It should be like if I asked how much does that bother you, you think about it and you just say like, oh, six or seven, eight (inaudible) I just… just for our time, I mean, you only have (inaudible) enough time. And it just something specific and short, so just keep that in mind when we get to it. And you'll have to sign a release. Okay, let me go back to… I got to go to this. Okay, so how do you do this thing. All right, for those of you… All right, so let me just go over the points. These are acupuncture points. You could put needles in them, we're going to stimulate them by tapping. So just so you for you that want to learn and the first point we're gonna talk is the top of the head point, it's sort of if you take your ears and go right above it's just a little bit behind the back of your head. So you just kind of tap here. So that's one point. That's called the top of the head point. 

01:00:00
UNKNOWN Which (inaudible)? 

01:00:00
ROBERT SCHWARZ It doesn't matter. That's our first… that's our first point. Another point people uses the corner of the eyebrow is it's inside of the eyebrow, that's another point, it kinda… you can do, so this is a mid… midline point. Some people tap one sided, some people go both sides. It's not the third eye, it's this where your eyebrow and so you would tap there. I gotta put my glasses on… I want to see (inaudible). All right. The next point is on the… these… these eye-for-eye points are on the orbit of the eye. You have this is right in the, right middle but it's the back of the bone. It's not in front it's behind. So it's slightly behind the bones, in the backside of the bone. Right? You don't… you know, don't just… you saw, you know, you don't need to do a whole lot. The third… the next point is… is vertically (inaudible) is dead in the middle and if you just rub your finger on your eye… on the… you'll feel a little indentation there. That's where the point is, you just tap there and again you can go both sides. The next point is under the nose, it's… it's… the next point is in the crease of the lip. It's here, it's not the Kirk Douglas point, you know, it's here. The next point is the collarbone point, this is the point that most people get wrong. It's kidney 27, for you, acupuncture fans. It is just… it is just… on the… on the underside of the collarbone just a little off the sternum. So I see people going all the way up here. It's just off center. There are lots of ways you can do it, I like to go tap people take the flatter their finger and just go slightly across. I mean, you could do it this way, just not comfortable. So you go like that, some people will go, well, they wanted to do both sides. That's fine. Just not here, it's… it's just, you know, just under the bone. And the other point, the last point we're gonna (inaudible) for now, there are other points, but this is the simple version is under the arm, it's four inches. It's… it's not up here, it's where the ladies have these, your bra strap goes or it's when guys cross-dress, you know, but it's and this is point actually gives us a pretty zests, because it's a deeper point and it's not on the face. All right. Not here, down here and there's one more point, so those are the points we… we use during and then there's one more point, it's called the side of the hand of the karate chop point. The actual point is if… if you fold a finger, there's gonna be a line that goes all the way to here, that's the actual point where that finger but you can just do this, I mean, that's kinda weird. You could do that. You can… you can go like this or some people like to get… if you want to get both sides at the same time, you go like this, that's the karate chop side of the hand point, so those are our… our basic treatment points. There are other points but for our purposes today, that's what we're gonna do. Got it? Good. So here are the steps, step one, you have to pick a problem. So it could be an rated from 0 to 10, so one thing might be, well, I'm feeling anxious right now, so that's a current like, I'm feeling anxious, or I have a craving for chocolate. Oh, it's okay. This is kind of a palliative approach, it's not the best, not the deepest kinda work, and if you're gonna say I'm anxious, you want to be like I'm… I have… I have this knot in my stomach, right, or my heart's pounding. You want… you still want to be as specific as possible. So maybe for anxiety, feel weak in the knees or you could say, "I'm anxious. My heart is pounding. I had this knot… and I have this knot in my stomach." How much that bother you? It's a seven. Or you could pick… pick a specific event like you know, the… my father was yelling at me that I was a complete idiot. All right. How much does that bother when you think about it, ah, I just… like, a nine. It's still drives me crazy. So that's our… that's our focus we gotta run. Then we have this thing called the setup statement. Now the setup statement is always the same, even though I blank… I deeply and completely accept myself. So let's come back to the blank. Even though, I basically have this problem, I deeply and completely accept myself, that's an interesting statement. What do we call that statement? Any CBT folks what? There's a certain… This fits a certain kind of therapy that's all up and hot, up and coming… Right… It's right. Or compassion is really… self-compassion therapy, it's also a kind of mindfulness. You're tuning into it, you're being mindful and you're being self-compassionate. So and you're going to activate, you're gonna use this karate chop point and you're gonna say, even though I am… you gonna put in the thing, even though… even though I'm feeling nervous and my heart's pounding, I feel I have a knot in my stomach, I deepened to accept myself. Or even though my father yelled at me, and I felt like, only two inches tall, I deeply and completely accept myself, would be a version. This setup statement is where it gets… this is where… this is where therapists document comes in. How you set this up? What you focus on? That's the only really interesting part for a therapist. Everything else a monkey could do. You know, it's… it's really a computer. Tap the points, no big deal, that you learned by (inaudible). There's nothing special there, but how you… where you focus, how you get in, that's what's interesting at least in EFT. So the first thing is you do that and in the old model… in old days people often will do it three times, even though these days people are doing it once. So you can say it once or say it three times. How do you decide? If I've… if I want to help someone tune in more, like attune more, I'll have say two or three times if they that their once. So they tune in, even though my father yelled at me and I felt like I was two inch and he called me a stupid, idiot and I felt two inches tall, I deeply and completely accept myself. And then we'd go through… then you go do the tap, then you just tune into it and tap, right. You go through the points. And then usually people will use reminder phrases. Well, they'll say things like, "My dad yelled at me. Dad yelled at me. I felt two inches tall. Two inches tall." You do not do the entire setup statement, you just pick, if you're going to do it at all, you're just going to say a few words to keep the attunement. People get all muddy about this like what (inaudible) what words did we use. The client's words just enough, just enough to attune. And frankly, sometimes just tuning and it's enough. Does that makes sense? So there you go through all that, that's our step three and then you say, okay. They… they go through, they tap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap… tap. Okay, Bob, what are you aware of now? How… how much does the (inaudible)? Well, it wasn't nine. Now it's… now it's a six. Okay? If it's six, it hasn't gone to zero, we would go back and we would start again with one little exception, or not exception, umm… adjustment. The question is what's the six? We don't know if it's the same set, we don't know if you seem in thinking about the same thing. So you remember I think, "Even though my father yelled at me and said I was a stupid and idiot. Well, if I just focused on that and I felt two inches tall. Well, actually that part now only bothers me a two, the sixth part it's about this other thing that went through my head that I wanted to kill him." I'm making this… I'm making this up, but so sometimes other things come up, so you have to check. If it's the exact same thing, it's gone down you go, fine, even though you just repeated, even though I still have this whatever, but if it's changed, you have to then change the setup statement. So "Even though my father yelled at me and I now… I really want to kill him, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Go around again, how much bother you now? Oh now it's only a two. Okay. You could stop, well, what's making it a two? And then he would go all the way down, hopefully all the way down to zero, that's what we're shooting for. Sometimes you can stop them they're variations on that, but that is the basic, that's the basic protocol there… there are… and I'm gonna talk a little more… if I have time, a little more about it, umm… as simple as this is… there's more advanced ways to do it in a way that really gets to clean out all the things. I will mention this one think, so I don't want to forget and then… then maybe I'll do a little demonstration. Let me… let me uh… Well, this is the thing I want to show, I forget this part. Umm… So this is a variation I did earlier, so this is something called "Tell the story technique", which is the main part, this is the workhorse of (inaudible), so for instance, in this story, uh… this is a, you know, this is father yells a kid at… at a baseball game. Father faces… his father's face as he walked up, Father yelling, "How could you miss that ball? How could you miss that ball?" Patients face gets hot and he wants to crawl under and lock and hide. And the father grabs and starts to pull him away toward the car. These are all part of a very short sequence and so you actually would treat, you don't do the whole thing. In… in a lot of therapies, you just do treat the whole thing and tell the story technique, you start with number one. How much does that bother you? Well, that's a seven. And you would… if you would work on just that part, get that all the way down to a zero before you did the rest. Because you're building up resources as you're cleaning out every little bit, so there's… there's this little chart that says, does the client feel intensity? If yes, stop, don't keep doing the story. How much is it identify? What is it about the father's face? Okay. We tap through… how much… Okay, it's fine. What's next? "Well, now he's yelling at me, how could you miss that ball?" Okay, we tap on that the words, well, what's that. You know, it was… Yeah, but his tone, it was the way he said it. Okay, we tap on that. And we go through it very slowly, until you get it all, but you don't go all the way through because what happens when you go all the way through too fast, is the client just gets re-traumatized. Does that makes sense? So I… and have to sometimes, the things that… when things are really, really tough, really hard events, you got to slow it down and break it into smaller… smaller parts. This is much more advanced than what I have. I just… I just want you to know about it. All right. Where are we in time? So picture's worth a thousand words. Does anybody have a very short small problem, you know, that… that might fit, that they… they think about they get like a… it bugs them, but it's not some giant thing, like it lasted only a few minutes, you got some… What do you got? Yeah, well, you raised. 

01:11:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:11:25
ROBERT SCHWARZ So your step dad scolds you, that's in current time? Okay. All right. Anybody… maybe anybody say anything else. Maybe from the… Yep… Yeah, what you got? Yep. You raise your hand. 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible)… 

01:11:35
ROBERT SCHWARZ Oh, I thought you had a… I thought you were volunteering. What… what is the event you want to tell me a sentence about? 

01:11:45
GINGER (inaudible)… 

01:11:55
ROBERT SCHWARZ Okay. That's interesting. How much? Well, you think about it now, how much does that bother you? Zero to ten, how much? All right, that sounds like fun. Now, you come on up, we'll do that. Now we might want to look at and have… Come on up. Yeah, so come on up and then, we might… we were gonna work on this current event, but dollars to donuts, there's, you know, some earlier event that this… and I may just go there, anyway, we'll see, that we might want to work on. Does that makes sense? Okay. Let me see where are we in time. How much time we got? 

01:12:30
UNKNOWN Fifteen. 

01:12:35
ROBERT SCHWARZ Fifteen. Ha-ha-ha. Brief therapy. 

01:12:40
[sil.] 

01:12:45

01:12:50
UNKNOWN You want his one? 

01:12:50
ROBERT SCHWARZ Yeah. All right. Here, you come sit right here. What is your name? 

01:12:55
GINGER Ginger. 

01:12:55
ROBERT SCHWARZ Ginger. Hi Ginger. Here go. 

01:13:00
GINGER Okay. 

01:13:00
ROBERT SCHWARZ So we're gonna try to keep so… you said, so you posted something then they posted something and when you think about it now… it still upsets you. It makes you mad as hell (inaudible). How much does that bother you? 

01:13:15
GINGER It's seven or eight. 

01:13:15
ROBERT SCHWARZ Seven or eight. 

01:13:20
GINGER Can you hear? 

01:13:20
ROBERT SCHWARZ Yeah, okay. And if you want… if we're gonna create this… if they posted it… Just tell me a little, so we want to create a setup statement. 

01:13:30
GINGER Okay. I… I posted something that really nailed Donald Trump in terms of the narcissistic personality and what to look for in the next four years. It was wonder. 

01:13:45
ROBERT SCHWARZ I'm sure… I'm sure it was. 

01:13:45
GINGER It nailed it and a friend of mine, wrote… but I said please read to everybody all my friends, and she wrote back and said, "Do not read." And I got very activated very quickly. 

01:14:05
ROBERT SCHWARZ So we can keep with that, but I… I have to ask, does that remind you of any earlier event where your friend… something about a friend turning on you or betraying you or was not what you thought they would be or… 

01:14:15
GINGER It was more that my father was Donald (inaudible). 

01:14:20
ROBERT SCHWARZ Okay. Your father was… 

01:14:20
GINGER That… that's what gets activated. 

01:14:25
ROBERT SCHWARZ So it's really about your father being a narcissist then even though my father was like Donald Trump? It's… there is nothing big about that? That's something specific. Do you have some… So… 

01:14:35
GINGER Yes, I do… I do… I do. 

01:14:35
ROBERT SCHWARZ What do you want to have happen, suppose… suppose we do this thing, the next thirteen and a half minutes and it works amazingly well, what would you like to have happen, what would be great that we could… for you as a result of this, right now? 

01:14:50
GINGER That, well, since it reminds me of my thought, since he reminds me of my father that when I look at him or see him on TV for the next four years that I'm not just like gonna into a state where, or just avoiding TV altogether. Just… I don't be extreme. 

01:15:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ Okay. Oh that's easy. (inaudible). Before I have to kill myself first. Okay. So just for the purposes of demonstration, I don't know how far we'll get, umm… if you… well, let me… let me… when you think about Donald Trump and he sees how much does that bother you when he goes on TV, 0 to 10? 

01:15:35
GINGER A lot of times the nine. 

01:15:35
ROBERT SCHWARZ A nine. And is there one thing about your… can you think of one specific event about your dad, small even that really epitomizes like if that this event still bugs you about your dad like some event that happened? 

01:15:55
GINGER Well, it's not an event but just he… his personality was very effervescent so he looked very charming and people loved him but he was like a bastard at home, awful and so it's that thing of nobody's gonna listen to you Ginger about who your father is? So half… half the country loves him and I'm wanting to scream. He's evil. Don't you people see that? And nobody will hear me. 

01:16:25
ROBERT SCHWARZ Is there… is there a some event where you really wanted to get someone either about your dad or other… you really wanted to tell someone your truth, maybe your mom or whatever, you tried to tell them and they didn't get it and that really bug the crap out of you? 

01:16:35
GINGER I didn't try to tell. 

01:16:40
ROBERT SCHWARZ But you never tried to tell? 

01:16:40
GINGER No. 

01:16:40
ROBERT SCHWARZ Okay. All right, so for you, it's what that even though, umm… 

01:16:50
GINGER I don't know if we're working with Dad or Donald Trump. 

01:16:50
ROBERT SCHWARZ I don't know, let me ask you a question. Probably dad but… 

01:16:55
GINGER I'd rather work with Donald. 

01:17:00
ROBERT SCHWARZ You rather work with Donald, fine. What you want to work with Donald? We wanna… we wanna do a group experience? All right. All right. Here's what we're gonna do. Good point, thank you for that. You're gonna tap along. Whatever we do, you tap along and do your own Donald Trump experience. All right. So we're gonna… we're just gonna like kinda go out. Let's do this. We're gonna… we're gonna go off script. I'm just gonna, we're just try to have an experience. So… so Donald Trump… when you think about it… it's a… 

01:17:25
GINGER Pathological liar. 

01:17:30
ROBERT SCHWARZ Right. Okay. So let's put this down for a minute. Well, just have you, I'm gonna have you… just do what I do, we'll see what happens. Tap beside your hand, everybody… Even though… 

01:17:40

01:17:45

01:17:50
ROBERT SCHWARZ Even though Donald. Yeah, there you go. Let's get a… if it's… if it's being recorded and it's being recorded. Okay there you go. So even though Donald Trump is a pathological liar… 

01:18:00
GINGER Even though Donald Trump is a pathological liar… 

01:18:05
ROBERT SCHWARZ And there's nothing I can really… There's not a whole lot I can do about it. 

01:18:05

GINGER I'm scared of Donald Trump. 

01:18:55
ROBERT SCHWARZ I wish I could calm down.

GINGER I wish I could calm down, wish I could quit hating. 

01:19:15
ROBERT SCHWARZ Wish I could quit hating. I want to give it some more points this because we all need have little finger, middle finger, index finger, thumb and the secret point the inside of your (inaudible), go further down, there you go. Okay. Take a deep breath. So think about this thing that normally gives you a nine, you can see Donald Trump or they talk about Donald Trump, what numbers at that now? Whatever it is in this moment, not what you think it might be tomorrow, right now. 

01:19:55
GINGER When I see him tonight on TV… 

01:19:55
ROBERT SCHWARZ No, no, no. Right. Yeah, imagine right now. In this moment. 

01:20:00
GINGER Right now probably… 

01:20:00
ROBERT SCHWARZ I can tell it's less in this moment. In this moment? 

01:20:05
GINGER Six or seven. 

01:20:05
ROBERT SCHWARZ Six or seven. And it's… it's kinda the same thing or just more of the same or has something shifted, like you're more aware of something else that came to the foreground. I'm so happy that I'm doing this. 

01:20:20
GINGER Well, (inaudible)… I think Robert you needed this as much as me, that's what I was thinking as we were doing, and I was going, "Ah, I think he's in this with me." 

01:20:30
ROBERT SCHWARZ I am. 

01:20:35
GINGER That's what… 

01:20:35
ROBERT SCHWARZ I think we all are. 

01:20:35
GINGER That what shifted was like. "Ah, I have a friend that is on the same page." 

01:20:40
ROBERT SCHWARZ Even though… 

01:20:40
GINGER Even though. 

01:20:45
ROBERT SCHWARZ I'm scared of Donald Trump. 

01:20:45
GINGER I'm scared of Donald Trump. 

01:20:45
ROBERT SCHWARZ And I'm still at a six. 

01:20:50
GINGER And I'm still at a six. 

01:20:50
ROBERT SCHWARZ I'm realizing that I'm not in it alone. 

01:20:55
GINGER I'm realizing I'm not alone in this. 

01:20:55
ROBERT SCHWARZ There are a lot of other people. 

01:20:55
GINGER There's a lot of other people. 

01:21:00
ROBERT SCHWARZ Maybe it will… it'll be okay at some point. 

01:21:00
GINGER Maybe it'll be okay at some point. 

01:21:05
ROBERT SCHWARZ Maybe not. 

01:21:05
GINGER Maybe not. But at least I won't be alone in it. 

01:21:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ But at least I won't be alone in it. And I deeply and completely love and accept myself. 

01:21:15
GINGER And I deeply and completely love and accept myself. 

01:21:15
ROBERT SCHWARZ Oh my God, Donald Trump. 

01:21:20

01:22:20
GINGER I just want to shake my head.

UNKNOWN So I guess this is sort of a question and a comment I used to work a lot with stalkers and stalking victims and I think one of the issues with stalking which would apply in the thing you just did, is not just that it's a onetime crime but it's… it's gonna keep going. And… and I think, the concerned… I guess the question I have you are dealing with something that was immediate in terms of feelings right now, but also is not over. The fact the… the trauma is we may say is just starting. 

01:26:40
ROBERT SCHWARZ Right. So if somebody is currently being stalked. And, you know, so there's… there's a lot of safety concerns, you still might want to treat them so they can be empowered, in fact that, I remember a person I worked with who launched, you know, her… her daughter was being stocks, she sort of… she got… she got attacked by her daughter's stalker, her… her… She was very traumatized but actually in her experience she was very traumatized but in reality, she kicked his ass, and by the end of it we did it… it was a whole different experience for her. She had a whole different meaning for her. So yeah, I mean, you definitely need to take care of it and you might have to… you might have to keep retreating or empowering somebody if they are dealing with a, you know, situation like that, sure.

UNKNOWN And Donald Trump's not going away anytime soon.

ROBERT SCHWARZ (inaudible) stalked. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. You got a question? Yeah. 

01:27:30
UNKNOWN So I'm interested in why the negative self-talk is being fired (inaudible) versus the opposite. 

01:27:40
ROBERT SCHWARZ Great question. Why are we using… why are we using positive effect? So what I will tell you is EFT as developed by Gary Craig was all it was never meant as this kind of installation procedure, it was more of being with what was… what is this… this sort of negative, and then de-potentiating(ph) it. So it's… you are not so, if you watch people on YouTube, you oftentimes see a lot of installation language, and we sort of did a little of that here, but more pure of EFT is being with this neck… this… this… these experiences that we're gonna label negative or negative self-talk and then what happens is as you tap, something shifted the energy flow and they fall away and the person is left open and free to then kind of step in with their own positive stuff, like I mentioned this experience with the… I alluded to… And here's another… here's another little bit. I'm gonna suggest to you for the kind of advanced comment, that one of the reasons that people do all the positive stuff is because they have an aversion to the negative, they're scared and that if you can stay with the deeply negative, the deeply fearful, the deeply not PC kinds of thoughts and feelings and be very present with the person when they're doing it, that is amazing therapy and then you're being deeply present, you're being deeply caring, you're being deeply loving, so are they… you're giving them the ability to stay with it because when they don't deal with that stuff, it becomes this little piece of something that's… that's buried in there and never quite heals. Does that makes sense? But if you stay with it and then you do this tapping which seems to make things move around and now they're free from it, now they're really free. So and I would submit to you a lot of the kinds of traumas that go on that a really tough, one of the reasons is that people have a very un-PC thoughts and very un-PC reactions that they really hate in themselves and we have to be willing to stay with them and… and… and so that's a great question and that's why you don't tend to run that so fast. Come to the microphone, where are we in time? I want to be respectful. Oops. Last question, then we got to stop. And it… 

01:30:00
UNKNOWN It's… it's not so much a question following up on the most powerful thing that I think eyewitnesses is the transfer of that idea of I'm not alone because (inaudible) in this bigger missing experience if you will. 

01:30:10
ROBERT SCHWARZ Yes, and so again, thank you. You know the real… Look, there's the technique of this but the thing I try to emphasize as you learn the technique and then you let it go, right, and this is… the real thing is being president, that was very obvious that sort of… that sort of came up from… that came up between us, that was… what was going on and that you could feel it. You could feel that was relevant. I felt at the minute she said it. I think most folks did. So it was like, "Oh okay, right," because we know… and that that made a difference. So a lot of the… the therapy even though there is a very technique aspect to this that you need to learn really once you learn, it comes up from… from the… from the relationship, so it's still about the relationship. Anyway folks, thank you so much for your attention.
