BARRY L. JACKSON Today our topic is Drinking and Alcohol Related Harm among Adolescents and Youth, Young Adults: Implications for Mental Health Services. Um, this is a much bigger issue than a lot of people realize. Nationwide, or worldwide, it is the more health risk situation in the world. And by that, I mean simply, we'll ask you to join the small table here. By that I mean simply that it now, alcohol use now, uh, is linked to more harm, health-wise, than smoking. And we all know the issues around smoking and we've considered smoking to be the number one health hazard. In fact, the World Health Organization's latest data shows that it is alcohol. So we're gonna talk a bit about that today and we're gonna talk about some solutions. I'd ask you to join the elite table over here. Uh, there's some, okay. Um, there is a little form on the table I'd like all of you to fill out. If you'd hand one over to this gentleman and one to this man. Uh, and we're gonna talk about that for a few minutes, and then we'll get into some other information. But as way of introduction, we're gonna look at comparative rates of alcohol consumption worldwide. Not all countries have reports, so we don't have all that information, and I'll give you some caveats about the data itself a little bit later. We're gonna look at the causes for the rates of increase. We're gonna look at alcohol-related harms that we can identify and then look at some harm reduction methods. And that, that's, I think, the important piece, so I'm gonna try to get through the first three areas fairly quickly. And this is information that is on the disk that you've all received. And you might want to use some of this information for awareness activities in your community. I would recommend you do that. I have no problem with it other than please cite me and, and indicate where you've gotten the information. Um, so let's, let's, uh, first look at, let's first look at what you've written, uh, little form you filled out. Many of you are abstainers, so it's gonna be interesting to use this data. How many of you are abstainers? Okay, three out of seven. 

00:02:55
BARRY L. JACKSON Except for tonight. Oh, okay. 00:03:00]Uh, if you'd like to. Yes, okay. One. Okay. Eight. Okay. All right, eight, non-standard. Okay. Okay. Cups? Oh, okay. All right. Um, this little instrument I use, uh, with professional people a lot, and the reason I do is because professionals who are out there, counselors, physicians that I'm working with in New Zealand, are out there, they're the ones that are going to be educating their patients, their clients to excessive drinking. And what I've found is that they don't have that information themselves. I was explaining before we got together, uh, there was a workshop, one of the things that I saw with some physicians as I was doing training for them was that they went through and put down the standard drinks they, or the number of drinks they have on a Monday and a Tuesday and a Wednesday and Thursday and a Friday and a Saturday, just as I've asked, and a Sunday. Is there anybody who wants to volunteer what they drink. Now you're gonna be filmed. Okay. You don't drink at all. You, oh, okay. You're gonna be filmed, so I have to, you know, warn you about that. I'm supposed to, have informed consent, okay? All right, everybody heard that. I don't, I don't have any documents written, but it's informed consent. Okay. How many drinks do you have on a Monday, usually? 

00:04:25
[sil.] 

00:04:30
BARRY L. JACKSON Okay. Okay, none on a Monday. So we got zero. Tuesday? Wednesday? Thursday? So you're having about 10 a week? Okay. Are they standard size? 120 ml. Okay. Okay. All right. This and add. Uh, okay. Anyone else like to volunteer? Would you like to volunteer? Yes. And remember, I have to give you the informed consent, you're on camera. I didn't ask for your name. Yes.

Data Considerations Data for the following tables were obtained from the World Health Organization and the United Nations' data bases. Nations do not always provide information in the same or similar manner. These data reflect registered alcohol sales.

Factors Effecting Information Quality of Surveys Usually Localized Quantity of Surveys Inconsistent Time Frame Definition of Youth Who? 10-29 years old 

00:05:20
International Drinking Ages No minimum Age: New Zealand Age 16: Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, Romania, Spain Age 18: Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Poland, United Kingdom, India Age 19: Nicaragua, Canada, Korea Age 20: Japan Age 21: United States, Indonesia 

00:05:20
Pacific Region Australia 25% of 16-17 year olds reported hazardous drinking in previous month New Zealand 16-17 year olds 26% of males reported hazardous drinking in previous month 21% of females reported hazardous drinking in previous month Korea (Seoul) 28% of 14-18 year old students had consumed alcohol in the last week 

00:05:20
South East Asia Sri Lanka: 93% of 18-24 year olds are lifetime abstainers Bangladesh: 95% of 18-24 year olds are lifetime abstainers Thailand: 89% of 15-21 year olds had had alcohol in the past 3 months India: 93% of 15-19 year olds are lifetime abstainers Indonesia: 93% of 15-19 year olds are lifetime abstainers 

00:05:20
Africa South Africa (Cape Town) 31% of high school students reported past month alcohol use Nigeria 13% of high school students reported past month alcohol use Egypt 99.7% of 15-19 year olds reported never using alcohol 

00:05:20
Latin America In Latin America and the Caribbean, 4.8% of all deaths and 9.7% of all disability-adjusted life years lost in the year 2000 were attributable to alcohol consumption. Making alcohol the most important risk factor for a burder of disease, surpassing smoking.

BARRY L. JACKSON Okay. Anyone else that drinks more that wanna volunteer? Okay. Um, you're not, you're not a good group to do this exercise with because you're not the average drinker. And what I found was, uh, in New Zealand and elsewhere, that people don't know what a standard drink size is. In fact, I had dinner here last night and I had it early and then I went to the reception, not realizing there was going to be a lot of food and I wouldn't've had to buy dinner. Um, and, uh, at dinner I had a glass of, uh, dry white wine. And it was not 120 ml. It was probably 200. I went to the reception, and I got this beautiful red wine. Oh, it was just gorgeous. And it was in a glass with that much alcohol in it. How many drinks is that? And that's clearly not one standard drink. Um, what I'm trying to illustrate is that most of people who are drinking do not pour a standard drink. And so when they tell me they had only two, one, you know, while they're getting dinner ready and then they sat with their husband or their wife or their partner and they had a second glass of wine. And I say, "Well, how many, how many, you know, glasses do you get out of that bottle?" "Oh, four or five." Well, you're supposed to get eight. So four or five, uh, means you're drinking twice as much as you think you are. And that's what I've found even with the professionals. So when you're telling me they have two on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, they're out with the girls or out with the guys, you have, um, you know, a terrible shift at the hospital and they have a couple white wines and then they have dinner and a little bit of wine and maybe, you know, an aperitif. And then Saturday is the rugby or the cricket or, or the regatta, the Americas Cup, and they've either won and they drink a lot or they lost, like they did, um, uh, and I'm not a big regatta fan, so I'm not plugging the Americans. But they, they drink this and then they say, "Well, but I only had 12 standard drinks in a week." And then we, or 12 drinks in a week. And then I look at standards, and then what we see is they had 24, 25, or more. And then they begin to step back and say, "Wow, I didn't realize I was doing that." And what I was able to point out to them is that if you're not aware of it, clearly your patient or client is not aware of it. And when they report to you that they're only drinking 30 in a week, and you think, well, 30's a lot. Keep in mind it may be 50 or more if it's not standard. So two lessons here. One is be aware of your own behavior and be aware that what your clients are telling you is probably not reliable. That's not even, you know, including the, deliberate attempts to deceive you. They're deceiving themselves because they really don't know what the standard drink size is. So that's important caveat that we start with. Now, what I'd like to do is, um, I'm going to go and, into the workshop. I just wanted to set the stage with that so that you have some information and can look at what's really going on. The data that we're gonna present here comes from the World Health Organization and other international bodies. How reliable is it? Well, how reliable is your self report from your clients? There are all kinds of problems with these data. However, they're the best data we have. So keep that in mind, and if you want to be critical, be critical of the data, not of the presenter. Hello. Please join us up here. There's room right here for you. Um, and we'll get started with this. Um, some data considerations. I was implying some things about those and I'd like to tell you a little bit more. Because nations either do not maintain records, uh, or they maintain them in various formats, varying formats, these organizations' databases are proximal. They're not accurate in many cases. Also, nations report registered alcohol. What is registered alcohol? Alcohol that is legally sold, taxed, and counted. It's, it's bottled and they know how much it is or it's put in cardboard crates or whatever they do. In America they sell wine in a cardboard crate. It's, it's just wonderful. Um, uh, but anyway, many countries don't include estimates of non-registered alcohol. So I do a lot of work in Eastern Europe and Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania. Their data are much lower. Why? Because people are brewing and drinking on their own. No one knows about it legally or officially. It is legal to do so. And that results in lower numbers in some cases. So as we go through this data, keep that in mind as well. Some nations that appear to have lower rates than other nations may be more an accounting error than reality. Okay? Um, so the quality of the surveys is also an issue. There are localized surveys. The World Health Organization has put out a form that they like people to use, like countries to use. It's not necessarily used because the data isn't necessarily collected in the same way. Um, I'd ask you to come on up and join this table here. Um, the qualities of the surveys, how they're, you know, obtained. Were they obtained in a supermarket or are they obtained by telephone calls? How are they obtained? And a consistency of time frame. Uh, you know, if you collect it the day after New Years, it may be very different than if you collect it in, uh, during Lent when some people have given up alcohol for, for Lent. So the timing of these is, is difficult. And most of these data are collected in different nations at different times, so they're not comparable in those ways. Finally, when we look at the youth, there's a problem because different cultures identify youths at different ages. Anywheres from 14 to 25, and I have to be really direct about this. Some of the cultures that I've spoken in some of the countries, um, Malta being one, uh, that I recently completed a study on, we found that, um, a very high percentage of students had already consumed alcohol before age 9 to the point of intoxication. Um, so the definition of youth and adolescent is, is differ, different in different cultures. So again, the World Health Organization recommends counting it from 14 to age 25. Lot of cultures consider you an adult at 18. So there's some data inconsistencies. Let's just look at some international drinking ages. Uh, New Zealand, uh, there is no minimum age. You can drink at any age you want publically. There are some restrictions coming into play now. Various councils, Wellington Council has just passed some rules and regulations that in a downtown business, business district and in a restaurant areas, you have to be a certain age and you can't, um, be over a certain level of intoxication or you'll be arrested for public intoxication. New Zealand, until just recently, had no laws for public intoxication. None. They had them in the 80s, up to the 80s, and then they abolished them. And we'll talk more about the reasons behind that. Age 16, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, Rome, uh, Romania, excuse me, Spain. There's some of them. 18 is Brazil, Mexico, Australia, um, the United Kingdom, India. The United Kingdom made some changes just a couple years ago that allowed people to drink 24 hours a day. Remember, they used to have the, uh, closing time at 10:00 and then they moved it to 11:00, and now there's no closing time. None at all. And what they hoped when doing that was that they would eliminate, uh, binge drinking and they would reduce drinking in all. Uh, that's not happened. What's happened is the total consumption has gone up dramatically. The retail outlets love it. The police are not so happy. Uh, now they have drunks on the road at 5:00 in the morning instead of 2:00 in the morning. So it's, it's a, some changes. Age 19, Nicaragua, Canada, Korea. Japan is 20. United States and Indonesia are 21. They're the oldest permissible states, um, in, in the world. And do they make a difference? Well, there's a question about that. Australia, uh, Pacific region, wanted to talk a little about that. 25% of all 16 to 17 year olds reported hazardous drinking. And hazardous drinking has been defined by WHO based on data from the United States indicating that four or more drinks for a man in a day, three or more drinks in a, well, more than three for a woman, more than four for a man in a day, or a "sitting," as they call it, is considered hazardous drinking or "binge drinking." Lot of debate about why that number came about. Uh, I won't get into that. Just that's the definition that's being used. In general, women can consume about 80% of the alcohol that a man can at the same body weight to get the same level of blood alcohol. And that's how we look at this 5/4, 4/3, uh, drink ratios. So if you keep that in mind and then follow those data, you'll see where the rational from the World Health Organization comes. Um, New Zealand reported 26% of its males had hazardous drinking in a previous month, 21% of its females in a previous month. Korea, 28% of 14 to 18 year old students had consumed alcohol in the last week. Sri Lanka, 93%, um, of 18 to 24 year olds are lifetime abstainers. Bangladesh, again, a very high lifetime abstainers. Thailand, uh, no abstention there, folks. India, a large percentage, 93%, and Indonesia, a large percentage of lifetime abstainers. If you look at this, it's not surprising to recognize that those countries that have a high Muslim population, Islamic population have low consumption of alcohol rates. Why? It's prohibited. It's prohibited by their, uh, religious beliefs, and so you see low rates. So again, not, not a surprise. By the way, where we see low alcohol rates, we see high incidence of gambling. Much higher incidence. Kind of interesting. Africa, South Africa, Cape Town, 31% of high school students reported alcohol use in the last month. Nigeria, uh, 13%. And Egypt, 99.7% are abstainers. Latin American, uh, Caribbean states, um, 4.8% of all deaths and 9.7% of all disability-adjusted life years lost in 2000, and this data only came out in 2006, so it's only reported every 10 years and it takes five to six years to actually get into the public, uh, domain. So when you look at the data and say, "Well, boy, that's really late. That's 13 years ago." That is true, but it's the best data that's currently available, which is sad. Uh, but if you look at the percentage of people who are disabled or dead based on alcohol, it is huge, making alcohol the most important health risk factor for burden of disease now surpassing tobacco. According to the physicians with whom I work, uh, and the World Health Organization, between 40 and 50 known disease courses are directly related to alcohol. Alcohol is a major contributor to cancer. So when we look at what, um, the health risks are and some of the social costs, and we're gonna do that in a little bit, you'll see they're really enormous. The implications for our societies are phenomenal. This figure shows use in the past 30 days in South America. You can see some of the rates. These are just use rates. This is not intoxication rates.

00:19:10
BARRY L. JACKSON This is rates in the last 30 days. Um, in most cultures, and there is an exception, which is important to you, and I'll point that out in a moment, in most cultures, uh, the men are outdrinking the women, particularly in this young age group. Now, drinking rates in the United States, Europe, uh, Middle East, Russia, Eastern countries, here they are. A little complicated, but it is on your disk. Uh, I would point out, uh, Australia is not on here. I've had people say, "Well, where's Australia?" and they say, "Oh, there it is!" That's not, that's not Australia. It's Austria. So don't, don't confuse that, okay? Um, out of all these nations, Turkey has the lowest rate. There's Turkey. Um, here's another low rate, Iceland. Um, by and large, if we drew a line, we'd say 50% or more of people were drinking worldwide in the last 30 days. That's a rough estimate. Now, let's look at intoxication. 50% of the world is drinking in the last 30 days, uh, somewheres around, if you look at these numbers, somewheres around 30% are reporting intoxication. Now, again, intoxication levels are interesting because, um, if somebody has a tolerance and they're self-reporting, their BAC may be, Blood Alcohol Content, may be, uh, legally intoxicated, however, they don't report it because they feel okay. They have tolerance. The other issue is, yes? Iceland has a very low prevalence reported of drinking. Yes. Yes. Yes, and that's a point I'm going to make here, and that's a very good one, because that is exactly what I want to point out. If you look at some of these rates, uh, Turkey had a low, the lowest of all the reported, uh, incidence for, um, drinking, and they have the lowest reported incidence for intoxication. Approximately a third, uh, a little bit more than a third of those who drink in Turkey drink to intoxication. Now before we get back into that intoxication, not every country calls intoxication the same level. Some are a .05 BAC, .05%. Um, the United States, we have a couple states that have .05% as their level of intoxication. I don't know what that translates in terms of, um, grams and so on in yours. But .08 is approximately, that's most of the states in the United States. That's equivalent to what you have and New Zealand has, okay? But some countries are .10. United States until about 10 years ago was .10. So we're not even talking about the same legal limits, okay? So again, the disparity in the way the data is collected, how you make the measurements, all of that exists. But your point is well taken. If we look at some of these countries, um, you're going to see, Iceland is there, Denmark, very high rates of intoxication. Cyprus, really low. The United States is actually fairly low. When I started doing this work about 20 years ago with university students, and that's my principal group for a very long time, uh, I thought, "Oh God, we must be the worst drinkers in the world! Look at all these students!" I mean, every weekend they're, they're, uh, intoxicated. And they have many other words for it, um, most of them which aren't polite to get videoed. Uh, but I was fascinated when I began to look at what we see in other cultures. I did a stint in England for a while and I, I couldn't believe. Students were going out for a couple beers between class. And they weren't alone; their professors were with them! I went with them! I just didn't drink because I, I thought, "How am I going to go back and teach after two pints?" You know? I could barely stand up after two. Um, I'm an old man with low tolerance. Uh, but there is an inverse relationship in many of these countries, low drinking rates and really high intoxication rates. And it gets complicated further by this. When we look at some of these, this is the overall population, not the youth population. And what we found in research is very interesting. Young people and old people drink very differently. Okay? And I'm seeing this in every culture. Younger people, 25 and under, tend to drink all their alcohol in one or two nights. And they start on a Thursday or a Friday, you know. In the States, in college they call it Thirsty Thursday, Freedom Friday, Saturated Saturday, uh, and Sobering Up on Sunday. So, uh, it's very different. Those students may drink in a week only the same amount as an adult drinks, another, in the rest of their culture. But the difference is, they're drinking it in one or two nights, and the adult population tends to spread it out over a whole week. And the other thing we see is what we would call, uh, uh, a bifurcated, ignore that for a moment, a bifurcated kind of sample like that. A double-humped camel, so to speak. And what you see is low age comes up, and up in here you get, somewheres around 18 to 25 and are drinking heavily, and it starts to taper down a little bit. And it goes way down like this and it goes back up. This trough here is very interesting. That trough has been shifting further up, age-wise. Anyone wanna guess why? Why the trough exists in the first place? 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
BARRY L. JACKSON Okay, anybody else wanna add to that? 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:15
BARRY L. JACKSON Yes, and again, that's, that's a population that's different than much of the world. The reason is simple, and you're partially right. The other reason, it's not just 'cuz they get more sensible, they get a job. They, they leave university, they get a job, they get married, they have kids. And what we know about drinking behavior is as people take on these quotes, "adult responsibilities," drinking drops. So one of the things that's happening in Western culture in particular is that we have extended youth well beyond the days when our parents were considered youths. You know, think about World War II. The average age in World War II for Western troops was under age 20. In World War I it was around age 18. They were adults. They were treated like adults. They expected the behavior, you know, they were expected to behave like adults. We have extended young adulthood into the mid-20s. In Ireland it's very common not to leave home until you're in your late 20s. I saw this in Eastern Europe. And if you're a woman in Eastern Europe, you can be in your 30s and not have left home yet because you haven't found a man that's gonna take care of you. Talk about chauvinism. Um, and I see this in other cultures. Malta as well and, and other Eastern European countries. And I mean no disrespect to them. What we're looking at is simply a prolongation of when you become an adult. And as long as you're in that, quotes, "youthful" population, they tend to drink more. Once they get out and get, have to get, get up and go to a job at 8:00 in the morning, or 7:00 if you're in construction, they can't stay out until 2:00 in the morning and drink and keep their job very long. So they alter their behavior. What happens after that trough? Well, they start to go back up. And why? Because now they're establish, their children are getting a little bit older, they have a little more discretionary funds, and they begin to drink socially and they drink a little bit more socially and a little bit more, to the point where they're drinking almost as much or about the same as their children, who are now binge drinking, by the way. Their 14, 15, 16 year olds are now out there drinking a lot, and they're doing it all in one or two nights while Mom and Dad are spreading it out all over the week. So they're drinking about the same amounts. Which is riskier for your health? Well, the binge drinking. But the older we get, heavy drinking is not good either. So there, there're some issues. But that's a pattern we're seeing all over Western Europe, all over New Zealand. I don't know about Australia. I honestly don't know. I suspect it's probably the same, but I don't know. Now, has that changed at all with the poor economy? No. What's fascinating to me is that the poor economy hasn't stopped drinking. In fact, we see more drinking in both groups, which has an implication from my perspective about increasing the price of alcohol. They say, "Well, if we increase the price of alcohol, we decrease its consumption." You know, that sort of begs the question. If people have less discretionary income to buy alcohol and are still buying it and in fact buying it in greater quantities, will raising the, the price really push it down? I don't know. I mean, I've seen research where they said it has. My own state of Pennsylvania says it has. Um, I just wonder if in Pennsylvania all my fellow, uh, residents drive over to New Jersey and buy it cheaper, or New York and buy it cheaper. I, I don't know. Uh, in good time. His comment is in good times people might actually drink less. Lower anxiety, lower depression. I, I, I don't know. We don't really have good data. I've seen some research on it, about the price factor. And SAMSA, our national agency that keeps, uh, this kind of data indicates that it is, but this, this latest data really begs that question, I think. And I don't have the answer to it.

00:30:50
BARRY L. JACKSON Okay, let's look at this. Um, again, we do have Australia here. This is not Austria this time. Look at this. These are women, these are men. Your women in this country are outdrinking the men in episodic binge drinking. And if you look at every other culture, where are the women? You don't have as big a drinking problem as some other cultures, but in terms of who's drinking the most in the most hazardous manner, it is your women, your young women, 25 and under. And so that then may become your target group. Now, they're fairly low, but I think they're 10th on this chart out of 14. 10th, meaning they're, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are higher. Okay?

2. Causes for Rate of Use Growth The percentage of young people who drink alcohol has steadily increased worldwide in the last two decades. Instant communications Increased advertising Targeted markets Relaxed attitudes Misinformation 

00:31:45
True or False? Cell/Mobile Phones are more common than land based phones People under age 25 are more likely to have a cell phone than older people 

00:31:45
True or False According to the investment online newsletter "The Motley Fool", new developments with iPhone are replacing laptop computers among the young The family television is quickly being replaced by Wi-Fi transmissions of movies, TV. shows, etc. Cable/satellite TV. & computers are "cookied" This provides a venue for targeted marketing 

00:31:45
True or False? European countries have less restrictive drinking age laws and attitudes which, in turn, foster more responsible styles of drinking by young people. 

00:31:45
True or False Parents know where their children are and with whom they associate. Parents know their children drink but think they cannot stop it.

00:31:55
BARRY L. JACKSON Again, this is a chart showing mainly Europe. And, and this is interesting. If you point out, remember, Greece, every knows about the terrible economic problems at Greece. Has it cut down their drinking? Absolutely not. Look at those numbers. Denmark's prosperous, they're drinking. Germany's prosperous, they're drinking. Netherlands is still prosperous, Belgium is prosperous, they're drinking. Ireland is in trouble and look at them. So there doesn't, as you look at this kind of a chart and this kind of data, there really doesn't, it really doesn't follow that there's any coordination or correlation between good times, bad times and alcohol consumption. Again, I can't explain why, I'm just pointing out some things that I've seen in the literature and in the data. Now, causes for, uh, rate of growth. Percent of youth who drink alcohol has steadily increased worldwide in the last two decades, and part of that, I think, is due to instant communications. You know, the Arab Spring that occurred, it was all because of Twitter and Facebook and all these instant communications. Everybody knows what's going on, young people. We may not be doing this as much as they are, but they're doing it. That's their lifeblood. They're doing it every minute. I was at a, um, giving a keynote in, in, in Romania and I was at this, um, banquet dinner afterwards and there were a lot of young people there. I was, spoke to, uh, Romanian air force cadets. And so they were all sitting around, they were having a great time, they were dancing, and nobody was out of hand. I mean, they were reasonable, okay? But I've gotta tell you, every one of them had a cell phone on the table and they were looking at it every time they came back from a dance. And it's like, you guys all have, you know, an addiction to your cell phone. You know? You're gonna wear your little finger out. Um, but that was just the way they are, and it's that way everywhere. I was in Japan recently and I couldn't believe how many people were walking around, some with two phones, one on each ear. I just couldn't believe it. It's just worldwide for this population, for this age group. And so instant communication is one of the things. Increased advertising. It's all over, and a lot of it is on these sites that young people look at. Any sites that are targeted, they are targeting young people because they know young people have discretionary income and are spending it on alcohol. And even if they don't have discretionary income, they're spending their parents' discretionary income on alcohol. And the drinks that they're making for them are things like Captain Morgan, you know, sweet, relatively inexpensive. Cheap and cheerful, I think they call it in New Zealand. RTDs, Ready to Drinks. Uh, and they put them in little four-packs, one is strawberry, one is watermelon, one is lemonade. You know, they don't taste like alcohol, but they have high alcohol content, 14%, 15% in some cases. Some higher. I've seen ones that are at 50%. And then you have these Red Bull and, you know, alcohol drinks. So what we get? A wide-awake drunk who can drink more. And it's all targeted for young people in the way that Joe Camel targeted the tobacco industry for young people. We haven't done anything about it. There's relaxed attitudes worldwide about drinking, and I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that. And then a lot of misinformation. People just don't know what they need to know. And that was the example of the earlier exercise. True or false, cell phones, are there more, uh, than land-based phones? What do you think? Yes, way more. Way more. So that's, that's one of the issues. People under 25 are far more likely to have a cell phone or mobile phone than people our age. Well, at least, my age. I'm way older than any of you. I could be your grandparent. Um, so, uh, instant communication is, is another factor. And with that, some of these cell phones, they have ads. You know, it's right on the cell phone. And you get a discount if you allow certain ads to come in on your accounts in, in some, uh, phone districts. So if you allow the ad to come over your cell phone, you get a discount for the month's fee. And if you buy prepaid in some countries, you're gonna get all these ads right away because they're selling that time to an advertiser who's targeting you, or your child, with specific kinds of information, and that's what brings the cost down so they can sell it cheaper. True or false, according to the investment online newsletter The Motley Fool, new developments with the iPhone are replacing laptop computers among the young. What do you think? It is true. There's predictions that laptops will, within five years, be obsolete, that you can do everything on your cell phone. You won't need a computer. Many of you, and some of them right here, have these little tiny things already. Uh, how many of you use your cell phone now, your iPhone or whatever, for your email? Yeah. More than half of you. I do too except when I'm roaming. Roaming charges are killing me out of the U.S. It's cheaper in New Zealand to buy a little cheap Vodafone and keep changing my chip every, every country I go to. It's cheaper than using my roaming charge from the United States. So that's what I do. Every place I go, I have a little baggie with "Romania," "Malta," you know, "New Zealand," "Australia" written on the outside, and that's what I, I take it out and put that one in. And then I get from Vodafone, "Welcome to New Zealand." "Welcome," it's nice. That way I know where I am. So. Um, true or false, European countries have less restricted age laws and attitudes which in turn foster more responsible styles of drinking by young people. Pick any one. Denmark. Um, the answer is, back in the 80s New Zealand used this philosophy under their prime minister to say, "Look, we can create a culture here in New Zealand. We don't have to close our bars at 6:00 anymore. We can get rid of this two gallon glass of beer that they sell at the last hour." You know, into the 60s, women couldn't go into a public bar at all? And the bars were open from noon to 6:00. And everybody got tanked up at, you know, 5:30, right after work. They went out and they got these great big two-gallon kind of things. They were still using, uh, English measurements then, not meters, or milliliters and all that stuff. And they would have these great big glasses and everybody'd get drunk and go home. You know, good old days. And, uh, you couldn't buy any alcohol on Saturday and, uh, or on Sunday and some place you couldn't buy it on Saturday so you couldn't go to the cricket and get drunk. So people didn't go to the cricket. Um, but, uh, you know, the, the wisdom was, "Look, we can create this wet culture where we can have nice restaurants and dinner and all go and have a nice little glass of wine and be responsible." And so they dropped the drinking age. The only age, you had to be 16 to buy alcohol, but you could drink it at any age. Now you have to be 18 to buy it. But, you know, I'm 18 years old, my girlfriend's 16, I go buy a bunch of alcohol, and we go sit in the public park and drink it. It's legal. And they did away with all the public intoxication laws. The only law they kept was public driving intoxication laws. Everything else they pretty much eliminated. Did they get what they wanted? A dry, or a nice wet sophisticated European culture? No. In fact, that's probably a myth. If you look at France and those data, the French have a low consumption rate overall, high intoxication rate. Which is what you were talking about earlier, the inverse. So, uh, it, it's probably a myth. True or false, parents know where their children are and with whom they associate. Ah-ha. Parents know their children drink, but they think they cannot stop it. Ah. Very interesting. The research that we just completed shows that parents do know what their kids are and do know what their kids are doing and they do not stop it. Absolutely. They know they're sexually active at 14 and 15. And in many cases, they put their daughter on the pill so she won't get pregnant. They give her condoms to take on her date. They let the boy come home with them and stay overnight. I see some smiles. You must be a parent. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Oh, yes, the boyfriend, girlfriend moves into the house with the parent and says, "Hey, guess what? I'm home, home now. Feed me." Uh, um, this study in Malta showed that 80% of parents knew exactly where their kids were and exactly what they were doing. Uh, 25% of the time, the children took alcohol from their parents' home with the parents' knowledge or the parents gave it to them. More of half of all alcohol consumed was purchased illegally. That's true in four or five other countries we looked at as well. Nobody's enforcing the law. It's "Ah, it's just alcohol. It's not drugs. Thank God it's not marijuana. Thank God it's not cocaine or P or, or methamphetamine. Thank God they're not buying that stuff from Korea." You know, Korea's, North Korea's now selling, did you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Their, their, their scientists are literally, to help their bottom line, are literally making, um, methamphetamine and selling it. Very high, pure stuff, so you're gonna see that begin to show up if you're a drug and alcohol counselor. It may show up soon on your shores. Uh, police rarely enforce, uh, rarely enforce the sale. They just, they don't, they look the other way. Now, the myth is that children don't listen to their parents. That is absolutely wrong. The research tells us repeatedly, if you as a parent say, "I don't want you doing this," they think twice. You don't have to make a threat. You don't have say, "I'm going to take your car away." Probably a threat makes them more likely to do it 'cuz they're gonna challenge you. Like, "Yeah right, Dad." You know, "Who's gonna drive me to school? You're gonna drive me? You're gonna get up at 7:00 and drive me to school? No, you're gonna let me use my car." No. What we know from the research is parents who say "I don't want you doing this," their kids are less likely to be participants. Which brings us to the issue of endorsement, which I will talk about. Alcohol-related harm. Let's go through these. Adolescents report very drinking pattern, very different drinking patterns than parents. I've discussed this. Their patterns are very different from culture to culture in terms of what they drink but no so much in terms of how they drink. They drink to get drunk. Adults don't do that, generally speaking. They may get drunk on the way. They may wanna be a little bit high. But teenagers, youths, go out specifically to get intoxicated. And so we have acute alcohol poisoning, long-term diseases, about 60 conditions, unintended sexual behaviors, um, and I know you spell "behaviors" differently. Just consider me an uninformed American who forgot the "u." Uh, sexual assaults, teen pregnancy, STIs or STDs or whatever you call them, the old days when I was growing up it was "venereal disease." Accidents. Not just automobile accidents. In a study we did at the DHB in Wellington 60% of all treated patients, uh, from Friday night to Sunday morning in the emergency room, emergency department, "ED" means something else in the United States, but in the ED, 60% were alcohol related. And they weren't driving events. They were drinking, they stepped off the curb, broke their ankle. They fell down, hit their head on a curb. And that did not include sexual assaults. That was just accidents. So we tend to think of alcohol-related accidents only being automobile, and that is incorrect. Homicide, suicide, and social costs. Social costs, just think of how many students perform poorly at university and get dismissed because of heavy consumption of alcohol. In the United States about one out of two people will ever graduate from undergraduate school, having attended. Only about one out of two. The estimate is anywheres between 10% and 15% of that group would have made it had they not consumed alcohol at high levels. Now if you think about that, 10% or 15% of the half that fail out, that would be 5% to 7.5% of the total population. 14 million students, about 7.5% won't graduate ever because of heavy alcohol use. How much waste in terms of dollars and cents, just, you know, an actuarial thing, the kind our bosses like, you know? "Hey," the government says, "How many, how many dollars is this gonna cost us to give you a prevention program?" Well, if the average cost is $20,000 a year, and I'm sure it's a lot more than that, but if the average cost were $20,000 a year and you have, say, 8% of 14 million, that's, what, uh, 800,000, 900,000 people? How many hundreds of millions? That's 16 million, 17 million a year times four years? And remember, it's one year, first class, second year, it's two, third, it's three, and four. So it goes up exponentially. We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars lost, maybe billions in, in a 10-year period. Not to mention their productivity. 'Cuz now they'll be less productive. Because they don't have that college degree in engineering, they're not gonna be an engineer, they're not gonna make the income, and the tax revenue base is lower. So that's just one example, not to talk about the hospital costs, the social health costs, the pregnancies that are unwanted, the STDs that are unwanted. Um, all of those kinds of things, these are all social costs. 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN In Australia, the social cost of alcohol abuse, uh, I've heard figures up to $4 billion. What's that? 

00:48:15
BARRY L. JACKSON Annually? 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. The, um, just as an indication, the police superintendent in Mount Isa which is in the northwest area of Queensland, he's got 100 police in the northwest area, and I asked him about three years ago, "How many police would you require if it wasn't for alcohol abuse?" And he said, "16." From that area in northwest Queensland, 16. 

00:48:40
True or False Only alcoholics need worry about health issues. People are generally unaware of the connection between health and alcohol use. Approximately 20 health conditions have been linked to alcohol abuse. 

00:48:40
Findings Hazardous youth drinking is A multi-national problem Has enormous negative implications: Health Accidents Suicide Homicide Social 

00:48:45
BARRY L. JACKSON Um, yes. And when I mentioned social costs, I just gave one example of university costs. And then there are occupation costs. Um, I can give you an example from my home university's town, uh, Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania. Uh, it has a longstanding tradition of about 30 years of what started out as a Renaissance fair kind of thing and now it's separated out, but it's Bloomsburg Block Party. You can Google it and you'll find it and you'll find all kinds of terrible things about it. It's gotten at times so violent they had to purchase for the county what's called a "BearCat." It's a personal armored vehicle for the police to break up the riots. I have no clue how much this thing costs. I do know that they broke the windshield in this past spring. The windshield was $20,000. Supposed to be a bulletproof windshield. It, it didn't withstand the, um, cinderblocks from about three stories up. So I don't know if the manufacturer screwed up or if a cinderblock is worse than a bullet, I don't know. Um, but, working very closely with the chief of police over the years in, in that situation, we have found a very small percentage of the students, uh, are involved in the trouble. It's largely non-students who are arrested, not because there's selectivity in arrests but just because the students know that if they're caught, they get thrown out of school. If the local teenage kid joins this group of university students and drinks and gets out of control, they get fined, Mommy and Daddy get upset maybe, and that's about all. Um, so consequences do change things. But what's interesting is that when we talk, when I talk about the college students, remember, there're a lot of non-college student age involved in these things. And we saw this in Duendin with Otago University and their problems that they've had in the past with their toga party and those kind of things. Because I did work with them. And they had some of the same issues. The majority of people arrested were non-students. So it's just not students, it's young people, young people in general. True or false, this got up before we got a chance. They were gonna come up one at a time, but we got talking. Uh, only alcoholics need worry about health issues, what do you think? No. Obviously. Um, it's not just alcoholics who have problems with health issues. Alcoholics may have the most pronounced and acute problems, but any heavy drinker, any drinker over a long period of time beyond what's medically safe, and that, again, is defined, in your country, it's two a day with a day off or something. In New Zealand it's seven a day, uh, with no day off. Um, or with one day off, excuse me. In the United States, it's four for men and three for women in a day, no days off. So, I mean, it varies depending on which medical association and which country you're in and cynically, I would say, uh, how strong your liquor industry is. Um, people are generally unaware of the connection between alcohol and health, and I think that is true. People think it's not a problem. It's not marijuana, it's not cocaine, it's not P, so it's, it's, it's okay, you know? It's not methamphetamine It's all right. "Let's do a little crack." "No, no, no, no, that's bad for you." "Hey, let's drink four bottles of, uh, Jack Daniels." "Oh, that's good." Um, so I think people are generally unaware, and because the health issues progress, are progressive and very slow in many people, unless you're truly an alcoholic, and even then, some of these diseases take a long time to fulminate. So people don't make the connection. Uh, and you already know that there are about 60 health conditions, not 20. Hazardous, hazardous youth drinking is a multi-national problem. It has enormous negative implications for health, accidents, suicide, homicide, and social issues. Um, and let me just mention for a moment suicide. Depending on which study you look at, again, suicide may contribute to at least half or more of all suicides or suicide attempts. Now it depends on which study you look at, and there's an estimate that between one out of 10 and one out of 20, um, suicides are completed. So if one out of, say, 15, if you take the middle number, one out of 15 are completed, that means there are 15 times as many people attempting as completing. How much of that is alcohol-related? So suicide alone is an enormous cost. Suicide attempts are an enormous cost to our population. And depression. Alcohol, as we know, contributes to depression, and people who are depressed drink more, in many cases. And people who are depressed are more likely to commit suicide. So there's an interconnection of these kinds of things that we, we really need to think about. And I, I know from my own, uh, history, I spent 44 years in this profession, and the last 20 really specializing in alcohol, um, principally because my university president said, "You're going to." And that's how I got into it. But, you know, as a psychologist, uh, board-certified nationally and, and counselor board-certified nationally, you know, I saw lots of clients, 20 or 30 a week, minimum, uh, for I don't know how many years, 20-some. Um, we didn't focus on, on their alcohol, and I think that that was typical. I didn't have a single drug and alcohol course in graduate school, and I went to a reputable school. I went to Syracuse University, I went to University of Georgia. Reputable schools. They didn't teach that. They taught psychodynamics, Harry Stack Sullivan, Freud. Um, Carl Rogers was a newbie then. He was coming into the thing and, uh, you know, so we learned that. And the warm, touchy-feely group stuff of, you know, Gyan and Folds. Oh, we all have to be in groups and hug each other. Um, I see some of you smiling. You can relate to those days. Um, I, I see from some of my colleagues that some of those things are coming back. I don't know. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Um, I thought we'd sort of gone beyond them, beyond that, but I'm not sure. Maybe, maybe there's something really good there. I don't mean to offend anyone. Um, but that's, you know, life has changed. We didn't get taught about alcohol and drugs. And until relatively recently in most of the countries, certainly in Pennsylvania, um, 15 to 20 years ago, the majority of people providing g services were themselves in recovery. They had no specialized training, they were former drug addicts, former alcoholics, they had no specialized training, and they were providing the counseling to other drug and alcohol people. That's the lay of the land. Um. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN I did my training in New Zealand, and even those tutor who were training us, their history, they were those people before. And when I moved into working with mental health, most of my coworkers had issues before related to drinking alcohol, and they were working in that field. And seems to be working really well, so. 

00:56:25
Findings Countries that have liberal drinking laws and social norms - So called moderate drinking "wet culture" is not the norm among adolescents and young adults in many parts of the world International responses are warranted

Alcohol Related Harm in the European Union Alcohol-attributable disease, injury and violence across the EU costs E125 billion a year. More than 25% of young adult deaths in men are alcohol-related 10,000 suicides (1 in 6) are alcohol related 40% of all murders are alcohol related In Finland, 45% of all violent incidents reported by 12-18 year olds involved drinking on the part of the perpetrator and/or victim. 

00:56:25
Alcohol Related Harm in Other Nations In the USA 70% of suicides, 500,000 university students injured and 1400 to 1800 university students die annually due to alcohol related incidents. In New Zealand 37% of all murders and up to 70% of weekend injuries are due to alcohol. In the Philippines, 14% of 15-24 year olds reported physical hurting someone through violence in the pervious three months, such violence was significantly associated with drinking. Among 10-18 year olds, participating in the Caribbean Youth Health Survey, having used alcohol in the last year was significantly associated with weapon-related violence for both males and females.

BARRY L. JACKSON I'm not critical of it. Um, I think there is some real value in it. The issue is, how much do they know about what's really going on physiologically, how much do they know about the neurology of this? Um, the speech this morning was very illuminating about neurobiology. There's an enormous amount that we've learned about alcohol and drug impact on the brain and its function and its growth and its destruction of, of neural tissue. And yet, when I sat with my colleagues when I first went into this field, I decided, well, I'm not an expert, I better go learn something. So I went to the mandated state programs, and the people teaching the, uh, were in many cases not even high school graduates. And they were teaching me things, and I learned later were totally wrong, totally wrong, about drug interactions. What they were good at was helping other people get through withdrawal and recovery in terms of the everyday behavioral kinds of things. But what they didn't know was why. And so the field's change. The field has changed dramatically in this regard, I think for the better. I do think some things are lost. Most of the people I now work with have never had an alcohol or drug problem. And so those who have it say, "Well, you can't relate to me because you don't know." And I always think to myself, "Hmn, I've never had a broken leg, but I don't need one to know it's painful." So, so, uh, you know, there's pros and cons. Uh, what we do find is that this so-called wet culture, I mentioned before, is, is not the norm among adolescents. It just isn't. Even in those countries that have a fairly reasonable culture like France likes to portray itself as a reasonable, you know, nice cuisine, nice, uh, glass of wine culture, even those cultures we see a huge issue with young people. Holland says they have no drinking problem. Ah, yeah, the largest drug country in the world for legal drugs. They're making changes, too, by the way. Um, if you're not aware of it, you can no longer go there on this unabashed drug holiday and just get anything you want. Um, Amsterdam has put some new regulations in place that limit outsiders coming in and using. If you're a resident, you can use all kinds of things, but if you're a tourist, you may be restricted from using some of those same things. So there's some wall changes. I'm not totally familiar with all that so I can't quote it for you. Um, I think international responses are warranted. The World Health Organization agrees. They, they, or I agree with them. I guess they're a bigger organization, better known, than me, so I guess I agree with them. We are really not addressing this issue in any kind of preventive way. We're not funding it. Uh, Phillip said this morning in him, um, little pre-conference talk, uh, introduction of our speaker this morning, uh, that prevention is ignored. That is my experience as well. Pennsylvania has done a little bit better job than most of the other states in the United States, and it gives 15% of its D&A budget to prevention efforts, efforts specifically. But that's unusual, and even 10% or 15% is a drop in a bucket. Um, another country I worked with has a heroin problem, and it is, admittedly, it's a big problem. However, they spend 93% of their national budget for drug and alcohol on heroin for 600 people. That's what they do. Everyone else is pretty much ignored. There's no prevention efforts at all. And ironically, when those people who are in prison with a drug and alcohol problem get out, they have no aftercare, no follow-up, and while they're in prison, they have no prevention, education regarding alcohol and drugs. That's the worst case situation I've seen. But most countries, and I take it that New Zealand is, uh, or Australia is in the same position, really don't do much in the way of prevention. It's not that you don't try, it's not recognized and funded in the same way that intervention is, after someone has a problem. Am I correct? Yeah, I thought so. Uh, so which is reality? This or this? I think it's pretty clear, that's the reality that we see. Uh, it's, it's not that nice, refined drinking. That is not what you see. Alcohol, alcohol-related harm, uh, in Europe, European Union, you can just get some of these number. And this is 2010 euros. Uh, so three years ago. E125 billion a year in alcohol-attributable disease, injury, and violence. That is not automobile injuries, by the way. 25% of young adult deaths in men are alcohol related. 10,000 suicides, one in six, are alcohol related. That's what's acknowledged. Now, keep in mind some of the Catholic nations are very reluctant to report a death as a suicide because they cannot be buried in consecrated ground if it's a suicide. I've encountered that before in working in Pennsylvania with priests. Some priests are pretty open-minded and say, "Well, mental illness is an illness, so we're just say they were ill, and that's okay." Um, so they died of the illness. Um, but technically speaking, in Italy, if you commit suicide, it's not gonna be, um, reported because, probably, because they want your body buried in consecrated ground. So you see a lot of underreporting in some of these countries. But you get the notion here. Uh, 40% of all domestic violence is related to alcohol. 40% of murders related to alcohol. Finland, 45% of violent incidents reported by 12 to 18 year olds. In Malta and other countries people under age 12 cannot even be accused of a crime. It's called dolci incapaci, meaning because of age, they're incapable of committing a crime. So sweet innocence, it's called. They, they're incapable. Same in Australia? So you can't inform intent, then you can't be charged, yeah. Yeah. Um. Yeah, it is common in some places. In other places, the United States, you may be charged with a crime, but you won't be convicted, you'll be convicted, but you won't get the penalty of an adult. So it gets counted as, as a crime. In many cultures, they don't even count it. They just send the kid home. Um, so you have no clue when you start talking about juvenile delinquency, and I've done some cooperative research with other people and, and some countries, there's no comparison because you can't make it under 12. And in some cultures, it's under 14. And then from 14 to 18, they have discretionary justice where the judge decides whether or not it's, um, whether or not they, they had intent or whatever. So it's very difficult, again, when you're talking about international standards and international data, as I pointed out in the very beginning. Alcohol-related harm in other nations, again, suicide in the U.S. about 70%. 500,000 students a year injured at universities. Uh, between 1,400 and 1,800 students die annually related to alcohol. And it's a huge, huge secret. Everybody keeps it quiet because no university wants to admit that their student died. I got my job initially, uh, to be, uh, change from the director of the university's counselor center to create a, a brand new program in alcohol and, uh, drug addictions because we had seven deaths in nine months at my university. My president was brand new, she was absolutely inundated with complaints by the board of trustees, she had to do something, she tapped me on the shoulder and said, "You're gonna do this." And I said, "But I'm not an expert," and she said, "You're gonna become one because we have a problem." And so we did. We dealt with it. Um, but universities, by and large, don't want to admit it. And that, by the way, are only the deaths, the 1,400 to 1,800 are only the deaths committed while the student is at the university. If they go home on Spring Break, they don't get counted because they're in some other jurisdiction. If they're home for summer session, they don't get counted. So we're talking only about those students who for the 36 weeks they're on the campus, commit suicide or get injured. In New Zealand, 37% of all murders, 70% of weekend injuries up that amount. Philippians, again, 14% of, of 15 to 24 year olds. So you can see the pattern all over the world is very much the same. Some harm-reduction methods. I'm gonna go through these quickly and then what I wanna do is take the last, I think we have about 15 minutes, to just go through some of these and talk about what things can be done and what we know from the literature, uh, works. And I am checking my time. Yeah, we have for time for this, and that's what I was hoping for, because that'll be the part where you can, you know, contribute. I know I've thrown a lot of data at you, a lot of information. I hope it's at least enlightening and that you can take this and maybe use it for your own purposes to convince your local politicians, your local government, your funding agencies, that something really needs to be addressed. And then you should take local data and work it into these same kind of, uh, formats to see what you have. Well, what are some of the things you can do? Screening. I'm just gonna go through these real quickly. Screening. Um, every physician, every counselor should be screening immediately upon the first sight of this client or patient for alcohol and drug issues, for addictions in general, but alcohol specifically. It is the bigger issue. Alcohol is the approved drug of our societies, and so people don't see anything wrong with it. We know that you shouldn't smoke marijuana, well, now in 10 states in the United States you can. Um, but, you know, we know it's not good for you and we know it's a drug and we, we talk about it being a gateway drug and all those kind of things. Lots of people know that. But we don't talk about alcohol like that. And what we do know is that alcohol and tobacco precede in usage other drug use. People are using alcohol and smoking tobacco before they get into other drugs. And we don't talk about alcohol as a gateway drug, do we? Anybody ever heard it called a gateway drug? Just one. Generally speaking, that is not the perception. Brief counseling and invention. Um, there are pros and cons to this, as we know. Uh, again, this morning when we talked about neurobiology, brief counseling may change some behaviors, may not for others because there isn't sufficient time to change the neuro processes involved in thought. 

01:08:40

01:09:05
BARRY L. JACKSON Yes. Brief interventions is a difficult one to say, again, because it's defined in very different ways. Um, you know, the training that we do with physicians in New Zealand is a 10- to 12-minute brief intervention to identify. It's not to, uh, uh, you know, it's not an intervention, it's to identify for referral purposes. So you identify who is having a problem and then you refer them elsewhere where they can get proper treatment. And that's really an essential, it's a piece of screening, very honestly. Um, substance abuse education, intervention and prevention. Again, prevention is a hard one to prove to politicians because what are you saying? I stopped this from happening? It's sort of like terrorism. We put $200 billion into anti-terrorism and we haven't had any terror attacks, so therefore it works. Um, hmn. Can we really prove that? How many attempts were there that we stopped? We don't really know some of these things. Now, with terrorism, maybe we have a better idea because the governments sort of catch people, but they don't tell us about it 'cuz they don't wanna give it away or whatever. But how do you prove that you stopped something from happening? You know, in research statistics, you can't prove that, the negative. You can only prove that it happened once. Right? So we know it happened once in a thousand times, but we can't prove that it didn't happen more than that. We can't say, "Oh, it never happens," 'cuz then if it happens just once in a hundred million times, well, we're wrong. So prevention is a difficult thing in terms of demonstrating that it's working. Now, there are some ways of doing that. You can take cohort studies and say, "In this group that we intervened with, this happened. In this group we didn't intervene with, this happened," and make comparisons. We don't get enough money to do prevention work, let alone do research on prevention work. So I don't see it very often. My work at the university was largely, I would say 80% prevention, 20% intervention treatment. And I went that way from the very beginning. When my president said, "You gotta do something," I said, "Well, we've gotta get our numbers down," from nothing other than public relations, which she bought because she was concerned about her image. And we've gotta sell the university and we can't have all these young kids dying all over the campus. Parents won't send them to us, uh, they won't entrust their child to us. So we have to find something. So we got all these prevention programs going, and they work. They do work. If you look at the cohorts. Um, after I took over, in the next 14 years we had one suicide. Now, were all the other seven deaths related to alcohol? Those seven I talked about specifically were. Were there other suicide attempts? Maybe, maybe not. This one suicide definitely was, it was a drug overdose, she jumped out a window. Um, but those things will happen when you have a population of 10,000. Somebody will die. You know, it sounds unfeeling. It's not. It's a reality. Community service, alternative activities. I skipped that. Alternative activities. Providing people with something other to do than just get drunk. One of the great sadnesses I see and I saw with my children growing up was that when I grew up, we all looked forward to the prom, junior prom. You know, next year you were gonna graduate, you know? We got to go to the prom for the first time, we got dressed up, and we had little boutonnieres and we thought we were just cool, you know? We were, great thing, you know, when you bought a girl a corsage and, you know, she put it on her wrist or if you were lucky, she put it on her dress and you got to pin it on, you know? Real, real hot stuff. Now they have these kind of dances in the fifth grade. Oh, I'm graduating from the forth grade to the fifth grade, so we have a graduation ceremony. What we have done is take the specialness out of almost everything at a very young age. I see that as a huge problem, looking back over things. I see university students go to parties and they don't know how to dance and have a good time without being drunk. They just don't. They don't know how to relate to others unless they're, you know, stoned out of their minds. As Americans call it, shit-faced. You know? "Unless I'm really messed up, I don't know how to talk to a girl. And then I talk to her in the crudest of manners because it's okay 'cuz I'm drunk. Hey, yeah, I don't mean anything. I didn't mean to offend you, I'm drunk." You know? And everything's okay. So I, I think we have got to find other things to which they relate that is an alternative to just getting drunk. And you would be amazed at many students at universities stay home because they don't wanna go to the party and get drunk. They don't really want, they're not into it. They might wanna have a drink, but they don't wanna go and get drunk and get vomited on and, and, you know, get hit on by drunk guys and, and all this kind of stuff. They don't wanna be around that. They're not the ones you hear about. It's the ones who cause the problems you hear about, obviously. We have to find alternative activities that they find interesting, not that you and I find interesting. You know, giving them a prom, who cares? Community service. One of the things we did in our prevention program, every student who was, um, caught and convicted of a crime, an alcohol-related crime, on or off campus, were required to go through my program at the university. And one of those components was community service. Judges would give them anywheres from 20 to 200 hours of service. If they failed to do that, they would go to jail. That's their alternative, that's the motivator. And I've gotta tell you, there's a lot of controversy in the field, and when I first started out in counseling and psychology, they said, you know, "A client forced to be in there is not a good client. You shouldn't take them. You should never take mandated referrals." I disagree after 44 years of experience. My experience is it doesn't matter how you got them there, it's what you do when you get them there, and that, to me, was the issue. And so we had a recidivism rate of less than 1.2% over 15 years of the program. The normal recidivism rate is about 6% to 6.5% in the larger population. The program with prevention worked, and part of that was community service. And community service wasn't go rake leaves for some old lady down the street. It was to do something related to their offense. We put them through training and then sent them into the elementary school system, with a supervisor, to provide programming to other young kids, those kind of programs. So we did a lot of those kind of things, and I can talk individually with people at another time. Uh, community awareness and values education. We did a lot of that with all the students. Every single freshman student at our university had to go through a program the first week on campus. And we got them the first day because by the second day, they were already out drinking. The aim wasn't to stop them from drinking, it was to get them to drink less and be more responsible, because the reality is, yes, they're underage, they're breaking the law, the reality is, if I say, "Don't drink," the conversation's over. If I say, "Look, I know you're gonna drink. Here are some things you need to know, 'cuz you don't know. And here are some of the problems you can get into." If you're convicted in Pennsylvania and in most states of the United States of an alcohol- or drug-related offense, you will never be a licensed professional in any profession. It's over. You won't be a schoolteacher, a lawyer, a doctor, a dentist, an engineer, psychologist, counselor. It's gone, folks. Why are people going to university? To be a professional. We lay that down hard and we lay it down on the parents too. We do parental education. Mom and Dad, and we tell them, "Look, you better talk to your son and daughter because this is the consequence. You're gonna spend $100,000 sending your kid off to university and at the end of that four years, they can't do anything except flip burgers at McDonalds. Think about that." And you know, parents put pressure on them. Remember I said earlier, students do listen. People, young people do listen to their parents. We absolutely know that. It's true. It's just parents don't believe it and so parents don't say it. They think they're gonna alienate their kid. Their kid, "Oh, he'll never talk to me again!" My son always said, "Dad, I hate the fact that you do this for a living." And I said, "Why?" He said, 'cuz he went to university, I wouldn't let him go where I was teaching, he had to go elsewhere, and my daughter too. She wasn't a problem. He was potentially a problem. And, uh, he said, "Because I can't get away with anything. You know exactly what's going on." And I'm sure he still got away with things, but he had the perception that I knew it was going on, so he didn't misbehave as often as he probably would've otherwise. Governmental regulations. Putting that simple mark on a glass is a governmental regulation. It makes a difference. So there's some examples. What I'd like to do now, uh, for the last 10 minutes or so is open it up, and I'll hand the mike to you folks and you can kind of pass it around and, you know, share with others some of the things that you're doing or like to see done or think would be helpful or ask, ask me questions. Who'd like to start? Very good. Now remember, you are on camera and being recorded. 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Well, this, there's a place, I think, in Australia, it's called jurisdiction we're in. It's, um, declared a dry jurisdiction. Maybe that's another, I'm just thinking of that, you know, that maybe there are jurisdictions that can be declared dry. Because there's a place in Australia wherein you can't bring anything alcoholic in that area. For the indigenous, yeah, indigenous sort of areas. Yeah. So everything has to be declared or you're not, everything's confiscated if you bring something inside. So that's, that's sort of one area that I had in mind. The other one is the suppliers' responsibility, is that it seems that everything is just on the, the consumers' responsibility, and I think that we need to increase the suppliers' responsibility. You know, that they have a responsibility not to serve anyone who's already intoxicated. That sort of thing. 

01:20:05
BARRY L. JACKSON Let me, let me, am I on? Yeah. Let me comment about that. Um, again, many states in the United States, and Pennsylvania being one of them, Pennsylvania I mention because I've been there, but also Pennsylvania has been recognized as one of the five, uh, leading states in the United States in terms of dealing with these issues. Um, Pennsylvania has made very strict penalties for retail. Um, retail salers would be, um, salers would be restaurants, bars, those kind of places. Uh, retail sellers have a very large responsibility. There's a program called VIP, Visibly Intoxicated Person. If, um, a bartender serves to a visibly intoxicated person, they can be fined, and the establishment be fined. So if you're the waitress and you serve a visibly intoxicated person, you can be fined $1,000. The, uh, restaurant can be fined $15,000 and closed for 15 business days. You lose your license for 15 business days, you're gonna be out of business. So, um, there's enormous amount of, um, protection of one's license, uh, to serve these things. And we do license all establishments. Um, we also limit sales so that sales, um, are limited in, in regions like you're talking about. And you can only buy bulk alcohol at specifically identified places. Um, and then if you're buying over a certain amount, it's registered. So 

01:21:45
UNKNOWN There're, there're also countries that, um, they don't sell alcohol on a Sunday, or? 

01:21:50
BARRY L. JACKSON Yes, the United States, many states like Pennsylvania, has no Sunday sales, no sales on, on voting days, either. 

01:21:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:21:55
BARRY L. JACKSON Uh, old history of that. We don't want, we actually, a lot of the voting happened in local taverns, so they'd shut the drinking down while they voted. After the voting, everybody'd drink again. But, uh, yes, there are those kind of rules. Yes. Let, let's make sure we pass the, uh, microphone around. 

01:22:15
UNKNOWN Not three countries only which have got Sunday-free selling of alcohol. Even WN (inaudible ), no alcohol on a Sunday. And we've got also surrounding communities like (inaudible ), they're dry communities. You're not allowed to bring alcohol into those communities. And even in the town, which is (inaudible ), there're restricted hours to sell alcohol. And it seems to be working really well. And to add on that, it's a form of our harm reduction sort of activity, it's our sub-earning center. I go there and other service providers go there on a Wednesday once a week just to provide alternative activities for the people and we conclude with a healthy feeding and we also give them takeaways. These mostly are homeless people, so we give them a feed to take away with them and just to provide information about what services are around so that they can be helped and to report, because there are other people who take advantage. They buy alcohol on a Saturday and go to the back and sell to those people. So now they know just to record the license number, then you report to the police. And it seems to be working really well. 

01:23:30
BARRY L. JACKSON Um, that's interesting. One of the, um, things that we have in many of the states, and again, Pennsylvania has this, if you as an adult, a legal purchaser of alcohol, provide it to other people, um, free of charge, that's fine, as long as that person's 21 years old or older. If you take it, buy it, and, and take it and give it to somebody else and charge them for it, now you're selling alcohol without a license, and that's a violation of law. And that really comes out of tax, you know, prohibitions. They wanna collect the tax on sales. But if you provide it to a child, even your own child, you're in violation of law. And so one of the most common, uh, problems that we see in a number of states is where Mom and Dad are gonna have a graduation party for their kid and they invite, you know, the student's, closest 3,000 friends, and everybody gets on Twitter and says, "Oh, we get to go to this party," and they all bring alcohol. If the parent allows it or provides it, it's considered furnishing alcohol. The fine is very, very large. It's $1,000 for the first person, $1,500 for every additional person. Jail time, and we've had situations where parents provided these, uh, parties or the venue for the party, had so many people at them, they couldn't pay the fine and the state took their homes. They took their retirement accounts. It is very, very strictly enforced. And what we know about this is that where it's strictly enforced, these kind of things decrease. Parents say, "Whoa, wait a minute. I didn't know I could be fined up to, you know, half a million dollars for having a little old party. Um, and I did all the right things. I took all their keys away and I made them stay overnight. You know, I wouldn't let anybody leave. Nobody's gonna go out and get drunk and, and, you know, kill somebody driving." And they think they've done their, their due, uh, duty. What Pennsylvania has done is put an enormous amount of, uh, money into saying, "Look, here was what the law is. Here's what you have at risk." And that doesn't even include tort liability. Tort liability, meaning some parent says, "My kid, I didn't know my kid was over at your house drinking, and my kid got hurt. I'm suing you." So we have civil lawsuits. So, um, there are government regulations that can be used quite effectively, but only if it's widely advertised and only if, this is the other aspect, if people see it as acceptable. One of the things that we've done in Pennsylvania, and I, I disagree with, because it's not generally accepted, if an underage person is caught drinking, they lose their driving license, even though they weren't driving. So a lot of students say, "Hey, you know, I may as well, uh, drink, get in my car, and drive back from the party, because if I walk back, I'm more likely to get caught and I'll lose my license anyway." So I don't have the answer to that, but I don't think taking their license away for underage drinking is really effective. You had a question as well. We're coming. 

01:26:45
UNKNOWN Um, I think the, the biggest problem that we have here in Australia is that alcohol consumption is part of the culture. We've made it part of the culture. And the only thing, the only real harm reduction method that is going to work long term is going to be, uh, changing that culture. And we've seen, as you pointed out from the statistics, we've seen that, um, the culture has changed, actually, in Australia in the wrong direction. It's, uh, particularly with young women. It's become fashionable and it's become a very, uh, uh, fashionable, I suppose, for young women to go out in groups, clubbing and going to pubs and all the rest of that and binge drinking. It's become fashionable and very acceptable and everybody thinks it's just very sophisticated and all the rest of it. When in actual fact, it wasn't too many years ago, when I was a kid, for instance, um, public drunkenness and public consumption of alcohol in excess was disreputable behavior. You, um, if you did that, you were sort of frowned on and looked on as just a, a common drunk. But these days, everybody can, apparently, engage in public drunkenness and, uh, social behavior and all the rest that goes along with it, um, with no condemnation. It's just, with impunity, effectively. 

01:28:15
BARRY L. JACKSON We need to wrap this up. Let me make a quick comment about that. And it has to do with what I talked, said I would talk about earlier, and that is endorsement. Excuse me. Endorsement is the concept that whether we intentionally or unintentionally approve of something. Parents who let their teenage daughter bring her boyfriend home and stay overnight in the same bed endorse sexual behavior, whether they come out and say, "Yeah, it's fine that you go have sex," or not. Parents who, uh, immediately put their daughter on birth control at age 12 or 14 endorse sexual behavior. And this is what we've found. Um, and that endorsement says, essentially, it's okay to do this. Parents who don't say, you know, the kid steals a little drink of beer at the table and you all see it and you kind of laugh and, "Oh, isn't that cute?" That's endorsement. We're familiar with the intentional endorsement, you know, the, um, sports arenas that all are celebrated by or sponsored by one or another, um, of a dozen different alcohol industry kind of providers. That's endorsement. I'm sorry? Yes. The comment is, uh, political parties also get funding from these liquor agencies. It's the sort of lobbying that goes on. These kinds of things are endorsements. Again, we see this in all behavior, whether it's sexual, alcohol, uh, gun violence, other violence, bullying. If you put your foot down and say, "You cannot behave that way. I don't like it," it makes a difference. We know this. Parents need to be educated to this. Parents are so afraid today in many cultures of alienating their child, of their child saying, "I have human rights!" that what we've lost is the courage to be parents. So my son's comment that he hated the fact that I knew what was going on was clear to me that I was not endorsing behavior, that I was simply saying, "Look, I don't like it. You're not gonna do it. If I find out," and I didn't say things like "if I find out about it," no, because that implies "just don't let me know about it." "If I catch you." That implies that, you know, be sneaky, don't get caught. What you have to say is, "I don't like it. Don't do it." I know that sounds simple and it sounds like too simple to be true. The research does support that. I wanna thank you for your time. We are out of time. Uh, I'll be happy to talk with people later at the conference. I have another work session in about a half an hour, so I need to, um, not, not speak with you now. There are materials on the table. Feel free to take them. If you wanna contact me, my email is on my card. It's also on my biography there. Uh, please feel free. I'll be happy to come back and, and speak to you. Thank you very much.
