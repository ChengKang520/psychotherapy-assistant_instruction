00:00:55
DR. WINNING KING Hi, I’m Doctor Winnie King and I’m coming to you from the lobby of the children’s hospital at Montefiore in New York City. So, don’t be surprised if you hear some noise or ambulances in the background from time to time. Are you scared that when the baby finally comes you might drop or break her? Well, do you worry about how your relationship with your wife might change because your baby is sitting right smack in the middle. Well, our guest today have all the answers. Two of them teach a program called boot camp for new dads at Bristol Hospital in Connecticut, which puts first time dads through baby basic training. Now, I would like to welcome boot camp drool sergeants Pat Nelligan and Pat… Dave Rackliffe and first time dad Fernando Gomez and his daughter Ariana(ph) welcome to the show. She’s so pretty. What a cutie pie? Now, let’s talk with you Dave , you know you’ve coached hundreds of dads. What would you say are the biggest concerns that new dads have? 

00:01:50
DAVE RACKLIFFE Drool Sergeant Boot Camp for New Dads I think the biggest concerns are the handling of the baby from burping, feeding, changing the diapers, holding them, umm… holding them safely, so that they… they feel as though they are secure in their arms… 

00:02:00
DR. WINNING KING Sure. 

00:02:00
DAVE RACKLIFFE …and being along with the baby is something… 

00:02:05
WINNIE KING Oh, that’s right. Because like you’re not gonna leave me with (inaudible ) 

00:02:08
DAVE RACKLIFFE Right, right. 

00:02:08
WINNIE KING …person are you and they… that these, so there’s a soft and pliable and something might happen. What about money, that’s also are the concerns to this, right? 

00:02:15
DAVE RACKLIFFE Finances are a major issue that they really don’t realize uh… until they really begin to experience all the costs that are associated with raising a baby. 

00:02:25
WINNIE KING Once the baby comes out, those knowledge side starts going up and up and up. Fernando was that a concern for you when you were expecting your first child? 

00:02:30
FERNANDO GOMEZ First Time Dad Well, I think as all new fathers you kind of think about well, you know I’m gonna be a dad and what kind of tougher job do I hold umm… (inaudible ) my main concern was her health where she gonna come out with ten toes, ten fingers. 

00:02:41
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, yeah. Pat, what can dads do to feel more comfortable where some of the more basic things like changing the diaper or feeding the baby and burping the baby? 

00:02:50
PAT NELLIGAN Drool Sergeant Boot Camp for New Dads Well, the first thing is find a friend or relative that’s had a new child and dive in because you need the hands on experience, secondly take the course like we teach and third (inaudible ) options are available find yourself a… a doll. 

00:03:05
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, well, the dolls are good, especially in a case like this. What kinds of things should dads be practicing? 

00:03:10
PAT NELLINGAN Well, as Fernando was showing we can burp and we can umm… cuddle and change diapers, but one of the major things is… is handling the baby. 

00:03:20
DR. WINNIE KING Okay. And you’re gonna show us that, right? 

00:03:20
PAT NELLIGAN I would like to. 

00:03:20
DR. WINNIE KING Okay. Let’s… let’s see what we can to do. 

00:03:20
PAT NELLIGAN Sure. 

00:03:25
PAT NELLIGAN What we’re doing is we’d like to get knee to knee. Come close Dave. 

00:03:25
DR. WINNIE KING Okay. 

00:03:30
PAT NELLIGAN Because, obviously with gravity and height babies can fall and we wouldn’t like the baby to obviously get hurt. So we get as close as we can and I would hold the baby’s neck, hold the buttocks and I’m gonna hand it over to Dave and I would not let go until he tells me he has it. 

00:03:45
DAVE RACKLIFFE I have her. Once I’ve got her, I’ll get her comfortable in my arms and then if I’m going to pass the baby back to Pat, I’ll arrange her so that I’ve got control of her head and her neck and I’ve got control of her buttocks and I’ll pass back to Pat and not let go until he tells me. 

00:04:00
PAT NELLIGAN I’ve got her. 

00:04:00
DR. WINNIE KING Alright. Just good communication and recognizing those are the body parts that they need to be stable as you… 

00:04:05
PAT NELLIGAN Absolutely. 

00:04:05
DR. WINNIE KING …as you move back and forth. Well, great job. Thank you. We’re going to move on to Fernando who’s going to do something that’s a big part of taking care of a new baby and that’s feeding the baby. So, why don’t you go ahead and let’s start feeding Ariana(ph) and umm… Dave you’re going to ah… give us some pointers about this as he… as he does it. 

00:04:25
DAVE RACKLIFFE Well, first thing you wanna be sure is that the baby is getting (inaudible ) and not air. Umm… so get the bottle upside down as quickly as possible so that she starts to take food in right away. Umm… if she starts to cry right away, she may not be getting any formula and you should check the nipple to make sure there is actually a whole in there. 

00:04:45
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:04:45
DAVE RACKLIFFE There are several ways to do that umm… one would be to disinfect the needle or sterilize a needle with an alcohol swab and then poke the… put a hole in it, if that’s… that’s what the problem is. 

00:04:55
DR. WINNIE KING Well, you know mom’s can easily bond with babies because of the breast feeding, you know that’s a natural way for mother’s to bond with their babies. What about dads? How can they bond with babies when it comes to feeding? 

00:05:05
DAVE RACKLIFFE Well, if the mom is breast feeding, we recommend that the dad’s actually get the baby, pair the baby prior to brining the baby to mom and they’ll do things like change the baby, get them cleaned up if they’ve had any problems during the night and bring the baby to mom, and then participate by just sitting there and watching it. It’s… 

00:05:25
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:05:25
DAVE RACKLIFFE It’s an incredible experience for a dad to watch this… this umm… this. 

00:05:30
DR. WINNIE KING Right. Well, I’m so glad you say that because a lot of guys think oh okay, it’s time for the feeding, I’ll go watch the football game while you go ahead and do the feeding because that your thing with the baby and that’s not true, they do need to be a part of that. 

00:05:40
DAVE RACKLIFFE That’s correct. We… we tell them do not roll over. 

00:05:40
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. Good. 

00:05:40
DAVE RACKLIFFE And go to sleep. 

00:05:40
DR. WINNIE KING Good. Now, Fernando, you’re looking like a pro here with Ariana(ph), how did you learn to do these things? 

00:05:50
FERNANDO GOMEZ Umm… well, at first for the first three weeks after my wife gave birth, I stayed with my in-laws and watching mom and watching how my wife handled the baby and watched the pros do it kind of then took the initiative to go forth and hold the baby, feed the baby. Kind of just step back, watch them first, observe the signs that she gives mom or grandma and work from there. 

00:06:10
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, did you ever feel at times like you won’t do it right? 

00:06:10
FERNANDO GOMEZ At times, there was always eyes over me. 

00:06:15
DR. WINNIE KING Oh, yes. 

00:06:15
FERNANDO GOMEZ If it wasn’t… If wasn’t mom, it was grandma, so sure, that was a concern that I had sometimes in the back of my head would be you know hold the baby right, you’re… you’re letting air go into the bottle and stuff like that was always in the back of head. So, I would make sure I was doing everything right. 

00:06:30
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. You know, Pat men tend to be very insecure about this kind of thing and why… why would you say that their… its one of the problem for them and say women? 

00:06:35
PAT NELLIGAN Well, it just seems as though in the past men weren’t to traditional care givers. So because of that, there is a lot of insecurity, we tend to think black and white anyway, so we either gonna do it better or we’re gonna do it good. And zero tolerance puts a lot of pressure on ourself. 

00:06:50
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, yeah. Well, Fernando when a baby comes in the… the home everything changes, including the relationship that you have with your wife. How did having Ariana(ph) coming to your life changed your relationship? 

00:07:00
FERNANDO GOMEZ Umm… it was something I wasn’t expecting. I knew my life was gonna change with the baby as in schedule and times I went to sleep, times I woke up, but the relationship with my wife changed tramas… drastically due to we both work full time jobs, we come home do choirs and stuff with the baby. We really don’t have time for ourselves until we go to sleep and we end up just falling asleep. 

00:07:25
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, it is exhausted, you know at the end of the day babies do that to you. I… we’ve just got a few moments left, but I want to give each of you an opportunity to share with our viewers what you’ve learned from your experiences as a dad and as a teacher of new dads, what do you want our audience to know and why don’t we start with you Pat? 

00:07:40
PAT NELLIGAN Sure. What we found after teaching hundreds of dads as you said is it boils down to one major component and that’s communication. Communication just into woven throughout all of the things we brought up here and your family. 

00:07:55
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:07:55
PAT NEELIGAN You have to communicate. 

00:07:55
DR. WINNIE KING Communication is always good. 

00:07:55
PAT NELLIGAN Yes. 

00:07:55
DR. WINNIE KING Dave, how about you? 

00:08:00
DAVE RACKLIFFE Well, we… we feel that umm… your life should not change dramatically with the addition of the baby, you shouldn’t… there are things that you were doing before you were parents that you should not stop doing just because you have a baby. You should still be able to enjoy life. 

00:08:15
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:08:15
DAVE RACKLIFFE The baby should not be an obstacle to that. 

00:08:15
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. Very good and just 10 seconds, what would you want new dads to know? 

00:08:20
FERNANDO GOMEZ Set assign sometime during the week, specifically you sit down with your wife, talk to her, let her know how her week went. Sometimes, day in and day out going is sometimes which has house work, fine and that’s it.
