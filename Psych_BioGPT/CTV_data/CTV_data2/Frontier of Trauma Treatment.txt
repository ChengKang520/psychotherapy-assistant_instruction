UNKNOWN Hello, I'd like to welcome you to this wonderful lecture today on the frontiers of trauma treatment with Bessel van der Kolk. We're really fortunate to have him here today because he is a pioneer in this area. He was a participant in one of the first neuroimaging studies of PTSD. And he has continued to evolve this understanding of how intimately linked the mind, brain, system are in the treatment of trauma. Uhm, his work, his innovative methods are amazing, we now can expand our practices, what we do, bringing yoga, theater, all these different modalities into our work. And he has an esteemed career as well. He has been the director of the trauma center of Boston for 30 years. He is also the head of many other trauma organizations and the professor psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine, as well as having authored over a hundred scientific papers. So please, join me now in welcoming Bessel van der Kolk. 

00:01:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Wow, wow. Who would have expected this. I'm stunned by how flexible all of you are. I've gone to budget presentations this morning and they all contradicted every other, ah, got li-- how does people go to sort it out? And I'm going to inflict your par-- my particular take on things which is different from other takes-- or things. And good luck to you trying to figure out it a lot, ah, stuff. Since I'm-- over the years have become popular and lot of people have opinions about it, but I always like to start, there's a movie-- some movie that shows what we're dealing with. So we start with a common ground. So this is one way of-- one movie I'll show you. 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN The ingredients to take. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN You could just buy one. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN It couldn't make it. 

00:02:25
[sil.] 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN Is that all? Anything else? 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN I want that back. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN I never thought of anything else. I haven't got 15 here in my pocket. Look, I'm done with it. Let's go. How much is this? What's wrong with this one? Eh? Look, okay, what about this one then? 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN No! 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN Why? You haven't got one of these? Eh? I've got you some sweets then. What's your problem? What is your problem? Cristy(ph)! 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN No! 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Jesus! What are you looking at? 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN What are you crying for? I've seen kids who've really got a reason to cry if you (inaudible ) your arms and legs? Your (inaudible ) hasn't been shut off. You use-- none of you used to know. Why you have to look here? 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Get off from here before they call somebody. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN I've seen people on fire. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN You should keep him locked off.

00:04:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So that is really PTSD. So people saying-- say, "Oh, just process of traumatic memories or just have been thinking about positive things in life." I think you're not really recognizing that people with PTSD at least some of the time even in the-- in other reality. Ah, one of the most striking things you'll see it again in next step is where you are caught in your relieving of the trauma, you don't see anybody else. You're not here. You do not talk, you do not recognize, you are living somewhere else. And so, our challenge is to help you to become fully alive in the presence when the brain has become rewired to, uhm, to be somewhere else and not to see what's going on. So this is type, ah, ah, the following tape is the tape I've shown hundreds of times because it shows the, the core issue of what I've been telling to these people, the core therapeutic dilemma and also the hope of how people can get better.

UNKNOWN Story as I, as I take it down last week, and... 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN You start in the weekend? 

00:05:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So this is Steve Lavrov(ph) 20 years ago who was then assistant professor at Yale and he just learned EMDR. This bizarre technique where you wiggle your fingers in front of people's eyes and like-- I was a professor at Harvard at the time and said, "Get away from me," like none-- no, no this cultish stuff. And Steve(ph) like many other EMDR people had become sort of the Jehovah's witness type of person. All right, so like this is the greatest thing ever, uhm,-- got to see, it's amazing and I said, "Get away from me, get away from me." Uhm, and this tape immediately already start to irritate me because what it showed is a dilemma that I always struggle with. And that's the, the moment it is all-- I have a lot of talk, just talk with people about each other. Ah, that very statement is almost impossible statement. If people talk about it, could talk about trauma, they wouldn't have been traumatized. Ah, the whole system of the brain that has to do with cognition, understanding, figuring things out and reproducing the experience actually gets the story. Ah, so people tell you the part of the story that's not traumatic cuz the real trauma is split-off and is acted out as you see here. And move somebody in three sessions from that to that. Don't do any EMDR. But if you don't-- not do this, is it responsible to continue to do what you're doing and learn this? That's a question we all need to ask ourselves. Bi-- very big question for me because you know, I'm a-- up and coming professor at Harvard and everybody hates real techniques. And I put my jeopardy in-- on the line by studying EMDR and indeed it had some bad consequences even though. Ah, say-- see, you take some of this.

00:07:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, we start doing some studies, our clinic and eventually you go to NIMH and do, ah, NIMH do-- NIMH funded study comparing what I thought then, and probably still think now all of this, many other techniques that could do the same thing. Uhm, the best psychological treatment I know for trauma, EMDR versus the best drug for trauma, height on the drug treatment side-- those track records made possible for me to get the money, and we did the study. 

00:08:10
EMDR vs. Fluoxetine vs. Placebo CAPS Scores pre-treatment, Post treatment (12 wks), 2 month Follow-up and 6 month follow up 

00:08:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, and what you see here, we enrolled a hundred people, ah, few of them, uhm, got nothing-- a pill placebo-- and they got more than a third better. And I said so sure that if in eight weeks of treatment you can't get your patients once they are better. You have to really examine what you're doing because you'd been beaten by an in urge pill. Uhm, and, so when people tell me I have this great treatment, I always have to ask, "So this is compare-- is it in your pill or something else?" Because people start believing in things that maybe just a function of you're just being, just a wonderful person or if your patient have got lot of relief from just seeing somebody who is nice with it. So it doesn't seem to beat. Of course it was likely better, not so very significant. And EMDR was a lot better. So there's 8 weeks. We stop the study and see people have got-- have a good life, I'll see you in 2 months to see how you're doing, 2 months later the, uhm, Prozac people little bit worse, EMDR people are a little bit better. And then we say, "Can we see you again 6 months?" Six months later the Prozac people are a little bit worse again and the EMDR people are basically asymptomatic. This is the best outcome study of PT-- treatment outcome study of PTSD ever done. Ah, so how come you don't know about it? Uhm, it's interesting that we do the research and we got a data back. I said, "Boy, we got to make the front page of the New York Times Science section." And my now executive director of the clinic says, "Bessel, the delusional. Remember we did, we wiggled our fingers. Nobody is going to take this seriously." And then we have published this and a lot people still say, that's nonsense. They feel-- that bigger their fingers they cannot feel somebody good. But why do you do research? To show that something works. And this is still the best treatment outcome study of PTSD done. Okay.

HR (bpm) Autonomic arousal following onset of eye movements, Sack et al, 2008 

00:10:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, then the question is, "How does it work?" Have we have done a whole bunch of studies on the mechanism of one de-- detailed result-- ongoing? But, one of our students did this study where you hook people up while doing EMDR and the most striking things was you know, there was something about eye movements that calmed the brain down, a decrease physiological arousal. And that makes all sense to me because I think anything that you can do to calm down people's physiological arousal, anything that help people to be safe and still inside will be helpful. Let me give you an example. Some people who I like a lot right now are doing NMDA research, ecstasy research. Ah, intriguing. I've looked at the data. That's the only data that I've seen that come as close to the good results of EMDR anywhere. And this is perfect sense to me. What does ecstasy do? It makes people feel calm and safe. The usual calm and safe in your body, you can revisit, that's horrible scene. You can say, "Oh, this happened to me a long time ago." And you can sort of accept that it has happened and go on with your life. Ah, the thing that gets in the way of getting he-- healed from PTSD is that whenever you think about it, you go crazy. Whenever you think about it, you become upset. And so, if you can revisit it while you feel perfectly calm, you can feel, "Yeah, that's a horrible event that happened to me." And if it's terrible, I really feel bad for me that this happened to me. But you know, that was in 1984 and today is 2014 or whenever. And so, once you can really look at it from a very quiet piece point of view and see who you were back then, you can say, "Yeah, this is what happened to me." Life dealt (inaudible ) but today I'm in Anaheim and I will go to Disney World tonight I learn tonight, and no-- today is the day. Okay, so it's large to make the separation. 

00:12:20
Good end-state function: CAPS score below 20 

00:12:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So the question must, uhm, it's nice when people get better but the question is, do people get cured? Because all these research here-- about here is about people statistically improving from their PTSD. It's a very nice to have this statistical improvement, but the question is are you cured? Ah, so there's, ah, measure for the cure and then turned out after 8 weeks by five EMDR people is totally cured one of-- uhm, 10, ah, Prozac people. And then 2 months later, they've end up to 38%, Prozac people are gone. Six months later, up to 60%. Some testing there. 

00:13:05
Positive end-state function (CAPS greater than 20) EMDR Fluoxetine 

00:13:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And then of course we managed you the big issue. And the big issue is that we have a concept of PTSD that was based on (inaudible ). And it turned out to be a diagnosis which I've-- which you never had the good scientific underpinnings. It's all politics in time it's very much involving that. And we have a diagnosis that is very good people who have car accidents, people who are raped, or people who are adults who have bad horrendous experience. But majority of our practice are not people with car accidents and rapes or people who have been assaulted one time cuz the majority of our practice are people who have been traumatized at home. And the context of their attachment relationships. And there-- introduce a whole other component of trauma story which is the attachment story. And the attachment story keeps being left out because if you get hurt, particularly when you're growing up by the people you love, you get a totally different adaptation to trauma than if some stranger does it to you. And that as an issue we haven't written a lot about but it's still not really in the mainstream and as a result, the majority of the patients that we see are being educated to a guess treatments that are not particularly effective for him because none of these treatments have really been tried for people who are victims of child abuse and incest which is a different category. Uhm, so, as like we have it, our research sample was exactly one-half adults who have been raped, tortures, car accidents, and the other half were abuses children. And we, we divide up these two groups, there's very different outcomes. The one time, adult also trauma did extraordinarily well. For me, when somebody comes in my office a car accident or after a rape, I say this great confidence, you know, there's about 80% chance that in a few weeks you'll be out of here, you'll be cured. So to my mind that's no longer, ah, a research challenge, it's still, it's wonderful clinical thing to see, uhm, but that's, that's, that's settled. Uhm, but isn't settled is this issue. The issue of early childhood trauma and trauma at the hands of your, of your parents. And I was going to talk about it. There's no-- I'll touch it tomo-- ah,-- tomorrow, in my longer workshop. Uhm, but that's really the challenge in the population and has to do with safety and relationships that gets acted out in many different ways. 

00:15:35
Comparison EMDR vs Prozac (van der Kolk et al, 2007) and CBT vs PFT (Schnurr et al, 2007) EMDR Fluoxetine CBT PFT 

00:15:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, so we publish our data and then we went into an interesting thing about having to do with politics. So our data were as follows. We always use the same instrument, uhm, people have, ah, traumatic drop on the CAPS PTSD rating score for EMDR after 8 weeks and 6 months later they had a very low PTSD score. Ah, our Prozac people, did most of badly, did it about as well as most existing studies but is dropped just below 50 which is the cut off point for PTSD. And 6 months later, it sort of back-- very big difference. So, the months after we published our data, the largest CBT study ever was published or similar sample and did the topics of, of CBT much largest study than ours. You'll see as great impact. And then after 12 weeks of CBT, uhm, patients have some drop in their score but still were above the PTSD score so that it felt better they were not secured by any means. Six months later, there's still have PTSD, the control group Present Focus Treatment, uhm, supposedly in earth doesn't do very much, and 6 months later, there is no difference between these two groups. And the summary of this paper say, published in very procedural journalist says, "This proves that CBT isn't effective treatment for PTSD." It's true, statistically speaking, this difference is statistically significant, it's great for research. Clinically, it is a field study. It is interesting to me that the study that people don't say, "Oh, boy, it didn't work. Let's try something else." Uhm, so it's interesting that you know, all the people on this study, ah, (inaudible ) develops an interest in something I'll talk about tomorrow and maybe little bit today, and something called neurofeedback, ah, rewiring the brain. So we decided to write a grant together and she takes the lead in it neurofeedback. And she says, uhm, to NIMH, ah, research shows that CBT is the best treatment for PTSD and I go, "Actually, remember our studies? Your study? (inaudible )?" And she writes me a lovely note back about statistics and says, "Bessel, because our sample was much larger yours-- the statistical difference between this two is the same as the statistical difference between these two." And so, it was just as effective and go, okay. So now you tell your patients, we have two, four of a treatment. We can either do 8 weeks of treatment and you have an 80% chance to be totally cured at the end of 8 weeks. And we have another treatment that gets you to be slightly less posttraumatic because Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and it takes 12 weeks, which one do you prefer? And so, there's a lot of funny politics in our field. Next please. 

00:19:00
Acute trauma 

00:19:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, next piece is what happen when people got traumatized? And to m-- my mind sort of hallmark became what happened in 9/11, very far away from you guys. Uhm, but we all had a collective trauma. And again, we had to-- chance to look at, ah, what happens to us collectively and individually. And so we saw these pictures in television. And when I showed this picture to clinicians and ask them, "What is going on here?" Almost every clinician I ever show you this says, these people are scared or they are panic. And I said, "How do you know?" That's not what you see. What do you see? People are running. So we jumped over the evidence into our mental construct but the reality is that when people got traumatized, their body start to move. And of their bodies move, and they are able to escape from the trauma, they don't get PTSD and if their bodies are held down, traps, something is lying on top of you, somebody is keeps you from escaping that you're stress hormones keep pumping, a developed force may stress to it. It's actually a big thing is whether you're able to move in response to a trauma. And indeed, in New York, almost nobody developed PTSD after 9/11, it became an-- weakness or trauma but everybody moved and everybody moved, not only moved but moved in a particular direction. They move in the direction of home. So this is about-- happens when you meet something terrible. You meet something terrible and you do something to escape the danger, and then you run from. And if you come home and if somebody says, "Oh, my god, let's give you a bath, let's feed you, let's clean you up, let's take care of you, you gotta be okay." And your physiology will calm down and your oxytocin, and your stress hormones will come to rest because of the attachment system. But if you come home, and somebody says, "You stupid person. This is all your fault." Uhm, "Look what you did. Look how stupid you are." And it won't go away. And so the big thing is how you get, uhm, received. So this is the picture, the picture of the last page of my anatomy textbook in medical school. This is what happens when a person gets assaulted by a terrible event. As you'll see, the frontal lobe of the brain shuts down, the limbic system takes over and you start to move and to fight and so the different part of your brain takes over. There's nothing to do with reason or understanding. The example I gave this morning was that-- you don't have to raise your hand. But, is there anybody in this room who has ever said, cruel, nasty and irresponsible things to somebody they loved? Anybody? Ah, ah, and, uhm, and after you said to that person, "Oh, honey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that." And if your honey wants to keep this thing or relationship with you, you'll say, "I know, the other tough day in the office or your mother called yesterday or something." Uhm, but what your honey should say is, "I know honey, but your limbic system meant every word you said, and so whenever you're gonna get hyper aroused when you find my socks on the floor, the toothpaste off the toothpaste got-- or whatever, your frontal lobe will shut down, the limbic system will take over and you'll do, do the same stuff to me as you did today. So, can you get some limbic system therapy?" And then you look at up in the yellow pages and the L, and there'll be does, limbic system therapy because the whole psychology field is ought to thinking and figuring out and we should not get angry on doing anger management. And anger management works beautifully as long as you don't get angry because the, the frontal disappears and everything you know goes out of the window again. Many have says, anything we've learned about traumatic stress is that when that stuff takes over, the frontal lobe goes off line. And the all the stuff that you have learned makes you look like a total fool. So, why are traumatized people so ashamed about themselves? I heard other people say, they feel ashamed about themselves because what he did during the trauma that may also be an issue. No. The thing is that they continuously make fools out of themselves like the guy in this movie who business people of-- an alienated people make-- people scare to them, how can you makes it very hard to be alive? And it goes to the world like, ah, innocent person because you cannot trust that you will not humiliate yourself. That is the big issue. The issue for us is how do we do limbic system therapy? And (inaudible ) make this come to an end. And so, those you heard Peter Levine speak across and again later on this afternoon. Ah, Peter does-- is one of these people who does good limbic system therapy. He doesn't use primarily cognition but uses working with the body and making the body feel safe as does EMDR some of the time. So, we'll skip this. So, this one is my favorite picture. This, this little boy, uhm, now big boy. He's name (inaudible ) and he went to, ah, P.S. 234, ah, primary school that looks at the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks. So, he's in the classroom, he seems to playing flying the World Trade Center, smoke and fire comes out that advance through the classroom and he and his dad become two out of 50,000 people running for the rest of the day. On the-- at 9 o'clock of September 12 he draws his picture. Two weeks later I visit the family, I love the picture, and I buy it from him for $100 and it's in my new book. And so here's the, here's the picture. So I say to them-- a 5-year-old boy so but if you see so-- I saw the plane in the World Trade Center, a lot of smoke and fire, I saw people jumping out of the World Trade Center and so firefighters and I say, huh. So what is seen over h ere, he says, "That's a tarpaulin." I said, "What's a tarpaulin doing there?" He says, "So that the people who jumped out the World Trade Center they will be okay. And so this is a 5-year-old boy who cannot do with that presence-- you can't do what our presence didn't do, ah, but as a presence do, he hears a bad piece of news, and said "I've got to kill, huh." Cuz he has the primitive animal response if you got hurt, you kill. And as a nation we did that. This 5-year-old boy has a working medial prefrontal cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, all the stuff that he needs for creativity. And he thinks next time that this happens, I can do something different. Now, no one is not traumatized boy. And why he is not traumatized? Is that he can use his imagination. And so any treatment that expands people's capacity for imagination particularly any treatment that expose these people to similar things as happened during their trauma but it happened different outcome, they'll be helpful because when you're traumatized, a particular sound, a particular smell, particular voice will make your brain to do exactly the same thing as before. Uhm, and one of the most striking things about being a traumatized person you should le-- do not learn from experience. Ah, and many CBT people do not learn from experience either because they keep doing the same CBT stuff that who do not learn from experience, right? The de-- deficit is that people whose frontal lobe is gone do not learn from experience? So how you provide people with experiences that actually helps them to rewire and rethink what they're doing. Okay, I'll talk more about it-- more after them because I cannot all put into a simple 1-hour lecture. Uhm, but what's important here is to see why the impact is in different parts of the central nervous system. And so, when we introduce ourselves to each other and I say to you, my name is Bessel van der Kolk, ah, I mean to say to you, the name of my frontal lobe is Bessel van der Kolk. The rest of me, I've no control over whether I like you or not, it just happens. Whether I got hungry right now or not, it just happens. Whether I feel pleasant being here or hate this, it just happens. All these things just happened to you. You have no control over it. And all that stuff sits over here. And traumas impact is over here. And traumas impact is on the limbic system and on the core arousal system of the brain. 

00:28:30

00:28:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So here is our brain laid open. This is reptilian brain, the part of the brain that become the world in, uhm, uhm, this is thus for us but though babies can do, what can babies do, they can sleep, they can eat, they can be away, they can put it, it can be, and they can breathe especially it. These are things that most therapist ignore. These are also the issues that get really messed up when you get traumatized. Where does trauma hits, hyperarousal, not being able to sleep, not being able to calm yourself down, getting constipation, getting diarrhea, getting each of these disorders. All way back in a very pre-- premature part of your brain. And so, if much of the trauma is there, and there's a part of brain that you cannot really unless you're advance yoga practitioner which I am not. Ah, you cannot really make yourself go to sleep. Okay, you make yourself not hungry, okay you make yourself not being in love to somebody or in love with somebody. Ah, these things just-- they just happened to you. And so, the, the biggest issue in dealing with traumatic stress is to calm down reptilian brain and that means that you need to speak the language of the reptilian brain. And the language of the reptilian brain is touch, breathing, with movement and synchrony without a be-- moving. Throwing balls together. Sitting on hammock together, putting blanket on yourself, touching each other, all stuff that we as therapist don't do. Some of them you shouldn't do, some of them we could do but certainly in our clinic we explore these things in their great detail and all the therapeutic programs I now do because you cannot bypass the reptilian brain as long as you don't feel safe in your body, as long as you cannot breathe and as I'll-- getting to the second. Uhm, the-- as long as the basement of the brain is working, the top of the brain won't work either. The second part is your limbic system, the limbic system, our limbic system is the part of our brain that sort of evolved in the first 6 years of life more than anything else and before we had much language. It's a part of our brain that creates a map of who we are in relationship to our surroundings. And so if you're an adored, cherished little kid you become an adored cherished little person. And no matter how bad life treats you, the f-- the core of I'm adorable person is almost certain to stay with you unless some horrible, horrible things happened to you. And if in the first 6 years of your life people ignore you, neglect you, abuse you and call you a piece of shit, that becomes your limbic system and you get to see yourself as fundamentally a blot on the face of this earth and you will most likely be depressed and you both feel bad-- badly is very likely that you will take drugs to make yourself feel better. Ah, again, the limbic system also is not particularly amendable to cognitive interventions. Right? If-- we had a patient who has been chronically neglected and abused like 80% of the California prison systems, systems are people who grew up in foster homes. Interesting fact, isn't it? And telling people, "Oh, you should be proud of yourself, you should feel good about yourself," doesn't really go into that limbic brain and make people feel you-- feel great about themselves. The only way you can feel the limbic brain feel good about itself is by deeply engaging in physical actions that give the sense of pleasure and connection with other people as bypassing consciousness but really doing it.

You are in the hospital emergency room lying on a stretcher, but feeling as if you were standing on its head. You hear doctor's words echoing, asking if you are pregnant. You try hard to understand, but just can't remember. Your little boy is talking to someone in another room, but you don't hear Katie. When the doctor comes in, you know something is wrong. He tells you have been in an accident. Your heart skips a beat, and you feel sweaty and nauseous. Then you hear him say: 'we could not do anything for your little girl. She is dead.' Your body feels heavy and you start to cry. 

00:32:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And so my favorite program for our most abused adolescents is theater groups, and we say worked very hard on creating and acting and moving and doing stuff that makes them feel in tune with other people. Our time is running out. So let me go quickly. And so I've o-- you know, I mean psychotherapist I see about 12 patients per week in my office and my patient continually tell me the limitations of everything that I do because some things work for some people and they don't work for others. And anybod-- as long as you see patients, you will not become a religious fanatic because you'll know that there is no one answer to people. And in my clinic, everybody has to see patients and taken very seriously because otherwise they get embedded to their system rather than to their patients which is the core. So, but we also-- always do research and so I did not want-- we did the first neuroimaging research of PTSD. 

00:33:35

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Ah, and what we see here, these are eight people having a flashback, ah, this is the front of the brain, back of the brain, right of the brain, left of the brain. So cuts through the brain like this. And what you see is that when people are into their flashback mode, what lights up is the right limbic brain, that's the emotional brain that makes you feel as awful as you do when you are freaked out, afraid, anxious, worried, etcetera, so it doesn't comes from your frontal lobe, it comes from the limbic brain. Uhm, so it does, does not surprise but it's nice to see it. Uhm, second thing is that you-- we saw, and then people have a flashback, it actually lights up the area of the brain, you see things. But to my mind, the most important finding and really new find of the study was that as people go into their trauma, they shut down the left anterior prefrontal cortex which contains Broca's area. Broca's area is a speech center of the brain and here we see right in front, in front of our face that if you start talking about your trauma and you start going there, you see but the-- you saw on that lady in the videotape maybe the closer she gets to her trauma, the more discombobulated she becomes and the less articulate she becomes. Ah, because the deeper part of your brain going to overdrive, shutting down the li-- the linguistic and verbal parts of your brain. And so seeing that, I thought that's really interesting because I was trained as a, as a psychoanalyst. And I thought, I love, I love talking, I mean I love talking, yeah. How about, ah, you know, when you're really in the middle of your trauma worry fills you. You become dumbfounded or as Shakespeare said, you get struck with speechless terror, he knew everything. Uhm, and so, so after you see that, can we continue to rely exclusively on words and language and expl-- explanatory mode to help traumatized people.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Particularly if we see that, when people in their trauma, actually it's a more lobe(ph) thing in the brain is that, one side of the brain lights up, the right side of the brain. And another part of the brain shuts down, the left side of the brain. So, the left side of the brain is the part of my brain that makes you possible for you to talk and to explain things to you and to be verbal, and they'll be smart. And the right side of my brain is a part of me that is-- or is not a attuned to you on the emotional level. Uhm, so when you traumatized, you-- your analytical part, the cognitive behavior-- the cognitive part of your brain shuts down and all that's left is your scanning capacity to see who is dangerous and who was safe.

00:36:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay, I'm just going to such a short brief time so I can just, okay, let me do this. Uhm, colleague of mine, Marilyn Cloitre, ah, does a PTSD research with sexually abused adolescent. And, ah, nice CBT protocol and at the end of the treatments, some people get better, some people don't. And she is convinced that what makes people better is that it warms this therapeutic relationship. I think many of us would think that such a core thing that determines whether people are better or not. So she measured it, and turns out that the warmth of this therapeutic relationship is not the predictor about whether people get better or not. Ah, very real thing for therapist to hear that how lovely or how peo-- how much people like you does not really fundamentally changed whether people have PTSD or not, interesting. And you know, we have to-- science. Sometimes, if you take it seriously you know, and so she keeps looking at, and she says about there's something that changes people. And then she throws in, ah, effect that called negative mood regulation. It turns out that if the therapy leads to better mood regulation, people get better. So we are only as good therapist as we are mood regulators. Anybody has trouble with that, huh? You're only as good as you're able to help people to feel calm and safe, and safe in their bodies. Ah, and if that's the case, and it is the case, ah, then of course we all take courses all the time on affect regulation except we don't. There's not a single Ph.D. program in psychology or medical school in the country that teaches future graduates affect regulation even though that's by far the most important part of the good therapy. And so, how do you learn affect regulation? By going to karate studio and going to a yoga studio and learning how to do chi gong and learning how to do all that stuff that real therapist frown on except the California which is great, and, and in Boston also. Ah, uhm, so how you learn to, to regulate yourself. There's two ways of regulating yourself. Thus, you can regulate yourself from the top down or from the bottom up. I'll talk about more about this tomorrow, it's just too much information for you guys right now.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK These are yoga study. No, no, I'll tel-- I will tell you about it obviously. And what it-- uhm, so bottom up doing it to regulate your brainstem. How do you regulate your brainstem? Through bre--breathing. If you start breathing very slowly, and evenly and you really trained your breath to become calm, you increase something called heart rate variability. Heart rate variability is a measure of how well your brainstem can deal with stress.

00:39:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And we can see here, ah, I'll talk about more tomorrow but basically Heart Rate Variability measures how calm your brainstem is, and how well it can be for challenges. Traumatized people have terrible Heart Rate Variability. Traumatized people barely breathe, they are just so uptight, they sit like this and as long as you have Logger Heart Rate Variability, this is a core regulation part of your whole organism, you're at higher risk to develop heart disease, cancer, diabetes, (inaudible ) illnesses and you're more likely to become depressed, anxious and out of control. These are master area of the body by learning to regulate your brainstem. You can learn to regulate this. And so what's interesting to me is that, we live in the big world and the world has become much ber-- bigger since I become-- I was little kid. I grew up in Northern Europe as the-- most of your ancestors, people in the room. And so Northern European tradition which came to America also is that if you feel bad, you just take a swig, you take a swig of alcohol. And so, Northern Europe is a deeply alcoholic culture as is United States which is totally adopted that and so there's ads on TV that say, "If you feel bad, ask your doctor for Zoloft, ask your doctor about this stuff, ask your doctor to take some golden pill to make you feel se-- self-more better." There is fundamentally nothing in our culture including our psychological psychiatric culture that tells people that you can control the physiology of your own body. And then you go to China, and you go to India, you see all these people in this weird stuff, huh, ah, and why do they do that? They do that because they know that as long as you don't regulate your brainstem, you're go to freak out, you're good after time. And so, those are cultures that happens and not have develops this yakking(ph) and alcoholic part that you also do alcoholic, everybody else. But it has developed, ah, system to really regulate the stuff.

yoga versus dbt Yoga for PTSD Clinician Administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS) From: Clinical Implications of neuroscience research in PTSD, van de Kolk BA, Annals of the New York Academy of Science 1071:277-93, 2006. 

00:41:55
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So that's we like to investigate, ah, and we went to NIMH and we did a study on yoga for very, very, uhm, and be at people with many, many years of treatments mainly incest victims. And we randomly assign them to either DBT class of yoga class. And after 12 weeks of DBT they still felt terrible and after 12 weeks of yoga, their PTSD has traumatically improved. And then we did a body rating scale and so after 12 weeks of DBT, they felt terrible by the body before they felt terrible by, by just afterwards and after 12 weeks of yoga people like their bodies, they felt better. And then we did some more studies on it in NIMH.

Does yoga change HRV in Normals? Mean Standard deviation 95% confidence F P value interval Yoga for chronic PTSD Van der Kolk Emerson Spinazzola "Yoya is about looking inward, instead of outward, and listening to my body. A lot of my survival has been geared around never doing these things." "I have been refusing to listen to my body, which is such an important part of who I am. I am so disconnected from my body when I cut it". "In the yoga class I tried just noticing the sensations in my body and I noticed that when we did that pose where you thread one arm through the other and twist I started to feel like the pelvic part of my body, front and back, was all there was to me". "I slowly learned to just have my feelings, without being hijacked by them". "Life is more manageable: I am more attuned to my day and more present in the moment, I a more tolerant of physical touch". "My husband and I are enjoying watching movies cuddled together in bed, a huge step, I finally can feel intimate with my husband". 

00:42:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So we did this yoga studies coming out next month. And indeed we find out that yoga changes Heart Rate Variability and then yoga did extraordinarily well. And I would like to read you, uhm, to actually it's the thing. Now, when you do something new, don't do anything to new, don't do anything new. It will feel-- very bad for you, mental health. Uhm, so you know, I bi-- I published a bunch of articles in the American Journal of Psychiatry because I used to be big time psychopharmacologist until I discovered the fact of psychopharmacology wasn't all that helpful for my patient. And so, we do yoga, so I decided, "Hey, they know me there, I'll send them an article about yoga and same methodologies, same measures, same everything. Let's see what they say." And I have these wonderful cases too. You know, it says, patient one who has eight hospitalizations for depression and suicidal behavior who was a chronic self-cutter before she came to see me. And she writes this after yoga, stunning. She says, "Yoga is about looking inward, instead of outward, and listening to my body. A lot o-- of my survival has been about not-- none of those things. I ignore my body. Uhm, I'm so disconnected from my body when I cut it. Uhm, and yoga class, I did-- I put it by arms from my head and they suddenly start to feel my body come to life and feel my pelvic bone, ah, my pelvis. I certainly learned to just have my feelings instead of being highjacked by them. Life is more, ah, manageable and I'm more attuned to my body and my present in the moment. I am more tolerant of physical touch. My husband and I are watching movies, cuddled up together bed. I can finally feel intimate with my husband." So we have this kick-ass statistical data and this kick-ass history and the American Journal Psychiatry says, "Your clinical case detracts from scientific value of your study." And they go like, "Do you know, anybody-- do you know anything else that help suppression with lifelong self-regulation, depression to finally be able to grow up as a husband and feel intimate and relax, etcetera, etcetera." So it's funny, you know, it's sort of hard time having these things done. That's all I have time before right now. Let me show-- see, there's one more thing, if you come back tomorrow, I have a long time.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK One final thing, and this final thing, this comes from the research of Joseph LeDoux who is one of the great neuroscientists of our age. And what he shows is that we have this rational brain, this frontal lobe that server where we live, where we aware and we have this animal brain to back us that serve-- runs show much of the time. What he shows is that you're rational, figuring out on the steady(ph) part of the brain actually has no pathways to your emotional brain, you cannot get there. But that's not the end of the story. The next part of the story is that your brain is build up out of a number of different components. Our brain is a social brain judging by this conference, we are extremely social animals. You could have read everybody's books in your home and then learned much more about they come here and they're running around you. And so we're social animals with-- are with other people. That part of the brain is great but it cannot get to you, your emotional brain, it cannot really do your limbic system therapy. There's a part of your brain that runs through the middle, I called the Mohawk of the brain, it runs through the front here to the back. That is your self-perception and that part of your brain is the only way you can change your, your emotional brain. The only way you can really change is by feeling yourself, knowing yourself, and building up the self-observational capacity. Ah, certainly there will be some talks about mindfulness, by, ah, Dan Siegel and other people. And so, to my, to my mind mindfulness is not the cure for PTSD but it's an instrument without which you cannot get better. And the only way you can really become the master of your own ship is by deeply, again, to know your interiority, your internal self. And a whole bunch of research shows that as you do that regularly, and you learn to observe yourself, and feel yourself, you can build up the brain structures that have to do with being able to be in charge of your emotional self. Thank you.

UNKNOWN Thank you so much. It's wonderful.
