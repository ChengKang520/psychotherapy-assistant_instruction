SHANNON DERMER Hi, welcome. I'm Dr. Shannon Dermer from the Governor State University. I'm the Chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling. And I'm here with Dr. Patricia Robey today. And we're going to be discussing group work, working with groups and leadership. And I'm going to have Dr. Robey say a little bit about her background working with groups and teaching about groups. And then we will discuss a little a bit about some major processes and major concepts in working with groups before you do a demonstration. So Dr. Robey, welcome.

PATRICIA ROBEY Thank you. Groups are fun and challenging and a wonderful way to accomplish a lot in counseling and in a lot of other places where there are groups in process. I am an Associate Professor at Governors State University and a licensed Professional Counselor. And as part of both those roles, I lead a lot of groups, I teach about group work. And it is one of the very existing things that we do as counselors. So it's my pleasure to be talking about that today. 

00:01:30
SHANNON DERMER Good. Now you started out by saying they're exciting, they're wonderful, they're awesome groups… you know, but I had to say when I was a student, I was like I do not want to take the group class, I do not want to do groups. And it wasn't because I was afraid to work with multiple people because I work with couples and families. I just, groups, it just didn't capture my interest. But over time, I learned what an effective, efficient, wonderful modality that group work can be. 

00:02:00
PATRICIA ROBEY It's interesting that you mention that because in the initial group class that we have here where it's a peer group situation, people write in their journals especially at the end, I didn't have much confidence in groups until now that I've experienced a group process. I didn't see how it would be relevant. And I think that's part of that process of getting a clear picture of what a group can be. And so when I and so when I was thinking what I'd like to talk about today, one of the quotes about group that I thought I would bring to this discussion is Kottler said about groups which that it's a form of chaos in action. 

00:02:40
Group Work: Dealing with Problems in a Group 

00:02:40
"Group work is a form of chaos in action" (Kottler, 2001, p, ix.) 

00:02:40
Group work is a specialization that requires specific training that focuses on group management and group interventions. 

00:02:40
Group leadership involves facilitating an experiential process while still being mindful of the risks involved in participation. 

00:02:40
PATRICIA ROBEY And what he meant by that and it's the truth is that as the group leader, as you're watching, there are so many different things going on at the same time. And everything has importance, some more importance than another. And while you're focusing on this, something else might be happening over here. So to me that's part of what pumps my creativity now that I know how to run a group. When I was a student, I didn't have a clear picture. I had a lot of anxieties coming in about was I going to be… I mean I just had no skills. And so that leads to the realization that group counseling is a specialization in itself. So just in the same way that we going through a lot of courses in individual counseling and in vocational counseling, marriage and family counseling, it's important for people to recognize that group counseling needs its due. And so in our program we have the peer counseling courses and then we have a whole practicum that's devoted to group counseling that is working with members of the community. But even beyond that, I was reading, and Kory says that people need a lot more training outside of school even. So when you into internship and you get your license… it's a specialization, so you need to get more information. So for example, he said to run a task group. I think he said, about 25 more hours and if you want to run a therapeutic group, there's another 45 hours. I mean you can go on and on and of course, there's specializations in that, conference in that in particular. 

00:04:30
SHANNON DERMER Now for up now for CACREP, usually when we talk about a specialization, we're talking about the areas that you can get accredited in… you know, like marital couple and family, career counseling, addictions counseling. It's not a specialization in that way, yet the accreditation standards, at least for the counseling association do recognize it as something special in that people are not only required to have course work in it, they're required to have experiential experiences while they're doing their course work. And then I say recently, but it was the last iteration of the accreditation standards. It was required that you actually have group hours during your internship which I don't believe had been required in the iteration before that. So even though it's not a specialization that you get accreditation in for the accreditation standards, they do recognize it as something special and different from individual, couple, family counseling. 

00:05:25
PATRICIA ROBEY That's true. And also thinking about from the ACA perspective in the code of ethics, there's even 2 codes that specifically refer to group work. One is about the screening process and the other one is about how to protect clients. But it's very interesting that there's only two. 

00:05:45
ACA Code of Ethics-A.9 Group Work 

00:05:45
"A.9.aScreening: To the extent possible, counselors select members whose needs and goals are compatible with goals of the group, who will not impede the group process, and whose wellbeing will not be jeopardized by the group essence". 

00:05:45
"A.9.b.Protecting Clients: In a group setting, counselors take reasonable precautions to protect clients from physical, emotional, or psychological trauma". 

00:05:45
PATRICIA ROBEY And it's those two. So it comes to do no harm. And also be sure that you're kind of front end loading. So be sure that people know what they're getting into when they're getting into a group process. 

00:06:00
SHANNON DERMER So there are a lot of things we could talk about with the group counseling process. One of them you mentioned with the code of ethics is confidentiality. Confidentiality gets much more complicated, I know, depending on the supervisor how you document, notes become much more complicated. But what do you want to highlight about the group process or group work today? 

00:06:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, there's a couple of things there's about understanding group dynamics in itself which is a very interesting thing. And the other thing, we'll talk a little bit about qualities of group leaders. And if we have time, maybe talk about stages in group and what the expectations are. Group dynamic, I mean that's the name of the course, group dynamics, right? 

00:06:40
SHANNON DERMER And teach us all that in next 10 minutes. 

00:06:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, that's right. And there's so many books and things that you can talk about with us. One of the things I think that's really interesting about thinking about groups is that a group is actually a system. And in a way it parallels the idea of the family systems and how you bring yourself into that what your role is which is a little bit different than working with an individual because there's a lot of things to manage. 

00:07:10
Group Dynamics 

00:07:10
A group is a system in which each member moves and influences all the other members 

00:07:10
Group members form subsystems, coalitions, and unique patterns of communication 

00:07:10
Consider what roles are assumed by members, what norms develop, how decisions are made, how conflicts are resolved 

00:07:10
Be aware of process as well as content, look for the meaning of events in the group not just behavior 

00:07:10
PATRICIA ROBEY And just like in a family system when one person does something, it influences the group. So you've probably seen that idea of having a our module and if you tap one thing, the whole module tries to adjust. Well, in the same way, the group does that. 

00:07:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:07:25
PATRICIA ROBEY And you have in groups, you have the subsystem, you have coalitions, ways people communicate and, you know, they're always communicating whether it's the kind of communication you want or not as something else. And then as a leader in considering dynamics, you want to think about what roles members assume in the same way that families assume roles. You'll see people who have natural leadership, you see people who hold back, people who like to poke the fires. 

00:07:55
SHANNON DERMER That would have been me. 

00:08:00
PATRICIA ROBEY I could see that. You know, how does a group make decisions and how they resolve conflicts, and all of those things evolve over time because there are different stages of development. And so that's what makes it very fun. And so for counselors, group counselors, you have to look at the process as well is content because what people are talking about isn't necessarily the most important thing, but it's how they're talking about it, what meaning that they attribute to it. And of course, the other thing is the nature of the group. What is the intention of the group itself which drives what happens in the group? 

00:08:40
SHANNON DERMER So content which can be important, but also process, how they're saying things, who says things, who doesn't say things, who protects whom, you know, lots of difference process things you can look at. And I know one of the things because my specialty is marital couple and family that supervisees get overwhelmed with is the amount of information that is coming in because it's not just from one person, it's what one person is saying in that moment, but then how other people are reacting to that information. So there's just so much. So what do you think about all the millions of bits of information coming in when you have not just three or four people like a family, although we do work with a family of 18 once, but when you have, you know, six to eight people in the room. 

00:09:30
PATRICIA ROBEY And that could be considered to be a small group in some cases depending. It's an interesting thing because people don't know each other coming in. You can hope or assume that they have similar expectations for the group, but they don't necessarily, and so they don't have a relationship already built in which could be a plus or a minus because families, when they come in, they usually can figure they have a conflictual relationship. With new group, you know, there are not necessarily things there. So you do have to be more managerial when you're dealing with that kind of a group. The nice thing about the groups is that it can, when lead properly and facilitated properly, it can provide a lot of opportunities for support, for nurturance, intimacy. It's a learning experience where the members get a chance to learn from each other. They get feedback. Ideally, they come in… I mean there's a reason for the group right. And so a group comes in, even if it's just a support group, they want to get something from there. They want to make changes in their lives. And when managing the group, going to what I think you were referring to before is that a way to manage that is to use the group itself to work the group, if that makes some sense to you, so that I, as a group leader don't have to have all thing answers. In fact, I don't want the group relationship to be like this with me. What I want is for the group to wean themselves and I'm going to wean them from me and so then they start working with each other in semi leadership in a way. And so my job then could be to notice what's going on in the group and bring that to their attention so that they can work it through. 

00:11:20
SHANNON DERMER So might help point out the process a little bit, but you don't always process it, especially as the group goes on. For them, you help them to be able to process that with each other. 

00:11:30
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right. And with that comes… often there's the stages of groups which I mentioned before, that there's often a conflictual stage where they're trying to figure things out. And through that experience, they way the people process it, it becomes emotionally charged. And then that emotional dissonance is often what leads to shift, the ability to have insight to get some work done and sometimes it doesn't. 

00:12:00
The Power of the Group Experience 

00:12:00
Groups provide support, nurturance, and an opportunity for intimacy with others. 

00:12:00
Members practice new behaviors and get constructive feedback so that more effective behavior can be utilized in the future 

00:12:00
The group atmosphere is often emotionally charged, which can initiate arousal that leads to change 

00:12:00
Groups are efficient, cost effective, and allow for diversity of options and experience 

00:12:00
PATRICIA ROBEY You don't still know where it's going to go. And then the other benefit of groups is that they're cost effective. They allow for a diverse experience and for diversity of opinion. So that's kind of nice because we need that kind of input because we all had those blind spots that are going to help us move forward. 

00:12:20
SHANNON DERMER What also, I don't think you mentioned it, but also, normalization… like to hear that other people are going through something similarly to what I am or to eve listen to how they handled something different. Like, both of our ways could have been effective, but they were different. 

00:12:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, that's right. And then in those things are where some of the challenges come in the group work. uh, As a leader, I don't want to be controlling the group necessarily, but you also have less control because you want the members to take some charge of that and it's just like in family systems, work is, you kind of have a velvet glove maybe. 

00:13:00
Challenges in group Process 

00:13:00
The leader has less control over the members' behavior than in individual sessions, safety is difficult to maintain 

00:13:00
Peer pressure influences group process and outcome. Groups may not be helpful for people who are vulnerable and shy Confidentially cannot be guaranteed 

00:13:00
One challenging member can ruin the experience for the others 

00:13:00
SHANNON DERMER One of our colleagues calls it an iron fist in a velvet glove. 

00:13:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. At least nobody knows what's coming, right. But in that same way that you need to be able to manage it because ultimately you want to try to create safety and safety comes with relationship and trust in the leader as far as that goes. And some of the other challenges that come in is peer pressure. This comes from the coalitions. That comes also from… for the students for example in the peer counseling, trying to outdo each other sometimes or you need to step up. I remember I was in a session one time in the group dynamics course where a student hadn't talked at all. And one day two people who were sitting, I think the side of her called her out and kind of forced her into communicating with the group. And she was really resistant and it stirred up a lot of heat in the group, you know, was that right thing to do or wasn't… that some were protective, somewhere encouraging, somewhere pushing. So it's again another instance where that's a challenges because you have to be able to manage that. On the other hand, and you had to be okay with that because that's the other thing. I think that's a part of group leadership. And I learned that for myself is I can't be afraid as the group leader of what's going on. I have to be able to think what's happening, what do I need to do. And in that same way, another challenge that comes up from that is that after the group is over, you can't guarantee confidentiality. 

00:14:40
SHANNON DERMER I know. That's one of things with like ethics, even talk to them as much as possible about it. And there is supposed to be confidentiality, but you can't guarantee it. 

00:14:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Right, because in an individual session, I can guarantee that I'm not telling anybody about you? 

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:14:55
PATRICIA ROBEY But in a group, you don't know when they go out. I've heard people talking about groups in restrooms or in the hallway and it's kind of appalling sometimes. So then we go back and there's a reminder of what the expectations are or what do you want for yourselves. And the other dynamic that comes into play is how one member can disrupt the whole experience. I remember, because there's lots of groups, not just counseling groups. And I remember, I was doing a training group one time. That was a mandatory group. And one of the members was not buying. He was not happy to be there and actually sat which his back to me. 

00:15:30
SHANNON DERMER Wow! 

00:15:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, for the first couple of days and he eventually, because I've charmed him, right. 

00:15:35
SHANNON DERMER Right, well because you're charming. 

00:15:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, you know. But eventually, he turned around as he started to realize this going to be good for him. But oh my goodness, and then that was like an empty hall in that place. 

00:15:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, it does bring up that balance between, do you challenge people, do you not challenge them and your whole idea that you talked about with being comfortable with being uncomfortable and I believe you also mentioned emotional dissonance that it's actually… sometimes we worry too much for our clients or for ourselves like, we have to make them comfortable. We don't want them be uncomfortable. But it's that emotional dissonance, that discomfort that often motivates us to do something different. So you don't want it to be such a high level of emotional dissonance or discomfort that someone maybe leaves the group or doesn't feel safe in the group overall, yet you don't want that so low anxiety, so low in the group that people aren't motivated to do anything different. So that's a lot of skills as a group leader. 

00:16:40
PATRICIA ROBEY A lot of skills. And that's some of the things that are characteristics of effective group leaders are, you know… shown now on the PowerPoint and it ranges all the way from the leader having an emotional presence, what you bring to the group in the same way that you bring to individual counseling. 

00:17:00
Characteristics of effective Group Leaders (Corey,2012) 

00:17:00
Emotional presence Sincerity and Authenticity 

00:17:00
Self-Confidence Sense of identity 

00:17:00
Courage Belief in group process 

00:17:00
Self-awareness Enthusiasm and Creativity 

00:17:00
PATRICIA ROBEY It's just so critically important that self confidence, courage… like I said, you can't be afraid if you're in front of a group. Your own self-awareness, in fact, the recommendation is that group leaders should have not only have classes in group leadership and go to conferences, but also participation in groups so that you can feel what it's like to be on the receiving end. And especially, if you want to adapt some techniques to be able to learn how to use those in your own experience and then put them forward. And sincerity, authenticity, a sense of identity, knowing who you are, the belief in the process itself… I remember in the same training group I was just telling you about at the beginning, at the lunch time on that day of that training on the first day, I went upstairs and I said, "Okay, what I know I need to do now is to trust in the process, know what I know and be sure I'm addressing the clients' wants." So that was the biggest thing in terms in making the group process move forward. Trust in that group process. 

00:18:00
SHANNON DERMER Trust in the group process. But there also are skills that you already talked about as a leader of a group. I mean sometimes they are managing skills like in the screening process, choosing people and things like that. But there's also leadership skills. Are there times where you as a leader step in and interrupt that group process in a very structured or forceful way? When would be times where you got to, time out, you know, rather than just trusting the process of the group? 

00:18:35
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, the function of a leader changes depending on what the group needs. And it also changes depending on the needs of the group and the stages of the group because beginning stages of a group need things that are different than the ending stages. But there are times when the safety of the group might be in question. That's a time for sure when a group leader needs to step in. But also if things aren't working, you don't want to just let them keep going down the path that they're going on. And that is a time when I would be more assertive as the group leader and I might even say, "Let's do a time out right now and just stop and let's just think what's happening in our group." And this is again where there's that poll from the group. And if there's not safety in the group yet, which is often an issue, I might do like a pair and share or get into smaller groups and have a discussion about what do you think is happening in our group because… 

00:19:35
SHANNON DERMER A pair and share, you have them pair off and do smaller group with larger…? 

00:19:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, or just, turn to the person next to you and talk about what do you think is happening in our group right now. Or I could have three or four people get together. The reason I would do that is because if there isn't safety in the group, it's likely that the group members won't just step up and stay, "Well, I think it's because this." But what's easier to say, well, in our group what we talked about was and then it opens up the opportunity for more learning from our group process and maybe for self-correction. 

00:20:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So there is, and then you talked about the connection between the family systems in some way. So there's a larger group, but you can also use subgroups even within a group process to help the process. 

00:20:25
PATRICIA ROBEY And that's the part of technique. It's also things you want to think about from your own theoretical point of view. There are things that you would want to do because you look at the group through your theoretical lens. And that also tells you what needs to happen in a group and what time. So, so you have some freedom. It doesn't have to be cut and dry because it goes back to one of the characteristics of a group leader… creativity 

00:20:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:20:50
PATRICIA ROBEY Being able to be experiential and know and be flexible within the process so that the group can get what it needs. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER You're going to do a vignette, do you want to just tell us real quickly about what that vignette is going to be about? 

00:21:05
PATRICIA ROBEY I'm going to be working with a counselor in training. And she is new to running groups, but she's in the practicum level, not just a peer counseling group. And I'm running into a little bit of a problem. So we're going to talk about that process with her… exactly what's going on with her as a leader, what's going on with the group and try to figure out some direction that she might take that fits her style as well as what do theoretically or from the textbooks might say you should do because that's an important thing to do things the way that meets who you are. 

00:21:40
SHANNON DERMER Great. I look forward to watching that and then getting back together with you and kind of discussing what you and the counselor in training demonstrated. 

00:21:50
PATRICIA ROBEY All right. 

00:21:50
SHANNON DERMER Thank you. 

00:21:55
GROUP WORK:

DEALING WITH PROBLEMS IN A GROUP 

00:21:55
SUPERVISION SESSION 

00:21:55
with Patricia Robey, Ed.D. 

00:21:55
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:22:00
PATRICIA ROBEY So, hi, Jahaan. It's so good to see you again. So you're here for our supervision, for our group practicum class. How are you doing? 

00:22:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I'm okay, I'm okay. I have a little throat soreness going on and a little laryngitis. 

00:22:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Are you okay for having our session as usual? 

00:22:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:22:25
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. That's good. If you need to have some water or whatever, please be sure and take care of yourself while we're talking. 

00:22:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Thank you very much. 

00:22:30
PATRICIA ROBEY So here we are for our supervision. So often you rush in and hear, really just hit the road in running. But I'd like you to take a minute and just kind of shift your mental gears and your physiological gears and take a breath and then blow it off and then kind of transition into being together and doing a little bit different kind of work than you're used to doing. Sound okay? 

00:22:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Sounds okay. 

00:23:00
PATRICIA ROBEY And you're ready to rock and roll? 

00:23:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I am. 

00:23:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. So you're coming here today to talk about your groups. You've got a lot of them going. So which one would you like to talk about specifically today? 

00:23:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Well, I have a group that I'm running. Some members of the group are there because they actually want to be there and some are in the group because they're mandated to be there or adjudicated to be there. 

00:23:25
PATRICIA ROBEY There's always an interesting mix. 

00:23:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. So some of the concerns that I have are that some seem to be very interested in being in a group and others are not. And I'd like to figure out a way that I can get all of them to be a little bit more interested, particularity the ones that are mandated to be there. There are students that are… I'm sorry, there are people who are a part of the group that are on their telephone and holding private conversations and I'm having a difficult time trying to get them to refocus. 

00:24:05
PATRICIA ROBEY That technology aspect is really challenging these days isn't it? It's almost as if we can't resist finding out what's on the phone. So tell me a little bit about the group itself. What's the purpose of the group? How did you screen the members? 

00:24:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It's an anger management group and like I said, some of them are mandated to be there and some have chosen to come on their own. The dynamics of the people who are in the group are all varied. And the ones that obviously come from… by choice are coming from the community and they're more invested in the process. They want to do something about this, that's either going… a problem within their relationship, their romantic relationships or their familial relationships. And the ones that have been adjudicated there come because they have had some kind of outburst. One of the members of the group had a… he went off on a tyrant at work and through the EAP program, he is required to come and in order to keep his job. This is one of the members that I'm having a really difficult time with because he's mandated to be there, but doesn't really feel like he has any problems or needs to be there. 

00:25:40
PATRICIA ROBEY And sometimes it takes just one person to throw the whole group off. 

00:25:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Right. 

00:25:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Is that your experience of it? 

00:25:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It is. If there's a couple of them that are… 

00:25:45
PATRICIA ROBEY Also in this mandated group? 

00:25:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. 

00:25:50
PATRICIA ROBEY So what session are you in? 

00:25:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH We are at Session six and we have four to six sessions left to go. 

00:26:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. So it's a time limited group. 

00:26:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:26:10
PATRICIA ROBEY And you're about a little bit more than half way? 

00:26:10
JAHAAN R.ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:26:15
PATRICIA ROBEY And so the group itself, is it a task group, educational groups, support group, what's your attention? 

00:26:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It's served as a support group and a teaching group so that they can learn better coping skills… coping skills that will allow for them to not have to come back into a session like this. 

00:26:40
PATRICIA ROBEY So I'd like to talk to you about a couple of different things. Number 1 is for yourself as the group leader what's happening for you in response to this group and then also looking at the group kind of conceptually. 

00:26:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:26:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Would that be helpful for you? 

00:26:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It would. 

00:26:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Okay. So where would you like to start, with conceptualizing the group or talking about your own perception and feelings about the group leadership? 

00:27:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I think that we can start with the conceptualization and then move in where I need to be. 

00:27:10
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. That might actually shift where you are so. So how do you understand the group? 

00:27:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Well, umm… maybe I'm having some difficulties in understanding the group because the two ring leaders if you will continue to throw me off the people that are there that want to actually be there and participate. They are in the stage of change, the stage to change that is, they're receptive to changing. They're receptive, they're receptive and open to moving to a better place. And they seem to enjoy the dynamics of the group. And they're feeding off one another other and you can see that they are becoming disconnected because the people who are participating in the group that don't really want to be there are kind of taking over. Their attitude is almost becoming insidious. 

00:28:25
PATRICIA ROBEY So as you're describing this, what I'm picturing is almost like you have two groups. You have the one group that's motivated in moving forward, a subgroup and a coalition and another group, would you say just one other group or would you say there's more than 2 groups even? 

00:28:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I would say primarily that there are two groups. If I had to say, there are probably three. There's the group that wants to move forward. There's the group that's mandated there and then there's two members of the group that they're there because they want to be there, but they're feeding more off of the negative people who are participating in the group. So if they want to feel cool, if they want to feel like they are being accepted that they want to feel like they're making friends, they tend to hang around with the people more that are not doing what they should… the emotional work for the group. 

00:29:25
PATRICIA ROBEY When you thought about bring this group into supervision today, what did you hope you would get that's going to help you when you leave? 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I was hoping that… well, restate the question for me. 

00:29:45
PATRICIA ROBEY So when you came in to, and you want to talk about this group specifically to me, and I imagine, you hoped to have something when you're leaving. So what did you hope to get from me that's going to be helpful for you when you're leaving, hence doing your next group? 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Perhaps some skills on how to, A, manage the group that is being mandated to be there because often in this, process I have seen people who are mandated to be in this and I know that this won't be the last time that I'm faced with this. But I would also like some skills on how to bring everybody together in the group and have them to feel like they're functioning together appropriately as a group. 

00:30:40
PATRICIA ROBEY I'm really happy to hear you say that because I think right there is where you're on to something. So what you probably remember about group process is that there's pre-group formation, then you probably screened your group or maybe you didn't because you were… this people just came in. but the first stage is establishing a group involves what? 

00:31:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH In establishing a group? 

00:31:10
PATRICIA ROBEY In getting the group started. So what needs to happen in that initial stage of the group process? 

00:31:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Well, I'm evaluating, I'm evaluating to see if these people work well in a group together. Before you form a group, you have to see if the people can work well together. You want to make sure that everybody is, not necessarily suffering from the same issue, but that they will all benefit from the group and the goal that is set for the group. 

00:31:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Did you have a chance to do that? It sounds like the group was kind of thrust upon you as opposed to… that you were able to choose these members? 

00:31:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I didn't get a chance to do it the way that I would have like to because some of them are mandated to be there. 

00:31:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Right. So that piece, we don't have any control over. But in the forming the stage of the group, so the group is in there and the leader has some responsibilities to the group in that initial stage. And what you were just talking about before was you want to try and get the group to be a little bit more cohesive, right? 

00:32:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Right. 

00:32:15
PATRICIA ROBEY So what have you done as the leader to try to get them connected? 

00:32:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I initially started out by encouraging them to listen to one another and their stories so that they could hear some of their own stories and how they're similar to other people and how they, how they are alike so that they don't feel so alone in the process, so that they don't feel like it's something necessarily wrong with them, but to also see that there's a better way of dealing with things that may be… it would be better to hear it from other people who are going through the same process. 

00:33:00
PATRICIA ROBEY And how did the group respond to that? 

00:33:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Most of them were receptive. Umm… Some of them were not, some of the ones that were mandated to be there were not as receptive and that has been a problem throughout the group process. 

00:33:20
PATRICIA ROBEY So would you say… and that kind of a normal thing. We've got all sorts of different levels of motivation in any group, right. And so as you continued on, how did your role change if at all from week to week? 

00:33:35
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Well, it has gone from what I felt like as the facilitator in the beginning to more of a mediator, more of a… you need to stop what you're doing and listen and I need you to refocus and doing a lot of that. And it takes away from working with people on skills to deal with their anger. 

00:34:05
PATRICIA ROBEY So you're not particularly happy with playing that role? 

00:34:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH No. 

00:34:10
PATRICIA ROBEY If you were your ideal self in this group, what would you like to be doing right now with where the group is at? 

00:34:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I would like to be doing more facilitating. I would like to be doing more helping, talking about skills, talking about good coping skills as opposed to bad coping skills and identifying the bad coping skills instead of feeling more like I'm an overseer. 

00:34:40
PATRICIA ROBEY So it seems to me that the group is in a little bit of a conflict transitional phase. But they haven't really done the business of connecting as a group from… kind of forming stage. Would you say that would be true? 

00:35:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. 

00:35:00
PATRICIA ROBEY And I'm wondering about again the motivation because it sounds to me like the group isn't on board with your intention. Is that true? 

00:35:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. 

00:35:15
PATRICIA ROBEY So given that and knowing that the initial stage of the group is to build relationships and safety and that kind of thing, I'm wondering if you, if the group would benefit if you as the leader kind of stepped back and went back a little bit to more of that initial building and forming stage by identifying group wants. And what I'm really thinking is that even the mandated clients are there because they want something. And so to identify what that is might give you kind of a backdoor way in bringing the group together. Does that make sense to you as I'm saying that? 

00:35:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:35:55
PATRICIA ROBEY So how are you hearing that? 

00:36:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH That I should take myself out of an overseeing role and almost like modeling… modeling in the direction that I would like for them to move in, not necessarily… as I'm not a member of the group, but not treating them in a way that continues to get them the negative attention that they're seeking. 

00:36:35
PATRICIA ROBEY So how would you go about that? 

00:36:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Well, I would go about it the way that you have suggested. Go back to facilitating more, be more inclusive. Not necessarily more inclusive, but have them to… remind them to join the group, remind them of the group goals and ask them questions like how does this help or move towards the goal of the entire group and have them to talk about those things. 

00:37:10
PATRICIA ROBEY And I think that's a key piece because like we talked about, you have at least two groups, it maybe three groups that are all operating separately while you're trying to manage them. And what you really want is for the group to become an entity within itself, not just a bunch of members and so to be able to work together and get the real benefit of the group. Would that be true? 

00:37:35
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:37:35
PATRICIA ROBEY And so as you're thinking about going back and maybe working more from the relationship reforming, how, how do you feel about that? What's your energy like around doing that? 

00:37:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I'm having some anxiety because I'm not sure if would work. umm… But I feel like I'm hopeful in trying that. 

00:38:00
PATRICIA ROBEY If you're having some anxiety, I wonder if there's something that you would like to talk about that will help to relieve that anxiety. 

00:38:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. I don't want to say that I don't know that that will work. What I do feel is that maybe they won't listen to me because if they were going to listen to me then, they would have listened to me already. Maybe they would have been more receptive to that already. 

00:38:40
PATRICIA ROBEY That could be true. And it could be true that a different message might get a different result. So it sounds like the message that you're thinking about putting forward to them now is a little bit different than the initial message or maybe it should be a little bit different, a way to draw from them? 

00:39:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH And I think that some of my anxiety comes from maybe I'm not doing something and trusting myself in changing the direction. 

00:39:10
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. So what do you know about yourself that will help you understand your strengths and give you the courage to step forward with managing this group? 

00:39:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I know that I am… I feel like I'm a good facilitator, an adequate one. I've questioned that through the process. But I know that my strength is communicating with people and having a strong desire to help people. So I attribute that to a strength because I've really want to be there and I don't feel like I just want to walk away and say forget it. So I count that as a strength. 

00:40:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. So I wonder if you can harness those strengths as you go into the group the next time and face the challenge of trying something different. 

00:40:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I can. 

00:40:20
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. And what's the worst that could happen? 

00:40:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH That's a good question. They all walk out and say, forget it. But they could have done that too already. 

00:40:30
PATRICIA ROBEY That's true. And they keep coming. Isn't that interesting to think of? So that's the worst that can happen. And if that happens, you'll come back next week and would add some more, find you a new group? 

00:40:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:40:45
PATRICIA ROBEY So either way, I mean you know that you have the strengths. It is a daunting thing to try and work with groups that are like your group. But in my experience, it's been… if I find that things are not going very well I have to think about where is the relationship with the members, is there safety? A little bit of conflict is a normal thing in a group as they get to the working stage as you know. But if they're all separated, that's not getting you much of any place. The other thing I would suggest to you is you can use the group, okay. So you could say to the group what I'd like you to do is to mix it up and pair and talk to each other in small groups and talk about where is the group, what would you like to see the group happen. And that way, they can talk amongst themselves, get some ideas and sometimes it's easier to talk from our group said, rather than I feel. And so that might also be a way to make new relationships, connect the group get different information from you… for you, but using the group to solve the group problem. How does that sound? 

00:41:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH That sounds great. 

00:41:55
PATRICIA ROBEY You have kind of a big smile when you're saying that. 

00:42:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH That sounds great. 

00:42:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah. What's your energy about that right now? 

00:42:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Hopeful. 

00:42:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, yeah. So you know you've got the strengths. You've got some strategies about what you might try. The worst that can happen is they'll leave, but they haven't left so far. So the odds are your group will maintain. And the best thing that could happen? 

00:42:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Is that they get new and better copings skills. 

00:42:25
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, you know… and it's probably all part of their learning process in the end and yours as well. So we only have a minute or so left. But as you're leaving, I guess I would say my wish to you is to remember those things that you know about yourself and you know you can always come back and see me every week, right, for supervision and we'll see how it goes. And your other groups are going great, right? It's just this one group that is probably the group you need. You know, how they we say, you get what you need when you're in practicum. 

00:42:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes, this is the one that's challenge. 

00:43:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Yeah, this is the one that's providing that foundation for you and how great to be able to do it here while you're in training rather than have to face that first kind of group when you're out there in internship or in your own practice? Okay. 

00:43:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Thank you very much for your help. 

00:43:15
PATRICIA ROBEY You're very welcome. I can't wait till next week to see how things go. 

00:43:20
GROUP WORK: 

00:43:20
DEALING WITH PROBLEMS IN A GROUP 

00:43:20
WRAP-UP 

00:43:20
with Patricia Robey, Ed.D. 

00:43:20
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:43:25
SHANNON DERMER Dr. Robey, thank you for doing that vignette with the counselor in training. Of course groups as we're talking about are complicated, but even more complicated if you have the mix of like people who volunteer themselves versus people who are required or mandated to attend a group. What would you like to point out from that supervision session? 

00:43:50
PATRICIA ROBEY I think that it goes back to support what Kottler said about a group being a lot of chaos and certainly you could hear that. I think that in this session what really comes to light is that it's a very complicated thing to work with a group, especially when you're in training. And there's many different things to consider and a counselor in training had a real challenge because of the combination of voluntary and mandated clients for an anger management group. And… I mean, that's pretty sticky. And so, for that to be a training group and psycho-educational too, so to get buy-in from the members for a group that they are feeling forced to do is pretty difficult. So I think what that demonstrated was, Number 1, how you have to have somebody process through, even if it's yourself, myself if I were leading that group, I'd have to think about what do I understand about what's going on. And this is again where a theory comes into play. From my choice theory perspective, I know that relationships have to come first. And if you don't have a working relationship and find out what people want to have happen in the group, you really kind of jump ahead too fast. And that was kind of my sense of what was going along with that group. That's what she was saying is that people came in for different reasons, different motivation. The people who knew what they wanted were moving forward fast and the others were resisting because they wanted something different. 

00:45:25
SHANNON DERMER I mean because that's a pretty complicated group. I mean, to just get a little content focused here and so just groups in general to have a mixture of, like you said volunteered and not volunteered, but also anger management is, pardon the pun, a volatile subject. But it is and there's different levels of anger management too that's such a difficult group to do anyways, especially if you have people at this end of the continuum and this end of the continuum. What would you say about the screening process then in a group like that? 

00:45:55
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, that's an interesting point. And in this case because Jahaan is a student, counselor in training, she wanted to do a group and the group was made for her. And in a sense, it might have been better of this was actually two separate groups because she has got some highly motivated people and then the mandated group. But ordinarily what you would want to do before you came in as she even alluded to this is to be able to screen the members, so that you know what's going on, that the members know what the expectations are, that they're a little bit more on board before you even start because members who come in cold, they've been told to go there or they don't know what's going on or what the purpose is of the group process or what are you trying to do to me, that does lead to group anxiety and group resistance. And that could be managed a little bit better if the group was pre-screened. And even it could be the same group. But to have also the relationship with the leader in advance might be a helpful thing in terms buy-in and group cohesion. 

00:47:05
SHANNON DERMER Would you then suggest that most group leaders do their own pre-screening of their clients? 

00:47:10
PATRICIA ROBEY That would be the ideal. And that's what's recommended in most of our textbooks. In the real world sometimes groups just form, especially when people need to run a group for training purposes and they're desperate to get anyone to come in. But ideally, the group should be screened and all those things to come to pass. And then it's another skill of a group leader to be able to tell somebody… sorry, not this group, but another one. So it's a whole another side-effect of the screening process. 

00:47:40
SHANNON DERMER Because in a lot of agencies, they have someone different do the intakes or screening, sometimes than the counselor. Do you think that makes a difference if it's the counselor versus an intake person who does the screening for groups? 

00:47:55
PATRICIA ROBEY It does in the sense of not frontloading the relationship. So, uh, But it's kind of a necessary evil in way in an agency. On the other hand, the side benefit might be that when the group all comes in and no one knows the leader, they're all kind of in the same playing field as is the leader. And so now, that group needs to figure out themselves as a group including the leader versus we know you, but not each other. So everything changes dynamics. That's what's fun about the groups. You know, as long as you can manage your own system when you have somebody just challenging as Jahaan's group. 

00:48:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. And what about group diversity, how much do you think there's an advantage to group conformity versus group diversity? Many different factors, you know, cultural factors, personalities, lots of different things. What do you think about group conformity or similarity, not conformity, and similarity versus diversity? 

00:49:00
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, my instinct is to say it would be easier when you have a group that's similar than different. On the other hand just like in a family, you can all be raised in the same family and still be totally different people with the same parents. uh, so umm… But yeah, I think that ideally if you had people coming together who were similarly motivated like a working group where if you had somebody in our university, for example, task force to look at English courses in evaluate them, then you've got people who are all together with a primary goal as opposed to a diverse group who would come in and we don't share the same values or beliefs or outcomes. So the type of group makes a difference too. 

00:49:50
SHANNON DERMER I guess that's true because some people say, Oh, it's better to have all women for a certain type of group or all men or all African American or all gay or all… instead of like mixed? 

00:50:05
PATRICIA ROBEY I think again, it depends on the purpose. But I think that one of the benefits of diversity is getting different feedback and learning new things about each other. And certainly that's something that we all could benefit from, learning to get along if that happens, but you never know. You just never know. And I think that's the thing is at this is why being a group leader is so challenging because there's so many dynamics that come into play, there's so many things you have to think about and be willing and prepared to step back to think about what's going on to address all the, and to get feedback to address all the concerns and get the feedback. 

00:50:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. And you've mentioned family systems when we talked earlier and I think that is one of the differences why groups I think in some ways are harder than when you're working with a family or couple. Again, there can be a lot of people in the room with you. But they do have some shared history, maybe some shared values, some shared goals. Or even if they don't have shared goals, you would expect that that would be one of the goals is to have them have some shared goals. And they can work outside of the counseling room together as well as inside the counseling room. So even though I think that there's a lot of stuff that goes on in, like family counseling, but it's still a whole different animal to do a group counseling. 

00:51:25
PATRICIA ROBEY It is for sure. And the animal is a zoo full of animals not just one animal. 

00:51:30
SHANNON DERMER True. Kind of like Noah's Ark, isn't it? 

00:51:30
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right. 

00:51:35
SHANNON DERMER How they keep them from eating each other, I don't know. 

00:51:35
PATRICIA ROBEY That's right 

00:51:35
SHANNON DERMER I mean it's the same thing in a group kind of how do you keep certain members from overtaking… you know, as you talked earlier, certain group members are just being left out because there is such diversity and not shared relationships, although they create a shared relationship over time. Do you have an example of a group maybe that you ran or you supervised where they really came together in the end and how that happen? 

00:52:05
PATRICIA ROBEY Yes. When I was in my internship, I was working with a women's support group and there was a woman who was really… kind of took over the, the group. And when you have somebody like that, you get the eye rolling and things like this. I was a co-leader because I was just learning. And I in particular was having really a difficult time with this person. And then I told my co-leader, I said I'm really struggling and she said, who does she remind you off and then that gave me some insight to my own process and also insight then into the client and into what did she need from her behavior. And so then we decided we needed to incorporate some techniques that were going to a limit the time that one person could monopolize the group. And so once we changed our techniques, changed what we were doing, used the group understanding, then we were able to make some changes. 

00:53:10
SHANNON DERMER So you were looking, I know that's part of your choice, you were looking at the purpose of the behavior and what needs that… that really fulfilled it and then that helped you as a group leader. And also we're just about out of time, but I did want to mention you also mentioned having a co-leader which we didn't talk a lot about. But that's also a nice way to deal with the chaos and also be able to take on different roles as to have a co-leader. 

00:53:35
PATRICIA ROBEY It is. I worked with co-leaders many times. I love doing that. One of my favorite examples is when I was a student here at the university and I'm a choice theory person and she was humanistic. And so the way that we operated off of each other, the things we noticed were different and it really led to a richness, not only of our learning, but also I think of the benefits to the group. 

00:54:00
SHANNON DERMER All right. So there's lots of ways. There's a lot of diversity in the way you handle and approach group. 

00:54:05
PATRICIA ROBEY That's very true. 

00:54:05
SHANNON DERMER Good. Well, I want to thank you today for sharing your expertise and for doing that vignette to demonstrate some of the issues. I want to thank all of you for joining us today for the CACREP series, the essential skills for counseling practice and I hope you all learned something like I did today. Thank you.
