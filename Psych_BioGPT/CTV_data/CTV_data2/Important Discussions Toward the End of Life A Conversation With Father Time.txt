LORRAINE HEDTKE Hello. My name is Lorraine Hedtke. I'm going to share with you just a few thoughts before you see the interview with Walt today. What you're about to see is actually a small part of a conversation that took place well over two hours. We have selected out the pieces that are examples of conversation that are helpful for persons in old age. 

00:00:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE The questions are intended to invite the client to speak in generative ways about life, even when other activities may have diminished or death is around the corner. While other therapeutic approaches might focus on an elder person winding down activities and new experiences slowing to a halt, a narrative counseling approach continues to see this time of life as vital, active and possessing opportunity for generative experiences and reflection.

A narrative counseling approach continues to see this time of life as vital, active and possessing opportunity for generative experiences and reflection. 

00:01:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE During my conversations with Walt, he told about many wonderful and creative stories of his life. For the purposes of this tape, however, you will only see a few examples from the stories that he told. During the initial parts of the conversation, Walt shared about growing up Jewish during World War II in Germany and what this meant to his family. He told details about how his parents' lives and their choice to stay together, even when that choice meant they were both sent to their death in a concentration camp. Walt recounts too about his difficult journey and the subsequent separation from his brother upon coming to America. Walt references places and times where his life changed dramatically from the young shy boy who feared anger and violence, into a gregarious and outgoing adult. 

00:02:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE  My assumption is that in the telling of these stories is an act of remembering. 

00:02:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE We assume that in the telling of these stories, in an act of re-membering. 

00:02:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE What I mean by that is that we are sifting through the events of Walt's life, where we chat and select out those elements that are critical to the story of Walt's identity and a story that Walt wants to affirm. Throughout the conversation, my thoughts were informed first that I desired to get to know Walt. I was hopeful that we could open space to talk about what it has meant for Walt to be older, to have suffered serious health crises, and to be facing death. But I wanted to take care to speak about this in ways that held meaning for him. 

00:03:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE I wanted to approach these areas using terminology and metaphors that would fit for him and affirm his life and his relationships. You will notice that the metaphor he uses for death is an encounter with Father Time. 

00:03:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE I wanted to use terminology and metaphors that affirm his life. His metaphor for death is an encounter with Father Time. 

00:03:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE I'm careful to use his metaphor and to not impose any other viewpoints under the guise of inviting him to face reality. When we can play with possibility, we open far more pathways to explore. In this fashion, we do not need to insist on a person accepting a shared reality or beating a harsh terminal diagnosis over a person as an imperative progression towards dying. While we're speaking about question formation, let me mention another aspect that I find to be helpful. 

00:03:45
articles about syntax and 

00:03:45
use of the subjunctive 

00:03:45
are on our website 

00:03:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE The way in which we use syntax is important when we create remembering questions. When we play with aspects of past and offering them as building blocks into a future membership, it can be helpful to form questions in the subjunctive form. Verbs like might, could, and may open into the space of possibility. It is the world of “as if,” where we can possibilize and shape what is most valuable and what is most useable before bringing story into concrete form. This stance allows us to speak about the meaning of death in ways that keeps the focus on vibrant life and on affirming relationships. As you'll listen to the tape, notice the work that the questions perform. I think you'll find this to be a refreshing way to keep a person's voice present, long after their physical voice is no longer present. My intent with remembering conversations is to use this reflective process with a present, as well as a future audience in mind. The stories that are told here have the immediate effect of being heard by those in the room, which in this case, includes Walt's wife and his niece. There is too an additional audience that time travels with us during the conversation. That is the people who are yet to see the tape. Since both Walt and I are conscious of the presence, as well as the future in this audience, it is always exerting an influence on what can be said. Through using questions that play with time in this way, remembering becomes both an act of past reflection, as well as of designing the future. 

00:05:30
remembering becomes an 

00:05:30
act of past reflection 

00:05:30
remembering can also 

00:05:30
design the future 

00:05:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE It is not only a conversation that features wistful reminiscing, but also involves a conscious envisaging a future alive with memory. Remembering conversations assumes a different position that I believe is more respectful. 

00:05:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Remembering holds the belief that our stories live in a membership club that we have been active in creating. 

00:05:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Remembering believes that our stories live in a "membership club" that we have been active in creating. 

00:05:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE  Rather than identity existing within an individual, membership affirms identity as living and is being produced in relationships. From this perspective, what we value, the stories of our lives and the moments of importance is accessible long after we are no longer physically here to tell or re-tell them. 

00:06:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Membership affirms that identity lives and is produced in relationship the stories and important moments of our lives is accessible long after we are no longer physically here to or re-tell them. 

00:06:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE The other concept I wish to underscore for remembering conversations is that of membership. 

00:06:20
Concept of "membership" 

00:06:20
Barbara Myerhoff-1970s 

00:06:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE This concept of membership and thus of remembering is brought to light by the anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff in her work with elders in the Los Angeles area in the 1970s. 

00:06:30
"membership" used in 

00:06:30
therapy by Michael White 

00:06:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE The concept of membership was then picked up and mined for therapeutic value by Michael White. Both of their seminal work has greatly influenced the way in which I think and in the way in which I work. 

00:06:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE If we assume that a person's identity lives relationally, rather than within an individual, we are free to think of death differently. The members of our life, those that have traveled alongside of us now, and in the future, will continue to have our membered status available to them, even when we are no longer here physically. 

00:07:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE If identity lives relationally rather than in an individual we are free to think of death differently. The members of our life will continue to have membered status available to them. Even when we are no longer here physically. 

00:07:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE When I interview people, I am most interested to learn about the membership club of their lives. I want to know about who has been the various members that have shaped a person's experiences and their stories, and I want to know who will continue to be the members that will be the beneficiaries of a person's membership after they are no longer here physically. Walt and I create a legend to the map of his membership club as we continue to speak about the many people who he has touched in his life. At one point, I inquire about the people who might have lost out, or they never had met him, as a way to bring into focus who has his membership card in their wallets. It is my hope that in making this video that Walt's generous ways will continue to inspire and to touch those who might never have had the opportunity to meet him. 

00:07:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE For you, the viewer, you too now can hold on to a piece of Walt, so that his membership can live on in your life as well. 

00:08:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE You the viewer, you too now can hold on to a piece of Walt so that his membership can live on in your life as well. 

00:08:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE And now the interview with Walt. 

00:08:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Jennifer had mentioned to me that you've had some health issues recently. 

00:08:10
WALT Yeah. For the last -- let's see, '98 was the first time, wasn't it, when I was in Belgium, we were traveling, and I have what is known as a TIA and Serah got me into the nearest hospital in Brussels and they said that I had a leaky heart valve that I have to have an operation. And I said, if all being the same, I'll go home and do it in the States. And the only good thing was that there was a confirmation of every test that they had done in Brussels, Kaiser did, and it came out. Then, I was -- I had open heart surgery with a mechanical valve, which I have. And I also have a pacemaker. That was in '98. Then, two years later, three years later, I lost a kidney. So I'm down to one kidney, which fortunately is working well. And last year, I had a gall bladder operation, I lost the gall bladder. 

00:09:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Wow. 

00:09:30
WALT So I don't have that much left. I still have… 

00:09:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE You're down to your vitals, eh? 

00:09:35
WALT I had hernia as already, but I do have an appendix that they can have. 

00:09:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE You're going to offer that? 

00:09:45
WALT And then this year, unfortunately, I couldn't swallow for a while and it was diagnosed as a tumor in the esophagus. And I underwent 28 treatments of radiation and four treatments of chemotherapy. And at the end of it I was -- I'm fine now. I can swallow, I can eat, I can do everything I did before. I try to walk everyday, but the weather is too inclement to walk everyday. But I do the best I can. And so, I'm optimistic. I mean, look, Father Time will beat me to it, but I'm still here. 

00:10:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE You're here. 

00:10:30
WALT  And all of this wouldn't have been possible without Serah, because she -- first of all, she took care of me, unselfishly. And the amazing thing about Serah is that she was never been -- she has never been sick. During all the times that I went through, she has never been sick. And this coming Tuesday is the first time that I can take care of her when she has cataract operation, which is a slight operation in the scheme of things. But this is the first time she has ever --. 

00:11:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Are you looking forward to that, Walt, taking care of her? 

00:11:15
WALT I always like to take care of her. 

00:11:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Tell me, if Father Time were to play out, and eventually you weren't here, where would you want people to remember about what you've done, because you've had amazing life experiences, haven't you? 

00:11:30
WALT I would say that the legacy that I leave is the memories of the good times we two had, with or without the family. The legacy that I have five grandsons that turned out to be just wonderful boys and -- because, accomplishments, I'm not a rocket scientist, I'm not an atomic researcher. So the only thing that the average person leaves behind is what he has created and not in the sense of giving birth, but created in persons that come after us. And if they remember me as a good grandfather and a good father, that's my reward. 

00:12:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE What do you want them to remember about your lecturing and about the life experiences you've had? 

00:12:30
WALT Well they feel that I've given up myself. One of the reasons that I did that, as well as I'm also tutoring English as a second language to adults, only when I got this tumor I had to stop it, but I want to get back into it. The main reason that I tutored and was involved in the holocaust is to keep my mind active, because I've seen so many people; they've reached a certain age and their mind atrophies. And to keep it going sure, I have music. As you see over there, I've got about 500 CDs. I have books. I have three bookshelves of books. If I live to be 150, I couldn't read them all. But I've bought them and there is fighting on the ship. 

00:13:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE And you'll get to them some day? 

00:13:25
WALT Yeah, some day I'll get to them. 

00:13:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, some day, right, I have those books, yeah. 

00:13:30
WALT Yeah. 

00:13:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE If Father Time were to play out and you weren't here physically, how would you want Serah to remember you as well, besides being a wonderful grandfather and --? 

00:13:45
WALT Well, I'd like her to think that I was her support over the years that neither one of us could realize a life without the other. And chances are that women live seven years longer than men. Therefore, since she is a kid, anyway, she will have a hard time without me, because who is going to warm her feet at night and who is going to listen to the horrible dreams that I have that she never remembers, and all the little things that we do together. And we are -- we are in a sense self-sufficient unto ourselves. Now, yes, we are involved with B'nai B'rith. I conduct a discussion group once a month on current events and I have friends in the B'nai B'rith. I'm also involved in the Jewish War Veterans, where my World War II comrades meet once a month. So I'm involved in it, but yet we do most things together. 

00:15:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Together. So if she were missing you, and you weren't here, what advice would you give her about that? 

00:15:10
WALT She's going to have to carry on. She knows that she once had a life for nine years without a man and she knows that her interests will turn to her family, to her daughter, who has undergone several operations now for cancer. And she'll -- she'll get involved with the family up to a certain point. What she will do, as far as physically is concerned, whether she stays in an apartment like this, or go into a residential home, hotel, whatever you want to call it... 

00:15:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:15:55
WALT ... that's something we've talked about. 

00:16:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:16:00
WALT We've also talked about the burial of what we would want to do. We both have a paper that gives us permission to pull the plug on each other… 

00:16:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:16:15
WALT …and not go through this horrible thing that the Scarabel family is going through. 

00:16:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, in Florida. Yeah, yeah. 

00:16:25
WALT So we are -- we are pretty much agreed on the what --. 

00:16:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE On those things. 

00:16:25
WALT  Yet, the reality, the stark reality that sets in at that point, I can't anticipate. 

00:16:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:16:35
WALT And, if God forbid, if she would leave before I do, I don't know what I would do. I really haven't thought it out. I'll probably end up in the same place that she would have ended up and --. 

00:16:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Really. 

00:16:50
WALT But who is going to take 500 CDs and about 300 books with them. 

00:17:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right, yeah. When you think about that and thinking also about your mother and your father, about how important it was for them to stay together --. 

00:17:10
WALT Yeah. I would say that at the time, in 1938, in Germany, where my mother decided no, I don't think it was that imperative. I think there was still hope. Though we could have gotten out, we could have gone to -- to Argentina. We could have gone to Paraguay. We could have gone to any place… 

00:17:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:17:35
WALT But the immediacy of the disaster wasn't upon us. When they were in the concentration camp, the values, the day-to-day life of clawing to another day is something I can't -- I can't visualize and I can't see what they were going through and what made my father do it, because he thought that life wasn't worthwhile without my mother, even though they did not live together, because men and women were separated. If he was a policeman, but he had a chance to see her. But they had reached a physical and mental condition where it didn't matter anymore. So you live or you die, what difference does it make? 

00:18:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Prior to that moment there were some moments of choice, where the -- I'm wondering if they chose, because they loved each other also. 

00:18:40
WALT Well, there's no doubt about it. There's no doubt. Well, she was destined to go, and he found out about it and said then, if she goes, I go. But I'm sure that in it was evaluation of the life and the quality of life that maybe this was still the only thing that he could lean upon, was seeing my mother everyday or once a week or whatever it was. But with her gone, what was left for him? And at that point, where you -- first of all, they were starved. They were skeletons when they were found by the Americans, or by the Russian army. The value -- the value of life was of little consequence. Sure, the instinct of survival always has been there. Otherwise they wouldn't have had any survivors at all. But I think at that point the purpose of his life was to at least keep in contact with his wife, and as long as they were both alive, there was hope. My grandmother had died long before, but there was hope. But once she was condemned to go the next day into the gas chamber, then there was no more hope. 

00:20:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE  How is hope a part of your life now? 

00:20:15
WALT  Well, the main hope is that I live a little longer. 

00:20:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, it's a good hope. 

00:20:25
WALT Because I'm going to be 80 in two months. 

00:20:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Is that right? You're going to be 80? 

00:20:25
WALT Yeah, I'll be 80, as my cousin well knows. And life becomes very valuable, because you want to hang on somehow. And I have cheated death certainly with the open heart surgery, and the things could have gone wrong with only one kidney and certainly with the tumor, which was found to be cancerous in the esophagus. But through -- and I would say that primarily I pulled through because of Serah. I can't visualize my living alone to go through all these things. I would have given up. I would have literally given up and I think that like -- who was it? O'Neill said, do not go gently into that night. And I will not go gently. They're going to have to drag me. 

00:21:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE They've got to drag you, yeah. I -- I would like to go kicking and screaming, because there's -- and part of that for me is, because there is so much richness here --. 

00:21:45
WALT And besides, I'm curious. 

00:21:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:45
WALT So I want to see what's happening. 

00:21:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE What's next? Very curious, yeah. So, many times when you tell me about these different things in your life, I'm very struck with how many, many, many times death has walked alongside of you, since you met Serah, certainly, but even from the get go, there has been so many times --. 

00:22:10
WALT Well, when I was born, and I still don't know, I have a scar here and I have a scar here. And my mother never told me what happened, except that she said, the doctor said if we operate he'll probably die. But if we don't operate, he'll certainly die. So she said, go and operate. And I think -- I don't know what they could have done on my neck. What they call this one a --. 

00:22:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Tracheostomy. 

00:22:35
WALT A tracheostomy, could have been. But I was a baby. And so, I was just an innocent bystander. Okay? Then I feel my escape from Germany was certainly one that was close. And when I got to New York, one day I went to Coney Island and I almost drowned and I was rescued by a lifeguard and ended up in the Coney Island Charity Ward. So I feel that that was an escape from death. And then I went into the service and they were shooting at me. You know, they didn't hit much, they -- here, here, you know, but I feel that that was a escape, in a sense. I cheated death. 

00:23:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Do you -- have you thought about this in your life about what this has meant for you, to keep cheating death? 

00:23:35
WALT Yes. I -- I was very proud that I was doing it, because I had run for a while. And I can't compare it with the longevity in my family, because I was a kid then, so I don't know how much -- how old the grandparents, but I do remember my grandfather died at the age of 63, which was nothing unusual. And my grandmother, my mother's mother, died at the age of 64, within a week of my grandfather, on my father's side. So it was nothing unusual for them to die, because for the most part, there was the heart and the fat around the heart, the arteries and so forth. They didn't have bypass operation. And when I think of what they could do with me, where they take the heart out and put it on a table and keep me going all this time, and I come out of there and I'm bloated and Serah told me, she never thought I'd survive it. I did. 

00:24:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE So, is that one of the things that people will tell one of the stories that your grandsons will tell, is well -- you had to cheat death? 

00:24:45
WALT I don't know if they're that much aware of it. I've never made an issue of it. I --. 

00:24:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Would you want them to know that now? 

00:24:55
WALT Not particularly. 

00:24:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Is there some skill in that? 

00:24:55
WALT  I don't think it's skill. It's Fatima faith. 

00:25:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. 

00:25:05
WALT Or whatever. I'm not a religious man and I don't believe in the individual god and so forth. But I can see where -- hanging on, you remember that my grandsons are anywheres from 25, down to 18. They've never known a life without me. So, they don't think much of that. Oh, yeah, grandpa is getting older, but I'm the same grandpa and I kid around with them and I -- I listen to them and one in particular, he calls me. I mean, I'm his grandpa… 

00:25:50
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:25:50
WALT And on his mother's side, there is no grandpa. So I'm the only grandpa. He does have two grandmas, but only one grandpa. And to them, there's no other life except grandpa. 

00:26:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE So if Father Time were to do -- Father Time does sometimes and --. 

00:26:10
WALT All the time. 

00:26:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE All the time, yeah. Unfortunately, it is all the time, isn't it? Yeah. And you weren't here in the same way you are now to be grandpa for this boy, where would he find grandpa after that? 

00:26:25
WALT I would say that the memory of me -- I've never given them anything, but good vibes. I don't think there was ever a conflict between any five of us. And they hold me in very high esteem. And I am very proud that they do. And I do my part in maintaining this esteem. So when I'm gone, they will have the memory. That's all that's left to any of us. 

00:26:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE And will that be the bridge? 

00:26:55
WALT Probably, to some extent, yes. They do remember where I come from. I'm the only one with an accent --. 

00:27:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE So they notice. 

00:27:05
WALT So that defines me -- defines me even more. And this is grandpa. And the same feeling about grandma. Now, the other grandma lives in Iowa and she comes up every two, three times a year. And it's not that intimacy with her that there is with Serah. But I think we're both held in very high esteem by all our grandchildren. And that to me is worth it. My -- my -- one of the things and I've meant to state that right of the bat. When I married Serah, I said right then, from now on the word “step” will never be used in this house. You are my son, you are my daughter. There is no stepdaughter. You are either part of me or you're not. And this has been -- and by the way, there is another boy. When I married number one, she had a son and then I brought him up from the age of nine, I guess -- two -- that's right, two for nine years. And he still looks at me in a way as his dad, even though he has a natural father. You see that picture there behind --. 

00:28:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, by the clock, yeah. 

00:28:35
WALT Yeah. Okay, I got involved in Big Brothers. That was another thing. Why? Because when Serah lost her husband, Paul was living in a household of nothing but women. There was Serah, there was Serah's mother who had to be there while Serah was working, and two sisters. And Paul had no guidance from any man. So he -- Serah saw to it that he joined the Jewish Big Brothers and he had a very good man, Norm Greenbaugh the friendship lasted well into their adult years. I don't know to what extent he is still in contact with him, but I'm sure of occasional phone calls. Well, here I was in the same situation. I had girls -- Paul was -- no, no. I volunteered because I felt that the Big Brothers system had been so beneficial to Paul that I volunteered. I ended up with a young man who was 12 at that time. His mother is a psychologist and still practices. His father died of a heart attack in his 50s or so -- early 50s. And he had two sisters. And so, when we met, his mother was very discerning about who would take her son, because she had turned down several of them. For some reason she took me. And so, he and I became little and big brother and we would go out together every other Saturday and we'd go to baseball games, we'd go just to lunch, to talk, to go to museums and so forth. And, he -- in a way I influenced him, there's no doubt about it. 

00:31:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE And what -- and what would he say? In what ways have you influenced him? 

00:31:00
WALT I think I gave him some paternal guidance that he didn't have at all. He is still in touch with me and every time he comes down to Los Angeles to see his mother, he stops right to see us and we talk to each other once in a while by phone or by email, and it's been a wonderful relationship for both, him and us. And naturally, he's become part of our family. So every time we had a party, David would be invited. He was -- became part of it. 

00:31:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Had you never made it out of Germany, had the twist of faith been different, then I'm wondering how many people would have lost out from not knowing you. You know, as you tell me these different stories, well, I think --. 

00:32:00
WALT Well, I probably would have developed the social life within. I think in Europe, it was much more delineated between Jewish and Christians, and so the circle would have been primarily -- first of all, I belong to a family that I didn't even know my grandfather was one of seven. I think there were six boys and a blind woman. She was the only female. And I didn't know most of his -- my uncles. And so, for then I was too young and then when -- the Hitler time, again, I point out that 1933 I was eight-years-old. So I did not go into genealogy or learn to know -- I know -- all I know is one of my uncles owned the frame factory. So he had a very -- in those days they had these ornate frames, the gold and so forth, and we always had huge pictures hanging on the wall, because he kept on sending us frames. So we had to get the pictures for it. So we had every wall covered with pictures. 

00:33:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE By speaking to -- if I were to put in a room everybody that you have met and everyone whose lives you have influenced since that time, I would have to have a pretty big room. 

00:33:25
WALT Yes, I would say so. 

00:33:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:33:25
WALT  By the way, we also had an exchange student living with us for a year. 

00:33:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, so we have to put them in, right. 

00:33:35
WALT And not only them -- her, but also her whole family. 

00:33:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. 

00:33:40
WALT She was from Denmark. You met Benoit, didn't you? Benoit came when Sandra was 16, by which time Paul had moved out and gotten married and Ilene had moved out. So Sandra was alone. And so, we got a Danish girl who came to us, went to high school and naturally it was a joke for her, because they are so much advanced in Europe over our school system. And she lived with us for a whole year and she went home and we went to Denmark to visit with her and her family and meet the -- the sister and her brother. And then, later on, she -- excuse me -- she got married and she had two wonderful children. And they came to visit us here. And she writes the most beautiful letters to us. She still calls us mom and dad. 

00:34:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE So we would put her and her children in this -- in this imaginary room, yeah. Let me ask -- I just have a couple more specific questions, is that okay? Thinking about -- if people were to see this tape, if the tape -- Jennifer were to kind of select out some of the pieces of the tape about your life, what would you hope that people who watch this tape would -- that they would get from it about Walt? 

00:35:15
WALT That for the -- certainly the last -- well, let's say -- let's divide my life into two sections, the European, the German experience of persecution and so forth, and the resulting fear of everything and loneliness in this town. I was lonely in this town, because I didn't know any people. And then I married Serah and things have changed and I would say that whatever benefit I got, I got through her and with her and this is what I would like people to remember me by is, as a nice guy. 

00:36:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE A nice guy with a love story. 

00:36:05
WALT With a love story. 

00:36:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE With a love story. Okay. How has it been for you to talk with me? We've talked for a little while now, eh? 

00:36:10
WALT Yeah. Well, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it's not a matter of bothering me. 

00:36:15
LORRAINE HEDTKE Well, thank you. 

00:36:15
WALT  No, what I'm trying to say is that I'm perfectly willing to talk about my life, my experiences and they are unusual. I mean, most people don't go through what I went through. And I feel my life really started 37 years ago, which is more than half of my life was in a state of fear and persecution and loneliness. I would say that I was lonely even when I was married to my first wife. There was no real contact. For anything, I had more contact with her mother than I had with her. And --. 

00:37:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE And the second part of your life? 

00:37:05
WALT And the second part of my life started when I met Serah and it has been a good life, and very few fights. Arguments, yes, but fights, no. And naturally I've always been very much afraid of physical violence in that way, because that stems from the fear of living in Germany and being beaten up and so forth. And, we didn't have -- we never had -- I'm looking back at living with my children, I think Paul and I had one fight in all the years and that was over something stupid, but never had a fight with Ilene or Sandra or Job. 

00:38:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE How has it been while you and I've been talking to have Serah listening? 

00:38:10
WALT Oh, I think she -- she probably feels pretty good of what I said about her. But aside from that she probably has picked up certain little tidbits that she didn't know before. 

00:38:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Do you think that she might be giving you some advice there on how she wants to be taken care of after her cataract surgery? 

00:38:30
WALT No. 

00:38:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE No? 

00:38:30
WALT No, because it's not a serious thing and we both feel that it's not a serious thing. 

00:38:35
LORRAINE HEDTKE No, it's not. I meant -- because you were saying that you're going to -- you really look forward to looking after her. 

00:38:40
WALT No, the only thing is I feel so good taking her up. I'm driving her for a change, she doesn't drive me. I take her home for a change, and -- because she is still a little handicapped the first and second day, I can take care of things, even taking the garbage out. 

00:38:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. Those are -- I mean those are the nice things that we do for each other, I'd say, yeah. Okay. I wonder -- is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you want to talk about before we turn the tapes off today? 

00:39:10
WALT Yeah. Well, one of the things that Serah has always appreciated is -- is my exposing her to new things. Her husband was a very good man and I think Jennifer can confirm that; what a wonderful man he was and how he took care of his family during times when financial burdens were heavy and so forth, and it was a disaster when he finally succumbed. But when she and I got together, I don't know how often she had gone to an opera, how often she had gone to a symphony concert. This was new exposure. Then we talked about traveling. And at that time, we were primarily interested in traveling in Europe. I have shelves of books of photos in -- I think we once figured out we had been to – well, I had been to 30 countries and she probably had been to 25. We covered everything from Morocco to Egypt. The only place we haven't gone is to the Pacific area. We've gone to the Soviet Union at the time it was the Soviet Union. We have gone to little countries that you never heard of, like Andorra and Monaco and Liechtenstein, yeah, we went to everything. And everything to us was a new adventure. And we've gathered these adventures and the memories and it's -- at that time my brother was still working and he said, why do you go to all these places, it's costing a lot of money. He's much more financially frugal, I guess. I call him stingy, but she wouldn't let me. But anyway -- so he said, well, what are you getting out of it? I said, memories; memories that will last a lifetime. You don't know how often we talk about where we were in Spain or when we were in Italy and what we ate in France, and what we did in Holland and, you know, going down the line. And this is what kept our life interesting. Then we decided that it was time to see the United States and we particularly liked the South, and we traveled in every southern state. We were in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina. I mean, we covered them all. We also went to New England and we covered Canada, up and down the coast, Vermont, New Hampshire, we went to every state. The only states we didn't make was Oregon and Washington. For some reason, we've never gotten there. But we've covered just about everything else. And again, it's the memories of them. I mean, when you went to a restaurant where it was called Awful Arthur and they lived up to it. It was the worst food ever been eaten in my lifetime. 

00:42:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Isn't it funny thing to advertise, isn't it, how awful you are in order to bring business in, eh? 

00:43:00
WALT Awful Arthur. 

00:43:00
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. So, if you weren't here, those memories, how would they live on? 

00:43:05
WALT  What would we live on? 

00:43:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE How would your memories live on for Serah? 

00:43:10
WALT  Oh, I think she would remember me within the scope of what we traveled, where we were and what we did and we did some horrible foolish things, where we stuck our neck out, because we didn't know any better. But, we found ourselves in some weird things, when a guy took us out into the wilderness in Venice. In the middle of the night he took us out and it turned out all he wanted us to do was to go to UCLA and get him a degree, an honorary degree, so that his pay would go up. 

00:43:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE So you have all these quirky things --. 

00:43:55
WALT All we had -- and he was singing all night to her Zarra and he was singing Chattanooga Choo Choo. 

00:44:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right, right, right. 

00:44:10
WALT Oh, yeah, we had a fisherman in the middle of the night, four o'clock in the morning, he starts serenading her, because she was out on the balcony. So they appreciated her too. 

00:44:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, these stories, you still need to keep telling them. 

00:44:25
WALT Oh, yeah. 

00:44:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE Yeah, you still need to keep telling them. 

00:44:25
WALT We found -- naturally my aunt had gone back to -- not my aunt, she was really my second cousin, had gone back to Germany. We found her and her daughter -- her granddaughter came from Colombia, and so we established a family there. And as I said, Herefta, who was the lady that was… 

00:44:45
LORRAINE HEDTKE That saw you off. 

00:44:45
WALT …the last one to see -- see me off, we saw her every time and we brought her to the States and she stayed with us for a whole month. 

00:44:55
LORRAINE HEDTKE Family has been important to you --. 

00:45:00
WALT Yes. Yes, I would say that I was very family --oriented. Therefore, when I -- because I had no family of my own. My brother is -- yes, he is there, but he's not much a family. His daughters, you know, I've seen my niece maybe three times -- there isn't that close cohesion… 

00:45:20
LORRAINE HEDTKE But I think about that … 

00:45:25
WALT …in his family. 

00:45:25
LORRAINE HEDTKE …that room of all the people whose -- whose lives have been touched by Walt is really huge… 

00:45:30
WALT Oh, yes, it is huge. 

00:45:30
LORRAINE HEDTKE Family members, you know, family in the lose term of -- yeah. 

00:45:35
WALT Both families, and actually I inherited a tremendous family through Serah. 

00:45:40
LORRAINE HEDTKE Right. And then I see you built other places, where you didn't inherit, or bring into the marriage with Serah, you built in many other places, yeah. 

00:45:50
WALT Yeah. But when you just think of Serah's family, I mean, she -- her mother was one of five or -- five. Her oldest uncle lived to be 98. Her mother lived to be 86 and she was the youngest one to go. And so… 

00:46:10
LORRAINE HEDTKE Interesting. 

00:46:10
WALT …well we made a lot of friends going overseas. We once rescued a girl that was left in Venice without a dime and she was ordering from a menu and tried to figure out how she could get by with $0.75 or less. And I told the guy, give me the check, let her order what she wants. And as a result, we met her, we went on the lay -- on the -- on the Venetian Bay in the water and to this day we write to each other. Every Christmas I get a card. She is married, she has a daughter, is a brilliant daughter, is a lawyer, and you know, we all get older. But… 

00:47:05
LORRAINE HEDTKE But I have a sense that -- again, that room just continues to grow, right, larger and larger. 

00:47:10
WALT Well, I'll just say that both Serah and I, when it comes to people, we are somewhat gregarious. We like to reach out to people, because we feel that every new relationship is one that enriches us somehow. And naturally, there are also people that we avoid. Every time the phone rings and it's one of those people and she knows who I am talking about. I'll tell her, my God, tell her we're busy. As I said, my life has been in two or three chapters. Chapter one was my life in Germany. Chapter two was my army life, and then coming home, going to USC, graduating, getting to work, and which was very difficult at that time, 1949. And sort of floundering and then meeting what I thought was the great love of my life, which wasn't. And so that's the second part. And the third part has been the most enriching and the most satisfying and the most glorious part of my life, and that's with my darling wife.
