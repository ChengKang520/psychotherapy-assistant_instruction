The Evolution of Psychotherapy 

00:00:35
A Conference Humanization of Technique Erving Polster, Ph.D. 

00:00:55
ERVING POLSTER Camera. This is a remarkable experience. You have to all come up and try this sometime. Uh, we, we've begun because the camera has begun and now I'm ready, they say, and I, what I wanna do, I'm assuming you're still out there. 

00:01:25
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:01:25
ERVING POLSTER What I wanna do is talk only for a moment about the, uh, uh, interconnections between technology and humanity because I wanna spend most of the time working with at least one person, maybe that's all I have time for. Maybe we'll have time for two, I don't know. We only have a short period and I would like for us to have a discussion after each session on the question of how you saw the interface between humanity and technology. We in psychotherapy are commissioned to integrate two very problematic things, the technology of therapy which is supposed to be an improvement over ordinary conversation where the person's issues of difficulty are concerned. I'm not trying to say that therapy is better than ordinary conversation because it's not, but with respect to particular problem areas ordinary conversation hasn't done it for the people who come to us, so we have to get into the technological mode and there are so many aspects to that technology that you know I'm not going to go into now. But the basic thing is that the two are... when I was growing up there was a little game we played, trying to pat your head and rub your belly at the same time. Anybody try that? Well, I finally learned it. It took me a long time to learn it and I can't tell you exactly what made that transposition that I could do that and I also can't exactly tell you what makes the transposition toward being able [00:03;15]to be a human being in a technological situation. Now, when I talk about humanity in this connection I am not talking about, um, ordin, kindness, all of that's included. I'm talking about being a human being instead of only a technician and what that involves and what we have to transcend is certain technological things that make it difficult like, for example, the concept of transference makes it very difficult to just be an ordinary contact because we've already, um, promulgated this position of the meaning of everything being more important than the event itself. So that what we do together may not be as important as the meaning it has, or the microcosmic impact and so on. Very little then is taken at face value which immediately interferes with the human process. We have to restore that sense of the ordinary engagement while still retaining the sense of meaning and microcosm and this special kinds of, uh, of focus and intensity and intimacy and saying things that, uh, register strongly and all of the things that we tend to leave out of ordinary conversation. So in the process of doing that some of the key ingredients... there are other technological things which we have to... I think this is okay as long as I don't turn my head. Uh, there, there are ordinary things... oh, this is it okay now?(laughing) Wow. So, there are some things that I can say in just a couple of words that will help. And that is to be simply kind to a person the same way you would be if you met 'em on a bus, or if you met 'em, uh, in a hallway and they were talking to you. Uh, anywhere you meet somebody you're likely to be very kind to them if they haven't done anything bad to you. The only thing in therapy is how to be able to be naturally kind even when they may have done something bad to you. Humor makes a difference, common sense makes a difference, idiomatic language makes a difference. Uh, asking questions which persons, people don't ordinarily ask makes a difference. And so on. Anyway, what I'd like to do is to work with somebody now. I may be able to work with two people but I'm not sure. It depends on what happens, uh, I'll try to orient toward short sessions and try to work with two people. And I don't want to make a selection of who I work with but who would like to come work with me? If you do, if you do, you have to sign a release. Is there...yeah. 

00:06:25
[sil.] 

00:07:10
ERVING POLSTER Hi. What is your name? Delene(ph)? Delisa(ph). Yes. 

00:07:15
DELISA I like your hat. 

00:07:15
ERVING POLSTER You like my hat. Well. 

00:07:20
DELISA (inaudible ) 

00:07:21
ERVING POLSTER Okay Delisa. Here we are, alone at last. (laughing) 

00:07:30
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:07:35
ERVING POLSTER What would you like to work with? What would you like to begin with? 

00:07:40
DELISA Hmm, well, what I was thinking about, and it's something that I said to you before we started, um, I'm so nervous can I have a glass of water, hmm, is that I work with geriatrics and when I'm working with them, um, I have, there's so much feeling there. 

00:08:00
ERVING POLSTER Feeling there? Meaning where? 

00:08:00
DELISA Between the two of us. 

00:08:05
ERVING POLSTER Between the two of you? Yes. 

00:08:05
DELISA Um, and a lot of times the feeling seems to overcome us, or at least it, it does to a point that I'm empathizing so much with them and the unfairness of what they're in that it's hard for me to say to them, well, let's look on the bright side. 

00:08:30
ERVING POLSTER Uh-uh. Yeah. I assume not seeing the bright side. 

00:08:35
DELISA It's hard to see it because, um, you know, a lot of times they're in an environment that they're very de-humanized, in a long term care type environment. 

00:08:45
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:08:45
DELISA And they are very depressed and it's not fair. 

00:08:50
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:08:50
DELISA And I feel the sadness... 

00:08:55
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:08:55
DELISA ...that they have and I feel this fear that they have. 

00:09:00
ERVING POLSTER You feel their sadness and you feel their fear and apparently you feel your own. 

00:09:05
DELISA Yeah. I think it does. I think it brings it out in me and probably with the other people that I work with because there is a fear of us being that way as we get older. 

00:09:15
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. So in other words they have something immediate to be afraid of and your fear is futuristic. That there but for the grace of God, in fact, there inevitably go you. 

00:09:30
DELISA Mm-hmm. But what... 

00:09:30
ERVING POLSTER Now wait a minute. You can't pass over that. I said something big to you, you implied it but I felt like you passed over it like it's a part of you not quite registered that you're afraid for your future. I can feel your breath, the amplitude of your breath increasing now. 

00:09:55
DELISA Mm-hmm. 

00:09:55
ERVING POLSTER What's happening? 

00:10:00
DELISA I'm relating their fear of what is taking or, just, just then I got the feeling of I see that I may fear what is being taken away from me. 

00:10:10
ERVING POLSTER Uh. Would you care to say what you're referring to? Cuz, you understand I wouldn't know what you meant by that unless you tell me. 

00:10:20
DELISA Um, I too, um, just through the natural process of getting out on my own and, uh, experiencing the death of a parent, um... 

00:10:35
ERVING POLSTER The death of a parent? 

00:10:35
DELISA Of a parent, yes. 

00:10:35
ERVING POLSTER Whose? 

00:10:40
DELISA Mine. That, that I lost my home in that sense. 

00:10:40
ERVING POLSTER Did you really? Yes. And when did that happen? 

00:10:45
DELISA About eight years ago. 

00:10:45
ERVING POLSTER Eight years ago, uh. 

00:10:50
DELISA And so... 

00:10:50
ERVING POLSTER What are, what are you feeling now? 

00:10:50
DELISA What am I... 

00:10:55
ERVING POLSTER You have such, such deep feelings when I, which I feel you're about to pass over every chance you get. 

00:11:00
DELISA I have a lot of, of, of fears still in here. 

00:11:00
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes. But can you... do you care to tell me what you're afraid of or maybe you don't even know. 

00:11:10
DELISA I think that there is, um, there's a fear of what's next and I think that my coll, with the, uh, with the population that, that we see I think that they're afraid too of what's next. 

00:11:25
ERVING POLSTER Uh, well maybe. Maybe not. They may be afraid of what's actually happening rather than what's next. You don't know that. 

00:11:35
DELISA That's true. 

00:11:35
ERVING POLSTER But, maybe they're afraid of what's going to happen but be that as it may you're afraid of what's next. Mm, right? 

00:11:40
DELISA Yes. 

00:11:40
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes, uh. 

00:11:50
DELISA Um... 

00:11:50
ERVING POLSTER Do you mind talking about it or would you rather not? 

00:11:55
DELISA I don't mind talking about it, no. Um, I just don't know where to go next with this. 

00:12:05
ERVING POLSTER Okay. Well, look. Your parents died. For reasons I, you know, it, it's certainly understandable that you would have experienced a great loss. I don't know the details of it and I doubt that we're gonna be able to get at it in this short session but what I do know is what you've told me. Which is that somehow this was not only a loss for you, which I'm sure was a great loss, but in addition to that it was a, a foreteller of the future. 

00:12:45
DELISA That the loss was a foreteller... 

00:12:45
ERVING POLSTER A foreteller of your future. That this could happen to you. 

00:12:45
DELISA I don't, uh, as far as that's concerned I don't think I follow with that because I don't think that I'm afraid of death itself. 

00:13:00
ERVING POLSTER Oh really? What do you mean, of death itself? 

00:13:05
DELISA I've always joked and said, well, when we die we can all be fat and go to heaven and fly around and sing all day so... 

00:13:10
ERVING POLSTER Well, I'd like to hear how you do that. I haven't heard about that yet. 

00:13:15
DELISA Um, I think that more of my fear would just be, um, and it's the, it's the fear that I see so much with the, with the population that I work with, is just that fear of, of, um, of, of, losing the control. 

00:13:35
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Of their losing it or you losing it? 

00:13:40
DELISA As well. I see their fear of their losing it as well as my fear of, of my losing it. 

00:13:45
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Which would you rather talk about? Their fear of losing it, or yours? I'd be glad to go either way. But, it's unclear to me which way because you've spoken about both. I could imagine both are important to you but I don't know which way to go. 

00:14:05
DELISA Well, I'll talk about the, the fear of my losing it. 

00:14:05
ERVING POLSTER That's your preference, you know, it's not just because I've sort of fed this into your mind. 

00:14:10
DELISA No. I don't mind either way but if, if, since I can talk for myself and I can't talk for them I'll talk about my fear. 

00:14:20
ERVING POLSTER Well you can, you know, you have an empathy for them, you could talk about them. I don't want you to do anything because you surmise I would want you to. Although it is nice to be, have people do what you want them to do. (laughing) 

00:14:40
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:14:40
DELISA I'm not doing it because you asked me to do it. 

00:14:45
ERVING POLSTER All right. 

00:14:45
DELISA I'm doing it because I want to. 

00:14:45
ERVING POLSTER Which, which is, the most interesting part of it is, of the two that you want to talk about? Which one? Their fear of the future? Your fear of the future? 

00:14:55
DELISA I'll do my fear. 

00:14:55
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well, you wanna tell me about it? 

00:15:00
DELISA Hmm, uh, I think sometimes I'm afraid that I will not be able to provide for myself. 

00:15:10
ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. But I can feel your tears already, almost as though it's already happening. Your imagination has a great connection with the future reality. Almost like it's happening. 

00:15:25
DELISA Mm. I mean, I'm 28 years old... 

00:15:30
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:15:30
DELISA ...and I already have two masters' degrees... 

00:15:35
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:15:35
DELISA ...and, uh, three licenses... 

00:15:40
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:15:40
DELISA ...and I'm scared shitless that one day I won't have a job. (laughing) 

00:15:45
ERVING POLSTER Oh, so now we're talking about fear of not having a job. 

00:15:50
DELISA it's just this sense of providing for myself. 

00:15:50
ERVING POLSTER Well sure, of course. Wouldn't anybody. But that's a different thing. Now you're talking about the fear of not having a job. 

00:16:00
DELISA Well, I think I've done pretty good in insuring that at least there's something I'll be able to do. 

00:16:05
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but how many, how many licenses and how many degrees will it take now to die. 

00:16:10
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:16:15
DELISA None. (laughing) 

00:16:20
ERVING POLSTER (laughing) 

00:16:20
ERVING POLSTER Now, because, you know, I would like to hear about it if you... 

00:16:25
DELISA (laughing) 

00:16:25
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:16:25
ERVING POLSTER Isn't this black humor fun. 

00:16:35
DELISA Oh yeah, it's very fun. 

00:16:35
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Really, how do you like black humor? 

00:16:40
DELISA Hmm, I like sarcasm sometimes. I think it's easier, uh, for me to deal with things sarcastically. 

00:16:50
ERVING POLSTER You don't, you don't like my using the word black humor do you? Cuz you switched it very quickly into sarcasm which is a little different. It's, um, but you like sarcasm though. 

00:17:05
DELISA Sure. I think it's fine. 

00:17:05
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, uh-huh. Can you tell me anything about when you, when you're sarcastic? Are you ever sarcastic with these patients? 

00:17:15
DELISA No. I don't think I'm sarcastic with my patients. 

00:17:15
ERVING POLSTER No. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:20
DELISA Hmm, probably more in my real life. 

00:17:25
ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. 

00:17:25
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:17:25
ERVING POLSTER Oh, so you're real, there's your real life and your life with your patients, uh, well, yeah, what are my, uh, possibilities for receiving some of your sarcasm? 

00:17:40
DELISA I tend to be more sarcastic with people who know me better. 

00:17:45
ERVING POLSTER Oh. So the better I get to know you the more chances are... 

00:17:45
DELISA You bet ya. (laughing) 

00:17:50
ERVING POLSTER I like that. You bet ya. What are you feeling now? 

00:17:55
DELISA I'm feeling much more comfortable. 

00:17:55
ERVING POLSTER Yes. You've somehow included your sarcasm into your world even though, you know, you haven't really put it out but it's begun to be a reality. Sarcasm is a little different from your empathy isn't it. 

00:18:10
DELISA Hmm. 

00:18:10
ERVING POLSTER Wouldn't have to be. You know I'm most at home when I can be sarcastic. 

00:18:20
DELISA Behind sarcasm is, uh, safety in a sense that, or at least how I see it, maybe you can remove yourself a little bit more from the feeling. 

00:18:35
ERVING POLSTER Well, uh, maybe, maybe you do it that way. But I think of sarcasm as, um, I know you're gonna love me whatever I say to you and, uh, it's like a love bite. 

00:18:55
DELISA A love bite? 

00:18:55
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:18:55
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:19:00
DELISA I have to take that one back to Texas. 

00:19:00
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:19:00
ERVING POLSTER Okay. Now can you feel the feeling you have right now? 

00:19:10
DELISA Mm-hmm. 

00:19:10
ERVING POLSTER Okay. Now I want you to imagine one of these old people and see if you can speak to one of them from this feeling tone. What would you say to them? Can you imagine? 

00:19:25
DELISA So that, I, I, so that nurse was giving you a hard time this morning, uh? 

00:19:30
ERVING POLSTER Uh-uh. But you look a little uncomfortable about having said that. Certainly not as comfortable as when you were jazzing me a moment ago. 

00:19:45
DELISA I'm uncomfortable because even though I can say that I have, I have, um, a problem with my being that way towards that person. I do, in the sense of, of... 

00:20:05
ERVING POLSTER Well, you're talking about their being neglectful and cruel and things like that aren't you. 

00:20:10
DELISA Yes. 

00:20:10
ERVING POLSTER But is that what we're talking about? 

00:20:10
DELISA Well, I was trying to treat you as if you were one of my clients and that was the conversation. 

00:20:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay, I want you to think of one of your clients and think what you'd like to say to her or him. Think of anybody? 

00:20:30
DELISA Mm-hmm. 

00:20:30
ERVING POLSTER Okay. Can you tell me who it is? You don't have to use a real name if you don't want to but... 

00:20:35
DELISA I would call him Roy. 

00:20:40
ERVING POLSTER Roy. 

00:20:40
DELISA Mm-hmm. 

00:20:40
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay, and what would you like to say to Roy now, knowing that, uh, you're free to say whatever you want to say. 

00:20:50
DELISA Roy, I really think that it's unfair that your sons took your farm away from you that you lived on for 43 years with your wife. I think that, that that's just very unfair. 

00:21:00
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Now, you've probably said that to him. 

00:21:05
DELISA I don't think that... no, I haven't said that to him. 

00:21:10
ERVING POLSTER You haven't? 

00:21:10
DELISA No. 

00:21:10
ERVING POLSTER Oh. Why not? 

00:21:10
DELISA Hmm, because, um, Roy is very suicidal because of this and, um, and working with him, or at least the setting that I worked with him at before, because I was working for this, the long term care center that he was placed in, um, I did not, I didn't go into that because I was trying to help him just deal with that moment. Uh, do you understand what I'm trying to say? 

00:21:45
ERVING POLSTER Not, not really. 

00:21:50
DELISA In the sense of I was a, I think that, um, I think that that was very dangerous to go that, that matter with him. 

00:21:55
ERVING POLSTER Wh, what was dangerous to tell him? You thought it was unfair that his children took his farm away and... 

00:22:00
DELISA I think it was unfair because it, in the sense that he was fighting, he was fighting so hard with it that to go ahead and, and to, to say you're right, it's really horrible, that, that might have gone ahead and given him the permission that he wanted because, let me give you a little background first of all. Uh, Roy oftentimes would get his medications and he would save them up, um, when people weren't, weren't, uh, paying any attention and then what Roy would say is that he would flip a coin. Heads or tails as to whether to take all his medications at once and go ahead and end his life. And he was still trying to hang on for a reason to live. 

00:22:50
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:22:50
DELISA And, uh, I think that going in and saying, yeah, it really is that bad, may have taken him to a point that he might have been like, I won't flip the coin I'll just take 'em anyway. 

00:23:05
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. It's a, well, it's very rough when you feel like a persons life hangs on whether you say one thing or another. 

00:23:15
DELISA And with a lot of these people they're so fragile when they come to us... 

00:23:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:23:20
DELISA ...it, it is very difficult to get into the true feelings. 

00:23:25
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. But I understand that you're dealing with a very, very difficult situation and I don't have the answer that you haven't already thought about. But that's the job you've got. Right? 

00:23:40
DELISA Right. 

00:23:40
ERVING POLSTER You like it? 

00:23:40
DELISA Oh, I love it. I really do. 

00:23:45
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well then what's the problem if you love it? You think you're gonna cure them of old age and disease and children who don't treat them right and... 

00:24:00
DELISA I just, I think, uh, I probably just wanna do a good job. 

00:24:10
ERVING POLSTER And do you think you're doing a good job? 

00:24:10
DELISA I'm trying. 

00:24:10
ERVING POLSTER It's not what I asked you. 

00:24:15
DELISA Roy hasn't taken those pills yet. 

00:24:20
ERVING POLSTER It's still not what I asked you. Do people always fall for your evasions? Your, your charming evasions. 

00:24:30
DELISA Generally. 

00:24:30
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, but I... 

00:24:30
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:24:30
DELISA Thanks. 

00:24:40
ERVING POLSTER Okay, but this time they didn't and I'm still asking you, do you think you're doing a good job? 

00:24:40
DELISA You're a tough old bird, uh. (laughing) 

00:24:45
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:25:00
ERVING POLSTER You, you must feel very close to me now. (laughing) 

00:25:05
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:25:15
DELISA I'm doing a good job. 

00:25:15
ERVING POLSTER Why do you say it so reluctantly. I, you know, it's, I had this strange thought which I'm gonna throw out, it may not be right at all. That, uh, you think it would be vulgar to enjoy working with people who are miserable. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:40
DELISA Vulgar. Vulgar. 

00:25:50
ERVING POLSTER You could use other words. Anesthetic, not fitting, not fair, whatever words you would wanna use for it but somehow that there's some disconnection in your mind between the idea of you having a thrill of working with these people and really enjoying it when they are in such desperation and such misery. 

00:26:10
DELISA I see with what we're doing now and that that is a, a, psychiatric setting... 

00:26:15
ERVING POLSTER You're not gonna answer me are you? You're really not. If I, if I don't keep on you you're not gonna answer me. 

00:26:25
DELISA My fianc� would like you a lot. 

00:26:25
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:26:25
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. And what about you? 

00:26:35
DELISA Oh, I like you too. 

00:26:35
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, okay. 

00:26:35
DELISA Hmm, no, I, I don't like, I don't like working in a sense of, unless, I like to see the prog, the progression of them getting better and, and to see, as far, if, if I hear what you're asking me is do I like being in a setting where they're not going to get better, is that what you're asking or... 

00:26:55
ERVING POLSTER What I'm asking you, what I'm asking you is, you could think of this hypothetically, that you are working with profoundly sick people, old people, and you are enjoying every moment of your life working with them. How does that fit together? Is that fair? Is that acceptable? Would that be acceptable? That hypothetical prospect. 

00:27:30
DELISA I can accept that. 

00:27:30
ERVING POLSTER Well, can you say it. Can you try the words. These people are miserable and I enjoy every minute I'm with them. 

00:27:35
DELISA These people are miserable but I still enjoy the time that I'm with them. 

00:27:40
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. And how does it feel to say that? 

00:27:45
DELISA That feels fine. 

00:27:45
ERVING POLSTER Fine? I mean that is damning with fade to praise. 

00:27:55
DELISA that feels great because the sense of we're working together. 

00:28:00
ERVING POLSTER Yes. But you sound like you're giving some excuse for it. You can condone it because you're working together but I take that for granted, that you're working together, you wouldn't be enjoying it. 

00:28:15
DELISA I do think it's great working with them. 

00:28:15
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes. Tell me more about that. 

00:28:25
DELISA I have a sense of purpose when I get up and I go and I work with them. 

00:28:25
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Uh-huh. And, and what is the feeling that you have as you say that? 

00:28:35
DELISA Conviction. 

00:28:35
ERVING POLSTER Conviction? Why is it not manifest? You look like, you look like you're troubled. Sad. And it didn't seem like just empathy, it felt like you're saying something bad. I could be mistaken but that's how it looked to me. What is it that you do feel? 

00:29:10
DELISA At work? 

00:29:10
ERVING POLSTER Now. 

00:29:10
DELISA I feel flooded with emotion right now. 

00:29:15
ERVING POLSTER You feel flooded. I'd like to hear about your flooding. 

00:29:20
DELISA I've always said I'm a very emotional person and, and no matter what emotion it is, um, I feel it. 

00:29:35
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yes. And what is the emotion you're feeling now? 

00:29:40
DELISA Well, here's sure a lot in my stomach right now. And... 

00:29:45
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:29:45
DELISA ...I don't, I keep going back to fear. 

00:29:50
ERVING POLSTER You feel afraid now? 

00:29:50
DELISA That's the feeling that I feel. 

00:29:55
ERVING POLSTER Yes. There's something reflexive within you about this fear reaction in the face of no course for you to be afraid. I don't know where the reflex came from. I'm sure if we spend enough time with it we would discover that but at the very moment when you're expressing thrill, excitement, pleasure, having a great job of work, something you're devoted to, dedicated t and you start saying it you switch off from it and you become afraid and sad instead. Are you aware of that sequence? 

00:30:40
DELISA Not until you pointed that out. 

00:30:45
ERVING POLSTER But now that I have pointed it out? 

00:30:45
DELISA I think there's a fear in all of us. 

00:30:55
ERVING POLSTER What, we're gonna get philosophical now are we? 

00:30:55
DELISA I think, yeah, I'm looking at it in the sense of, again, and maybe it's because I'm very green. 

00:31:10
ERVING POLSTER You're very what? 

00:31:10
DELISA Green and young and... 

00:31:10
ERVING POLSTER Of course that's a part of it, of course. Well said. Well said. 

00:31:20
DELISA I always said I wanted to be perfect by the time I was 30. 

00:31:25
ERVING POLSTER My god, you're getting in a desperate position, you only got two years to go. What are you feeling now? 

00:31:40
DELISA I think that I'm feeling that it's okay to be afraid. 

00:31:45
ERVING POLSTER Uh, okay, that's very nice. I would also like to know, since we don't have a lot of time whether it's okay to be thrilled? Whether it's okay to be dedicated? Whether it's okay to wake up every day thinking you're doing something important to do? 

00:32:10
DELISA Thrill and dedication, yes. But I think that sometimes its afra... that, that I pull back from allowing myself to be satisfied. 

00:32:25
ERVING POLSTER Right. Well said. Could you say it again. 

00:32:35
DELISA I'm afraid to be satisfied. 

00:32:40
ERVING POLSTER Yes. And was that a satisfactory way of saying it? 

00:32:50
DELISA It felt good to say it. 

00:32:50
ERVING POLSTER You changed the words a little bit. Can you tell me you're satisfied with the way you said it. 

00:33:00
DELISA I'm satisfied with the way I said it. 

00:33:00
ERVING POLSTER Can you do it without shrugging your shoulders and turning your head around. 

00:33:05
DELISA I'm just animated. 

00:33:05
ERVING POLSTER What? 

00:33:05
DELISA I'm just animated. 

00:33:10
ERVING POLSTER No. Not true. You're preventing your animation, switching it into another area. Can you animate it though? Animatedly tell me of your satisfaction. 

00:33:25
DELISA I'm afraid to be satisfied. 

00:33:25
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. Now I'm gonna skip a lot of steps. I wouldn't normally expect you to suddenly get into accepting your satisfaction but see if you can pick out anything that has happened here in this session that you feel good about. 

00:33:50
DELISA I liked what you said and how I felt when you, when you, um, pointed out to how I would feel if I were in a situation with the clients that we were just working together, even though things were not good for them. 

00:34:15
ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh, yeah. You liked that. 

00:34:15
DELISA And that feeling of getting in there and really doing something. 

00:34:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Now, tat gets a little more to it. Okay now, you liked that. On a scale of one to ten how much did you like it? 

00:34:30
DELISA I liked that ten. 

00:34:30
ERVING POLSTER Ten. Hallelujah sister. Uh-huh. What are you feeling now? 

00:34:45
DELISA I feel like I let go of some of that fear. 

00:34:50
ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh. But it's hard to let go of the fear until you can reclaim the pleasure. You see, you let go of the fear and you don't have the pleasure, what's there? 

00:35:10
DELISA I think there's always an underlying thing in the back of my head because I, I did, um, I think I was satisfied at one point. 

00:35:20
ERVING POLSTER Uh-huh, yes. Yes, tell me. 

00:35:25
DELISA And that satisfaction was taken away. 

00:35:25
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:35:25
DELISA And I became afraid. 

00:35:30
ERVING POLSTER Yeah, and that touches you very deeply. 

00:35:35
DELISA It does because the sense of, you're afraid to feel satisfied because what if that's taken away again. 

00:35:45
ERVING POLSTER Yes. Yeah. Yes, well, if it's taken away again you'll suffer. Right? I'm wondering whether you think there's something magical about not being satisfied. That maybe if you're not satisfied nothing bad will happen. That's taking it another step. Do you understand what I'm saying? Like an evil eye. 

00:36:20
DELISA So safety? 

00:36:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. So you would have to discover that satisfaction is not what causes the trouble. 

00:36:30
DELISA Fear is what causes the trouble. 

00:36:35
ERVING POLSTER No. Trouble is what causes the trouble. There's nothing magical in either your fear or your pleasure. Trouble is trouble. Trouble is trouble is trouble is trouble is trouble is trouble. And you are you are you are you and you have the capacity for pleasure and it's not that capacity that will create the trouble. How do you like my sermon? 

00:37:05
DELISA It hits home. 

00:37:10
ERVING POLSTER Yes. It's sort of a shortcut to what I would like you to realize within yourself. Yes. What do you want to say to me? Could you say something to me beginning with the word you? 

00:37:30
DELISA Thanks. I keep worrying about my non-waterproof mascara but then I think at least you have on that hat. (laughing) 

00:37:35
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:37:55
ERVING POLSTER And let me, and let me tell you I'm 73 years old so I'm not young and that was just right. (laughing) 

00:38:00
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:38:05
DELISA Thank you. 

00:38:05
ERVING POLSTER Okay. 

00:38:10
AUDIENCE (applause) 

00:38:25
ERVING POLSTER Would anybody like to start the discussion about the session, either from the, any standpoint you want to, uh, in terms of the, uh, technology of it or in terms of what you observed in the interplay between humanity and technology. Anybody care to begin the discussion? 

00:38:45
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1 Hi. Uh, I wanted to know, were you working the polarizations of integrating the fear and pleasure with, the fear with the pleasure and satisfaction. 

00:39:00
ERVING POLSTER Well, that would be one way to put it and the, and ultimately that would be a good direction to go. But what was more, uh, manifest for me was the, the way in which the fear was being used to evade the pleasure and it wasn't until the end that I realized any of the magical quality about it of the... that somehow, if she gets totally absorbed and totally with it, that something terrible might come to happen. But the polarity would be very interesting to work with and see how they interrelate within because she does feel both fear and pleasure but they are, uh, they're not connected with each other. It's as though it's either one or the other. 

00:39:45
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2 Hi there. I think that was some great work what I was just observing and I wanted to tell you I was pleased to be able to be a part of that in the audience. I did have one comment, one observation that I noticed, um, from the young lady. I was observing whenever she would utilize her humor it was also a way of her being able to keep away from her feelings with the jokes about you, as humorous as they were, I should point out that it was a way of, from what I've noticed, from being 20, 25 feet away, of her being able to defocus from her own feelings by focusing on what's going on for you, as keeping away those inner struggles. 

00:40:25
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. Well that's a very interesting, uh, procedural, uh, point of view it, it's, I see it the other way. I don't see it as an evasion of feeling. I see it as that's the feeling that she is evading. That somehow the recovery of the okay-ness of that feeling in the face of the seeming incongruity of that feeling with the, uh, the parameters of her work, the implications of her work. That somehow she doesn't seem to get the idea that you could really have a tremendous time working in the most terrible situations. And we, as therapists, of course, it's our lives. If we think of our work as mere drudgery because the people we work with are unhappy then what we're doing is first of all, uh, diminishing our powers but second of all we're narrowing the people we're working with. Now it is true that when people are in the position... excuse me, I've forgotten your name... 

00:41:40
DELISA Delisa. 

00:41:40
ERVING POLSTER Selisa? Delisa, yes. Delisa, yes. Um, the, I've forgotten what I wanted to say. I got so entranced with the idea of Delisa, Delisa as being like delicious... 

00:42:05
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:42:05
ERVING POLSTER ...and I'm trying to understand, uh, how she could, how life would be like in her work. I'm not saying she can't do it else, elsewhere, if she could accept this deliciousness in the face of other people being destarved, being starved. Oh yeah, I remember now where I was talking about with relation to our patients. We, we undermine them if we think that the reason for their coming in to see us is the only thing that exists in their lives, and they will brainwash us to think so. Because they think that coming in to therapy is to slice, cut a slice, out of their lives which you will attend to and never bring in any exceptions to that experience. And the, a major therapeutic asset is the discovery that people are already doing what they need to do for the, uh, success of the therapy. People very often don't know what they're doing or what they have or what they feel. They squander experience and it's our job to try to help them pick up what they left behind. So like, with these people it may be that if she doesn't have any of this vibrancy she's not alive and I'm sure she can't prevent it. I'm sure she has it but there's someway which she may be interfering with it. They are then deprived of the vibrancy which their lives merit and the in-roads into the fact that it's still an accessibility within them. So, I'm not commenting on the particular people, how badly depressed they may be or how rigidified their minds may be. It may be a really terrible task to break through the experience but, in any case, in answer to the question, I don't think the humor was, was beside the point, I think the humor was an important part of the point. Any other questions? 

00:44:20
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3 Yes. 

00:44:20
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:44:20
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3 Uh, I have two parts to one question. Uh, could you put in your own words a description of the therapeutic movement that you saw in this session, and secondly could you speculate about what subsequent changes might occur as a result of this session, uh, changes she might initiate, uh, perhaps to paraphrase the second part of that, uh, how would you write a treatment plan. 

00:44:45
ERVING POLSTER (laughing) 

00:44:45
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3 Based on what happened here. 

00:44:45
ERVING POLSTER Okay. Small, small task, uh. Uh, well, the, the, what happened, as I said in the therapy session, the fundamental thing was her diminishment of her vibrancy because of what she sees as her failure. That somehow because of the failure she's not able to see that she' doing good and she can't get the supports from doing good. Secondly, she has some sense of being afraid, uh, afraid of her own future, which she tries to guard against, as we all do, by accomplishing things and getting the supports we need but perhaps not experiencing sufficiently that they really do indeed support her. That having two degrees and three licenses or whether it's the other way round, sounds like a full house either way. 

00:45:50
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:45:55
ERVING POLSTER That that should help reduce the chances that she's gonna become homeless and she has to register those accomplishments. Because as long as she doesn't register the accomplishments she doesn't have the supports that they should give her for, uh, be feeling good about what she's doing. The third thing was the way in which she fluffed things off when you faced her with a direct issue that centered on her pleasures and I think that was a key thing because then we got into the realm of what she then eventually came to say is that she somehow associates satisfaction with disaster, and that connection has to be undone. That satisfaction and disaster may be sequentially a part of her life, that she may be satisfied and then some disaster happens. It's not because of the satisfaction and it's not connected with the satisfaction. Now, why she feels that way would take a lot more exploring as to her experiences but I thought that was the key thing. So what I would see as a treatment plan would be to follow through on the suggestions, uh, one being that she accept her, um, um, what shall I call it, uh, her, her, um, liveliness. Her dedication. The positive aspects of what she puts into them as real and understand that it's very difficult for anybody to experience vibrancy in the face of failure. And that if what she'd see as success would be to cure these people of their diseases or to interfere with the death process then failure is very evident. She is dealing with dying people and she has to have some pleasure in whatever sufferance she can give them, whatever insights she can give them, whatever hope she can give them, whatever sense of one last relationship that will count for them that she can give them. And these are the... you have to find ways of, of your work when it is meaningful and, uh, and exciting. Some ways to, uh, to, uh, cash in on that. To build from what you have and the process you're likely also to build on what you, the people you're working with have. So, a treatment plan would be to include her sarcasm, include her, uh, her crying, not as a statement of fear but as a statement of empathy. To not expect that, uh, her crying is necessarily gonna cure her people but it will be part of the relationship and they may have whatever they can possibly get from her, will get in the relationship and that she can't expect to give them what's not there to be given. Okay, next question. 

00:49:10
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 I think that's me. Hmm, can you hear me? 

00:49:15
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:49:15
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 Okay. Hmm, I guess I was struck having just sat through your wife's session on supervision... 

00:49:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:49:20
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 ...that one of the things that she did there is what I also saw you do with her, was see these strengths in her very quickly that her sar, her empathy and her sarcasm were wonderful strengths and then I, and then I felt like, um, you try, you, somehow you selected going with sarcasm as opposed to empathy. Which made sense to me actually, um, and I, and I, well I guess I'd be interested in how you chose that but I'm also interested in that you not only tried to invite her, uh, to see this but invite her to do it to you and then even at the very last moment trying to let her hear your, your response of it which would also be those of the elderly that she works with, that it felt wonderful. 

00:50:10
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:50:10
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 It's so nice to be treated like a real human being who isn't fragile, but who is worth having a real relationship with. 

00:50:15
ERVING POLSTER That's right. 

00:50:15
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 That's such a talent that she has and I wasn't... 

00:50:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. 

00:50:20
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4 ...I thought you gave it to her right from yourself. That's the humanity in you as well as the other way. 

00:50:25
ERVING POLSTER Well, that's the hopefully microcosmic effect of the therapy session. That somehow... we usually think of transference as, uh, that we transfer some feelings from long ago to something that's happening now but inappropriately when you could also think of transference as something which you experience in therapy you can use elsewhere. 

00:50:55
AUDIENCE (applause) 

00:51:00
ERVING POLSTER And it, and one, one picture is worth a thousand words. So if she can, if she can get the feeling of her brightness and, uh, and incisiveness with her sarcasm with me being really fun, and knows that at 73 I hardly remember what it is like to be 28, it gives her a perspective on what's possible. Furthermore it's very tempting when you deal with problems to think that the solution to the problem is the solution to the problem. When actually, the solution to the problem is the discovery of those assets which one can bring to bear to the forth, solving the problem. You cannot solve a difficult problem by, by abandoning your strengths. That's what you use to build on. I'm told we have five more minutes. Okay. Another question? 

00:51:55
AUDIENCE MEMBER 5 I, I have a, another question on humor. But not her humor but yours. I'm thinking, in my own training whenever I got the connection or the emotion in the session there was a high emphasis on kind of a solemness or a not interfering and I think I would have, and probably was, slapped on the wrist a number of times if I used humor and I was fascinated with your ability to use humor, even at the moment when there was a deep connection and emotion and kind of a playfulness and being able to bring it right back to, to the connection. I wonder if you could comment on that? 

00:52:30
ERVING POLSTER It all stems from being able to pat your head and rub your belly. (laughing) 

00:52:35
AUDIENCE (laughing) 

00:52:40
ERVING POLSTER That's all it is. Uh, somehow we think that every, all these, these are dichotomous and we're, we're taught that and it, it takes a lot of experience. You see, I have to have enough experience to know that when I say something sarcastic to her or joke around when she's crying, I don't think I joked around when she was crying, maybe I did. But, uh, she still knows I'm with her and that has to be evident at all times and if you can't do it that way then you can come to do it that way. Because it's available to be done that way. Now obviously you, you sometimes make mistakes on that score, you have to be very selective about it and she gave me invitations to it. Something about the openness of hr face and the way she laughed and things like that. That said, hey, it's okay, don't take me too seriously in my tears. I am more than my tears, even though I would like to pretend that's all I am while I'm with you so that you can solve my problem. Cuz if you see me laugh you'll never care about my tears. But I'll care about her tears even if we laugh. 

00:53:55
AUDIENCE MEMBER 5 Well it was a beautiful thing to watch. It was a, it was a privilege, thanks. 

00:54:00
ERVING POLSTER Okay, yeah. 

00:54:00
AUDIENCE (applause) 

00:54:10
ERVING POLSTER Where are we? 

00:54:10
AUDIENCE MEMBER 6 Do we, do we have time for another question? 

00:54:10
ERVING POLSTER Two minutes. 

00:54:10
AUDIENCE MEMBER 6 Okay, I have a quick one. I wondered about, um, the intent of your last question. You said, with the, could you start a sentence with saying something about you yourself. I didn't understand what your intent was with that. 

00:54:20
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. I wanted her to feel the reality of me and her. And I, with just enough sense of her taking, skimming over the experience, some tendency to do that in some of her evasions that maybe one, I want to accentuate this really happened because very often the important thing is therapy is not only what happens but that they're happening register and there's a lot of stuff that happens in therapy that's beautifully, beautiful happenings that don't register and we don't have complete control to make them register but it, it's important to try. Look I wanna say one more thing about humor that I meant to say before and forgot. Humor is one of the things that's very personal. It's very hard to be abstractly humorous. It's easy to be abstractly somber. Somber for the universe but you're only funny with one person. Unless others are listening in. But it's a very personal experience. Okay, how do we stand now? 

00:55:30
AUDIENCE MEMBER 7 Do we have more time? 

00:55:35
ERVING POLSTER One minute. 

00:55:35
AUDIENCE MEMBER 7 I'll be quick. Uh, to go with your, uh, deliciousness metaphor I was noticing the really lively relish in the audience as we were listening to, at least for me, to Delisa's plight and, um, it, if, I was feeling a little bit guilty about that and I [??] if you could, since I think it's what you were, it's, it, I perceived your trying to get... 

00:55:55
ERVING POLSTER It's, it's crucial to what she was saying. 

00:56:00
AUDIENCE MEMBER 7 Exactly, that's my comment... 

00:56:00
ERVING POLSTER Yes. 

00:56:00
AUDIENCE MEMBER 7 ...whether it was directive identification parallel process it was trying, I perceived it was what you were trying to get across to her, that she couldn't enjoy her own getting in there. 

00:56:10
ERVING POLSTER Yeah. It's delicious work that we do. We are privileged to do this work, to be invited into people's hearts. The only thing I'd rather have done in my whole life if I'd had a choice of vocations would have been to be a major league ball player.
