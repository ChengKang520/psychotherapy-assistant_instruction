A ALEXANDER STREET PRESS HAWAII ACA2014 Conference & Expo ACA Counseling on Action Demonstration Series Empowering Youth Victimized by Cyber-bullying: A Solution Focused Adlerian Counseling Model Janet Froeschle Hicks Empowering Youth Victimized by Cyber-bullying: A Solution Focused Adlerian Counseling Model Janet Froeschle Hicks, PhD, LPC, CSC Client: Elizabeth Deming Texas Tech University Demonstration â–º Elizabeth is role playing a 15 year old high school girl who has been skipping school and her grades are falling. Her mother has brought her to see the counselor to determine how to help Elizabeth take her school work more seriously. 

00:00:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Let me give you just little, ah, background so you know what you'll be seeing here in a few minutes. This is Elizabeth and Elizabeth is a 15-year-old, ninth grade high school student. Elizabeth's mom has been in to see me, she has no idea what's going with Elizabeth except she brought home a report card with failing grades and this is a student who, previous to this, was on the math team and was making straight As in math and all of a sudden grades are not too good. Mom is extremely worried, has no idea what's going on but has been in pleading with me to try and do something to help Elizabeth. Hi, Elizabeth. Your mom came in to see me today and she seems very worried. You wanna tell me about that? 

00:01:10
ELIZABETH DEMING All right. I think she's kind of overreacting, she always does this. I don't know. She's just was really getting on to me about stuff. I brought home a report card that wasn't so great and so she kind of freak out. 

00:01:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you brought home a report card, mom's not very happy about the report card. I am very proud of you right now because it took a lot of courage for you to come in here and talk me with everything that's going on. Tell me a little bit more about what's going on at school. 

00:01:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I don't know. My-- I guess my grades are not that great but I really just don't like that math class. It-- I just don't like being in there and, uhm, it's just really, really frustrating being in there. Uhm, the kids aren't really nice and I don't-- I don't know, ninth grades is kinda-- it's a lot different than middle school. So, I'm just-- I just don't like being in that class. 

00:02:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you're having a really hard time with that class. Tell me about that class. 

00:02:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, there's, there's these girls that, ah, well, I used to be really, really good in math and on the first few days of school, you know, I'm good at it so I always raise my hand and stuff. But then other people realize I was good at it and they started kinda making fun of me for it and I just, just cuz I know the answer I'm not saying it anymore cuz they've been calling me school girl and stuff and it's-- I don't know. I don't-- nobody likes that. 

00:02:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, they're saying hurtful things to you. As I'm hearing this, in my head, I'm sitting here thinking, "What a capable young lady you are." Do you know how many kids wish they could come in here and tell me, "I'm so good at math." You are so capable. That's amazing to me. What's going well at school? 

00:03:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, well, I mean, I like the, I like being able to go to the band hall, that's fun and - 

00:03:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:03:20
ELIZABETH DEMING - I like having more time between classes - 

00:03:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:03:25
ELIZABETH DEMING - but I just-- I'm not having-- I don't like my hallway. I mean, a lot of people have been saying things about me in the hallway too. That's-- there are some things that's been popping up online and I-- and it's just really - 

00:03:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:03:40
ELIZABETH DEMING - frustrating. 

00:03:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay, so, I'm hearing things are popping up online, people are saying things in the hall. 

00:03:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:03:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS What-- has there been a time when you were at school and this wasn't happening, tell me about that. 

00:03:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, yeah, last year I was able to-- I mean, it was just cool, it's fine. I'd go to my classes, I did math team and I was in UIL and-- yeah, that was, that was a lot of fun. I, I, I did-- I, I was really, really involved but, you know, this year it's a lot different. 

00:04:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. You said something earlier to me. You said there's a lot more time between classes. Tell me what you meant by that. 

00:04:20
ELIZABETH DEMING I just mean it's a lot more-- like our passing period is a little bit longer so people are able to say things and-- un-- under their breath and - 

00:04:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:04:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - just kind of s-- you know, say things to me when I'm going to class. 

00:04:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So... 

00:04:35
ELIZABETH DEMING And it's kids I don't even know either. I don't even know how they, how they're seeing that. I mean, I know these girls, like I said, they've been putting things on, on Facebook and on Twitter. They somehow get pictures and they do those really mean - 

00:04:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:04:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - memes and stuff with me and being school girl and smarty hands and they, you know, they put things all over my face and stuff and so-- then there's these kids in the hallway, they don't even know me at all and they just, you know, snigger at me and they say all these things and I don't like, you know, no one likes that. 

00:05:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS That's very hurtful - 

00:05:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:05:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - to hear all of that. Forgive my ignorance but you use the word "memes". Please tell me what you're talking about. 

00:05:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, that's like, like a picture and then people put words over it and it just pops up and people can create them and do whatever they want. So, one person grabbed a picture of me, uhm, in math class with my hand up and then they drew horns on me and put words above it and, you know, rotten school girl and stuff and then posted that and that got everywhere. So, all these girls and all these people that I don't even know are seeing this. And so I get home from school and I see that online and there's like 50 likes. I mean, who would like that? 

00:05:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Well, I think you're pretty amazing because I spent some time visiting with your mom and I know that you've been skipping class a little bit but I know you're not skipping class everyday and I know that all of your grades in those classes are not bad. So, I know that you have something in you that's giving you the courage and the strength to show up despite all of this hurtful behavior that's going on at school and I, I really that's gonna help you to get through this. I wanna play just a little pretend game with you. Are you okay with that? 

00:06:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:06:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. I like you to just kind of sit back and I want you to close your eyes for a minute, just take a deep breath, kinda relax, and I would like for you to think for just a moment, pretend that the lights went out and someone waved a magic wand and when they waved that magic wand you could feel something was happening. It was amazing because then all of a sudden you opened your eyes and you went, "Wow! This is so great! Everything in my life is perfect!" Okay, Elizabeth, go ahead and open your eyes. If that had happened, what would be different? 

00:07:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I wouldn't feel-- I feel like I would be able to go to school and enjoy it like I used to cuz I liked that I was good at, you know, the classes that I was in. 

00:07:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:07:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, I feel like I'd feel more proud of myself because I'm achieving something and, uhm... 

00:07:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, it makes you feel good to know that you're doing well? 

00:07:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. I do. I just, I mean, I just don't go to those classes because, specially on day when-- at night, you know, they posted something, I just-- I can't stand to be around them so - 

00:07:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:07:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - I just-- I'm just kinda scared of what they're gonna say so sometimes I leave but if that situation would happen I wouldn't leave anymore. I would, you know, be active and still participate. 

00:08:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And if you were active and you were still participating and you were feeling successful just like you just described, how would you be different? 

00:08:15
ELIZABETH DEMING I feel like I wouldn't be as worried about school. I would - 

00:08:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. 

00:08:20
ELIZABETH DEMING - feel like I'm-- I mean, it's really a burden. It's-- it really weighs on me. I've dread, you know, getting up and going - 

00:08:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:08:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - and I feel like I wouldn't have to dread it. 

00:08:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. I'm hearing a lot of worry about going to school. What emotions would you like to feel when you're at school that would replace worry? 

00:08:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, I'd like to feel comfortable. 

00:08:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:08:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, just being able to go without thinking about what they're whispering about in the hallway - 

00:08:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:08:55
ELIZABETH DEMING - and just be able to kinda walk freely - 

00:08:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:08:55
ELIZABETH DEMING - without having to think about them. 

00:09:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And if I saw you walking in the hall and they weren't whispering about because this miracle had occurred, what would I notice about you if I saw you I got, "Wow! Something's going well for Elizabeth here. Something's happened," and I would see you. What would I notice about you? W-- how would you be different? 

00:09:20
ELIZABETH DEMING I wouldn't be walking as fast. 

00:09:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. You'd slow down. 

00:09:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, yeah. And I'd probably, you know, when you're happy, you're like that, you kinda stand up straight, I guess, and you just smile. 

00:09:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:09:30
ELIZABETH DEMING I think you're just a lot lighter. 

00:09:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS A little more confidence. 

00:09:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:09:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Feeling good about yourself. So, I've heard that you would like to feel happy, you'd like the worry to go away, that there are a lot of emotions you'd like to replace right now. 

00:09:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:09:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And that would help you a lot at school. I'd like to talk a little bit about some of those feelings. Uhm, I have some papers here and what I'd like for you to do is something a little different. So, are you okay with being adventurous today? 

00:09:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Sure. 

00:10:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Maybe you're isn't used in drawing. Okay. 

00:10:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:10:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS I'm gonna hand you one at a time three sheets of paper. The first sheet of paper says "home" and what I'd like for you to do on that sheet of paper is choose a color. The color can mean whatever you, you want it to mean but I'd like for it to represent a feeling that you have when you're at home and I'd like for you to draw that color however you would like on the sheet of paper. And then when you finish that, I'm gonna ask you to choose yet another feeling at home so leave a little bit of room so that you can put all of the feelings that you have at home. 

00:10:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:10:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. You start with home. 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've chosen red? 

00:10:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Pink. 

00:10:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Pink. 

00:10:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Pink. 

00:10:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've chosen pink. And you draw on a squiggle that looks like pink. Okay, great. And you're even writing the word. So, pink to you means excited. Tell me about excited and home and what that has to do with you. 

00:11:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, well, I like, you know, being able to go home, I, I like my house and I like being around there and at home, ah, we go on lots of trips and so I like - 

00:11:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Ah. 

00:11:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - to-- that's something I look forward to. It's, ah, it's something... 

00:11:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You like to travel. 

00:11:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:11:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you know, with everything that you've told me this morning I really didn't expect to see this. I am so amazed because you're telling me all of this worry and everything that's going on and yet the first feeling that you drew on this paper was something very positive, excitement. That tells me you've got a pretty good connection at home. Things are going pretty well at home. 

00:11:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. It-- and there's nothing going-- it's getting home that I'm excited about. 

00:12:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:12:00
ELIZABETH DEMING So. 

00:12:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS That's wonderful. So, you do have a connection. Sounds like you have a good connection with mom. 

00:12:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:12:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. Are there any other feelings? If so, draw them on there and tell me about them. 

00:12:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Hmm. 

00:12:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've chosen green. 

00:12:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:12:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And this time you drawn a long straighter looking line. 

00:12:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, this my feeling is... 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Comfortable? 

00:12:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:12:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about comfortable at home. 

00:12:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I feel like I can be myself at home and around my sisters. 

00:12:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:12:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm... 

00:12:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Again, those great connections that you have not just with mom but it sounds like with your sisters as well. 

00:12:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Ah, yeah. I, ah, I like to be home and it's-- I feel more at ease - 

00:13:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:13:00
ELIZABETH DEMING - I guess and quite as tense at school. So, I am-- look forward to being able to come home and not being at school anymore. 

00:13:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Sounds like you're very blessed that you have a great family. 

00:13:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:13:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. Tell me about any other feelings that you have when you're at home. 

00:13:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Hmm. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've chosen blue and this time you drew a squiggly line for blue. 

00:13:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah, and this one, I think I feel a little bit more... 

00:13:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Sad, and you've written the word sad. Tell me about that. 

00:13:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, when I go home usually it's, you know, I'm happy not to be at school anymore but that's also kind of where I see the things that are happening online. 

00:14:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:14:00
ELIZABETH DEMING And that's when I'm at home-- it all happens at night like when everyone's around their computers and stuff and so, you know, I'm just on Facebook or doing my homework or something and I see that pop up and - 

00:14:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:14:15
ELIZABETH DEMING - then I just know that the next day is gonna be r-- pretty bad. 

00:14:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yeah. 

00:14:20
ELIZABETH DEMING And so I lose all those feelings of being comfortable then I go into the dread again, so - 

00:14:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:14:25
ELIZABETH DEMING - that just makes me really upset. 

00:14:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So some of the dread does follow you at home. 

00:14:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:14:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS On a scale from one to 10, with that sad that you just drew, if one means that it's the worst in the world, i-- the sadness couldn't be any worse and remember we're talking about at home, and 10 means that you got complete control of it. It's not a problem for you at all. Where would you say you are? 

00:14:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Hmm. Right now I think I'm at, ah, maybe a four. 

00:15:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS A four. Wow! You didn't expect me to say that, I can tell that. Well, I didn't expect to hear four because when you're talking about everything that's going on at school, it sounds very bad, it sounds like you're very worried but yet you're telling me four. What have you done to get yourself up to a four? 

00:15:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I, ah, sometimes I just-- I don't know. I'd-- sometimes I just don't look at it. 

00:15:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. Don't look at it. 

00:15:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Right. I mean like I just won't look at Facebook. 

00:15:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Ah! Okay, so Facebook is where most of this is happening, it sounds like. And you, you are a very strong person. There are not very many young people that will say, "Well, I'll just not look at Facebook." How, how does that work for you? 

00:15:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, - 

00:15:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about that. 

00:15:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - if that-- because I would-- I do wanna be connected, I mean, that's kind of where everyone talks about things and where you'd like to post lots of pictures - 

00:15:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:15:55
ELIZABETH DEMING - and stuff but, you know, sometimes I just don't wanna-- someone will text me and tell me that something's up and I just don't wanna look at it because I don't want it to ruin my day. You know, ruin my night at home and I just don't-- I just try to ignore it but then I hear it in the hallways so. 

00:16:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Well, that's pretty amazing that you're able to just go off and forget about it. Ah, so many people can't do that. It just haunts them all the time, so you've got something in you that's really helping you to cope by being able to walk away like that. 

00:16:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yes. 

00:16:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Are there any other feelings that you have at home that you'd like to tell me about? 

00:16:40
ELIZABETH DEMING I don't know. I think these are... 

00:16:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. All right. I'm gonna go ahead and set this down so that we can still see it but we can move on now to how you feel at school. So, we'll do the same thing. 

00:16:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've chosen orange and you've drawn a, a zigzag, jagged line. 

00:17:20
[sil.] 

00:17:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And you're writing frustrated and hurt above this orange-- did I read that correctly? 

00:17:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Hurried. 

00:17:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Hurried. All right. 

00:17:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Sorry for my handwriting. 

00:17:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Frustrated and hurried, explain hurried. 

00:17:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I don't think I can really relax at school. Fairly imagine I just try to get the day over with so I'm always just trying to get to class as fast as possible and kind of avoid, you know, that group as much as possible but people I don't even know, know me so that's really hard. So, I just kinda get to where I need to go very quickly if I can. 

00:18:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, it sounds like you're hiding, trying to rush through and hide. 

00:18:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:18:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. On a scale from one to 10 again, again with one meaning that this is really horrible and 10 meaning that this is not so bad, where would you say you are? 

00:18:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, at that I think I'm really at, ah, at a two. 

00:18:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS A two? Hey, even at school you're at a two. I re-- again, I didn't not hear-- expect to hear a two. What have you done-- what made you say two instead of one? 

00:18:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I think one would be where I can even be there at all, where I would just not good at school but I'm, - 

00:18:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:18:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - you know, I still go maybe not to all of the classes but I still try to go. I, I like, like band and, - 

00:18:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Oh. 

00:18:55
ELIZABETH DEMING - and some of the theater things I'm doing. 

00:19:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, I'm hearing that not all of school is bad. So while I'm hearing you say band is a pretty good place to be, ah, you've said that a couple of times. Tell me about band. 

00:19:10
ELIZABETH DEMING I just-- I like being in there and I like being around. It's not the same people in that group and we're all mixed together so the seniors don't really know me so no one is there to, you know, laugh at me or knows about that. So, they didn't really care, I just kinda get to blend in. 

00:19:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you're in with a little more mature group of students - 

00:19:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:19:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - when you're in band. It does sounds like you have some connectedness at school, you do have some seniors that you can hang out with and some people that are on your side and, and the whole world is not talking about you and, - 

00:19:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:19:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - and these things that you're telling me about. 

00:19:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. But I only get to see them during - 

00:19:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:19:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - those classes. 

00:19:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:19:55
ELIZABETH DEMING So, it's the rest of the day that I'm frustrated with - 

00:19:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:19:55
ELIZABETH DEMING - other things going on with my other classes. 

00:20:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Right. I'd like to go back to the number two again. You said you were at a two. What have you done, you personally, what have you done at school to be able to say two instead of one? Because, you see, I already know, ah, we've only talk for a few minutes but I already know a lot about you. I know you're very courageous, I know you're very capable, I know you have great connections with your family, I know you care about your family very much, and I know how smart you are in math. So, I know you have a lot going for you. So, when you tell me two, I know that there are thing within you that have helped you to be at that two. What are those things? 

00:20:45
ELIZABETH DEMING I think I, uhm, I want to do well - 

00:20:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:20:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - and I, I, you know, in the eighth grade and stuff I was on the math team and, you know, they're talking about getting into college and I know that's the path you need to go down to get to college, let's get to school. So, I still want to do well. 

00:21:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Wow! You already have that knowledge. You already have that, that-- I, I wish every student could say to me what you just said that they have that life path, they have that goal, they know where they're going, they know the end result. That is again, something else that's amazing about you that's-- I, I expect that has a lot to do with why you're still going to class despite everything that's going on. 

00:21:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. I, I still get up and go so I think that's what-- that's where I'm not a one, I guess, - 

00:21:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:21:35
ELIZABETH DEMING - cuz I'm still trying. 

00:21:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, it's all about how you are such a great person. 

00:21:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. I guess. 

00:21:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And all of these things like coura-- that you're courageous, you're capable, you already have a well-developed life plan and path ahead of you, you're able to think into the future, that's really amazing. You're very special that you're able to do that already. 

00:22:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Thank you. 

00:22:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And you have that going for you. Tell me about other feelings that you're having at school. 

00:22:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, kind of along with this one, I knew that I wanted to use this one. 

00:22:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And this is-- I got it wrong last time. So is this red or pink? 

00:22:20
ELIZABETH DEMING This one is red. 

00:22:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. 

00:22:25
ELIZABETH DEMING I was... 

00:22:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've chosen red and this time you've made it, ah, a line that looks kinda humps. 

00:22:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Well, cuz this happens a lot. I, I get angry at school. 

00:22:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Angry, you've written the word angry. 

00:22:40
ELIZABETH DEMING I ge-- all of because that frustration, all those-- it's the set of girls that just continue, you know, to kind of break me in class and when you're, you know, you're new to high school is hard as it is - 

00:22:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:23:00
ELIZABETH DEMING - and, you know, these are, these are girls I didn't go to junior high with, I don't know them at all. They just didn't like that I knew the answers in class and call me a school girl instead and I, I used to like really enjoy being good at something, I enjoyed being good at math but they make me not want to be good at math. 

00:23:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS They've made you ashamed of being so smart. 

00:23:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. And, you know, I tried to be like it doesn't really matter, it's okay that I'm a school girl, I'll try to be proud to be a school girl but not when, you know, they share it with everybody else and everyone else sees it and it's just a continuous-- I, I keep saying like people that I don't even know at all - 

00:23:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:23:40
ELIZABETH DEMING - just they know my name and they say things about me and to me in the hallway. I'm like I have no idea, you know, how just this few amount of people get something started and it just keeps going. 

00:23:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Well, I think it's amazing that you are so smart in math, I think it's amazing that you're so capable. I think most people would think that. On a scale from one to 10 again, with this emotion, angry, where are you? 

00:24:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, that happens a l-- a lot more but I think I would say I'm at a three. 

00:24:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS A three. Okay. That, that's even higher than the o-- the frustration and hurried. A three. What are you doing to help yourself get up to a three? 

00:24:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Cuz I'm-- I think I'm not getting angry back. 

00:24:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Ah. 

00:24:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Ah, I mean, they... 

00:24:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Wow! That's great, that's great. 

00:24:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Cuz I don't, I don't try to like post something about them or anything. I mean, they, they make angry but I'm not, you know. I don't, I don't go after them or anything. I don't think that will be right. 

00:25:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:25:00
ELIZABETH DEMING I just mean-- I mean, it's not fair that they're doing that to me but I don't think-- I don't know how to explain that, really. I just... 

00:25:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You have a very strong sense of values. You know right and wrong - 

00:25:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:25:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - and so you haven't tried to retaliate. I am impressed, I'm very impressed. What is it that's, that's helping you not to do that, to retaliate? 

00:25:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, it's something that I, I'm glad I get to talk to my mom about this - 

00:25:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:25:35
ELIZABETH DEMING - and it's one of those things she just keeps saying, you know, "this to shall pass" kind of thing - 

00:25:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:25:40
ELIZABETH DEMING - but-- and I, I know it well. It's just-- it's still hard not to get angry. 

00:25:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:25:45
ELIZABETH DEMING But it doesn't mean I have to lash out, you know, and I haven't done anything like that. It's just really hurtful. 

00:25:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Sound like talking to your mom is very helpful for you. 

00:26:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:26:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Are there any other emotions that you're having at school that you like to share with me? 

00:26:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Hmm. Well, I guess it's just the-- I don't know. I think that's, that's what's happening at school. 

00:26:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. Oh, again, I'm gonna set this one out of the way so we can see it but we can move on. You said that when you're on Facebook, this is when a lot of the problem is happening. So, I'd like you to do the same thing with online. 

00:26:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've drawn what looks to be like a tornado? 

00:26:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:26:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS In blue. 

00:26:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I think I feel embarrassed a lot of time online just because seeing that, seeing those things and those pictures and I guess the captions and then, and then the comments that people say that makes it worse. And, ah, I mean, you can't help but feel like just not-- you're not happy to see something like that. You kinda feel shamed and embarrassed and I think that's kinda draws me down. 

00:27:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, it's humiliation. 

00:27:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. On a scale from one to 10, where would you say you are? 

00:27:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, that one, I think embarrassed, I think that one is a one. 

00:27:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. So, you've selected a one. I'm still, believe it or not, I'm still looking at you going, "Wow! If it's not a one, how are you managing to still go to school, to still get through your day?" What are you doing for yourself to help you with that? 

00:28:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, like I still talk to my, talk to my mom and I do have friends, you know, I, I do have a, a couple of close friends and - 

00:28:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:28:15
ELIZABETH DEMING - like I said going to those classes with them, - 

00:28:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:28:20
ELIZABETH DEMING - it's talking to them helps. 

00:28:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yeah. So, you do have some friends that are on your side through all of this. 

00:28:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. They don't do any of - 

00:28:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:28:25
ELIZABETH DEMING - of the things on Facebook at all. 

00:28:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And it sounds like hanging out with them, talking to them is helpful for you. 

00:28:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:28:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS What other emotions do you have when you're online that you'd like to share with me? You've chosen brown and you've made a very dark, bold line with brown. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And you've written the word hurt. Tell me about that hurt. 

00:29:10
ELIZABETH DEMING I just-- it's really-- it's hard to see those things, uhm, that people say and the consistency of it, I guess, I see it a lot and, you know, like I said before people wanna get on Facebook and just-- and talk about things and share, you know, make jokes and funny things and people in that school they talk about what happens online or what they see and this is all targeted at me. 

00:29:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:29:45
ELIZABETH DEMING So, yeah, it hurts. It hurts a lot. 

00:29:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you feel like you're a target and you've told me a lot about all of these kids at school and everybody who you feel like is making fun of you and not on your side. Tell me about all of the people who would say that that's ridiculous, all of these things you're seeing and would go, "That is not important, they don't even know what they're talking about." Tell me about those people, what would they say, and who are those people? 

00:30:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, of course, I'm in-- I get to talk to my mom and - 

00:30:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Right. 

00:30:15
ELIZABETH DEMING - and my friends. Uhm... 

00:30:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Your mom and your friends, they would say, "Whatever they're writing on there is ridiculous"? 

00:30:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:30:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:30:20
ELIZABETH DEMING I think, well, I mean, Ms. Jones(ph), my math teacher, she was-- she helped us a lot - 

00:30:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:30:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - when I was in eighth grade. Uhm, I think she, she was always talking about, you know, she is the one who got me look at color and change stuff and thinking not on that path. So, I bet she would that probably it wasn't very important. 

00:30:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. So, Mrs. Jones, your mom, your family, your friends, - 

00:30:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:30:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - would look at the things that they're writing about you and they'd be on your side. 

00:30:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:30:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, even though it may seem like you're very alone, in reality you're not very alone. 

00:31:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. I guess so. 

00:31:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Not when you stop and you think about all of the people who are really on your side while you're going through all of this. 

00:31:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:31:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about the people you respect. When we talk about the people, the ones that are making fun of you or the ones that would say, that stuff is ridiculous - 

00:31:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. The seniors wouldn't make me feel that way. 

00:31:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about the respect. With, with seniors, where does your respect falls, seniors or freshmen? 

00:31:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Oh, seniors. 

00:31:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yeah. Uh-huh. And the seniors, what would-- what do you think they would say about the things that are popping up. 

00:31:35
ELIZABETH DEMING I don't think they care at all. They... 

00:31:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-huh. 

00:31:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:31:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-huh. 

00:31:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Not concern with that. 

00:31:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. Exactly, exactly. So, it sounds to me like your respect falls on the side of all the people who would be on your side. 

00:31:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. Yeah. Just try not to care about what they say. 

00:31:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS What does that say to you? 

00:32:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I guess if it doesn't matter to those people then it shouldn't matter to me. But I think it still does a little bit. 

00:32:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. It's probably going to be hurtful - 

00:32:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:32:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - but at the same time if I'm hearing you correctly what you're saying is that you know that in a grand scheme, the end results kind of like you said, you have a long life path, you already know where you're going, that all of that really isn't gonna be all that important specially not to the people that are on your side and going places. 

00:32:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:32:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yeah. On a scale from one to 10, you said that the hurt was at a one... 

00:32:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Well, and that's just-- I mean, just cuz it keeps happening, I think it's just continuing to happen. 

00:32:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Have you done anything for yourself to help you, what would it take for you to get from say just a one to a two? 

00:33:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, I guess, I don't know. Ah, I just kinda think more like, like I said, my friends are seniors, it's just, ah, kind of being like kinda tough and just not think about it or not not think about it but kind of try to put more like it doesn't really matter. Like in the long run, it might not really matter at all. 

00:33:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS What I'm kinda hearing, you correct if I'm wrong, but I was kinda hearing maybe move to that level of maturity that they have. 

00:33:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Yeah. Kind of being like that and just not worry about it. 

00:33:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. That's pretty amazing that you're able to have-- to even think that way. Hmm. Are there any other feelings that you're having when you're online that you'd like to share with me? 

00:34:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I know this happen, uhm... 

00:34:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've drawn purple. 

00:34:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. And I, I do get kinda worried about. I guess I'm kinda... 

00:34:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Worried. 

00:34:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:34:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You've used that word before today. 

00:34:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Just cuz I don't-- I'm scared of what I'm gonna see - 

00:34:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:34:35
ELIZABETH DEMING - and, ah, and, you know, that stuff gets really-- it go-- goes around really fast and it, it gets to be really mean. So, sometimes I kinda dread looking at what's, what's there. 

00:34:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:34:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Or what, what just happened. 

00:34:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, the fear and the worry of seeing what's on there - 

00:34:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:34:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - is making you-- is causing you other emotions. 

00:35:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:35:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS On a scale from one to 10 where are you with worried? 

00:35:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, I think, yeah, I'm probably still at a one. 

00:35:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. What would it take for you to move up to a two with that emotion? Just up to a two - 

00:35:25
ELIZABETH DEMING I guess 

00:35:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - not a 10. 

00:35:25
ELIZABETH DEMING I know. 

00:35:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Just to two. 

00:35:25
ELIZABETH DEMING I think to-- I think it's kinda like the hurt one. 

00:35:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:35:35
ELIZABETH DEMING It's just trying to get above it, I guess. 

00:35:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:35:40
ELIZABETH DEMING You know, trying to, to make it not as important. 

00:35:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:35:45
ELIZABETH DEMING I mean, I still think-- I mean, I try not to like think that that's important and, you know, it's nice to think that, "Oh, yeah, those things won't affect me," but they do hurt. 

00:35:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:35:55
ELIZABETH DEMING And it does, you know, I get nervous about what I'm gonna see and such but-- so I think just, you know, trying to be a little bit, hmm, just make it less of a worry. 

00:36:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, if I heard you right, focusing on your priorities - 

00:36:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:36:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - you think would be helpful for you to move from a one to step to a two. 

00:36:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:36:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. Are there any other feelings you would like to share when you're online? 

00:36:25
ELIZABETH DEMING No. I think that's all. 

00:36:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. I'm gonna move this out of the way so you can still see it. We're gonna kinda move all of these negative feelings out of the way like you want them to be. All right, I have some cards here, Elizabeth, and I'd like you to read the words that are on these cards and then just tell me what they mean to you. 

00:36:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Revenge. 

00:36:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about revenge to you, what does that mean? 

00:37:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, that's a lot of the getting back at somebody or somebody who's hurt you. 

00:37:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You talked a little bit about that earlier. Can you tell me where that might fit in all of these emotions that you drew earlier? 

00:37:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, revenge, ah, I don't think I'm-- I don't think I'm somebody who can do revenge. 

00:37:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:37:25
ELIZABETH DEMING I just-- cuz that doesn't make me feel good about that, you know, still hurting somebody. 

00:37:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS I think that might kinda go back to the very first thing that I saw in you and I said, "You have a lot of courage being here to talk to me, and I think it takes a lot of courage not to go out and retaliate against people who are making you feel so bad." 

00:37:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:37:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS But it also takes not only courage but it takes strength to not get even with those people as well. All right. You wanna kinda set that down there on whichever of these that you think that matches with the most - 

00:38:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm... 

00:38:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - for you. 

00:38:05
ELIZABETH DEMING I think on, ah, hurt. 

00:38:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Right. 

00:38:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Ah, this one's inadequacy. 

00:38:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me what that means to you. 

00:38:20
ELIZABETH DEMING I guess to not matter to somebody or matter to... 

00:38:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Hmm. Okay. 

00:38:25
ELIZABETH DEMING To not have any worth. 

00:38:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. So, so to not have any worth. Are there any feelings down here that that would match with? 

00:38:35
ELIZABETH DEMING I think this matches with sad. 

00:38:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about how that matches with sad? What that means to you? 

00:38:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I guess, the feeling if you're not worth something that's not gonna make you-- you will feel like-- you'll feel pretty unhappy about that and sadden, you know, a little upset. 

00:38:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. All right, and for your personally? 

00:39:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, you know, with these people who post that stuff about me, I don't matter to them. 

00:39:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:39:05
ELIZABETH DEMING They don't, don't think they get out of me as, as just the jokes. So, of course, that's gonna make me sad. 

00:39:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:39:15
ELIZABETH DEMING So... 

00:39:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, it makes you feel inadequate when they say these things about you. 

00:39:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Sure. Uh-hmm. I don't matter to them. I'm not worth anything to them so that makes me feel that way. 

00:39:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Hmm. I-- you've tell me again about all of these people who would say that you are inadequate, tell me about what your mom and your friends and the seniors. If I ask them about you, what would they tell me? 

00:39:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, my friends would think I'm-- I think they think I'm pretty neat. I'm pretty cool with them. 

00:39:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Neat. Tell me what, tell me what neat-- about neat. 

00:39:55
ELIZABETH DEMING I guess, just, ah, I mean, I'm involved in a lot of things or I used to be so, - 

00:40:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:40:05
ELIZABETH DEMING - you know, I'm-- I can do the band and, and math and theater and all those things so I guess that's I think an interesting mix, those things. 

00:40:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, they would say, "She's good at everything." 

00:40:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah 

00:40:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. That doesn't sound very inadequate to me. That sounds pretty adequate. Uh-hmm. 

00:40:20
ELIZABETH DEMING I guess I can be. 

00:40:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. Next card. 

00:40:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Ah, attention. 

00:40:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me how that fits in, if it does. 

00:40:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, I think this one goes with embarrassed. 

00:40:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Tell me about that connection. 

00:40:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Cuz I think it's a lot of negative attention. 

00:40:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Okay. 

00:40:45
ELIZABETH DEMING It's not like-- I think some people would see that and like, "Oh, she's getting a lot of attention," but it's, it's all bad stuff that some people know me from, - 

00:40:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:40:55
ELIZABETH DEMING - you know, the bad things that are going on. But-- so it just makes me embarrassed and all that negative attention. 

00:41:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. So you feel like you're getting a negative attention when before you were getting positive attention because you were on the math team, you were doing so well, and, now that you're getting negative attention it almost sounds to me like you've stopped doing the things that get you positive attention. What do you think about that? 

00:41:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. I definitely think that what's happening -- 

00:41:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:41:25
ELIZABETH DEMING - I don't-- like I-- like the rush, you know, if I'm trying to go to class, I just don't wanna be seen very much so I don't want any attention. Just trying to - 

00:41:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:41:35
ELIZABETH DEMING - stay out of the way but that's not how I used to be. 

00:41:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. You're avoiding the negative attention and, and not trying to get the positive attention anymore. 

00:41:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:41:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Hmm. Hmm. What's the next one? 

00:41:50
ELIZABETH DEMING This one says power. 

00:41:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about that one. 

00:41:55
ELIZABETH DEMING I think power means to, uhm, I guess this is like how you feel, you know, powerful and sometime strong or enabled. 

00:42:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Hmm. Okay. Okay. 

00:42:15
ELIZABETH DEMING And I think this one would go with probably the angry. 

00:42:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:42:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Cuz I feel they, ah, it's more like they make me feel powerless - 

00:42:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:42:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - so I am angry about it. 

00:42:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:42:35
ELIZABETH DEMING There's-- I don't feel like there's anything I can do about it. 

00:42:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. So you feel like your power has been taken away from you. 

00:42:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. That way. 

00:42:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And it kinda, again, it goes back to the one-- attention. I think it was attention where you said you were getting a lot of negative attention rather than positive attention and it sounds almost like by not doing the things that get you the positive attention, it's removed some of your power. 

00:43:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. I can say that for sure. That's I don't feel very powerful, I don't feel like I can stop what's going on. So - 

00:43:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:43:10
ELIZABETH DEMING - I don't feel powerful at all. 

00:43:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Hmm. And yet you have all of these people who are on your side. Name them again. 

00:43:20
ELIZABETH DEMING Here's my friends and my mom and - 

00:43:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:43:25
ELIZABETH DEMING - Ms. Jones(ph) who likes me. 

00:43:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And when I asked you who the people were-- you were respecting, you said... 

00:43:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. The seniors. 

00:43:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:43:30
ELIZABETH DEMING All of my friends that are seniors and band. 

00:43:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Okay. Something to think about. I have four more cards here. And these aren't a little different kind of cards. I want you to read these words just out loud and just tell me what they mean, what you think the definition is of this. 

00:43:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. Courage. Ah, just to be, to be brave, uhm... 

00:43:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS I've heard that a lot about you today. You've told me so much about you that is courageous. Tell me some of the things you've done that are courageous. 

00:44:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I still go to school. 

00:44:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yeah. You still go to school no matter what-- despite everything. You're still going to school. You're amazing. 

00:44:15
ELIZABETH DEMING And I still, uhm, I still wanna finish, you know, I still wanna go to college so... 

00:44:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And you have a really good long term plan for yourself which at your age is fantastic. You're way ahead of the game. 

00:44:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Thanks. And I guess, uhm, for-- like I don't wanna get back at them. 

00:44:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And it takes a lot of courage not to get revenge. 

00:44:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:44:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And you've shown a lot of that and a lot of strength as well. Anything else that you think you've done that's courageous? 

00:44:55
ELIZABETH DEMING I don't think, I don't think so. I don't know. 

00:45:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. Let me take this one and we'll put it here. What's the next word? 

00:45:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Capable. 

00:45:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Capable. What does that mean to you? 

00:45:10
ELIZABETH DEMING I think being, uhm, able to do something good or do-- you know, take some initiative. 

00:45:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And tell me something that you've done like we talked a little bit about that already today, didn't we? Have you done that shows you're capable? 

00:45:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I, you know, I do get good grades, - 

00:45:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:45:35
ELIZABETH DEMING - I know how to, I mean, I, I always know the answer - 

00:45:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:45:40
ELIZABETH DEMING - so I'm able to do that. 

00:45:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS When I heard I'm on the math team, I've had perfect grades in math, I went, "This girl is very capable. No doubt about it." Anything else you've done that you think makes you very capable. 

00:46:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Hmm. I don't know. I don't think so. 

00:46:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. We'll come back to it then. Tell me about this one. 

00:46:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Connected. I think being in touch with, uhm, people or, you know, something that keeps you striving to do something - 

00:46:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:46:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - and connected, I think, yeah, it just means like you wanna be involved. 

00:46:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. And when I think of connected I immediately think of your mom and I, I really think it's pretty amazing at your age you have such a great connection with your mom and even your sisters you talked about, about that a little bit and what a positive that is for you and it tells me you're such a caring, giving person that you have such a great relationship with your mom and your sisters. Then there's one more card. 

00:47:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Ah, count. 

00:47:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Count, what does that mean to you if you were to count? 

00:47:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Uhm, I think it would mean that I-- that somebody cares about me, that I, I matter to somebody. 

00:47:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. That you're important, that you matter. 

00:47:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:47:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Tell me about that. Tell me about that in your life. 

00:47:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, the fact that-- I guess, I think Ms. Jones(ph) is upset that I'm not - 

00:47:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - as involved or, you know, doing the things that I-- she saw me do last year so I guess I matter to her. 

00:48:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Ms. Jones(ph) thinks you're amazing. She thinks you're one of the brightest students that she has. She's been very worried about you, as well. 

00:48:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah.I have only been in here doing well at her class. 

00:48:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. And she's concerned and, and she definitely does think that you count and that you matter and I know your mom definitely thinks that you matter as well. 

00:48:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:48:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And, actually, the seniors probably think you matter specially in the band when-- at your part. 

00:48:30
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:48:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. I would like for you to think about a time when you're having all of these negative feelings that we've talked about, that you drew about. And I want you to think of a time that you used one of these words - courage, capability, connectedness or that you count, that you use one of this to help yourself get through this. Draw me a picture of that. 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You're making some-- a lot of brown lines. It looks like a person. 

00:49:35
[sil.] 

00:49:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Making something very dark. 

00:49:45
ELIZABETH DEMING That's me at my computer. 

00:49:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:49:50
ELIZABETH DEMING I remember... 

00:49:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you're so sitting at your computer - 

00:49:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:49:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - typing, it looks like. 

00:49:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. And I remember, I remember one time I just-- I kinda was fed up with it and I just shut my computer. 

00:50:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Wow! So, you mean you were able-- while all this was going on to just shut your computer. 

00:50:15
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. Well, yeah, cuz I didn't wanted-- I mean, I was having a really good day, that was after - 

00:50:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:50:20
ELIZABETH DEMING - our competition and - 

00:50:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:50:20
ELIZABETH DEMING - go and see all that. I just didn't wanna deal with that one. My good day just keep going so - 

00:50:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:50:25
ELIZABETH DEMING - I just shut my computer. 

00:50:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS So, you have the strengths to just shut the computer and, I presume, walk away. 

00:50:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:50:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS That's amazing. 

00:50:35
ELIZABETH DEMING I just didn't look at that anymore. 

00:50:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Wow! How did you do that? 

00:50:45
ELIZABETH DEMING I think that's the point where it-- I just knew that it was just gonna be there no matter what - 

00:50:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:50:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - but I didn't have to-- have it ruin my day that day. So I just didn't let it ruin my day. 

00:51:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:51:00
ELIZABETH DEMING I just decided that I would be okay without it. 

00:51:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. So something in you just said, "I don't need this." 

00:51:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:51:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And you were able to shut your computer and walk away. That is really amazing that you were able to do that. What are some other things, some other times when you've been able to do things that helped you through all of this? 

00:51:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Ah, well I've, you know, I get involved, I'm so involved with my friends so - 

00:51:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:51:30
ELIZABETH DEMING - we just kind of like to go out sometimes and just hang out. 

00:51:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. So, spending time talking to your friends is very helpful for you. 

00:51:40
ELIZABETH DEMING And also with my mom too, so... 

00:51:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. And also talking to your mom. 

00:51:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:51:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS What other things do you think, uhm, have you done in the past that have helped you to be able to get through all of this? 

00:52:00
[sil.] 

00:52:05
ELIZABETH DEMING I think I've just been able to think about the future, I guess think - 

00:52:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:52:10
ELIZABETH DEMING - about the time when it might not happen anymore. So, I'm just kinda waiting for that time to come. 

00:52:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. So, thinking about the future. 

00:52:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:52:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And your life plan is helpful for you. I'm kind of, you know, when, when I'm talking to you I'm really impressed because I'm sitting here with someone who's telling me, uhm, people are making fun of me, they're talking about me in the hall and yet you have you have the courage to come in here and talk to me about it and share all of this. You have a great connection with your mom, you're a very caring person, you have a great home life. I mean, some of your first emotions that you wrote down were very positive about what's going on at home. You're very capable. Do you know how envious most people would be of your math ability? 

00:53:05
ELIZABETH DEMING I guess. 

00:53:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You're, you're a very amazing, strong, courageous, capable person and I, I think you're right. I think that it would be great if all of this would stop and I also agree that you need to start seeing achievement and feeling good about yourself for your achievement again. And I'm, I'm, I'm kind of wondering. I, I was thinking about one of these words that you've read here, that word count. 

00:53:35
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:53:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And I thought, "Hmm, Elizabeth was probably not the only person that's going through this right now." What do you think about that when I, when I say that? 

00:53:50
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, like I haven't been in class or anything. 

00:53:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:53:55
ELIZABETH DEMING So, I guess, my teacher see that. 

00:54:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. They noticed that you haven't been there. 

00:54:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:54:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS But I'm wondering when I think about all of the other kids that are probably going through the same thing that you are. 

00:54:10
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Well, because there are still people like that who - 

00:54:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:54:10
ELIZABETH DEMING - like just to pick on people so I think they're probably out there. 

00:54:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And you, you said something else to me. You said it's just not within me to get even, to be vengeful. You, you read the word revenge, - 

00:54:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:54:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - that that's just not part of your value system and I know that there are whole lot of girls, boys out there, some of them your age, some of them younger than you that are probably going through the same thing that you are. What would you think about helping someone get through this? 

00:54:45
ELIZABETH DEMING Like if they were younger than me trying to teach them what I have done, yeah. I think that's something I could do. 

00:54:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:54:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Try to help that from not happening again. 

00:54:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. We don't have to decide that today but I'm thinking that that might be a way for you to, uhm, feel like you count and to help somebody else feel like they count. You know how you've been feeling this last few weeks since this has been happening to you and I think, you know, with your courage, your strength, your ability to shut the computer and walk away, amazing. I'm just thinking that how much you could give to someone else who's going through this right now and we don't have to decide whether that will be today but I'm thinking maybe we can meet again and between now and next week you could put some thought into how you might make that work and we can visit about that. Tell me your thoughts about that. 

00:55:40
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. Cuz nobody likes to feel like this. Nobody wants to kinda feel like they're target so - 

00:55:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:55:50
ELIZABETH DEMING - I think if I could help that then that would be-- that would make me feel good too. 

00:55:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay. So that sounds like maybe you would like to do. I also listen to you while you were talking a little bit to me some of the things that already work for you and you tell me you said that the things that helped you were to shut the computer - 

00:56:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:56:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - and just walk away. I don't know how you do that, I think that's amazing but I'm glad that you're able to do that and I'm thinking that between now and next week it might be good for you to do a little more of that. Something else that you tell me is you said spending time talking to your friends and talking to your mom - 

00:56:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:56:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS - was very helpful for you and I'm thinking that that might be something also you could do. I'm, I'm wondering if talking to your mom-- you said talking to your mom is helpful for you. Tell me your thoughts about all of this that's going on and having talk to your mom I can tell you she has no idea about this or at least that's been my perspective. Tell me your thoughts on that. 

00:56:55
ELIZABETH DEMING Well, I mean, I, I can talk to her about, you know, sometimes like my feelings and stuff but I haven't told her - 

00:57:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:57:00
ELIZABETH DEMING - about who's doing it. 

00:57:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:57:05
ELIZABETH DEMING You know, so I guess I'm kind of giving her a little bit information about it, - 

00:57:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:57:15
ELIZABETH DEMING - kinda make her feel, ah, or just understand what I'm going through - 

00:57:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:57:15
ELIZABETH DEMING - so she's not upset with me. 

00:57:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Do you feel comfortable with that? Would you... 

00:57:25
ELIZABETH DEMING I can talk to her. 

00:57:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

00:57:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. 

00:57:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS I'm wondering you and I might want to visit with her together, maybe you tell her what's going on and having talk to your mom I can tell you she knows very little about the internet, she may need someone to teach her a little bit about what's going on on the internet. Tell me your thoughts on that. 

00:57:45
ELIZABETH DEMING That's okay. I can show her. 

00:57:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. All right. So, maybe some time in the next week or so we could sit down and visit with your mom. All right, you also told me that talking to, ah, your friends, ah, would be helpful and you said thinking-- just thi-- focusing and thinking about your future was helpful for you. 

00:58:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Uh-hmm. 

00:58:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. Well, I, I think the-- that what you've already been doing if you'll do more of that over this next week, I'm thinking that that would be helpful for you but I, I would like for you to do something for me that's probably a little odd over this next week and you-- and, and I'll tell what it is and then you can tell me if you feel comfortable with this. 

00:58:25
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:58:25
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Over the next week, I'm thinking that you could pretend no matter what goes on, you could pretend that everything is going just like you would like for it to, that they are not talking about you, they are not picking on you in class, and no matter what they say or what they do, in your mind, it's not happening and you act. Remember, I asked you, I said, "How would you be different if the miracle occurred?" You act like that miracle has occurred no matter what. 

00:59:00
ELIZABETH DEMING Okay. 

00:59:00
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Do you think you could do that and then we can visit about that, how that work for you next week? 

00:59:05
ELIZABETH DEMING Yeah. We can see if that works. 

00:59:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right, great. 

00:59:15
[sil.] 

00:59:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Questions or comments. Yes. 

00:59:25
 Just really saw there are learning stuff spread it-- spread it through the solution focused, ah, uhm, but I was curious when you use the, ah, four mistaken goals, revenge, inadequacy, attention, and power. Uhm, she didn't really seem to buy into too many of those. If she had been, how would that have been difficult? 

00:59:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay, the reason that I incorporated this is not necessarily because of her scenario because she was gonna say, "I don't feel like I'm gonna have revenge," but we know that statistically kids that are victims are also bullies. So, one of the big problems that we have is to try and stop those mistaken goals particularly the one of revenge and had she been already participating in revenge then I would have come out of more of an educational side to that as in revenge is not going to get you as Adler would say spit in the soup with a revenge a little bit more. I go ahead and I put that in there because most of us are not gonna have kids like this who say, "Oh, no, I'm-- my values are so great. I don't wanna get even," although that's where she went. So, so I went with her on that. Ah, but, yeah, that's a great question. Any other questions or comments? One of the, ah, things that you didn't see because this is not a one session, uhm, program that I do is there has to be a component and I, I touched on it a little bit at the end where the parents learn a little bit about the internet because parents are clueless. And that a lot of parents out there still-- a, a lot of people have Facebook accounts and so forth but are not necessarily the places that the kids are. A lot of parents don't even know what social media is, they don't even understand what their kids are going through, so that has to be a big component of it is the education piece that goes along with this for the parents. Another thing that I didn't get into but then I would do in the next session and you're-- a-- I thought someone might ask me about this, I don't know if you can see these sheets of paper that she drew but these were the feeling sheets of paper. I would come back to this in the next session because I read a wonderful article by Lynne Shallcross that was about grief, had nothing to do with cyberbullying but it was about grief and it really touched me because the article in Counseling Today was about how when we lose something, it affects everything to do with us in our emotions. Kids that are being cyberbullying have experienced loss, they are grieving their reputation, they're grieving the loss of the life that they had before, and we have-- and that's part of the reason that I do this activity where we talk so much about the feelings because when I started working with kids who were bullied, I was pro-solution focused, 100% all the way and I realized that a lot of the grief that they were experiencing because of the bullying was not being processed thoroughly and so that's where the Adlerian piece came in and I started thinking about the feelings like this because that way we're able to then go back and process the grief that they're feeling. Because you know what? They're life is not gonna ever be the same. And that's just-- unfortunately, that is just a fact. They're gonna have to get through the humiliation and deal with some of, uhm, the, the way it's going to be in the future just like we do it with the death or any other type of loss that we experience. I have a PowerPoint that I'm gonna put on the wall, if you can see it over here. Matt(ph), can you turn that PowerPoint on? Cuz I thought you might be interested to know a little bit about, you know, here we are at ACA and I know one of the big, uhm, factors with doing something like this, at least for me, is it's highly unethical. My pet peeve is to see somebody go to a filing cabinet and pull a sheet out of a filing cabinet they've never read and go, "I can go and work with the client. I have a handout here." It's totally unethical. Uhm, everything that we do should be based on theory or some kind of a research that says that it works so I thought I would take just a minute and I would tell you a little bit about some of the pieces of this and how the theory fit in with that and I was so glad to hear, ah, your question when you said, "I can see how the theories fit in with this." So, thank you for saying that. 

01:04:05
Backgrond â–º It is estimated that 91% of kids 12 to 15 years old and almost all teens (99%) ages 16 to 18 use the Internet (UCLA Internet Report, 2003) â–º * 57% of students that someone had said hurtful or angry things to them online with 13% saying it happens "quite often" (I-Safe Survey, 2004) â–º * 53% of students admit saying mean or hurtful things to someone online and 7% admit to doing it "quite often" (I-Safe Survey, 2004) â–º Victims often become bullies themselves (Froeschle, 2010; Froeschle & Riney, 2008) â–º The Internet creates anonymity which creates a disconnect between the bully's behaviors and conscience (Froeschle, 2010). â–º Kids rarely tell adults about the bullying (Froeschle, Hargrave, Mayorga, & Castillo, 2008; Froeschle, 2010). 

01:04:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right. Can you click that to the next slide? One of the things I want you to be aware of and thank you so much for being here, you can see through, ah, for what you can see up there, the largest percentage of kids are gonna be dealing with this, period. So, almost every kid you see either going to be experiencing this or has experience this or is going to be experiencing it. Okay, next slide. The victims often become bullies themselves which you led me right into with your question about why I incorporated the revenge in there. The internet has made this far worse, they can't get away from this absolutely anywhere. And the third bullet up there, this one is really important when we're working with them is very rarely do they ever tell any adult about the bullying. Notice at the end of the session, I asked her, I said, "Do you-- would you like me to meet with you with your mom?" I did that on purpose. I didn't just sent her home to do that because adults don't handle this well. Adults, ah, teachers in the school immediately want to call the bully in and punish the bully. This is-- does not work. First off, we know punishment is very short-term that way it really doesn't work. And the next thing-- reason we don't wanna do this is because this can be handled in a much better way. Adults need to know that it's not so much that the bully needs to punished as much as it is, you, you just heard all the words, I had her go through. If you've studied a lot with play therapy, ah, Terry Kottman's Adlerian play therapy, you would-- then you heard some familiar terms, the crucial Cs up here. The word courageous, capable, count, and so forth, okay. That's what they need and that's what they-- when we talk to the adults, it's not "Oh, let's go and punish the bully," as much as it is "Let's make sure that the child who's being bullied has what they need as far as being cap-- feeling capable, courageous, and so forth," and that's why I spent so much time talking to her about who her allies were, who's on her side. Now, I'm not saying we can't do something about the bully cuz I think we need to work with the bully as well because the truth is the bully is probably been a victim as well. Yes. 

01:06:35
 I don't think you bring that up because I think one of the hesitations for kids talking to adults is when adults take it into their hands. Ultimately, the child becomes a further target. 

01:06:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yes, yes, and that's why I wanted to talk to the parent with her. I didn't wanna leave her to do this on her own so that the mom does know how to respond appropriately. Because the mom can actually make this worse for her. The teacher can make this worse for her. It's got to be done right. 

01:07:00
â–º Most parents underestimate their child's ability to bully or be a victim (according to Alane Fagin, the executive director of Child Abuse Prevention Services (CAPS). â–º 58% of minors have not told their parents or another adult about their experiences online (National I-Safe Survey, 2004) 

01:07:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uhm, most of the time parents have no idea this is going on, they underestimate their child's ability to be both a victim or a bully, and 58% of minors that are being bullied have not told any adult about this. So, it wasn't-- a-- this scenario was very real and that her mom really didn't know what was going on. Yes. 

01:07:25
 How are you going to do it if she came the next week and then bully had made like a counter move and up to the end and things get worse for her and she felt really defeated? 

01:07:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Explain to me what you mean cuz I'm not sure I understand. 

01:07:40
 Like if the, the bully increased, uhm, prank. It wasn't just online anymore. It started at school because they saw that it wasn't getting to her anymore and then she felt like she really tried the things that you talked about. She felt more discouraged. 

01:07:55
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Ah, well, that kind of what you're describing is kind of where she was. It was happening online but it was also going into the school where she was walking down the hall and they were bullying her at school as well. So, as far as this scenario goes, the way I would think it would increase and escalate would be when it gets to the point where they start becoming the bully themselves because that's typically the way kids will respond. When they start saying I'm the bully too and you start seeing that then you know it's gotten about-- its at that point where it's really bad. 

01:08:25
 Ah, just as, ah, tag along to that, what about social disconnected? Uhm, what if the, the elements of-- kind of the, uhm, the social networks, the, the bully and the other people - 

01:08:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yes. 

01:08:40
 - would like to be a part of it or at least respected by disconnector from Facebook, a disconnector from Snapchat. It becomes kind of in the dark a bit while other people are still part of the scene. 

01:08:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS I am so glad you ask that because that explains the reason why I think the social interest component is so important. Because whenever I-- at the end there, when I said, "How would you feel about helping somebody else," what you're gonna find when you do that is she's gonna go out there and you're gonna send her out there to help somebody else and guess what you've just done. You've taken two people that probably have no one as an ally, you put them together not only do they feel better about themselves cuz they're helping somebody else but you've created a social network. I also think if you're very, very careful and I will tell you what I mean by that, but if you're very careful you can do group counseling with these students. But when I say very careful, the victim and the bully can be the same person. What we don't want is to get a group of people like you were saying where it's escalated to the point where we have bully/victim in the room with other bully/victim and we wind up having a group of people who are going "Oh cool! If I wanna-- if I'm ready for a revenge I know exactly who I can get now." So, you have to be very careful and you have to screen very carefully if you're going to do that. Uhm, and same is gonna be true if I'm gonna send Elizabeth out there and have her become a mentor to a younger kid. I wanna make sure that they're both kind of at the same place. I don't want Elizabeth to go out there and tell the other kid, "Well, I just get even with them." So there's gonna have to be some really good counseling about that as well. 

01:10:10
Background â–º Cyberbullying leads to feelings of depression, hopelessness, anxiety, withdrawal, loneliness, and low self-esteem (Archer & Coyne, 2005; Crick & Nelson, 2002; Froeschle, Mayorga, Castillo, & Hargrave, 2008 Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1996; La Greca & Harrison, 2005; Storch, Masia-Warner, Crisp & Klein, 2005). â–º Cyberbullying leads to behaviors including poor academic performance and school adjustment, skipping school, bullying, social phobia, nightmares, loss of appetite, peer rejection, self-harm, and even suicide (Froeschle, Mayorga, Castillo & Hargrave, 2008; Strom & Strom, 2005; Willard, 2005) â–º Those experiencing aggression face social isolation in the short term and relationship problems as adults (Young, 2006). 

01:10:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay, great question. Thank you for asking that. Uhm, you can see her a lot of people discount cyberbullying. A lot of parents, they say, "Well, this is just a, a fad. It will pass. We all went through it." But the truth is, now, with cyberbullying, that's really not the case. We have kids that are everything from depressed, hopeless all the way to suicidal, so it's not something anymore like, "You know, I was bullied when I was a kid." I remember some girl followed me home one day, she was gonna, as you say, kick my butt, okay, and it wasn't fun, it was humiliating and it was horrible. It lasted about 30 minutes and then everybody forgot about and we moved on. Had that happened today, somebody would have videotaped it, they would have put it online, and I would still be dealing with that. So, it's not like it used to be, it's become so much worst that we can't really ignore it and just say this is a passing thing and as they grow up it will go away. It affects people for the rest of their lives, in many cases it affects the way people think about themselves. So we have to jump in and help. We can't just ignore it as a, ah, a passing fad for a kid. Yes. 

01:11:30
 Would it be helpful to do a suicide risk assessment? 

01:11:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS I think that is a great idea. And, and that goes back to her question what happens if it's getting even worse. Yeah, I think-- thank you for bringing that up. It's a great question. Yes. 

01:11:45
 I work in a school setting and she, she was very instant in all of this but I'm counting that a lot of times the students that's coming in crying cuz they'd been bullied are strictly not quite so innocent and she was and they'd play a large part in becoming the victim and, and, and more often bullying before it gets to the time where they're the ones being victimized. 

01:12:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Sure. 

01:12:05
 So, how do you think with a lot of those students who are kind of --and, and lot bullying victim but kind of bring it on themselves and continue to do so but still said they're being bullied? 

01:12:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Well, I think again, that, that's another reason why those mistaken goals are in here, is because at least if you believe in Adler, in what Adler, ah, contended and Dreikurs and his mistaken goals then by teaching them about those mistaken goals and spitting in their soup and saying, "This is really not getting you what you want," it's an educational process. Now, is that gonna happen overnight? Well, absolutely not. I-- it's not going to because probably kids like that have learned it at home and they're coming to you, they're being bullied at home and they're perpetuating the cycle and I would highly recommend in a case like that if at all possible involve the entire family. Because you can work with the kid, work with the kid, work with the kid and although it helps a lot, they go back home into this toxic environment and it starts all over again because that cycle is happening at home. Okay. Uhm, so you can see here that this does cause a lot of problems for the kids and it's not something that's quick. Okay, go to the next slide please. 

01:13:20
Background â–º Cyberbullying affects the entire family system (Froeschle, Crews, & Li, 2011) The Theory â€¢ Students need to feel connected, capable, courageous, and that they count (Kottman, 2003) â€¢ Students are striving to meet mistaken goals of power, attention, revenge, inadequacy) (Dreikurs & Stoltz, 1990) â€¢ Student needs esteem building and can be shown strengths leading to self-efficacy/success through complimenting (De Jong & Berg, 2002; Froeschle, Crews, & Li, 2011). â€¢ Students must overcome the need for revenge, cope with grief, and other emotions (Froeschle & Riney, 2008) Problem â–º Kottman-Adlerian (2003) â–º Complimenting-deShazer (1988) & Berg â–º Empathy, genuineness, respect-Rogers â–ºDreikurs-Color Activity (Froeschle, 2006) â–º Anger Sandwich (Froeschle, 2014). Strategy per research/theory 

01:13:20
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And again we're talking about the whole family system. This does affect the whole family system. All right, here's the theory I wanted to just tell you a little bit about some of the words you heard me using this were connected, capable, courageous, and we wanted the kids to know that they count. That comes from, if you're not familiar with that, read about Terry Kottman. She uses this in play therapy, this is the whole premise in Adlerian play therapy is the crucial Cs. And then, of course, students are striving to meet mistaken goals of power, attention, revenge, and inadequacy and this is particularly true when they have become bullies themselves. Uhm, that comes from Adler and Dreikurs. And then, uhm, students need self-esteem building and can be shown strengths heading to, ah, leading to self-efficacy and success through complimenting and you probably heard a lot of the solution focused techniques. I'm a huge believer specially when we're dealing with bullying that they are so beaten down that the complimenting-- I mean, it is amazing that when I sit down and I work kids who are so beaten down because they'd been bullied, that the first compliment you give them and their posture changes. And you gu-- are you familiar with that? Yeah. I ha-- I have seen that so many times because we don't live in world where we run around telling each other how wonderful we are, unfortunately, I wish we did. We should. But we don't. We live in a world-- I call it the kicking when you're down society. We wonder how come everybody's depressed, everybody's down but how many times do we go at somebody and go, "You know what? I really admire you." We think it but we don't tell people that. How many times on your job evaluation do they call you in and tell you everything that they love about you? Most of the time they tell you, "I want you to improve in this area." So, we don't live in a society where we tell people all the good things about them, we tell people all the negatives. Kids are no different. I was a school counselor for many years and I remember going to the door of the school and there was a kid who came in the front door wearing red shoelaces and he immediately got screamed up because he had red shoelaces. I was so appalled because I, being the counselor, knew that he was up all night because his family are gang members and that there were bullets going over his head all night long and that kid managed to wake up and get his clothes on and get himself to school. And what he should have heard is, "You made it to school. I am so proud of you. You are amazing," and he didn't. He walked in and all he heard about was red shoelaces, you're going to end school suspension. As counselors, we need to change that mentality. Kids really need complimenting that's why they bully each other. They just, as Adler said, we're all striving not to be inferior and they are striving not to be inferior. They wanna be superior in one way or another and if we don't make them inferior by complimenting them, they'll fuse the mistaken goals to try and get there. 

01:16:25
Goals â–º Reduce hurt and build esteem â–º Reduce need for revenge â–º Instill Internet safety skills â–º Understand and cope with feelings of grief, loss, embarrassment, fear, anger, etc. â–º Replace mistaken goals with social interest and feelings of being connected, courageous, capable, and feeling like she counts â–º Parent education â–º Adolescent's education 

01:16:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Right. Some of the other things that you, ah,-- some of the goals that we were going to, ah, get through in this session, we we're going to reduce hurt and build esteem, reduce the need for revenge, with the parents we be-- and with the student as well, internet safety skills. We live in a day and age where kids have absolutely no idea about privacy or confidentiality, they post everything in their life on the we-- the web or a blog or so we-- where else do they gonna learn about that from us. We ne-- we teach that, we can stop some of this. We need to help them cope with feelings of grief, loss, embarrassment, fear, and anger. And we need to replace those mistaken goals with social interest and feelings of being connected, courageous, capable, and feeling like they count. I am a huge believer in what Adler said about social interest. I think Adler was way, way before his time. I think that social interest, just like Adler did, is truly what makes people mentally healthy. I think that when you have kids that our down on themselves, people are making fun of them like with bullying and they realize that they do make a difference in the world even for just one other person, it can change the way they view the world, it can change the way they view themselves and it can change the fact that they don't realize they have any allies. Uhm, parents need educating and adolescents need educating about the mistaken goals and about the internet. 

01:18:05
Today's session â–º 1) Build rapport (empathy, complimenting, paraphrasing, etc.) â–º 2) Identify and Express Emotions (Miracle Questions; Anger Sandwich) â–º 3) Synthesize feelings & experience/Educate about Mistaken Goals (Social Aggression Art Activity) â–º 4) Coping Strategies; (Capable, Count, Connected, Courageous, Social Interest, Exceptions) â–º 5) Feedback Steps â–º Solution Focused, Rogerian â–º Adlerian, Dreikurs â–º Psychoeducational information giving Imbedded Theories 

01:18:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS All right, here's what I did in today's session. Uhm, the first thing I did was just built rapport through empathy, complimenting, paraphrasing, exceptions and so forth and all of that was either solution focused or Rogerian. The next thing I did was I identified and help to express her emotions by drawing them on the paper, you heard the miracle question. I did not use the thing called the anger sandwich but I'll tell you what it is. The anger sandwich is usually for younger kids. A lot of times when you do this with younger kids, all they could say is, "I'm angry," and they don't understand that anger comes from hurt. So, it's like a sandwich and you can have him make a sandwich with playdough or d-- draw a sandwich because the anger is the bread but all of these other emotions are bottled up in the middle. So, I have to make an anger sandwich so that we can talk about this. Older kids, you can have and do like Elizabeth did and just draw them on the paper and talk about them. The third thing I, I did with Elizabeth is I had her synthesize her feelings and experience by educating her about mistaken goals and that's where I had her do the art where she was, ah, the art where she was drawing herself doing something. 

01:19:25
Today's session â–º 1) Build rapport (empathy, complimenting, paraphrasing, etc.) â–º 2) Identify and Express Emotions (Miracle Questions; Anger Sandwich) â–º 3) Synthesize feelings & experience/Educate about Mistaken Goals (Social Aggression Art Activity) â–º 4) Coping Strategies; (Capable, Count, Connected, Courageous, Social Interest, Exceptions) â–º 5) Feedback Steps â–º Solution Focused, Rogerian â–º Adlerian, Dreikurs â–º Psychoeducational information giving Imbedded Theories 

01:19:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS And then I had her talk about some coping strategies that she had using the cruc-- Adlerian crucial Cs, the Terry Kottman advocates, capable, count, connected, courageous, social-- involving social interest and using some exceptions from, ah, solution focused embedded with the Adlerian techniques to tell me what had already been working for her. And then finally, I gave her feedback. Can you remember with solution focused how we give feedback? We-- first, we compliment and then we have that bridge, and then we have the task of what we'd like them to do for the next week. So you heard me do that where I complimented her on everything I thought she had done well and then I agreed with her that her grades needed to improve and so forth. That was the, the bridge and then the task were the things that she had already told me were working with her plus the social interest plus the experiential activity. Did anyone wonder why I did that weird activity at the end? What that was about? Why would I want her to pretend that everything was going well? Yeah. It was because I wanted her to know, you know, this session is called empowering, that's very empowering when you go out there and you actually do that. I don't know if any of you have ever done that. Try it. You're gonna find out that you're empowered, you really do control the way you respond to things and you learn that really fast if you'll actually do it. So, that's a very empowering technique that kids can come back and tell you about the next week if you can get them to actually do it. Okay. Keep going. 

01:21:00
Steps that Occur for about 7 Weeks â–º 1) Building Rapport â–º 2) Identify and Express Emotions (i.e. anger, grief, hurt, frustration) â–º 3) Tie feeling to experience/Educate â–º 4) Coping and Problem Solving Strategies â–º 5) Immediate Coping and Self Control Strategies â–º 6) Psychoeducation â–º 7) Social Interest â–º Steps 1) empathy, complimenting â–º 2) Miracle question, anger sandwich â–º 3) Dreikurs mistaken goals â–º 4) Exception questions, feedback â–º 5) Thought stopping, relaxation, and imagery, feedback â–º 6) Online safety, bullying â–º 7) Feedback Strategies 

01:21:05
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Okay, now, uhm, like I told you. This is about a seven-week program and so I'm gonna tell you the things you did not see. Uhm, the coping and problem solving strategies, we're gonna talk a little about. Ah, the grief that you didn't see, we're also gonna talk about the difference between long term coping and short term coping because there is a difference. I mean, she can come up with all the strategies in the world that say, "I'm gonna talk to my mom," but when mom is not there and math class is fixed in to start in five minutes, she's gonna need some coping mechanisms to help her in the next five minutes to get to class and we didn't have time to do that but that is something that you would do in the next sessions. 

01:21:45
Steps that Occur for about 7 Weeks â–º 1) Building Rapport â–º 2) Identify and Express Emotions (i.e. anger, grief, hurt, frustration) â–º 3) Tie feeling to experience/Educate â–º 4) Coping and Problem Solving Strategies â–º 5) Immediate Coping and Self Control Strategies â–º 6) Psychoeducation â–º 7) Social Interest â–º Steps 1) empathy, complimenting â–º 2) Miracle question, anger sandwich â–º 3) Dreikurs mistaken goals â–º 4) Exception questions, feedback â–º 5) Thought stopping, relaxation, and imagery, feedback â–º 6) Online safety, bullying â–º 7) Feedback Strategies 

01:21:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You're gonna have a psychoeducational piece for her and for mom and you're gonna help her get some kinda social interest set up over the next few weeks. You're gonna have online safety, you're gonna have a little bit of information about bullying so she knows what's happening to her, we may implement some thought stopping. She said she was able to just shut her computer and walk away. I would delve a little bit more into that, okay, I didn't have time to do that up here today but that's immediately what's going t-- through my head as, "Hmm, what are you thinking that's helping you to be able to do that?" So those of you that like cognitive, there is a piece of that in there. So, one thing I love about solution focused is it has pretty much every theory already embedded into it so you can say, "I'm using solution focused," and pretty much you can be using anything. Uhm, so again we're gonna continue with more of the exception questions to feedback and more of what you saw up here, some of the other things that we did. Okay. All right, I wanted you to think for just a minute and we only have a couple of minutes left. 

01:22:50
Case Study â–º Casey is a 13 year old male who attends 8th grade classes at his local middle school. Casey is referred to you by his parents because they believe he is being cyber-bullied. What are some behaviors you might see that reinforce the parents' suspicions? What are some emotions Casey might be experiencing? How would you address these emotions? What would you include in sessions? 

01:22:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS But pretend that Casey is a 13-year-old male who attends eighth grade classes at his locall middle school. Casey is referred to you by his parents because they believe he is being cyber-bullied. What are some of the behaviors that you might see that reinforce the parents' suspicions and what are some emotions Casey might be experiencing? How would you address these emotions and what would you include in your sessions? Tell me, for Casey, what would you do that maybe I did not already talk about? I know some of you in here are the real experts so... Is it gonna matter the type of bullying that Casey is experiencing? You know, there are several different types of cyberbullying. You could be being-- there's cyberstalking, there's cyberthreats, there's denigration. Would any of that matter with how you would handle it? You're saying-- yes. Tell me what your thought are on that. 

01:24:00
 I guess, partly, ah, I've had kids that were stalked by-- and adults and they start the bullying pretending to be the kids. 

01:24:10
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. That's a different situation. It's a very different situation. 

01:24:10
 You know and, and that's why they're dealing with some of the emotions that they're experiencing that where you may have to have a conversation with, ah, with Casey if that's really is about, uhm, the help that he might need to handle this situation. 

01:24:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Right. And, and we may even have to involve law enforcement if it turns into be some kind of stalking case like what you're describing there as well. So, there are a lot, uhm, a lot of sources out there to help you with this and I have some handouts before you leave, I will get you a handout that has some sources on it that also has an outline of today's session. I didn't have an opportunity to set that out ahead of time so before you leave I will be at the back door and I will hand you one of those. But before I let you go, any other questions or comments or any suggestions for people in here. Maybe you've done something. 

01:25:10
 First, ah, I like to thank Elizabeth for being willing to and courageous. 

01:25:15
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Let's give her a hand. Thank you. 

01:25:20
 Ah, and some of what I ask was would be in regard to, ah, ah, cases where the individual, ah, you've talked about a different gender here but, ah, culture and gender - 

01:25:30
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Uh-hmm. 

01:25:30
 - can have a difference - 

01:25:35
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Absolutely. 

01:25:35
 - with regard to, ah, what one might do with the extensiveness. Some people are not very verbal particularly, - 

01:25:40
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Thank you. 

01:25:40
 - some kids aren't then, particularly some, ah, cultures. 

01:25:45
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS Yes. 

01:25:45
 I just wonder how you, ah, get there if there's more of play therapy or art there be involved in that process. 

01:25:50
JANET FROESCHLE HICKS You-- rather than-- and, and we didn't do as much of that because we were on the clock in here but you could actually instead of me asking, "What have you done that's work for, for you?" Ins-- I could have had her draw that. Every single one of those things as a picture and done that more as play therapy. Cuz the truth is if we do play therapy it doesn't really matter if I know what it means as long as she knows what it means. She can take that with her. That's, ah,-- thank you very much for sharing that. That's very great. Very great thought about that. All right, well, I'm gonna get go those handouts. Thank you so much for being here.
