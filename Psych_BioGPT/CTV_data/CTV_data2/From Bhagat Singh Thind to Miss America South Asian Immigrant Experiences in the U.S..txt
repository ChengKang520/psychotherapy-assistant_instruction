DR. ARPANA INMAN Michael, thank you so much for that, um, introduction. It's a real pleasure to be here, today. Um, thanks to Dr. Mavel for having me here, as an invited speaker. I was just sharing with her, this morning, that, um, I've been coming to this conference since I was a student in late '90's, um, so, it's really a nice, nice, great pleasure to be here, because I feel that this has been a home to me, uh, and I come here almost every year if I am able to. Uh, I don't think I've really missed any, uh, meetings here, so, thank you for having me here. Um, in keeping with the theme of the conference, uh, I thought I would talk a little bit about the political involvement of the South Asian community with regard to issues of discrimination, uh, and racism. It's an area that, typically, is not addressed as much, it's not discussed as much, um, within the larger area of multi-cultural counseling, but also within the South Asian community, itself, there's not as much attention to this, and hopefully, as I talk a little bit about this, you'll get a flavor of perhaps why, uh, there's a little bit of a hesitance to address some of these issues, but, as I was researching a little bit for this talk, uh, today, I was pleasantly surprised to see that there have been some important strides made, and I'm hoping that we'll continue to do that. Um...

00:03:35
DR. ARPANA INMAN So, I thought I'd start off, first, with, uh, just telling a little bit about the immigration history. I'm gonna walk you through about three decades of immigration history, along with talking a little bit about the different pivotal moments that happened in the South Asian immigration, um, with regard to experience of discrimination - how people have addressed this particular aspect. So, if you look at the initial immigration, there really was a sprinkling of immigration in the late 1700's to 1900's. Um, if you look to see the census in 1900's was about 2,000 Indians in the United States, and we don't quite clearly know who these Indians were, what part of India they came from. Um, it's, it's not very clear, in some ways, but the real first significant presence in the United States was the Punjabi's, um, from India - the Sikhs. Um, and essentially, they came here between 1904 and 1920, and they came here because of drought in India, but also, at that time, as you may know, the British had colonized India, and so, um, there were some tenure, land-tenure issues going on, which weren't serving the Punjabi community there. And so, they decided to leave and come to British Columbia. Uh, but because of racist experiences in British Columbia, they moved south, to the United States, to Washington. And they were, they kind of settled in Bellingham and Everett, working in lumber mills and also railroad construction. It was a fairly small community of Sikhs at that time, and so they kind of kept to themselves quite a bit, um, kind of being involved in their own ethnic traditions and cultural traditions. Um, at this time, the local community was very suspicious of this quote, unquote, 'alien' culture, um, and 'alien' community. And, the other thing that really kind of triggered things for the local community, um, was that these, this, these , this community served as, um, cheap labor, and so, the local groups - the white, organized groups - uh, like the Asian, uh, League, uh, Asiatic League, actually, Exclusion League, uh, that was formed, um, had a lot of, uh, launched a lot of racist acts on the local community. Uh, primarily because, not only were they alien, but they were taking away jobs from the local community. Um, this was in 1907, and, essentially, what happened at that time was people started talking about barring Indians from being in the United States. After the Punjabi's, came, came Asi-, Indian students. Now, this was a very different population that came to the United States. Um, most of them came here as students, but, a, a large segment of them were political dissenters, and these individuals were advocating for independence for India, and, in San Francisco, they formed the Ghadr party, in 1913. The goal was to liberate India from the British rule. Now, what is interesting at this time, was the United States got involved with the first World War, and this actually sealed the fate of the Ghadr movement. What is happening at this time was they felt and there was a lot of pressure from the British government, onto the US government, to suppress and prosecute members of the Ghadr movement, and that's exactly what the US government did, because they were concerned and thinking that the Ghadr movement was aligning with the Germans at that time, but it was also kind of another ploy from the British to kind of say, you know, "We, we're not able to have the sovereignty that we need in India, and so, you kind of need to help us." So, it really kind of stifled the movement, um, the political movement, and it was quite a setback. It was around the same time that the Barred Zone Act of 1917 was put forth, which, essentially, cut all immigration from India to the United States. So, immigration's very static at this time and racism was being fought on two fronts. One was from the farmers, who were not as literate, and then, there were the Indians, students, who were coming in, educated, or getting education here, who were fight, uh, both of them fighting for civil rights and fighting against discrimination. It was also at this time that the United States, um, was not allowing ethnic communities to marry US citizens. So, the farmers were getting married to Mexicans, um, there were some Indians, uh, educated Indians a=, according to the literature, and I think this is kind of a mixed data, there. Some folks say that, um, Indians were really not marrying white Americans, but then there's some other literature that says that there was some inter-marriage going on. But essentially, both are fighting for the same rights.

See-Saw Battle for Citizenship *Naturalized constituted "White" or "Caucasian" change on public mood *US vs. Balsara (1910) & A. Kumar Mazumdar (1913) declared "Caucasian" and hence eligible for citizenship (some reprieve for Indians) *Bhagat Singh Thind (1923): law was reversed with Indians not being see as free White persons; *citizenship for over 45-50 Indian citizens' revoked *1913, amended 1920-21: The Alien Land Act of California (initially against Japanese & Chinese) now applied to Indians *Census showed dramatic drop in Asian Indian populations in the US 

00:08:30
DR. ARPANA INMAN Then you come to c-, uh, citizenship. And what is happening, was there seemed to be sort of like a see-saw of, um, the battle for citizenship. What it meant to be, in terms of being a nationalized citizen, was that you had to be white, in a sense, Caucasian. However, what constituted white, really changed based on the public mood. So, at one time, we have a few Indians who, um, applied to citizenship, like Balsara and Mazumdar, and, they did get citizenship. So, this is some kind of a reprieve for Indians, especially given the Barred Zone Act, that had been put forth fairly recently. But then we have Bhagat Singh Thind, who came to the United States. He had a Ph.D. in, uh, metaphysics. He was lecturing a lot in spirituality, and, uh, a Sikh man, came in and basically was denied citizenship. There was an assumption that he was part of the Ghadr movement and he was aligning with the Germans, and that was the reasoning behind why he wasn't gonna get citizenship. It was interesting, even at this time, that when he was denied citizenship, those other Indians, 45 to 50 Indians who were here, their citizenship was revoked. 

00:09:45

00:09:45
See-Saw Battle for Citizenship *Naturalized constituted "White" or "Caucasian" change on public mood *US vs. Balsara (1910) & A. Kumar Mazumdar (1913) declared "Caucasian" and hence eligible for citizenship (some reprieve for Indians) *Bhagat Singh Thind (1923): law was reversed with Indians not being see as free White persons; *citizenship for over 45-50 Indian citizens' revoked *1913, amended 1920-21: The Alien Land Act of California (initially against Japanese & Chinese) now applied to Indians *Census showed dramatic drop in Asian Indian populations in the US 

00:09:45
DR. ARPANA INMAN We also have the Alien Land Act of California, which initially was instituted to not grant land to Japanese and Chinese, was later applied to the Indian population as well - specifically, the Punjabi community, coming here, in terms of agriculture. Um, that, that was kind of their means for survival. So what we see is a real drop in census, um, during that time, for the Asian population. 

00:10:15

00:10:15
Fight for Citizenship *1930's: Indian Welfare League and Indian League of Americans renewed efforts for citizenship while fighting to increase support for Indian independence *Asian Indians embolden by Atlantic Charter (1941) *sought to impress upon US government the importance of Indian assistance in preventing formation of the Japanese-German alliance in Asia *Essentially saying that US could not ask India to fight on their behalf while not allowing them to live in the US. 

00:10:15
Luce-Celler Bill (1946) *Indian lobbying led by J.J. Singh (a Sikh merchant) resulted in Congressional approval of *act of July 2, 1946 *gave Indians right to naturalization and also allowed a small number of Indian spouses, minor children to enter the US each year. *1948-1965: 7000 Indians emigrated to the US; 1780 who were American residents acquired citizenship 

00:10:15
Significant phase of political history *`965: immigration and Naturalization Act: 20,000 immigrants from each country ^based on American "social engineering" migration policies *Educated professionals, skilled labor with US civil rights already in place 

00:10:15
Questioning Self-Representation *1975: 175,000 Indians *Aryan, Indo-Aryan, Caucasian, Oriental, Indian, Asian, Mongol, and Dravidian *Nomenclature of "Hindu" abandoned *Asian American reflect more of the experience of those from the Far East *Aversion to be viewed as part of the "Black" community *While category of "White" was more desirable, Indians could not claim this due to being members of a "minority group" due to experiences of prejudice *A greater desire to dissociate from "White" identity *Embraced the racial designation of "Model Minority" 

00:10:15
DR. ARPANA INMAN However, the fight for citizenship seemed to continue. So in 1930's, the Indian Welfare League and the Indian League of Americans renewed efforts to work for getting citizenship for Indians. Um, it was at this time that the Asian Indians were also emboldened by the Atlantic Charter, which basically suggests, or says, that people have a right to self-government. And so, they were seeking to impress upon the US government that they really needed India's help at this time, um, during the war, to make sure that they would prevent any kind of alliance between Japanese and Germans, uh, in Asia. But essentially what they're saying is if we ask Indians for their help, in this, in this process, we can't really tell them not to live in the US, and that's kind of what they were talking about. Around the same time, a lit-, we have J.J. Singh, another Sikh man, who lobbies, very strongly, in Congress, um, for citizenship and for the rights for naturalization, and that's when we have the Luce-Celler Bill, in 1946, which gives Indians a right to naturalization. It was also at this time that a lot of people came in with their spouses and a small number of children came in, as well. So, between '48 and '65, we have about 7,000 Indians immigrate to the US. We have 1,780 individuals who are, as residents, acquiring citizenship. Now, a real significant time that things really shifted for the Indian community was in 1965, when Immigration and Naturalization Act was put forth, which allowed a code, which created a code or system for different countries to come here, and about 20,000 people could come here, to the United States, and so Indians and South Asians were also able to come. I keep using the word 'Indians,' because, initially, a large number of the people who came here were Indians, or people from India, but we certainly have a large number of people from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh. Uh, it's not as high, but it's st-, I hope, it's hopefully going to be increasing. Um, but, a lot of the immigration that happened at this time was really the social engineering of ma-, migration policies by, by the United, uh, the US, uh, government, in terms of making sure that they got skilled labor, they got people who were educated, so the population of Indians that came at this time were very different. Um, these individuals had civil rights already, so they didn't really have to fight for anything at this time. So, in 17-, 1975, we have about 175,000 Indians in the United States. Now, given the large number of people here, certainly a question of self-representation comes up. "How do I identify? Wh-, what do I call myself? What do I have others call me? Or, how do I, how am I seen by others?" And so, there were a lot of words that were kind of thrown around and tossed around and used, such as Aryan, Indo-Aryan, Caucasian, Oriental, Indian, Asian, Mongol, and Dravidian. Interesting, the word "Hindu" was abandoned, and the wor-, the way it's spelled H-I-N-D-U, um, currently, was actually spelled as H-I-N-D-O-O, previously. Uh, but that, that, uh, terminology was abandoned, rightfully so, because the lot of religious, different religious communities in India, and so, really, it's important to represent everybody. The word, the terminology Asian-American didn't really fit. The Indian community felt it was more aligned with people from the Far East, kind of Southeast Asia and East Asia, and there was an aversion to kind of identify with black, given the discrimination that was going on to, towards black people, in this country. Now, interestingly, the category for white was very desirable, certainly because of the privileges that accorded to that particular designation, but Indians, really, couldn't identify that way, because they are a minority, darker skinned, experience prejudice - they were seen as a minority - and so, they really couldn't align with that. So, there was a desire, at this time, to dissociate from white identity, but interestingly, a desire to internalize the "Model Minority," um, identification.

00:14:35
Owning the designation "Asian Indian" *1975: Association of Indians in American submitted written statement to U.S. Civil Rights Commission about distinctive appearance and prejudices *efforts led to reclassification of immigrant Indians as "Asian Indians" in the Census Bureau. *Cost of owning designation 

00:14:35
Case for disadvantage *The two subsequent decades (i.e., 1980s and 1990s) - shift in the type of immigrants. *Not as highly educated and from lower socioeconomic status, these individuals were relatives of these who had immigrated in the post-1965 wave *Unemployment rates 5 times higher than other Asian groups *Although several were professionals, large number now in working class jobs (taxi drivers, gas station owners, subway newsagent vendors) being brunt of racial prejudice and ethnic jokes 

00:14:35
A Violent Turn *1980's racism acquired a systematic pattern *Dot Busters: A number of Indians with significant material success were murdered by young white men who came to be known as "Dot Busters" - reference to the bindi placed on Hindu women's foreheads. 

00:14:35
Urgency to address Discrimination *Formation of several professional organizations to enhance and safeguard Indian interests: *American Association of Physicians from India (AAPI), Association of Indians in America (AIA), Federation of Indian American Association (FIA), National Association of Americans of Asian Indian Descent(NAAAID), Indian American Forum for Political Education (IAFPD) 

00:14:35
Organizing... *1985: The NFIA, together with the American Indian Forum for Political Education and AAPI, fought against proposed legislation that would cut Medicare funding to hospitals employing doctors with foreign medical degrees. *1987: The NFIA was also to show the way in how Asian Indians might further the interests of the Indian nation-state, when it mobilized the Indian community with apparent success, to persuade Congress to withdraw the sale of sophisticated AWACS planes to Pakistan 

00:14:35
1990: South Asian Network *Forum to discuss social, economic, political issues affecting community awareness, engagement, and advocacy. *Civil Rights Unit (CRU) *Organizing from the ground up within South Asian Community *Community Health Action Initiative (CHAI) *Adopting healthier lifestyles *1992: South Asian Magazine for Action and Reflection (SAMAR) *Promote social and economic justice 

00:14:35
DR. ARPANA INMAN In 1975, given the large population in the United States, that there was a push to look at s-, self-designation, look at how it, Indians were being designated in the US census, and the Association of Indians in American, um, they submitted a written statement to the US Civil Rights Commission, asking for a different designation, because they kind of talked about the fact that they were very different, in terms of their appearance. They're experiencing prejudice, and that's when the designation of "Asian Indians" came about in the census. But there's certainly a cost to owning different kinds of designations, um, whether it's "Model Minority," whether it's "Asian Indian," and it certainly played out, and has played out for the Indian community and the South Asian community. Now, subsequent to the 1965 immigration, we have two other sets of immigration happening in the 80's and 90's that were significant, and there was a shift in the type of immigration that happened at this time. So, we have people coming who have fam-, who are family members of those who immigrated in the '65, um, but they were from lower socioeconomic status - they were not as highly educated. They, oftentimes, held working class jobs, such as taxi drivers, gas station owners, subway newsagent vendors, um, and the, and unemployment was five times higher for this community than for other Asian communities. They also experienced a lot of racial prejudice and ethnic jokes cast upon them. But in 1980, there was a real turn to what happened with, um, the Asian Indian community. There was a violent turn to racism, and some of you may be aware of this, in 1980, there was a group called 'Dot Busters' in north Jersey. They were a group of white individuals - white men - who essentially called themselves 'Dot Busters' based on the bindi, or the dot, that Hindu women have on their forehead. And, they were upset that a lot of Indians were taking away jobs from the local community, and so, a lot of the Indians who were successful, um, were murdered. This certainly raised awareness of discrimination. This was one pivotal time, again, that discrimination kind of came to the forefront for the Indian community, the South Asian community, and there was a formation of several professional organizations, um, to h-, kind of safeguard Indian interests. So, we have several organization: The American Association of Physicians from India, Association of Indians in America, Federation of Indian American Associations, National Federation, uh, Ame-, National Association of Americans of Asian Indian Descent, and the Indian American Forum for Political Education. In 1985, the National Federation for Indian American Association, together with the American Indian Forum for Political Education, APPI, which is the one for the Physicians, um, fought against proposed legislative cuts regarding Medicare - specifically, in places, in hospitals where they were hiring foreigners with medical degrees. They wanted to make sure these individuals are gonna be reimbursed. Uh, in '87, the same organization, uh, mobilized Indian communities with regard to persuading the Congress to withdraw sale of sophisticated planes to Pakistan. So, you see that there's a certain level of, uh, political activism going on within the Asian community. In the 1990's, we have the South Asian Network formed, and here we have a forum that allows people to have discussions related to racism, advocacy, community engagement, awareness, etc., and within that, we have the Civil Rights Unit, which, kind of focused on organizing from the ground up. We also have CHAI, which c-, came about around the same time, focusing on healthier lifestyles for South Asians. In 1992, we have SAMAR, which is the South Asian Magazine for Action and Reflection, again, focusing on promoting social and economic justice. 

00:18:45
9/11: government policies restricting civil liberties *Patriot Act and Special Registration Program *FBI surveillance, investigations *Detentions and deportations *Hostile work environments *Tenant Evictions *Restrictions to health and human services *Wrongful job terminations 

00:18:45
*greater introspection of what it meant to be Indian American in the U.S. *Idea that hard work, a good education, substantial income would lead to automatic acceptance was shaken with South Asians were suddenly viewed with suspicion and some, Sikhs in particular, because targets of discrimination* *Had "a sobering effect" on community that assimilation would be smooth. 

00:18:45
2000 *Alliance of South Asians Taking Action (ASATA) *immigration fraud, trafficking, violence, oppression, racism, exploitation within and against the community *South Asian American Leading Together (SAALT) *Leadership, policy analysis, advocacy, community education, civil-immigration laws, hate-crimes *Bay Area Solidarity Summer *Summer Political Action Training Camp *South Asian Progressive Action Collective *Discussion of political and social issues (combating racism, deportation, loss of civil rights) 

00:18:45
*2008: *Alliance of South Asian American Labor *Promote political involvement, voter registration, activism *South Asian Youth Action (SAYA) *NY based desk club 

00:18:45
Shooting in Wisconsin *Mass shooting at a Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin *Occurred 10:30 a.m. when temple members were reading scriptures and cooking food in preparation for the main Sunday service and community lunch *6 people die in a weekend rampage *Members of our own community attended to the needs of both this community as well as the professional community through education and service 

00:18:45
Indian American is Miss America (2013) *Twitter messages *And the Arab wins Miss America. Classic - how the f*** does a foreigner win Miss America? *Miss New York is an Indian. With all do respect, this is America *9/11 was 4 days ago and she gets miss America? - nice slap in the face to the people of 9-11 how pathetic *Congratulations Al Qaeda. Our Miss America is one of you - More like Miss Terrorist *Miss America? You mean Miss 7-11 *Darn. I wish Miss Kansas would've won! Real American woman!! 

00:18:50
DR. ARPANA INMAN And then we have 9/11. When 9/11 happened, there were a lot of government policies that restricted civil liberties, and this was particularly true for South Asians in this country, and this was because of the Patriot Act and Special Regulations Program, Registration Program. There was an increase in FBI surveillance, investigations, detentions and deportations, hostile work environments, wrongful job terminations, tenant e-, evictions, and restrictions to health and human services. Certainly at this time there was a lot of introspection on part of Asian Indians and South Asians in particular, kind of wondering what it meant to be South Asian in America, in the United States. The idea that hard work, good education, substantial income would be protective factors didn't really fly here. It, it had kind of a sobering effect on this community, suddenly realizing that, you know, they're not really safe, even if they have all those other factors in place. We have other kinds of organizations developing around the same time. We have the Alliance of South Asians Taking Action, the, they focus on immigration fraud, trafficking, oppression, racism, exploitation within and against the community. We have the South Asian American Leading Together (SAALT), focusing on leadership, policy analysis, hate crimes, uh, and they did a lot of work post-9/11 to really highlight a lot of the deportation and hate crimes that were going on for the South Asian community. We have the Bay Area Solidarity Summer program, which is geared towards the youth, really highlighting and teaching, uh, training youths for political action, which I think is a wonderful thing. Uh, South Asian Progressive Action Collective, which is a discussion of political and social issues, combating racism, de-, deportation, and loss of civil rights. So, you can certainly see that there's a lot of movement going on, but again, it was in certain segments that we've had a lot of organizations in, uh, the Bay Area, we had a few. In Chicago, we have a few, in New York. The Alliance of South Asian American Labor, promoting political involvement, voter registration, activism. Um, and then the Youth Action, here, which is based right here in New York. Um, but despite all this, they still seem to be incidences that have happened, and certainly, highlight again, the experiences of South Asians and again, it, it's curious to see, kind of, how this community has mobilized with regard to these issues. Um, you certainly are aware of the shooting in Wisconsin. This happened about 12 days, right after the shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Uh, interestingly, uh, just looking at the news, and as I was kind of reading through different articles to prepare for this, there was a lot more written about the shooting in Colorado, than there was about this particular incident in Wisconsin. There was a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Occurred at 10:30 A.M. when temple members were reading scriptures, cooking food in preparation for the main Sunday service. Six people died in this weekend rampage. We've had a lot of our own community members, within the counseling field, um, advocating and really educating us about this community. People like Anneliese Singh, um, (inaudible), and, uh, Pu-, Puni Kalra, who've done a lot of good work in this area, really kind of, uh, also wrote a lot of articles and educated our community to kind of think a little bit more about what is happening, with regard to the South Asian community - in particular, the Sikhs. And then we have Miss America last year. The first Indian American becomes Miss America. You may have read the Twitter messages. "And the Arab wins Miss America. Classic - How the F does a foreigner win Miss America?" "Miss New York is an Indian. With all due respect, this is America." "9/11 was 4 days ago and she gets miss America? - nice s-, slap in the face to the people of 9/11 how pathetic" "Congratulations Al Qaeda. Our Miss America is one of you - More like Miss Terrorist" "Miss America? You mean Miss 7-11?" "Darn. I wish Miss Kansas would've won! Real American woman!"

Today , 2,843,391 Asian Indians reside in the U.S. representing 20% of total Asian population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010) *A reticence to address discrimination *How one anchors one's identity may be key to how experiences are negotiated *Racial discrimination and minority status identification contributes to acculturative stress for this community *Radical identity a mediating variable in relationship between racism related stress and self-esteem, and racism related stress and collectivistic coping 

00:23:25
DR. ARPANA INMAN Today we have over two million Asian Indians residing in the United States - make up about 20 percent of the total Asian American population, and yet, what's interesting, is that there's a reticence to address issues of discrimination in this community, despite all of these different incidences have ever happened and every time these large incidences happen, it's, it heightens the awareness of being a minority. And I think what's important to think about is how we experience ourselves, or how we negotiate different experiences, really depends on how we identify. And it'll be curious, and I think this is part of something that, I've certainly been doing this, so have my colleagues who are kind of trying to look at this in terms of the experience of racism, and I'm gonna share a little bit about a recent study that I conducted with my colleagues. But, certainly, despite what is there would we talked about, what I shared with you, from the minimal research that exists, we know that racial discrimination, minority status, contr-, uh, identification certainly contributes to stress in this community. What we also have found is that racial identity is a mediating variable in relationship to race related stress and self-esteem and collectivistic coping. So certainly, I think, the identification of being a racial minority, something that's important, something that's important to address and look at in this community.

00:24:55
DR. ARPANA INMAN So, here is some research I did with a few of my colleagues, um, recently. And we looked at 50 South Asian, primarily Asian Indians, uh, in the United States. We interviewed them in, in a context of a focus group. There were participants from Michigan to Wiscon-, uh, to, um, Washington DC, um, so we had quite a range in terms of the Northeast section. And, what we found is that these, the Indian Americans, today, are very aware of the risk factors related to racism. They recognize that their physical appearance, the growing visibility, the lack of assimilation, and they're talking a lot about accents. And also, not being able to always talk about things around the 'water cooler' so to speak, talking about TV shows, talking about football, which is really a part of the American culture. Um, and living in less diverse communities certainly highlighted the experience of discrimination. But interestingly, they also said education, skills, work ethic, professional competence were protective factors, but we know that those really aren't protective factors at least in the experience of South Asians, given some of the discriminatory experiences. So there's really a tension in terms of kind of handling and working with racism. There's a lot of ambiguity surrounding what racism is and how to address it. Um, there's a struggle to understand - a lot of people talked about feeling that there's a lot of subtlety in terms of what racism was, in terms of wondering if, and, we rationalize it a lot, saying, "Well, perhaps, I just had a bad experience that day." And that's why they said what they said, so they were talking a lot about micro-aggressions, but didn't really kind of connect it. The other piece that was interesting about this group, uh, and again, there's just 50 individuals, so we certainly need to kind of look at it in the context of those 50 individuals, rationalize in terms of a Karmic notion of discrimination, and what we found here, certainly is that while India has been colonized by the British and it has, they've been, Indians have been able to kind of fight that and move beyond that and own their own ethnic identity, the caste system, within India, certainly made, played a very big role. And they talked about the fact that, you know in India we discriminate against others based on caste. So, if we discriminate there, what comes around goes around. And that's kind of how they rationalized. Interestingly, was also a desire to align with, or be identified with the Jewish community. Um, and they said, you know, we really would like to be, we should be more like them in terms of their success - economic success, um, education, etc., but not one them spoke about the anti-Semitism that exists currently. SO, it's kind of interesting how there's a compartmentalization also of what they wanted to look at and what they chose to look at, um, with regard to the different communities. 

00:27:55
Diminishing Experience of Discrimination *Emphasis on individual factors or situational discrimination diminished the ability to contextualize the sociocultural, historical, and political milieu within which Asian Indians are located *Internalized model minority myth deflects racial discrimination or identifying with other racial minority 

00:27:55
Coping *Distancing *Hypothetical of happening to others using cognitive statements to describe *Generational Difference *Seeing second generation as more capable due to a lived US race based experience *Political Action *Talking directly addressing discrimination, having confidence and owning identity 

00:28:00
DR. ARPANA INMAN So there seem to be sort of a diminished sense or experience of what discrimination is. They focused a lot on individual factors and certainly India is a very interesting country with regard to a collectivistic focus, but there's also a great individualistic focus, and that certainly came through in the data, uh, with regard to looking at kind of individual factors that promote, um, success, and they really didn't look at the sociocultural, historical, and political issu-, uh, areas, or milieus in which Indians exist. Now, one of the questions we asked them, right in the beginning, is, to see if they were aware of the kinds of discrimination South Asians or Asian Indians have experienced in the United States, and they were able to talk about Dot Busters. They talked about, um, a couple other incidences certainly, but they didn't go back and talk about a history of what had happened with regard to immigration, with regard to citizenship, so that was kind of interesting. Certainly intel-, internalizing the model minority myth deflected them from identifying, um, with discrimination, but also deflected them from, distanced themselves from identifying with other racial minorities. With regard to coping, what is interesting is they certainly talked about the need for political action. They said it's important to talk, address things directly, have confidence, own your identity, but they also, in the way they talked, seemed to distance in the way they coped with discrimination. When they spoke about experiences, they were very hypothetical in the way they described incidences. Um, they talked about things happening to others, more so than themselves. Um, and they use rather cognitive statements, rather than, we would talk about the emotional impact that discrimination can have. So, they didn't really talk about any kind of emotionality, and that was kind of interesting, in terms of even talking about the experience of discrimination. The other piece that they talked about was the generational difference and - all of these are first generation indi-, uh, individuals - and they said, "For our children, it might be a little easier to deal with discrimination. They've grown up in this country. They've had a racialized experience. And so, it might be helpful, um, for, in fact, they also look to the children to help them, sometimes, deal with experiences of discrimination, but certainly felt that they were more equipped to deal with discrimination than the first generation were, because they didn't, uh, grow up here. But the other piece I that was kind of interesting was also that, they, when they talked about home, they talked about India as their home, and so, they didn't feel that, even though they were citizens here, they didn't feel that they were American. They said, "Well, you know, back home," or, "When I go back. At some point I might go back." And so, having India as a home, really allowed them to kind of distance themselves from this experience, as well. So, that's a little bit of the history and kind of where we are today, with regard to the experience of discrimination in the South Asian community. I'm gonna open it up to any questions you may have for me. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Sorry, this isn't well thought out - in my practice, I have, um, Asian Americans, member of the FIQ Union, who, actually, are treated really well in their - everybody who comes into my practice has had a problem, that's why they're sent there it's a legal problem, it's something else - but, um, they're, they return to work faster. They're aware of it. It would appear that their, uh, work ethic is all part of this, but as I watch them in group, with a bunch of other people, they're very cautious about being clear that they've returned to work and... 

00:31:55
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN So, my observation is their work ethic does help them against discrimination in their smallest work group... 

00:32:05
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN ...where the boss... 

00:32:05
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN ...wants to get the job done... 

00:32:10
DR. ARPANA INMAN Right. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN ...and wants them back on the job as soon as possible. But they seem to be aware of favoritism... 

00:32:20
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN ...and so they're cautious not to make it obvious. 

00:32:25
DR. ARPANA INMAN Right. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Is that sort of what you? 

00:32:25
DR. ARPANA INMAN Yeah. I, I think there's an awareness, certainly there's a sense of needing to protect themselves, uh, and certainly one of, the example that you gave of things that came up in the focus groups, as well. Um, and one of the things when they talked about is the need to have these dialogues. Um, they, the, the situation is that South Asians don't often have these kinds of spaces to talk about these issues. They experience it, but they kind of just push it away. Um, and so, the need to kind of be engaged in some kind form of activism or to recognize that these things happen need to be, uh, need to be looked at is minimized in some ways - certainly part of it is a protective factor based on maybe their immigration status, um, as well as the fact that there's a recognition of being a minority. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Again, I, there are three gentlemen I'm thinking of... 

00:33:15
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN ...in particular, and they really don't identif-, they identify as Americans. 

00:33:20
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN You know? So they're pushing away. I've just observe, obviously, you have an accent, and... 

00:33:30
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN ...you observe the difference. 

00:33:30
DR. ARPANA INMAN Interesting. Right. And, I, I think this is something that you notice in other ethnic communities as well, that there's an evolution and a progress that happens as more people start addressing these issues that people might feel more comfortable talking about it. Thank you. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Um, I've also noti-, uh, we have, um, again, uh, Asian Indians who've immigrated from Giana... 

00:34:00
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN ...so their middle step is, or from Trinidad... 

00:34:05
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN ...so, um, I've some Hindus that have come from Trinidad and it becomes apparent when they talk about going back for a death ceremony kind of thing. Um, does that make a difference to their level of discrimination, if they, sort of view themselves more as Caribbean Americans, or do you think they really don't, they really view themselves as... 

00:34:30
DR. ARPANA INMAN Um, I'm, I'm not sure I can answer that question, because I really haven't, um, had an opportunity to explore that area, but certainly, identification matters. And, how they identify can certainly play out in how they met and deal with those issues. Um, I would assume, also, that there's an influence of the black culture that comes in, and I wonder what that inter-mix, then, would create for the person in terms of identification. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN I would say, none of these, none of my clients, anyway, they never refer to themselves as being black... 

00:35:05
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN ...or refer to themselves as African-Americans, they s-, think of themselves more as Indians. 

00:35:15
DR. ARPANA INMAN Right. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN I was, uh, curious if you could speak to, kind of, well, first, whether the population was all immigrant, or if there was any refugee? Um, thinking of the kind of recent resettlement of Bhutanese Nepali refugee populations and how you think that might play into coping mechanisms, identification, within the American culture? 

00:35:40
DR. ARPANA INMAN Yeah. No-, none of these, uh, participants, if you're looking at the specific research I did, were, uh, refugees, they were all voluntary immigrants. Um, certainly refugees kind of creates a different dilemma in terms of the, the identity and the different cultural spaces they would occupy. Uh, I think certainly language issues might certainly surface a little bit more, employment, um, and, I think they would certainly experience greater discrimination, but part of it is would they have access to the resources that would be needed, um, and would they feel comfortable accessing the resources is something to look at. Um, so, yeah, I think that's a good question, and that's an important area to explore. 

00:36:30
[sil.] 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN I was wondering when you were doing your research if you looked, if you looked at all about where these immigrants were settling, in like, just rural or cities, and if that affected, like, copi-, coping and distancing with identity? 

00:36:45
DR. ARPANA INMAN Um, a lot of them were - at least the population that I interviewed were in urban settings, but, some of them had lived in rural areas or more suburban areas and talked about the fact that when they lived in those areas it was harder for them, um, to be, because the-, there wasn't as much of a South Asian community to connect with, and so, perhaps, there was a greater attempt to assimilate whereas, when there's a larger enclave of an ethnic community there's not as much pressure. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN In regards to, um, South Asian, say, families and parents from the first generation living in urban centers and, um, kind of getting together to preserve their community as a protective factor, but on the flip side, I've seen pockets in different cities. And, what's your view on, do you think that, that separation reinforces the discrimination in a mainstream society? Like, if that makes sense. Like, it's a protective factor but how does it also reinforce that belief for mainstream that this community is somewhat an other, or not necessarily included in society. 

00:38:00
DR. ARPANA INMAN Right. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN If that makes... 

00:38:00
DR. ARPANA INMAN I, I think with the larger number of South Asians in this country, at this time, certainly there's a greater push by first generation parents, uh, to own their identity and even to second generation, actually. A large number of second generation is owning their identity and being very proud and, in fact, that was one of the things they talked about, is that you need to feel proud about your identity. Um, I think this is true of, whether it's a South Asian community, or any other community, that when you are seen as distinct or s-, different, that you are gonna experience some kind of prejudice, perhaps, um, but, if families are able to talk about it at home, I think the socialization that happens at home is really important in terms of developing coping skills. And, um, it was kind of curious when I was doing a focus group with these parents, one of the mothers' young sons walked in, and, uh, she, she turned around to him and said, "Have you ever experienced any discrimination? Have you, has anyone ever called you any names, or bullied you?" And he says, "Yeah. People call me 7-Eleven. Uh, Dunkin Donuts," and he said, "Well," and, and she said, "Well, does that upset you?" and he's like, "well, no, not really. I just kind of, blow it off." Um, but it was curious that the parents hadn't even thought about talking with their children, but after having, uh, met in the focus groups, and having had a chance to talk amongst themselves, they also talked about the fact that they were gonna go back home and talk about these issues at home. So, I think part of it is having a conversation and being aware, I, I think racism happens everywhere, to every community. Part of it is, how can we talk about it within our homes, so that we can start looking at what kind of coping is needed. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Hi. Uh, I got the sense that, um, in your research, there seemed to be this process of, uh, in, uh, Indian, um, trying to figure out where they fit, uh, in the, the racial binary of black or white, and that's part of the racialized identity pe-, uh, they'll experience in the US. Wondered if you could speak more to that? 

00:40:05
DR. ARPANA INMAN Um, certainly skin color is a major issue, and I think it, there's a historical piece that is important to know about South Asians and Asian Indians that there's a lot of discrimination with regard to skin color even back in India, that the darker you are, the less attractive you are. If you look at marriage proposals and other kinds of things that happen online, oftentimes it's said, you know, fair, fair skinned bride, and, there's an assumption, immediately, that just because you're fair skinned, you're pretty or you're better. Um, so I think some of that kind of, uh, prejudice, internalized pre-, uh, dis-, dis-, uh, prejudice, kind of, is brought here, as well, um, and so, when I presented to you some of the history, there was the reticence to even align with the black community, despite the fact that the black community has been fighting, um, for their rights, and a lot of other communities have kind of joined with the black community to do that, but it's kind of interesting that the South Asian community hasn't, though, there's a shift with the second generation. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Hi. Um, you spoke a little bit about the second generation, um, earlier, but I'm curious if you could, uh, speak a little bit more about that? I'm thinking about that, um, that the first generation seems to think the second generation is more capable of dealing with discrimination, but also, it sounds like they, that, that the group that you worked with did not seem to have any conversations about this. And also, you talked about how the first generation often thinks of India as back home, and if there is that lack of identification with America from your parents? Like, how does the second generation identify as Americans or not? Um, I, I'm just curious if you've done or looked into any of that, or...? 

00:41:55
DR. ARPANA INMAN Yeah. Um, identity is very interesting, in terms of how we negotiate identity and certainly the kinds of messages we receive at home, certainly play out. Um, there's some, I, I've done some research on that, um, and certainly, I think with, th-, the, some of the research that I've done, showed that second generation struggled with the compartmentalization - what they had to do, as they were growing up. Uh, but as they've grown older and kind of come into their own, so to speak, they've been able to educate and talk to their parents so, for, at least from the second generation perspective and also from some of these first generation parents, um, that there's a sense that there's something to be learned from the second generation, and that, perhaps, second generation have a better way of handling certain things and, so, there's a lot of this piece of kind of roles have shifted where parents were teaching their children, now the children are teaching the parents how to deal with some of those things. 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN As a second generation Indian in this country - I'm born, raised here - I've, uh, experienced a lot of what you're saying and some of the, uh, I've come to consider over the past several years are the challenges that Indian, parents from Indian faced in raising their children, in a, in a country that they don't even see as their own. It's not just foreign, it's not their own, and the kind of subtle messages that come through, and in, in rearing children here in the US, um, one of the most, uh, the biggest messages for me, was that we're here alone... 

00:43:30
DR. ARPANA INMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN ...you have to make it. Um, but, uh, uh, a thought came to me about how, uh, children fundamentally, uh, born and raised here in the US, go through a very different process than their parents. It's the difference between cultlration, um, from the parents' generation, and then the, uh, ethnic identity formation that their children must go through and these are both parallel processes that sometimes don't always intersect, until... 

00:43:55
DR. ARPANA INMAN Right. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN ...as you said, later in life. 

00:43:55
DR. ARPANA INMAN Yeah. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Um, but through some of my research, I came to understand how some people just don't even have a language, and, and some people either reject that they have been hurt, or that there, there's an enlightenment that happens, that, there is a word for what I have experienced. 

00:44:10
DR. ARPANA INMAN Right. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN ...and this is what it means. I don't know if, if you, you've kind of, um, if you could say something about this particular group that you had, uh, researched, as far as, um, looking at, uh, how different people responded to the language that came up in reference to discrimination? 

00:44:30
DR. ARPANA INMAN I, I think you said it very well, in terms of your own experience. Um, with, with this research and with other research that I've done on South Asians, the parents certainly recognize. They recognize they don't have a language, as you've said, to put to some of these experiences, but they recognize that their children experience challenges, and so it's, it's kind of a dilemma, in terms of how do you deal with this, and I think the parents have struggled a little with the role reversal, as well, because they're supposed to be the ones care, taking care of the children. Um, so, that's kind of a different experience, growing up as parents in this country as well, because they don't have the social structures to support their parenting, and so that have to try and kind of reinvent or re-realize what their parenting looks like in this country as well. Um, so I think it's a growing process for both the children and the parents. Uh, so that's kind of, that was highlighted a little bit in the research and I think more is needed to kind of ex, explore this area. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Um, hello, uh, Indian Americans have been, in spite of all these obstacles and challenges that you've mentioned, have been, uh, in large part, extremely successful here in the United States. I was wondering if you could speak, uh, a little bit about some of the resilience and maybe some of the factors that you feel have kind of helped contribute to that type of success. 

00:46:00
DR. ARPANA INMAN Um, that's a very interesting question, and I'm challenged, in some ways to kind of respond to that. Um, certainly, I think part of it is the, e-, even though there isn't that language, that perhaps is discussed, the fact that there's family support, um, certainly helps. The fact that there's a larger Indian, South Asian community, now, in the United States, certainly helps. Um, the more vocal people are with regard to their experiences certainly helps. The fact that they've been certain, um, Indian professionals, South Asian professionals in the political arena, certainly helps to kind of see that, perhaps they can be a voice for and help with and create some advocacy for the South Asian community. Um, but the reality is that irrespective of what the community sees as trends, given that, uh, whether it's work ethic, whether it's uh, economic, or professional success, racism is, is not gonna go away and, um, I don't know if it's a resiliency is my, as perhaps just not wanting to deal with it, and that's maybe the way some, some south Asians deal with it. They don't, they don't, they distance themselves from the experience and the process, so I don't think that's resiliency or that's a way of coping. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Hi. I just wanted to add the whole, uh, the success of Indians and, um, under the umbrella of the model minority myths, sometimes, and you've written about this, I've read it, uh, sometimes, it can also cause some problems in that it can mask, uh, difficulties that they may be experiencing, including racism, um, uh, the expectations to perhaps major or go into a career that may not be a strength or forte, because the expectations for them. So, uh, as a clinician, I tend to work, I work mostly with college students and young adults. Uh, I tend to work with those that are really struggling because of those expectations, so, there is all this success, um, but we just have to be careful as practitioners, uh, that sometimes, in this community, image, uh, success, uh, being together, being successful is so critical and important, that, uh, that students or individuals may not show the experience of racism and distress or discrimination anxiety, and often, a very strong stigma towards mental illness and mental health, because of that expectation to be successful. 

00:48:50
DR. ARPANA INMAN Thank you. 

00:48:55

00:48:55
DR. ARPANA INMAN You've said it very well.

00:49:10
DR. ARPANA INMAN Thank you. Thank you so much for bringing up the wonderful questions and for giving me some more ideas as to where I should go for my future research, and I hope some of you there will, uh, in the com-, uh, the audience will also engage in some of this research. So thank you.
