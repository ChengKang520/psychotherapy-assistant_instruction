Grief after a suicide A 20-Year Perspective 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN It might be a little more personal too, when you, when you have to go to the door and tell somebody that their husband, father, son, daughter, whatever has died by accident, by suicide or homicide. How do, you know, what have been your responses to bring people to this shocking news. Do they scream? Do they think? Do they, sit down and cry? Do they, go into shock? 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN UNKNOWNAll of the above. 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I, I, I've delivered a lot of those crisis messages just because, you know, I was on shift so I request.

Laura Nokes Lang Mother 

00:00:50
LAURA NOKES LANG A death has occurred and everything is changed by this event. We are painfully aware that life can never be the same again that yesterday is over, that relationships once rich have ended, but there is another way to look upon this trip. If life went on the same without the presence of the one who died, we can only conclude that the life we can remember made no contribution, filled no space, meant nothing. The fact that this person left behind a place that cannot be filled is a high tribute to this individual. Life can be the same after a trinket has been lost, but never the same after the loss of a treasure. Our treasure was my son, Keith Nokes who committed suicide 20 years ago. His death was the most devastating experience I have ever endured. Since his death I have worked hard for the prevention of suicide so that no one else should ever have to go through this. But this presentation is not about Keith or his death or me. It is about the survival of his friends and sister, immediately following the death in the years since then. Some actions may be useful in coping with grief and others may not. Experiencing grief, coming to acceptance of the loss is important. Just as this person was part of your life while he or she was alive, he or she will probably remain a part of your life on some level, not getting stuck at a point along the way to acceptance is important so that life can be good again. All of the interviews you are about to watch are with people who were close friends of my son. They're sharing their personal stories to help you learn from their experience in dealing with this death. One of Keith's friends elected not to be in this program, but he has allowed me to share his statement. "Everyone who is left behind after a suicide is not okay. They are not okay. They will never be the same. Their lives are changed forever, not in a good way. Some of their lives are ruined forever. The only good thing about going through a suicide is that you might gain some insight, some experience, knowledge, whatever about what to look for in the future in case you come across someone that may be considering suicide." This is only one view point of someone who dealt with their grief by isolating himself from other friends of Keith and by not seeking any help but by internalizing his feelings. He's a survivor too. Each one has to find their way. Now, here are several interviews with Keith's friends. We hope you will find all these stories helpful. 

00:03:50
Melanie Nokes Sister 

00:03:50
MELANIE NOKES He was my older brother by three years. When I was 17, when my brother passed away I was a junior in high school. It was school time, it was exams, uh. I was getting ready to be done with the school year. 

00:04:00
Marsha Sanders Interviewer 

00:04:00
MARSHA SANDERS Do you recall your thoughts and feelings when you first learned of Keith's suicide. 

00:04:05
MELANIE NOKES Uh, I think I went into shock, emotional shock after that. I think, I have snippets of memories from around that time but I don't have a decent memory. I think initially because we all grieve differently. I grieve by sleeping. I didn't have the memories of dreams. It was, I think it was kind of my brain's way of cocooning me from my emotions, giving me some time away from them, uh, to allow me to do some healing at the time. When we had the memorial service for him, my mom was planning everything and I specifically requested to do the memorial table. The things that he loved and did, I tried to bring into the table for everybody who knew him. I used the parts that made him who he was and we were having to deal with the grief. We deal with it differently. My mom, she wanted to leave his room exactly as he left it. For me, to move on in my grief I needed to start making it less him. It took time. I would have conversations with my mom and I would say, "I need to do something." And she would say, "I'm not ready for you to do something." My mom finally said, "You can make some changes but only some changes." After I did it, she said, "Oh that wasn't so bad." And it helped me 'cuz I was moving on again, and I think in some ways it helped her because she could start moving on again. 

00:05:40
MARSHA SANDERS Were any of your personal relationships changed immediately because of Keith's death? 

00:05:45
MELANIE NOKES Yeah, because they didn't know what to say. None of us knew what to say. None of us had ever experienced anyone killing themselves. They were scared that they didn't know how to reach out to me and that was one of the hardest things for me, I think. And with my parents, it was immediate change as well because we were all grieving separately, and honestly I have to say probably one of the best things my mom did for me was she recognized how isolated I had become and that she couldn't do anything for me and she actually said, "I need to find somebody for Melanie that she can talk to." So she actually found a therapist for me that I could just talk to. We were all 17. You have a lot of thoughts and understanding and such but that kind of emotion, this extreme emotion, typically at age 17 you have no reference points for them so you would talk to, I talked to my friends and they, they were sad and they were hurt because my brother was gone, but they understood that what I was going through was something they couldn't understand, and so it was, there was this gap. 

00:06:55
MARSHA SANDERS What do you think helped you the most? 

00:07:00
MELANIE NOKES Going back to school was helpful. Um, it was hard initially because I was afraid in some ways to go back because I didn't know how people would react to me and that summer had been very quiet for me. And I kind of got back into living. I think that also helped. 

00:07:20
MARSHA SANDERS In what ways did living through this experience change you? 

00:07:25
MELANIE NOKES The person who I am today is partly due to all of my life experiences and I can't say I would still be the person who I am today and I like who I am, so I don't know if that would necessarily, if, if I changed behaviors, I changed in my relationships but it definitely changed my perspective on things. I don't look at that same having experience as such a significant loss when I was just 17, I, I don't, I'm not as afraid of it. Um, I don't want it, but I'm not afraid of it, uh. I also have a way of candidly talking about death. I went down that dark tunnel and I've come back and I know I can survive that fine and until I think you do that until you have that journey sometimes you don't really understand that. I strike more of a balance between planning for the future and living for today. Well, they say there are different phases of grief and I think that I recently experienced one of them when I got very mad at him. When it was his birthday, this last 40th, if he was still alive, we would've been having a big party for him. 40 is a big year and he denied us that opportunity so I got mad. I recognize that there are no words that can make it better, but just making sure that person knows they're supported. There's nobody who can grieve like you're grieving so you feel completely alone, but knowing you're physically not alone, is really helpful and just making sure to not leave that person because you still care but you don't have to say anything. You don't have to make it better. You don't have to have all the right words. That's probably one of the most significant things I've learned over the years.

Julie Laudel Girlfriend 

00:09:40
JULIE LAUDEL I was 17 at the time, um. I just graduated high school. I was, um, about ready to enjoy my summer. I was Keith's girlfriend at the time. I think we were going out for a couple of years two years. 

00:10:00
Voice of Mary Tuneberg Interviewer 

00:10:00
MARY TUNEBERG What do you recall of your thoughts and feelings? 

00:10:00
JULIE LAUDEL I had to see a, uh, a psychologist right away because I was very distraught. 

00:10:10
From an interview four years after Keith's suicide 

00:10:10
JULIE LAUDEL I was devastated, I mean it was just unimaginable. I couldn't, I just, I couldn't imagine that happening and then. Um, my downfall was pretty hard. Um, you know like, I wouldn't eat for weeks and lost a lot of weight. My thoughts were consumed about it. I felt like I could, I could just see me but not really feel, you know, anything. I was young. I had dreams, you know, that he was, oh, then you wake up and it's like all this weight is just on your chest and it will not leave. That was my only way of really getting things out and it was right after he died I would write as if he were still, you know, around or that, you know, that I could tell him, you know, why did you do this and everything, but when I started college I just, um, found it was, you know, I knew about the subject, I, I was a victim of it and a survivor, and I was able to express, like, I was talking to somebody about it because I, no one really wanted to listen I felt to what I, it's like I wanted to explain it to try to make some sense of it. I immediately placed blame on a, on a lot of people that, that they weren't watching him or that they should've seen something or done something that they didn't. um, I didn't think that they had the right to be the last person to see him, that it should've been me. I have learned that, that was just part of the process, but, um, people go through when, when a death like this occurs, an unexpected death occurs. It took time. I think it changes who you are and, uh, it just being 20 years, it still affects you but you, I, I have a fear in my personal relationships that, that, something will happen to somebody very close to me that I love and it, I believe it causes a lot of anxiety to this day or me. 

00:13:10
MARY TUNEBERG How long do you think you were grieving, heavily or strongly? 

00:13:15
JULIE LAUDEL Heavily two years and, um, and I started to grow. 

00:13:25
MARY TUNEBERG And what helped you grow? 

00:13:25
JULIE LAUDEL Family, um, my belief in God. Just, uh, I came to a realization that, um, no matter how bad I felt or how sad I felt I would rather feel than than be dead and not feel at all so I kind of, um, just took in all of my feelings and, and, and learned to deal with them. No matter how much pain I was in I, I, I was living and I wanted to be alive and, um, that this feeling is, is part of life and that I would, I would get through it, I would. It wouldn't always be this bad. 

00:14:35
MARY TUNEBERG I feel there has been some recovering now. 20 years later. What does that recovery feel like for you? 

00:14:45
JULIE LAUDEL I feel an inner strength, probably that I've, I've never had, and, uh, life, living life. 

00:15:00
MARY TUNEBERG Do you still think of Keith and what happened? 

00:15:05
JULIE LAUDEL I absolutely still think about it. It, it, it, it's sad still. How frequently, I mean, not, not as often as, as say 15 years ago but, um, but I think about it. I have, I have, maybe experiences that will bring me back or dream of it that would remind me of him. 

00:15:40
MARY TUNEBERG What if anything do you think has helped you deal with your grief better? Especially in the period of time immediately following Keith's death. 

00:15:55
JULIE LAUDEL Having other people around me that have gone through the same thing, um to let me know, you know, that what I was going through was very normal and my feelings were very normal. Um, I, I, I, I read books, um, that went through the different stages and I think that that helped. Again that was a bro-, it wasn't somebody being next to me saying, "Yes. What you're feeling is normal." And I've worked through the same thing myself, so, I think having a support system of, of people that have also gone through it would have helped more at the time. Now 20 years later, I understand that, I, had to go through everything that I went through in order to survive and to um, understand that life is worth living and no matter how bad you feel, it's, it's feeling that is living. 

00:17:05
Marsha A. Sanders Interviewer 

00:17:05
MARSHA SANDERS What was your relationship with Keith. 

00:17:15
Steve Baca Friend 

00:17:15
STEVE BACA Um a good friend of Keith. Classmate, we spent a lot of time together, uh, sledding, uh, just being a high school kid. 

00:17:30
MARSHA SANDERS Do you recall your thoughts and feelings? 

00:17:35
STEVE BACA Uh, I felt very empty. You really feel like you're 'gonna be that way the rest of your life. You're 'gonna feel that way every day for the rest of your life. Um, just something you have to, you're thrown into. 

00:17:50
MARSHA SANDERS What actions did you take as the result of your grief? 

00:17:55
STEVE BACA Um, definitely withdrawn for a while, um, I, I guess I just dealt with it in my own way, uh, sarcasm, dry humor, hiding the truth, and I shouldn't have but again it was my way of dealing with it. Um, do what you've got to do to get you through one day at a time. Talk to close friends. 

00:18:25
MARSHA SANDERS Were any of your personal relationships changed? 

00:18:25
STEVE BACA I thought we were pretty tight knit group of friends and it definitely brought us closer together. 

00:18:30
MARSHA SANDERS For how long do you think that you were grieving really strongly? 

00:18:35
STEVE BACA Deep grieving, um, obviously not something you can just come out of, uh, I would say I was numb for a couple weeks and the grieving almost starts for me, anyway it started after that time because it was such a shock. I didn't believe he was gone. I didn't believe it. Very, it's a, it's a tough thing to accept. You know, somebody you practically grew up with is not, not there with you camping, you know, whatever activities, road trips. It's very destructive. Um, again it, it hurts a lot of people and I'd have to say that I think it's very selfish, so that's why I'm angry at him, you know that we're here without him and going through it day after day, the good and the bad. 

00:19:40
MARSHA SANDERS Do you still think about Keith and what happened? 

00:19:40
STEVE BACA I definitely do, many time I hear Death Leopard, um, there are, there are many situations where, where I think of Keith and I think again just, uh, hanging out with anybody within the group, his name comes up or the situation comes up, stories. Um, how often I, I can't specifically say but, um, there are times when it's very often. Two or three times a week there's something that involves him or reunion of course, uh, again camping, something that we're doing that would've normally involved him as well. So, it's there and it's, it's barely consistent, uh, but just at random also I definitely think about, you know, what it would be like if he would be here, all, all the group, all of us, we have families and careers and, and, so, he's, he's not there. he's not a part of that so there's a huge question, you know. What, what would it be like if you were here. What would his family be like? What would he be doing right now? But, um, I don't, I would say it doesn't lessen, I don't think of him less as time goes by, I just, you get into a groove and you accept it and, and, I guess there's always going to be something that reminds you of him, and you learn. You learn to roll with it. 

00:21:30
Jeff David Kernan Friend 

00:21:30
JEFF DAVID KERNAN Um, we were, ah, friends from we went to junior high together. I say I was 19. 

00:21:35
Marsha A. Sanders 

00:21:35
MARSHA SANDERS Do you recall your thoughts and feelings? 

00:21:40
JEFF DAVID KERNAN I heard about I on my horse field(ph) basically, and you know, when he did I was angry for no reason. You know, you, you can't, I don't know, you can't, you can't, rationalize it, you know what I'm saying. It was okay you did that. I was mad at him, like, if he had it to take back I'm sure without question he'd take it back. Now, I was, probably part of that was probably standoffish about it because it did, it did piss me off to a certain point. Obviously it upset me, I mean because, as we always said, we had plans, you know, to do things, trips, and, uh, he wasn't there for any of those, you know, so, he wasn't there for the reunions. He's messed up the reunions. Every time we have get together or our 10 or 20 year reunion he's definitely a subject, you know, and I'm sure he's done it too. 

00:22:35
MARSHA SANDERS What actions did you take as a result of your grief. 

00:22:40
JEFF DAVID KERNAN I think we, you know, some of us got together and, uh, you know just try to, I don't know, take it all in, you know. I know there was a period of time that they had adopted something back here for cleaning. We were getting together to do that. I think it was, I don't know if it was weeks, days, or months. Most of us stayed together, you know, for years after that, but I think there's a certain part of that whole set of people that isn't the same. You know, I think things changed. I mean life changes anyway after you get out of high school. Everybody moves on but I think something changed for everybody. I have a better appreciation for life because of it, you know, I've been with my, with my spells for 16 years and we have two children, you know. When I think of him I think of appreciating life, you know. I also think about the difficulty that, you know, that it would be as a parent, to have children. I think I project that on my own son. I have a daughter, you know, I wouldn't want my son to do that. I would comprehend that It'd be the way it would, you know, looking at for the future. It's I don't know why I think about things like that but I do. I definitely, it definitely plays a part in my life. 

00:24:00
Jodie Mooney Friend 

00:24:00
JODIE MOONEY I was friends with him in high school and a group of friends, we all hung out all the tie. We were we were pretty good friends. We, uh, he was best friends with Paul, who was my boyfriend at that time. 

00:24:15
Voice of Mary Tuneberg Interviewer 

00:24:15
MARY TUNEBERG Do you still think of Keith and what happened? How frequently and what are your thoughts when you do? 

00:24:20
JODIE MOONEY Um, it seems like I've always had it in the back of my mind and, my thoughts are of course of why and what can be, look at what everybody has now. What would he have? Would he have kids? Would he? Where would he, where would he be? It definitely changed me, um, because at the time, like, right after it had happened I think I actually attempted suicide and and, I didn't even understand why. I knew I was going through a lot then. You know what, tell you the truth we were drinking that night and I found out later that you when a suicide happens, it spreads and you constantly think about it. Um, you constantly think, you know, even though I was angry, and I was upset that he had done it but also at that time we were young, you don't see the future. You see what, what's happening right then and you know, people say that, oh, life gets harder now, or life gets harder later. You have it easy now, but it's pretty hard when you're in school and just getting out of school and getting life started. There's a lot of things to think about and, so, um, but it was afterwards when I found out that, how it does affect friends, suicide and how it, when one does it when you're close to them, it can, it just opens that door and you start thinking about it, and, you know, maybe this was right, and you know, maybe there was a reason, I don't know. You're old problems just start coming up and you just always think about it at the time and I think that's why afterwards I kind of put a block up then just went on with my life, and, so. 

00:26:40
MARY TUNEBERG How did you learn that, that that, that it can spread? 

00:26:45
JODIE MOONEY Um, it was actually by a doctor, they put a 72 hold on me so I went through counseling and I found out a lot of things so, you know, he may be saved my life. 

00:27:00
MARY TUNEBERG What if anything do you think would've helped you deal with your grief better? 

00:27:05
JODIE MOONEY I think if I would've asked more questions, if I would've, opened up more and not put that wall up and actually found out everything that happened and all the details and really cried on someone's shoulder but I held it all in. 

00:27:35
Ben Wright Friend 

00:27:35
MARSHA SANDERS How old were you and what were you doing at the time of Keith's death? 

00:27:35
BEN WRIGHT Uh, about 17 and a half and doing auto mechanics. 

00:27:40
Marsha A. Sanders Interviewer 

00:27:40
MARSHA SANDERS What was your relationship to Keith? 

00:27:40
BEN WRIGHT Uh, childhood friend, lived across the street, um, as my neighbor. 

00:27:45
MARSHA SANDERS DO you recall your thoughts and feelings? 

00:27:50
BEN WRIGHT Um, angry, um, upset, um, kind of at the time wished that we would've hung out more, uh, and I would've seen him before this all had taken place. 

00:28:05
MARSHA SANDERS What actions did you take as a result of your grief? 

00:28:10
BEN WRIGHT Drinking more and, uh, getting in trouble. 

00:28:15
MARSHA SANDERS For how long do you think that you were grieving really strongly? 

00:28:20
BEN WRIGHT Uh, right after it happened probably maybe, uh, a week or so, um. Towards the end maybe me and Keith weren't hanging out as much as we were when we were littler, when we were younger kids. U, he kind of moved on hanging out with some of the, the older kids in the neighborhood, more his age, and, uh, so the last probably couple of years, ah, we, uh, we really didn't hang out so I guess maybe it didn't affect me as much as some of the older kids at the time he was hanging out with. I had to block it out. Honestly I, I don't think you ever recover. I don't think about it as much. I don't dwell on it now. Maybe, like, when it first happened. 

00:29:05
MARSHA SANDERS In what ways did living through this experience change you? 

00:29:10
BEN WRIGHT Definitely for better. Um, like I said I can look back and think, you know maybe, maybe you know, uh, I'm at the bar or something hanging out with some friends, you know, that, uh, are maybe thinking about doing this that you know, maybe I could, maybe I could help them. Maybe I could be the one guy there, you know maybe, uh, maybe it isn't worth it you know. Try something else. Hang out and talk to people more. 

00:29:40
Rebecca Waters Friend 

00:29:40
REBECCA WATERS When Keith died I was in high school. I was 15 years old and the relationship that I had with Keith was removed to this area when I was five and so, me and my brother and Melanie and Keith were all neighborhood friends and grew up together. 

00:30:00
Voice of Mary Tuneberg Interviewer 

00:30:00
MARY TUNEBERG What do you recall of your thoughts and feelings when you first learned of Keith's suicide? 

00:30:05
REBECCA WATERS It was just, um, devastating. You never think that anything like that would happen to a friend or a family, someone you know. It was, uh, brought how people are so closely connected to you and how you can apprehend one of us. 

00:30:30
MARY TUNEBERG In what way did this experience change you? 

00:30:30
REBECCA WATERS It's made me very aware of the fact that this can happen to any family and any person. Um, but suicide is very real, and, being in going into a profession where you have people who are in life crisis's and talk about suicide, um, absolutely. It makes me have an extreme profound, um, sense of not necessarily understanding the experience they're feeling but that compassion and that empathy and realizing that it's very real and that you need to step in and intervene early. You need to get them help. You can't leave them. For me I think that this experience and some other things in my own life has pushed me to want to be in the psychiatric profession and realizing that we all have life traumas and life events and things that happen and help people to understand because what you do in an instant changes, changes life forever, so yeah. Absolutely, It's changed where I am and I think it's made me be in a place that's good because I want to help people. I've taken these experiences to help instead of, you know. I think you can do things where you make the situation bad fir your own life and I think that in a sense, it's I don't know the word to use, almost a disgrace because, um, you've got to learn something from this and use it for better so that his life wasn't in vein and that his life is remembered and that his life meant something. 

00:32:35
Paul Martinez Friend 

00:32:35
PAUL MARTINEZ I was 20 years old and I was just homes from leave from the Marine Corps. I had been in Saudi Arabia from the Persian Gulf War. I was home visiting friends and family. 

00:32:50
Marsha A. Sanders Interviewer 

00:32:50
MARSHA SANDERS What was your relationship with Keith? 

00:32:50
PAUL MARTINEZ My relationship to Keith was, um, he was my best friend. I've known him since I was, like, five years old, considered him a brother and family more than just a friend. Um, for me I kind of closed down for a little bit and, uh, was trying to help friends and family of Keith and to try and be strong for them and it wasn't tile I got back to North Carolina with my unit that I kind of got to deal with myself and help myself and get myself better. I think finally I just, I went back and talked to a counselor on base, um. I think even for me the counselor didn't help. It kind of felt like I was just talking to someone I didn't connect with. Um, I met someone while I was out there and started talking to her about Keith. I had only known her about probably about a couple of hours and then I started talking about Keith and I let it all out and, um, she listened really well and was kind of there for me and kind of helped start the process for me. 

00:33:45
MARSHA SANDERS Were any of your personal relationships changed immediately because of Keith's death? 

00:34:00
PAUL MARTINEZ I blamed myself and I did blame a couple other people, um, that m maybe we had something to do with it. I blamed his, uh, his girlfriend for a little bit. I blame d me for not handling going and checking on him or calling him and some things but ultimately I kind of realized it wasn't her fault. It wasn't my fault. Once I was able to kind of forgive myself and I forgave other people and went and contacted them and let them know that, you know, they shouldn't blame themselves if they were as well, so, I think they were negative and it turned into a positive with some people, but I've learned to, um, kind of when people I know that are going through something, I'm able to relate to them or talk to them and tell them, um, you know, some of the feelings that they're having I understand but, you know, things get better. They're not, they're not always at their worst. Life has got its ups and downs. 

00:34:50
MARSHA SANDERS For how long do out think that you were grieving really strongly? 

00:34:55
PAUL MARTINEZ Still am. Um, still got pictures of Keith in my room and, um, I have an eagle. Some nights I pass it and I'm okay and some nights I pass it and I miss him. 

00:35:10
MARSHA SANDERS What do you think helped you the most to move away from that really strong grief and into recovery? 

00:35:15
PAUL MARTINEZ Time, you know. I think for me I was surrounded by the friends and family and I really felt this urge to help Julie and help family and kind of look out for myself initially, you know . I felt like I had to be the strong one but after time I kind of removed myself from the situation, I was able to deal with it the way I needed to. I think everybody is 'gonna have different ways of dealing with a loos so just finding the tie to deal with mine would help.

MARSHA SANDERS In what ways did living through this experience change you? 

00:35:55
PAUL MARTINEZ Um, it changed me to have a better understanding of, of people, especially I was in law enforcement for a while so I was used to dealing with people going through hard times or struggling so, um, it, it changed me to be able to communicate with them and hopefully help them with some tough times and people that go through the experience of losing someone, I can just tell you that it is time to get better. It takes time to heal and, you know, you have other people around you and other friends that can support you and be there for you. Sometimes friends are the people that you feel comfortable with. I my case at the time was a complete stranger that I met at the beach but he was there for me and so, you just got to be able to talk and show that but time will eventually heal things.
