00:00:50
HENYA KAGAN Let's take a moment to review the parts of the IPR model you have been exposed to thus far. 

00:00:55
Viewed and discussed • Theory – the basis for the IPR model • Elements of facilitative communication • Exercises – how to deal with people • Seen the recall process in action • Observed the power of this unique method 

00:00:55
NARRATOR You have viewed and discussed the theory that is the basis for the IPR model. You have studied and practiced basic elements of facilitative communication. You have gone through exercises to make it easier for you to deal with the types people and issues that could have gotten in the way of your being effective. And you have seen the recall process in action, and observed the power and potential of this unique method to deepen our interpersonal awareness and effectiveness. 

00:01:20
The key element in the IPR model: • The inquirer role 

00:01:25
NARRATOR Now, it is time to introduce the key element in the IPR model, the inquirer role. 

00:01:30
HENYA KAGAN In order for you to learn and practice the inquirer role, we must first record an interaction between you and another individual. We recommend that you divide into groups of four if possible. We further recommend that you team up with people you do not know well for this first session. If your class has an odd number of people or cannot be divided into four, then create one or more groups of no more than five people in each group. See the instructor's manual for additional suggestions about grouping. Stop the tape now and divide into groups assigning a number to each group. Group number one, number two, number three, etcetera. 

00:02:20
[sil.] 

00:02:25
HENYA KAGAN Now, decide who will be the counselors that is the interviewers or helpers and who will be the person's presenting their concern, the clients or the person seeking help. 

00:02:35
Adopt a letter to identify your role Counselor or Client (sharing a concern) Example - group #1 = A1, B1, C1, & D1 -group #2 = A2, B2, C2, D2 (E2) Please do not switch roles 

00:02:40
NARRATOR Each person in the group will adopt a letter to identify your role, either the counselor or client. For example, in group number one, you will have A one, B one, C one and D one. In group number two, you will have A two, B two, etcetera. In this first round of taping, if you serve as the counselor, you will be either A or B. And if you're sharing a concern as client, then assign yourself the designation C or D. If you must have five people in your group, then it will be necessary for three people to be willing to serve as clients. The third person will be E and one of the counselors will simply have two sessions rather than one but please do not switch roles. That is for now, you will be either a counselor or a client. 

00:03:35
HENYA KAGAN For those of you who are presenting a concern, please keep the following in mind. Please do not role play. You may decide not to present the most upsetting issue in your life with this session because you'll only have a brief time to present the concern. However, we do want you to choose an issue that is a genuine concern. Also, it is important that as a group there is agreement that anything discussed in this and other IPR sessions will be treated in confidence. Nonetheless, if you are the person presenting a concern, you may decide not to discuss something that could seriously damage you if confidence were violated. Well then, what might you decide to share? 

00:04:20
What to share? • Something that has genuinely been on your mind lately • The kinds of people who are most difficult for you to deal with • Concerns about the way you’re raising your children • Concerns about your career choices • Concerns about talking about your concerns 

00:04:25
NARRATOR Certainly, the most obvious choice is to talk about something that had genuinely been on your mind lately. However, another might be the kinds of clients or colleagues who are most difficult for you to deal with or your concerns about the ways you're raising your children compare to the way you were raised or anything related to your concerns about your current or about future career choices. And, of course, you could always talk about your concerns about talking about your concerns. 

00:04:55
HENYA KAGAN Although the tape session will not be played back to the entire class, we will mix groups for the recall session so that the member of the class who was not in your recording group could participate in the tape review or recall session. We will tell you more about that later. The important thing to remember for now is that a member of the large group could be asked to serve as inquirer for you during the recall session at which time they would hear your tape. For the person in the counselor or helper role, please keep the following in mind. 

00:05:30
Counselor/ Helper • Use any skills you’ve learned • Don’t limit yourself • Be as helpful as possible • Use all skills, knowledge and compassion 

00:05:35
NARRATOR If you can use any of the skills you have learned thus far in the IPR course, fine. However, please don't feel you must limit yourself to what you have learned here. Your task is to be as helpful as possible to your colleague by using all the skills, knowledge and compassion at your disposal. 

00:05:55
HENYA KAGAN Okay, stop the tape now and determine who is A, B, C, D, and if necessary E, the fifth person. As a reminder, the person who is the counselor A or B does not present the concern during this session. Similarly, the person who discusses a concern in this session, the client C or D does not assume the counselor role at this time. In later sessions, you will all have an opportunity to assume the other role. As the counselor and client are taping their session, the other members of their group are not to be present in the room so as not to distract them. It is also important that the other group members not develop a sense of the interview prior to the recall sessions. The members who are not recording can take a brief break while keeping an eye on the time. Your instructor will determine how long each recording is to be. Generally, 10 to 15 minutes is long enough for the recall practice sessions. By the way, even if you have video equipment available we recommend that this first inquirer training session be done on audio tape. It's less complicated to use audio the first time and it's good to see that the process can be done using only small inexpensive recorders. However, your instructor will decide what makes the most sense for your particular group. Before leaving the room and letting the next pair record their session, playback the last few seconds of your interview to be certain the tape recorded properly. However, do not review the tape at this time. If another pair of participants tape after you do on the same recorder, keep an eye on the time and let them know when it's time to stop recording and return to class. If you are in a group of five, remember that you will have to keep close watch on the time because your group will have three interviewers. You may need to limit your sessions to 10 minutes each. Now go ahead, make your tapes and then return. 

00:08:20
[sil.] 

00:08:25
HENYA KAGAN Okay, you have made the tape. But before you begin to review your tape, let's examine the role and function of the inquirer. 

00:08:30
Two basic reasons for learning and practicing the inquirer role • First, conduct your own IPR sessions • Second, the attitudes/behaviors useful skills in human interaction – These include the ability to facilitate another in their own learning 

00:08:30
NARRATOR There are two basic reasons for learning and then practicing the inquirer role. First, it will enable you to conduct your own IPR learning sessions. Secondly, the attitudes and most of the behaviors required when you are an inquirer using videotape are very useful skills in human interaction even when there is no videotape. These behaviors and attitudes include the ability to facilitate another in their own learning and exploration versus playing the role of the expert. Here then is another approach to add to your existing repertoire of ways of relating to and helping others. 

00:09:15
HENYA KAGAN Most of you have either been through recall sessions with someone serving as inquirer for you or you have seen films of recall sessions. You may not however have a clear understanding of the role or how you yourself would function in the role of inquirer. The purpose of this unit is to help you define the inquirer role and then learn to use it at the appropriate times and in ways that are comfortable for you. One way to begin defining the inquirer role is to contrast it with traditional consultation, supervision or helping. Let's take a few moments to look at supervision as we have all to often seen it. And then, at an IPR inquiry session. In the film we are going to add the internal dialogue with each person may have been thinking. By the way, throughout the film we deliberately exaggerate differences to make our points as clearly as possible. Okay, first let's look at consultation or supervision as it often occurs followed by what an IPR inquiry might look like in the same situation. 

00:10:35
 When my mother died, I think my dad just stop caring about everything. Even us, his own kids. He was lucky he was still alive but not really. 

00:10:45
 You know that happens a lot. We see that often here. It's really quite normal. I mean, it doesn't happen in every case, of course, but often enough. 

00:10:55
 Do you know why I stop the tape here? 

00:10:55
 What does she have on her mind? I guess I might have goof pretty bad. Grief. Well I'm not sure. I'm not doing a very good job at helping them, am I? Oh oh, here it comes. 

00:11:15
 Oh no, you're not doing so bad at all. It's just, did you notice who was doing most of the talking? 

00:11:20
 Me. I thought it was gonna be a lot worse than that. 

00:11:30
 Yes, in general, I think you need to give the patients more of a chance to tell you whatever it is that the patient needed to tell you. Even if you've heard enough to understand, the patient probably would feel better if you had or perhaps reflected some of his concerns. You know, being a good listener at times can really pay off. 

00:11:55
 Yes, I see what you mean. Good listener. Okay, I'll be a good listener. 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
 When my mother died, I think my dad just stop caring about everything. Even us, his own kids. He was lucky he was still alive but not really. 

00:12:20
 You know that happens a lot. We see that often here. It's really quite normal. I mean, it doesn't happen in every case, of course, but often enough. 

00:12:25
 Well yeah, sure I can imagine the happening with lots of people but it was still damn rough on us. 

00:12:35
 You know a cousin of mine was killed in a car accident. 

00:12:40
 I knew he was asking for help and I, I knew I wasn't giving it to him. I just wanted to get the whole thing over as quickly as possible. 

00:12:50
 Do you recall any other feeling? 

00:12:55
 I was tense. I guess I was scared. I was scared that he'd cry. And I guess then he'd be embarrassed. 

00:13:10
 Where there any risks for you? 

00:13:15
 Well, yeah, as I say he'll be embarrassed. Well, yeah if he cried then I might, if he cried then I might cry and I'd-- my first thought is that, that wouldn't be very professional. My God, in the situation he's in, it wouldn't have done any harm if that did actually happened. I mean, so what? Even if my eye did water, so what? 

00:13:50
HENYA KAGAN Some kinds of learning are well suited to the first approach. But the second approach seems to me to make much more sense when you are trying to help a person become better able to help themselves. What we mean is this. 

00:14:05
Foster a sense of personal responsibility The motivation to change is intrinsic 

00:14:05
NARRATOR In the second approach, a sense of personal responsibility is foster. This should help the student nurse assume ownership of her own behavior. The motivation to change is then intrinsic in her. The odds are that as a result of the recall session, the student nurse will wonder, ponder, rethink, go over the situation and internally rehearse what she may do next time. 

00:14:35
HENYA KAGAN A basic concept of the philosophy of the inquirer role is to encourage change out of her sense of personal responsibility for one's own behavior and out of a feeling that is capable of determining one's own directions for change. In addition to this philosophy of personal attribution and responsibility, there are other considerations. Remember in the introductory tape when Doctor Kagan said that IPR was a research tool as well as a training model and a theory, we haven't said much about IPR as a research tool. Watch this next illustration which is a reenactment of an actual recall session and see if you notice the possible research implications. 

00:15:20
HENYA KAGAN What's going on here? What do you suppose the woman is feeling and thinking? What do you suppose she wants of him or perceives that he wants of her. Are there any risk that she's experiencing? You may have some hunches but only she was there. The videotape playback is more than a visual image to her. It reminds her of many thoughts and feeling we may have hunches about but that we could not know for certain. Can we think of each IPR session as a research process in which all participants learn what was previously unknown? Let's listen to the woman's own recall. 

00:16:05
NORM Connie, let me explain a little bit about how we used the videotape playback. We know that the mind works a lot faster than the voice and so during the session you just had with Frank there couldn't have been time to say all the things that were going through your head. Uhm, but there may have also been some things that occurred to you that you decided not to say and, and tell Frank. Ah, there may have been some vague feelings that you were having that you couldn't find the words for them, they were impressions you were having of him and impressions you thought he was having of you. Perhaps impressions that you, ah, wanted him to have of you and impressions you didn't wanted him to have of you. Uhm, if ask you now to remember some of those, you probably could remember a few. Uhm, when you see the videotape, I think you'll find that it's a very effective stimulant for remembering, ah, and you'll find that you'll able to remember images, risks that, that you were becoming aware of, how your body felt, all of those kinds of things. Uhm, I would like you to stop the videotape playback whenever you remember any of those kinds of things relevant or irrelevant. Stop it just as often as you can. And Connie, you stop and start the playback just by turning that lever from stop to forward and then when you wanna stop it back, you stop again. 

00:17:25
CONNIE Okay. 

00:17:25
NORM All yours. 

00:17:30
FRANK Well, as you know Jane and I really getting quite serious lately - 

00:17:30
NORM Uh-hmm. 

00:17:35
FRANK - and she know me pretty well. Not as well as you do. And, ah, I'm not sure that I would want her to know me as well as you do either. 

00:17:40
CONNIE I hope you don't blame me. 

00:17:45
CONNIE Oh, I was really very conscious of the environment. I was trying to forget about the cameras. I really wanted to get with Frank. I really wanted to be able to help him, to understand him and I was really having a hard time. 

00:18:00
NORM Hmm. Do you think you knew that that's you were at, having a hard time? 

00:18:05
CONNIE Oh yes. I sense that. I mean I sense he was trying to help me by talking out a lot. 

00:18:10
NORM Hmm, what did that do to you? 

00:18:10
CONNIE Well, I guess it made me feel both good and bad. Good because he liked me and was trying to help me. I mean, it was like, like a gift and that was nice. But bad too and I think the bad was stronger because I'm suppose to be helping him. I'm the helper and here he was helping me out. 

00:18:30
NORM Was there anything that you would consider doing? 

00:18:35
CONNIE Yes, I really wanted to talk with him about that. I wanted to talk about the difficulty we were having talking or the difficulty I was having talking and how I sense he was trying to help me out. I really wanted to talk with him about that. I don't know why I didn't say something. 

00:18:55
NORM Do you remember anything else at that point, Connie? 

00:18:55
CONNIE No. 

00:19:00
NORM Uh-hmm, okay. Shall we go back to the playback? 

00:19:00
CONNIE Okay. 

00:19:05
FRANK Well, I thought about taking Jane have to visit my folks but I chickened out the last minute. And now I think I've hurt her feelings a lot and I don't know. 

00:19:20
CONNIE I was feeling very stiff there. I remember, uhm, thinking I, I wasn't gonna be able to get comfortable. I was very aware of being recorded. 

00:19:30
NORM Hmm. Do you recall what you wanted the, the cameras to see or not see? 

00:19:35
CONNIE I wanted to look like a really good counselor. I wanted you or whoever was looking at the film to see how good I am or how good I am sometimes and I think there's something else. I, I guess I don't think I'm very attractive from here to here. I mean, I, I'd never thought I had much of a chin sort of-- and the people focus on that, I look down to them like a Neanderthal or something. So I guess I tried to cover it up like this. That's really wild. I mean, I knew I, I had a vague feeling. I didn't think much of my chin but I didn't realize until now how much I really think about it. 

00:20:30
HENYA KAGAN Now, do you think it is likely that we could have known all that material just from watching the tape? Perhaps we could have sensed some concern on her part. But we weren't there. We didn't experience what she did. 

00:20:45
What's available to us • Is very limited • We could guess – It is unlikely that we will understand completely 

00:20:50
NARRATOR What's available to us as we observe or listen to an account of another person's behavior is very limited, a bit like the tip on an iceberg. We could guess about the shape and quality of the rest but it is unlikely that we will understand everything or understand everything completely. 

00:21:10
With audio or videotape it's possible to: • Speak about what was actually happening • Learn from their new awareness 

00:21:10
NARRATOR With the audio or videotape playback available, it's possible with a little help from us as inquirers for a person to speak about what was actually happening to them and to learn from their new awareness. 

00:21:25
HENYA KAGAN So the inquirer role might be thought of as highly exploratory rather than a role in which we interpret the behaviors of others. If an audio or videotape playback is available to the person, your observations, your interpretations and labels are not only unnecessary but would probably get in the way. In other units, we encourage you to be able to take the risk of labeling what you perceive happening between you and another person. However, in this unit, we would like you to become equally skilled at helping others come to this awareness themselves. There's another basic attitude required of the inquirer. Again, let's look at a brief episode in which we have taken the liberty of supplying the internal dialog to make our point clear. In the first scene, the man with the beard is taking the role of a self-appointed supervisor. In the second scene, we have him assume a different attitude that of the inquirer. You will see what we mean. 

00:22:40
 Right here, I was really quiet because I was concentrating on what Julie was saying. But I notice I have my arms folded across my chest. 

00:22:50
 Arms folded. Possibly protecting himself. You make it sounds like you might have been feeling defensive. Uptight? 

00:23:05
 Defensive. Well yeah, I guess that's it, all right, yeah. Wow! He sees right through you. I wonder if I'll ever be that good. 

00:23:15
 Well I guess I hit that right on your head. Very well done. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:30
 Right here, I was, I was really quiet because I was concentrating on what Julie was saying. Uhm, but I notice I have my arms folded across my chest. 

00:23:40
 Oh, something's happening. I wonder what could help him think it through. What did Julie's communication mean to you? 

00:23:50
 Well, I guess I was feeling really close to Julie and feeling-- I guess like I wanted to hug her. But there was also this vague feeling of what that might lead to. I guess I was feeling pretty defensive. I think maybe I'm a little more afraid of affection than I thought I was. I wonder what I'm really afraid of. 

00:24:15
 He seems to be really struggling with this and his learning a lot. Great. 

00:24:25
HENYA KAGAN How would you conceptualize the differences between those scenes. Typically, we admire our own teaching but the goal in recall is to support the other person's learning. Our source of satisfaction must become the other person's discoveries. If we have done our job well as inquirers and facilitators, we share with the other and the joy and satisfaction of that person's self-exploration. In summary then, as inquirers we must... 

00:24:55
As inquirer we • Learn to enjoy new sources of personal satisfaction • Learn to enjoy the other person’s learning 

00:24:55
NARRATOR Learn to enjoy new sources of personal satisfaction and reward. We must learn to enjoy the other person's learning rather than our teaching. 

00:25:05
The inquirer assumes • There is value in helping a person – Make important discoveries – Develop a sense of self-direction • That self-discovery is a process • That the individual knows better than anyone else • That asking exploratory questions helps put the story into words 

00:25:05
NARRATOR The inquirer assumes that there is value in helping a person make important discoveries. Own these discoveries and develop as sense of self-direction rather than feeling that someone else controls him or her. That self-discovery is a process, not a skill that can be easily learned from a lecture. That the individual knows better than anyone else the meaning of what they experienced. That asking exploratory questions without implying interpretation is the most effective way to help the person doing recall to put the underlying story into words. 

00:25:40
In doing so they gain a deeper understanding of how their own thoughts and feelings relate to, and influence their interpretation of the story 

00:25:45
NARRATOR In doing so, the individual gains a deeper understanding of how their own thoughts and feelings relate to and influence their interpretation of the story. 

00:25:55
HENYA KAGAN There are other concepts involved in the inquirer role. Here is a discussion from an early inquirer training workshop. 

00:26:05
NORM Ah, I didn't tell in, in the film that I should have is the notion of accepting what the person tells you rather than challenging it, challenging their story. You know, the, the accepting what, what people give you. I think that's important. 

00:26:15
 You mean as inquirers then we really have to be willing to accept whatever their able to give us at that point? 

00:26:20
NORM Exactly. Okay. 

00:26:25
BLENDA But Norm(ph), why does it work? Why would somebody be more willing to tell about their underlying story during recall? 

00:26:30
NORM Well, there would probably several reasons. Ah, any ideas? 

00:26:35
 Well, one that comes to mind is safety. You have a reenactment on the videotape and it seems just a little distant. 

00:26:45
JOE It's also safe because with the videotape you already know what happened. Ah, what I mean is like face-to-face, you don't know what's gonna happen next but with the videotape, that fear is gone. I already know what happened. 

00:27:00
 Maybe we're all underestimating the roll of the inquirer though. The inquirer is person who ask good exploratory questions, he's really interested in how you feel, how you're reacting, doesn't judge. I think that would help me self-explore videotape or no videotape. 

00:27:25
BLENDA That's funny, I find myself using leads after an interaction to debrief myself. Like, how did I think my brother was feeling about me then. I have a question though, why would somebody improve or change to this? 

00:27:45
NORM All right. Let me wrestle with that one a little. As a person verbalizes in the presence of the inquirer, the person is finding words to describe feelings and thoughts. Finding words, finding labels for feelings and thoughts is an important way of, of knowing yourself, uhm, of having better control of yourself, knowing thoughts and feelings by the way, problem solving as well as affective states. Uhm, but also as you find words for what had been vague, fleeting, often frightening feelings and saying these words to another person makes what had been a frightening feeling less frightening. I think there's another important reason. Uhm, saying to another person, the inquirer, what you would tempted to say, what you had thought of saying the inquiry, what, what he had thought of saying, what he'd, what he'd wanted to happen and hearing the sound of those statements is actually trying out new behaviors. You see what I mean? Saying what I wanted to say, ah, but didn't, gives one a chance to share the-- perhaps not unpleasant sound of the statement and is a kind of rehearsal, a try out for future action. These are the reasons why I, I, I think people, people learn and change from this, huh. Does that make sense? 

00:29:30
BLENDA Yeah. 

00:29:35
 Something that I've noticed in recall is that it gives a person enough time to try to find the words to describe exactly what that person was experiencing. And to reflect about the kinds of things that he or she wanted to happen and why in fact those weren't happening. 

00:29:50
NORM Well, in mutual recall now, you actually have the two people telling each other with the help of the videotape and the inquirer, uhm, what it is they wanted of each other, what it is they were trying to tell each other, uhm, and when that happens, you have two people actually experiencing a new way of relating a, a, a much more honest, much more direct way of relating, ah, than they had on their recorded session. 

00:30:15
BLENDA When you demonstrated the recall for us, I noticed that you took lots of time to explain exactly what was going to be happening during the recall session. I'm wondering if that's-- if it's necessary to take that much time. 

00:30:30
NORM Oh, I, I think so. Definitely. I want the person to understand that I'm not accusing him or her of lying. And so I say, we know that the mind works faster than the voice and there couldn't possibly have been time to say, ah, the things that were going through your mind during the recording session. Uhm, but I also want them to understand something about the nature of the task. I told them this is not to be an exercise in self criticism. Now, some self-criticism is gonna go on and some self-confrontation is going on and, and I'm not going to fight it, I think it's important. But the main focus, our main emphasis is on recall on remembering. I want the person to know that. So I say, uhm, during the session, ah, there may have been lots of things that went through your mind and you decided not to say. Ah, there were lots of feelings that you were having. You were actually having bodily reactions. Uhm, ah, there were impressions you were having of the other person. There were impressions you wanted the other person to have of you. And they were impressions perhaps that you did not want the other person to have of you. Ah, at times there may have been risks that you perceived. Uhm, and sometimes you even, you may have some, some vague picture of what the consequences of taking those risks would be. Uhm, all of these kinds of things occur when, when two people talk to each other. Now, if I asked you what some of those were I, I go on to say, you probably could remember a few. But when you see the videotape, you'll find it's an excellent stimulant for remembering thoughts, feelings, images, how you body felt, all of those things. Now, I also don't want the person I'm doing recall with to, to feel that they, they must only stop the tape when something important happen. I want them to stop it frequently. Nothing is relevant or irrelevant, so I say to them, please feel free to stop the tape frequently as often as you can. Whenever you remember anything relevant or irrelevant, okay. Well that's what I say but please you find your own words to get those ideas across. Don't, don't use my words, find your own. 

00:32:50
HENYA KAGAN Now it may sound from the description we have given that the inquirer role is a passive one. You mustn't tell the other person what you have seen on the videotape, you mustn't interpret, you mustn't counsel, you mustn't advise and yet you have to facilitate the other person's self understanding. How can you do this? Actually there are may questions and many ways of asking them. Let's develop a preliminary list together by watching some very brief examples. 

00:33:30
 I guess I felt confused by the questions she was asking me. 

00:33:35
 Do you remember what you were thinking? 

00:33:40
Thinking? 

00:33:45
 God, I sound really dumb. I knew nothing I was saying made any sense. 

00:33:55
 What were you feeling? I mean, do you recall how your body felt? 

00:34:00
Feeling? 

00:34:05
 I don't know. It seemed like through this whole tape I wanted to say something. But I didn't say what I wanted to say. 

00:34:15
 What were some of the things that you wanted to say? 

00:34:20
Want to say? 

00:34:25
 I have the feeling that the things he was telling me was really upsetting him. But I guess I didn't say anything. 

00:34:35
 Were there any risks involve for you or for him? 

00:34:40
Risks involved? 

00:34:45
 I was telling him all those things in my life and I really felt helpless. Like somehow, I wasn't doing it right. 

00:34:55
 How did you want him to see you and how do you think he was actually seeing you? 

00:35:05
How did you want the other to see you? 

00:35:15
 What he was saying about his mother reminded me of my mother and I started thinking about her. I know exactly what he was talking about. 

00:35:25
 At that point, what did you want to happen next? 

00:35:25
Hoped would happen? 

00:35:30
HENYA KAGAN Our goal is to learn non-interpretive questions related to a probable content area. As do people talk, they are bound to have thoughts, feelings, expectations, concerns, etcetera. Asking these kinds of questions encourages the person to think about the situation in greater depth. By the way, note this that non-interpretive questions asked what not why. Well, what else could you ask? 

00:36:00
• Were any images or fantasies going through your head? • What did you think the other was feeling? • What effect did the other’s physical appearance have on you? • Did you think the other knew how you felt or what you thought? • Were you ever tempted to say anything which you then decided not to say? • What kept you from saying it? • What images had you hoped to communicate? • What had you hoped you could bring yourself to do or be? 

00:36:00
NARRATOR You could ask were any images or fantasies going through you head? What did you think the other was feeling? What effect did the other’s physical appearance have on you? Did you think the other knew how you felt or what you thought? Were you ever tempted to say anything which you then decided not to say? What kept you from saying it? What images had you hoped to communicate that is? What had you hoped you could bring yourself to do or be? 

00:36:30
HENYA KAGAN Incidentally, once something has been described, it can be refer to by the inquirer. For instance, the inquirer might say, "The nervousness that you mentioned earlier, is that still with you at this point on the tape?" Let's take a look at some fairly typical recall situations. In the following scenes, we will not present the content of the videotape session. See if you can come up with an inquirer's response. What might you say if you were the inquirer? First, in the video recall was a physician. Imagine that she has recorded the session with the patient and has never before had an IPR session. Her first comment is going to require that you explain to her what this process is all about. Try telling the person sitting next to you how you would explain the recall process to the physician. Now, watch this mini ad. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:45
 Before we start the videotape, what is it you want me to do? Do you want me to sort of critique myself or what? 

00:37:55
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:38:00
 At that moment, I remember thinking he looked angry but on some level, I think I also sensed a lot of fear. 

00:38:15
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:38:25
 When he said, I don't think I really wanna to talk about that, I was a bit shook up and I didn't really know what to say next. What would you have said? 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:45
 I notice I move my hands a lot. Probably shouldn't do that, huh? What did I feel? Well I felt he had other problems and that if I could formulate the right question, he'd tell me. But, of course, he eventually did. 

00:39:00
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:39:05
HENYA KAGAN It is possible at this point simply to offer a brief inquiry lead such as what were you actually tempted to say? But one might also choose to explain to the physician why he would rather not get involve in the discussion of what you might have done. In this case, the following statements might be offered. 

00:39:25
"I can tell you what I would like to believe I would have said if I had been there, but that would be a very highly speculative game on my part because I really don't know how I would have behaved, - - do you recall anything that you had considered saying"? ...or... "I really think the benefit of the recall process lies in our focusing not on what advice I could give you or in what I might have done. The real power of this method lies in our concentrating on what was going on with you." ...or... As inquirer to the physician you might also say: • Do you remember how you felt at that moment? • Do you think he knew you were shook up? • Did you have any feel for what he may have wanted from you? • Did you want him to know you were shook up? • How do you think he felt about you at that moment? 

00:39:30
NARRATOR I could tell you what I would like to believe I would have said if I had been there, but that would be a very highly speculative game on my part because I really don't know how I would have behaved, do you recall anything that you had considered saying? Or, I really think the benefit of the recall process lies in our focusing not on what advice I could give you or in what I might have done. The real power of this method lies in our concentrating on what was going on with you. Or, as an inquirer to the physician you might also say, do you remember how you felt at that moment? Do you think he knew you were shook up? Did you have any feel for what he may have wanted from you? Did you want him to know you were shook up? How do you think he felt about you at that moment? 

00:40:25
HENYA KAGAN Watch the next mini ad and try to imagine what you might say if you were the inquirer. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
 This is the third time I've seen him, I really like him. I think he's terrific. But TV really shook me up. I guess having that camera staring at me really got to me. 

00:40:55
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:41:00
 What I was feeling here was just plain old anxiety. 

00:41:05
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:41:10
 At that point, I guess I was kind of hinting and hoping he'd pick it up, you know. 

00:41:20
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:41:25
 I just didn't know if I could bring myself to tell him what was really on my mind. I was afraid of what his reactions might be if I really leveled with him. 

00:41:40
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:41:45
 Well, I, I think I was afraid he get mad, reject me. 

00:41:50
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:41:55
 I don't know. I guess I sort of imagined him walking out and leaving me all alone. I'd suddenly feel abandoned. Really awful feeling. 

00:42:10
If you were her inquirer, what would you say? 

00:42:10
NARRATOR If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:42:20
HENYA KAGAN Now, we would like you to practice the inquirer role. In this first practice session, you will be doing recall with the counselor or interviewer only. Here we are interested in helping the person who was the counselor or helper to put into words their thoughts, feelings, expectations and so on they experienced during the recorded session. If the group has four or five members, there will be only two interviewers. It is important that the interviewers be able to speak without feed back, praise, criticism or correction from the person who presented the concern. Thus, we ask that the persons who were clients switch groups so they are not in the same recall group as their counselors or helpers. 

00:43:05
Original Groups Counselors A1, B1 A2, B2 Clients C1, D1, (E1) C2, D2, (E2) 

00:43:10
NARRATOR The easiest way to form recall groups is to reassemble into your original groups. A one, B one, C one, D one and then for the clients, Cs and Ds switch groups. For example, counselors A one and B one are joined by client C two and D two. Counselors A two and B two are joined by clients C one, D one and E one if one had a group of five members. We will now demonstrate the inquirer role. 

00:43:40
The inquirer role B1 will be the inquirer of A1 (Rob) 

00:43:40
NARRATOR Let's have the first counselor A one. We'll refer to a A one as Rob be inquired by the second counselor B one. In other words, B one will be the inquirer for A one. As the inquirer, he would start by explaining the process saying something like this. 

00:44:00
HENYA KAGAN Rob, let me explain how IPR works. We know that the mind works a lot faster than the voice. And so during the session you just have, there couldn't have been time to say all of the things that were going through your head. But there may also been some things that occur to you that you decided not to say. Or maybe some vague feelings that you are having now that you couldn't find the words for them. There may have been impressions you were having of your client and impressions you thought he or she was having of you. Perhaps these were impressions that you wanted him or her to have of you and/or impressions you didn't want the client to have of you. If I ask you now to remember some of them, you could probably recall a few. I think you will find however that listening to the tape is a very affective mental stimulant. It will help you to remember images, risk that you were becoming aware of, bodily sensations and endless other thoughts and feelings. I would like you to stop the videotape playback whenever you remember anything about the session relevant or irrelevant. Stop it as often as you like. Now, let as assume that Rob starts the playback in ways which seems like a long time before he stops the tape. First, let me assure you that 99% of all people will stop the tape and talk about what was happening. If it seems like a long time has passed since they stopped, you can quietly remind them. Stop the tape whenever you remember anything at all. Don't wait for the dramatic moment. Stop it whenever you remember anything. Hooray! Rob finally stopped the tape and says... 

00:46:00
"I was lost - I had no idea what he was trying to tell me, but I tried to look as if I understood." 

00:46:00
ROB I was lost. I had no idea what he was trying to tell me, but I tried to look as if I understood. 

00:46:05
NARRATOR The inquirer takes a moment to look down the list of inquirer leads. It's important at this stage to keep the list in front of you. 

00:46:15
"Was there anything you were tempted to ask?" 

00:46:15
NARRATOR He or she decides to ask Rob something like, "Was there anything you were tempted to ask?" 

00:46:20
"Well I thought of saying 'I'm lost.. I'm just not able to follow you,' but I was afraid to ask that." 

00:46:25
ROB Well I thought of saying I'm lost. I'm just not able to follow you, but I was afraid to ask that. 

00:46:30
"What did you imagine might happen if you said that?" "Anything else? No? OK, then, let's go back to the tape replay." 

00:46:30
NARRATOR The inquirer might then say, "What did you imagine might happen if you said that?" And so on, after few minutes when Rob seems to have said all he can remember about that moment in time, the inquirer might say, "Anything else? No? Ok, then, let's go back to the tape replay." If Rob stops the tape again and says something that leaves the inquirer unsure about how to proceed, the inquirer could then turn to the other group members and ask them to be his consultant. 

00:47:00
"What could I say Rob?" 

00:47:05
NARRATOR What could I say to Rob? When someone makes a suggestion that the inquirer likes, he or she turns to Rob and tries out the inquirer lead suggested by other group members. 

00:47:15
HENYA KAGAN After 10 minutes, the inquirer stops and asks Rob to give him feedback about how he did as his inquirer. Where there questions he should have ask him but didn't? Questions he did ask but should not have? In general, how did he help or hinder the recall. A second person in the group, C two, then takes over the inquirer role and continues the recall process with the same first counselor, A one, or in this case Rob. It is very likely that the first inquirer will not have reviewed the entire tape with the first counselor. Start the tape where the first inquirer left off. 

00:48:00
B1 is first inquired by A1 (Rob) then by D2, E2 etc... 

00:48:00
NARRATOR After 10 minutes of recall in about five minutes of feedback to the inquirer, a playback of the second counselor's B one tape is begun. The second counselor, B one, is inquired of first, by counselor A one, Rob, and then by the fourth and if necessary by the fifth member of our group, D two and E two. When all the members have had a turn at the inquirer role, the group reassembles in the classroom to learn and practice client recall. 

00:48:35
HENYA KAGAN Now, divide into your inquirer practice groups and conduct the recall sessions. Well, what did you learn from interviewer recall? 

00:48:50
Did the counselor pick up subtle cues? • Do you see how we perceive much more than we let on? • Could any of he comments have been said during the interview? 

00:48:50
NARRATOR Did the counselor pick up subtle cues that were not dealt with in the interview? Do you see how we perceive much more than we let on that we have perceived? Could any or even many of the comments made by the counselor during the recall session actually been said during the interview itself? 

00:49:10
HENYA KAGAN Did you find the inquirer role more difficult to perform than you thought it would be? Or did it feel quite natural? Often times people who have had previous training have some difficulty. Their old training interferes with new learning. What do you think? Before we get into the new material, let's take a moment to review the list of inquirer leads we developed in the last film. 

00:49:40
• Thinking? Feeling? Bodily Reactions? • Want to say? Risks involved? • Want other to see you? How other saw you? • Hoped would happen? Any images? • What did you think the other thought? • What effect did the other’s physical appearance have on you? • Did other know how you felt? • What were you tempted to say? • How had you hoped the other would behave or respond? • How had you hoped the other would not behave or respond? • How had you yourself wanted to behave? • Were you satisfied with your behavior? • What got in the way of your being the way you wanted to be? • What were the imagined outcomes? 

00:49:40
NARRATOR Thinking? Feeling? Bodily Reactions? Want to say? Risks involved? Want other to see you? How other saw you? Hoped would happen? Any images? What did you think the other thought? What affected the other’s physical appearance have on you? Did other know how you felt? What were you tempted to say? How had you hoped the other would behave or respond? How had you hoped the other would not behave or respond? How had you yourself wanted to behave? Were you satisfied with your behavior? What got in the way of your being the way you wanted to be? What were the imagined outcomes? 

00:50:30
HENYA KAGAN Now, we are going to move from counselor or interviewer recall to client recall. Where the people who presented their concerns are given an opportunity to review their tape while other members have the chance to practice the inquirer role. First, however, try practicing the inquirer role with the client on film. Pretend that this client has recorded the session with his counselor. He and his counselor have asked you to review the tape with the client. Notice that we will not show you any of the tape he is watching and recall your focus is on the process as described by the participants. You actually don't have to see the tape to conduct the productive recall session. 

00:51:20
[sil.] 

00:51:25
 This is the third time I've seen him, I really like him. I think he's terrific. But TV really shook me up. I guess having that camera staring at me really got to me. 

00:51:40
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:51:45
 What I was feeling here was just plain old anxiety. 

00:51:50
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:51:55
[sil.] 

00:52:00
 At that point, I guess I was kind of hinting and hoping he'd pick it up, you know. 

00:52:05
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:52:10
[sil.] 

00:52:15
 I just didn't know if I could bring myself to tell him what was really on my mind. I was afraid of what his reactions might be if I really leveled with him. 

00:52:25
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:52:30
 Well, I, I think I was afraid he get mad. Reject me. 

00:52:40
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:52:45
 I don't know. I guess I sort of imagined him walking out and leaving me all alone. I'd suddenly feel abandoned. Really awful feeling. 

00:53:00
If you were his inquirer, what would you say? 

00:53:05
HENYA KAGAN Now, let's practice client recall with the members of your group. 

00:53:05
Remain in the same group Retrieve the tapes on which the two clients in your group (C and D) were recorded. • You should have two (or three) people (clients) with their taped session and two counselors who are not in the recordings the clients have • Each participant gets ten to fifteen minutes in the inquirer role and a few minutes of feedback on their role as inquirers 

00:53:10
NARRATOR Remain in the same group you were in during counselor or interview recall and retrieve the tapes on which the two clients in your group, C and D, were recorded. You should then have two or in the case of a group of five, three. People who presented the concern, the clients together with the tape session and two counselors who are not in the recordings the clients have. As before, each participant gets 10 to 15 minutes in the inquirer role and a few minutes of feedback on the role as inquirers. 

00:53:45
If the first tape is of client C2, • The first inquirer of the client C2 can be client D2 • The second inquirer of client C2 can be counselor A1 • Until each person has been an inquirer 

00:53:45
NARRATOR If the first tape is of client C two, then the first inquirer of the client C two can be client D two. The second inquirer of client C two can be counselor A one and so on until each person in the recall has been an inquirer in a client recall session. 

00:54:05
HENYA KAGAN Let's take a moment to remind those of you who are about to be inquirers that it may be very tempting to start counseling the person reviewing the tape. Try to resist this temptation. Remember, your purpose as inquirer is not to solve their problems but to help them become aware of their unspoken thoughts and feelings during the interview including the thoughts, expectations and feelings about the counselor. Remember, we are trying to enable the client to elaborate on the thoughts and feelings he or she had during the recorded session. Mechanically firing inquirer leads at the client without carefully listening to what he or she tells us may not be seen as encouraging. It's important that you'd be a good listener by communicating to the inquiry both verbally and nonverbally that you are paying close attention. In essence, the inquirer role requires not just the inquirer leads but the person who is intensely interested in what the inquiree says. At the end of the recall session, we will meet again as a class. Okay, now go ahead and practice client recall. How did it go? Did the clients devote a lot of time to wondering about how the counselor perceive them as theory predicted? What were the client's concerns about the counselor? Did you get any evidence that the way the client was relating to the counselor was in someway parallel to the content area? Could any of the client's comments during recall been usefully stated in the interview itself? As inquirers, did you have some difficulty staying with the process? Did you spend more time than you wanted to on content? If so, don't worry. This is a familiar experience for many IPR students. Just remember, the inquirer role is different from that of counselor. As you practice the inquirer role, you may find yourself feeling somewhat stiff and unnatural. Any new set of skills is likely to seem awkward than mechanical at first yet the role need not be a mechanical one. In fact, communicating your own sincere interest and excitement is a very important characteristic of effective inquirer behavior. Now, unless your instructor has a different structure for you to follow. We urge you to return to your original recording group and make a new tape with the same person you first interviewed remaining in the same roles of client and counselor. This will be an opportunity to see what it's like to interact with the same person after each of you has now had a recall session based on the previous interaction. Record a new 10 to 15-minute interaction and then return to the large group so that we can discuss the concept of mutual recall. 

00:57:20
[sil.] 

00:57:45
HENYA KAGAN Before discussing how to conduct mutual recall sessions, let's now return to our workshop group for a few minutes. 

00:57:55
JOE Norm(ph), every time I seemed to recall, I noticed that you hardly ever look at the, ah, monitor. You kind of sit up to one side and to the back of it. Can you explain that to us? 

00:58:10
NORM Yes. Uhm, I prefer not to watch the, the, the monitor, the TV set. Uhm, for one thing I find myself making judgments about what I'm seeing and I don't wanna do that. But there's another reason. Ah, the TV monitor has the most superficial of stories, the really exciting story is the story that the person sitting next to me has to tell. That's the exciting story and so I watch that person just to sort of remind me of, of, of where the excitement is, where the interesting story is going to be coming from. There's another very practical, uhm, reason for not watching the monitor and watching the person. You know, I want the person to stop the tape but if the person doesn't, if it's going on long time person hasn't stop the tape. I watch them so as they start grimacing or moving or even start mumbling. Now, I don’t call their attention to or I don't say hey I noticed your moving and stuff. I don’t' want them to become that aware of my watching them but that's a cue to me. And if they haven't stop the tape, at that point I might say, ah, hey hold it there anything happening on the tape at that point? 

00:59:15
 So if you do interrupt it then you ask a very general open in a kind of question. 

00:59:20
NORM Right, right. 

00:59:20
 Okay. I think I understand now. 

00:59:20
 You know just one question of procedure. Norm(ph), I noticed during the mutual recall sometimes the people would talk to one another, other times to the inquirer. 

00:59:30
NORM Yeah, I am-- that happens all the time. Sometimes they seem to be more comfortable telling the inquirer during the mutual recall and sometimes, ah, they tell each other and I don't encourage or discourage either way. 

00:59:40
BLENDA I've noticed that you use a lot of follow-up kinds of questions. When \somebody told you how she felt, you said you think your client knew that you felt that way and when she answered, you then came back with another question. Ah, do you think that had any effect on you. And after that, another one yet, ah, where did you want the interaction to go from there. So it seemed that you ask several questions in kind of a logical order. 

01:00:10
NORM Ah, yes. Ah, several of the inquirer leads lend themselves to follow up questions. Uhm, well, for instance, ah, what was the other person’s thinking could be followed with, uhm, what did you want the other person to think? Ah, did you have any plans or, or strategies for encouraging the other person to, to think that way? Uhm, how did you feel could be followed with, ah, is that the way you wanted to feel which could be followed with, ah, do you think the other person knew you felt that way? Ah, and how did that affect you? Uhm, uhm, oh, depending on the response you get, you can follow any number of ways. Ah, ah, for instance the person says, ah, I wanted him to know I understood his pain and yet I didn't. Ah, did you recall what kept you from communicating what you wanted to communicate. Ah, similarly, ah, how did you think the other person felt could be followed with is that the way you wanted the other person to feel. Ah, how did you want the other person to feel. Uhm, what got in the way of your implementing your, your plan or, or desire for the other person. 

01:01:25
 Yeah, I think those are all really useful. Uhm, on the other hands something I found is sometimes the person catches on really quickly and the inquirer hardly assess any leads at all. 

01:01:35
NORM Right, right. 

01:01:35
 Well, there's something that I don't understand. How do you know when you've been away from the tape too long and you're no longer doing recall? 

01:01:45
NORM Well, my rule of thumb is, is really quite simple. Ah, when the person I'm doing recall with begins to get into lengthy stories, begins speculating, ah, in general gets away from what was going on on the tape. Ah, then I asked them, do you recall what was happening to you at that moment on the tape. And if they say no, it's all right. How do we go back to the tape then. Uhm, people sometimes wanna know, "Oh, gee why don't you allow them to generalize and go beyond and so on?" Well, from my point of view, what's on that videotape is as good as sample of behavior for that person to study himself or herself as any other sample, why not stick with that. 

01:02:25
 But look, could a person make a mistake by not following through enough? 

01:02:35
BLENDA Yeah, I've noticed that there are often things that end conversations that really shouldn't. They should be some more follow up on them. Like when somebody says, I was feeling anxious. Sometimes we let that go and we could use a follow up lead or I was feeling uncomfortable. When that's really not the end of their thought. Those don't have to be end statement then, do they? 

01:02:55
JOE Blenda(ph), I'm not sure what you mean. 

01:03:00
BLENDA You could ask, what about the camera? What did you want the camera to see you or not to see? 

01:03:05
NORM Or who did you imagine was on the other side of the camera? 

01:03:10
 Or the word anxiety. What were you thinking? What were you feeling? What was your body doing? Did the other person recognize your anxiety? 

01:03:20
NORM Right. All of these can be very logical follow-ups to such statements. Okay, well, now let us practice the role. First, we need to get something on videotape that has some meaning to us. Let's pair off and, ah, videotape each pair in which one person either presents a concern to the other. All were two people may find they have a concern that they share and, and can discuss back and forth. Ah, another possibility would be for one person to give feedback to the other. You know, that is something I really like about you or the other side does. Something I've been meaning to tell you, ah, friend. Ah, any of those things but something that has some meaning to us, all right. Let's make a videotape and then we do recall with that. Ah, Joe(ph) you wanna pull the camera over and let's just rearrange chair so that you can... 

01:04:15
[sil.] 

01:04:30
NORM Okay. Uhm, we now have a videotape with each of us on it. Ah, let's first practice individual recall and Joe(ph) you were in the first pair. All right, so we've have you be the first inquiry. And Blenda(ph) you're not on until later in the tape so I guess you'd be the first inquirer. Yours is, is the important role. Yours is the one that's gonna be keeping eye on studying, critiquing and so on. Uhm, I would start off by even though Joe(ph) knows what it is we're doing and what it's all about but if you could practice for you to start off by giving him that introduction to each feeling telling him about it and you'll sit in back of you, uhm, here and we'll serve as, as consultants to you so that anytime that you get stuck, you can just stop everything and pretend Joe(ph) is not there and turn around to us and say, "Hey, I'm stuck at this point. What should I say, what could I say? Or I don't like what I just did say," okay. Uhm, one question, in terms of our interrupting you, in terms of our giving you feedback. Do you want us to wait until the end of your recall session or do you want us to interrupt whenever we see you doing something that, that doesn't seem to fit in the role? 

01:05:40
BLENDA I'd rather have 10, 15 minutes for myself, uhm, and I can turn to you if I need to and then afterwards, if you give me feedback or ideas, things that I may have felt, that would be helpful. 

01:05:55
NORM Fine. 

01:05:55
BLENDA Okay, Joe(ph), you know that mind is faster than the voice and there were probably lots of things going on in your head while you were doing the interview. 

01:06:05
During mutual recall, both participants, the counselor and the client, review the tape together • Stop the tape at any point 

01:06:05
HENYA KAGAN So far, you have practiced both interviewer or counselor recall and client recall. Now you can learn a third type of recall process called mutual recall. 

01:06:20
NARRATOR During mutual recall, both participants, the counselor and the client review the tape together. They are instructed to stop the tape at any point to express how they were thinking or feeling. 

01:06:30
Mutual recall is unique and powerful because: • The participants can now explore the unspoken messages - The meta-communication that went on between them • They are now able to communicate directly - Thoughts and feelings 

01:06:30
NARRATOR Mutual recall is unique and powerful because unlike interviewer or client recall, the participants can now explore the unspoken messages or meta-communication that went on between them as they interacted with each other. They are now able to communicate directly to each other where their thoughts and feelings had been during the interaction. The mutual recall experience helps the participants become aware of how each person influence the interaction. And what each person wanted or expected from the other. In normal conversation, this information is usually unspoken and most often is transmitted outside of our awareness. In mutual recall, the participants become aware of this important material as they acknowledge and describe what they were thinking and feeling during the recorded interaction. 

01:07:25
HENYA KAGAN The inquirer role and mutual recall is similar to the role in interviewer or client recall but with the added dimension of having all the group members including the counselor and client present during the recall session. Sometimes it's easier to have the inquirer do the mechanical work of stopping the tape. But only when asked to do so by one or both of the participants. When the tape is stopped and a participant comments, the inquirer can proceed with questions as an individual recall. However, the inquirer can now also turn to the other participant and ask. 

01:08:05
NARRATOR Did you know your partner was thinking or feeling that? What did you think your partner was experiencing at that moment? Do you recall what you yourself were thinking of feeling, etcetera? 

01:08:20
HENYA KAGAN In all likelihood, the participants will stop and talk directly to each other without referring their comments to you, the inquirer. If they are doing well, that's fine. If it ain't broke, then don't fix it. Your physical presence is important and what's more, if they drift off into the content of this session. You can bring them back to the process between them. You also may notice that they talk only about some areas and not others. For instance, they talk openly in recall about their feelings but not about their thoughts. You can then interject that some point and ask, did you have any strategy about where you wanted the session to go or any other thoughts during the recording? Now watch this next mini ad and pretend you are the inquirer in a mutual recall session. That is, you are reviewing a videotape with both participants in the room with you. 

01:09:15
 Think, I don't know if there's any problem with that. You know, I really figured that, uhm, I don't, maybe we should (inaudible ) enough. 

01:09:25
 Stop please. I wasn't sure what you really wanted from me there. I just wasn't sure how far he wanted to go in talking about this. I think I was afraid to push further than he wanted me to. 

01:09:40
 That's funny because I interpreted what you were doing to me but you didn't understand what I want. You know, I thought she'd miss the whole point what I was trying to tell her. 

01:09:50
HENYA KAGAN If you were the inquirer, what would you say? In the next mini ad, pretend that you interrupted the participants. One of the few instances were you might. See if you can figure out why we had you interrupted them and what you might say to them. 

01:10:15
 Just wanted to break out, shall we? She's always talks about... 

01:10:15
 Stop please. I wonder if I had said, I don't think it's your girlfriend's fault. What would you have said to me? 

01:10:25
 I probably would have said something like, ah, what? 

01:10:35
HENYA KAGAN Mutual recall affords all participants an unusual opportunity for people who was markedly different cultural backgrounds to learn about each other. To learn the meaning each attributes to words and events and to become aware of the aspirations and expectations each has for themselves and for others. In fact, mutual recall has been used by many groups to facilitate better understanding. It's been use in New Guinea to help Australian instructors understand Papuan students. In Israel, to help medical students learn to understand and communicate with Bedouin patients. And in Illinois, to help white teachers better understand black students. Clearly, IPR offers a unique opportunity for people from different backgrounds to learn about each other. But in a sense, don't we all have unique cultures? Does someone raised in a wealthy neighborhood in New Delhi really have the same cultural perspective as someone from small agricultural village in the same country? Does someone raised in Manhattan New York have the same cultural perspective as someone raise in rural South Dakota. Even if we are from the same neighborhood, is my culture really the same as yours? Our message then is that we can engage most fully in the recall process by assuming that everyone has unique perspectives. We can maximize what we learned from mutual recall by entering the process with an eye toward discovering each other's unique culture and perspective. In order to understand mutual recall completely and become confident with the skills involved, we now invite you to experience mutual recall. 

01:12:20
Return to the group of last tape if A and B are first then, C begins recall with A and B D continues mutual recall with A and B A and B each conduct recall for C and D with A first 

01:12:20
NARRATOR Return please to the group in which you made your last tape. If person A and B are first on the tape, person C begins recall with A and B for about 15 minutes. Person D then, continues mutual recall with A and B. Afterwards, A and B each conduct recall sessions for C and D with A going first. 

01:12:45
HENYA KAGAN When you have completed mutual recall, return to the larger group to discuss the next step. 

01:12:55
[sil.] 

01:13:00
HENYA KAGAN What did you learn from mutual recall? Did you see any evidence that people influence or program each other in subtle ways? Or that people react to each other using old habitual patterns of behavior that may not be the most appropriate given the present situation. 

01:13:20
[sil.] 

01:13:25
HENYA KAGAN Now, if time permits, it will be useful to take a break from recording and view some of the candid tapes of counselors, client in mutual recall. If you are able to review more of the films, stop the tape here and return to this point when you are done. Your instructor will determine which tapes to view. If time is limited however, you may continue on. 

01:13:55
[sil.] 

01:14:00
HENYA KAGAN Now, repeat the procedure we use to learn the inquirer role. If videotape equipment is available, try videotape for counselor or client and then mutual recall just as we did before. If possible, we also suggest that you record with a new partner. This time, form new groups for recording and later reviewing the tapes. As before, after you have made your tapes, you will return here and clients will switch groups during the counselor recall session. Before you make your audio or videotapes however, let me make a few suggestions. Remember in the introductory tape when Doctor Kagan said that we live in communities before we had language. Well, is the ability to talk without language still with us? Is there a subtle system by which we read each other? When you are either the counselor or client especially perhaps the counselor, try to be sensitive to what images go through your mind as you talk to the other person. Is it possible that these images or fantasies are part of the other person's communication? In your imagination, let the other person take you by the hand. Where do they lead you? What did they show you? What happens to you if you go with them? What happens to them? Is it possible that many of the things that were going on in your mind during the interaction could be said during the recall session? Is that also possible many of those same thoughts could have been verbalized during the interaction itself? For example, let's imagine that during the interaction you are able to pull yourself aside mentally and ask yourself. 

01:15:50
• "What's going on here?" • "What's going on between me and this other person?" • "What assumptions am I making about them?" • "What assumptions does this other person seem to be making about me?" • "What do I want to achieve in this interaction?" • "Does the other person know what I want, or what I'm after?" • "If I'm confused by what the other person is saying, • "Can I risk asking them or telling them of my confusion?" • "What's going on here?" • "What's going on between me and this other person?" • "What assumptions am I making about them?" • "What assumptions does this other person seem to be making about me?" 

01:15:50
NARRATOR What's going on here? What's going on between me and this other person? What assumptions am I making about them and what assumptions does this other person seem to be making about me? What do I want to achieve in this interaction? Does the other person know what I want, or what I'm after? If I'm confused by what the other person is saying or by their reactions, can I risk asking them or telling them of my confusion? Again, these are some ideas that might deepen the experience for you. But don't let them confuse you. Just see if you find them useful during this next round of taping. Why don't you go ahead now and make your tapes and then return to the large group. 

01:16:45
[sil.] 

01:16:50
HENYA KAGAN After you have made the tape, client should change groups. Conduct counselor recall sessions and then return here. 

01:17:00
[sil.] 

01:17:05
HENYA KAGAN Okay, now you have completed your counselor recall sessions. Remain in the same groups. Retrieve the tapes containing the client's recording and conduct client recall sessions. Again, a note of caution, during the client recall session. Stay with the process between the client and counselor. Focus on the assumptions made by the client and the feelings that client had in the session itself. Try not to drift into the content of the client's concern. Remember, we are recalling or debriefing the recorded session, not conducting a new client interview. When you have completed client recall, return to the large group. 

01:17:50
[sil.] 

01:17:55
HENYA KAGAN At this point, we would like to suggest that you make a new recording with the same counselor and client pairs, either continue with your original discussion if you choose or introduce a new theme but stay in the same roles. At the end of the recording, go immediately into a mutual recall session with the counselor and client together. When you have completed the recordings and then the mutual recall sessions, come back here. 

01:18:25
[sil.] 

01:18:30
HENYA KAGAN What is next then? We suggest you view any of the tapes that are relevant to your current or future work. 

01:18:35
Review tapes relevant to your work •Therapy • Couples • Education • Schools • Management and supervision • Group process 

01:18:40
NARRATOR The tapes of therapy, couples, those related to education, to schools, to management and supervision or to group process. 

01:18:45
The Health Team Tape • Form groups of 5 to 8 people 

01:18:50
NARRATOR After you viewed the health team tape, you might find it worthwhile to form groups of five to eight people. 

01:18:55
One member of the group = camera operator during recording then Camera operator = inquirer of the group 

01:18:55
NARRATOR Have one member of the group serve as camera operator during the recording and then as inquirer for the group after approximately one half hour of taping. 

01:19:05
HENYA KAGAN The content of the session could focus on you in what you wish you could change in your own small group behavior. What do you think you'd do too much of? What behavior do you wish you could use or use more often than you do? An hour or so on such recall is usually well worth your time. Another exercise that most people find valuable is to study yourself in a teaching, learning situation. After viewing the junior high school classroom tape, a member of your group who has a content or skill that might be of interest to the rest of the group serves as teacher. Another member operates the camera and then serves as inquirer in a mutual recall session of students and teacher. Even if it's not often that you are in a position to be a student, you will probably find this experience valuable. Doctor Kagan mentioned transfer of learning in the introductory tape. To study yourself interacting with another participant in this training is certainly beneficial. However the risk is that, what you have learned will not be transferred to your real life experiences outside this training setting. To help prevent that from happening, we urge you to setup experiences outside the workshop setting in order to transfer your learning to your everyday work and life. You can use IPR with any of the people with whom you live and work who would be willing to engage in a tape session. After the session, individual in mutual recall can be done with the help of an outside inquirer. For example... 

01:20:50
Medical students Could interview volunteer patients Then conduct a mutual recall session Counselors Could interview someone seeking help Followed by a recall session Law students could interview clients or review recorded mock-trials Supervisors could make recordings of on-the-job interactions Follow them with recall sessions Teachers could use the mutual recall process with an entire classroom 

01:20:50
NARRATOR Medical students who are not yet in clinical practice could interview volunteer patients who have recently received medical care and then conduct a mutual recall session. Counselors could interview someone seeking help with a concern appropriate for the counselor's level of training followed by a recall session. Law students could interview clients or review recorded mock-trials. Supervisors could make audio recordings of on-the-job interactions or staff meetings and follow them with recall sessions. And teacher could use the mutual recall process after recorded session with an entire classroom. 

01:21:30
HENYA KAGAN Whatever area your instructor decides to focus on. The degree to which IPR will be valuable in your future depends on your decision to apply what you have learned. Our hope is that you have gain new interpersonal skills. Become less reactive to difficult people and situations. And most importantly, began to see and appreciate the wealth of information that lies just below the surface of our interpersonal interactions. This information, if you are willing to acknowledge and make use of it can greatly enhance you interpersonal effectiveness. Good luck.
