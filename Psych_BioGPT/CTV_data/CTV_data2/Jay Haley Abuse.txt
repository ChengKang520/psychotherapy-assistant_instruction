filmed by Madeleine Richeport-Haley edited by Madeleine Richeport-Haley & Jay Haley 

00:00:05
JAY HALEY (1923-2007) was known as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, strategic therapy, and brief therapy. His early work was in collaboration with some of the foremost thinkers of our time such as, Gregory Bateson and Milton H. Erickson, MD. He was a professor at Stanford University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, and the California School of Professional Psychology. He published more than 20 books and over a hundred papers.

00:00:35
JAY HALEY I'll present a particular view of adolescents, which is the social view. There are so many ways to think about them, and I'll present one particular way of doing therapy, which, uh, is very problem-focused. One of the, uh, primary issues, I think, is whether you think about, uh, adolescence in terms of psychopathology and diagnosis or whether you think of it as a human dilemma, or that I can be. And I think this makes a great difference in the way you work. Uh, there's a tendency for a family orientation to think of these as human problems that everybody has, just some people have them more extreme. If you think terms of, uh, psychopathology I think it confines you in various ways. Let me give you an example. Uh, years ago when Salvador Minuchin was seeing, um, one of his first anorectics, a little girl, a walking skeleton like they can be, he, uh, saw the family and then he played the tape to the staff and a couple of the residents said, uh, they wished he'd mentioned this case because they were collecting cases of anorexia nervosa and they would like to have this one in the sample. And Dr.]Minchin said, "This is not a case of anorexia nervosa. This is a little girl who won't eat." Because he knew what to do about that. Nobody knows what to do with psychopathology really. But if you translate it into some operational terms, I think you do. The, uh, way I'll present it, adolescence in terms of the family and stages of family life, which is one way to think of it, I'll also present a particular kind of therapy that I think at this meeting there's more consensus developing about therapy and how to do it. Probably by the next one we can debate and discuss it even. Well, I don't think we could last time at all. It was like a cafeteria. People came up and got their bit of therapy. But there are still differences that surprise me. I am surprised when people still ask people how they feel, because I've been away from that for quite a while now. The idea that expressing feelings is good for people and people who, uh, do that are surprised if you don't do that so, uh, there are still differences. Let me give you an instance, I think an interesting example of a strategic therapy approach that was difficult for a person to understand. There was a woman with a, an adolescent boy who was wetting the bed, and the mother had devoted her life to helping this boy not wet the bed, and had had him to various therapists and various procedures and she brought him to Neil Schiff, the therapist I'll be showing later today and said that she'd like his help in stopping this boy from wetting the bed. So Dr. Schiff said, uh, "Are you willing to do anything to help him stop?" And she said yes and he said, "Well, I want you to give the boy 50 dollars every time he wets the bed." The mother said, "All right," and she did and the boy earned about 150 dollars and then he stopped wetting the bed and she went to her pediatrician and she was telling him about this and the pediatrician said, "This is absolutely crazy, that you don't reward a child for the behavior you're trying to stop," and she said, "Well, I don't care, it worked." So there's still misunderstandings of the strategic approach. What can seem obvious isn't obvious to some people. One of the ways, uh, to think about adolescence is as a stage in our lifecycle and I think, uh, a family life cycle is a useful way to work. 

00:04:50
Family Life Cycle Adolescence as a Stage of the Lifecycle 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY I outlined years ago in, uh, in Uncommon Therapy and I still think it's a good way to word it. It's based on the premise that psychological problems don't occur randomly in the life of a family. They cluster at certain points. You get more problems at certain stages of family life. There's about six of them. You get them in a marriage. You get them at childbirth, at starting school, in adolescence, when it's time to leave home and at retirement and old age. And of all of them, adolescence is the most ambiguous one because it isn't clear as a stage. But one way to think about therapy is to define it as helping people pass these stages. Marriage is usually followed by the birth of children and after that the children go out into the community and go to school and one stage leads to the next and there are certain tasks or functions of each one. Actually the, the stages aren't that neat. I was attempting a longitudinal one, study one time and I kept finding that people would have children and then get married and this complicates a research design when you're trying...like you can't believe. So there's a tremendous variety in this case but when the, a person has a problem at each of these stages, I think it's best to focus on the social situation rather than on the person, to assume it's an organizational problem. For example, if you get a young couple right after marriage who have problems or a symptom in one of them, I think it almost always involves the in-laws, that is part of the early stages of marriage can disengage some in-laws and that's the way to think about the therapeutic problem when it walks in. 

00:07:00
Hierarchy Changes Across the Life Cycle 

00:07:00
JAY HALEY One of the, uh, problems for each of these stages is that the hierarchy in the family changes with each one, that, um, when parents have a child and they get a, a relationship hierarchically worked out, then the child grows up and the whole hierarchy has to shift to adapt to a child shifting to becoming a peer. Then as that gets straightened out the parents get older and child begins to take care of the parents and that's a tremendous hierarchical shift in most families. So, it's a difficult, uh, shift for most people but if you, uh, think of it this way, you think of how to help them get past the goal or have a goal of getting past this stage of problems into the next stage of problems and each, uh, each stage has its own in its way. For example, if you're dealing with, uh, a young couple who just got married and have a problem, they don't necessarily present it as a marital problem or as a in-law problem, they present it in terms of whatever is bothering them at the moment. Let me give you an example. I had a case of a, a young woman who educated me about therapy. She came in with a, a shaking right-hand, trembling involuntarily and intermittently and, uh, it was interfering with her work. She couldn't hold her pencil. It would drop. She went through some very expensive neurological tests to, uh, find out what was wrong and they couldn't find anything wrong. So, she went into therapy with a friend of mine for some months and the problem got worse. So, I was in practice at the time, uh, willing to do some hypnotherapy so he referred her to me to get her over the symptom while he dealt with the problems, which is the way we thought in those days. We didn't think that getting people over the symptom was enough. But at any rate, the pastor on to me and I hypnotized her and she was a very good subject. And, uh, I suggested that her left hand begin to shake and it began to shake, and as it did the right-hand stopped shaking, which seem to be an indicator that wasn't a neurological problem. And that was a very inexpensive way to find that out, which is why I think it's helpful to learn hypnosis for simple things like that sometimes. But at any rate, I woke her up with her left hand shaking and she said, "Now my left hand is shaking." And I said, "Well isn't that better? You don't hold a pencil in that hand." And she said, "I don't want either hand to shake." So I put her back in a trance and said the right sorts of things about her hands would only shake when necessary or something and then I woke her up and talked with her and asked her as I would with symptoms, "What's gonna happen if this gets worse?" And, uh, she said, "I'll lose my job." And I said, "Well, what if you do lose your job?" And, uh, she said, "Well, my husband will have to go work." And that shifted me from thinking of this as an individual problem to a dyadic problem, which I was trying to do its in those days it was difficult to make that shift sometimes. So, it turns out she married her husband when he was in the Navy and he came out and he couldn't make up his mind whether to go to school or to go to work. Meanwhile, she was supporting him. So, uh, being interested in the wider social unit, I asked how her parents were dealing with this and she said her parents were opposed to the marriage and in fact, she said her mother called her every day and said, "Are you coming home today?" And she would say to her mother, "Mother, I have my own place now. I'm married." And her mother would say, "That won't last." Then the next day the mother would call again and say, "Are you coming home today?" So I thought that was relevant to the girl having a shaking hand, but it isn't information that just popped out. You really have to search for it and as I thought about what to do about this, I brought the husband in and, I also realized the husband's situation. He was in a place where her parents didn't approve of him and they didn't approve of him not working but they wouldn't approve if he went to college and the wife had to support him in school, and if he got a job it wouldn't be a job that would be good enough for them because he didn't have the skills. So he was just oscillating, doing nothing really. And, uh, he couldn't conceive of functioning except in relation to her parents because they were both so powerful in the situation. But that's an example of disengaging of the tasks, disengaging a young couple from their in-laws and as you do that the symptoms go away. Actually, in this case I did some remarkable therapy and she was transformed. Her hand stopped shaking, the husband went to work, the parents began to support the marriage. But what happened was I think perhaps independent of me. What she did was get pregnant, and as she got pregnant her husband had to go to work and her parents who had wanted her home didn't want her back with a baby, so they shifted and began to support this marriage and I happily took the credit for the success of the case. 

00:12:30
Therapy Is Getting People At One Stage The Problem Onto The Next Stage 

00:12:35
JAY HALEY But I think it's an example of how people go through a stage and they get passed it into the next stage and, uh, this happens often naturally and sometimes with the help of a therapist, if you're thinking that way. So that starting school, or the next stage after getting married is often having children and, uh, one of the problems with children is childbirth is often, usually a very happy time but some people get very upset and depressed around childbirth and, uh, it's not clear to some therapists what the goal is, I think, of getting them past that stage. I think the most severe problems come when people come into a family and when people leave a family. That's when you get really crazy and depressed behavior. 

00:13:30
The most severe problems come when people enter or leave the family 

00:13:35
JAY HALEY And the birth of a child raises all sorts of issues about the commitment within the marriage, but one of the things that used used to be done is a woman would have her baby and get depressed and she would be hospitalized, without concern for who is going to take care of the baby while she was in the hospital because they weren't thinking in that broad unit. Usually the husband takes the baby to his family because he has to have somebody take care of it, so he essentially moved back with his family with the baby. The wife is in the hospital learning about what it means to be a mother and then she comes out and when she comes out she almost has to fight to get her baby back because the baby is built into their in-laws structure now and everybody's very fond of it. And if she does fight to get the baby back people say well she's upset and shall go back in the hospital again. So you started two rescinded this problem which is caused by that way of helping and I've heard everybody has a legitimate position. I've heard grandmothers say, "I'm not sure I want my grandchild taken care of by a mental patient," referring to the child's mother, so that the stigma of the treatment has a large effect on the destiny of the family, really. And I think in all the stages that the drastic, uh, step to take somebody out of the family and put them somewhere for a while and then try to put them back. it has a remarkable effect. And here's something you probably haven't known about, it was in the 1950s everybody was watching animals. When, when we began to look when family became to be an issue, everybody was looking at animals in their natural environment at the same time, just like we look at psychotic patients in their natural environment or other patients. But at any rate, there was a woman who was known as the goal woman. Everybody had their own animal that they followed in the world, like Jane Goodall and her chimps or something like that. usually it's women who observe them. Maybe they... I don't know why. But at any rate, uh, there's a surprising number of women in that profession of examining animal behavior in their natural environment. But anyhow, there was a woman known as the goal woman and what she did sort of like an experiment really, they began to do that, if she would take a kid out of the goat group, keep it out for 24 hours and put it back and they would have nothing, the goats would have nothing to do with that kid. it would be excluded. It was a strange kid from then on. And they never could quite figure out whether it was the human contact or smell that was doing it or just the act of taking it out of the family and putting it back again and we were noticing at that time that there were real problems if you took an adolescent, for example and put him or her into a hospital, when they go back they're different and the family is different and they're treated different. Often, uh, parents close up and excluded the kid and say why don't you just keep him, rather than taken back and integrate them in which is part of the task. But at any rate, I think that at each of these stages the most drastic step is to take somebody out of the family, even for a short period of time. and I think we're slowly learning not to do that. But the adolescent period is the most ambiguous stage. It's not clear event like going to school or having something happen. 

00:17:10
Adolescence is a Transitional Stage Preparing for Leaving Home 

00:17:15
JAY HALEY It's transition stage really that, the success of the is when the kid leaves home and manages successfully to live outside the family. To do that, they really have to learn how to work for go to school and get trained so they can learn to support himself and they have to establish some social base outside the family so that they have a place of their own and those steps, they're essentially what Freud said that you need love and work. And most adolescent problems, around difficulties in those areas and difficulties of such a nature that they have trouble leaving home. the parents, uh, have real problems in accepting this, this change in the kid as they establish themselves more independently. It's a, a situation that the parents only are successful parents if the kids are out and on their own and having their own families and so on. Usually about the time the children reach adolescence, the parents are in difficulty in various ways, often with each other. There, there's divorce, there's threats of divorce, there's saying he'll only stay together for the children and after the children are older, then as the children get older they're faced with whether to separate or not, so the children are built right into the marriage by the way they behave. Often they're at a stage in their careers at this time which is important. If parents could be, uh, objective, rational, cool and deal with the difficulties of an adolescent becoming independent it would be all right, but the parents are in such trouble themselves often that they can hardly deal with the kids. Usually at this time in the career, man or woman is, uh, discovering they're not gonna make that great career they thought they would, they're going to go on doing what they've been doing or sometimes they are making great career. They're so busy there never home and can't deal with the kids, so the career gets into it just like everything else does. With the, uh, parents at this time, to, there also beginning to take care of their own parents and struggle with them is that shift changes and often older parents don't want to be accepted, don't want to accept being taking care of by the young people and put somewhere. One of the, uh, problems I think we all face is people are living forever now and that stage of old age is a long stage that nobody anticipated marriage is a long marriage that nobody ever anticipated. We have a couple, uh, coming in who were married in 1926 and that was a long time ago. They come in for marital problems. You'd think they would've solved them by now. They haven't. We have another couple in their 60s, the kids grown and gone, and they came in with marital problems and we found out that there was a 92-year-old mother-in-law, the wife's mother who was preventing the husband from living in the house with his wife, so is difficult to deal with their marriage if he couldn't even move in. And so those of you who think that mother-in-law problems will go away soon, as people live forever they don't go away. They continue to be an issue for a long time. But at any rate, uh, not only are the parents involved in career difficulties and difficulties with each other and involved in some affairs and all that, they're involved in Saudi Arabia. At the time the kids an adolescent, the father or mother disappears these days because of what happens in society and if they don't, they tend to, uh, at this time get into trouble over marriage and get divorced and then the kid is living with, a, a parent and another parent living elsewhere that they have to adapt to and then as they adapt to that, they lose the other, one of the spouses marries again and the kid then has a new stepfather or stepmother to deal with and then has new grandparents to deal with and often there's another divorce and the kids then have a whole new set to begin to deal with and they have siblings that they are involved with when they haven't been raised by them and a lot of the sexual activity one can suspect is because these blended families have adolescence mixing together at ages when they're pretty active sexually. But at any rate, uh, it's a difficult time for the parents is what I'm saying, two, to be able to deal objectively with kids who are having their own difficulties. 

00:22:05
Adolescents Try To Be Helpful to Stabilize the Family 

00:22:05
JAY HALEY It's also, uh, a time when I think the best way to think about as adolescents making trouble is that they're being helpful. They're trying to stabilize the situation and its something the parents have to give up, is letting the kids help them resolve their problems, so the kids are free to go about their business. Let me give you an example of a tape that I've sometimes played in which a young woman is 15 years old, she runs away and stays overnight with her boyfriend, making a big hullabaloo with the family and, uh, it's a family with a stepmother and the natural father living separately. so when she does this, she has a big fight with her mother, goes off to her natural father, can't stand that there and comes back home and in the process the stepfather and mother pulled together to deal with this problem daughter and she stabilizers that marriage, excludes the natural father from the struggle and the family then has worked out its problems and I think it's the best way to think about adolescence is to look at what, what the function is that their misbehavior in the social situation is positive, because I think they do help and they often sacrifice themselves for helping. Or at least I think that's the way you can think about it helpfully. That was one of the nice things about assuming that people help each other and that's the problem is that you like the people but are. If you're thinking an adolescent is helping the parents, you like the adolescent instead of thinking she's just a pain, or him and it makes therapy easier if you like the people you're working with. 

00:23:50
A Good Theory for Therapy Should be Positive 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY So you should have theories about motivation to help you like the people you're working with, I think. but the adolescent he really has to go through quite a change. They have to give up being a child. They have to become a, begin to try to become an adult. I have to accept some responsibility, the authority of other people and they have no ceremony for it. You know, many societies, where a young person reaches a certain age they put them through a ritual, often a very painful one and after that the, the kid is part of the men's group or women's group and not part of the family as much anymore. Some societies have a way of helping people pass these stages. Our society really doesn't. High school graduation doesn't even have the ceremony of importance that he used to have because people tend to go on to college and it's just accepted that everybody will do this and so on. So, it's a problem which I think therapy comes in to help people with and provides the ritual to help young people leave home, like an initiation ceremony in our society. If you think about it that way, you think about how can you be temporary and how you can do the least harm in a family by helping them go through the ritual which will help the adolescent get out and beyond their own then. One of the, uh, things about adolescents, they tend to have problems... actually many of them don't have problems. We deal with the problems, so we think the whole society is full of problem adolescents, but it's not. There's a lot of people out there enjoying adolescents, the parents enjoying them having a good time together, enjoying new experiences. And we get the ones where there is a problem. But they usually have two extremes, I think. One is, uh, they're either socially withdrawn so they never go out or they never stay home. we tend to get those extremes. I think the unsocial and withdrawn ones are the most difficult in many ways. One of the... Instead of the psychopathological classification, I think, uh, a better one is to classify young people, particularly young adults and I'll present a young adult who didn't get past adolescence. 

00:26:15
Adolescents classified into Troublemakers and the Apathetic. 

00:26:20
JAY HALEY Well, if you think of them as, uh, is divided into the class of troublemakers or the apathetic and the troublemakers are easier in many ways because they force everybody to do something about them. the apathetic ones are different. They just, they sit at home and grow their beards and do nothing and, uh, they can stabilize a family by doing nothing and then when you come in to get something to happen people get upset and, uh, it's a more difficult problem. You don't get the cooperation you do where there's a troublemaker where somebody has to do something about this kid that is bringing so much trouble. But at any rate, I think they have some function often when their socially withdrawn, there was a lonely parent or with parents who leave them there and that they start to move out or do something outside, the parents go unstable and then they stay home to help them work it out but at the other stream, extreme you get them when they're, they're too social. They're just never home. They're out with her friends at all times, often running away or on drugs or whatever is fashionable in their peer group at the time which they should do. They should establish a social base outside the family but often the base that establishes one their parents can't approve of. So the parents approve of them doing things outside the family, but not the things they're doing, so that they're complex kind of negotiations they go through with each other. But at any rate, uh, but there's also ethnic differences that were getting so many of these days. I mean, often were lucky if we can speak the language of the people who come in. Their cultures are so different. 

00:28:00
Multicultural Issues 

00:28:05
JAY HALEY I was just seeing, and I found it funny in a way, there was an Italian family with a 15-year-old daughter who was a big blonde who looks about 25 and her mother who was upset because that daughter wants to date and she says 15-year-old daughter shouldn't date. The daughter says, "Everybody I know dates at 15." So, so what the mother did is she took her, she had had a very strict mother who stayed in Italy. So she took her daughter back to Italy because wanting her mother to straighten her daughter out about how girls don't date at 15 years old. And her mother surprised her by saying, "I think it's great. I think she should date. Times have changed." And this woman was so mad and her mother, who had restricted her for so many years and now encourages her daughter to get out and misbehave. So, you have those problems, particularly the immigrant problems we get in this country where the, the kids adapt very quickly to the, to the customs here but the parents are trying to retain something of the customs of where they come from and the difficult problem for them that requires care, negotiation, asking the family to educate you about their culture and so on. We've had two Sikhs in the last two months, I mean Sikhs with turbans and the whole ideology of India they came in with and in both cases the women got jobs in this country and were doing well and joining the women's movement and the men couldn't get jobs and were collapsing, really. And we find that with a variety of, particularly the central Americans. but at any rate, just to get a family to agree on how one adolescent ought to behave is not always easy. 

00:29:55
Must learn to Deal with Authority and Power 

00:29:55
JAY HALEY But one of the, uh, things about adolescence that I think has to happen and that's what I've mostly emphasized today really, after this general preamble is that they, uh, they have to learn how to deal with authority and power, as they should from being children to being adults. If you think in terms of hierarchy, there's quite a change in hierarchy with this. That is they, they have established a relationship as a child with parents and they have to shift to be more like a peer with parents and that isolation is difficult when they at one moment are taking charge of the parents and at the next moment are absolutely helpless. So nothing consistent can seem to get done. But if you think about hierarchy, which we do a hierarchy of experts, grandparents, parents and children and we take that very seriously, I think, uh, one of the things you are doing with that is recognizing that every organization has people in it who are of different status, have different power and that as is, gets established they work it out and then there's a change and they relieve difficulty. 

00:31:15
Adolescents Take Power by Harming Themselves 

00:31:15
JAY HALEY And then one of the things that happens with adolescence is they, uh, they begin to take power often by harming themselves. And as they do that, the parents begin to have really difficulty exis-, exerting any authority and that's when the community gets involved in those problems. Debtors if you get a young person who shoots up dope and the parents are devastated at the kid shoots up dope, all the kid has to do issued up dope and the parents will back off from any kind of discipline or authority because they don't want them to harm themselves or they threaten suicide or something. I'll show you a 15-year-old who goes through the entire repertoire really of, uh, the reps that an adolescent could make to the parents and it's very difficult for the parents to enforce rules when a kid has more power than they do. We have a young person, for example, a young man who used to sprinkle gasoline around the foundation of the house and then he would sit on the front steps and light matches. his family didn't put a lot of pressure on him. and I think it was a way he took power but it was also way he stabilized the family. He kept those parents pulled together with what can we do with this boy, but it was a dangerous way to do it and sometimes they do dangerous things. 

00:32:45
Think hierarchically and consider coalitions 

00:32:45
JAY HALEY But I think it helps to, uh, to think about a hierarchy. One of the things it does, it helps you to diagnose coalitions if you think hierarchically. You realize when you were joining an adolescent against parents that you're creating the problems you're trying to solve, that you're confusing the hierarchy of the family. And I think many therapists went into the business to help children and adolescents so there is a natural tendency for them to join them against parents. But if you think hierarchically only you realize that you're above the parents as an expert and your joining the kids against them is the same problem you would have in any organization if you're the top manager who joins an employee against middle-management they're in trouble. There's gonna be, uh, upset and violence, maybe so that, uh, if you consider coalitions seriously you, you look for what coalitions are you forming. Are you joining the wife against the husband or the parents against the grandparents or the kids against the parents? Because you can't get out of your position as an expert, even if you don't feel expert, and even if you try to be, uh, a peer with the family. You're not a peer. You're somebody they come to to get over the problems. So, it's something that helps you realize your position in the situation, but it also helps you to distribute the power. There's a, a kind of a laying on of hands of, of whoever you want to give power to, you can do it. You give them authority by the way you behave with them, by who you listen to. 

00:34:30
Trained Community Therapists 

00:34:30
JAY HALEY Let me give you an example. We had a, we used to train people in the community to be therapists. In the 60s when there was a question whether to train the middle class what it was like to be poor or to train the poor to be therapists, because the poor were in fashion in those days. Everybody was helping and we trained some people who were poor to be therapists and it was an interesting program, very successful. it also made us will realize that therapy had been born in universities because it wasn't an intellectual thing when you were dealing with people who hadn't been in universities. That is, we didn't want people who been in universities. We wanted people who only had a high school education because we wanted them to know only what we talked them and we didn't want them to know about psychology and all that, because we were teaching a particular form of therapy. But at any rate, there was one young man and that outfit, his name was Gerald and he was treating a family with the delinquent son, a father, a mother and a delinquent son with whom Gerald was working with him and I was behind the mirror. And I called him out and I said, "I'm supposed to be supervising you and I don't know what your doing." And he said, " just watch," and went back in the room. So I watched a while and after while I called him out and I said, "I've been watching you and I don't know what you're doing." and he said, "Well, I'm nudging the father." So I said, "What is nudging the father?" And he said, "Well, you just watch," and he went back in. And, uh, I watched him and I could see that he was paying particular attention to the father and when I talked to him about it later he said, "Well, what nudging is is when the father's, I want the father to have more authority over this boy because he's out of control and the mother can't handle him, so I want the father to have a higher status. So he said, "When father speaks up, I pay a lot of attention to him. The mother and child speak I don't pay too much attention to them." And watching that you could see the father just rise in the room. And that's what I mean by a laying on of hands, that you pass power to people and where that becomes important, if you pass power to the children or adolescents who are out of control, I think, uh, you're producing the difficulties that you're trying to solve. But if you think in coalitions you're more careful about that, I think. If you also think that way, you're more concerned about colleagues because you have to, uh, get together with your colleagues before you can do much with the family I think, otherwise you start to do something with family and a more powerful colleague will intervene and do something you would rather they didn't do, like take somebody out of the family or if it's a protective service problem or to medicate but you don't want them medicated. So, you have to work out an arrangement with your colleagues to begin with, often. And if you're thinking in terms of coalitions, your careful about that because you want everybody to be in agreement, really. 

00:37:40
Get Adults in Agreement with You 

00:37:40
JAY HALEY In fact, there's, uh, there's a good argument that adolescents who are serious problems will behave themselves if all the adults are in agreement about how to deal with them. That is, if you can get the two parents into agreement instead of conflict and if you can get them in agreement with you, the therapist, that helps. And if you can get them in agreement with you and whoever else is involved with the case, the Protective Service people or whoever it might be. And it, it sounds simple to just get the adults to agree on how to deal with this adolescent, but it's a very complicated process to get that to happen in many cases, uh, because the adults get their emotions involved, they form coalitions with the kids, they feel people don't appreciate this child and so on, and it's very difficult. But I think it's important, and one of the, uh, things you try to avoid, I think is having the family or the parents hand the problem over to you because you're not raising these kids. They're going to have to raise these kids. And I, what happens very often is the family gets into difficulties and the kid gets out of control by some misbehavior and the parents call upon the community to help and then from then on whenever there's trouble the parents call upon the community to help. 

00:39:05
Get the Family to Solve Their Own Problems 

00:39:05
JAY HALEY And part of the goal of a family therapist is to get the family to deal with this problem and to get the community out of it. Get the kid out of the residential program and back into the family and get the family not to call the cops next time but to solve this problem themselves, and so they contain their problems within the family. But at any rate, if you think of coalitions you, you think in threes. If you think in ones, you can't have a coalition, or in twos you can't have a coalition. So if you're thinking about the emotions and beliefs and perceptions of a person, it's very difficult to think about what coalitions are they in including the ones with you. If you think dyadically like this mother and child are really in a struggle, you don't think in terms of coalitions such as who is having, who is playing them off against each other. When you're thinking in threes, you notice things like that. So it's an interesting unit, I think, to choose is to think in threes. It's become the basic family therapy unit and that makes a large difference when you...I doesn't mean that you don't, you always interview the whole family, but if you, if you see an adolescent alone you're in the triangle of parents who are struggling with that adolescent and it isn't just you and the adolescent. The more, uh, successful you are with the adolescent often the more upset the parents become because it makes them realize they've failed and here you are succeeding, so that the success can be a problem with the young person has attached to you. And many families have rules that children shouldn't be attached outside the family very closely. You that when children start school often and, uh, I've seen families move because a kid got too fond of a teacher. There, there's loyalty issues that come up, uh, at the boundary of a family that I think have to be taken seriously. At any rate, if you think about the adults as a group you can think of ways to bring adults together in agreement about dealing with the kid, but also you can think about the peers of the, of the adolescent in dealing with them. By using them to help straighten out the young person, that is peer pressure can be used in a positive way as well as a negative. We had a, an interesting intervention that you might want to use. One of our supervisors, Judy Mountain developed it. She, when a family would come in...she's done this with them, parents come in with a, a young person, an adolescent who's on dope or something, on marijuana, some milder kind, and the parents want the kid off marijuana and the kid wants to get off marijuana, wants to clear pot, but he's struggling with this problem. 

00:41:55
Use Peer Pressure as a Resource 

00:41:55
JAY HALEY So what she would do is have the, uh, kid list all his friends, this is the list of the names of all his friends, and they list a lot of friends because they didn't have a problem having friends, and then the therapist gives the parents the task of sitting down with the kid that night at the telephone and have them call each friend and say he's giving up pot and he would appreciate the friend's help with this and he'll do it and he'll call 25 friends and say he's giving up pot. If after that he smokes pot, he feels like an idiot because he's got this whole group observing him and, uh, and not co-operating in helping him smoke pot because that's what, what he asked for. So there's ways to use peer pressure just as there are ways to use adult pressure with them. But normally, uh, you see a few errors. Like, I'm not sure if we know everything to do with adolescence but we know of the errors I think we can make. There are so many of them. 

00:42:55
Error 1.Join adolescent against parents 

00:42:55
JAY HALEY One of them, I think, is to join the adolescent against the parents. And that's a basic error of hierarchy. It's one which, uh, I realized in the 60s. In the 50s when we began to see families, we had the theory if we pressed it and we wanted everybody to express themselves, because then they would unrepressed indeed over the problem. So we had families expressed themselves and they everything. and we weren't thinking hierarchically, we were treating the family as a group of individuals, really all of them expressing themselves and we had a lot of self expressions. It was pretty lively. It didn't change much but it was exciting. But in the early 1960s, that I can remember a particular interview where I, I realized what was happening. Don Jackson was dealing with a 17-year-old girl diagnosed schizophrenic, a very bright young woman and, uh, as was her father. And, uh, the mother started to talk and the girl interrupted her and Jackson stopped the daughter and he said, "Let your mother speak." And that was evolutionary thing to do. it doesn't sound like it but I assure you, to quiet that adolescent and not let them speak you were a cat in those days because you were supposed to encourage self-expression remember. But if you're thinking organizationally and you're thinking of empowering the parents, you want to quiet the daughter and have the mother speak because you're trying to give mother some authority in the situation with an out-of-control daughter. but that was the exception and not everybody has been able to take it. there's still a tendency to let adolescents talk and one of the things they do is they confuse the situation and they say to the parents, by calling attention to themselves and taking off on emotional outbursts and then you forget what you were dealing with a few minutes before and changing the organization of the family. So what any rate, joining the adolescents against the parents is a mistake because you're giving power to someone who isn't ready for the power yet, uh, usually. and I think it's very hard not to do this if you're a residential program where you're working with kids 40 hours a week, you see the parents, if at all, you see them once a week. You get very fond of the kid. You never hear the parents side of it, really. The parents feel of resentment of parents when they come and therefore they tend to be withdrawn and then the, the therapist thinks, "Well, these parents are just withdrawn, not really appreciating this kid like I do." So that joining the kid is very difficult in that, in that kind of program. It's easier at home avoiding joining them. 

00:45:40
Error 2.Join parents against adolescent 

00:45:45
JAY HALEY but I think it's also an error to join the parents against the adolescent and only join them and saying, "By George, let's straighten this kid out." Because if you just join the parents and ignore the adolescent, they'll get you. The adolescent has power in that they can harm themselves and they can do all kinds of things. You have to list their cooperation. You can't just join parents and say, "Straighten this kid out." you have to see the kid alone. You have to persuade the adolescent that there's something in this for them. It's a part of, of the art of therapy to join parents and adolescents when they're in conflict. 

00:46:20
Error 3.Offer Premature Solutions 

00:46:25
JAY HALEY There's another error that you often get into and that is, uh, offering premature solutions. Really to, to rush in and offer a directive or an idea or something before you know what's happening is an error many people make, I think, when they get eager. 

00:46:40
Error 4.Fight trivial battles 

00:46:45
JAY HALEY I think it's also an error fight a trivial battle, to get into a whole battle over whether somebody should come in at 11:30 or 11:45. 

00:46:50
Error 5.Forget long-term goals 

00:46:55
JAY HALEY Because part of that is because you're doing another error, which is to forget the long-term goals of this. your goal is not to get a, a kid to conform to the family. your goal is to help the kid develop an independent life while living in the family and that the complex collaboration. So that when, whenever you're into a struggle you have to think about how do you want this kid to be five years from now, really...and where. 

00:47:20
Error 6. Confuse social control and therapy 

00:47:25
JAY HALEY another error, I think, is to confuse social control and therapy, because social control is too quiet trouble, too, to keep the community from being bothered by troublemakers. And social, therapy really isn't for that. therapy is to enrich people's lives, to increase the complexity of people's lives, not to so do them or limit their behavior. One of the things about that is to raise the question whose agent you are. Whose side are you on, in a way, because you're always on somebody side. one of the things that happens is if you go into a family in crisis, if you're a crisis therapist and you go in and there's a whole uproar in a family and you were choosing somebody to hospitalize, you could hospitalize just about anybody because they're all upset and they're all acting pretty bizarre. Your, the issue is that the father is usually working and supporting the family. The mother is usually working and supporting the family as well is taking care of the kids. They have a function that take them out of the family would be a big disruption, so if you're going to hospitalize somebody the most vulnerable person is the adolescent. They're the ones who have no purpose. They're not doing anything of any importance really as far as the structure of the situation is concerned. So the tendency is to take the adolescent out and put them in a place somewhere. Then the family settles down and the adolescent begins to behave appropriately to that place and then everybody feels that they made the right decision, they did the right diagnosis and this is it. but I think it's best to think of this as a situation that everybody gets involved them when you're into a decision like that. 

00:49:10
Error 7. Not to look for source of Power of Adolescent 

00:49:10
JAY HALEY One of the, uh, other errors is not to look where the adolescent draws power because often, uh, you'll see parents collapsing when an adolescent does something and, uh, one of the ways you think about it is to look to see who the adolescent is in coalition with, like a powerful grandmother for a divorced father or someone who doesn't necessarily live nearby is supporting the adolescent to go against the parents, and that's their source of power to some extent. You know, for those of you who haven't made a transition to thinking about families, there was an interesting, an interesting set of ideas I think that the individual has been explored for 2000 years and we've said about everything you can say about the individual. The family is only about 30 years old as a source of exclamation and to provide new ideas for motivation that we haven't had before. I mean, let me give you an example. You can observe a, a mother say to her child, "Would you mind if I tell you what to do?" And you have to explain why would she ask the ch-, if she's in charge why is she asking the child can she be in charge? and if you think individually, you think maybe there's something wrong with her thinking, it's a little disordered in the situation, and you would focus on her. if you think those it as a dyadic thing, you would think well maybe this child is so smart he outsmarts her and therefore they have a relationship in which the child is dominant because of that. You'd make that explanation. If you think in triangles, you'll look to see who's and coalition with the child against her and you may find that there is a father involved in joining the child against the mother or a grandmother involved so that the, she doesn't really have the power. she has to ask the kids permission because the kid is in coalition with somebody they give the kid the power that she doesn't have. If you think that way, that's a whole new explanation of why a mother behaves the way she does in her family and it's all the same mother and you have a choice of how you're going to explain her behavior or whether, whichever explanation you make has a tremendous influence on the parenting. so we have to look for where they come, I mean John Jackson used to say parents control shelter. They control who. They control clothes. If they don't use their power then there is some reason why they don't. Either they're divided themselves or the kid has drawn power from someone else. 

00:52:00
Error 8. Not assuming parents have been blamed in the past 

00:52:05
JAY HALEY There's another error, I think, and that is, uh, not assuming that parents have been blamed when they come to you. If you get resistant parents who don't cooperate or parents who don't want to command, I think in most cases it's because some previous therapist has blamed them for the kids problems and they see no point incoming in to get blamed again. Why go through that? And therefore they, uh, they just avoid coming in and they, they dumped the kid on you and I think if parents do that you have to think about how to persuade them it's gonna be different this time than I was last time. Because there is also a history of parents being blamed in the family therapy field that will get started from joining young people against parents and I think we slowly moved to the reverse, really of joining parents against young people. I think it's because as we got older that seemed more reasonable. I'm not sure. But it's also been a concern for hierarchy. 

00:53:05
Error 9. Assume families know how to behave in therapy 

00:53:10
JAY HALEY there's another, uh, error that I think people make and that is to assume that families know what you want from them or individuals for that matter, that, that they know what therapy is and how to behave there. And I think often they don't if they come in for the first time, they don't know what they should do their. if you do a family interview you often have to explain, "I'd like everybody to talk, to take a turn and express yourselves. Say what the problem is and what your ideas are and so on." that is, some of them, and thinking therapy is when you come in and get emotional and all that and they, they get all upset over something that is a misunderstanding. if they understand that you're not really interested in getting of them all upset, that you're interested in clarifying the issues and resolve these problems, then, uh, they behave that way. So, I think you can be in error by assuming they know what you want. They don't necessarily know what you want. Part of the opening of therapy is to, to work that out. 

00:54:10
Empowering Parents 

00:54:10
JAY HALEY What I'm really emphasizing is the idea of empowering parents. There is a curious phenomenon which some people find hard to believe, that if you get parents to pull together and draw a generation line or an executive line in relation to a young person, the young person goes normal. They change a lot of difficult, defiant, crazy behavior. They just drop it. The problem is how to get parents to do that, how to get parents to take charge. If you tell them how to behave in taking charge, they're not in charge. They're just doing what you say, which is not taking charge themselves. So the art of the business is to get them to spontaneously take charge. And that takes some skill sometimes. But I think one of the important things is the first interview, which if it goes well that's often the only interview if you're a problem-focused therapy. that is, we do with therapy where they come in with a problem, we get them over it, they go about their business. we don't attempt then to change all their family relationships or work out all the difficulties. If they're having other difficulties, they come back and they deal with that one. It's, uh, it's not a therapy where we feel were going to remove all the problems in the family. I think families often improve more after therapy than they do during it, so that the, uh, the termination which is likely to balloon to them has a very positive effects very often. At any rate, I think therapy is interview technique essentially. What else is there? You sit down with people and you talk to them, and out of that comes a change.
