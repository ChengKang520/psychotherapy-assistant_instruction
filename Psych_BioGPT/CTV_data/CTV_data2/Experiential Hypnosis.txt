Stephen Lankton, LCSW, DAHB 

00:00:30
STEPHEN LANKTON I want to do demonstration. I've already selected a subject and umm… I want to say here introductory remarks here 

00:00:40
[sil.] 

00:00:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Umm… Before we uh… before we came right, there is some childhood incidences sort of been and early adulthood incidences that have been uh… memorable for Fabian (ph.) and I, we discussed how we could handle these, the traumas, sort of the post traumatic stress aspects uh… of some of these incidences while retaining a reasonable amount of confidentiality in an uncontrolled environment like this is and so I umm… wrote down a few of the things she told me and you'll hear them as we go. Umm… as I was thinking about who to select through general and how to go about this? Suddenly, it looked like a perfect storm. We've got a bunch of therapists here who can benefit from a demo about PTSD and trauma recovery. We've got a room full of Paris and St. Bernadino (ph.) and refugees all over the world from Syria and problems in Ukraine, problems with the VA. There is not any of you who aren't close enough to some of these stuff that some ideas about how to handle trauma but it would be a great idea. I think and uh… so kind of comes together wonderfully if we do that. The good news is that's what we're gonna do. The bad news is, you don't have privy to some of the uh… uh… details of, of Fabian's past and uh… that's just sort as gonna be as could trade up I think. So with that in mind, Fabian, would you like to add anything, that anything you'd like to say to the group about why you are here, what you would like to do and you can say nothing, I mean. She's not really, just like feel the space. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN No, I think uh… it would be greatly useful for me if umm… I can learn and I think I learn that more and more and at times, I can go sometimes in very uh… dark places where I, I feel uh… too young. I, I not the age, I should be and when I go into those dark places, I would like to remember the strength uh… the livelihood, the skills, I have would be really, it would really… 

00:03:15
STEPHEN LANKTON That sounds like a great idea. 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN A good plan. 

00:03:20
STEPHEN LANKTON I know, some of the dark places. I brought something that I thought about. I have a collection of these things, a few of them. You know, I was wondering, if you've ever seen them. Those of you who can't see it, it's about the size of a walnut, looks kind of like a walnut. There it is. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN It's the poop of an animal, you know, poop. 

00:03:45
[sil.] 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN No, what is it? 

00:03:50
STEPHEN LANKTON A poop of a what? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Of an animal? 

00:03:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh, an animal. Now that you've named the animal. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN No, it's, it's, it's a ball. 

00:04:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Yes, well, it's a concretion of some kind that is 82 to 87 million years old and it comes from uh… the, if you pronounce it, Niobrara(ph) uh… shell formation that goes through several parts of the North Western, Colorado Wyoming and Kansas and those are only found in Kansas. Nobody knows they are made. You notice it. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN I don't know, tell me. 

00:04:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. I actually only dropped one. I had already heard what it's made, well it's filled good but as for viewers out there. It's filled with sand. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN Oh, wow. 

00:04:40
STEPHEN LANKTON So in some miraculous way uh… this sand got surrounded by pyrite and palladium and nobody knows how that occurred exactly. They are called buggi (ph.) balls or… 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Can I hold it for a while? 

00:04:55
STEPHEN LANKTON You may. You can hold it. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Maybe I can have the power of the hoogi (ph.) ball. 

00:05:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Sure. It's a good idea. I know, I uh… have recently put together some shadow boxes. Uh… I have got souvenirs from really little souvenirs from a lot of countries like in Japan there is some little paper things and we put them in a drawer or you put them on a shelf and they collect dust. And it dawned on me the other day that I could get the thing called the shadow box, shadow boxes are like the three dimensional photo frame and like, I have these cool little trinkets, some of them are sacred being some of them are just talismans to sell to uh, visitors. And I put all the shadow boxes and put them in different places in different rooms of the house, even put a little light over one of them and uh… so when I was thinking about these broken one which I've kept in this, this drawer, I was thinking I should get a shadow box for my little booty balls. I don't think, I will but, but the broken one needs care, you know. So uh… push arms for just a second and get comfortable. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN I'll just take a little bit of water. 

00:06:15
STEPHEN LANKTON You know, first of all you need hypnosis, so rather than be clever about it. I'll just ask you to close your eyes and start recognizing the comfort of breathing through your nose and whatever speed you're doing right now. Sooner or later, you have an option to balance the breathing in and out of both nostrils and I understand from pranayama yoga that once you accomplish that awareness it sort of frees your head of thoughts, it's a little hard to have chatter at the same time that you balance your breathing in that way. I don't know your conscious mind is preoccupied with a number of things. While your unconscious probably has a much keener focus on what it is that, what kind of grip, than what it is that would be useful for you to change. Your unconscious maybe in tune with a number of things that are similar in a lot of ways while your conscious mind thinks about so many different possibilities. 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
STEPHEN LANKTON But you can just abuse your mind of worry and focus on your breathing so that kind of clears away. And while your conscious mind is no doubt aware that you just had a little fear or pleasure, you couldn't just say how your unconscious help you create it. Before we go too far, I'd like to ask you to tell me the age of a time when you felt as empowered as you can remember feeling in the past. Maybe it was for graduation, maybe it was when you defended your dissertation or got married or I don't know when it was. But think for a minute while you relax or feeling pleasant like that. You know, just tell me the age and tell me the age of that younger Fabian. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN One age or several? 

00:08:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Just one. The best one you can think of. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN 27. 

00:08:55
STEPHEN LANKTON 27. And do you suppose that by 59 you would have put all these behind you? So let's pick a 59 year old Fabian as well and before we go too far, picture what 59 year old Fabian is gonna look like. Put her in front of you and stand up, turn around. Look at your face and color of her hair and length of her hair, what she is wearing in those days. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And then keep that in mind, we'll come back to her in a minute. And a 27 year old Fabian, I think, you can make a picture of her as well, no doubt. Probably, you already did that. Yeah, so put her aside for a second. We're gonna come back to that. So your unconscious mind maybe a little bit interested in what your unconscious could possibly do with these two visions. Great, self realize that you're sitting there comfortably anticipating increasingly grounded, waiting. Maybe waiting to be increasingly grounded while you're comfortably sitting there. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Just waiting or maybe you're comfortably waiting while you're sitting there grounded. 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Your fingers are touching and you can just begin to go deeper into relaxation. Your arms are on two sides comfortably and get deeper with each count. Your head sort of tilted to the side. 

00:10:55
[sil.] 

00:11:00
STEPHEN LANKTON 10, 9, a little bit deeper. And it may not really be necessary for you to even go any deeper, and 8, 7 still getting more relaxed and deeper. Because you're already have the capability of achieving all kinds of things, it's just a matter of whether your conscious mind can, can still go a little deeper, seven, six, five, recognize the value of your unconscious and it store, talents, and memories and ideas, conclusions. All of the things that, four, still a little bit deeper, three, and two, you begin to find, it got you through all of the circumstances in life and brought you to this chair, this day sitting there and tilted arms, hands relaxed, feet on the floor and three, now go a little bit deeper, two and as far as deep you can go for right now, one. 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:25
STEPHEN LANKTON You can go deeper if you want. But first I wonder if you ever met anybody like the little boy I knew who lived in a house with the mother that was so self-absorbed and self-centered and selfish. She caused him a little bit of doubt and his father was so unpredictable and mean sometimes that he began to watch things in the house, watch things in the driveway and when father started get close and come home, he went through the house and made sure that every little thing was in order. Driving himself all the time by his fear of what he hears his father saying. The criticism. So he was so excited in therapy when I pointed out to him that he seems to motivate himself with criticism because that's how he learnt motivate himself at home to prevent bad things from happening. And he didn't need to do that anymore. He realized that, he really wasn't so much part of the house. When he realized family was a part of the world, he decided, he was kind of part of the world. But how do you stop that internal criticisms or self-doubts. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
STEPHEN LANKTON As you're sitting there perfectly comfortable safe, imagine a 59 year old Fabian in out front and when you see her just nod your head to me as a signal. 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Now, ask her to do a very weird thing. Ask her to imagine that I'm in front of her as the 27 year old Fabian and you don't need to see the 27 year old Fabian. You just need to see that the 59 year old, nods her head to you that she can see the 27 year old and then nod your head to me when she nods your head to you. Now I'd like you to ask something of the 59 year old to ask the 27 year old that she would be willing to participate in a review of several events that have occurred in her past and you don't have to see the events, you don't have to see the 27 year old. You just need to the 59 year old communicating to you about what she's learnt when she sees a head from the 27 year old that she's ready to proceed. And just nod your head to me when you see the 59 year old nod her head to you. Now so tell, the 59 year old to tell the 27 year old really thank you for participating in this way and tell her you have been asked for some things to do through the 59 year old that I'm gonna suggest to you. Ask her, you remember, ask the 27 year old to review the events and words and pictures only of the time that Fabian went to the movies for the very first time and was left alone. And when she's reviewed it completely from beginning to end to nod her head to the 59 year old so the 59 year old can nod her head to you, and then you can let me know, by nodding your head that she's completed her review of that. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Tell them thanks and ask her again to review, ask the 59 year old to ask the 27 year old again to review a new thing, this time umm… when it dawned on the 27 year old that the major scene of the family was that there was no conversation and to review those times of no conversation, what that felt like in words and pictures only and when she's accomplished that, the 27 year old is to nod her head to the 59 year old who can nod her head to you to let you know that the review is completed. Words and pictures only. And so you can see and hear the pain but not feel it. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:15
STEPHEN LANKTON And ask her to proceed if they don't need a break to have the 59 year old to ask the 27 year old to review in words and pictures only the incidents surrounding her first menstruation. And take as long as she needs with the 27 year old to nod her head to the 59 year old, to nod her head to you and let me know. As you can see and hear this in words and pictures only. You might have the feeling. And in each of these situations the younger Fabian and they, they need something. We'll get into that in a minute. And then have the 59 year old ask the 27 year old that she would review in words and pictures only the several incidents of the other person's attempted suicide. 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
STEPHEN LANKTON You don't have to see that at all, you don't have to see the 27 year old, you can just focus on the 59 year old waiting for a head nod that the 27 year old has completed reviewing those several attempted suicides. And then nod her head to you, when it's all over, that the 27 year old has reviewed all of those incidences in words and pictures only. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:40
STEPHEN LANKTON So when the 27 year old is satisfied that you can review all these things in words and pictures only, this context to nod her head to the 59 year old and then to you. And then you to me. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:10
STEPHEN LANKTON And then tell the things ask them to take a little vacation, but it can only last for a few seconds because we have to move forward. But it can seem like a whole year to them. And then ask the 59 year old to ask the 27 year old to review the incident and Fabian have broken already. And how the incidents surround that unfolded because she finally got to the hospital and back. In words and pictures only and when the 27 year old has done that and nod her head to the 59 year old to nod her head to you, that's been cleared. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:20
STEPHEN LANKTON And then ask the 59 year old to ask the 27 year old to watch a rather older Fabian who is in that first family therapy session, watch how that way in words and pictures only, the knowledge and the understanding and then reason for the choices made but not the bad feelings as you watch it in words and pictures only. Kind of into nod her head to the 59 year old when she's completed that for the 59 year old to nod her head to you and you to me. 

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Great. And make sure you're still feeling really, really comfortable. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:40
STEPHEN LANKTON We're unconsciously working very hard. And you can take a year of vacation right now and rest for a couple of moments, that's right and now ask the 59 year old, she won't please continue and ask the 57 year old to continue, to review that incident involved the dot on the wall. In words and pictures only. And thus she can retain the knowledge and the understanding and the learning that came from that, but not the feeling and nod her head with the 59 year old to nod her head to you. And you to me. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:24:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Watch this doing that to your unconscious mind can be doing a lot of resourceful things to strengthen your own resolve. Thinking about souvenirs you've collected. And now ask the 59 year old to ask the 57 year old to ask, now your Fabian to review to be part of the review of all of the several times when clothing was carelessly purchased and that was forgiven. Of course that made younger Fabian feel bad. So how the 27 year old be able to review that in words and pictures only, that type of feelings. But retain the knowledge and the understanding, retain the learnings that she got. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:25:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Your unconscious mind can be doing something else, something small, matter or something. Request for the, good opportunity with you and I are here we gather for the 59 year old to ask the 57 year old to review the time that the broken hip occurred when Fabian had the broken hip. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:40
STEPHEN LANKTON And if you were to have your unconscious think about it in the future and look back on, what would the 59 year old just looking at the 27 year old watching it. You might not be able to remember much about it except that it happened but it contained the understandings and the learnings that helped make you who you are. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:10
STEPHEN LANKTON All the times you have thought about the earthquake of January 14, 1994. I don't want you to think about that. I want you to ask the 59 year old to ask the 57 year old to watch it out in front of her retaining the learnings and the understandings but leaving the feeling there. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And when you're done with that, there is just so many other times that are unmentioned where there was moments of self-doubt. 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Moments of self-criticism. I don't even know what where but ask the 59 year old to ask the 57 year old to review a few of those key former moments of self-doubt. Initially, you can have her carry that out to the end because I'm pretty sure that if the conclusion of everything about which she had self-doubt, it came out wonderfully. There was never a time younger Fabian had self-doubt and a comet hit the earth. There was never a time when she had self-doubt about offering something that it didn't get published and reviewed with outstanding applause. There was never a time she had self-doubt about making a presentation. And it turns out that she didn't get invited back but maybe I'm saying too much. Let the 59 year old watch the 27 year old, watch those things while you sit there and try to figure out where it was you put the comfort that you had a minute ago. And amplify it and let it spread on your bloodstream, breathing into your heart. Enjoy the breathing, enjoy your heart. Your unconscious can either feel the joy of your heart but your conscious mind, pay a little bit of attention to the joy of your breathing while you watch the 59 year old. Well your unconscious can feel the joy of breathing while your conscious mind, a little bit feels the joy of your heart and the leftover consciousness watches for the head nod from the 59 year old, reviewing the 27 year old, thinking about those things that happened in words and pictures only that there was self-doubt. Now it may be a million of those so only pick a few hundred thousands so we can eventually just pick the bigger ones. If you pick enough ones, you could pick just three or four. Then you have a couple of million will be, nothing compared to that. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And when that is over, I'm going to ask you to do something I said, we'd talk about in a minute. 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:29:55
STEPHEN LANKTON We'll talk about it in a minute. You know, how 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Sometimes people forget until they are alone in a beautiful field with grass and flowers. Beautiful forest maybe. It's a little dewy in the morning and all of a sudden, the sun comes up over the horizon and its light is indescribable, wonderful. Only the best photographer seem to capture it on film. The sun rises in the sky, we forget something. We forget that the sun gives something to all of those trees and flowers and grains and we also maybe forget that the grains and the trees and the flowers give something back. And what they give back may not reach the sunlight 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:00
STEPHEN LANKTON But it's a give back and just the same. When people think about themselves as younger, they may not realize that they are often thinking about a resource that they had or a resource that they wished they had, had. So they need to go back just a little prior to that memory and pick up that resource. I worked with a woman one time in Philadelphia who, with whom we did the same exercise. She had read, read, read, read that story to tell. 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Because it's nothing like your story. 

00:31:50
[sil.] 

00:31:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Her situation concerned a father who used to inject heroin and have, his friends come over to have sex with her and she had repressed all of it. One day it came out during a session with her husband and she came to see me individually to help do something that would put it to rest and after she did, which was a very brave thing, interesting session that I caught on tape fortunately umm… I asked her what the little girl had needed, that the little girl, when it all started. And she said the little girl needed to know what she knows now as an adult. She was in a count knowledge and she was even a judge for accounting programs and whatever that means. So she really accomplished, really felt confident. She really made it by herself. And that's what that little girl needed to know, to know that some day she'd grow up and have all that for her own, to call her own. She'd have hope and confidence and I said what's the little girl have that you need? Well, in her case, it was a feeling of joy and even sexuality. And I don't know what little Fabian has that you might need. Maybe it's confidence, maybe it's trust, maybe it's some hope, maybe it's carefreeness, maybe it's an ease to turn on playfulness, the joyfulness. Maybe it's the sense of warmth, maybe it's companionship, hope, love, I don't know. But if there is anything that little has that you need ask the 59 year old to ask the 27 year old to ask that little Fabian and what she would need from you in order to share it and tell her what you've got that you could provide to her. In a lifetime of independently solving problems and being strong, succeeding and having good judgment even wisdom and clinical acumen and all kinds of things of reading people a little bit you have that she might want to have as a little girl. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And ask the 27 year old to tell the 59 year old to tell you that if that little girl is willing to trade. She wouldn't give it up. It would just be that whatever you want that feeling that she's got or that resource that she's got, you would transmit down to that part of yourself. It's a grown up resource that you have and whenever she needed that grown up resource that you have, she would flood you with those feelings or thoughts or experiences that she has to offer you back. You can make a trade. And if you've made the trade or considered making the trade, make the trade now and if it works for both of you, have 27 year old let the 59 year old know with a head nod that you can nod your head too to you. And then test it one more time. And test it without the intermediaries, just you straight to the younger Fabian, that's real quick. From your unconscious to conscious mind or from your conscious mind down to your unconscious, the trade is made. And I was just thinking, you know, that little boy that I saw. We came upon this great idea when he was thinking about things in his past that were kind of like mental movies. He got, he could like a snapshot to save himself a lot of neural activity if you just had a little photograph in his mind, a little video even of the symbolically represented that incident. So I ask him to go through review all of those little movies that he'd seen in my office and make little snapshots of each one that symbolically represented it. So tiny that they didn't drive emotion. They just reminded from the picture of the learnings and understandings that it helped shape who he was and made him who he was now. And where he had a whole bunch of them, all scattered around the desktop of his mind. He wondered what he could do with all of them. And I wondered too and then he said something that caught my mind later on. He said, he could make a little shadow box out of all those little pictures and so mentally he began constructing the shadow box putting with each picture and moving some around. And finally when he close the door of it and he could always open the door and put another one in. All close, how symbolic that they are all trapped inside this wooden frame and glass front. They can't get to me anymore but I can still see them and you remember who I was what shaped me, what decisions I came to make. Now know if you hung the shell box on the wall, now this house like I have hung mine. But have it been for that, and I would have never thought of making a shadow boxes. And they are shadow boxes from several countries around the world, the ones with the most interesting exotic souvenirs anyway that are small. And it reminds a person of being a citizen of the world. Just like it reminded him that he wasn't a citizen of that family, he was a citizen of the world. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Let that sink in… 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Anyway, you looked at the shadow box and you didn't belong to that family. It was real clear and how it all came together but you weren't part of that. And when you looked at that, you knew, it was different values and he knew it was different compassion, it was different wisdom. And he knew. He wasn't alone, even though he was all alone there. Because it made him feel like just part of the world. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And that's how he came to stop all that type of criticism. And self-doubt. So if I tell you their story, and you follow, I wanted to ask you, if you know what happens when a Gucci ball breaks. It breaks in half, it's filled with sand but nothing happens. It stays stable. You just have to treat it with a little care. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:10
STEPHEN LANKTON You've been waiting and sitting there comfortable sometimes, feeling grounded or comfortably grounded while you were sitting there relaxed, relaxed by being grounded while you were sitting there waiting. And sooner or later, they gonna just win. You'll probably take some of these learnings, refine them and change them and apply them to yourself. I don't really know if I can help you but I can help you, help yourself because you've helped yourself for so long. And I know when Erickson will tell a story that was extremely ambiguous, it would stay with me for years and years. And so even well, where he was only a few things that were really ambiguous, how long they can stay with you for years and how you can use that. Whispering connection back to your unconscious, to further help yourself again and again, the next few days and weeks and years to come. When you come back to the room, you need to come back to the room fully with all of your eye, hand coordination and mental acuity. If there is anything unfinished, you can put it aside and remember that you'll help yourself with it later and of course, by no mean is this a first complete therapy. It's just a demonstration that I know you use to your work completely eventually. Unless, you did it already, I don't know. Two, three, four, and sooner or later you'll want to open your eyes, five, six, come back to the room and make sure you're fully out of trance, seven, eight, nine and ten. How are you? 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Good. Thank you. 

00:42:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Do you know how long we've been sitting and doing this? 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN 20 minutes. 

00:42:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Uh… no, about 42 minutes. So that means, you have half amnesia. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN I don't make, it could have been a lifetime. 

00:42:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN It could have been a lifetime. 

00:43:00
STEPHEN LANKTON And you only have remind you and remember some of it. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:43:05
STEPHEN LANKTON That's a colloquialism. So uh… we have time left in the demonstration uh… a few minutes, do you think we should uh… ask the, break the third wall here and ask the audience to… 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:20
STEPHEN LANKTON They want to ask anything. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:43:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Okay, that's, I got your is not all over my hand. 

00:43:30
[sil.] 

00:43:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, before I die of something that I've contracted, do we have any questions on this? Yes sir. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN I felt that was great, (inaudible ). 

00:43:50
STEPHEN LANKTON I don't know, I said it was okay to ruin anything. Play the tape back. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Yes. Yeah, a couple of things. Umm… most of the time, Fabian had some what uh… to have a dry face is some of the smile. But we kept doing it so long and so as I was reminding her of so many things that roll at one point that she started to have tears a little bit and so I asked her to uh… undo that and back up a little bit as you may have noticed. It wasn't a big catastrophe, worse you would have cried. I just thought it was a good opportunity to uh… illustrate so a little bit of a recovery when you have overwhelmed the client too much to disassociate from. And the reason for the multiple disassociation is because each of those represents some kind of resources. Umm… it's not gonna mess it up for me to say this which is one of those things like the woman said in the matrix when she said, this is really gonna fry your bacon or whatever she's in. When you find out that, what was it? Toast or broke or the radio or whatever but she was just gonna, gonna mess it up when I say it out loud even though she's gonna know it and it's, that was gonna blow your mind when she realizes that one day uh… the idea of taking a 59 year old image and putting it there uh… oh before I hold that. So you don't have to use someone from the future in the middle. You can use two past people. Uh… the one the published version of this in the uh… collective paper that Steve lengthen. And uh… I, I use the case of a woman who had been in the famous movie of train disaster incident which may not be famous to you all unless you're in south. But, you know, in Mobile, Alabama, an Amtrak train went across the bridge of the boat that hit the pillar and uh… damages so much they didn't know when the train crashed and fell into the water. A totally submerge car and the war was halfway submerged and then the rest of the train and uh… my client was uh… she's on the cover of People magazine at one point for this, you may be familiar with this incident. Uh… she was in a half submerged train and got out and uh… it was pretty harrowing because her husband was had quadruple bypass or something a couple of months before and she was reading about him. When you hit the water, you could have gone through a bunch of fuel oil and you pop back up you got smoke from the fuel oil on your face and that was burning, this little window they could swim in and she was holding her husband and then came to a sand barn and stood on it. She was so relieved until she found out it was the top of the submerged train and thought, oh my God I'm standing on a tomb of these people who are drowning right below my feet. So she was really freaked out by that, that part specially. And uh… we give this very thing and I just publish that uh… as a, in, in reference to the work their. With her, you know, train disaster happened ten days before. So I'm not gonna find two incidents of memories of her being strung between the mobile train disaster and her ten days later, right. And so you may have a situation like that. We have to pull younger parts of, of, of her name is Carol. Younger parts of Carol from prior to that or you could pull the older part that hasn't been alive yet. Most times, you're just be able to pick two between, you know, I was raped when I was 16 and now I'm 40 and I depict two times in between. Uh… those represent visually every time she has to get ahead now from one of those people that represents the resources and when it's a person from the future, it's a real interesting little trick and now we're back to the part, you hold that thought, that, that future person that you're, you picked as a person who's over it, you are tapping yourself into a position that you're gonna be over it in a really big way, over and over and over again. She's pre-supposed that she's on the other side of this. Because the person which she picked was represented yet and the building of a pre-supposition like this is huge. This is the only way you build a pre-supposition on the tools of attention that I have in a native image and that's another way of building a pre-supposition. But building pre-supposition is, not the easy way, when one is sitting in front of me and we're talking about back pain I had and he was talking about the different ways, I can get rid of the back pain as in trance, so, you know, it's one of those slow talks. Talk really slow, you know trance. Now you could think about a time in the past when you didn't had back pain. And I thought, I've done all that. It doesn't work. Simply said, much to my surprise. Going into the future and think about a time in the future when you're not going to have that pain anymore. And, crap, I hadn't thought of that. In fact, I'm not having any back pain right at the moment and that's what I learnt about pre-supposition being created in the trance. So uh… that's the reason for the selection and the reason for the selection of one from the future and some of you who don't have to have them in between the person and the incident, it can be before the incident, half and half etc. Okay next answering won't be so long. Yeah. 

00:49:50
[sil.] 

00:50:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Umm… yeah a good question. I think, I might have done fewer but this ongoing aspect also gives you time to then to go to over other you know, mental rehearsals of how I'm gonna act now around uh… the people I visualize in the past, you know, how am I gonna now act when I go umm… I had a 16 year old, I had a 20 year old who was raped when she was 16, 22 year old raped when she was 16. And uh… by a family member, she had kept back to her. So our hypnosis was also used to rehearse in the next few sessions you know, used to rehearse uh… how she's gonna tell her mother who she feared telling uh… and for she imagines, she figured stepfather first and that was perfect and then through him back together and that went perfect. But that's, so that became another session while the disassociation was one session, figuring out how we are gonna deal with the rest of the family members, we come to the next, one of the next sessions and other things developed as the first thing, in her case uh… and she got more in touch with him and willing to share her feelings, other things happened that we got to talk about. She realized, I won't say more but anyway, because I said, so because I said, I assure you. Next question, any more questions? We have a couple of more minutes, so if you'd like. Yeah. Is there any questions for Fabian that, we can ask you? It's okay? 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:35
STEPHEN LANKTON Sure a 59 and you had a 27. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN 27 and sometimes you said 57. 

00:51:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh, I don't know. Honestly. It might have been bad acoustics, yeah. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:51:48
STEPHEN LANKTON A little louder. 

00:51:50
[sil.] 

00:52:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Of the age. Umm… be perfectly frank, I planned to doing that before the trance started. And so that now we are already in trance, I didn't want to get into some big dialogue about anything and so I just thought well 59 might be a perfectly good age, so I asked and she agreed. How do you think about that when this represent? 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN You know what, it's interesting because I had a struggle as you said 59, I could imagine myself at 59 and then I, I saw, no, I want to get over it much faster. So I imagine myself uh… 50 or 49 and a half and I kind of zip to uh…, I erased your, your suggestion. 

00:52:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, now that's the other thing to keep in mind that client will modify what you say, so it works for them. So every time I said, 59, she thinks 49 and a half which is perfect. Just the, you know word to label to, hook to your experience, so you can use it. It's not the truth. Yeah. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:53:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, I didn't want to relieve the theories. I just wanted you to relieve the part that, you know, that you take away from that and still feel comfortable. So, you know, you think about umm… a death of a loved one, it's in the past for example. For a while, you are grieving and when you think about it, you cry and that comes up and bites you and now and then few years later but at some point, it gets to where you can think about that person and think about all kinds of funny adventures. And you are just having the, the pictures and the things you said but you're not having the bad feelings associated with it even the you know, the hospital. So that's where it comes after where it finally gets reach on to things to manageable sizes is that you keep the learning in words and pictures uh… and maybe a feeling of some kind like I did that. Good for me feeling. But not the actual feeling driven from the memory. Yeah. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:54:21
STEPHEN LANKTON Can you take the mic, I can't hear you. He has a soft voice. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN Did you have a, the experience of a lot of cognitive processing or was it, was it sort of automatic while going through the, the process, it was a… 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Neither. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Neither. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN It was, like I said, I, I felt like I was living many lives. It was very uh… vivid I guess, it depends on how used one is to trance. But It's a pretty common place for me to go to. I believe was umm… in and out of those scenes. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, so now a lot of thinking necessarily but just kind of flowing in and out of the experiences? 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN It was, it was really like a full experience for the senses. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN You're welcome. 

00:55:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, we have time for one more question. Any? 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Does the separation, separating of the feeling uh… working with the UTSD uh… is that a technique for (inaudible ). 

00:55:50
[sil.] 

00:55:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, this is a great question. Let me repeat it, so everyone heard it. Is uh… doing what we did here without the feelings or way to resolve the PTSD umm… is that the whole of the question? Umm… and the answer is absolutely yes because the, the things we are trying to solve remember in anything, a cure is having the ability to get the resources you need in the context in which you need them. So if it's walking down a street and not thinking that I'm, I'm on the streets of Beirut, I need to be able to get the resources to keep me in reality orientation here and there and somehow the memory of Beirut is blocking that. I can't get the resources that I have in that context. So if I can get those to not be glued into me this early, I so have, no, I wasn't in Beirut but I can, it's not driving my thought process anymore. I'm separated from it and disassociated from it. So I can now, I'm free to get the resources, I do need. So in further situations like I was answering the questions here before was just perfect with that, the next therapy session might be how would Fabian uh… approach her mother and father in future situations that pertain to, you know, I don't know, holiday dinners or whatever happens to be in a family unit and help her get those and make sure, she can get to those resources because for years, if it's been really bad, she thinks about, you know, a person will think about the traumatic incidents, you know, I think about my, my, my uncle beating me with a baseball bat and I can't think how I'm gonna talk to him about Christmas because when I think about my uncle, I think about getting beaten by a baseball bat and now that's been disassociated way. So that's step one. That's the crucial step for their recovery and, and a person may then be on their own to think about their own, going the way they want to. But the future therapy session can be actually making sure they can get the resources, they do want in the event, they have some poorly developed resources. If they got really with the resources like Fabian, then I don't have to do that. She knows how to pull up any resources she wants. Yeah. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN Did you give her a host (inaudible ) or it was a just unconscious mind that has been working on that… 

00:58:20
[sil.] 

00:58:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Umm… yeah. Yeah. 

00:58:30
[sil.] 

00:58:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, yeah, it's good to uh… know the ending before the story has been told. Okay guys so it's time that we say goodbye. Thank you very much. Thank you for your assistance. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN Thank you, thank you too.
