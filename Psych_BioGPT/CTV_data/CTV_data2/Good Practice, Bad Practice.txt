MIKE SIMMONS Hello my name is Mike Simmons, the work you are going to see in this program centers around two unscripted role plays in which we see a manager holding a meeting with one of her key workers. In one of these role plays, she uses what it generally called counseling skills, though they might equally well be called communication skills. In the other, she doesn't. In fact it’s hard to put a label on what she does do, other than to say it’s bad practice. You’ll get a chance to look at the sessions and see what you think of them. You’ll then see them again, and I will tell you what I think of them, and you can compare your notes with what I say. The likelihood is that you will notice something’s that I will miss, but hopefully, I will pick up on most of what's going on. It’s perhaps worth mentioning, that however good a piece of work is, it’s never going to be perfect or nor should we expect it to be, but by identifying everything that's going wrong in a session, we simply more able to learn, but before we start lets think about the function of the meeting. The key worker has asked for some time with his line manager, and this is it. The manager doesn't know what to expect. The worker does know what he wants to talk about. He has his own agenda. If the manager is going to learn what that agenda is, she will need to listen to him and to give him the flow. The extent to which she does this is the subject of this program. If she doesn't really listen to him, it’s unlikely that there will be a very satisfactory outcome. So, you will see both sessions without comment first, and I would encourage you to make notes while this happens. You will notice a time code on the screen, and you might find it worth jotting down the time code against the notes you make. It will help you to identify the points being made later on. You will then see the sessions again, but with my commentary, which will explain what I see going on. You will be able to compare your notes with my comments. So let's see those two sessions. 

00:02:40
Bad Practice 

00:02:45
MARY Okay then Peter, you… you called me to, and I said, I could… you know I can give you 10 minutes to um… you had the problem with some of the workers or something. So perhaps you could tell me. 

00:02:55
PETER I am… I’m just totally pissed off now. I’d enough. 

00:03:00
MARY Oh! 

00:03:00
PETER What's happened is um… we got to implement all that… that the rationalization program for the resources, and you know… 

00:03:10
MARY Yeah it’s all over the county isn't it? 

00:03:15
PETER …and you know these cutbacks acquaint severe, and I have got all these part-time staff, really threatening to walkout, that’s right an industrial action, you know we had to implement the… the pay cut you know they've regular on three hours, and now we’ve reduced that down and… 

00:03:30
MARY Yeah, they haven't actually had their rates of pay reduced, hopefully they have just… they have had their allowance reduced and may not the same for all the youth workers all over the county. 

00:03:40
PETER Yeah, but they have gone from, you know the 3 hours session to two and a half, and they have lost too their preparation time, and they… they just are really-really angry, they just feel that we are not looking after them, I mean, I‘m… I am in charge I know, and I have got to implement these cuts, but they are just so… so angry, that I’ve had enough, and I mean you are telling us to sort of being work out our budgets properly and I just think this is a impossible responsibility, and… 

00:04:15
MARY Yeah well I’m sorry it has given you grief you know, and I don't wanted to, you know I mean I obviously I do um… it does concern me that you’re feeling upset about it. 

00:04:25
PETER Alright. 

00:04:25
MARY And I am getting the grief from the workers as well, I mean you thought about the natural wastage, you know if they… the like… if you let a couple go, or some… 

00:04:35
PETER What about this nurturing… 

00:04:35
MARY …we’ve got lots of workers, so is bound to be some that you’re not so… so maybe you could increase the allowances of some workers and let go over couple other ones I mean in fact you’re was telling me. 

00:04:45
PETER You… You seem to have lost touch with the real world. 

00:04:50
MARY Well, what do you mean? What are you getting at that? 

00:04:50
PETER Well, like… 

00:04:55
MARY I mean I have to deal with the real world of money and finance and… 

00:04:55
PETER Yeah… 

00:04:55
MARY …and everything else. 

00:04:55
PETER …but remember, we’re working… we’ve… you know we got the youth workers, they are working part-time and the workforce of our service and… and um… you know, we are supposed to be a nurturing and sort of caring service within the county, and then we’re cutting their allowance, come on… 

00:05:20
MARY Well yeah because that’s… that's the real world of (inaudible ) you know, when you in some ways you’ll know in the real world because I have got you, I mean I really thought to retain the budget that we have got, and if… if they’d got their way the first time we’d have been down to cut… 

00:05:35
PETER You should have fought a bit harder. 

00:05:35
MARY I did, I fought as hard as I could. 

00:05:40
PETER Well… 

00:05:40
MARY I don’t… you quite understand some of the pressures that we are under sometime. I mean, I do, I can see that it has put you under pressure… 

00:05:45
PETER Ouch. 

00:05:45
MARY …but don't get me wrong in that. 

00:05:50
PETER Pressure? pressure? My God, I’m having sleepless nights, I… I… I don't… I don't know how to sort of deal with some of these problems, you know the staff are coming to me threatening industrial action and all sorts and I am just at a point and that’s why I have asked to see you. I mean okay as briefly… 

00:06:05
MARY No, no, you are right too, you are right too. Go on. 

00:06:10
PETER …brief, it is, because I think, you know, we… we really need to solve this out and I am just so… so… totally fed up with it whole. 

00:06:20
MARY Yeah, yeah, no, no, I know it’s… it’s difficult, and I am just thinking, I mean can you… can you be specific with me about any particular problem, that's what's… what’s the biggest… what is the biggest problem that you feel like you are facing at the moment? 

00:06:40
PETER Well, I think… I think I have told you, I think I have told you and… 

00:06:40
MARY This industrial action thing? 

00:06:45
PETER Well, that the fact, the fact that… 

00:06:45
MARY that they’ve actually go to the union yet, do you know that? 

00:06:50
PETER I don't know, I don't know, but all I know. 

00:06:50
MARY But who is the Union (inaudible ) of the… if you workers… 

00:06:55
PETER I think its Janice(ph). 

00:06:55
MARY Right and does she… has she come to you in a formal capacity yet. 

00:07:00
PETER Well, no what I have had this sort of… of knocking at the door, you know, they have had the letter for me… 

00:07:05
MARY Yeah. 

00:07:05
PETER …knocking at the door, and just going mad and like the same way we are not prepared to do this, you know we are gonna have to take further action, and… and I just feel totally inundated with all these complaints, but you know regularly that's your job, isn’t it? You know, it’s to sort of deal with that. 

00:07:25
MARY Well yeah, but you… you well its yes and no, I said you’re the you are the manager in the centre and certainly I know it’s… I know it’s hard, and in the same way and I suppose you have to deal with those your set of work ‘coz I have to deal with a lot of… 

00:07:40
PETER Hmm… 

00:07:40
MARY …people in your position, all over the county, so in a sense we are in the same position, you know, and it’s hard for both of us, who is just as you know, it is just as hard for both of us I think. 

00:07:55
PETER Well, I… I just don't know what to do. I really don't know what… I mean even to the point, I think I I (inaudible ) well, I may have even resign, because I just had I’ve headed up to here. I don't feel I am getting a support. I don't feel that I haven't… 

00:08:15
MARY Well, what else I don't know what else it is Peter that you want me to do, because I can't change the money situation, so I mean, what is it that you want me to do? I could support you in speaking to the workers, I am quite happy to do that, and if that helps you, then that is the way, that I would offer you support, but I cannot change the money. 

00:08:40
PETER Well, I mean by offering to talk to the workers, what do you think, is there going to be any gain from that? Is that… 

00:08:50
MARY Well, I don't know at least I will see perhaps that it’s not… that it’s not you… you… I mean their focus would probably tend to be on you, wouldn't it? 

00:09:00
PETER Oh there is very much of it. 

00:09:00
MARY And so at least they’ve go somewhere else to you know this… the two of us together so, I suppose we’re presenting, you know, um… a front and… and… and you know, united… 

00:09:10
PETER Yeah probably united. I mean, I don't feel, I feel totally isolated. I feel totally alone and I’m having to deal with all the shit that comes my way. 

00:09:25
MARY Well, what… what I mean to say the money can't be worked but… but I mean what… what solution are you talking about? 

00:09:30
PETER And the money, I mean well, I mean the mere fact that the staff have had half an hour… 

00:09:35
MARY Yeah. 

00:09:35
PETER …on top of that. 

00:09:35
MARY Yeah. 

00:09:40
PETER …sessions, and they you know told their preparation plan in time, was going out of the window overnight. It hasn't you know even been implemented in a over a phased way or anything can just go like, they are going to make these cuts, this is my budget, and the story you know, all you are worried about is the money, and that we are dealing with the people, and at the end of the day, we are dealing… they are dealing with the young people, and which is getting nowhere. 

00:10:05
MARY Yeah, but it is not my fault, the money I mean that's… that's county, who will listen it? I can't you know as I say I fought as hard as I could for the money that we got there is nothing you know… 

00:10:20
PETER Hmm… 

00:10:20
MARY it’s a stuck situation in that senses, you know that’s the… 

00:10:25
PETER Well (inaudible ) and I go… 

00:10:26
MARY Well, I don't, I don't think it’s as dramatic as that, and I don't, don't want you to go. 

00:10:35
PETER Well, I am honestly, I am… I don't know, I know you’ve offered to um… talk to the staff and maybe that’s the way forward, maybe, but you know what I was hoping for you to say now, you must have some slush money from somewhere you know… 

00:10:50
MARY No. 

00:10:50
PETER …in a little pocket… 

00:10:55
MARY What makes you think that? 

00:10:55
PETER Well, I know about these black (inaudible ), you know within the county and you know the… we have always seen as a Cinderella of the service, you know, we are educational, we are… we are sort of about working in an informal way, we young people and I know, I mean not (inaudible ), I know there is pockets of money, maybe that's what I should be doing I should be going you know, talking to my local councilor, and… 

00:11:25
MARY By all means… 

00:11:25
PETER …and then… 

00:11:25
MARY …if you can find a way to get extra funding… 

00:11:25
PETER Yeah. 

00:11:25
MARY …for the center, I am not going to stand in your way, but I haven’t got any… you know, there’s nothing that I have got. There is nothing that I can offer you, even if I was to do that with you I’d had to do that with all the centers and obviously, that’s out of the question. Sorry about this. 

00:11:50
MARY Hello, yeah okay well, I will be there in about you know about five minutes and… and where shall I meet you? Okay, alright. See you then, bye. Okay. Sorry about that. 

00:12:15
PETER Well, so you are going soon, are you? 

00:12:15
MARY Well, I said you know, we… we didn't have very long, so… 

00:12:20
PETER So… 

00:12:20
MARY …but I don't see… I don't see… 

00:12:20
PETER Where we gonna go from here? 

00:12:25
MARY Well, we can't change the situation, I mean what we can talk about maybe next time is um… we could talk about how… you and maybe you could give some thought to which workers, you think would… you know, sort of benefit by… 

00:12:45
PETER Can I… Can I take (inaudible ) offer you suggested earlier, about talking to the staff? Talking to them? 

00:12:50
MARY Yeah, yeah, that's (inaudible ). Yeah. 

00:12:51
PETER I will arrange… I will arrange… 

00:12:51
MARY You arrange a meeting, you give me a ring. 

00:12:55
PETER Yeah, but be prepared there might be union reps there. 

00:12:55
MARY Okay, okay we will. 

00:13:00
PETER And, I… 

00:13:00
MARY I will do my best. 

00:13:00
PETER I think I will think about my position as well. 

00:13:05
MARY Well, I don't want you to… to go, you know. So that's… that's… that's what I would say Peter. 

00:13:10
PETER Right. 

00:13:10
MARY Alright. 

00:13:10
PETER Well, I am not happy Mary, I am not happy at all. 

00:13:15
MARY Okay, but I am sorry, but it can't be helped. 

00:13:20
PETER Hmm… 

00:13:25
Good Practice Bad Practice 

00:13:25
MIKE STEVENS If you need to pause the tape to make any more notes, this is the time to do so. Otherwise, let's have a look at the Good Practice Session. 

00:13:35
Good Practice 

00:13:40
MARY Hi Peter, you wanted to talk to me about something. 

00:13:45
PETER Yeah, yeah, thanks for coming, but um… we… we really have a major problem in our hands, uh… you know these cutbacks, you’d had to implant because of your rationalization program, um… its created major problems. I mean they… the staff are really angry, that we have cut two hours of their… 

00:14:05
MARY Hmm… 

00:14:05
PETER of their three hours session. 

00:14:05
MARY Hmm… 

00:14:10
PETER And I am just so angry and frustrated because I am… I am just pulling my hair out, you know. They are… They are making all sorts of threats to me… 

00:14:20
MARY Right. 

00:14:20
PETER …you know, and I am… I am… I am really… I am really [00:14:25pissed off. 

00:14:20
MARY Hmm… Hmm. 

00:14:20
PETER And I just don’t know what way to turn. I don't know, how to sort of handle all these staff coming at me… 

00:14:35
MARY Right. 

00:14:35
PETER …um… all time, and you know, I recognize the fact that you… you’ve had to sort of implement this rationalization program, but I mean that it's affected, it's affected us all… 

00:14:50
MARY Right, right. 

00:14:50
PETER …certainly affected the part-time staff and then our workforce. 

00:14:55
MARY Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:15:00
PETER You know and I… I really-really… I don't know, I just don't know, how to… to handle it because they are the threat… they are threatening industrial action… 

00:15:10
MARY Right. 

00:15:10
PETER …they are threatening you know, (inaudible ). 

00:15:13
MARY Right. 

00:15:15
PETER You know, I am in my office sitting there and you know, I just… at all the time. 

00:15:20
MARY Right, right, okay so if I can just summarize a little bit with these cuts, and me having to implement them, and then you having to implement them, its resulted in sort of feelings of frustration for you, because the workers have responded obviously angrily… 

00:15:40
PETER Yeah. 

00:15:40
MARY …and you felt quite overwhelmed really with them coming back. 

00:15:45
PETER And I am angry with you… 

00:15:45
MARY Right. 

00:15:45
PETER …because you know, I’ve had to implement these cuts… 

00:15:50
MARY Right, right, so you should be in so left in the… 

00:15:55
PETER Yeah, yeah, I mean yeah… 

00:15:55
MARY That hurt(ph) really. 

00:15:55
PETER … yeah. I have, I just… just sort of filled totally out of control really… 

00:16:00
MARY Right. 

00:16:00
PETER …in terms of you know what's going on… 

00:16:05
MARY Right. 

00:16:05
PETER …because you know I am… you’ve had to sort of you've told us what you know it’s… this is our budget… 

00:16:10
MARY Yes. 

00:16:15
PETER …unlike the only rational way was to sort of implement these cuts. 

00:16:15
MARY Right. 

00:16:20
PETER …but you know, I am at this end, you know… 

00:16:20
MARY Yeah. How do you take the ). 

00:16:24
PETER …at the grass root end, and I am… I am just… just taking all the flank and I am just sort of really, really, I have had enough, I have had enough. 

00:16:35
MARY Okay, so you feel fed up with it. 

00:16:35
PETER I… well, I am so angry that I mean, you know, I’m thinking of resigning. 

00:16:40
MARY Okay, so you've… 

00:16:40
PETER Because, I have just… I have just headed up to you, and you know I don't know… I don't know, you know, the staff are quite venomous. 

00:16:55
MARY Hmm… Hmm… 

00:16:55
PETER They are quite venomous and… 

00:16:55
MARY Right. 

00:16:55
PETER …and I am the one, that's still taken all the fact… 

00:17:00
MARY Hmm… Hmm. 

00:17:00
PETER …and you know, you just popped down from your Ivory(ph) tower, and you know… 

00:17:05
MARY So you feel, I just sort of float in and float out again. 

00:17:10
PETER What, yeah… 

00:17:10
MARY And… And you are kind of left… 

00:17:10
PETER …yeah. 

00:17:10
MARY …to get on with it. 

00:17:10
PETER Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:10
MARY That's your experience so… 

00:17:10
PETER Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:15
MARY …I am wondering what kind of support I could offer to you… 

00:17:20
PETER Well… 

00:17:20
MARY …and that which… 

00:17:20
PETER I mean, I am like the (inaudible ) you know… 

00:17:23
MARY Right. 

00:17:25
PETER Ah… yeah. Um… well, I mean support, ah… I feel… I feel I need… I feel… I need a lot of support. 

00:17:40
MARY Right. 

00:17:40
PETER At this moment of time. 

00:17:40
MARY Hmm… Hmm 

00:17:45
PETER …and I am an experienced worker and you know we have always sort of managed to deal with our budget as… as we have… 

00:17:50
MARY Yeah, you’ve have always done it very well. 

00:17:55
PETER …I just, I just feel that this time, we you know, we’re faced with an awful burden… 

00:18:00
MARY Yeah. 

00:18:00
PETER …and… and its… its affected the staff, I mean because at the end of the day we are working with young people, you know, really… 

00:18:10
MARY Hmm… Hmm. 

00:18:10
PETER …that's the most important thing isn't it, you know, working with young people, and… and… 

00:18:15
MARY So in a way you feel that… that having to implement these cuts has affected your relationship with the staff. 

00:18:25
PETER Yes, yes. 

00:18:25
MARY Yeah. 

00:18:25
PETER Yes. 

00:18:25
MARY And some of them have been quite poisonous, as you say. 

00:18:30
PETER Yeah, I mean, I am thinking over… 

00:18:30
MARY and their responses to you. 

00:18:30
PETER Yeah, the threats of… of so going to the union, you know taking industrial action walking out… 

00:18:35
MARY Right. 

00:18:35
PETER …is really… 

00:18:40
MARY Right. 

00:18:40
PETER …sort of hurt. 

00:18:40
MARY Yeah. 

00:18:40
PETER I feel wounded. 

00:18:45
MARY Yeah. 

00:18:45
PETER And, (inaudible ). 

00:18:46
MARY Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:50
PETER And, I’m quite angry about that. 

00:18:50
MARY Yes, yes I do hear you saying that you are angry with me… 

00:18:55
PETER Hmm. 

00:18:55
MARY …that you feel left alone with these 

00:19:00
PETER I said I did. 

00:19:00
MARY …cuts… 

00:19:00
PETER Yeah. 

00:19:00
MARY Right, and on the one hand you got the workers sort of responding in… 

00:19:05
PETER Hmm. 

00:19:05
MARY …degrees of anger with you, and on the other hand, then I just come in, and then I zoom off again… 

00:19:10
PETER Hmm. 

00:19:10
MARY …as you see it and… 

00:19:10
PETER Hmm. 

00:19:10
MARY …therefore you are left and you feel like without much support so… 

00:19:15
PETER Hmm. 

00:19:15
MARY …angry with me about the cuts and I guess angry with me for leaving you to sort of go on with it, you know. 

00:19:20
PETER Hmm… Hmm. 

00:19:20
MARY And… 

00:19:25
PETER Yeah, I mean Mary is just a name I mean… 

00:19:25
MARY Yes. 

00:19:25
PETER Staff don’t know Mary… 

00:19:25
MARY Yes, yes, yes 

00:19:25
PETER …that’s you. 

00:19:30
MARY Yes. 

00:19:30
PETER I learnt a… I mean I see you at the moment as you know this big (inaudible ) but we… are implement all these cuts and… 

00:19:40
MARY Yeah. 

00:19:40
PETER …it is so unfair. 

00:19:40
MARY Yeah, yeah. 

00:19:45
PETER Alright. 

00:19:45
MARY Is there… you know, is there anything that I can do to support you that… that strikes you, I mean, I can think of a few things myself… 

00:19:55
PETER Hmm… Hmm. 

00:19:55
MARY …but I am… I am just… just wondering if… 

00:19:55
PETER Well… Well could we… could we look at the budget? I mean you know could we… I am not saying go back, you know because I think, we have implemented something now, but we look at the budget. I mean is that what you are saying? 

00:20:10
MARY We could… We could look at the budget and look at the different ways of how to implement it and in you know variety of ways and perhaps and I can help you with that because I sort of used to doing that to…. 

00:20:20
PETER Yeah. 

00:20:20
MARY …in long ways. 

00:20:20
PETER Well obviously you must have a lot of skills you know in terms of budgetary and financial control and you know that… that I would appreciate that. 

00:20:30
MARY Right. Well I can’t change the world necessarily, but we can… 

00:20:35
PETER No… no. 

00:20:35
MARY But we can… we can… we can certainly look at it and I can… 

00:20:40
PETER I just think… 

00:20:40
MARY talk through… 

00:20:40
PETER …if you could ease… 

00:20:40
MARY …issues. 

00:20:40
PETER if we could ease the, that you know the problem. I mean you know I’m the manager and now I have to deal with this, but I just… I don’t know if it's about compromise or just diffuse in our field and I feel… 

00:20:55
MARY Yeah. 

00:20:55
PETER …somehow we need to… 

00:20:55
MARY Yeah. 

00:20:55
PETER …diffuse the situation. 

00:21:00
MARY Right, right, yeah. 

00:21:00
PETER Yeah. 

00:21:00
MARY Yeah. 

00:21:00
PETER And I would appreciate… 

00:21:00
MARY Yeah. 

00:21:05
PETER …you know any… any help… 

00:21:05
MARY Yeah. 

00:21:05
PETER …that you can give me on that. 

00:21:05
MARY Yeah I wonder if you would take some of the heat of you if I went in and came with you to meet the team, we call to meeting or something. 

00:21:15
PETER That would be fantastic that really would, I think that would really… really help definitely because then what I can… I suppose here it from the horse’s(ph) mouth gone by, but also you know we… we have been a very good team. 

00:21:30
MARY Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:30
PETER And we worked really well. 

00:21:30
MARY Yeah. 

00:21:35
PETER And you know maybe that… that might help us as well because if you're of… 

00:21:40
MARY Right. 

00:21:40
PETER …sort of… 

00:21:40
MARY Right. 

00:21:40
PETER …part of that and making a contribution. 

00:21:45
MARY Yeah. 

00:21:45
PETER Yeah, probably… 

00:21:45
MARY I’m wondering if you are also sort of partially saying that you would… you would like to see me more often because I’m aware that I haven’t had sessions with you for the last couple of months really. 

00:21:55
PETER That’s right when anything you know you get involved when… when there is a problem… 

00:22:00
MARY Right… right. 

00:22:00
PETER And you know that's okay I may’ve sounded a bit defensive at the beginning, but it’s because maybe when you know… yeah I would if we could meet regularly… 

00:22:15
MARY Right. 

00:22:15
PETER …and you know may be these sort of problems wouldn’t be based so bad. 

00:22:20
MARY Okay so it might… might help you to feel more supported as well as… 

00:22:25
PETER Yeah. 

00:22:25
MARY …taking a more proactive role (crosstalk (inaudible ) kind of fighting, kind of. 

00:22:30
PETER Yeah… yeah. I felt very… very much alone and isolated and you know I’m sort of you know like a crisis management situation and I don’t… I don’t able to come out that really. 

00:22:45
MARY Okay. 

00:22:45
PETER And… 

00:22:45
MARY Okay we will perhaps make a call another meeting then to look at some strategies to help you to do more support and also perhaps within the staff as well but do… do some of that and set up a meeting quite… quite close to now, really quite soon. 

00:23:05
PETER Yeah that would be great… that would be great and if I… 

00:23:05
MARY Okay. 

00:23:05
PETER …if I fix up a… 

00:23:10
MARY …staff meeting. 

00:23:10
PETER Yeah staff meeting and… and get… you know get them all together. 

00:23:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:23:15
PETER …and then say. 

00:23:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:23:20
PETER …you know that Mary is going to come and talk to them. 

00:23:20
MARY Yeah. 

00:23:20
PETER Just about all the rationalization program. 

00:23:25
MARY Yeah. 

00:23:25
PETER That would be a good idea. 

00:23:25
MARY That would be fine. Yeah, absolutely. 

00:23:25
PETER Yeah. Thank you. 

00:23:30
MARY Okay thank you. 

00:23:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay I wonder what you made of that. If you want a few more minutes to finish your notes or if you want to discuss what you’ve seen with colleagues assuming you're watching this with colleagues then this is the time to press pause otherwise we will get straight back into the sessions. By keeping an eye on the time code, we will be able to check your notes against my comments. 

00:24:00
Bad Practice 

00:24:00
MARY Okay then, Peter you… you called me to and I said I could you know I could give you ten minutes to you had a problem with some of the workers or something so perhaps you could tell me. 

00:24:10
PETER I am just totally pissed off… 

00:24:10
MIKE SIMMONS And from the very start we can see that there are likely to be difficulties here. How do you think that you had a problem with some of the workers or something felt. Clearly he had given us some idea of why he wanted this meeting and she is already indicating that she probably wasn’t listening to him that carefully when he did so. Is she going to be listening anymore carefully this time? 

00:24:35
PETER We’ve had to implement all that… that the rationalization program for the resources and you know… 

00:24:45
MARY Yeah it’s all over the country isn’t it? 

00:24:45
PETER And… 

00:24:45
MIKE SIMMONS That “Yeah it’s all over the country, isn’t it?” Takes it away from his personal problem and turns it into a generalization. 

00:24:55
PETER …threat industrial action, you know we have to implement the… the pay cut you know they’ve… they were on three hours now we have reduced that down and… 

00:25:05
MARY Yeah they haven’t actually have their rates of pay reduced… they have just… they have their hours reduced don’t mean that’s the same probably these workers are… 

00:25:10
PETER And though we can see the point she is making, they haven’t actually had a pay cut, we can see that she is not really seeing things from his point of view or from that of his workers. You might also want to think a little about the fact that she is eating while she talks. This could be a working lunch of course, but he doesn’t seem to be eating anything himself. There is something dismissive about what she is doing here. 

00:25:35
PETER I mean you are telling us this of being work out our budgets probably and I just think this is a impossible responsibility and… 

00:25:45
MARY Yeah well I’m sorry is given you grief you know and… and I don’t wanted to you know I mean I always see I do… I do… it does concern me that you are feeling upset about it. And… And I’m going to grief from the workers as well I mean we thought about a natural wastage you know if they… the… like if you let a couple go or some… some… 

00:26:05
MIKE SIMMONS Two things here, is this the moment for her to be talking about her problems. I’m getting grief from the workers as well she says and also is this the moment to start looking for a solution that natural wastage certainly seems to go against the brain. But even if it didn’t we might think it better for him to be allowed to talk rather more about his problems as he sees some before she jumps in with a solution. He is you seem to have lost touch with the real world would certainly seem to suggest that he doesn’t really feel that she is understanding his situation. 

00:26:45
PETER …within the county and then we are cutting their allowance. Come on. 

00:26:50
MARY Well yeah because that’s… the real world of budgets you know. I mean in some ways you’ll know in the real world and because I’ve got you, I mean I really fought to retain the budget that we’ve got and if… if they… 

00:27:05
MIKE SIMMONS This discussion about who is in the real world isn’t helping anybody. When she says I really fought retaining the budget that we’ve got, she maybe speaking the absolute truth, but this isn’t the time to be saying it. He has to be able to talk about his concerns, but she seems keen that he should simply see things from her point of view. 

00:27:25
PETER …sort of deal with some of these problems, you know the staff are coming to me through an industrial action and all sorts in… I’m just at a point and that’s I have asked to see you. 

00:27:40
MARY Hmm… 

00:27:40
PETER I mean okay… 

00:27:40
MARY No… no… you're right too… you're right too. 

00:27:45
PETER that brief is because I think you know we… we really need to solve this out and I’m just so… so totally fed up with the whole. 

00:27:55
MARY Yeah… yeah. No… no. I know it’s… it’s difficult and I’m just thinking I mean can you… can you be specific with me about any particular problem that’s was… was… was the biggest was the biggest problem that you feel like you're facing at the moment. 

00:28:10
PETER Well I think… I think I have told you. I think… 

00:28:15
MIKE SIMMONS She says she knows it’s difficult, but has she shown this in anyway, I don’t think so. She asks him to be specific and of course he already has been. So he feels even more unheard. ”I think I’ve told you,” he says. 

00:28:30
MARY This industrial action thing… 

00:28:30
PETER Well the… the fact that… 

00:28:35
MARY Have they’d actually gone to the union yet? Do you that? 

00:28:35
PETER I don’t know… I don’t know, but all I know… 

00:28:40
MARY Who is the union rep of the… of your workers? 

00:28:40
PETER I think it’s Janice(ph). 

00:28:45
MARY Right and… does she… has she come to you in a formal capacity yet? 

00:28:45
PETER Well… 

00:28:50
MIKE SIMMONS See how these string of questions makes him lose his thread for a moment. It’s easy enough to see who is concerned of being exercised to this point. 

00:29:00
PETER Say we… we are not prepared to do this you know we are going to have further action and… and I just feel totally inundated with all these complaints that you know… that’s you job isn’t it? You know it’s… sort of deal with that. 

00:29:15
MARY Well yeah, but you… you (inaudible ) yes and no I see you are… you are the… manager in the center and certainly I know it’s… I know it’s hard and in the same manner suppose that you have to deal with those your set of workers. I have to deal with a lot of people in your position all over the county so in a… 

00:29:35
MIKE SIMMONS Does she know it’s hard for him or for her. She seems to be talking about her position here not his. Again she could be under tremendous pressure herself. But is he the person she should be talking to about it all and if he is, is this the moment she should be doing it? 

00:29:55
PETER I read(ph) it well. I may even resign… because I just had, affect up to here. I don’t feel I’m getting the support and I don’t feel that I’m… 

00:30:05
MARY Well what else I… I don’t know what else it is the piece of the you want me to do because I can’t… 

00:30:10
MIKE SIMMONS See what he is saying here. I don’t feel that I’m getting the support. He is talking about her, about the support that she is not giving him and she needs to acknowledge that. All she seems to be doing, is looking for solutions. I think we can see from his body language that this isn’t really what he was looking for. 

00:30:35
PETER Well, I mean by offering to talk to the workers what… what do you thinks is it going to be any gain from that? Is that… 

00:30:40
MARY Well, I… I don’t know. At least I’ll see perhaps that is not… that it’s not to do with you. I mean their focus would… would probably tend to be on you, wouldn’t it? 

00:30:50
PETER Oh, it is very much… 

00:30:50
MARY And… And so at least they’ve got somewhere else to… you know just the two of us together. So, I suppose we are presenting you know um… fronts and… and you know, united. 

00:31:05
PETER Yeah, but are we united? I mean I don’t feel… I feel totally isolated. I feel totally alone and I’m at… 

00:31:15
MIKE SIMMONS “But are we united? I feel totally isolated,” he says. Again, he is talking about their relationship how he experiences her as a manager. And again, she ignores what he is saying. 

00:31:30
MARY Say the money can’t be worked but… but I mean what… what sort of shit you are talking about? 

00:31:35
PETER And the money, I mean, well… 

00:31:35
MIKE SIMMONS What shit are you talking about? He’s being telling her for the last six and half minutes, but she is not listening. 

00:31:45
PETER …for that preparation planning time has gone out of the window, overnight. It hasn’t, you know, even being implemented in a… sort of a… a phase way or anything gets just right, Oh gonna make these cuts. This is my budget and the story you know, all you are worried about is the money and like we are dealing with people and at the end of the day, we are dealing… they are dealing with the end people and we are just getting nowhere. 

00:32:10
MARY Yeah, but it’s not my fault, the money. I mean, that’s… that’s county… 

00:32:10
MIKE SIMMONS He tells her again, but again, she is not really listening. For all we know, she maybe telling the truth when she says, it’s not my fault, but she just being defensive now. All she needs to be doing here is letting him say what he needs to say and to show that she has heard him. 

00:32:30
PETER No, that’s the… 

00:32:30
MARY I… I don’t… I don’t think it’s as dramatic as that and I don’t… don’t want you to go. 

00:32:40
PETER Well, I’m honestly um… 

00:32:40
MIKE SIMMONS When she says I don’t want you to go, this might be the only time in the session when he feels valued in any way. There’s just a slight sense that the meeting might be taking a turn for the better here. But it doesn’t last. 

00:32:55
PETER You must have some slush money from somewhere you know… 

00:33:00
MARY No. 

00:33:00
PETER …in a little pocket… 

00:33:00
MARY What makes you think that? 

00:33:05
PETER Well, I know about these (inaudible ) you know within the county and you know they… we… we are always seeing as a Cinderella of the service, you know, we are educational, we are… we’re… 

00:33:15
MIKE SIMMONS If they are the Cinderella of the service, it sounds very much as if he hopes that she might be the fairy Godmother, magicing(ph) out some money from somewhere. She responds to this on a surface level, no there is no money, but she doesn’t respond to the feelings behind the hope. 

00:33:35
MARY For the center I’m not going to stand in your way, but I haven’t got any you know, there is nothing that I’ve got. There is nothing that I can offer you, I mean if I was to do that with you’d have to do that with all the centers and obviously that’s how the question… 

00:33:55
MIKE SIMMONS There is a lot to be said about that phone. There are times of course when we have a meeting which we know might be interrupted by an important call. If that’s the case here, then she needed to warn him that, that might happen. She didn’t, so it’s fair to say that for the duration of the meeting, her mobile should have been switched off. And then the landline of the room should have been routed elsewhere. It wasn’t of course and she makes matters worse by answering the call without making so much as an apology to him before she does so. When she answered the call, she didn’t even tell the caller that she was in a meeting and would call back. She just got on with the call. His body language speaks volumes. 

00:34:45
MARY Okay, alright, see you then. Bye. Okay. Sorry about that. 

00:34:55
PETER So, you are going soon are you? 

00:34:55
MARY Well, I said you know we… we didn’t have very long, so but I don’t see you… 

00:35:00
MIKE SIMMONS So you are going soon, are you he says? She’d already told him that she only had 10 minutes, but it striking him now that he is not really going to get anything out of this meeting. There is a real sense of hopelessness which could have usefully being acknowledge, but of course she chooses not to. 

00:35:20
MARY …you know sort of benefit by… 

00:35:20
PETER Can I, can I… 

00:35:20
MIKE SIMMONS It’s probably fair to say that this session ends with their relationship worse than it was when it started. He obviously went to the meeting with some hope that something might come out of it. He has learned that this is not going to be the case. It’s not simply that she is not going to magic any money out for him, so, she is not going to be a support for him either. He felt alone before the meeting. Now, he knows that he is. 

00:35:50
PETER Alright. 

00:35:50
MARY Alright. 

00:35:50
PETER Well, I’m not happy Mary(ph). I’m not a bit too. 

00:35:55
MARY Okay, well I’m sorry, but it… it can’t be helped. 

00:36:00
PETER Hmm… 

00:36:05
Good Practice Bad Practice 

00:36:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, I wonder how your notes compared with mine. Now, have a look at the good practice session again. 

00:36:15
Good Practice 

00:36:20
MARY Hi, Peter you wanted to talk to me about something. 

00:36:20
PETER Yeah, yeah, thanks for coming, but um… we, we really have a major problem… 

00:36:25
MIKE SIMMONS And there is an interesting difference to the start of the session. Can you see how saying you wanted to talk to me about something, has a very different feeling to the start of the previous session. You had a problem with some of your workers or something. See how she is just giving him the floor, leaving him to tell her what he wants to tell her without interruption. In fact, except for the (inaudible ) encourage her, he speaks for more than a minute without to saying anything. 

00:36:55
MARY Right. 

00:36:55
PETER … you know and umm… I’m… I’m really… I’m really pissed off. 

00:37:00
MARY Hmm… Hmm… 

00:37:05
PETER And I just don’t know what way to turn, I don’t know how to sort of handle all these staffs coming at me… 

00:37:10
MARY Right. 

00:37:15
PETER …um… all the time um… and you know I recognize the fact that you… you’ve had to sort of implement this rationalization program, but I mean that it’s affected… it’s affected us all. You know. 

00:37:30
MARY Right, right. 

00:37:30
PETER And certainly affected the part time staff and there our workforce. 

00:37:35
MARY Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:37:35
PETER And I really, really… I don’t know, I just don’t know how to… to handle it because they are… they’re threatened, they’re threatened an industrial action… 

00:37:45
MARY Right. 

00:37:50
PETER They are threatening you know civil (inaudible ). 

00:37:52
MARY Right. 

00:37:52
PETER You know, I’m in my office sitting there and you know they just at me all the time. 

00:37:55
MARY Right, right, okay. So, if I can just summarize a little bit, with these cuts and me having to… 

00:38:05
MIKE SIMMONS And when she does speak is to show that she is heard him not to contradict him or to tell him what it feels like for her point of view. 

00:38:15
MARY Because the workers have responded obviously, angrily… 

00:38:20
PETER Yeah. 

00:38:20
MARY …and you’ve got quiet overwhelm really with them coming back. 

00:38:25
PETER I am… and I am angry with you. 

00:38:25
MARY Right. 

00:38:25
PETER Because you know I’ve had to implement these cuts… 

00:38:30
MARY Right. 

00:38:30
MIKE SIMMONS He is angry with her and he tells her that and she accepts it. Again, he feels hurt and this time, he is able to talk about what he is feeling. 

00:38:40
MARY Right. 

00:38:40
PETER …in terms you know, what’s going on… 

00:38:40
MARY Right. 

00:38:45
PETER …and because you know and you’ve had to… sort of you’ve… you’ve told us what you know, this is our budget… 

00:38:50
MARY Yes. 

00:38:50
PETER …and like the only rational way was to sort of implement these cuts. 

00:38:55
MARY Right. 

00:38:55
PETER But, you know, I’m… I’m at this end, you know… 

00:39:00
MARY Yeah. 

00:39:00
PETER …at the (inaudible )… 

00:39:02
MARY I can take the fact. 

00:39:02
PETER …and I’m… I’m just… just taking all the flank and I’m just sort of really-really I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough. 

00:39:10
MARY Okay, so you feel full up with it? 

00:39:10
PETER Alright. Well… 

00:39:15
MIKE SIMMONS Taking the flack, feel full up with it, again she is showing him that she understands what it feels like from his point of view. She is showing empathy. 

00:39:25
PETER I’m so angry that I mean you know I’m thinking of resigning. 

00:39:30
MARY Okay. So you've… 

00:39:30
PETER Because I’ve just… I’ve just headed up to here. 

00:39:40
MIKE SIMMONS Again when he tells her that he is thinking of leaving, she simply accepts it. We saw in the previous session that when she said that she didn’t want him to go, he may have thought just a little valued in some way, but she was responding there to the surface of what he was saying rather than the feelings that lead to that statement. By not saying anything by simply accepting what he is saying we can see that she is taking his underlying concerns seriously and that’s what he needs. 

00:40:10
PETER Um… you know… 

00:40:10
MARY So you feel that I just sort of float in and float out again. 

00:40:15
PETER What yeah… 

00:40:15
MARY And… And you are kind of left to get on with it, that’s your experience. 

00:40:20
PETER Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:20
MARY So, I’m wondering what kind of support I could offer to you. 

00:40:25
MIKE SIMMONS Float in and float out, again we can see that she understands what it feels like to him. She doesn’t try to defend her position. She simply demonstrates some empathy. Compare, I’m wondering what kind of support I can offer you with the way in which the concept of support was handled in the last session. 

00:40:50
PETER Well, I mean support. Um… I… I feel… I feel I need to I feel… I need a lot of support. 

00:41:00
MARY Right. 

00:41:00
PETER At this moment. 

00:41:00
MIKE SIMMONS “I need a lot of support,” he says and he is able to demonstrate this vulnerability and his need for her help because he is feeling hurt by her. 

00:41:10
PETER You know, we’ve always sort of managed to deal with our budget as… as… 

00:41:20
MARY Yeah. 

00:41:20
PETER We have. 

00:41:20
MARY You’ve always dealt it very well. 

00:41:20
PETER Well I just… I just feel that this time… 

00:41:20
MIKE SIMMONS You’ve always done very well, she says. She is acknowledging his strengths. 

00:41:30
PETER …burdened. 

00:41:30
MARY Yeah. 

00:41:30
PETER And… and its… it’s affected the staff I mean, because at the end of the day we are working with young people. You know, really that’s the most important thing isn’t it… 

00:41:40
MARY Hmm… 

00:41:40
PETER You know, working with young people and… and… 

00:41:45
MARY So in a way you feel that… that having to implement these cuts has affected your relationship with the staff. 

00:41:50
PETER Yes… yes… 

00:41:50
MARY Yeah. 

00:41:50
PETER Yes. 

00:41:55
MARY And some of them have quite poisonous as you say. 

00:41:55
PETER Yeah and I mean I never speak… 

00:41:55
MARY …responds to you. 

00:42:00
PETER Yeah the threats of… of… 

00:42:00
MIKE SIMMONS “Affected your relationship. Some of them have been quite poisonous.” She is steadily paraphrasing what he said. Showing him he is been heard. She is also quite clearly showing that she is in his corner that they are on the same side. She is accepting the decisions that she has made have caused him problems and now she is working with him to find a way of dealing with them. 

00:42:25
MARY Yes… yes I… I do hear you saying that you are angry with me. That you feel left alone with these… 

00:42:35
PETER Isolated, yeah 

00:42:35
MARY …cuts. Right and on the one hand you’ve got the workers sort of responding in… 

00:42:40
PETER Hmm… 

00:42:40
MARY …degrees of anger with you and on the other hand then I just come in and then I zoom off again. 

00:42:45
PETER Hmm… 

00:42:45
MARY …as you see it and therefore you are left and you feel like without much support. So, angry with me about the cuts and I guess angry with me for leaving you to sort of get on with it you know. 

00:42:55
PETER Hmm… 

00:43:00
MIKE SIMMONS Again he is able to say that he is angry with her and she accepts it. She doesn’t defend herself, but shows that she is accepting his feelings. 

00:43:10
PETER You know this big (inaudible ) that we’ve got to implement all these cuts… 

00:43:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:43:15
PETER … and it’s just so unfair. 

00:43:15
MARY Yeah… Yeah. Is that you know, is there anything that I can do to support you that… that strikes you I mean, I can think of a few things myself… 

00:43:30
PETER Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:30
MARY That um… I’m just… just wondering if… 

00:43:30
PETER Could we… could we look at the budget? Could we… I mean… you know could we… I’m not saying go back. You know, because I think we’ve implemented something now, but could we look at the budget? I mean, is that what you say? 

00:43:45
MARY We could… We could look at the budget and look at the different ways of how to implement it in you know, variety of ways and perhaps I can help you with that. Because I’m so used to doing that in… 

00:44:00
PETER Yeah well, obviously, (inaudible ) have a lot of skills you know, in terms of budgetary and financial control and you know, that… that I would appreciate. 

00:44:10
MARY Really well, I can't change the world necessarily, but we can… 

00:44:10
PETER No… No… 

00:44:10
MARY …we can… we can certainly look at it and I can go through it… 

00:44:15
PETER I just think that we could… if we could… 

00:44:15
MIKE SIMMONS “Is there anything I can do?” Again he wants to look at the budget, but it’s important to note that she doesn’t suggest that there is going to be any major change. “I can’t change the world,” she says, but she will help him to make the best of what seems to be a very difficult situation. 

00:44:35
MARY Right. Yeah. 

00:44:35
PETER Yeah. Um… and I would appreciate you know, any… any help that you can give me on that. 

00:44:40
MARY Yeah. I wonder if would take some of the heat of you if I went in and came with you to meet the team. We call to meeting or something. 

00:44:50
PETER That would be fantastic. That really would I think that would really-really help definitely because then what I can, I suppose…. 

00:45:00
MIKE SIMMONS And as in the last session, she offers to visit, but we can see here by his enthusiastic response that he feels supportive by this, that she is prepared to be in there with him. Even though the previous session had the same apparent outcome that she was going to visit, his feelings about it a very different. 

00:45:20
MARY I’m wondering if you’ll say sort of partially saying that you’d… you’d like to see me more often, because I’m aware that I haven’t… 

00:45:30
PETER Well… 

00:45:30
MARY …had sessions with you for the last couple of months really. 

00:45:30
PETER That’s right. When anything you… you know, you get involved when… when there is a problem. 

00:45:35
MARY Right… right. 

00:45:40
PETER And you know that. 

00:45:40
MIKE SIMMONS “I wonder if you’re saying, you’d like to see me more often.” She is acknowledging the part she has played in his feeling of isolation. 

00:45:50
PETER …meet regularly. 

00:45:50
MARY Right. 

00:45:50
PETER Um…and yeah, maybe these very sort of problems wouldn’t be so bad. 

00:45:55
MARY Okay. So it might… might help you to feel more supported as well as… 

00:46:00
PETER Yeah… Yeah. 

00:46:00
MARY …taken a more proactive role in terms of rather in a… 

00:46:05
PETER …yeah. 

00:46:05
MARY firefighting kind of thing. 

00:46:05
PETER Yeah… Yeah. 

00:46:05
MARY (crosstalk) (inaudible ). 

00:46:07
PETER And I feel very… much alone and isolated and, you know I am sort of… 

00:46:10
MARY Hmm… 

00:46:10
PETER And you know like a crisis management… 

00:46:15
MARY Hmm… 

00:46:15
PETER …situation and… 

00:46:15
MARY Hmm… 

00:46:15
PETER …I don’t able to come out that really. 

00:46:20
MARY Okay. 

00:46:20
PETER So, you know… 

00:46:20
MARY Okay. We will perhaps we can call another meeting then to… 

00:46:20
PETER Hmm… 

00:46:25
MARY …look at some strategies to… to help that bit real more supported, also perhaps within the staff as well. 

00:46:30
MIKE SIMMONS The session ends with the plan of action. The worker feels that he has got his manager support, he hasn’t been laid aware of her problems, which is appropriate. Her line manager is the one to listen to them, but he does feel that he has been heard and he is not going to be left alone with a very difficult situation. 

00:46:50
PETER …so you know that. 

00:46:50
MARY Yeah. 

00:46:55
PETER Mary is gonna come and talk to them. 

00:46:55
MARY Yeah. 

00:46:55
PETER And just about all the rationalization program. 

00:47:00
MARY Yeah. 

00:47:00
PETER That’ll be a good idea. 

00:47:00
MARY That would be fine. Yeah, absolutely. 

00:47:05
PETER Thanks. 

00:47:05
MARY Okay, thank you. 

00:47:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay that’s pretty much it. There is always a problem with any kind of session made in the studio, because both parties know what the indented outcome is. We want to make a video, maybe the good practice session would have ended quite so well, had it been in real life. But I suspect that the bad practice session would’ve ended just as badly regardless of the circumstances. The point being made here is that if we want people to feel heard, we’ve to listen to them and we’ve to show that we’re listening. We’ve to be able to let them express strong feelings without becoming defensive and we’ve to keep our own concerns to ourselves. None of this is easy of course, but it is still essential if the people you meet with are going to be able to say what they need to say. (inaudible ).

The school of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students, and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of the use of counseling skills and we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be awkward both in face to face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas and this series in common with our other material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. With you are trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who use his counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we’ll have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we’ve got to offer.
