Group Counseling: Process and Technique 

00:00:00
First Group 

00:00:10
GROUP LEADER Okay, good morning everybody. Welcome to our first group together, and the whole purpose of today in the first group is just to spend some time getting to know each other, and figuring out what it is that we want to get out of group and figure out why we're in the room, so we can prepare for our future meetings together. So, in that spirit, I guess what I would like to do is, is, just spend some time going around, uh, I would like you to say your name, introduce yourself to the group, and talk a little bit about what you would like to get out of group, sort of, why, why, you're here. So who would like to start? 

00:00:45
AMANDA I'll start. Uh, my name is Amanda and I have not been in groups before, but, um, I am, I have been in counseling and, um, I'm just in a stage in life where I'm really trying to figure out the balance between, um, stepping into professional roles, I just, um, I'm in grad school and am just, kind of like, entering that field. Um, but wanting to balance it out with, sort of, who I felt like I always was and, um, I find that I'm just really struggling to navigate ho-, how, to blend those two. Who I need to be in work, but also representing who I feel like I really am, so... 

00:01:25
GROUP LEADER I really like that word, balance. That you're trying to find balance in your life and that it's become difficult because you're moving into a transition. So this is a great time to explore that, because you're actually experiencing that lack of balance as you're making that move. 

00:01:40
AMANDA Yeah. 

00:01:45
GROUP LEADER So I think that would be a, an excellent thing to, to, try to coordinate here, uh, in this group. Thank you Amanda. 'K, who's next? 

00:01:55
KURT Uh, my name is Kurt, and, uh, I guess I was married for a while, for about five years, and recently, uh, I, we, we, we got divorced. I found out that she was seeing somebody else, and since that point, uh, I've been having problems, uh, just building trust in relationships, and, uh, just trusting others in general, and, uh, I guess what I wanted out of group was to maybe see, uh, ya know, see what a, ya know, trusting relationship kinda looks like, ya know, between people and how people relate, and, uh, maybe take something from that, and, and, use it in my, I guess, in my, uh, day to day life. So, that's kinda, wh-, why I'm here. 

00:02:40
GROUP LEADER Okay. So, you've experienced a pretty painful transition, it's a little bit different than, than what, Amanda, was, was, going through but the same type of, I guess, desire to regain a, sen-, a sense of, balance. 

00:02:55
KURT Mm-hmm. 

00:02:55
GROUP LEADER Now, now, you say you want to work on trust issues in group. 

00:03:00
KURT Mm-hmm. 

00:03:00
GROUP LEADER Um, obviously you're now, in a, in a, roomful of, of, strangers, I would, I would, guess for you, that, that, would produce a little bit , of, of, anxiety. 

00:03:10
KURT Yes, it does, it does. Um, and, uh, just hoping to see kinda where this goes, and, uh, maybe I'll, uh, get to know some people here in group and learn to trust 'em. 

00:03:20
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm, and, I, I, really appreciate your desire to reach out, um, even though you're experiencing that sense of pain, uh, from being betrayed and being hurt. I think a lot of people would have a tendency to withdrawal and, so, I think this group, uh, is a good way, a good courageous first step for you. 

00:03:45
KURT I'm lookin' forward to it. 

00:03:45
GROUP LEADER All right, (ph)thanks Kurt, nice. (ph) 

00:03:50
CHALEY I guess I'll go next. Um, my name's Chaley and I have been in groups, kind of like this one, before and I really enjoyed the experience, I really found out a lot about myself, and, um, was able to work on different skills, um, interpersonally, and just, um, so yeah, I think just continuing that self-awareness and getting to know more about myself. Getting to know how I interact with others, and, uh, is kind of what I'm looking for, this, to get out of this, group. 

00:04:25
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. Okay. So you're looking for, that, that, uh, sense of exploring self... 

00:04:30
CHALEY Mm-hmm. 

00:04:30
GROUP LEADER ...and, uh, as you listen to Amanda, and, and, Kurt talk, was there, um, anything in what they said that you could really relate to, from your own personal experience? 

00:04:45
CHALEY Um, I think what Amanda was saying about, you know, just balancing her, just different parts of her life, I feel like that's something that I deal with too, as, you know, I have a professional identity and then an identity that, with my family, and then with my friends, and different, you know, like, you just have different goals in any of these, all of these, groups. So, uh, balancing those roles, sometimes, can be difficult and, so, I think that's something that I related to what you said. 

00:05:20
GROUP LEADER Great. Yeah, and, and, that's an important part of the group process. I know in our prescreening interview I learned about each of your previous therapy experiences and many of you have had individual counseling, and one of the ways that group counseling is different is finding those connections. Sort of learning about yourself, which is your goal, your stated goal coming in, that you can do that by listening to others, and I think you just demonstrated that, so, that's a great, great step. Thank you Chaley. 

00:05:55
CAROLINE I'll go next. Um, my name is Caroline, and, uh, this is my first time ever in counseling, um, so I'm kinda nervous. Uh, and I'm here because I have had a lot of stress recently, just a whole lot on my plate, and a lot going on, and, just, um, and I'm trying to figure out how to handle that well. Cuz it just feels so overwhelming at this point, so, yeah, that's why I'm here. 

00:06:30
GROUP LEADER I saw a lot of head nods as she was talking about that stress, f-, feeling stressed. Uh, what are some areas of your life that are most stressful for you? 

00:06:40
CAROLINE Um, it's not necessarily any one thing. It's just that there's a lot of things. There's a lot of expectations. I'm currently going to school full time, working two jobs, in a serious relationship, um, trying to maintain friendships that are close, um, spend time with my family, and also, just about to start a new career, about to finish up grad school, and trying to figure out, oh my gosh, I have this job search coming up, and, what in the world, so it's just a whole lot of things in and of themself, or, I feel like I'd be able to handle, but, all at one time, it just, ugh, so much. 

00:07:20
GROUP LEADER Yeah, just that "ugh", you said, "ugh", that's, that, stress release. Sounds like you're stretched really thin. 

00:07:30
CAROLINE Oh yeah, unbelievably thin. 

00:07:30
GROUP LEADER Yeah, anyone relate to that? There's a lot of, in here (ph) evidently. Okay, good. Um, so yeah, my, my, guess is when Amanda was talking about balance, you mentioned, the, the, the, balance word, trying, to, to, spin all those plates and feeling like you can't add one more. 

00:07:50
CAROLINE Yeah, I almost don't like that word cuz it gives me something else to stress out about... 

00:07:55
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:07:55
CAROLINE ...cuz I know that I'm not balanced. 

00:08:00
GROUP LEADER Okay. 

00:08:00
CAROLINE So. 

00:08:00
GROUP LEADER So you're very aware, of... 

00:08:00
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:08:00
GROUP LEADER of, of, that? 

00:08:05
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:08:05
GROUP LEADER Okay. Well good. That's something, that, that, I think you share with a lot of your group colleagues and it's definitely something we can work on as we move forward. 'K, thanks Caroline. 

00:08:15
MALLORY I'm Mallory and I am in college trying to study to become a teacher. I'm substitute teaching and I recently got married and it's just been hard with time management trying to find out what time I have to complete everything I need for school and for work, and I've just stopped working out completely because I feel like I don't have the time, and now that I'm not exercising I feel even more stressed out, and, so, I thought maybe by joining a group I could see how other people handle the areas of their lives. 

00:08:55
GROUP LEADER Mm. Mm-Kay. So once again, that sense of juggling? 

00:09:05
MALLORY Yes, I just feel like I don't have the time to do everything that I need to get done, and, so, aspects of my life have just completely changed and I don't really know how to handle that, just like with exercising, and running, and working out I just feel like I don't have time for that and I'm just constantly stressed by school and work. 

00:09:25
GROUP LEADER Okay. So, that, that's, a, a, little bit of, a, a, different aspect, than, than, what I've heard from others, but, but, maybe, uh, they share that concern as well. It, it, seems like you have a lot of things to do and the things that get sacrificed are the things that are about you, the self-care... 

00:09:45
MALLORY Yes. 

00:09:45
GROUP LEADER ...types of issues. 

00:09:45
MALLORY Yes, and, so, then I get even more stressed out. 

00:09:50
GROUP LEADER Okay. So group can be a place for you to explore that and find out how you can move those types of things more to the forefront? 

00:10:00
MALLORY Yes. 

00:10:00
GROUP LEADER Okay. All right. Is, is, is, that the case, with, with, the people, that, that, have gone? Do you find that taking care of yourself, either takes a back seat, or do you feel like you're fairly balanced, and, and, are pretty good about making yourself a priority? Ho-, how, does that fit for you? 

00:10:20
CAROLINE It doesn't. 

00:10:20
GROUP LEADER It doesn't fit? 

00:10:25
CAROLINE No. 

00:10:25
GROUP LEADER I'm stressing you out by mentioning that. 

00:10:25
CAROLINE Yeah, I just, I think about, um, I'm a very neat and organized person but my apartment is just such a wreck whenever I get stressed out because I don't have time, um, to deal with it even though I know I feel so much more at peace when I don't come home to all of my stuff everywhere. So, I definitely get where you're coming from. 

00:10:45
MALLORY And it's good to hear someone else say that because at so many times I feel like I'm the only one. I'm the only one that is trying to balance all of the stuff in my life. Like, why me? 

00:11:00
CHALEY Ya know, a couple months ago I went to this, I don't know, this training or something, and they were talking about taking care of yourself and, I, I, was in this time in my life, I was like, you cannot tell me that right now. (crosstalk)I'm just managing to get by, like, I can only concentrate on two things in my life and everything else is falling by the wayside, and I know it's really bad but, it's like, I can't do anything about it and, its, it, feels difficult sometimes when people are like, "Oh you should be doing this." I'm like, "You don't understand, I can't." 

00:11:35
GROUP LEADER Yeah, not enough time, too overwhelmed. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:35
GROUP LEADER How 'bout for you Kurt? How does, how does that, uh, fit into, to, what you're working on, that putting yourself first? 

00:11:45
KURT Well, I guess, uh, ya know, I guess after what I, af-, after what I've gone through, um, I wasn't finding a lot of time to put myself first. Um, I was, just, just, ya know, I was kinda dealing with too many issues at the same time. I was dealing with a lot of stress like some of these people too, but it was just from different, it stemmed from a different thing. 

00:12:10
GROUP LEADER Sure. 

00:12:10
KURT Um, and, now, well right as, ya know, right now, I'm trying to find time where ya know, I can, I'm trying to get my things together right now, trying to, ya know, build relationships which I'm having problems with, and, ya know, it kinda goes back to the trust thing, ya know, and, it's, a, ya know, the stress, and, and, what I've gone through and it just hurt my relationships, and, and, uh, just, I'm, tryin' to get that back together right now. 

00:12:40
GROUP LEADER Okay. 

00:12:40
KURT So. 

00:12:40
GROUP LEADER And, and, I think the attempt to connect is a recognition and a demonstration of you putting yourself... 

00:12:45
KURT Yeah 

00:12:50
GROUP LEADER Uh, out there, and first, which is, a good thing. 

00:12:55
KURT Yeah. 

00:12:55
GROUP LEADER Yeah, I'll throw something out there, and obviously we're not connected enough, uh, maybe, to really experience this yet, but it's my hope that we will, that coming to group, and participating in group is an example of "you" time. That, that, you carving out this hour and a half to come in, talk about what is, uh, important to you, listening to other people, uh, is a, great example of putting yourself first. Now, one of the things we're going to have to watch is that you get the time to get your stuff out there, that you don't feel like, "Oh, I've got all these other people to help and their issues are more important." Uh, so that each of us take that challenge to carve out some time, not only see this as a demonstration, of, of, me time, but to take some time in here and, to, to, get your voice heard. Okay? How 'bout you? 

00:13:55
GREG Um, my name's Greg, and, uh, I'm a rookie at this, uh, this is my first time, uh, in any kind of counseling, uh, an-, an-, and, I heard about this and then thought I'd, I, kinda take a chance and come, cuz, cuz, I, I, just wanna kinda get a dialogue going and talk a little bit myself about, uh, it just feels funny sharing this, about, uh, ya know, bein' a black man in a white world, and, uh, ya-, just navigating that, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's, ya, it's, it's, it's, just kind of a real heightened awareness, of, of, of, of, difference, and, uh, thought about this a lot in terms of, uh, com-, coming, to a group like this, and, uh, uh, thought, ya know, what the heck, I kinda, would love to, ya know, just kinda, learn more about that, and be able to, maybe, the word that comes to me is, vent a little bit about that. So, so, that's, that's, kinda where I'm at, (crosstalk) kinda where I'm at. Yeah. 

00:14:50
GROUP LEADER Okay. So part of that experience is feeling different, feeling outside? 

00:15:00
GREG Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, very much, yeah, very much feeling different. 

00:15:05
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:15:05
GREG Yeah. I heard, uh, ya, I heard somethin' earlier, uh, that kinda resonated with me but from a, different, different, aspect. Uh, when you had to talk about roles, uh, but, I feel often that I'm balancing different roles as I interact, and, uh, ya know, and that's the, that's, that's, that's, kinda, kinda, different but the roles aren't professional and personal, well, it very personal, they're how you interact with, uh, ya, when you're, you're, in mixed racial company, uh, uh, how, how you, how you, gonna interact in, a, ya know, common, racial company, it's, it's, it's, kind of a weird thing, so, yeah, anyway. That's kinda where I'm at, ya know, and I just kinda throw that out for what it's worth. 

00:15:50
GROUP LEADER Okay. My, my, uh, guess is what you wanna do here, li-, ya know, listening to you, is that you wanted to start a dialogue, you wanted to start a conversation. 

00:16:00
GREG Yeah, yeah. 

00:16:00
GROUP LEADER Uh, if you start that conversation, wha-, what are you hoping to learn or gain from that? Wha-, what's the best outcome? 

00:16:10
GREG Uh, for, for, me to, coup-, a couple of things that kind of hit me. Uh, one, uh, just a value add for me to be able to express some of what I feel, uh, that's a big, that's a, that's a, big outcome that I know I'd, I, feel, feel, a little isolated, (inaudible )and I guess from that, uh, being able to learn a little bit more through that expression, being able to learn a little bit more about the, just the whole dynamic, (crosstalk)uh, so, that's what hits me when you ask me that question. 

00:16:40
GROUP LEADER Okay. Yeah, tha-, tha-, that, makes a lot of sense and... 

00:16:40
GREG It's kinda personal, I just threw it out there, and again, this is my first time even dealing with any kind of counseling or anything of that sort. (ph)It'll be, be interesting, yeah. 

00:16:50
GROUP LEADER Yeah. Well, I, I, appreciate the risk, uh, that, that, you're willing to take and use this group as a place to try to establish that dialogue... 

00:16:55
GREG Mm. 

00:16:55
GROUP LEADER I'm also aware, that, that, that, we don't know each other yet, so this may not feel like a real safe place, and I guess, it's, it's, the commitment of the group, uh, really to work on any issue that you stated requires a risk, requires each person to really try to make that a safe place. Um, and then your part of, the, the, contract is to get out there too. 

00:17:25
GREG Mm-hmm. 

00:17:25
GROUP LEADER Right? To, to, be able to state, uh, and contribute to the safety so that you can get to a place and we can all get to a place to have that dialogue, and so I'm looking forward to that. 

00:17:40
GREG Cool. 

00:17:40
GROUP LEADER Yeah. Okay. Well, today we came in as strangers and I think we did some really good work today because, as I mentioned, the primary goal, you know, wasn't to fix everybody's problems and get everything tied up, we have the rest of the, the, life of the group to, to, explore in a deeper way. The purpose of today was just to sorta break the ice a little bit, to get out there in the water and start the journey of getting to know one another. So, we came in today knowing nothing about each other and to know that we had success will be that if you've learned something about each person. So, I've got something I, I, I, want you to do, as a way to wrap up this first group. What I want you to do is take some time to make eye contact with each member of the group, and as you do that, I want you to think about the thing that you now know about them that you didn't know when group began. Okay? So just take a moment to do that. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:19:10
GROUP LEADER The segment you just watched was a good example of a first group experience. It's the first time that the group members are coming together and getting to know one another. When I'm teaching about the first stage of a group, I tell my students to think about a first date experience. What is a first date like? Well, it's awkward and everybody is anxious, and that's normal because you don't know the people. You're just getting a feel for what's going on, there's a lot of assessment going on. How do I fit into this relationship, and will the, p-, other people, uh, like me? So, that's exactly what's going on in this particular group. For a leader, it's a good idea to understand that, that, is very normal in any group experience and not expect them to go too deep, too soon. It's just not safe enough to disclose real meaningful aspects of yourself. As such, as a leader, what you want to do is prepare opportunities for your group to connect on superficial levels, which is exactly what they're going to be trying to do at that given time. In this particular group, I went with the standard, "What is it that you expect out of group?" as well as giving them an opportunity to say their names. That's a very superficial way for people to start to learn something about themselves, participate in the group and begin that connection process. As you noticed, each group member felt fairly comfortable talking a little bit about themselves. The role of the leader as they do that is to either reflect, that helps with the members feeling understood about what their, what it is, that they're saying. As well as connecting members when possible, to possible, thi-, themes, that are going on, and that's exactly what was happening in this group. Towards the end of the group I gave them an experience where it allowed them to connect. I chose looking into ea-, to the eyes of the particular members as a way to focus them and think about what it is that they learned. As I mentioned earlier, it's very normal for everything to be not very deep at this stage of the group. You don't want your group members leaving, thinking, "Hey, that was no big deal, all we did was sit around and talk about fairly meaningless things." So that idea, that it was completely normal to be talking, at this level, was very important for the group experience at this stage of development. What I was trying to do is set the stage for the further development of the group. As the group gets more comfortable connecting at these levels, they will begin to risk a little bit more, which means they'll begin to disclose more meaningful aspects of themselves and develop a sense of trust. As we move into the next segment what you'll also notice is as that trust forms, it'll become less about the external pieces of the group and more about the here and now experiences and the interpersonal awareness that is occurring in the group.

Moving from External to Here and Now Processing 

00:22:35
CAROLINE Um, I have something I, I, really wanted to talk about today. Um, so, last time I mentioned that I just really struggle with a lot of stress, an-, and it got really bad this week. Um, just with things piling up, um, and, and, I did what I always do and that's just, I freeze, I just feel so paralyzed when, um, when everything builds up and, so, it's like, I can't do anything about it, so I can't do anything to help me get out of that stress and it just kind of makes it build up more and more and more and all I feel like I can do is sit on my couch and do nothing, and, and, so then, you know, since I just feel so stuck, of course I feel guilty because I didn't get all this stuff done, and, and when I try to start getting it done the perfectionist in me is like, "Oh, well, now you have just a few hours left to get it done. You're never gonna get it done the way you want to and so it, just, spirals and, I just, so, struggled with that this week. 

00:23:35
GROUP LEADER Mm. So you have that issue of stress and, you're, you're giving us an indication of what you do with that stress, or what, and what it does to you. 

00:23:45
CAROLINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:23:45
GROUP LEADER Which it paralyzes you... 

00:23:45
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:23:45
GROUP LEADER ...it, it causes that stuck feeling 

00:23:50
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:23:50
GROUP LEADER Yeah. I noticed, I, I, I sensed some, like, you really related to that, in, in some way. Would you like talk about that a little bit to Caroline? 

00:24:00
MALLORY Well, I kinda feel like she does but I don't really feel that I get stuck and paralyzed, I feel like, I'll go home and start working on a lot of homework for school or think about work stuff, and I can't really focus on one thing at one time. I'll be doing one thing but I'm thinking about another thing so I'm really not being productive and really, in the long run, getting anything done. 

00:24:25
GROUP LEADER Okay. All right, and, and that sounds like a little bit, of, of a stuck feeling, uh... 

00:24:30
MALLORY Right. 

00:24:30
GROUP LEADER ...because you're so scattered... 

00:24:35
MALLORY Yeah, I guess it could be. 

00:24:35
GROUP LEADER Yeah. Okay. All right. Are there other ways, that, that you relate to that? 

00:24:45
 It sounds a lot like, I, I feel like I was in that stage about two years ago where, just, like, everything was too much and there was nothing I could stop cuz if I stopped anything then it would make everything else harder, and, I mean, I can even tell, like, sort of, in the cadence of my voice, like, it matches that, which is not really how I talk anymore, and so, like, I don't wanna, like, advise give, um, but I definitely have identified with that in the past and for me what I experienced was when I was doing that I was trying to get a lot done but I ended up not being good at anything I was doing because it was just too much, and, so, um, I mean it was a hard season of, like, cutting things out, but I ultimately, I was really afraid to, like, stop doing anything cuz, I just, it didn't seem like there was anything that I could cut out but I just did and then it, I don't know how to say it, like, it solved, not it solved the problem, but there was so much more peace at doing fewer things but feeling like I was actually good at what I was doing, and so... 

00:25:55
CAROLINE But everything just feels so crucial. I mean, ya know, I can't, I work to pay for school, I work to pay the bills, so that's non-negotiable. School's kind of a non-negotiable, um, I need to graduate so that I can get a job in my field, um, what am I gonna say, like, "Okay, boyfriend, sorry, can't see you for a week." When he's a huge source of support in my life. So, it just feels like absolutely nothing can give, and so, I don't know what to take out to give myself some space and, yeah, it just feels stuck. 

00:26:30
GROUP LEADER Really difficult to prioritize... 

00:26:35
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:26:35
GROUP LEADER ...and choose... 

00:26:35
CAROLINE When everything feels so important. 

00:26:35
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. Yeah. Th-, that, that is tough, y'know, one of the things, that, that I think about, is, as I'm listening to you, is, how that dynamic is going to look in group, and so, when I was listening to you, one of the things, that, that I heard you say is that, when, you have a hard time choosing and things build up and you start to feel overwhelmed and you become paralyzed, and, when I'm thinking about my filter of what that looks like in group, I'm, I'm wondering if there's going to come a time where you feel so overwhelmed that you may choose to just stay on your couch and not come to group. 

00:27:25
CAROLINE Yeah. I will definitely say the thought crossed my mind. 

00:27:30
GROUP LEADER Yeah. (crosstalk)Because, this, this does represent just sort of another... 

00:27:35
CAROLINE Mm-hmm. 

00:27:35
GROUP LEADER ...uh, another plate, in, in your plate spinning competition that you have going on. Yeah. 

00:27:40
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:27:40
GROUP LEADER Well, for, for me, ya know, uh, as we discussed before, being here is really crucial, and so, as a way, to, to foreshadow for you, just, and each of you can do this as you're struggling with your own issues and becoming aware, you can think about, just like I said, what is this gonna look like in group, and see that as a way to work on that issue. So, it will be vital for you, when you feel that paralysis, that this will be an opportunity for growth, to come in here, and instead of acting out the paralysis at home, and, and becoming more stressed, that you fight that and do something different and come in and hear, and talk about it. 

00:28:25
CAROLINE 'Kay. 

00:28:25
GROUP LEADER Yeah. 

00:28:25
MALLORY I kind of felt that same way. When I was getting ready to come to group, I saw all the laundry piled up by my door when I was walking out and I thought, "Oh, I could stay here and get all my laundry done instead of coming to group." 

00:28:40
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm, yeah. I see some head nods. I mean, we talked a lot about stress and prioritizing, and, and doing those types of things in, our, our lives, so, so, uh, why come to group? Like, why, what, what made ya look past the laundry and say, "I, I'm gonna come today."? 

00:29:00
MALLORY Because, once again, I felt like I was the only one that has laundry to do, and homework, and dishes, and spend time with my husband, and focus on work, and I knew that there were other people in the group feeling the same way, so I could get rid of that feeling if I came to group. 

00:29:20
GROUP LEADER Mm. Okay. 

00:29:20
CHALEY I think, um, an issue I've been having is, like, with my roommates, they don't understand that I have all of these things going on and I can't get my laundry done and I can't get, um, everything done that they want done at a certain time, and I just feel like I'm letting everyone else down in my life, and I, uh, it's just like, really difficult because I feel like I can't please everyone and I'm just letting everyone else down and there's, like, a million things that need to be done but I can't get around to all of them and I'm just doing the most important things, I'm like, "I'll get to that later." And, it, yeah, it gets hard to, like, want to do something else, extra. 

00:30:10
GROUP LEADER Mm. Okay. Well, it sounds like for you, you are prioritizing but then you feel guilty about not being able to attend to everything, not being able to attend to everyone. 

00:30:20
CHALEY Yeah. I, well, I feel guilty about the prioritizing, like, what makes this so, mu-, so important? Like, I mean, I have, like I sa-, I have to, pay for school, and I have to pay, you know, for my living expenses, like, I feel like that's very important, and like, you know, I'm paying for this schooling so I need to, like, actually do it, so, I have to, like, do my homework and then everything else kind of, like, "Well, I, I, told my friend that I'd email her this." Or "I told my roommate that I'd take care of this." And, I, I feel guilty all the time cuz I cannot ever...and, maybe they don't feel that way but I feel that way because, I'm like, I feel like I'm letting them down, and it, I think I experience that, like, I'll hear their little quips behind my back or, like, their, the quips that they'll say, like, "Oh, well, don't ask her to do that." Or "I just did it for you." Like, "Because I knew you were really busy." But what I hear is, "Because I know you can't get it done." And so, it's like really frustrating sometime. 

00:31:35
GROUP LEADER Yeah. How 'bout that analysis that I talked about, where, where, y-, where you think about what that's gonna look like in group? How do you think that's gonna appear in group? 

00:31:50
CHALEY Um, that I, alw-, I guess, like, that I feel like I might need to attend to, like, all these different people, and that I'll just feel guilty for not, helpi- , like, helping them or that I'm, like, focusing too much on one person or something like that, or on myself, like spending too much time in the group on myself and, like, feeling guilty, like, "Oh, I should, I should be doing something else, or something like that maybe. 

00:32:15
GROUP LEADER So it sounds like you're really up in, your, your head, that, that may be, one, one impact that it'll have on, m-, on the group, that instead of just experiencing the group and relating to other people, you're actually processing and trying to prioritize and second guessing yourself, and... 

00:32:30
CHALEY Mm-hmm, and even, maybe, se-, second guessing what somebody says to me, because I'm like, "Well, what's the meaning behind that?" and "Did they really mean what they just said." Or did they mean that, like, "oh". I don't know, just, like, trying to filter what it means whenever someone says anything. It's kind of hard. 

00:32:55
GROUP LEADER Yeah, yeah. Anybody else have that, e-, experience, or, or, ah, I guess, anxiety about group, now that we're getting to know each other and getting a little deeper that you find yourself being up in your head, and, and doing the same type, of, of mental calculation that Chaley talked about? What's goin' on inside your head as we're processing? 

00:33:20
GREG I'm still a little nervous. Uh, uh, we'll, s-, uh, uh, in, in my head as I think about, uh, interactions, etcetera, still kind of, uh, kind of aware, of, of, of risk taking, uh, aspect of a, of, of, of my journey. Uh, and, uh, I guess from what I've heard, one of the things that resonates with me is, the, the, the second guessing that I heard is, uh, as, uh, Chaley talked that, uh, I can relate to some of that. Uh, wow, I, I, uh, for, for what it's worth department, (ph) uh, being stuck, and that's the word that you used, I just, it just tugged at me to hear that. Uh, just that word, just how you said it, just, really, really, really tugged at me. Ya know, so, I guess that's what I, some of the things that I thought as we, went, went around and, uh, interacted about that. (ph)Yeah, anyway. 

00:34:20
GROUP LEADER Yeah, the second guessing, the feeling, um, anxiety, about connecting, and, and what these relationships mean. Kurt, I know you had talked initially, about, about trust and, that, that's a, definitely a core issue, of, of what we're talking about here. 

00:34:40
KURT It sure is. Uh, I'll admit, I'm a little bit anxious about, just, you know, with some of the dialogue, you know, between people right now, just, I'm, uh, just, I'm not sure exactly how to make a relationship work in group yet. Um, but, you know, maybe, through, through some dialogue and as I get more comfortable I'll begin to, uh, warm up, ya know, some, uh, a, what would yous call it, uh, a, some rapport with some of the, uh, the group members here. So...and we'll go from there. 

00:35:20
GROUP LEADER An-, and I think, I think, uh, not to sound too counselorly, but, this is exactly where we need to be. I mean, wouldn't it be unreal if, you know, in the beginning of group, on-, once we go through our names, and everything's...suddenly, we just trust everybody, and, we-, we're able to get , real, real, you know, automatically? Um, I think, I think what we're struggling with, whether, it's, it's stress from priorities, or, at the core, is really about relationships and about making those decisions and, what, what that does to us, and, and that all develops, and what we're doing is developing, and so where we are right now is completely normal, it's feeling a little anxious, feeling a little bit closer, but there's a new type of anxiety that comes from getting closer, and that's almost, where, where we are. 

00:36:10
GREG Mm. 

00:36:10
GROUP LEADER Um, and I guess my encouragement to you is, uh, each one of you is in that stage where you have the desire to connect more, but you're thinking about it a lot, and group can be a great place, a laboratory, to practice getting out there. Experiencing, doing, verbalizing what's in your head and, let it, let us work with it, and that's how these relationships are going to form. So as we move forward, um, I hope there's a sense of comfort in the room that we begin to do that. That as things come up in our brains, instead of silencing them, we start to get those out a little bit more. How does that sound? 

00:36:55
KURT That sounds good. 

00:36:55
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:37:00
AMANDA It produces a new anxiety in me... 

00:37:00
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:37:00
AMANDA I wasn't anxious until you said that. 

00:37:00
GROUP LEADER Okay, great, uh, I did my job. Yeah, the, the, the thing is now is that should create a new anxiety because it's a risk. That's what we're talking about in here, risk, risk to do something new, risk to get out there and work instead of keeping it all inside. 

00:37:20
CHALEY I think when you said that I was thinking about taking a risk and asking Greg what he meant by his second guessing, cuz I have a perception of my second guessing but you said that you feel that way too, and, I don't know, just to hear somebody else's thoughts on that. 

00:37:40
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:37:40
GREG I guess, uh, I guess the way I, I guess the way I would answer that, uh, is, um, when you said, when you said that you wonder what's, behin-, what's, real-, is there any other meaning behind what, wha-, what was said, etcetera, uh, that kind of resonated with me when you said that, uh, I, I feel, that, that, that I've been gifted, th-, I've been, gi-, gifted with great, th-, th-, the metaphor I use is, antenna. I have great antenna. I, I, I, I, I know that. I feel that, and, uh, I can just pick up sometimes, uh, ener-, just, just, just, wha-, wha-, what's the energy of our communication, what's really goin' on here. Often, my antenna will pick up something different than what's going on in the surface. Uh, and yeah, sometimes, I'll, I'll think maybe that's me, but as we go on I'll get some other affirming things, cause it's kinda, hi-, hard to hide that, that said, "Yeah, that's right. She's not comfortable." 

00:38:45
CHALEY Mm-hmm. 

00:38:45
GREG For whatever reason, and you wonder, "What's up with that?" You know? Uh, or, he's, he's kinda weird with me and not normal, uh, wha-, what's up with that, so that's kinda the second guessing, and, uh, and, and, and, it's, it's, its, and, and for me, it's, it's al-, it's very particular, in a, in a, uh, kind of interracial thing, and it gets old after a while, trying' to process that stuff, ya know? Anyway, so... 

00:39:15
CHALEY Mm. Yeah. 

00:39:15
GROUP LEADER That answer your question? Did it help you clarify and... 

00:39:20
CHALEY Yeah. 

00:39:20
GROUP LEADER ...you feel like you understand him a little bit better? 

00:39:25
CHALEY Mm.hmm. 

00:39:25
GROUP LEADER Yeah, and my guess, and, and correct me if I'm wrong for both of you, and, and I think we all second guess to some degree but for both of, both of you, that when you pick up those things, it, it's not always safe to clarify with that other person. To say, "Hey, I pick, I'm pickin' up something a little bit different, can you, can you tell... 

00:39:45
GREG Oh wow, that...(ph) 

00:39:45
GROUP LEADER ... me what's under the surface?" Right? 

00:39:45
GREG Yeah, not only for me, not only is it not always safe but it's kinda irritating because I will often, not, clarify with that other person. So that becomes an internal dialogue for me, that I've gotta step through and all of the, uh, uh, ya know, the self-questioning goes to it that, and you get, you wonder, you wonder, are you right, are you wrong, what's up, y'know, again, what's, what's goin' on? 

00:40:10
GROUP LEADER Lots of questioning... 

00:40:10
GREG Lots of (crosstalk)second guessing. (ph) 

00:40:10
GROUP LEADER ...confusion, (crosstalk)yeah, it's probably very similar to that. (ph)Well, I hope as we move forward that group becomes a safe place where you can clarify, where as your antenna are picking up those types of things in the group, that you're able to say, "Hey, I wanna know, wh-, what's goin' on with that." You (ph)tell me a little bit more, and do that exploration. 

00:40:35
GREG Hmm. 

00:40:35
GROUP LEADER Because, the, the worst thing to happen would be that you would just replicate what happens on the outside, and that, is, all stays in here. That we're able to say what we're thinking, and say, uh, give language to the unspoken questions that we have about relationships in here, as we move forward. 

00:40:55
GROUP LEADER As the group members become more comfortable with the processing in group, each member starts to develop a sense of trust and safety, which allows them to talk about more meaningful aspects of themselves. The group leader should be prepared to facilitate this, and one of the primary ways that we do that, is that we start to transition the group members discussion from external relationships to more direct experiencing within the group. Now this can be very tricky because the group members will feel the shift and feel like it's more intense so they may resist in some ways, and it's also easier, often times, for group leaders to ignore that all together and expect that the, tra-, transition will happen on its own. It often will not happen on its own and requires a lot of effort on the part of the group leader to make that transition. One of the ways to do this, that's demonstrated in the segment, is the filter that I use. Whenever I'm listening, from the very first group to group members discussing their external relationships, I think to myself, "What is this interpersonal dynamic going to look like in group?" In the case of Caroline, Caroline is talking at length about her life, and how she feels overwhelmed and she has all these duties that she has to keep up with. The way that she responds to that is she often times feels paralyzed. I think the comment that she make is, "Sometimes I just drop everything and sit on the couch." Using my filter, I'm thinking, "Okay, what is this going to look like in group?" Now, I could have hypothesized what that's going to look like in group and maybe saved it or even verbalized it in group, but instead what I did is I went ahead and I put that out to the group and asked Caroline specifically, "I'm wondering what that's going to look like in group?" Now, Caroline was able to take that and gain a little insight and then give back to the group that she thought that, well, there may be times when she fills so overwhelmed that she may prioritize other things above group, which would mean that she would not come to group. Now, this is a great thing to work at because, not only does it help Caroline gain some awareness of how her inner personal dynamics work, but I'm also able to bring it into the group. It's an extra bonus that I'm able, by working on it, I'm able to bypass a potentially very critical dynamic that may hurt the group, that is, Caroline might not come back, and so by working with that, Caroline's able to see that her paralysis might actually impact the group, and then, that enables me to encourage her, that should she start to feel overwhelmed, that instead of sitting on the couch, no matter how badly she wants to that she go ahead and come to group and then talk about it in group, which she seems willing to do. That's just a really good example of how someone was talking about an external issue and I was able, as, as a group leader, to listen to that, think about how it's gonna impact group and bring those inner personal dynamics into the heart of the group. Work at this stage is going to continue at this pace. For a while, it's going to be me hearing those themes, thinking of their dynamics in such a way and then trying to facilitate each member seeing it as happening within the group. If I'm successful at doing that, then the group members will get on board, and they'll begin to also process their external dynamics, uh, as an in-group experience and it will take much of the work load off me. What we can expect in the future is a greater intensity to the work as group members begin to come into group and they shed their external lies but they keep who they are. So they're able to talk about who they are and how they relate to people by using the individuals in the group, instead of talking about people in their lives.

Managing Conflict 

00:45:20
GROUP LEADER Okay, well welcome back everybody, uh, this is our, f-, fifth group session, uh, that we've had and I think that we've made a lot of progress, but, before we start, uh, with, our, our usual getting into it, uh, that we've been doing for the past couple of weeks, I just wanted to bring something up. I, I, I was reflecting on the work, that, that we've done and, I, I think we, as a group, have progressed quite a bit, uh, from the first time that we met. Starting to identify some themes and really begin to work with one another and addressing that desire for connection, but fear of connection, at, at, the same time, that I think relates to just about everybody's individual goal. It's now become a group goal. But as I was reflecting, I, I couldn't help but sense that, ahh, a sense of being stuck. Um, and I don't know if that's a reflection, of the, of the theme that we've been talking about, ya know? Many of you have said when we just get overwhelmed we get to that stuck place. So, I'm sure that has a bit to do with it but, I'm, I'm also feeling like a part of it, has, has to do with, of, where, where we are and where we're going as a group. I don't really even know how to fix that, um, or even to say anything more than that, just, I just wanted to express that feeling, throw that out to the group and, and, and see if you had any feedback or, um, uh, you know, about that group stuck-ness. 

00:46:50
MALLORY Well, I kinda feel stuck because I'm still so stressed out at home and with my roles now, with being a college student, and work, and wife, I just feel like my husband does not understand and I kinda feel, you, as a male Group Leader, don't understand the roles of a wife, because I go to school, at night, I get home late, and then there's dishes to do, there's laundry to do, and I just feel like I have to do all of it, and I kinda feel like you don't understand that, just being a male in my relationship with the male female roles. 

00:47:25
GROUP LEADER Okay, all right. So, so, you're experiencing that, in, in your own relationship and you're also experiencing that with me? 

00:47:30
MALLORY Right. I just kind feel like you don't understand all the roles that I have to take on, so it's getting really hard trying to convey to you what all I need to balance, and try to figure out how to balance all of the roles, where I don't feel so stuck and stressed. 

00:47:50
GROUP LEADER Yeah, and, I, I sense that there's actually something even deeper there that it's not just about understanding all of the different things that you have to do but maybe something, I don't know, more, about, about what that means to you, uh, as a person, as a woman, uh, with all of those things to do. 

00:48:10
MALLORY Right, like, I feel like I should be the one who does all the dishes, and does all the laundry, and cleans the house because I feel like that is the wife's role, but then sometimes I feel like maybe my husband is telling me that he'll do it, kind of like Chaley was saying, that he'll do the dishes and do the laundry, but then I kind of hear him saying, oh, that maybe it's because I can't do it, so then I feel like, he doesn't understand the roles of the wife and, just, with being a male, how I feel like there's so many more pressures on women of balancing so many roles, and sometimes I feel like you won't ever be able to understand that. 

00:49:00
GROUP LEADER Okay. So, there's a, there's a difference between us that you're concerned about... 

00:49:05
MALLORY Yes. 

00:49:05
GROUP LEADER ...you-,You're really wanting me to get that... 

00:49:10
MALLORY Mm-hmm. 

00:49:10
GROUP LEADER ...and concerned that I'm not. 

00:49:10
MALLORY Yeah. 

00:49:10
GREG Yeah, I feel the same thing with all candor, I really do, I really do. Uh, I mean, you, you, you, even when you talked just now you talked about the things we talked about, of feeling overwhelmed, etcetera, uh, yeah, I haven't talked about that... 

00:49:25
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:49:30
GREG ...Uh, I've been talking about feeling different. You didn't even acknowledge that. You didn't even acknowledge that. Uh, I feel, ya, I mean, I, I, I'm a little uncomfortable feeling so animated but, it, it, that's just what hit me is I heard you talk. 

00:49:45
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:49:45
GREG Uh, I, I don't know that you, I, I, I, I s-, I s-, since you asked, I sometimes feel that you're hearing me, but then sometimes I feel as if you hear them a lot better than you hear me. 

00:49:55
GROUP LEADER Okay. 

00:50:00
GREG I really do. So, you asked, now you know. 

00:50:00
GROUP LEADER I did. Yeah, and, I, I, I first appreciate, that, that you said that because one of the things that we specifically talked about was that you have that antenna... 

00:50:10
GREG Mm-hmm. 

00:50:10
GROUP LEADER ...and my feeling is that you were picking up something under the surface with me and that you've been doing a lot of thinking about it and one of the things that we discussed is you, uh, taking the risk to clarify.... 

00:50:20
GREG Well, I appreciate, (crosstalk)I appreciate hearing that from you... 

00:50:20
GROUP LEADER ...(crosstalk)and sort of wondering what's going on. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:50:25
GREG I appreciate hearing that from you. 

00:50:25
GROUP LEADER Okay, and, uh, ya know, you saying something, is, is, is the start of that dialogue and I guess what I heard you say is that it's very important for you, for me, and the rest of the group to know, um, that it's painful for you to feel different. 

00:50:45
GREG Yeah. Yeah it is, it, it, is, yeah it is. It's just uncomfortable, and even more importantly I guess, I was sharing with you, uh, it's, it's, it's irritating to feel ignored, that it's irritating to feel ignored. Uh, and I'm not stupid, uh, maybe, maybe, maybe some of that's me. 

00:51:00
GROUP LEADER Mm. 

00:51:05
GREG Maybe some of that's me, but you talked about throwing that stuff out in the group, so, uh, that's what I felt... 

00:51:10
GROUP LEADER Yeah. 

00:51:10
GREG ...when you say, you know, ya know, I, maybe that's why I'm a little stuck, in terms of what we said in group before... 

00:51:15
GROUP LEADER Yeah. 

00:51:15
GREG Yeah. 

00:51:15
GROUP LEADER Yeah, and, and, and that makes sense to me, not, not feeling like someone understands you. Not feeling like you're being heard, um, is, is something that can lead people to not want to take the next step or take the risk because, as we discussed, it doesn't feel safe right? I mean, if I don't get where you're coming from, if I don't understand, at a very core level, uh, then it's not gonna feel safe to take the next step. 

00:51:40
GREG Right. 

00:51:40
GROUP LEADER Yeah. 

00:51:40
GREG Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:51:45
GROUP LEADER Okay. How 'bout, how 'bout, other, other people in the room about, because, that, that's really what, I think that's where I was feeling that stuck-ness, and wanting to take that next step, which is a greater risk. 

00:51:55
GREG Hmm. Wow. 

00:51:55
GROUP LEADER Um, other, other people's, sort of feeling about that? 

00:52:00
AMANDA Well, I wanted to respond to what Greg was saying, um, because I haven't disclosed in group, but I'm biracial and so I have a lot of feelings, not so much in this group, but just in everyday life of feeling very, that conflict, and, and, feeling not as understood or not listened to, um, and so I identify with that same frustration and, I, I came here to work on more the professional, and, and home life balance, but, I, I have that, not that same, but a similar, uh, identifying issue of being, like, "Well, am I really understood?" Am I really heard or if I am different is that [00:52:50 being blamed on my race, and, um, I just think that's, that it's even harder if you feel unheard by someone you expect to hear you, like your counselor, or your group leader, and so, um, I just wanted, to, to share in that, that I think, that, that is just a, really, it's a real experience and it, it, it can hurt even more. I know a lot, when I, when I've gone to someone that I expected to really listen to me and to really hear me and I feel like they're just kind of somewhere else and have their own ideas of what's going on. It's, like, so much more hurtful...so. 

00:53:30
[sil.] 

00:53:35
GROUP LEADER How was that for you, to, to hear what Amanda had to say? 

00:53:40
GREG I really appreciate hearing it. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I, I, I really appreciated hearing that, for what it's worth, uh, yeah, I, I, yeah, I appreciate that. I appreciate that. 

00:53:50
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. Other thoughts, or experiences about taking that next step, feeling stuck, or, even, even what's gone on today, with, with, um, I think so of the risking, that, that has happened in here? 

00:54:10
CAROLINE Honestly, it just, these conversations make me so uncomfortable. Um, and it makes me wanna take several steps back, um, but then when I really think about it, seeing, you know, like, you guys were taking a really big risk talking about that, and... so I don't know, it's, just, kind of anxiety provoking but at the same time, like, I really, um, value and respect the fact that you can be so open about things that are so personal to your experience, when, you know, you barely know me, and ya know, I don't know you that well and, yeah. 

00:54:50
GROUP LEADER Mm. I think that's one of the things that risk feels like, is it feels anxiety provoking. Ya know, my guess is that, as each of you shared, uh, today, before you decided, to, to speak, and, and say, uh, that, uh, and disclose that to me that you felt that anxiety inside, and Greg, as you were relating, to, to what Mallory had to say, the, once again, the courage that it took, to, to actually say something, not keep it in your head, to say out, that, that's what risk feels like. 

00:55:25
GREG Yeah, there's no doubt about that. It, it's kinda funny cuz, I, I, I was kind of irritated, with all candor, when we talked about it. 

00:55:30
GROUP LEADER Don't...(ph) 

00:55:30
GREG I feel a little better about that a little bit, to let it out, (ph)for what it's worth. 

00:55:40
GROUP LEADER Well , I'll, I'll, I'll ask, the, the two of you, and, and really anybody, can, can chime in because y'know, (ph)we, we, as a group, are all part of the stuck feeling. Ya know, we're all contributing to it and will contribute to the movement, in, in some way. But, ya know, thinking about that lack of understanding, um, what is it that you think you would need from the group or from me, but probably better from the group, uh, to, to move forward? What would help you increase that feeling of being understood? 

00:56:15
MALLORY Well, I think just the piece of self-care, like you mentioned in one of our earlier sessions, how, just learning how to [00:56:25 ]be more self -aware, and self-care of yourself and not really the other roles and balance that go along with that until you really know yourself, and how I'm interacting with other people, through other relationships. 

00:56:40
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. Okay. So maybe giving, um, you time in group to really share that and explore it would be helpful to you? 

00:56:50
MALLORY Yes. That would help a lot, just to become more self-aware of myself, how I can increase my self-awareness, along with self-care, before trying to take on all of these other roles and how people see my roles. 

00:57:05
GROUP LEADER Mm. Yeah. Okay. How 'bout for you Greg? 

00:57:10
GREG Well, it's , it's, it's funny because, uh, just, the personal risk taking, kind of, kind of helped a lot, for what it's worth. Uh, and, uh, this feeling like, you, you're not just as different as you think you are, uh, kind of, kinda helped out a lot, so, uh, that, that was, that was good. I'll leave that at that, so, yeah, that, that helps in the group, knowing that, you're, you're, you're, you're heard and see where that goes. 

00:57:45
GROUP LEADER Yeah. 

00:57:45
KURT I think it takes a lot of courage to take a risk like some of you have done, um, and that's a hard thing to do, and, uh, ya know, that, that's something I'm trying to work on too. Uh, ya know, building some courage up, taking some risks, and hopefully in return, ya know, uh, you build relationships that way, and, and, uh, and that's, that's kinda what I'm thinking right now, so. 

00:58:20
GROUP LEADER Yeah, I, I, I, I guess for me, going along with, what, what Kurt said, I, is we have to be willing to take that risk, to, to get the payoff that we're looking for and in our relationships. 

00:58:30
GREG I hear you. That's a good point. 

00:58:35
GROUP LEADER Yeah, and I think, that's, that's really what we did today and, it's, it's, um, when you're looking for understanding and you're concerned and afraid that you're not being understood, there's no way, that, that we're gonna be able to wrap it up. There's nothing that I can say that will automatically make you go, "Oh, he gets me now." Or, for you to say, "Wow, that man knows what it's like to be me, as a woman." There's just nothing I can say. But, I, what, what I think we've done as a group today, is not only acknowledge the risk that it too, which is important, that's an important part of understanding, but I know I'm committed, uh, to being willing to being open to learn, and, to, to share in that dialogue that you're looking for, and I think that at the end of the journey maybe we'll be closer to understanding than we were before. 

00:59:25
GREG Hmm. 

00:59:30
GROUP LEADER Is that something that, as a group, feels, feels good, like a commitment to a willingness, to, to go together, in, into that next step? 

00:59:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:59:40
CHALEY It's kind of scary to be that open with people, but, I mean, you guys were really brave today, and, I mean, I think the words that I think are, "I'm proud" of you guys because, like, you were the first ones to step out and say something, so... 

00:59:55
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

00:59:55
GREG Hmm. 

00:59:55
CHALEY ...like, models for the rest of us. 

01:00:00
GREG Yeah. Thanks. 

01:00:00
MALLORY Well, thank you for saying that because it makes me feel a lot better, because I do have trouble taking risk and letting people know how I feel, and I think that's where I got in this stuck position in the first place. 

01:00:15
CHALEY Mm. 

01:00:15
GREG Me too. Thanks. 

01:00:20
GROUP LEADER Well, good. So, moving forward, that's, this is something that we can build on. Uh, we've had quite a few members, sort of, jump in and take that plunge and test out the waters, and, ya know, everything isn't rainbows and flowers. We're still people struggling to understand one another, um, but hopefully, that, that struggle looks safer than it did before. Okay? All right, I will see you next week. 

01:00:50
GROUP LEADER In this segment, the group got its first experience with conflict. Conflict can be very scary for group members as well as group leaders. So, it's important for group leaders to expect it, prepare themselves so they can prepare their group, to experience and resolve the conflict as it emerges. A little bit about conflict, conflict , in groups, typically targets the leader first. Why? Well, the leader represents a safe container for that conflict. Everyone in the room knows that it's coming. They feel it. It's gonna feel tense in the room, and they're wondering, "Who can I confront? How can we experience conflict and move this group to the next level?" It's almost an unconscious, uh, instinct, to go ahead and target the safest person in the room. In most cases, that is the leader. In this particular group's example, that's exactly what happened. I started the group, because, as a, as often in group experience, uh, the group will move to a stage, after they start experiencing this inner personal connection, and it's almost like they're standing on the edge of something big, but they just won't move. That's what I was feeling in this particular group and instead of keeping it inside or continuing trying to push the group members over the edge, what I did, once again, is just put it out into the group. I told the group, "I feel like we're stuck. I have no idea what that means, or what's going on, but I would like to hear your input." That created an atmosphere of openness for people to speak their mind. I felt the tension, I responded to it in a group appropriate way, and that allowed my group members then to respond to it and give us our first taste of conflict. This was interesting because typically, uh, in groups although they will target the leader, it'll be one person at a time, and then other people respond to that confrontation, and then, in this particular group's case, we had two people, and so it became my job to respond to each of them so both of them felt heard. While at the same time, trying to find a consistent theme, that happens to be the easiest way, to, to address it and bonds them together. Mallory was very courageous in speaking up first and she told me that she didn't feel like I understood because she was talking about women's issues and as a man, she felt like I was disconnected. Uh, Greg chimed in next and was very specific about encounters with me where he felt like I had ignored him and not heard what he was trying to say. My job as a group leader is to not be defensive. That is the primary thing that I had going on in my mind. As I don't want to justify my actions, I don't wanna try to explain it away. I wanna continue to create that atmosphere of openness so the entire group can explore. So what I did in this instance is I asked for more information. I tried some reflections. Once again, not being defensive, continuing the dialogue. The underlying theme here, for each of them, is they didn't feel all heard. They didn't feel understood, so everything in my demeanor and my interaction with the group is I want to convey that sense of understanding. At certain times I also wanna get other people's feedback because I'm aware that this confrontation, beyond the general theme of not feeling understood, will also generate some anxiety. People don't like conflict, so I wanted to be able to create a space to give voice to the people who were saying, uh, this just doesn't feel good for me. I expect that, that also gives me an opportunity to normalize those feelings. It's a way to bond everybody together in a very tense situation that may be, for the first time, uh, the group member's experience of being able to see conflict, feel conflict, but to feel it and to experience it in a healthy way. I think the last thing to remember, that, that we saw in group is you don't wanna tie the conflict up in a neat little package, as if it's resolved and we don't have to ever talk about it again. What you want this to be is a hallmark experience which will transport your group into a deeper level of processing, and, so, in my language, as a way to summarize, was that we have a willingness to continue the dialogue. This enables us to, uh, attend directly to the theme of being heard, as well as create that sense that we not only talked about the tough things this time, but we have a dedication to continue that particular conversation.

Commitment to Working as a Group 

01:05:55
CHALEY Well, I just wanted to start off today kind of asking Kurt about, um, how you are doing with, like, the trust issues that you said that you had and... 

01:06:05
KURT Mm-hmm. 

01:06:05
CHALEY ...how that's playing out in group? 

01:06:10
KURT Okay. Um, as we've kind of been talking about through the weeks, uh, I've been having trust issues, uh, since, I had my breakup or my divorce of my wife, and, uh, I've noticed these things, ya know, over the last year, uh, ya know, I've tried dating, ya know, and, uh, ya know, ya know, at some point during the dating process I'll be, ya know, sitting there and, list-, and listening to, uh, ya know, what my partner has to say and I'd be thinkin' in the back of my mind, ya know, ya know, "She doesn't really mean this." Ya know? Ya know, "She's lyin' about this." Ya know, some-, ya know, "Somethin's wrong here." Ya know, and, ya know, and that's happened several times. Ya know, I always think that somebody has ulterior motives now, and they're kinda tryin' to play mind games with me and the trust just isn't there, and that's kind of spilt over in my work. At my business, um, ya know, ya know, when we're, I'm having, uh, deals with my business partners and such, ya know, I'm, ya know, I just have this thing in the back of my mind saying, ya know, "This person isn't telling me the truth anymore." Ya know, the, um, ya know, they're playing a game with me, like, ya know, I've said, ya know, about, ya know, my relationship issues, but it's always in the back of my mind, somebody, is, is, is just, is not telling me the truth and I have a major issue with that, but at the same time I've been trying to work, ya know, through some of that in group, and I've, ya know, I have learned some things. Uh, ya know, along the way and I'm hoping it's helping me. Ya know, in my, uh, in my life situations. So, that's kinda where I'm at right now. 

01:07:50
GREG Boy, that must be a drag, always second guessing yourself as you're interacting. That's gotta be a drag, yeah. 

01:08:00
KURT It is. Uh, ya know, just as, when, when everything that happened in my life went down something really, the abil-, that ability to trust and to form relationships, somewhere, it kinda broke in there. I've been trying to pick up those pieces, an-, and, uh, go from there. 

01:08:10
GROUP LEADER H-, h-, how 'bout, wi-, with, with what just happened? I mean, Cha-, Chaley is a woman and just asked you, a, ques-, a very personal question, wondering, about, about what's going on with you and, I'm, I'm wondering what went through your mind, uh, as you heard her question? 

01:08:30
KURT Hmm. Well, I was glad that she, uh, th-, that she (crosstalk)checked in with me. 

01:08:35
GROUP LEADER Just go ahead and, talk, talk with her about it. 

01:08:35
KURT Okay. Um, I'm glad that you checked in with me. Um, it made me feel good, that somebody would ask me about that. Um, and since, ya know, since we, built, built some rapport here through the weeks, uh, actually I feel like I am starting to trust, ya know, some of you in group, and Chaley, you know, you specifically right now, and it really helps me when, uh, you check in with me, and, and ask how I'm doing. 

01:09:05
CHALEY Mm-hmm. Well, th-, that's kind of where I was at when I was asking you that was, ya know, to let you know that we all are hearing you and that we all care about your issue. Just like you've give us space to talk about our issues too, and, um... 

01:09:25
GREG Mm-hmm. 

01:09:25
 ...um, I'm glad that you're, more, opening up to us and that you feel like you can trust us with some of these things that have been really hard for you. 

01:09:35
KURT Thank you. That makes me, feel, feel good. Uh, I guess, I guess another thing is, ya know, I been kinda lookin' fer, well, I, I identified with Greg, um, ya know, with some of your issues with, ya know, how you view people and how you interact with, uh, ya know, ya know, different races and how you perceive or how you think they perceive you, and I would think that there's some, you've had some trust issues also, is, ya know, how do you, or, how, how are you dealing with some of those issues, if you have those? 

01:10:10
GREG Yeah. yeah, I guess I could say that, uh, I guess I could say that, uh, yeah, we've been meeting a while here and, I, I, got, I gotta be up front that, it, it, I'm a little more comfortable, in terms of talking with everybody here in the group, and, that, that, that, that feels good, uh, uh, there's a, there's some, yeah, there's, th-, th-, th-, there's still, a, you still get that second guessing as you talked about. 

01:10:40
KURT Yeah. 

01:10:40
GREG That you have to deal with, uh, but, uh, yeah, I guess for me, uh, m-, m-, more than the trust thing is just, you get, you get tired of, uh the second guessing. You get tired of wondering if there's games being played, and, uh, that's the, that's kind of for me, wh-, what, what, what, what resonates with me. 

01:11:00
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. 

01:11:00
KURT Yeah, and off of the second guessing term that you used, uh, ya know, wow. I used to be a person that, ya know, trusted everybody, um, ya know, I would always take their word for things and, ya know, I always, ya know, look for the best in people, and now it seems like, ya know, I'm just looking at the negative parts of things and second guessing them. 

01:11:25
GREG Just from your divorce? 

01:11:25
KURT It's, I think that's where it stemmed from, ya know, I think, like I said, there was, there was a break somewhere in there and, just, uh, I'm having, ya know, the issue with that. I'm, I'm still struggling with it. 

01:11:35
GREG Hmm. 

01:11:35
KURT So, yeah. 

01:11:45
GROUP LEADER And my guess is, that, that when you do that second guessing and perceive that other people, are, are, as you mentioned, playing games, or, or being less, than, than upfront with you, you have a tendency to withdraw, and, and pull back? 

01:12:00
KURT I, I think , that's, uh, that's very accurate. I do. 

01:12:05
GROUP LEADER I'm, I'm wondering how other people have perceived Kurt in group, because one of the things, that, that he's working on, is, is trust, an-, and working past that fear and trying to stay connected, and so have you been aware, or, or, or what times have you been aware that he has either disconnected or you felt him withdraw, or times that you felt him really stay in there? So, think of something, and you're experience of him, and, and share that with him. 

01:12:40
AMANDA I've really felt like impressed, and, I mean, I never said anything cuz it seems kind of awkward but, that, uh, you track so well with all of us and seem to, like, have insight or comments and, like, I mean, you've been, just kind of caring about what's going on because I feel like what I came into work on is so different than what you came into work on but you're still here and you're engaging and so, I mean, that's just, has seemed, to me, just really impressive that, as someone who, may not, or, you've even expressed, like, you didn't come in feeling super comfortable in the group. You, like, have come committed to the work. So, that, that's been my experience of you here. 

01:13:25
KURT Okay. 

01:13:25
CAROLINE And I think for me, um, kind of similar, we came in for very different things and I just can't imagine, um, what you've gone through, what you're currently going through, and I know at the very beginning when you talked about it, I was very intimidated by that and, ya know, how does, how do my issues of stress compare to your life completely changing, and, so one of my fears toward the beginning was that, um, maybe you wouldn't view our problems, as, as big a deal as yours but just the way that you have engaged with us, an-, and you've made me feel like you understand that what I'm going through is a big deal to me, and that has just meant the world to me. 

01:14:10
KURT 'Kay. Um, kind of in response to that, um, I guess off the top of my mind, in no way, do, did I feel that anybody's problems were any less significant... 

01:14:20
CAROLINE Right. 

01:14:20
KURT ...uh, than mine to start out with, at all. Uh, I think everybody deals with their problems differently, and, uh, has different perceptions about those problems, um, like, for example, the stress in your life, ya know, it sounds like it's really been effecting you. Um, just as, ya know, my problems have affected me, I don't see it as one less or more than, ya know, the other. So, thank you for your input. 

01:14:45
CAROLINE You have no idea how much that means to me to hear. 

01:14:50
KURT 'Kay. 

01:14:55
MALLORY And I like how Caroline said about him perceiving our problems and then I like how you said that our problems did matter to you because if I'm sitting here talking about gender roles, and trying to balance a relationship with other things I have going on, and you're recently divorced, I kind of felt like me saying that would, have, make you withdrawal from the group, but it really, I felt, brought you in to connect all of us to show how that, even though our problems are so different, that we're still all connected. 

01:15:30
CHALEY I'm like, (ph)I'm just really impressed with all the bravery that, I mean, with everyone sharing their, taking risks to share in the group and you trusting us even just a little bit. Um, it helps me to understand, and, and let, do less second guessing. Um, I think in my personal relationships at home and, um, even here, because I feel like you guys will tell me what you're really meaning, like, I don't have to second guess, um, like, whenever I, I don't know, if I confronted Caroline or you, Kurt, uh, like if, you would let me know, like, I've, I need this from you, and this from the group. I think Greg was even saying, that, what he needed from the group earlier. So, that makes me feel more comfortable. 

01:16:25
COUNSSELOR Okay. 

01:16:30
KURT One thing I'm feeling right now, uh, is this dialogue that we're having right now, um, I feel like I'm closer to you guys just by having these conversations. Uh, and I think that is helping me. I think this is, uh, is very helpful for me just to become closer with, uh, people and, uh, talk with them about their problems and my problems and, what we're, (ph)both going through, so thank y'all. 

01:16:55
GROUP LEADER It sounds like the risk isn't as scary as it was before because of the connections, that, that you've made that you feel supported in being more of your real self. 

01:17:10
GREG You feel more comfortable. I think that you feel more comfortable when you get to interact with people and, then, then you feel a little more accepted. Yo-, yo-, you're right, you're right. You're right. 

01:17:20
GROUP LEADER Oh, I did want to check in with you because, as, as, as Kurt, was, was relating, to, to your, um, issue, ya know, he has a similar thing going. Uh, he didn't call them antenna, he had talked about hearing someone talk and then processing it and wondering... 

01:17:35
GREG Hmm. 

01:17:40
GROUP LEADER ...and I'm wondering, as, as, Kurt connected with you, what, what were your antenna saying? 

01:17:40
GREG Um, that, that, that he was real. That he was real and that he was reaching out. Uh, and it felt natural, and it felt natural. Uh, I think that's all part of us being together for a while and, uh, working with each other. It feels a lot more natural, uh, at least from my perspective. 

01:18:05
GROUP LEADER Okay. Good. 

01:18:05
CHALEY I feel that naturalness too. That you can bring things up and it's, uh, it's a comfortable place to be. I mean, a little scary cuz, uh, anything that you bring up from yourself and share with the world is a little scary, but, um, I feel like you guys are going to listen and... 

01:18:30
GREG I like what,,, 

01:18:30
CHALEY give me real feedback. 

01:18:35
GREG Yeah, I like what you said but it is more comfortable. Uh, yeah, I, I, I like what you said earlier. I feel if I throw somethin' out there, uh, I'm gonna get, uh, I, I, I, I don't feel as much I need to second guess what people are saying, and, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's kind of a good new story. Uh, kinda makes you think, makes me think, 'kay, why I can't translate that more out there in the world? Ya know what I'm... But, but you're right. It's a little more comfortable. (crosstalk) 

01:19:00
CAROLINE Greg, you have no idea how good it is to hear you say that. Cuz I know for me, on thing is I've been wondering what your antenna are saying about me, and so, just hearing you say that this is a place that you feel like you don't have to second guess yourself just makes me, be, breathe this huge sigh of relief, knowing that, um... 

01:19:20
GREG Wow. 

01:19:20
CAROLINE I'm not adding to your problem, ya know, (crosstalk)adding to the thing that you wanna work about. That is good to hear. 

01:19:25
GREG Thanks. Yeah, I, I do, but more thanks to you guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, being more trusting as we sit through there. (ph) 

01:19:35
GROUP LEADER An-, an-, and it works in so many different ways. I mean, we've done a lot of hard work in checking those things out. Whether they're antenna or, we-, whether we call them second guessing or anything. We all have that mechanism, and you have each done a lot of work getting outside of your head and processing that in the group.You don't have to wait to do that right? If you're wondering about how someone is perceiving you in group and you're feeling that in the moment, then that's really the next step, to say, "Ya know, I know this doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about, but Greg, I'm wondering, ya know, about us. I'm wondering if there's anything that you need to say to me. Um, or if there's anything, that, that, uh, you, ya know, you've perceived about me because your perception is important." And that's the next step. We don't get that a lot in relationships but if you're feeling in the group that we're beginning to get into a place of honesty and openness, then that's the next step. 

01:20:40
GROUP LEADER This segment provides a great example of moving into the commitment stage, or the working stage of a group. In this particular stage, group members begin to take on greater responsibility for the work of the group, and that's great news because what that means is the leader moves more into the process observer or facilitator role. In the beginning stages of group, as you might've noticed, the leader takes great responsibility. If you compared this segment to the first segment, you'll notice that in the first segment I'm doing a lot more. I'm connecting people or I'm reflecting, I'm doing a lot modeling of good group behavior. In this particular segment, what you're seeing is the fruits of my labor in that first stage. Group members start to take on much more of the moment to moment interaction. As a result of the, con-, conflict resolution, experiencing that and feeling safe within the group, we're now moving into a deeper level of processing. That, combined with more group member responsibility makes for a very exciting time, in, in the group work. One of the best examples of that is when Mallory became very curious about what was going on with Kurt. This is a great example of exactly what goes on at this level. Members begin to feel safe about being curious about what's going on with the other members. Once again, it's very rarely about external relationships and much more about here and now, and that makes it much more intense. In the example that I was speaking about, Mallory becomes curious about Kurt and his particular trust issues and how that's been playing out in group. Kurt takes time, thinks about it, seems very touched that Mallory would be thinking of them, and they have a nice hear and now interchange. Then that sparks Kurt being curious about what's going on with Greg, and they have an excellent interchange of ideas and expressions and insights that could've only been sparked if you really feel comfortable about the group and what's going on at this level. Here's where the real work begins. As the group keeps going, what will continue to happen is group members will continue to bring their own personal awareness into group and begin to get feedback from other members. This in turn will plug into each member's individual goals as well as group goals and real progress can be made on both.

GROUP LEADER Okay. Well, welcome back to group, as we've been talking about the past few weeks, uh, next week is our last group. It'll be our last time together. Um, so this will be a time where we start wrapping things up. It'll be a chance for us to say goodbye, uh, to the group. To the members of the group, and, and the work that we've done. Uh, I know, that, that saying goodbye often brings up some pretty powerful memories, uh, and without processing those, that can actually get in the way of the work that we need to do to say goodbye to each other. We all have a history of goodbyes and not all of them have been real positive. Some of them have been very painful, and so I wanted to give space to talk about that in preparation, uh, for the work that we'll do next week. So what I wanted to do is, just, just provide a space for each one of you, to, to share that when I say, saying goodbye, um, what comes up for you? 

01:24:45
AMANDA Um, for me, the, the first thing that I think of is, um, the only real goodbye that I've had, recently, like in the last couple of years, um, was a really bad, like it was an ending of a relationship that was so severe that, like, we don't have any contact and it's sort of, um, mm, I have the propensity toward want, even the, if, like, a relationship isn't functional in that, in one sense, I'm still the one who wants to say, like, "Okay, well, when we go our separate ways let's..." ya know, "I still think fondly of you and I still care and I'll check in every once in a while." Um, and we, like, totally can't do that, and so, it makes me a little scared cuz I feel like we don't know each other outside of group and so I'm not going to be able to call Caroline and say, "Hey, I just, you know, saw this ad about having too much to do and I thought of you and I wanted to check in." And, um, so it feels like that goodbye was really unnatural and I feel like that's, gonna, it's gonna be like that here. 

01:26:00
GROUP LEADER So some fear about the disconnection... 

01:26:00
AMANDA Yeah. 

01:26:00
GROUP LEADER ... and the loss of this experience? 

01:26:05
AMANDA Mm-hmm. 

01:26:05
GROUP LEADER Okay. 

01:26:10
KURT I guess I can kinda relate to some of that, uh, this, like, recently, obviously some of my relationships haven't ended very well, uh, and, uh, but that's not normally how I am. Normally, uh, I don't have much of a problem saying goodbye normally, um, but, uh, I'm, you know, kind of apprehensive right now about, ya know, what's gonna happen, at this point, and this group, so, that's kinda what I'm feeling right now. 

01:26:40
UNKNOWN Okay. Good. 

01:26:45
CHALEY Um, I think my experience with this, I, thinking of one particular right now, I'm in the middle of saying goodbye to one of my roommates, she's moving, to go get married, and, um, it's a good thing and so I'm, like, excited for her but at the same time, I'm very sad for all the things that I'm losing from her relationship. The things that, like, she gave me, like, she's the one that, like, if I say, "Let's go do this." Like, she's down for anything, all the time, and, like, you know, she'd like, I go to her for specific information and I'm gonna lose that in her and that makes me really, sa-, I mean, happy, so, and sad at the same time and I guess that's kind of how I feel about this group. Um, like, you guys, ha-, are like a, just a, I don't know what the word is but, like, a wealth of, like, knowledge, so that I can, um, learn more about myself and learn, ya know, how to be with other people, but, um, so that makes me sad but happy that we can move on. 

01:27:55
GROUP LEADER Mm. 

01:27:55
CHALEY I don't know. 

01:28:00
GROUP LEADER Yeah. 

01:28:00
CAROLINE Yeah, I think, um, I have such mixed feelings about goodbyes, an-, and I just think about the last really big goodbye that I had, um, was whenever I moved here, for grad school, um, I was in a relationship and we made the decision to break up, an, and it was just awful and I really relate to what you're saying. Like, we can't speak, we, you know, um, and so there was such a lack of resolution that I still feel, to this day, even though it's been years, an-, um, so, on the one hand, I get so nervous about it, but also with that, knowing, um, that there were a lot of possibilities for me in that goodbye, and, and moving here and coming to grad school was the best decision, ya know, I could've ever made, and, and meeting someone new who is perfect for me, and, um, fulfilling my dream in a city that I love, and so, yeah, it just, it's just very, bittersweet maybe sounds too clichÃ©, but, ya know, in here I think about I am so going to miss this but I know that, um, I'm a better person for having been here, so, it's just, it's a lot of really confusing stuff when I think about goodbyes. 

01:29:20
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. Yeah, mixed feelings, (crosstalk)lots of mixed feelings. 

01:29:20
CAROLINE Yeah, definitely mixed feelings. 

01:29:25
MALLORY Well I definitely have mixed feelings as well, because I feel like, that Caroline really, cou-, we kind of came in with the same issue of balance and I feel like she's helped me work through my problems so I can talk to her about it, but then, now, saying goodbye, as Amanda said, I can't just call her up on the phone because this is our group relationship, so I definitely have mixed feelings as well because I know it's going to be hard but then I feel like there's a good possibility of moving on and having more opportunities in the future based on what I've learned in this group. 

01:30:05
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah. 

01:30:10
CAROLINE Thank you for that. 

01:30:15
GREG Well, it sounds, it, it, I can hitchhike on mixed feelings for sure, uh, as I, as I, I think about us coming to and end and that I really appreciated everybody here in the group. Uh, you guys remember, I shared with you, I, I've got a, I've got a lot of history with goodbye because I'm retired military. So I've moved around a lot and I've had to do a lot of goodbyes. So goodbye is somethin' that's just been a part of my life a lot. Uh, so, I, I'm, uh, I've experienced that, now, I, I, I, so, in, in terms, of, of the goodbye experience, uh, I, I, I'm okay with being able to step away from situations, and, and, and, and things, but this feels a little different because, uh, I've always been able to keep in touch with people that I wanna keep in touch with when I said goodbye before. Uh, but we're gonna go out in all kinds of separate ways and we know each other here... 

01:31:10
CAROLINE Mm-hmm. 

01:31:10
GREG But we don't know each other, as, as you said Amanda, we don't know each other, outside of this, outside of this environment, and you guys have been great and I've enjoyed it. So, yeah, it's kinda mixed feelings about that. This is a different, this is a different goodbye than what, I, I've been able to deal with before, for what it's worth, so... 

01:31:30
CAROLINE Yeah, like we can't recreate this experience, even if we were to see each other (crosstalk)afterwards. 

01:31:35
GREG That's a good point. (crosstalk)That's a good point Caroline. That's a good point. So we've got to kind of step away from here and be on our own don't we? 

01:31:40
ENSEMBLE Yeah. 

01:31:40
GREG I hear ya, I hear ya, I hear ya. 

01:31:45
GROUP LEADER And like you said, on, on one hand that feels really good because it's empowering and, on the other hand, it's, it's sad, to, to leave a meaningful, e-, experience, and, and the relationships behind. I'm glad we had a chance, to, to process that and sorta know where we stand with goodbyes and being able to honor those mixed feelings, and because next week will be our goodbye, and as a group, we have to figure out how we're gonna do that, and we don't have to do that today. What I want you to do, is, is, you know, honor the feelings, that, that you're, ha-, that you're having (crosstalk)and just like we've done everything else, we're gonna decide as a group, uh, next week, how we're gonna bring this to a close. There may be times over the week, because of the mixed feelings, that you feel like, "Well, maybe it's just better that I not come." Uh, and I want to encourage everyone, out of respect for the group, uh, despite the feelings that you might have, and despite the fact that it may be easier not to address it, to go ahead and, have that last, have that last meeting. Beyond saying goodbye, uh, it is also a time to tie up the work that we've done and to acknowledge the progress that we've made, to, to see what else needs to be done. It's also, I guess, for the rest of the time today, uh, would be good to just sorta think about, what's, what's left unsaid. What have you been, or needing to say, to another group member that for whatever reason, you just haven't taken that chance or the opportunity just hasn't presented itself. Today is a good way, a good time, um, to address that, and so I'm wondering if any, as you're thinking about that, what, what comes up for you. 

01:33:35
[sil.] 

01:33:40
MALLORY Well, I haven't told Caroline yet, at in depth, how thankful I am for her being able to share her experience. So, when I'm at home and I see dishes piled up, laundry piled up, homework papers, everything going on, I feel that there are other people out in the world, and not only Caroline, but through all of our experiences, I felt that everyone has made me grow as a person, in knowing that I'm not alone. 

01:34:10
AMANDA I wanted to share with Kurt actually, um, just in the last few sessions I felt like, uh, really you kind of pulling away, and, I, I felt, like we've talked about, like, Greg's antenna and how he'll have...I've just had this sense that you were just really pulling back and pulling away. 

01:34:35
KURT Um, I guess, first of all, I'm kinda surprised that you said that, um, as I wasn't aware of that, um, I'm not exactly sure why, um, if it made you feel uncomfortable I guess I wanna say I'm sorry. Um, uh, maybe there, maybe there is some unresolved things, maybe, I'm tryin' to deal with here as we come to a close. 

01:35:05
AMANDA I, I kinda feel like you're doing it now. 

01:35:05
KURT Okay. 

01:35:05
AMANDA You feel that? (ph) 

01:35:10
KURT Okay. Well, um, like I said, uh, maybe I am feeling a little bit different as we're coming to a close right now, and maybe I'm withdrawing from you a little bit. Maybe it's from, maybe it's, ya know, stemming from my, I guess, ya know, trust and trust issues, and, and, you know, just that recently I haven'[t had a real good chance to say a, you know, goodbye. Uh, and, uh, I don't know, I'm just kinda mixed up about that, kinda dealin' with that right now. (crosstalk) so. 

01:35:45
GROUP LEADER Wha-, what would you like Kurt to do Amanda? 

01:35:50
AMANDA I guess... 

01:35:50
GROUP LEADER Tell, tell him. 

01:35:50
AMANDA Oh, um, ya know we've talked before about, I just really valued how, like here and present you were, and how will you were to engage, um, whether that meant, like, you just paying attention to all of us or giving us of yourself, and, I, I haven't felt that and I would love, you know, we do still have today, and we have our last session for, to, to still just have just as much of you here. 

01:36:20
KURT Okay. Okay, uh, that's something I will, definitely pay attention to as we spend our last couple sessions together, and, uh, uh, I guess thank you for bring that up. I'll, I'll pay attention to it. 

01:36:35
GROUP LEADER Yeah, it's, it's such a brilliant example and great feedback of exactly what we were talking about. How the history of our goodbyes and our connections, they impact us, and I think what I heard, you, you say is that, you're, you're sensing him moving away. It would make sense that as we're ending and you feel us moving away from you, that you're moving to protect yourself. What I hear from Amanda is she misses you and values that connection and wants you here so we can have, so she can have, so you can have, so we could all have a real quality goodbye. That'd be a different, ex-, example, of, of painful ones that we've experienced in the past. 

01:37:20
KURT I think that makes sense. At least to me. 

01:37:30
GROUP LEADER In this particular clip, what we were trying to capture was how to prepare a group for termination. It's difficult to say when exactly is the perfect time to prepare for termination. In a closed group, like this group, where we only have a set amount of sessions, I would say that you begin to talk about termination from the beginning, because as soon as the group begins, the group begins to end. You know when it's going to end, everybody in group knows when it's going to end, and so it's never too early to talk about it. In a group such as this, where we're really talking about the aspects of termination, I would say two to three sessions out, you wanna start preparing them. In an open group, where there is no definite set time of ending, each group member will phase out of the group as their individual goals are met. This makes it more difficult for the group leader. You must keep in mind each member's individual goals, and as that person makes progress, then you want to prepare them for termination. In the case of this group, it is a closed group. We know that it's going to end and so I feel like it's in the best interest of the group to prepare them for termination. One of the ways that I like to do this is to talk about goodbyes, because that's really what termination is about for this group. Saying goodbye to the group members and the experiences that we've shared. As a group leader, I don't assume what goodbyes mean to each individual, grou-, group member. I want to hear from them. So, therefore I created an experience where each person can talk a little bit about what it means to say goodbye. It enables me to see where they're coming from and using that filter of, "What is this going to look like in group?" It allows us to process that and prepare adequately for termination. Thought the group did a great job of talking about goodbyes, talking about mixed feelings, both positives and negatives about saying goodbye and we were able to brainstorm and get a commitment to continue to think about those things and carry it forth into our final meeting. The other thing that I like to do in this pre-termination session is to create some time and space for people to consider, "What else do I need to say in group?" And maybe to the group as a whole or it may be to an individual member. Another way to put this is, "What unfinished business do I have?" It's a good way for group members to begin to tie up this experience and realize that we have to bring a closure to the work that we've done. A great example of that is when Amanda was able to give some feedback to Kurt. If you don't remember this section, go back and watch it, because it's very powerful. Amanda was able to give some here and now experiencing to Kurt and say, "I feel like you've been withdrawing." And Kurt responded in a way of basically saying, "Hey I didn't really know it." In, in a sense I got the feeling that Amanda felt like he was brushing her off. She did a marvelous job coming right back at him and saying, "You're doing it now." Once again, a great example of that here and now immediacy that is so common at this stage of the group. The most beautiful thing that happened is that, upon reflection, Kurt was able to see how what was going on was directly tied to his view of termination and saying goodbye. It intertwined with his presenting problem so elegantly that I don't think he was quite aware of it until Amanda pointed it out, of how is behavior was coming out and manifesting in the group. For me, in reviewing that aspect of the group session, this is exactly why I prepare people for termination. You see, if you don't prepare them for termination then their feelings come as a surprise, and what happens is you get in a situation where group members are experiencing those mixed feelings with no group context. The most unfortunate consequence is that people will not show up for the last group because they're afraid of the goodbye. By processing the goodbyes, by giving people space to work on some unfinished business and move toward closure will give you the greatest probability of having a healthy termination session in your group.

Termination 

01:42:05
GROUP LEADER Okay, well, welcome back to group, uh, as we've been discussing, this is our, this is our last group together, our last time, and, uh, thank you all for coming. Uh, we talked last time about goodbyes, and, and what that meant. So, um, just to set the agenda for this week, as I mentioned, it's, it's gonna be a time to acknowledge the work that we've done, uh, tie up any lose ends, uh, and then, uh, find a way, as a group, that we can say goodbye and that'll bring a closure to this experience. Okay. Uh, eh, one way to acknowledge the work that we've done is just maybe, to, to think and talk a little bit about, I don't know, something that you feel like you gave to the group during your time here, and maybe something that you got from the group, and, just, just your thoughts on that. 

01:43:00
MALLORY Well, I feel like, I, what I gave to the group were my experiences of being a woman interacting with the traditional roles of the male and female and how we could relate that to each other's experiences, and what I really took from the group was everyone's experiences of how to balance your time, how you handle conflicting roles, how not to get so stressed out when you feel like you have so much stuff to do... 

01:43:30
GROUP LEADER Hmm. 

01:43:30
MALLORY ...by prioritizing and time management and making a calendar and setting all of your time up. 

01:43:40
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So you found some practical ways to utilize the.... 

01:43:40
MALLORY Yes. 

01:43:40
GROUP LEADER ...the information that the relationships that you've had. Good. 

01:43:50
GREG Well, you know, uh, in terms, of, of, of, of gave to the group, uh, ya, Caroline, I remember you had said, the time where you had said earlier that you're real uncomfortable with conflict. I remember that. Remember we talked it... you remember that? 

01:44:05
CAROLINE Mm. 

01:44:05
GREG And, uh, and I remember though, how, how, uh, uh, you, you were able to interact, you and I, and, uh, be able to talk, and, and talk through some uncomfortable stuff... 

01:44:15
CAROLINE Yeah, yeah. 

01:44:15
GREG ...as we stepped through there and, uh, uh, kinda, wha-, what I gave to the group, and kinda what I got from the group, kinda, they both tie in cuz I hope, that, that was something, that, that you might've been, value added for you, as we stepped (ph)through there. But I gotta tell you what I got from the group is being able to do that. What I got from the group is being able to, uh, talk to you guys. I came in here in the beginning and told you that, the, talked about, ya know, racial difference, and, and, and how intensely I feel, how, how intensely I could sometimes feel different. Uh, and no, I, doesn't mean I walk outta here, all of a sudden feel like I'm the same, but it definitely helps me to walk outta here, and, uh, uh, uh, just feel better about, uh, being able to interact because I had a chance to talk about it with you guys and, uh, uh, in this laboratory, for lack of a better description, it really, it really helped. So, uh, I got that from all of you and I really appreciate that so I want you to know that. 

01:45:15
GROUP LEADER You know, I've been thinking a lot about, uh, about our discussion about feeling disconnected and, I, I think over our time together what I figured out is whenever I heard you in the first group say that you felt different, I automatically thought, that, that meant, haah, that you wanted to be less different, and I think that was a mistake, that I, that I made because one of the things that I think you've done and you've taught me here and you just said it, uh, is that, yo-, you're not any less different than you were than when you started, where, none, none of us are. We're each the same person as when we began and we're all different, but, you're no different from when you began, but you're more connected than when you began and I think that's what I missed is you weren't, acting, you weren't asking to be less different. You were asking to be more connected, and more (crosstalk)and more accepted and heard. 

01:46:10
GREG (crosstalk)I like that, that talks, that talks to me and I like that. That talks to me, I like that. Yeah, yeah. 

01:46:15
GROUP LEADER So I wasn't gonna participate, (crosstalk)but, but that's what I got from the group. 

01:46:15
GREG ...I appreciate it. (crosstalk)Yeah, I appreciate it. 

01:46:20
CHALEY I think, going on that, I think, um, I gave that connection and that ability to connect with you and connect with everyone here, um, I really opened myself up for that and I think I gave that and hopefully, you, you guys felt that and Greg just said he did, um, and then something I got was, just, the bravery of everyone sharing, um, being okay to share, like, "Hey, this is what I experience." Like, with you Greg, and you Mallory, and Amanda, last week how you were saying, you know, hey Kurt, uh, I've been experiencing you this way and sometimes, I'm, I've been scared to do that in the past, like, I have these, sec-, second guessing and I have become more okay with saying, "Okay, there's, there's second guessing in my head, if I really need to I can check with someone else, I can really go and check with them and see if that's really true or if it's just me in my head or whatever and I'm thankful that you guys shared your bravery with me and I've really learned from that. 

01:47:35
GROUP LEADER Mm. 

01:47:35
CAROLINE I'll go, um, this is gonna sound kinda weird so I hope it comes across the way that it sounds in my head. Um, but, I think what I gave to this group was my presence. It was really a battle to not let this become another item on the to do list, and there were many weeks when I just felt so overwhelmed and I wanted to give in to that stuck feeling, but, um, I still came and was here and that, to me, was a really big deal, and, um, kind of a long those same lines, the thing that, I, I got from this was, um, I got to see that I can kinda power through that feeling of being paralyzed in the midst of, you know, everything that's going on, and, um, to very positive results, and so instead of just, ya know, hanging out on the couch and just feeling woe is me and I can't do anything and this is too overwhelming, um, I could do something and not even something on my to do list but something that takes care of me, and, and that made, um, that made, uh, a lot of difference. 

01:48:50
AMANDA It's, I mean, like it sounds, I think we're all kind of having the same experience. We're like, "Well, what I gave and that is sorta hard to say, I'm not sure why, but I noticed it with all of us. Um, what I gave, mostly, is just coming and caring about every week. Um, and carrying that out, throughout the week because it would've been really easy to kinda switch into that mode, just when I got here and, cuz I don't see any of y'all otherwise, but processing, tho-, the things, the topics that we're covering throughout the week, not just in myself but also caring about the growth everyone else is having. Um, and that's really also what I got from the group was hearing everyone's, kind of, issues throughout the week, or how we're growing, or what we're experiencing and then taking that home. That really helped get me out of myself, and, so, like, my big issue was just kind of figuring out who I am and how to represent that, um, and it really was helped by the fact that I had other things to care about than worrying about myself. 

01:50:05
[sil.] 

01:50:10
KURT Um, as far as, uh, thinking about, when I, what I gave to the group, I'd like to think that I gave, uh, effort. Um, I came to the group every week, uh, hoping that I could share, ya know, some things about myself and also learn about others and from week to week, ya know, I, I tried my best, uh, to be attentive, uh, and, and to listen to others, ya know, as well as, uh, share some difficulties that I'm going through, and, uh, I'm not sure exactly how that came out to everybody, if, if y'all felt that way at times but, uh, I just wanna say I did try and I did give effort, and, uh, that's what I feel like I gave to the group. Um, as far as getting, f-, what I got from the group, um, um, I think it's gonna take some time just to kinda realize what I took and what I've learned from this group, but I do wanna say that I've learned a lot. Uh, ya know, over the time we've been, uh, uh, meeting with one another. Um, I felt good that people listened to me, um, and I think maybe, uh, ya know, just the camaraderie that I've built with some of y'all really helped with my trust issues and I do trust y'all and that means a lot to me and I'm gonna ya know, try to bring this trust that I've formed with y'all out into my life, and, and we'll see how that progresses, (crosstalk)as time goes on. 

01:51:40
GREG Hmm. 

01:51:45
GROUP LEADER Hmm. Ya know, I, I remember the first group meeting and when you talked about your particular issue and I got so excited from a group leader perspective because that issue of working on trust is such a great, natural, uh, goal to have and the reason why I got so excited is because, haah, it's not something that you can just talk about... 

01:52:05
KURT Mm-hmm. 

01:52:05
GROUP LEADER Ya know, I, I knew that through the life of the group that if we did what we needed to do and you were active, then you would make progress. That something would happen because this was about relationships and, I, I hope, what you, what you all take from this, an-, and building off of your issue is inner personal issues, like, trust, or feeling different and wanting to be connected or, uh, being understood and balancing, it's not a passive process. It's an active process and if you think about all the growth that you've made, it wasn't from sitting back and just sort of observing. It was about taking a risk and getting out there and making something happen. So that process of connection actually did a lot of good, for, for each one of your goals. One of the things that we did discuss is that we have to come up with a way to say goodbye as a group, to bring this issue as a, uh, this group, to a close and, uh, as I said, we're gonna decide that as a group and see what feels right for us. Uh, any, any ideas? 

01:53:20
CAROLINE Um, I might have one. Um, something that really stuck with me from the first session, that I, I, at the time, thought was going to be very silly but ended up being pretty powerful, um, was, we had a moment at the end of the first session to just kind of look at each person. Look them in the eyes, and, and think of something that we learned about them, and I still go back to that and I still try to do that, um, and think each time, ya know, what, what am I learning about this person, and so, I, I think I would really love to kind of, um, end where we began, in a sense, so... 

01:54:00
GROUP LEADER Mm-hmm. Okay. 

01:54:00
GREG Hmm. 

01:54:05
GROUP LEADER Sorta come full circle? 

01:54:05
CAROLINE Yeah, (crosstalk)yeah, yeah. 

01:54:05
KURT That's a great idea Caroline. 

01:54:10
CAROLINE Thanks. 

01:54:10
GROUP LEADER Okay, all right. 

01:54:10
GREG Hmm. 

01:54:10
GROUP LEADER Any objections to that, or? 

01:54:15
GREG I think it sounds pretty good. 

01:54:15
GROUP LEADER Okay. 

01:54:15
MALLORY I think that sounds like a good idea... 

01:54:20
GREG Yeah, I remember that. 

01:54:20
MALLORY ...it's like a new beginning as well. 

01:54:20
GROUP LEADER Okay. 

01:54:20
CHALEY It's like the linking the circle.

GROUP LEADER So yeah, I, it, it, it, and it's neat because that's an experience that we all had. (crosstalk)We'll take the last, uh, few minutes that we have in group, and much like we did the first time, I want you to make sure that you make eye contact, with, with each person and that'll be your way of saying goodbye, and, ya know, I, I don't know if I wanna put any stipulations on what it is that you wanna think of when you make eye contact with that person. It might be what you gave that person, or what you got from them, or, just whatever you need to do to close out that relationship. Um, you'll close it when you break eye contact and move on to the next person, and, uh, when all that, is, is done, uh, then we will be done and we will leave. So, go ahead, and, and start.

GROUP LEADER Okay, this is it. That was the end of the group. This was our termination session. The job of the group leader at this stage is to bring the group to a healthy closure. Uh, things that you wanna watch out for are people responding to termination by trying to create new topics, uh, trying to go back to old problems and reopen old issues. In some ways, that's a group member's normal way of trying to prolong the life of the group. Uh, everything that you're doing at this particular stage is trying to bring them, to, the, a close. In a sense, it parallels that first session. Uh, if you think about it, as we've discussed before, the group leader's very active at the beginning, becomes less active in the middle and then returns to a level of greater activity at the end, and so it's okay to structure this termination a bit. As long as you're keeping in mind that you wanna give your group members enough time to talk about their feelings around closure as well as think about things that they've learned and then respond adequately to saying goodbye in a way that's healthy for them. In this case I chose to be more directive with the group. I gave them something to consider and think about and answer as a way to address what is it that you gave to the group and what is it that you got from the group. So they're able to think about their contribution as well as their learning. It's important at termination to also try to make the translation back from the internal process of the group back to their external lives. I want them walking away thinking, "What I've learned in group is going to be important to me in my external relationships." So I tend to listen for ways they contributed or things that they got from the group and try to help them make that transition from inside group experience to outside group experience. Now, I thought the group did a pretty good job of going around and considering their place in the group, and for the most part they had no problems identifying contribution, as well as, uh, different items that they learned from the group, and I thought, like I said, they did a good job with that. Now, the last thing that we have to do in a termination session is to say goodbye, and I worked myself into a bit of a corner there because I put it to the group that we wanted to agree and come to a group consensus about how to say goodbye. That's a little bit challenging because, as I mentioned, termination can bring up a lot of mixed feelings for people and so I would've been, in, in quite a jam if everybody had a different idea of saying goodbye. Um, luckily, they responded as most groups do. I'm sure they did some thinking about it but the fact that they were anxious about it meant that they really wanted it to be a group decision, and in this case, means they wanted to talk about it as a group. I think what we experienced is, fairy, fairly typical, uh, we had some silence. I think they were making eye contact with each other, trying to feel out if anyone had an idea, and then what happened is what usually happens. Someone has an idea. In this case, I think it was a wonderful idea. Caroline came up with the concept of ending how we started as a group. For whatever reason, the eye contact experiment that I had them do in the first session of the group was meaningful for her. It's something that she remembered, and so she thought it would be a great idea to recreate that as a way of saying goodbye. I went ahead and did put some structure on that. Uh, and so what I encouraged them to do is to look in the group member's eyes, and, and just sorta say goodbye in your own way, maybe think of things that you've learned from that person, but I didn't necessarily put any stipulations on exactly what they had to be thinking. I created time and space for them to complete that and at the moment, that, that was over, group was finished.
