Hypnosis and Anxiety: 

00:00:25
Opportunities Beyond Relaxation 

00:00:25
Lynn Lyons, LICSW 

00:00:30
LYNN LYONS So welcome everyone. I'm Lynn Lyons. Uh… I have one congregate lecture and I am an anxiety person and I also do a lot of hypnotic work, the act of hypnosis and then I also just incorporate hypnosis into most of my work. Umm… and so we're gonna do a little demonstration here with umm… lovely enough to volunteer to allow me to use her as an example. Umm… so we only have until 10:30 and then I'd be here 10:30 and I do my pediatric hypnosis workshop at 10:45. I don't know where but I'll find out, evening 10:30 and 10:45. Where is it? 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Regency. 

00:01:20
LYNN LYONS Oh, thank you so much. All right so umm… let me just say uh… uh… a little bit about sort of my, my thoughts about hypnosis umm… and certainly my thoughts about anxiety and hypnosis because one of the interesting things that when many people are learning about hypnosis and talking about hypnosis, is that it's all about calming down and it's all about relaxing, how can we get comfortable. An interesting thing about anxiety is that the way that I treat is merely saying, it's, it's about being uncomfortable. It's about accepting that we don't know what's going to happen. It's about moving forward despite the fact that we don't have certainty, we don't have clarity, we don't have comfort. So when we are doing hypnosis umm… with anxiety and incorporating it into our treatment of something as anxiety, it, it can pose an interesting challenge for both the client and for you as the therapist if the goal is to calm down. That's often when, when anybody comes to you with anxiety, they want you to get rid of the anxiety and it is your job then to reframe it in a way that, that acknowledges that, that is not only impossible because we're designed to worry, this little pre-frontal cortex of ours here, this is what keeps us going. Right, I say to kids all the time, look, I've got no fangs, I've got no armor, I've got no fur, I'm not very fast. I can't jump high, all I have is my wrist and so where you have to worry with this rather than to present to somebody like we're gonna get rid of these symptoms. We're eliminating nothing and so that offers us some interesting possibilities. When I work with people and supervise people about doing hypnosis with anxiety, they tend to focus quite a bit on this, right and a lot of people will say, well, I learnt breathing exercises, which are great. But I want to as you're, as you're watching this demonstration, I would like you to pay particularly attention to uh… how many more possibilities, how many more uh… options we have, when we are working with our anxious clients rather than just focus on calming down. Right because when somebody is freaking out and you say, calm down, right, how many people go, oh, my, oh thanks I haven't thought of that. Oh, thank you so, great, oh, oh, yeah, oh that was the piece, I was missing, that whole calm down thing. So anyway, all right. Okay, so, Carol. 

00:03:55
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:03:55
LYNN LYONS Thank you again. Tell me, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask the opening question that I ask whenever I'm, I'm working with, with kids and adults. So let's just imagine it a month from now or six months from now and you are thinking back or you're chatting with someone and you say, you know, I did this demonstration at the Erickson congress and it was so successful because, how would you answer that question? 

00:04:25
CAROL KERSHAW Because I no longer get this tightness in my chest and focus on my heart and I gotten back to that where I have been some months before I got a phone call while I was at this conference in even before I came to the conference. 

00:04:45
LYNN LYONS Yeah, okay. So you got, you would go back to where you have been. 

00:04:45
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:04:45
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:04:45
CAROL KERSHAW I had gotten to a pretty good place and what may be, I'll be better. Maybe I'll have gone beyond that. 

00:04:55
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:04:55
CAROL KERSHAW It would be even more interesting. 

00:04:55
LYNN LYONS Okay. Okay. So things have, you, you are having some heart issues. 

00:05:00
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. My husband passed away a year ago in October and then, then I had my kind of Medicare physical and my heart, I was sent to a cardiologist. I have a lifelong murmur but my heart was quite enlarged and that was anxiety purple thing. I chose a cardiologist that I had met at a Sufi psychology conference, so at least he was some what like-minded with me around health issues. Umm… but she decided that I should go on a beta blocker and the universe put all kinds of things in the way that I couldn't get a parking place and the parking lot at a big health complex. Uh… it rained, there was a long line that I couldn't wait. Uh… so I finally filled it but I never took it. Umm… I know, I don't think beta blockers are probably good for someone with her emotions and intuition for instance and uh… and my specialty is sex therapy, when I was in training back around 1980 was with men coming in with erectile difficulties who have just put on beta blockers. So I, they didn't seem like a good thing to me. 

00:06:20
LYNN LYONS So you, you chose, you, you decided that wasn't for you. 

00:06:20
CAROL KERSHAW That's right. 

00:06:25
LYNN LYONS Yeah, and so what did you do instead? 

00:06:25
CAROL KERSHAW I went, I went to an alternative umm… nutritionist acupuncture person that umm… my son who is a chiropractor and since they were in community college together and she's I notice a very intuitive healer and she put me on something called cardiotrophin (ph.) which umm… he says is something like stem cells and it mends your heart and rebuilds your heart and I have been taking, I took quite a lot of it at the beginning and then tapered off on how much I took and another something that I also take a very little bit. I said, is that a beta blocker? You know, are you putting me, yeah, the nutrition beta blocker but uh… I don't think it was. I have done that and umm… well, I just experienced in my body, my heart is a lot smaller. Uh… I have gone through a time of being very heavy hearted. My husband was dying and it was pushing him in the wheelchair and all of this. I read that athletes when they stop being athletes, their hearts go back down and so I really have experience that I'm much more light-hearted. I've gone to a few contrabands things and I, you know, I don't have heart symptoms. I can, you know, exercise in aerobic kind of active way. Uh… and my chest just been much more relaxed and then while I was here, I picked up a phone message that a year has gone by and the cardiologist would like to see me in January. You know, all of a sudden, boom, you know, my chest is tighter. It has not been tight like that. It's been relaxed. It just felt light and then you know, when we were doing this insoluble problem you know, I still my chest is tight. So how perfect that you are here. 

00:08:25
LYNN LYONS How perfect that you are here. 

00:08:25
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:08:25
LYNN LYONS Yes. All right. 

00:08:25
CAROL KERSHAW Because this will be just the right place. 

00:08:30
LYNN LYONS Isn't that nice, isn't that nice. Yeah. Umm… so you sound like you're somebody who is really good at kind of taking care of yourself and figuring things out. 

00:08:45
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, I would say so most of the time. 

00:08:45
LYNN LYONS Yeah, yeah. And, and life threw you some things that were difficult to manage going through the death of your husband and mourning his loss and readjusting to all of that. Yeah ask so what does the future hold for you? 

00:09:05
CAROL KERSHAW My mother lived to a hundred, so I hope that I have a lot of years left. Almost, my grand parents all lived to be older than I am so I have children, grandchildren uh… I've started taking mandolin lessons a few months ago. I played the piano before uh… 

00:09:25
LYNN LYONS Mandolin lessons. 

00:09:30
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:09:30
LYNN LYONS That is totally cool. 

00:09:30
CAROL KERSHAW It is totally cool, actually it is. I live in an apartment in California where there is a quite of lot of people who do like contra dancing and you know, music things. There is even gonna be a world fest music festival near where I live. Yeah. It is totally cool, yeah. 

00:09:50
LYNN LYONS So do you know when this appointment is yet? 

00:09:50
CAROL KERSHAW No, I haven't returned the phone call. I picked it up literally two days ago and I have to. 

00:09:55
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:09:55
CAROL KERSHAW Sometime in January, that's what they said they will schedule it. 

00:10:00
LYNN LYONS Okay. And intend to go. 

00:10:00
CAROL KERSHAW You know, I can feel even talking about that makes my chest kind of ache and my… I intend to go first of all I'm concerned that it is in my medical record at Kaizer which is my health plan that, that I take beta blockers and if I've ever gotten hospitalized they give them to me. So I like because I couldn't make a phone call and get that out of my medical record. Also all alone, I kind of want to go and to show them how, you know, much smaller my heart is and how much light, more light-hearted I am and how much healthier I am and so I imagine going and showing that off but I wonder if this has not put some doubt in what if it's all in my imagination and it's really not true. 

00:10:50
LYNN LYONS Yeah. So you started what if. 

00:10:55
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, I did. 

00:10:55
LYNN LYONS Yes. And are you generally a big what if are or is it just around this particular thing? 

00:11:00
CAROL KERSHAW You know, I think it's a lot, this, this is probably occupied my attention. I have been more aware of my heart during this year than in, in the past but there have been some suggestions about you know, there was one about acne and skin conditions and things in forgetting it here in. I have been good at forgetting for an extended periods of time because I, I don't really experience distress or anything, you know. So I really think that the less I concern myself, well, I think the less it's really going to be or it is, yeah. 

00:11:40
LYNN LYONS Okay, okay. So umm… what is your experience with using hypnotic processes? 

00:11:50
CAROL KERSHAW There are certain people, in fact you're a teacher Yapko. 

00:11:55
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:11:55
CAROL KERSHAW Every time I sit in front of him I am gone. But, but for a lot of people I'm more observing what's going on. But for some reason, he, he has just been one person over the last few years that I have come to these conferences, I just don't know a thing consciously that happened during his sessions. 

00:12:20
LYNN LYONS Yeah. I can relate. 

00:12:20
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:20
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Have you ever done a hypnosis session with somebody? 

00:12:25
CAROL KERSHAW You mean being hypnotized? 

00:12:25
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:12:30
CAROL KERSHAW Oh, my doctor said, psychology, so over the years, I've gone to a lot of hypnosis things, I was in training with someone named Dragone(ph) who did self-acceptance training in San Francisco bay area. So there was a lot of hypnosis going on. 

00:12:45
LYNN LYONS So this is a familiar process. 

00:12:45
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, familiar. 

00:12:45
LYNN LYONS Yeah, yeah. So right now, as you're sitting here. 

00:12:50
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:12:50
LYNN LYONS What's going on in your body? 

00:12:55
CAROL KERSHAW I definitely have tightness in my chest. I mean, because this is in even my every day experience, it's like, this whole thing and talking about. 

00:13:00
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:00
CAROL KERSHAW Appointment everything is really tightening. 

00:13:00
LYNN LYONS Yeah, so it's sort of… 

00:13:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, yeah just all, rather than just breathing freely and I mean that's just not something I'm thinking about. 

00:13:20
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:20
CAROL KERSHAW It's just aches here right now. 

00:13:20
LYNN LYONS Yeah, yeah heart aches. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, would you, would you like to just have a go with this? See what we can do… 

00:13:30
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:13:30
LYNN LYONS Together, you and I? 

00:13:30
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah. 

00:13:35
LYNN LYONS Okay. So if you were going to put yourself into one of those nice trances like Michael does to you without even trying, do you have an idea of how you would do that? 

00:13:45
CAROL KERSHAW Well, I'll probably take my glasses off and close my eyes and then you probably talking something would happen. 

00:13:55
LYNN LYONS Well, then I think we should do that. 

00:13:55
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:13:55
LYNN LYONS All right. So you've taken your glasses off, you've closing your eyes, closing, taking and closing. Now I'm gonna talk and. So go ahead and just set a little, little bit Carol. 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:20
LYNN LYONS And you can begin to pay attention in an interesting way to what it feels like to be sitting in this chair. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:40
LYNN LYONS And you know when I'm listening to you talk and telling me your story, 

00:14:50
[sil.] 

00:14:55
LYNN LYONS When I'm listening to the words that you use, when I'm noticing the expressiveness of your face. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:15
LYNN LYONS The genuineness, 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:25
LYNN LYONS I can't help but to get pulled in. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
LYNN LYONS I can't help but to want to hear more about what you do, about your life, about playing the mandolin, about contra dancing. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
LYNN LYONS About how you bring yourself, how you step in. 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:35
LYNN LYONS And so I'm a little disappointed in this moment but I'm the one who's doing the talking. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:55
LYNN LYONS Because it seems to me. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
LYNN LYONS That you have a lot of resources, a lot to share. 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:20
LYNN LYONS You know this, heart of ours is beating hard. You've already done my work, 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:45
LYNN LYONS you've already used all the metaphors. The heavy heart, the light heart, the big heart, the broken heart, the healing heart. 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
LYNN LYONS And on those expressions. 

00:18:25
[sil.] 

00:18:30
LYNN LYONS Just symbolic. 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:40
LYNN LYONS Of who you are as a whole. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:55
LYNN LYONS So as you're listening to my voice carol, allowing yourself to just enjoy these chairs we're sitting in, 

00:19:15
[sil.] 

00:19:20
LYNN LYONS The ability to just sink in to this experience, 

00:19:30
[sil.] 

00:19:35
LYNN LYONS Is interesting experience where the part, the heart. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:55
LYNN LYONS Becomes the literal metaphor for the whole. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:15
LYNN LYONS Now I know the way that it feels and you know the way it feels. 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:35
LYNN LYONS That's right. When something is looming in front of us is what if. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:55
LYNN LYONS Human beings have this unique capacity to contemplate the future, to think ahead, to plan, to imagine. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:30
LYNN LYONS Chipmunks don't do it, cats don't do it, goldfish don't do it. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
LYNN LYONS And it's a blessing and it's a burden to be able to project ourselves to imagine, to create, to plan, to anticipate. 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
LYNN LYONS Because the trick that our own sophisticated brain plays on us. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:45
LYNN LYONS Is getting us to believe that we imagine, that what we think, that what we plan for is actually what's going to happen. 

00:23:10
[sil.] 

00:23:15
LYNN LYONS Here you and I sit together. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:25
LYNN LYONS And we had a conversation the other day. 

00:23:30
[sil.] 

00:23:35
LYNN LYONS That was full of all sorts of ifs and maybes and so. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:55
LYNN LYONS This summer I had an interesting experience. It's an interesting couple of experiences really. 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:10
LYNN LYONS I was talking with a little eight year old in my office, his name is Timothy and he said, Lynn Lyons, if there was such thing as a time machine, you wouldn't have a job. And I said really, Timothy? He said, yes, you see because then everybody could just jump into their time machine, see what would happen in the future, come back and not have to worry at all. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:24:55
LYNN LYONS I thought that was a pretty astute observation, 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
LYNN LYONS for an eight year old. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:20
LYNN LYONS And then a few weeks later, I was on a plane, flying from Baltimore back to New Hampshire and I was sitting next to a 92 year old woman, 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
LYNN LYONS who struck up a conversation with me and for the short flight, I interviewed her. I peppered her with questions. And I asked her what's the secret of your positive attitude? She said, I could say who cares. My washer broke and my daughter said what are you gonna do mom? And I said, I'm gonna get a new washer, who cares. And she said, I have seven children and six of them are great but one of them is a real pain and every once in a while, he'll decide, he's not gonna talk to me. And I say to him, well, I'm your mother, I'm gonna talk to you. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:50
LYNN LYONS I say, it doesn't bother you that your son is not speaking to you and she says, who cares. He'll come around. How interesting to talk to an eight year old and a 92 year old and to hear the relationship with their future. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:40
LYNN LYONS Now Timothy cared about a lot of things and this 92 year old, she cared about a lot of things too. 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
LYNN LYONS And you Carol, you care about a lot of things. And if only, we had a time machine, where we could together travel to this doctor's appointment and see what would happen? 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
LYNN LYONS What we can. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
LYNN LYONS And so between now and then, your heart is gonna pound a little bit as it should and you might feel a little tightness during those moments when you forget to forget. And when you pick up the phone. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:35
LYNN LYONS or when you find the parking place or when you sit in the waiting room, wonderfully, creative, interesting, connected, mind of yours, 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:10
LYNN LYONS Will dance around from here to there and you'll have thoughts and images and if maybe sowing. 

00:30:30
[sil.] 

00:30:35
LYNN LYONS And wouldn't it be interesting to just allow that expected. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:00
LYNN LYONS Enjoy in an interesting way. 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:10
LYNN LYONS All the different ways, your heart, your heart. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:30
LYNN LYONS has kept you company. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:45
LYNN LYONS If Timothy figures out how to use a time machine, I'm not sure if I want to use it. 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:10
LYNN LYONS I don't know if you knew two years ago, 

00:32:15
[sil.] 

00:32:20
LYNN LYONS That your fingers would be dancing around on a mandolin. 

00:32:30
[sil.] 

00:32:45
LYNN LYONS In a moment, Carol, I'm just going to check in with you. 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:32:55
LYNN LYONS I'm just going to ask you a very simple question and you can respond in a very simple way or very complicated way. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:20
LYNN LYONS I just like to know what's going on inside if you now and if you be willing to share that just nod your head for me. Okay, so when you're ready, go ahead and just let me know. 

00:33:35
CAROL KERSHAW Still aware of my chest. But there is, I think the sensation much more is a release of the tightness and so there is just a lot of energy there but it's not like tight as it was, so there is still quite a bit of sensation that I know my back has loosened up and so all of these is much freer. I love the image who cares, I just, I can imagine going to the appointment and who cares, it is going to the doctor, what's the doctor going to say, good heavens, would think I know so many doctors and I'm related to so many doctors, I wouldn't be so intimidated by this young woman who happens to be an expert in hearts. So I love who cares. That really, it just causes me to have a wave of relaxation. 

00:34:45
LYNN LYONS Good. I wonder if she's an expert in Carol's heart or if maybe that's really your domain. 

00:34:50
CAROL KERSHAW Actually that's my domain. 

00:34:55
LYNN LYONS Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:55
CAROL KERSHAW I realize the power when she said I want, she didn't ask for my consent so much as I want you to take a beta blocker, a small dose of a beta blocker and uh… you know, her own, I guess it's her hypnotic suggestion you know so, I have not taken that beta blocker and so who cares. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:30
LYNN LYONS I agree, I agree. So why don't you take a nice, a nice breath and settle in, no, you can, you can stay with me a little longer, if you want, yeah, yeah. It's fine that you've opened your eyes. 

00:35:45
CAROL KERSHAW I peeked, okay. 

00:35:45
LYNN LYONS You peeked, yeah, I'm still here. 

00:35:50
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:35:50
LYNN LYONS Yeah, and, and the only reason I say that is because you've just given me not surprisingly some wonderful words and ideas and if it's okay with you, I'd like to use your own words and your own ideas as we finish this up. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:25
LYNN LYONS So it's fairly certain, that you're going to be in front of this physician in the near future and I wonder when she says to you Carol, I want you or I'm telling you, I'm going to have you. I wonder if, you can have a little bit of a moment inside, a little bit of a skipping your step as you remember this conversation, as you remember that you've moved forward in so many ways. And I am not going to tell you to loosen up your chest and I am not going to tell you to slow down your heart and I am not going to tell you that as you're sitting in that waiting room that your heart want to be dancing around in your chest. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:30
LYNN LYONS But what I am going to tell you. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:40
LYNN LYONS Is that you not surprisingly feel things and hear things in such a heartfelt way and so of course between now and then, you're gonna have some sensations, some blips, some reminders, some if maybe so, some what ifs, some dancing around. 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:40
LYNN LYONS And I wonder how you'll respond in your own Carol way. I wonder how you'll smile at yourself or roll your eyes a little bit. How you'll talk to yourself. Of course, of course. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:20
LYNN LYONS A few little blips, a few little pauses, a few little moments. Just those moments, forgetting to forget. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
LYNN LYONS Between this and between that. 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
LYNN LYONS You might even begin to look forward to going to this appointment. Just so that you can sit there in that waiting room with that big caring, wonderful Carol. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
LYNN LYONS So take a few moments now and just let yourself absorb what I've said. 

00:41:40
[sil.] 

00:41:45
LYNN LYONS More importantly of course, is what you've said. And when you're ready in a way that's meaningful and make sense to you, you can bring this experience to a close. Take your time and fully reorient yourself when you're ready. 

00:42:15
[sil.] 

00:42:20
LYNN LYONS How are you doing? 

00:42:25
CAROL KERSHAW Really well. 

00:42:25
LYNN LYONS Really well. 

00:42:25
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:42:30
LYNN LYONS Okay. Do you feel like you'd like to take some questions? 

00:42:35
CAROL KERSHAW That'll be fine. 

00:42:35
LYNN LYONS It's up to you. 

00:42:35
CAROL KERSHAW No, I have no problems with that. 

00:42:40
LYNN LYONS Okay, all right. Where is my time person? 11 minutes, how about that. Whoo, yeah, all right. So umm… for those of you who would like to ask questions, you can ask me, you can ask Carol, you can ask to both of us. 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN I just want to make a comment. 

00:43:05
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN That it was so nice for me to see the entire process. It was like being in a therapeutic session and seeing all the different components that they have been, that I have been hearing like for remember to remember and others that don't come to mind right now. So I thank both of you for this wonderful experience and it was just by luck that I ended up here. 

00:43:40
LYNN LYONS It was really just by luck that Carol ended up here too. Hold on, wait for the mic, please. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Hi Carol, I would love to hear umm… just your reflection on that last, that last piece if you would mind checking in with us on your experience? 

00:44:05
CAROL KERSHAW You're referring to after I peeked and then uh… you know, my analytic mind isn't too turned on right now. Uh… but something was added. There was more that, that came in, in that part of it so I was very, very glad that we continued but the same way within that what happen, I'm not thinking that way right now. Yeah. 

00:44:45
LYNN LYONS I, I think that, that what serves as an example is that I, I had no intention at that point or really uh… expectation that Carol would open her eyes. And so when she did, it was a little surprising to me but you know, but, but of course what we know is that interruption sometimes and, and one of the things in terms of learning the what I have over the years of doing this is that when I was first learning how to do this, I was really nervous and worried about talking to the person because I was afraid of interrupting and I was afraid that if they spoke to me that I would get in the way and that what if they opened their eyes or what if they coughed right or what if somebody sneezed or what if they opened their eyes and had a question or what if somebody said, you know, uh… the couch cushion is kind of bumming me. I would huh and really what happens and what Carol has said and what happens over and over and over again is that when people are interrupted and then you go back in, right they, they tend to go deeper. So, so you really if, if you're new to this and you have this idea that the person has to be you know try working with a kid. They don't sit and keep their eyes closed for this long. Umm… but that really actually is, is beneficial, yeah. 

00:46:15
CAROL KERSHAW Do you think there was a motorcycle response? 

00:46:15
LYNN LYONS Yeah, I heard that. 

00:46:15
CAROL KERSHAW Actually, that was beneficial too. 

00:46:20
LYNN LYONS It was. 

00:46:20
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah. Yeah in the, I don't know, it just was, you kind of paused then it happened but it just so, was a distraction and… 

00:46:30
LYNN LYONS Yeah. You all heard the motorcycle. I heard the motorcycle too and in my brain sitting up here, I'm thinking, I could say something like you're just gonna zoom off into life and then my brain said well that would be stupid. 

00:46:45
CAROL KERSHAW See, nothing was perfect. 

00:46:50
LYNN LYONS That was my third option. 

00:46:55
[sil.] 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN So then there was a lovely congruence throughout the entire piece of work. From the introduction when you said, you know, how stupid is it to tell somebody as anxious to calm down and then you begin with the question about six months from now when you look back and so you're origin it towards a positive future and then you… You know, you begin with the story of Timothy and you know that juxtapose with the who cares. And then you move further down in the work and you're talking about if you would have known two years ago and you paused for a significant period of time and she shared that she, that she lost her husband a year ago and, and then you went to, that your fingers would be dancing on the mandolin and so the wave you just from the beginning said, wait, we can anticipate negative stuff, it's gonna happen. Go with it, it's okay and the congruence between the question, the story and that pause and then the option of not what many of us expect might come up. It was just masterful really very nice, thank you. 

00:48:05
LYNN LYONS Oh, thank you. 

00:48:05
CAROL KERSHAW You know, I, you mentioned losing my husband. I, I noticed that there was just a little pear, just at the very like in my eyelashes from the very beginning, no flow, I mean but just that probably there is some grief in my heart though. Of course, there is, you know. Yeah. 

00:48:30
LYNN LYONS And I think, I think to that Rob, one of the things that it was clear in talking to Carol is that she is moving through her grief and she didn't sit down here and say to me, I need to work through the grief with my husband and so that may have been the thing, you know, if somebody, if you're working with somebody and they say, I lost my husband a year ago, we think, oh, well that's right, you know, but that's not what Carol wanted to talk about. Yeah. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN That's interesting because and the way you took in very different direction to highlight. It just makes stuff and it's not we'll mess in this whole thing. 

00:49:15
LYNN LYONS Right. 

00:49:15
CAROL KERSHAW And I think it's very interesting that I had that medical appointment at a point in time where I did where I have been maybe not quite three months after he, he died and that my heart, you know, was larger and heavy and because there have been over a year heavy hearted time, you might say and so in some ways, I am curious because I truly believe my heart is not that large now and not as heavy and you can see I think the fear is what if it really is, you know. But I think it's not. We won't go there, who cares. 

00:49:50
LYNN LYONS We won't, who cares. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:50:00
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Yeah, anything else? All right, well, I so appreciate you for doing this. I so appreciate this. Thank you all for coming. If you want to hear more about what I do, you can call me over to where somebody says I'm supposed to go, Regency. Umm… and so I appreciate you being here. Thank you so much.
