Ana Mari Cauce, Ph.D. Videotaped at the National Multicultural Conference and Sum January 27-28, 2011 Is Multicultural Psychology A-Scientific? REFLECTIONS IN FOUR ACTS ANA MARI CAUCE 

00:00:25
This morning we are very, very pleased with happening to secure Dr. Ana Mari Cauce was extremely busy and (inaudible ) before I come over here, who is the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington. Earl. R Carlson Professor of Psychology, Professor of American Ethnic studies and Adjunct Professor of Women Studies and Dr. Cauce earned her Ph.D. from Yale University in 1981 Psychology and she has over 90 publications and (inaudible ) and she has uh… earned over 17 national research grants to do the work that she is most interested in and (inaudible ). So focusing a lot on risk and resilient processes among the youth or working with homeless youth, working with substance use and abuses among youth with an emphasis on migration of ethnic minority youth. She is a fellow of book the American Psychological Science Association and the association for psychological science and she has been… she has earned the (inaudible ) Taylor award and the (inaudible )_ excellence in research award. We are very honored to have with us this morning Dr. Ana Mari Cauce.

Just press the button. Okay, great. 

00:01:40
DR. ANA MARI CAUCE Thank you, uh… it’s a great honor for me to be here and as you know I am from University of Washington and Seattle has been my home for about 25 years now. So I very much wanna welcome you to my city and I hope you get a chance to get around and enjoy it. It really is wonderful, the weather isn't dier(ph), you know little bit of grey is good for you. Umm… We actually are when I first came to Seattle uh… I you know it… it seemed a little pale to me uh… but I’ve got to say that we… we recently had the honor of we have the most diverse zip code in the country, and it’s just a little bit south, so we actually are a very good place for a multicultural conference. Umm… and I am going to address the question “Is multicultural psychology A-scientific?” Well what I start working with my graduates students I often tell them that over the next four, five, six maybe seven years umm… there task will be as much to unlearn as to learn. We spend much of our time particularly in our undergraduate years, attempting to master a field to know things, to get to the answers, but becoming a good research psychologist or a good clinical psychologist is not so much about answering questions, but about learning how to ask good questions. In fact I can tell my students the answer to about 90% of the questions that they’ll ever encounter in our field, it depends. So of course that’s the answer to the question today, “Is multicultural psychology A-scientific?” Well it depends. It depends on how you define psychological science and it depends on how you define multicultural psychology and it depends on where you sight the intersection between these two. So today I am going to organize my talk in four sections. 

00:03:55
Act 1: What is Multicultural Psychology? Act 2: What is Psychological Science? Act 3: Are Multicultural Psychology and Science Incompatible? Act 4: The Promise of Multicultural Psychology: How do we get from here to there? 

00:03:55
DR. ANA MARI CAUCE If they are acts in a play, the first two would be the set up, the third is where the confrontation takes place and in the fourth, I hope for a resolution of source. Or to be more specific in the first and second, I’ll provide the definitions my definitions of science and multicultural psychology obviously someone else could define them in different ways and come up with a different answer. Then I am going to answer the question which I think is at the base of what I have been asked to address, which is are these two incompatible? Is multipsychol… multicultural psychology and the science incompatible and in other words I’ll try to explain why the question I’ve been asked to address is an interesting one. Then to cut to the climax right away, I’ll let you know that I disagree with those who pass(ph) it incompatibility. Umm… I believe it’s perfectly possible and consistent to answer the question with a yes so, I’ve kind of given a way the talk at the beginning, but you know I hope you will stay with me as I build(ph) to that conclusion. Fourth and finally to take advantage of this fabulous bully pop that you’ve handed me, I am going to pontificate a bit on where I think this new and exciting field of multicultural psychology should be going and how we should get there. And I am going to make the case that science should very much be at the center of this endeavor. 

00:05:30
Act 1: What is Multicultural Psychology? 

00:05:30
DR. ANA MARI CAUCE What is Multicultural Psychology? Act 1. I am not going to presume to develop my own definition. I am simply going to steal from my colleague to the South Gordon Hall(ph) and I will use the same definition as he and it's pretty much a definition that's been used by almost anyone in this field. According to Hall(ph) in his text multicultural psychology, “Multicultural Psychology is American psychology or be it a part of American psychology that’s often been neglected.” Hall's text as well as the other key volumes in the field stress that multicultural psychology has a special emphasis or focus on American cultural or ethnic groups of people which we often call people of color. They’d have been relatively neglected by more mainstream psychology. To take it a step further, multicultural psychology focuses on cultural diversity within these already diverse groups of folks. So the focus is on diversity. So far there is nothing to suggest a necessarily strange relationship between multicultural psychology and psychological science. All you have to do would be to broaden psychological science to include in its subject pool, people who hadn't been included in the past, no I mean it isn't that easy, well maybe, but maybe not quite so easy. For Hall(ph) also states that multicultural means not only multiple cultures, but multiples ways of knowing, multiple world views and whereas the assumption in traditional psychology is it theories and researchers generalizable, the assumption in multicultural psychology is that there are both universal and cultural specific phenomenon and the emphasis is on the latter, on the cultural specific phenomenon and there in at least maybe lies the rub or the tention. Multicultural psychology at least is defined by key texts in the field, does not seek to overthrow traditional psychological science, if you look at Hall's(ph) text or any of the other texts, they include a section on quantitative research methods even on biological psychology, but there is a clear emphasis on context and culture and just as importantly the emphasis is on complexity rather than on parsimony. So I think that tomorrows key note speaker Joseph Gone(ph) is going to be discussing in much more detail the complexity involved in defining and working with culture. So I am just going to wish him good luck and I am going to punt on that one. Umm… But the idea that multicultural psychology isn't only about studying different people, but on studying different contract… constructs including those that might be culturally specific rather than universal, does raise some interesting questions for psychological science and so I will go to Act 2. What is Psychological Science? 

00:09:05
ACT 2: What is Psychological Science? 

00:09:05
DR. ANA MARI CAUCE As we might remember from our days in psychology one-o-one and it’s a course, I teach aversion of that every summer to incoming freshmen so it’s a lot of fun to see what they are expecting to get. Then I tell them that psychic means so, okay which was later expanded to include the totality of all psychic experiences, all psychic processes including conscious and unconscious thought. With an eventual focus on the mind and even later when we started focusing on just observables, the birth of behaviorism, the focus turned on behavior. Now of course all of you know that as FMRI and other techniques have allowed us to observe the brain or the mind directly, the block… the black box is been opened and we go for circle, but that’s an another talk. I am gonna go back to the 16th and 17th century for a moment and to the kinds of questions that early physiologists were most interested in. What is fundamental nature of mankind and they did include women in that but just didn’t use the word. Umm… How does the mind work in concert with the body? Those were the questions that the early proto psychologists were interested in and at least in the western world these were viewed as being in the province of religion or God. If you wanted to know about man’s failed nature, all you had to do was read the creation story in the bible. But then intellectual forces associated with the resonance, French revolution, later the American revolution led to the age of the enlightenment which changed all that. There is no one school of thought that can be called enlightenment, but it's as much as set of values than it is about a set of believes. And Keido(ph) enlightenment thought was a shift away from divine wide as the source of legitimacy and authority to an emphasis on reason and logic. In his famous 1784 essay “What is enlightenment?” A manual con simply stated that at its essence the enlightenment was about being free to use one's intelligence. So the question psychologists were interested in, moved out of religion and into philosophy in difference to time and to your patients or cut across a broad swath 100 of years and almost as many intellectual movements and simply know that what philosophy and science were closely bound to each other almost until the midpoint of the 18th century, around this time they began to diverge and there was natural philosophy which later became natural science, which focused very distinctly and very clearly on defining the laws of nature. This was really the birth of science as we think of it today, and by the 19th century the study of science, the study of natural laws was almost exclusively referred to a science. Science was seen as a disciplined way of studying the natural world. Drawing especially on the work of Francis Bacon, science was defined by the combination of logic and careful and precise measurement and it was believed that through logic and precise measurement we could get a truth. Truths that would be unchanging, absolute and transcend it. Science became closely aligned with empiricism and positivism. In essence science became one and the same as a scientific method and it wasn't enshrined in the four canons of science: Determinism, Empiricism, Parsimony and Testability. 

00:13:35
Four Canons of Science DETERMINISM All consequences have a cause EMPIRICISM Only questions that can be answered with OBSERVABLE data are appropriate PARSIMONY Simpler is better Occam's Razor TESTABILITY Theories should be falsifiable (a menable to be proven false) 

00:13:35
DR. ANA MARI CAUCE These methods as enshrined in the canons of Science were most clearly illustrated in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology and geology and maybe, just maybe psychology. Seems to a question we are asking these days in any case. After all the emphasis on laws of nature could include human nature and factors are fairly peculiar western way to even to ever think that they can be divided and with physiology’s new focus on human behavior, human nature could be measured and observed. And it was very important at this time they were some battles and eventually there was a conclusion that odd(ph) no measurement was okay so questionnaires weren't appropriate technique to use. I will talk a little bit more about psychological science as a social science when I get to the fourth act, but I think that when we ask, “Is multicultural psychology A-scientific?” We are implicitly referring to this positive empirical natural science I've just described, so at least that's what I am gonna talk about when I addressed the question, “Is multicultural psychology science?” I am referring to this positivist empirical natural science. So now I move on to Act 3, but not before saying that all though we can and I think in Joe's(ph) talk, he will focus on the role that science has played in oppressing people of color or anyone not in a position of power and rightfully so it's a talk I could give and in fact that I have given to other audiences at other times, I think it’s also very important not to forget science as early a man supporter(ph) impulses and roles. By focusing on reason and on logic it meant that ordinary man and woman didn't have to rely on God or on her priests or on kings and their divine rights for truth or knowledge, he or she could find it him or herself and that’s pretty cool. And I think that's pretty progressive. So you know I really think it's important we often tend to view science as in particularly people of color as potentially a force of oppression and I really want us to remember the degree to which it freed us from kings and priests and God in that you know everything coming from… from down to our sort of way. So Act 3; Are Multicultural psychology and Science Empirical/Positivist Science Incompatible? 

00:16:35
Act 3: Are Multicultural psychology and (Empirical/Positivist) Science Incompatible? 

00:16:35
ANA MARI CAUCE Well when I was first asked to address this topic I was reminded of a talk that I gave my second summer here in Seattle, when I was still an assistant professor. It was in 1988 in Chicago and the conference was called researching community psychology integrating theories, methods and practice. We’ve been dealing with this integration issue for quite a while. Its focus was on and I quote, some of the crucial issues facing community research, Epistemological issues, the nature and the relationship between the researcher and the researched and so forth. The talk of the day was on how to develop newer improved and of course sexier reforms of what we called then adventurous some research. Umm… I describe the tenure of the conference discussions, I was a discussant at that time and I was there presenting the junior psychologist perspective and so I described the tenure of the conference as logical positivism bashing. And that’s an impulse I sometimes feel strongly in multicultural psychology circles as well. For example in a postmodern psychology of Asian-Americans, creating knowledge of a racial minority by Laura Uba and this is a wonderful engaging deconstruction a swamp through the short comings of empirical science. She notes in her conclusion that we psychological and multicultural sciences… scientist have been hand cuffed by modernist methods. Both community psychology in 1988 and post-modern Asian-American psychology in 2002, drive their critics… draw their critics of empirical, traditional, modernist psychological science from the scholarship of the science wars of the 1990s. And these were series of intellectual battles between scientific realists and post-modernist critics generally identified with cultural studies, cultural anthropology, feminist studies and comparative literature. And they questioned the scientific objectivity (inaudible ) of the scientific method. Those who are the (inaudible ) part out of the disappointment with big science and technology and some of its uses or abuses. These uses and abuses included nuclear war, environmental degradation and so forth, but it also grew out of a sense of discomfort with sciences cold hard view of humans and their emotions and to put it bluntly science came off as cold and uninspiring. Look at us now, we live in a world awash with technology which are the applied fruits of our science and I sometimes wonder is this really progress? You know exactly what I mean, or there is a book it’s actually just coming out this week by Sherry Turkle who is a psychologist, sociologist at MIT, and I think its title is wonderfully descriptive of something that I think we’re all kind of wondering about an experiencing. The title of the book is “Alone Together.” Why we expect more from technology and less from each other? And so you know we kind of wonder, you know we have this kind of anxiety, the science taking us where we wanna go is it making us those of us that are psychologists more human is it making in our interactions richer or is it in fact you know creating spaces where we don't interact in ways that are real and genuine. Umm… but some of the science wars also arose from the fact that is the realization hid home harder and harder that in these United States, for these discussions about multicultural psychology really are fairly North America base when we talk about ethnic groups, we largely I mean I actually think our field needs to become more transnational, but again that’s a different talk. Umm… We no longer live in a homogenous world, but in one where people differ from each other in ways that are important and no it’s not just like blue eyes and brown eyes, that the ways in which we differ are important. Differences which its believed that in the quest for enduring and generalizable and universal truths, the modernist methods of science gloss over these important differences. Truth is we have been too long a psychology who's proto typical subjects are white rats and white college students. I don’t think there is a whole lot of question about that one. So multicultural psychology is incompatible with the psychological science that’s narrow in its methods and at the extreme end of positivism in a epistemological grounding. There is no question that to better understand, accessed study and appropriately intervened in our richly multicultural world will require us to draw upon a broader and more diverse array of methods and epistemologies than those that can be found in the most reductionist portrayals of science. As an immigrant, Latina, lesbian and feminist, I am all too aware of how an narrowly positivist view of science and the way it reifies the myth of the scientist as a neutral and objective observer has helped to maintain and to legitimize a society is far from neutral in its characterization and treatment of people of color and of women and of sexual minorities and of those not born in the US and I could go on. Yet my fear is it in our portrayal of traditional science and its positivist triangle hold, we’ve created a straw man for empiricism more generally and for attempts at precise measurement and study of real world problems in the laboratory and I would find that very-very regrettable and that's where I part company with those who would push psychology in post-modernist directions and away from science. and I would really urge you who think those of you who might be wondering can you really capture important real world issues with precise measurement in laboratories to attend the talk that Tony Greenwald is going to give about prejudice umm… that is prototypical science at it is best and I think the work that’s going on there and with his group is very-very important. I am also equally concerned that we are blaming traditional scientific methods and epistemologies for problems that are instead the fault of problematic sociological or demographic character of virtually all academic and professional enterprises in this country. In other words the fault isn't with science, it’s with the makeup of scientist or at least part of the problem is. Well I don’t believe that is possible for anyone to succeed in being truly objective, I am not convinced that isn't something we were striving for, or some would put it crudely, someone said this to one of my students I wasn't pleased, she wasn't pleased, but there's a kernel of truth here. We should strive to do research not just me-search. And given the still very small number of people of color or those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are involved in producing psychological science, we need to be extremely careful about emphasizing methods where researchers don't even strive for objectivity. I have no doubt that we will solve the question of people of color and psychological science, it’s just a matter of where our country is growing, some of us breath faster than them, not me personally, but… but the issue of socioeconomic class I think is always gonna be a vexing one and its inherent to any occupation that requires a lengthy (inaudible ). So let’s go to Act 4; The Promise of Multicultural Psychology and how do we get there from here. 

00:25:50
Act 4: The Promise of Multicultural Psychology: How do we get from here to there? 

00:25:50
ANA MARI CAUCE Well I completed my dissertation more than a quarter century ago, I had trouble getting it published in a APA mainstream journal, because I'd used an all African-American sample and the editors had questions about the generalizabilty of those results. Of course the question would have wouldn't have been asked if it was a white sample. Okay we know that, umm… but what if the questions we need to ask ourselves as we build the multicultural psychology is whether we wanna be able to conclude from those studies. Do we want to say that neither study either one with an all black sample are all or one with an all white sample can lead to generalizable conclusions, how do we want to say they both can? I am gonna suggest that we wanna say yes, and no in both cases. That is we wanna leave room for multicultural psychologists to carry out studies that are meant to apply to a segmented sample and to only that sample. For example if my goal is to design an intervention to deal with school dropouts among Mexican Americans, I don't need to strive for truths that are more universal that are beyond that group and this shouldn't be seen as a lesser form of research. At the same time I wouldn't want anybody much less a multicultural psychologist to assume that just because the study was carried out with a homogenous population, rather Mexican-American or white, that it necessarily hold no universal truths. And there is two reasons for that. First if we take this view to its logical conclusion, we get into a reductionism of a whole different sort. On that would close the doors, to access in any real or at least useful form of truth or knowledge that is culture ethnicity is not the only important distinction between people. So if a study conducted in non-white sample necessarily tells us nothing about Mexican Americans, then a study of Mexican American, women necessarily tells us nothing about Mexican American men. And a study of Mexican American rich men tells us nothing about Mexican American poor man. And a study of Mexican American poor straight man tells nothing about Mexican American poor gay men. I think you get my dearth there. Okay. It just… you know that kind of way of looking at things really doesn't work for us and I mean by that people of color. Second, part of why I am so excited about reading the results of studies carried out with non-traditional samples is in fact they often lead to differ deeper understandings of traditional samples that we already thought we understood. One especially good example comes from the work of Carol Gilligan on women and moral development. Work that it been concluded by Larry Colberg, on solely privileged white man in fact a sample where all college men in Harvard, led him to conclude that the highest stages of moral development required us to privilege moral decisions that were based on notions of individual rights and rules, that this meant that you are at a higher developmental stage then if you base your decisions on thinking about how they would affect your human relationships, but Gilligan saw something different in her work with women. But what I think is especially cool about it is that it lead people to rethink how we looked at men and over time we began to see that men also thought about human relationships in decision making and that had played a much bigger role with men than we’d ever thought of when we just studied men. So this look at women actually helped us understand men. In fact when I am in my academic role, one of things that’s you know I am really trying to do in my college is to urge all our students to study abroad. And the reason for that isn't just that I want them to have a greater appreciation of another culture, because I think that in doing that we will be able to better understand their own. Answers aren’t always yes and no, sometimes they really are dialectic, yes and no. We can't say that its good for a scientist to strive towards objectivity well being fully aware that he or she cannot ever achieve it. We can't say that science has a universal mission without assuming that we live or we’ll ever live or there it would be good to live in a world that’s gender, color or otherwise blind. Building a multicultural science or workforce, building a science which accurately represents our multicultural world is not the same as creating a new type of multicultural science that's fundamentally separate from the science that sprung from the renaissance or enlightenment. Moreover privileging what knowledge is of most worth in science is not the same as denying the value of other forms of knowledge, one can’t support a epistemological pluralism, one can support epistemological pluralism without destroying science. Some multicultural work maybe science as we think of science, in the natural sciences and some may not be. As I was writing in a conclusion to this talk on a drizzly Sunday afternoon, Lisa and I were emailing back and forth, I was sitting in my office looking out at the now blossom list, but still majestic cherry trees twisting branches against the muted gray sky, I couldn't help but think about a conference I attended a very years back in Kyoto, where I was first exposed to the writings of C. P. Snow and his notion of two cultures; one a culture of science and the other a culture of the humanities, broadly defined so as to include the qualitative social sciences. Well Snow's dichotomies perspective is way too simplistic to capture the cacophony of discourses presented in today's humanistic, social sciences and natural science disciplines, there is no denying the two often are (inaudible ), these disciplines while sharing the same or contiguous spaces all to seldom engage in meaningful dialogues about the big problems of our times, problems that whether environmental, political or social often disproportionately impact people of color and one could use the sinology of two cultures quite frankly, to talk about research and practitioners as well. Doing this talking across cultures doesn't come naturally. Our culture is not only different in their epistemologies and methods, but they also address very different types of problems. In science knowledge is cumulative one more brick in the edifice, standing on the shoulders of giants, but it is also the opposite, and science you try to destroy the past in order to build new paradigms, a new foundation for a new edifice, a giant leap, not a steady climb. This can lead to a (inaudible ) historical stance or it seem more (inaudible ) one of my mentors, mentored in his 1978 paper, the nature of problem solving in a social action. If a study was done 50 years ago it's obviously irrelevant. Science is on an upward and onward trajectory. In the same paper Saracen points to the work of Richard Nelson, a pioneer in evolutionary economics who wrote an book of 70s, a book in the 70s so clearly it’s not relevant any more. That was called the “Moon in the Ghetto” and the title referred to the question we asked ourselves at that time, if you can send the man to the moon why can't you solve the problems of poverty, here on earth. It's original less poetic title was more descriptive. It was a study of the current malice of rational analysis of social problems, and in it Nelson notes that in social sciences and humanities certain problems are innately intractable. By intractable he means not solvable in the once and for all you don't have to solve that again passion, that is so typical of science. So in science (inaudible ) people who say problems are intractable, but in the room of social science and social action (inaudible ) people who say the problems are tractable. In dealing with social problems the kinds that interest us most here we need to be aware that we are all regardless of our background very biased and very time bound organisms. We must also come to grips with human imperfectability and this is a level of humility not always helpful to someone who is trying to decode the human genome or trying to understand the genesis of human consciousness. Talking across cultures is the most difficult type of dialogue, but people of color have a huge stake in this enterprise. We break from science that are own peril. When poor understandings of science, if not outright pseudo or junk science takes hold in the public imagination, it can lead to more… it can lead to poor and misguided public policy, public policy that's most apt to hurt us. For example at this Kyoto conference there was a CEO who talked about global warming having winners and losers, you know he taught that those of us of north and Washington, Idaho and Montana would become Texas in California. He also assumed that was good, but that's another… that's a whole other discussion, but like so many others his basic understanding of climate change was a mile wide in entity and at the same conference I met with a small group of journalist who were talking about how their belief that there was always at least two equally legitimate viewpoints in every debate, made it very difficult for them to identify when the scientific community had reached consensus about climate change, because of this mistaken notion about how science works because they didn't understand that science converges on truth. They were reporting that climate change was still contested way after scientist had largely agreed that this was a problem and that delayed action on a very urgent problem and it probably cost us precious time, time that our children and grandchildren will be paying for. There are consequences to just yanking the pedestal out from science and let’s not forget the strange bed fellows we make when we refudiate science. Enough said. I don't wanna exaggerate the chasm between the two cultures, I think actually Snow did exaggerate them. What I love about psychology, a discipline that is truly poised with one foot in the natural sciences and one in the social sciences is that you don't have to choose one set of methods or tools over another. Given the enormity of problems facing us as people and even more so as people of color we’d be true fools if we've started any endeavor by throwing tools out of our toolkit because we don't like the history of how they were fashioned or because we don't like the ethnic biases of who fashioned them. Methodological approaches… approaches that highlight experimental control in rigor may well enjoy more academically prestigious venues for publication and that might well piss some of us off. Yet methodological approaches and methodological different approaches are also evident in our scientific endeavors. My own heroes of psychology and my academic fathers and in my case they were fathers, have never allowed themselves to be constricted by anyone paradigm as is been the case in the physical and natural sciences. Neither community nor multicultural psychology are fields lacking creative ideas or complex contextually sensitive insights glean from value driven and politicized (inaudible ). I have not seen that as problem in the field. Inner play between control, careful and precise experimental methods and quasi experimental qualitative and less intrusive approaches are not only desirable, they are essential to advance in our knowledge about cultural and multicultural phenomenon. Just as there is no specific theory that is in all cases more desirable, more morally superior or a best expression of our research questions, the same is true of methods. These dialogues across divides, I talk about them as border crossings are not only of academic input, they are crucial in finding applications that address are most vexing problems. As we meet here in Seattle, we sit in the epicenter for work on global health and there are parallels between the health problems that plague people of color within this country and those that affect our non diasporas(ph) sisters and brothers outside the U.S. and this respect is important to know that while the ultimate cure for HIV will likely come from scientific innovation, our growing understanding of how to motivate behavioral change much of it (inaudible ) from qualitative social science research is our greatest tool for saving lives in the present and this level of behavioral change needs and needed to be shaped by our understandings of the specifics of culture and of how gender plays out in culture. The same is going to be the case if we do get to a vaccine and I believe we will. Once that vaccine or drug is developed we will find the same need to understand culture and gender in a specific way will be important in figuring out distribution and compliance in terms of taking the medication. In our battle for diabetes which is becoming increasingly common at earlier and earlier ages and which disproportionately affects people of color, significant change will occur as we learn more about the genomics of the disease. No question. But to make true progress we also need to better understand ethnic and social class disparity… disparities and access to healthy food to safe places to exercise and a quality healthcare. The same need to triangulate our various forms of knowledge will be called into play as we move toward mitigating the effects of climate change. We will need our social science to inform how we go about shaping wide scade… wide scale behavior change, here are also meeting in the recycling capital of the world umm… and behavioral change that emphasizes conservation. We will need our very best scientific tools to help us discover and create new and different sources of energy, but we are also gonna need our social science to help us inform behavioral change. How do you get people to feel comfortable driving in smaller cars? How do you get people to recycle and so forth and yes you’ll notice that I am perfect… that I am purposefully giving examples that are more than about mental health. Now that’s not because I don't think mental health is of critical importance, (inaudible ) certainly showed us that, but I also think we need to think broader. Our efforts as multicultural psychologist are required in many to deal with many-many-many critical issues that disproportionately affect people of color. Health issues, issues about the environment all of those are areas where I think our knowledge can be helpful. We can and should bring this collective knowledge to bear on the most pressing questions of our times in ways that happened to our potential across epistemological and methodological divides. We must not be naïve about the real limits of collaboration, but we should not let that keep us from thinking bigger and bolder rather than smaller and narrower. On the last day of the conference in Kyoto which I actually went to as representative of my university where I met incredibly smart people there were seven Noble… Noble Prize winners there. Umm… and I’d been thinking a lot at this conference because of was its themes one of its themes about the chasm between scientific and humanistic perspectives. And on that last day I woke up at about 4 am due to jetlag, I’d done almost no tourism because I’d been going to the sessions and so I decided to go on the road headed to Nanzenji temple, a little after dark. It’s one of the important and famous Zen temples in the world. Its surrounded by gardens, ponds and a very small, but very beautiful dry walk garden. I was virtually alone there for the first hour and the mist and drizzle of a light rain brought on a contemplative mood. I left the temple via the philosophers path, about a mile and half long stroll along a small stream surrounded by cherry trees, well pass the bloom and Japanese maple leaves that were about to turn, although at moments the city encroached and you could hear the traffic just a block or so away, it was mostly peaceful and quiet and both the temple and path had the feeling of being in the country and untamed and untrammeled nature. But upon closer inspection, the power of the human hand was apparent and precise twisting of the tree branches, the rocks had been raked and the fish in the pond were not native. Having spent two days in a conference whose theme was harmony with nature, talking about lots of very important issues, never once that I better understand or have a better appreciation of exactly what was met about the interplay of the humanistic perspectives and of the scientific perspectives then on that walk inspired by the aesthetics of the setting and the echoes of an ancient culture where beauty, poetry and spirituality were so evidently reflected in their approach to the natural which in fact was not so natural. Sometimes the answers are yes and no. I attended the closing session of the conference with a heightened sense of urgency for the task ahead of us and of the moral human social aesthetic and scientific dimensions of problems that matter. The conversations throughout the conference and form the conversation ahead in my head throughout the walk, the conversation on the walk in turn informed my conversation at the conference at the closing. Each way of knowing and experiencing, enriched the other. So in closing I wanna point out that I am not unaware of my place in the hierarchy of power. I am a winner, some not so kindly might even say I am a sellout but I am tenured… I am a full professor, I am a Dean. I often joke with my students that if I ever write a memoir it’s gonna be called, “How I became a straight white man.”

DR. ANA MARI CAUCE What can I say, and I know that winners tend to think that the rules of the game are fare and they have little to gain from shattering the status quo or from drastic shifts in paradigms. But I do take some solace in the fact that I said some of the same things I have said today, a quarter century ago at a time when (inaudible ) were getting out (inaudible ) student loans was at best a glimmer in my eye. So in closing I am going to power phrase my earlier self. The possibility of (inaudible ) forming our research enterprises in ways that are more humane, ecologically valid, culturally valid and empowering as exciting, but I would urge caution and humility in the face of the enormous challenges before us, and maybe time to ask ourselves a series of questions posed by Donna Haraway, a historian of science coded by Sandra Harding, a feminist philosopher of science. Here I am gonna substitute the word multicultural where before I used… I’d used the word community and where Donna Haraway had used the word feminist. Is there a specifically multicultural theory of knowledge which is analogues in its implications to theories which were the heritage of Greek science and of the scientific revolution of the 17th century? What a multicultural epistemology in forming scientific (inaudible ) be a family member to existing theories of representation and philosophical realism? Or should multicultural psychologist adapt the radical form of the epistemology that denies the possibility of access to a real world and to an objective stand point? One multicultural standards of knowledge genuinely end the dilemma of the cleavage between subject and object or between non-invasive knowing and prediction and control. Does multicultural psychology offer insight into the connections between science and humanism? Does multicultural psychology have anything new to say about the vexed relations between knowledge and power. Would multicultural authority empowered a name give the world a new identity, a new story? I think that its only by working with our fullest diversity of theories, research, methods and researchers that we will be ever be able to answer any of these questions with a yes. Thank you.
