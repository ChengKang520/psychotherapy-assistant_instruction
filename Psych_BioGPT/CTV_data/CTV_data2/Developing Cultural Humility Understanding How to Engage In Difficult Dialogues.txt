MIGUEL GALLARDO Hi my name is Miguel Gallardo, I am an Associate Professor of Psychology at Pepperdine University's Graduate School of Education & Psychology. Thank you for taking the time to watch the video series Developing Cultural Humility, Understanding How to Engage in Difficult Dialogues. The purpose of these videos is to demonstrate and to hopefully facilitate more authentic and genuine multi-cultural dialogs and relationships. As I reflect on where we are in the year 2013, I continue to remain deeply concerned about our ability to engage in multi-cultural dialogs that create better understandings about individuals whose world views may differ from our own. There are many in this country who are seduced by the illusion that the election of President Obama signified a post racial society that our concerns about racism, discrimination, oppression and injustices of all kinds all of a sudden had no credibility. However, research, political and institutional policies and current societal attitudes indicate and paint a very different picture. 

00:01:35
Population growth in United States is fastest 

00:01:35
among devalued communities 

00:01:35
In 2012, 50.4% of American children under 

00:01:35
the age of 1 belonged to devalued groups. 

00:01:35
In 2011, people of color made up 36.2% of 

00:01:35
the US population. 

00:01:35
(16.7% Hispanic or Latino Origin, 13.1% black, 

00:01:35
5.0% Asian, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska 

00:01:35
Native Persons, and .2% Native Hawaiian and 

00:01:35
Other Pacific Islander Persons) 

00:01:35
MIGUEL GALLARDO In fact there are many who argue that as historically and more currently devalued communities begin to represent larger segments of the population, our focus on equity in quality and to advocate for the elimination of injustices to those with the least amount of power in society should remain central in all that we do as educators, researchers, and providers of services. Interestingly enough, many have stated that we have substituted more overt forms of racism for more covert forms, which I would agree with. But as ethnocultural communities continue to develop a stronger presence in this country, a backlash is occurring whereby fear and desperation become the driving forces behind maintaining the status quo, leaving those already in control and power intact. 

00:02:20
Hate Crime Statistics 

00:02:20
Currently, 1,007 known hate groups operate across the country, 

00:02:20
including neo-Nazis, Klansmen, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, 

00:02:20
racist skinheads, black separatists, border vigilantes and others. 

00:02:20
Since 2000, the number of hate groups has increased by 67 percent. 

00:02:20
The number of Patriot groups, including armed militias, has grown 

00:02:20
813 percent since President Obama was elected - from 149 in 2008 

00:02:20
to 1,360 in 2012. 

00:02:20
In 2011, 1,944 law enforcement agencies reported 6,222 hate crime 

00:02:20
incidents involving 7,254 offenses.

MIGUEL GALLARDO Ultimately, at least from my perspective, more overt forms of racism are occurring more and more today with increasing hate crimes targeting ethnocultural communities calling into question affirmative action policies, legislative policies, perpetuating any qualities and injustices and demonstrating that while some progress has been made, the question still remains how far have we really come. The video series on developing cultural humility are an outgrowth of a recent book I edited on this very subject area while I invited white psychologists to write about their personal and professional journeys towards centralizing multi-cultural and social justice issues and all they do. Similarly, I invited psychologists to represent historically devalued communities to reflect on these journeys and to write about their own journeys and to discuss the value in engaging in more cross-cultural dialogs.

MIGUEL GALLARDO In essence, it is my hope that the book and these videos help us learn and understand how we can better situate ourselves in difficult dialogs, particularly at times when we are offended, don't feel like belong in the conversation and simply do not have the energy to continue. The dialogs contain in these videos are simply intended to inform viewers how to think about enhancing our capacity to engage in dialogs, while hopefully creating relationships that facilitate growth beyond our current state of paralysis. Whether you are a counselor, an administrator, a professor or a student, my hope is to engender a more authentic and sincere understanding and appreciation for those whose world views, multiple social identities and lived experiences maybe different from our own. Obviously, from my perspective, it is critical that we continue to find ways to invite more people into our multi-cultural conversations, create the space for conversations to occur, which hopefully serve as a launching pad beyond outdated modes of thinking that simply perpetuate the status quo. It is my belief that everyone including my white colleagues and students must be intimately involved in our multi-cultural dialogs for us to engender a sense of connectedness to these issues and to begin to breakdown the us versus them mentality.

MIGUEL GALLARDO There is an ancient Mayan greeting called In Lak'ech Ala K'in, I Am You and You Are Me. In Spanish, it is best represented as tú eres mi otro yo, you are my other me. It is at this place where we must situate our future dialogs and encounters, we must always recognize ourselves and other people. If I recognize myself in you, I am less likely to do harm to you and more likely to respect you. We are all working including those of us from historically and currently devalued communities. We must all remain diligent in our efforts to create and sustain more difficult dialogs. Each video in this series includes a dialog with my colleagues who also contributed to the book. The videos include an opportunity for them to continue their dialog and to engage in ways that writing a book capture does not allow. Each video contains the unique perspectives and personal experiences from the contributing authors about their personal and professional journeys, what sustains their commitment to multi-cultural issues, creating dialog with others and most importantly recommendations for us as we think about doing the same. In video 1, you are going to hear from doctors Rebecca Toporek and Patricia Arredondo. They are going to have a conversation about their personal experiences and ways in which they have sustained their commitment to engaging in difficult dialogs. I asked both of them and my colleagues in the other videos to send me bios that would allow you to better understand how they have come to see and negotiate the world as they do. Rather than send me their professional accomplishments, which you can find extensively in Internet searches, I asked them to send me more personal intimate information. I am going to tell you a little bit about both of them and then I am going to step away so they can have a dialog with one another. At the conclusion of their conversation, I will rejoin them to de breathe and reflect on their conversation and to identify take-home points as a result of their dialog. First, I'd like to tell you about Dr. Patricia Arredondo. Patricia grew up in a city of immigrants, Loraine, Ohio, learning about her Mexican heritage, family and that of other families, primarily from Eastern Europe. As one of seven children, she saw herself as a mini anthropologist, a curious learner in a multi-cultural community. Her fascination also included religious and ethnic differences, segregated neighborhoods and the lack of people of color and visible roles of authority. She continued cultural learning in Boston where she completed graduate studies and launched her professional career. In Boston, she was introduced to other immigrant and refugee groups, prompting her to establish a bilingual, bicultural counselor training program in Boston University. Patricia asserts that she has always sought to address neglected issues or groups, wanting to promote social justice issues, learning and listening influences for her approach to leadership. She took these practices to different life and professional experiences in Phoenix, Milwaukee, and now Chicago. Along the way, she has maintained close relationships with her step children, grand children, siblings and their families and engage in many mentorship relationships. Though willing to share publicly in professional settings, Patricia considers herself a private persona. Now let me tell you a little bit about Dr. Rebecca Toporek. Rebecca identifies as a white Polish, French Canadian cisgender women who immigrated to the United States from Canada at a young age and grew up in a mostly white, mostly middle class, mid-Western university. She has been in a committed heterosexual relationship with the same partner since she was 20 years old, although her perception of her own social class and sexual orientation has been complex and evolving. Rebecca recalls initiating race related discussions with peers beginning around the age of six and found it difficult to explain why language and attitudes were hurtful. When Rebecca began working as a new masters level counselor in the San Francisco Bay Area, she realized that she was inadequately trained to address the cultural and social class issues faced by her clients and so she embarked on a journey sometimes tumultuous to develop her own multi-cultural competence and awareness of racial and social class privilege and oppression. She credits many mentors along the way who challenged her to grow as a racially conscious counselor. In 1996, a desire to train budding counselors and to advocate for cultural competence and social justice at a larger level directed her to a doctoral program in counseling psychology with faculty who unbeknown to them have been pivotal in her own development. She has committed to bringing social justice and advocacy around racism, classism, and other oppressions into her current role as a counselor, educator, and in professional organizations. As a parent of two young adolescence, who identify as white, she is finding her way trying to foster their sense of urgency in social justice. She strives to provide mentorship, receive mentoring and remain humble and open as a continually evolving white person.

PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Well Rebecca, it's been a few months since we completed our chapters for Miguel's book on cultural humility and that was quite an interesting experience, wasn't it to get together and speak to one another in a different voice and sometimes we do -- where are you on that? How have you come away from that experience that we had? 

00:10:20
REBECCA TOPOREK Hmm-hmm. It was a very interesting experience for me to write about because it gave me the opportunity to reflect in a different way. I often do reflect because as I teach, I sort of try to role model self reflection and becoming aware but doing it for a chapter is a little bit of a different experience and I think one of the things for me with that as well because you were so pivotal early on in my development in multi-cultural competency, made it a much richer experience and also more challenging in some ways because I really want to honor you know the role that you played early on as well as continuing. Maybe I can ask the same for you because what we sort of try to do in the chapter I think is, have a bit of a dialog and maybe set the foundation for a dialog. 

00:11:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know when I reflect on this and certainly for the two of us you know you put it in a historical or a longitudinal context of knowing each other now for about 20 years, and one of the questions that came into the discussion in the book chapter was the journey and your journey and how that brought us together and has continued and I am just wondering if you have thoughts more about the beginning of our journey and because there was a shared journey. 

00:12:00
Role models are essential to developing cultural humility 

00:12:00
REBECCA TOPOREK Yes, yes definitely. Yeah, that's a really good question because as I think about it, and I think about my childhood and think about the -- my real awareness of structural oppression and then white privilege and my role in all of that. Really didn't evolve greatly until my early 20s, which is about the time I think that I saw you, and number of people present at a conference about multi-cultural competence and I was really feeling a need to develop that aspect of myself professionally and with some uncertainty about what would that mean for me as a white person and what that be, how would I go about doing that and so thinking about the foundation sort of laid by my parents and my early experience, but then finding professionally some people who sort of said, well here is a map, here's a way that you can do this, was very very helpful and as I reflect on that early contact, I realized that growing up as a shy person, a person who did a lot more observation than speaking, that it was really helpful for me to see role modeling you and your interaction with other people but also people such as Ellen Ivy, Mike Andrea and Thomas Parham and Daryl Sue, the way that those of you in that first meeting sort of engaged with each other and then invited the entire audience to really get active and engaged was really meaningful for me and I think in observing that sort of beginning to gain some of the language to be able to actually dialog about it and one of the things that I wonder and for me at that time, felt like a little bit of a risk to say, okay, I am going to do this, let me talk with some of these people and see whether you know I can continue to get some guidance is that I imagine you must often have people wanting to engage with you, people who are very early in their development around cultural competence and -- 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:35
Patricia asks Rebecca to reflect on her 

00:14:35
shift in roles from mentee to mentor. 

00:14:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO And I am sure now you are in that position as well, how do you find that as you're now mid-career, I am sure people are approaching you and asking you if they can be part of your work in social justice. 

00:14:50
REBECCA TOPOREK Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is a really interesting shift to be in, in that position and I think similar to the points that you brought up, the curiosity in the investment that you can see with someone is really helpful and I reflect on how some of the differences play a role in terms of at a conference and people are there and they have taken the initiative to be there and you can see they are excited and potentially don't have a lot of support where they are and so they are looking for and excited about the potential of having some additional support outside their graduate program or whatever. And also contrasting that to students who are in my own program and required to take my multi-cultural class, which I tell them on the first day, is going to be very challenging and if they are comfortable, then I am not doing my job right and how those conversations are different from somebody who actively seeks out and many of the students, particularly white students, may really want to engage with this, but become uncomfortable at times and then balancing the needs of the whole group with some individuals. 

00:16:10
Context is critical in understanding content 

00:16:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, you know you are right because the context where these conversations might take place, bring in different types of dynamics and at a conference, a student can approach me, can approach you and put something out in a question that maybe they can't do in a multi-cultural counseling class back at their university and that's what I think is terribly important is to for us to -- for me to always remember that they are different, not only are there different starting points for all of us, but there are different settings, in which I may feel freer to have the conversation, so the climate or the culture of the setting really informs how much communication a student can have with you or with me and the classroom where there is a power dynamic is going to be a little different where there is a grade involved in at a conference and where you -- someone might don't have to self censure quite the same way. I don't know if you have found that to be case. 

00:17:15
REBECCA TOPOREK Yes. I think so and I also think there's maybe more choice at a conference about follow-up, whereas with students, you know you are altogether for quite a while and there's the evaluative component that comes in and but one of the things that I appreciate about the places I am now and have been for the last 10 years is that, we have a very diverse student body, socioeconomically, ethnically, racially, sexual orientation disability and as a person who has privilege in many of those identities, one of the things that I am constantly trying to do is remain curious myself and to not fall too much in the expert role, particularly around multi-cultural competence and gauging people's developmental level as well as my own understanding of where they are and trying to recognize that I certainly always have places to grow and -- 

00:18:15
We are always learners 

00:18:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO That's where the cultural humility comes in, because really we're always learners. And I come to conferences and I meet people and I sit in on sessions and inevitably I will learn something from that presenter or I will have a conversation and recently I had a conversation with a young woman from Brazil who happens to be a Korean immigrant to Brazil. Now it had occurred me. And yet the presentation I made on multi-cultural counseling competencies resonated for her. We talked about the dimensions of personal identity and she saw herself in that. And I think that's what often happens. And maybe when we first met was, you had already been considering some of these social injustices and you know how do you work as a white women in a context with undervalued individuals, you know under-represented people. So I think there is already something personal we all bring to these exchanges and learning and I think the personal is probably not sufficiently talked about. I mean we talk about professional development, but it is also personal development. And I think that's where, you know for me, the cultural humility is a great way of describing you know always being my fault of that notion. 

00:19:55
REBECCA TOPOREK Right, right and constant development awareness and as time changes and I know even the different roles that we take on in life sort of shift our perspective and our ability to maybe be open and listen I know one of the things that has happened as I have become a mom and dealt with people in the community is the conversations that I've had where I am very aware of my kids, you know really understanding privilege and oppression in certain ways and getting into conversations with people that maybe aren't necessarily that interested in learning and developing culturally and I imagine and you've had many opportunities to engage in those kinds of conversations. And I wonder if you have some thoughts about engaging in dialog with people who maybe aren't seeking to be mentored or learned but it's clear that there needs to be some discussion. 

00:20:55
Hearing others experiences are essential 

00:20:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know a lot of it has to do with the context and the setting that is you know, are you in a social setting where there is some flexibility to talk about sociocultural issues. For example, recently I was in a social environment with people who are family, not family, where someone said that the passage of the or the elimination of The Defense of Marriage Act was the worse thing that could have happened to this country and I have to of course disagree with it, but in a way that I asked why they thought that. So I am not going to disagree right away, I am going to try and learn more what their thinking is about, their world view and how they cultured, and then introduce my point of view on this. Now I bothered to do it because I know I will be seeing these individuals over time. If it was someone who -- it was a one-time deal, I might just say, well you know I don't agree, but I probably would not have engaged as much. So I think the relationship matters to me as far as -- if this is going to be ongoing, I would feel dishonest if I didn't speak up, right, or if I can say something to that person. So I think the -- more than anything what I've learned over the years is to continue to be a good listener and be that counselor that inquires. Can you tell me more about that? I truly do that. And you know as an administrator in higher education, you can't really -- it's not that you're a poker face but you also can't offer you know very strong opinions you know you are trying to be a role model, but at the same time you know I want to understand why someone has an opinion that suggest that we shouldn't be perhaps talking about religion when we are teaching psychology, where is that coming from. And I would say that it's not about being the authority, but more about trying to understand and create understanding. I am always reminded by a statement that Cesar Chavez made. And it's in one of his books and he said, he would go out in the fields everyday and he would listen and learn from the farm workers and that kind of really resonates for me to listen and to learn and dialog, yeah. 

00:23:50
Listen and learn 

00:23:50
REBECCA TOPOREK I think that's a really interesting point and when I think to myself and reflect on my own development as a person coming to understand privilege and grapple with my own discomfort around privilege, I see various stages in my life of being able to have conversations with people that I don't agree with and I know initially and early on some of it was really about wanting to jump in and say, well do you know that's oppressive or whatever and I think as I have maybe gotten older, maybe had more conversations, maybe had time to practice, but also I think making mistakes and making assumptions about what I've heard or not heard that I think and I hope that I've gotten better about asking those questions first and not jumping to conclusions before I really understand what the person has actually said but also what their intention was in saying that and trying to be open to hearing and trying to understand their experience before trying to redirect -- 

00:25:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know this is where -- just thinking of what you said, you know we talk about multi-cultural competency sometimes like it's an event and rather than to develop a new process and I think there is a multi-cultural maturity process that goes on. We are not always as aware and that's where I say awareness never ends. And I think our awareness of social injustices will never end because you could walk by someone who's sitting on the street, who's homeless and have a judgment about that person, especially if you -- if I see him there every day. On the other hand, I don't know the cycle of poverty that person's gone through or some other conditions in his life and mostly they are men I see in Chicago and you know what has led them to that place and -- so I think it's so easy to cast judgment, you are right. On the other hand, I also have to know the limits of my -- where I can intervene, you know, I have not stopped to have the conversation of how this individual got there. But you know it -- just this information or I guess that new -- seeing something like that, you take that back to your classroom, you know or you use that as an example of pushing our students to be curious and to not make the judgments as you said. 

00:26:40
REBECCA TOPOREK  Right, right. And it sort of leads to another thing that I think maybe is helpful for people to develop and having conversations, being curious developing themselves but then also being able to dialog with others is understanding how to manage situations where it's not clear that everyone is wanting a similar outcome or not everyone is wanting to gain understanding or growth and the intentions maybe conflicting or also the conversation may become hostile and particularly maybe for people who've had traumatic experiences or that triggers sort of come up in dialog around racism or oppression and particularly now thinking recently about the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin and this whole past year and a half or so is I think for a lot of people bringing up very sensitive and many many issues beyond these incidents. And I wonder as you see dialogs and participate with people in many different environments that you are in, any thoughts about recognizing when maybe the conversation actually is not really going to be good to continue. 

00:28:10
Create the space for dialogue 

00:28:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well I mean I can sense that. I think it's really about the purpose of the dialog and is it the time you pull in and say well this isn't going where we needed to go because I think oftentimes, we have expectations that when we had the conversation at the school about the Zimmerman verdict for example, I had no idea what would come out of the conversation. I think I went into that with the expectation that we would create the space for dialog, number one, number two it was the responsibility of the school to do that because we are training counselors and psychologists, three was to have the right facilitator, someone who is experienced and with some ground rules. And you know I think that people who selected to come to that were there because they needed a space to also be you know share in a tough situation that had just gone down, whether they spoke or didn't speak and I think more than anything, what often happens is, we don't create a space for emotions to be aired and what I would say to you, that space gave people you know an opportunity to express fear, you know concern, and fortunately we stayed away from talking about the legal aspect of it but more to keep it real because we were thinking about clients, as well as their selves, you know and I think that's where it can't always be about the other, it's how did this affect me, you know where does this leave me, as well though and working with my clients. So I think that's -- we sometimes go into situations with expectations, but I think I always believe in those particular settings that we have to be okay that people walk away with different understandings or different conclusions or in a different place. We can't make it always all okay for everybody. That's simply said. 

00:30:35
REBECCA TOPOREK True. And people don't always leave a dialog feeling really good about what's happened, there's not necessarily closure and there's not necessarily big hugs at the end. 

00:30:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Not always, not always but I think it's again from the point of view of creating a space for new knowledge and for the airing of concerns and emotions. I think that's consistent for me with promoting multi-cultural competency development and social justice advocacy. 

00:31:05
REBECCA TOPOREK I think that would be a great next step. 

00:31:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Great, thank you. 

00:31:15
MIGUEL GALLARDO I appreciate both of you engaging in the dialog and the discussion, it was a very fruitful and advantageous dialog to be on the listening end, so I appreciate. I know these conversations can sometimes be a little bit challenging at times. I wanted to follow up though with a few questions. I know we don't have a ton of time to de breathe but we talked -- you both talked about context and context does matter, so let me talk about the context of the classrooms. Rebecca I am curious, you know oftentimes I have white students in my class, who when we started talking about cultural issues, they just tend to sort of run the other way from or say that they don't have any part of or they don't have culture. How do we help those students really connect with these issues on a emotional level, intellectually they get it, but not always emotionally, what shall we do, how can we think about that? 

00:32:05
REBECCA TOPOREK I think one of the things is that people come into these kind of conversations with a perception about what culture is and particular definitions and with white students, white people in particular, there is an aspect of guilt. That sort of prevents people from being able to be open and curious and vulnerable. And so there are number of different things that I found useful in working with students, but also in any type of training situation is helping people regardless of their background to start to take a look at their own background and so interviews with important family members has been really useful, having them go back and do a cultural interview with a guardian or a parent or a significant person in their life to hear how that person grew up, what was important, what were some of the privileges, not using that language in the interview but asking and then having the student or the interviewer reflect back on that and think about the sociopolitical context that the interviewee grew up in and what were some of the things that influence them in terms of chronological events but also the sociopolitical context, and so having people think about culture in a broader sense and also having them think about things that were important as they grew up sayings that they learned from as they grew up. What were some of the lessons that they learned, to start to kind of define culture, what it might mean. There's something I am going to use this next time around is an exercise of writing a poem about my race is and it was really interesting the way my daughter approached that, really in terms of looking at her family members and describing her family members and then ending with but people call me white, so I think I am going to use that with my students and sort of see what comes out and really honor the complexity that people come to in terms of their identities and embracing the parts that really are their sociopolitical identities. 

00:34:25
MIGUEL GALLARDO So broadly in our definition of culture, but not necessarily minimizing any one particular aspect of those multiple social identities, so there's always a concern. If we broaden culture too much, then we don't focus enough on race or ethnicity or some of those issues. So broadening that but also still prioritizing and sustaining commitment to the various social identities people bringing to the table. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Patricia it's interesting, I think for students of color or students from historically devalued communities, oppressed communities, disenfranchised communities, there is this assumption that we've come out of the womb culturally responsive in some way that there is ascribed credibility that we have because we are people of color if you will, how would you -- what do you think about that, how do you respond to that. I have some challenges with that personally actually and I think sometimes that creates challenges and discussions and an openness sometimes, what do you think about that? 

00:35:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Well, certainly not everyone has the leg up on being culturally responsive, unless they have actually gone through some learning. The way I look at it and let's say in the classroom is that, everyone as an individual is at a different baseline in their multi-cultural development. Their awareness of these various dimensions of identity are often not very pronounced or present because they haven't thought about them or they haven't caused sorts of grief. Now, as an under-represented person, an ethnic minority person in United States, you are probably more aware of how your visible traits have affected you. That doesn't mean you are an expert on race or you are an expert on your ethnic group. I remember many years ago I was teaching, giving a seminar on multi-cultural issues in counseling. And one of the professors in the group said, is it that you can talk about this because you are Mexican-American. I said hardly. I said because I am Mexican-American doesn't make me an expert on anything and that's the same thing I guess that applies in the classroom is, we have to learn about where our roots brought us and about all the social conditions in the United States to really understand ourselves. So no one is an expert on that regardless and that's why they earned a classroom right. They are on a learning journey and so I don't attribute that kind of expertise just because nor do I expect those students to be the teachers of the other students. I think that's a very unfortunate dynamic to set up in the classroom. 

00:37:25
MIGUEL GALLARDO Absolutely. 

00:37:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO So I think we have to be ready though as professors you know as I say to have a talkative anticipation of how we get students to move towards their development, their multi-cultural accounts and development. And how they can do that I think for understanding different points of oppression they've had based on might be it's been more oppression based on gender or sexual orientation versus their ethnicity. It depends on how you look, how you speak and so forth. So it's complex, right? 

00:38:00
MIGUEL GALLARDO Absolutely, absolutely. So my last question to both of you as we wrap up this segment. Takeaways take-home, so if you are going to -- you want a -- people wanted to mention a few things or one or two things that you'd want people to take away from listening to this conversation and learning how to better state present and conversations, create those spaces for conversations, sustain the challenges that come with those conversations. What would you say to folks? What would be important for them to remember and to think about as they try to have dialog? 

00:38:35
REBECCA TOPOREK I think for me, there are few. One is, I really appreciate the discussion about curiosity, and maintaining a curiosity and desire to understand when engaged in dialog and I think the other piece is recognizing that it's a process. Over time, that it's something that we learn to get better at and some of the early conversations for people who maybe have not had conversations like this. That it maybe rocky some times, initially and I know for myself particularly in an effort to engage in dialog and conversation, sometimes I said things that it didn't come out the way I intended, but I have to recognize and reflect on, is there some part of my socialization that actually created this way of communicating that actually, I need to take a look at. And so I think recognizing it's a developmental process, to be patient with the process and to persist with the process is really important. 

00:39:45
PATRICIA ARREDONDO I think another takeaway or two that, good ones that Rebecca mentioned is the practice of role taking and how important it is to bring that into the classroom. Because sometimes, we talk about developing empathy but you don't just develop empathy and I believe the role taking can allow somebody to say, I don't know what it's like for that person, so if I say to you, Miguel you ask the women, you know what is like to be a women, you know, if I were, I don't know what it's like to be a women. So I mean it's all kind of those role-reversals that I think does help to create a little bit of a freezing. I think the other and you just alluded to it now Rebecca's recovery skills, and how we have to remind our students as well as ourselves that you know a cultural flaw is not fatal, unless we choose to not own it or -- but we all make them and it's how we recovered from those and whether it's the apology or I am sorry kind of thing. You know but owning it, so but recovery I think we can recover from cultural errors and still continue to learn. I mean that's how learning happens. 

00:41:05
MIGUEL GALLARDO That's right. We just have to go back and stay present, which is key, which is key. Well my deepest and sincerest appreciation to both of you. I really benefited from the conversation in hearing both of you talk today and so I know others will as well. So thank you both very much for the time and for your participation. 

00:41:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah, enjoyed it. Thank you.

MIGUEL GALLARDO Thank you for taking the time to watch video number 2 in the video series Developing Cultural Humility, Understanding How to Engage in Difficult Dialogues. So I mentioned in video 1 the purpose of these videos is to demonstrate and to hopefully facilitate more authentic and genuine multi-cultural dialogs and relationships with others. In this video, we are going to hear from doctors Usha Tummala-Narra and Pamela Hays. Like in the first video, doctors Tummala-Narra and Hays contributed to my edited book on Developing Cultural Humility and in this video, they will continue their dialog in ways that book chapter simply do not permit. As I did in the previous video, I ask both of them to send me bios that would allow you to better understand their world views and how they have come to situate their lives within a multi-cultural lens, both personally and professionally.

MIGUEL GALLARDO As I did previously, I’m going to introduce both of them and then I’m going to step away so that they can have a dialog with one another. At the conclusion, I will rejoin them to debrief and reflect on their conversation and to identify take-home points as a result of their dialog. I’d like to first introduce you to Dr. Usha Tummala-Narra. Usha is an Indian-American woman who migrated to the United States with her parents and brother when she was seven years old in 1977. In the US, she grew up in New York City, New Jersey and Michigan. The migration process left a critical imprint on her personal life and her professional interest. Experiences of language barriers, cultural and religious differences and racism marked some of the stressful aspects of adjusting to life in a new cultural context. Much of this stress was largely un-addressed in her family and in the broader Indian community. The silence on issues such as mental health and interpersonal violence within the Indian-American community had considerable impact on her decision to pursue a career in psychology. In graduate school and in her post doctoral training, she became increasingly interested in improving access to culturally competent mental health practice to immigrant origin individuals and communities. Soon after the completion of her post-doctoral training, she founded and directed the Asian Mental Health Clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance. Usha relocated to Washington DC and then to Michigan, where she had a clinical practice and taught in various academic institutions. In 2009, she decided to move back to the Boston area with her husband and two sons, and accepted a tenure track faculty position in counseling psychology program at Boston College. Her work continues to focus on issues of immigration, trauma, race and cultural competence in psychotherapy practice. Now I’d like to introduce to Dr. Pamela Hays. Pam is a woman of Scotch-Irish-English heritage who grew up in the 1960s and 70s in predominantly white rural communities and that she describes in her chapter without much awareness of her own cultural heritage or identity. Initial turning point occurred when she left her family home in Alaska at age 17 and began deliberately moving by herself to differently places to learn about different cultures and languages, periodically returning to Alaska to earn money, working as a waitress during the oil boom years. She describes her young adult years in New Mexico, France, the UK, Hawaii, Oregon and New York as difficult but key in shaping her views of this topic. A second turning point occurred while she was living in France where she met, then subsequently married a Tunisian man of Arab and Muslim heritage. Together, they eventually move to Seattle, where he studied political science and she taught in the graduate psychology program at Antioch University, Seattle. At Antioch as Pam expanded her understanding of her own bio-season privilege in relation to people of color and other minority communities in the US. Her teaching experiences led her to develop the addressing framework as a way to understand and address the complexities of cultural influences that affect both dominant and minority cultural members. Following a divorce and subsequent return to her hometown, she married a “Big white Alaskan guy” her parents introduced her to and she now lives in a rural Alaskan community near her family, has a private practice and work part time with the Alaskan native, Kenaitze Tribe's Counseling Center.

PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA  Pam, I really enjoyed having the opportunity to work with you on this chapter and reading your chapter and really grateful for the opportunity to read your experience. And I would love to hear more about what the whole process was like for you. What it for your like to write the chapter and to take on something that was more personal? 

00:47:20
PAMELA HAYS Well, I have to admit, I was a little nervous initially when Miguel asked me to write it, because I didn’t want -- as a white person in the field, I didn’t want to come off as focus on me kind of my experience. I know when I’ve taught -- I teach multi-cultural counseling classes. Sometimes, there is this response among white students where a student of color in the class has shared an experience that they have that’s really painful, an experience of oppression or something like that and the white student will come in and try to be very helpful and connect with the student color will say something like, “Oh! I know just what you’re feeling. I’ve had the same kind of experience.” Or “I know, I’ve had that experience too.” And it doesn’t go well, -- the dialog doesn’t go well from there because the white student does understand that they really haven’t had the same experience. They might have had an experience to them that feels like that, but they really don’t know what’s it’s like to be the student of color. So, I was very cautious about this idea. If there is a white person writing about my experience of being in the multi-cultural field. 

00:48:45
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA  And do you know what helped you move past that in writing and how did you get through the writing itself? 

00:48:55
PAMELA HAYS Well, I think I approached it the way I approached the topic of culture in general, which is I really love cross-culture work. I mean, to me it’s been a source of learning and joy and support and I’ve had some painful experiences related to a two but it’s mostly been really enriching to my life. And then, when -- you and I had not met before this, but then when I agreed to do it and we got together and talked before I think I had already agreed to write it at that point, but when we got together and talked, then my anxiety went away completely because I can tell you aren’t going to chew me up in your response, because we’re pretty much on the same page, in terms of how we thought about this field and things we talked about, some of our views. And so then I looked at it as “Oh! Okay this is going to be interesting, I can just write about my experience” And it’ll be interesting to see what your response is too from your experience. 

00:50:00
Developing Cultural Humility means being vulnerable and taking risks. 

00:50:00
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA  It’s interesting because I also felt pretty vulnerable writing the response to your chapter because I think that it’s in some ways more comfortable to talk theoretically and then when it came down to actually really reflecting on what my personal experiences were. And even though I’ve been aware of them, but to really try to think about how they’ve really impacted the way I think about my work as a psychologist and why I’m in this field and sort of a larger purpose. And then having to write about it and reveal some of those experiences, I think were difficult, but I think reading your chapter and then responding to it that really helped me to feel a little less vulnerable and take more risks. So, I think that your style of writing allowed for that kind of -- that ability in myself actually to say more than I maybe usually do, about myself of my own experience, I appreciated that. 

00:51:20
PAMELA HAYS I think what you’ve wrote was very powerful and yes, I really appreciated likewise your feedback too. 

00:51:30
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA  I wondered, one of the questions I was left with after reading your chapter and thinking about this more, I wondered if you could maybe say a little bit more about some of the experiences that you might have had as being the other -- like the what you had just talked about, your concern that maybe you really don’t know, what it’s like to be a racial minority person, ethnic minority person. You’ve had many experiences of travelling, working with clients and students from various backgrounds and I’m wondering if you can maybe think of a time or a couple of times that you have felt like you’ve been received as the other or someone who doesn’t belong necessarily or the outsider and how that played out? 

00:52:25
It is critical to be proactive in experiencing "otherness" 

00:52:25
PAMELA HAYS I’ve had a number of experiences like that, because I’ve put myself in those positions on purpose, because I knew it would be a learning experience for me. And some of them have been painful, most of them I would say, I have felt very welcomed actually, people have been very kind. One that was painful, which just popped to my head when you asked was, I once went to a -- it was some kind of a division meeting with the American Counseling Association at their big conference and it was a large room probably about a 150 people and when I walked in, I can quickly see that there were only two white people, visibly white people anyway in the room, me and one other young woman, who I didn’t know. She was standing some place far from me and then when we all sat down at the tables, she walked right over to me a sat right next to me. I felt very uncomfortable when she did that and I was kind to her, I wanted to be nice to her, but at the same time, I thought it -- said something that she did that and I didn’t want people to think I was saying the same thing. And if you ask me what it was, I think communicated to people, I don’t know, I’m just inferring this. I would think people might think, Oh! They’re really uncomfortable being here, they’re kind of scare, they’re sticking together, that kind of thing. When people were very nice actually and I felt more conspicuous without doing that than I would’ve if I’ve just been sitting there by myself. 

00:54:15
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA And what happened after that? 

00:54:20
PAMELA HAYS Well, it got a more uncomfortable because the woman sitting next to me was an academic psychologist and we started talking and she said something to me like you need to teach your sisters something, something, assuming that I was friends with other white woman. And I’m not sure where that came from but I felt very uncomfortable like. She was making assumptions about -- she didn’t know that the work that I had done and the commitment I had to multi-cultural perspectives. So, yeah, I had a little bit of that experience of feeling like someone’s making assumptions about what I think and what I believe and where I’m coming from. But at the same time, I am very clear that that is not the same experience that I know a person of color has when they walk into a room of all white people. I mean I’m walking in a fellow psychologist in a room like that with a certain amount of privilege and respect given to me automatically and that kind of thing. So, it isn’t the same thing, yeah. Imagine -- you could talk about that I’m sure, about that experience of being the other. 

00:55:50
Making assumptions are dangerous when 

00:55:50
attempting to understand and connect 

00:55:50
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Yeah, yeah. When you were describing this incident with psychologists, I was thinking an incident that came really early in my experience, when I was training in my graduate program and there was a fellow graduate student and we had a group supervision, weekly group supervision together. And every week, we would listen to psychotherapy tapes with our clients and we would -- our supervisor would give feedback along with our peers about how the session went. And then one of the -- something happened in a session where I had to come to a point of confronting a client that I was working with about a self destructive kind of behavior that she was involved with. And so, I think I had -- I can’t quite remember what I had said, but we had a pretty intense conversation and my fellow students and the supervisor, everybody listened to the tape. And at the end of the supervision session, one of the students had come up to me and she said, you know that took a lot for and Indian woman to be assertive and it came as a shock to me, because I don’t think I ever conceptualized Indian women in that way until she had said that to me. So, it was actually really jarring and so I remember feeling like I was confused first and then I decided to ask her to talk to me about it and she had a really hard time then kind of responding to me. 

00:57:50
We cannot substitute cultural assumptions for being culturally responsive. 

00:57:50
PAMELA HAYS Is that what you said? What were the words you used? 

00:57:55
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Well, I said to her, do you think that -- we could talk more about that, because I’m confused. So, I did just kind of say what I was feeling the moment. And I had known this pure of mind of a few months, so it didn’t feel like a completely new interaction, but I was a little worried that if I didn’t talk to her that she would -- that we still had an entire semester left and what would this be like plus I was just disturbed by the comment I think. 

00:58:25
PAMELA HAYS Did you feel irritated like angry? 

00:58:30
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I did. I did feel. 

00:58:30
PAMELA HAYS I think so. 

00:58:30
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I did feel upset with it, but I think that it was so powerful for me, because I felt like this is something that could be assumed about a client very easily and I was surprised at the way that she felt really free to say something like that. I felt like that did come from place of privilege actually because I couldn’t imagine myself feeling like I could say whatever was on my mind that I do tend to probably think more about how this might impact or how this might -- whatever I say might impact somebody else or how it might be perceived, probably in part because of being a minority person that there is some screening that goes on because of that. And I imagined that’s something that I’ve been raised to do in some ways in my own family but also just through interactions professionally also. 

00:59:30
PAMELA HAYS Kind of self monitoring? 

00:59:35
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Yes, yes, kind of self monitoring. And I imagine that happens for many people when it comes to talking about race or culture, sexual orientation, do you find yourself doing that? 

00:59:50
PAMELA HAYS Oh! Yeah, but probably because I started -- I mean -- I think it’s probably for two reasons. One is I come from kind of rural roots and I think I learnt somewhere along the way, if you’re not sure what to say or do, don’t say anything just be quiet and yes, I think that’s one reason, I forgot the other reason. It’ll come to me in a minute. 

01:00:20
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I’ve had students of my -- now that I teach multi-cultural issues course and I’ve had students who will often say that they’ve been taught not to judge. They’ve been taught not to judge others and not see difference that this is actually pretty much a core value for them. And so… 

01:00:40
PAMELA HAYS  Are they white students or certain color? 

01:00:45
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA These are white students. 

01:00:45
PAMELA HAYS White students. Oh! 

01:00:45
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA … who will say that this is not something we’re taught to do. So, actually talking about diversity feels like it runs counter to what they value and what their parents taught them to do. 

01:01:00
PAMELA HAYS Yes, that idea if you notice a difference, it’s impolite to notice a difference like you wouldn’t comment on somebody have a disability. So, you even pointed out same thing like a social class or other kinds of differences. You just don’t mention them and then you act as if they’re not there, but the problem with that is then you don’t realize it -- those differences maybe having an influence on the way you interact or communicate. 

01:01:30
Pretending that differences do not exit does not make them go away. 

01:01:30
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA And there isn’t a way in which when you go outside of your home that it’s easy to come to figure out what to do with that. That question that comes up in people’s minds and I think as a minority person, I’ve always been taught to think about difference, because we always felt different in some level. So, it was always present. And so, it’s interesting when I teach students who come from such different backgrounds and I’m thinking about my fellow student in graduate school who had a very different experience too in that way of when you see difference maybe to feel privileged enough to speak about it in that way or not talk about it all. So, it feels kind of like a -- I don’t know, it’s complicated sometimes you are supposed to talk about it and sometimes you’re not. 

01:02:25
PAMELA HAYS Right, well I mean even from your perspective there are times you wouldn’t bring up the difference either. Right, I mean… 

01:02:35
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA That’s right. 

01:02:35
PAMELA HAYS I think it’s a really interesting question, this question of when you speak up and when to speak up and when not. I think I can see out of some cultural traditions and experiences why it’s so essential to speak up. For example, among African-Americans who given the experiences they’ve had historically and even currently, that there is a this real strong sense of if someone is doing or saying something offensive you need to speak out about it similarly for Jewish people. Working with native people right now in my work in Alaska, there is a very different approach to this, that kind of a situation where somebody says something offensive. I was recently in a meeting where there was a high level person in the meeting and we had just done kind of a let’s -- sort of a communication sort of interaction to build rapport in the group and it was mixed. Native people and non-native people and this man was not native, but he was pretty high-up in the hierarchy organizationally. And he said something like, you know I’m so glad I grew up in anchorage and not around any native people at all. So, I’m so grateful because for that reason I didn’t develop any prejudices or biases about native people at all. And there was just this silence in the room. Nobody said a word. And I don’t he even got the meaning of the silence actually because he hadn’t worked with the tribe that long so he didn’t know that silence can communicate something. But yes, so there’s different approaches of that and I know when I first got in the field. I really kind of struggled with that because my tendency is more like I said, to get quiet and think about it rather than to respond right away -- certainly I’m not inclined to responding in an aggressive way or even very assertive way until I think about it and then decide what I’m going to do. 

01:05:10
Deciding to when to share experiences or 

01:05:10
just listen, are important distinctions 

01:05:10
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I think it’s a really important question to have some time to reflect on for ourselves when do we actually choose to bring these issues up and when do we not. And I am thinking of times when I feel most comfortable bringing them up and one other things we just start our conversation about just hearing other people and be willing to open up and talk about their own experiences. I think that often helps or having a supervisor who brings up the issue before I need to bring it up so that I don’t feel like I am the one who has to initiate this discussion because it’s an issue that’s important to me alone. So, there’s something about being with someone else who can open up to their own experience that really helps me open up to my anything. So, I think that’s one thing that facilitates that dialog. I’m wondering if there are other things in your life that help you think about engaging and talking about diversity more. 

01:06:30
PAMELA HAYS I think that one of the most powerful is talking on a personal level. And I recently heard a Ted Talk by Brene Brown where she talks about -- she talks about. She’s a social worker who talks about vulnerability. When we share something about ourselves that makes us vulnerable, it tends to open up something in the other person kind of compassionate response just sort of naturally and it’s much easier than to share something that makes you vulnerable and then boom, you’ve connected because you’ve crossed over the bridge and something and connected on that human level that we all suffer underneath all this other stuff we human beings all suffer and we have that in common. Yes, so that’s a way. The other thing for me in communication has been learning languages, studying languages and that was one of my big draws when I started moving to different cultures to live. I loved learning languages. And there’s a ton of humor in learning languages and I realize that’s not the case for the people who are coming say from a minority, like in other country and it’s really -- could be very stressful, but in my privileged position, it was actually a lot of fun to learn language and then to go into practice and I’d find people would be so kind and reinforce saying and I would make all sorts of mistakes and they would laugh. And when I lived in North Africa all I would have to say was something like “Oh! It’s a lovely day today.” And people would break out laughing because they’d never heard an American say that anything before in Arabic and I never got fluent in Arabic at all. Humor tends to open up conversation and dialog. I read somewhere that sharing pain is a way to connect and sharing laughter is a way to connect also. 

01:08:25
The sharing of experiences can be powerful tools in understanding others. 

01:08:25
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I think it’s a great point, because there is I think a lot of times, every time, people bring up the issue of diversity or difference that immediately draws up negative thoughts and feelings that this is a burden that they have to work through or it’s going to be really hard work and I think that’s true to some extent or at least on one layer. And I think the other layer is that it can be really fun and there’s a lot of pressure in it. 

01:08:50
PAMELA HAYS Is it for you too? 

01:08:55
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA It is for me too. It is for me because I think sometimes there’s an assumption that because you’re an ethnic minority person that somehow you would know everything about what that means for every ethnic minority person there is and of course that’s simply not true. So, I’m always learning and I think the travel, the opportunity to travel you have it, I think it’s a great one, but just doing things in your just your day-to-day life that open you up and expose you to new knowledge, new perspectives that’s really I think critical for everybody and so that’s been really important to me as well. 

01:09:35
Cultural immersion does not need to be an international experience. 

01:09:40

01:09:45
MIGUEL GALLARDO Well, I appreciate both of you taking some time to come and talk about not only some of your professional processes, but also your personal journey as well. I know that takes a little bit of putting oneself out there and be a little bit vulnerable and susceptible so thank you both for that. I just have a few follow-up questions that we’ll have a dialog with for a few minutes. We don’t have a whole lot of time in this debriefing time. One of my first questions is how do we get people to move from understanding things on a intellectual level? So, for example, understanding racism, discrimination, oppression and justice, on this intellectual level, but not necessarily on the emotional level. So, for example in my classes oftentimes I have white students who have a hard time identifying and connecting with these particular conversations or oppression, discrimination, racism etcetera. How can we help people move from the more intellectual cognitive understanding to a more emotional effective empathic understanding about this issue? Do you have ideas about that? 

01:10:50
PAMELA HAYS Well I found, when I do my teaching that when I’m working with a group that’s predominantly dominant culture that what works best is to start with their own culture, because we all tend to be a little bit self-centered and we’re all interested in sort of where we came from and how that affects what we do in as therapists too, it’s even more important to understand biases, influences on yourself and how those might bias you. So, I start with exercises that get people looking at the cultural influences on themselves and when they could start to see the connection between that and the privilege connected to those influences then they can go to “Okay, how is this going to affect my interactions with somebody who doesn’t have this privilege?” 

01:11:35
MIGUEL GALLARDO  What about someone who says I don’t have culture. 

01:11:40
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I think that -- it takes sort of like another layer of reflection for this, because I think one of the things I’ve asked whether it’s students or colleagues who don’t want to engage with conversations like this. Just ask the question have you ever felt like you are understood or people made assumptions about you. And do you think those experiences actually made a difference in your life, did they change anything for you? Even for a little while, maybe not for long periods of time or maybe not long-term but maybe even briefly. If you’ve had that kind of experience, maybe you could relate to something that someone else might have gone through for maybe a larger reason perhaps. So, it seems like that sort of in some ways I think in many cases has helped me to move a little bit more to that emotional space rather than kind of keep it to diversity as this kind of idea or thought. So, that sometimes happens. 

01:12:50
PAMELA HAYS That sounds like what we are doing is very similar to their because we’re both having people start with their own experience. 

01:13:00
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA That’s right. 

01:13:00
PAMELA HAYS And there’s something about validating that, “Oh! That must have been painful for you too.” That then people can go ahead and connect with, listen to someone else’s experience. 

01:13:10
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Yes, I think it involves having empathy right for someone else’s experience even though in the moment, I can feel really jarring to hear that when a person just wants to at least consciously just disengage from talking about it or thinking about it. 

01:13:30
MIGUEL GALLARDO Yes, absolutely. On the flip side of that and this is where I think conversations can really become stifled and then there is this point of paralysis is you will. I think for a lot of students and professionals who come from historically and more currently devalued communities, there is this automatic ascribed credibility that is put on us simply because of maybe how we look, typically what our surname might be, whatever it may be. And I think sometimes that in genders unintentional challenges when to try to have conversations. What do you think about this, ascribed credibility that we give to folks and do you see that as a benefit, as a challenge, do you see one or both of you? 

01:14:20
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA I see it probably as both depending on the circumstance. There are times that I think when there is some ascription to knowing about one’s culture. There is some benefit in that, I think the person’s trying to assume that well, maybe this person is connected to something or to a larger group, an ethnic group or religious group and so forth. And that might be a positive ascription too. At the same time, it can also be a generalization where you assume that this person must know everything about that culture or must be truly connected to that culture in every dimension rather than really asking more questions. And seeing whether or not that person’s actually interested in what you’ve assumed about them so I think it’s very -- it's complicated. And I’ve been in -- this comes up sometimes when we’re evaluating students and the question comes up around some students who are from an Asian background for example. And the instructors might tell, “Well, that person is kind of quiet in classes” That a cultural thing and so this is the kind of ascription that comes to my mind that this must be because they’re of this particular background and I think that’s problematic. We don’t know actually so that’s one example to comes to my mind. 

01:15:55
PAMELA HAYS I think we’re always making hypothesis based on what little information we do have and what we visibly perceive or hear in the moment is what we have to go on. So, we have to do that, but as we the more of background information we know about different cultures the more the closer our hypotheses will be to the actual experience of the person we’re talking to, whether it’s a colleague or a student or a client. I think that credibility thing though about, being ascribed credibility based on however you look, it hits everybody actually. I mean, I think -- I know as a white person there are many white people have way more credibility with when I’m doing a workshop presentation than a person of color would. And which really kind of puzzles me because -- it puzzles me, I wouldn’t think that, but in any case, but I think there are many white people too, myself included actually if I’m going to workshop that’s on multi-culturalism and its taught by a white person, a much less likely to even go to something like that, thinking, I don’t know if I’m going to learn anything from then really. And then there is some people of color who well would be more likely to listen to another person of color. On the other hand, there is some people of color sometimes that give more weight to the words of a white man for example. So, it just hits everybody I think in different ways. Racism hurts everybody. 

01:17:45
MIGUEL GALLARDO Absolutely. 

01:17:45
PAMELA HAYS I mean, it hurts people of minority identities way more, but I think what people with privilege often don’t realize is particularly if you are a therapist, the ways in which it can limit your ability to work with somebody. 

01:18:05
MIGUEL GALLARDO Yes, absolutely. It’s a good point, it’s a good point. Along with ascribed credibility, there’s -- Pam we talked about this a little bit, all three of us in between transitions here and you mentioned compassion fatigue. And I think sometimes, compassion fatigue can come from this ascribed credibility and assuming that people know a lot and that they can speak to all the issues and that they can continue do that and do that and do that and I think it can take its toll on people in some ways. Was that the area where you were thinking about? 

01:18:45
PAMELA HAYS I experienced it in a little bit of a way as a white person just when I -- right now I’m living in a rural community that’s predominantly white. For example, someone might say “This is my home-town, I’m living in again after being gone 20 years.” Someone might say something really negative about Arab-Muslim people. As I mentioned in the book, I was married to an Arab-Muslim man for 16 years and connected as family. And so, immediately what pops up for me is defensiveness, but then there is also a part of me that sort of choose my battles like, okay is this person so far removed from what I could tell them that it would take me a six hour conversation to get from where I am and my understanding experience with that which has been positive with Arabian Muslim people and to where they are and I’m not going to do it. So, I just don’t say anything or say something that indicates disagreement and then drop it. That’s how my compassion fatigue comes out, but it’s -- I also see it as just like I said choosing my battles or some things I’m just not going to go with. But if somebody have a relationship with, then I have to say something and do something. But I’m also coming from a privileged place of I can choose that, in a way that I think people of color don’t have that choice. It’s just in your face whether you like it or not, the comments, the sights, those kinds of things. So, that was a question I was interested and your response too sort of had you experienced that and if you do when you do, how do you deal with it? 

01:20:50
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Yes, of course. It is I think part of the process. I think one of the things I do in some ways similar to what you do and that there are times when it feels like it’s too much, when it overwhelms that I feel like I’m not sort of maybe I become too bombarded from different fronts or I feel like I’m not really making movement in the way that I want to either if it’s work or something personally. Then I do need my breaks from it and yet at the same time, like you said, it’s still there. I think something that lifts me out of it is maybe a larger purpose, larger feeling that it’s not -- the work I’m doing is not just for me, it’s for a community or multiple communities, it’s for a larger purpose beyond just me. And I think that’s what eventually kind of propels me out of that space. But I think that it does -- I think it affects all of us who do this work and how could it not? It’s so emotionally charged. It’s very personal and it’s professional as both. So, it’s hard to separate that out. 

01:22:10
MIGUEL GALLARDO Yes, that’s good and that’s helpful. And finally, takeaways from this video and your conversation. If there were one or two take home messages or takeaways that you’d like people to reflect on and continue to process beyond your conversation. What would be those for the two of you? 

01:22:30
PAMELA HAYS I think mine would be just in this what I think of is multi-cultural revolution that were in the midst of here. There’s a place for everybody’s voice. We really do need everybody’s voice, it’s important though. White people speak up and that people of color should speak up, people who are gay, people with disabilities, people of diverse religious perspectives, because there is a richness and so much to gain from diversity and so we do -- we need all those voices. 

01:23:05
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Just adding to that I think it’s really important to remember that this is for the good of everybody and not just for people of color, not just for minorities or people who are on the margins, but it’s really for everyone that we all hold the larger purpose in mind that it benefits all of society that when we think about the future and when we think about the present, that we live in a multi-cultural society, we don’t rally live in these little boxes anymore that we live across these boxes in and out all through. So, it’s time we realize it’s for all of us. 

01:23:50
MIGUEL GALLARDO A sense of dependence and indebtedness to one and another and always remembering to see ourselves in other people regardless of who they are and where they come from, I think it’s important. I am grateful to both of you. Thank you so much for the time and for participating in the conversation. I know folks you’re going to benefit from watching and listening and also hopefully reading the chapters as well. So, thank you both. 

01:24:15
PAMELA HAYS Thank you. 

01:24:15
PRATYUSHA TUMMALA-NARRA Thank you.
