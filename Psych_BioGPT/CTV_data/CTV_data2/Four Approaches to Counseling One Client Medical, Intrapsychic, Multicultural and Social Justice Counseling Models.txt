Four Approaches to Counseling One Client: Medical, Intrapsychic, Multicultural and Social Justice Counseling Models by Dr. Manivong J. Ratts, Seattle University Counseling and School Psychology 

00:00:20
DR. MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi, my name is Dr. Manivong J. Ratts. And uh, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Counseling and School Psychology here at Seattle University. I'm also um, President of Counsel for Social Justice for the 2011/2012 academic year. Uh, we're a division of the American Counseling Association. And our focus is really on how to promote social justice in the counseling profession, and addressing issues of equity. That's what I'm going to be talking about today in terms of today's lecture. Which is going to be focusing on how can counselors incorporate social justice into their work with clients. Just to give you an overview of today's uh, lecture. We're going to look at, start by looking at the four main, predominantly counseling paradigms in the field that have really shaped how we practice counseling and also uh, how we view counseling in, in society. The first model we're going to look at is the medical model. Which really takes a biological perspective of looking at human behavior and understanding the human experience. The second model that we're going to look at in depth is the intrapsychic model. Which looks at the biologic and psychologic perspective of understanding human behavior. The third model is the multicultural model. This is where we see the inner section of biology and psychology, and sociology in the field. The fourth model is the social justice counseling model. Which I refer to as the bio-psycho-social and advocacy model in the counseling profession. And I'll go over each of these models a little more in depth. But we're going to start today's lecture with focusing on these four predominant models in the field. Then what I'm going to do is, I'm going to introduce and talk about more in depth the social justice counseling model and really give you a conceptional framework about what that looks like. I think that's really important because one of the things I'm hearing from people is, how do we operationalize social justice in the field. We know what it is. We know what social justice stands for but what does it look like in practice, in session. So we'll actually have an opportunity to really delve deep into what it looks like. Uh, I'll provide you with a conceptional framework, and we'll actually see it in action. Um, we're going to look at each of these four models through a video demonstration. We're going to have as a client, he goes to see four different therapist. The first one operates through a medical model. The second therapist from a intrapyscho, intrapsychic perspective. The third therapist from a multicultural framework, and the fourth therapist from a social justice paradigm. And this client's going to share her story, same story to four different therapist. And each of the therapist are going to operate from their own paradigm. So, we're really going to see how each therapist lives out their own, uh, theoritic orientation, if you will, in each of these, uh, brief counseling sessions. I'm going to close this session by providing a little uh, uh, critique of each of the four approaches to the counseling. Some of the strengths each therapist brought to their work with this particular client. And also, some of the challenges uh, each of the paradigms they're operating from uh, uh, for the therapist. So, I'm going to talk about each of those as well towards the end. To begin uh, as I mentioned earlier, there's four different paradigms, if you will, that really shaped our understanding of counseling and our practice of counseling. Uh, they shape how we understand human behavior. They shape the type of interactions, interventions we use with clients, and they also shape how we view the counselor role, counselor function uh, in the field. So, that's the medical, intrapsychic, the multicultural, as well as the social justice counseling paradigm. We begin with the medical model. With the medical model human behavior is really understood through the medical sciences. The primary tenants of the medical model are rooted in biology and the hard sciences. The primary focus is looking at client problems from a somatic lens. In other words, therapist, and counselors, and psychologist are really focused on helping alleviate psychical symptoms clients may present in session, in therapy. Often times they'll work with psychiatrist uh, an, and utilize medication to help clients uh, alleviate some of their presenting problems. The psychical symptoms of that they might be presenting in session with a uh, client. Um, therapist who operate from a medical model perspective will often rely on diagnosing to help explain human behavior. The critique on this particular paradigm is that it operates from a deficit model. In other words clients need to change, as clients that come into therapy need to be fixed. Um, the other critique and limitation about this model is that it's limited in terms of really understanding the human experience. Therapist who operate from a medical model perspective ignore larger psychological, sociological, and cultural variables that might help us understand the client's presenting concern from a larger context. So, folks who operate from this particular perspective are really limited in terms of the view on understanding a client problem and human behavior. The second model we're going to look at uh, today is referred to as this intrapsychic model. And it's probably the most predominant model in the field of counseling. It contains and consist of the three primary forces, counseling forces in the field; the psycho analytic, the cognitive behavior, as well as the humanistic perspective in counseling. Within this intrapsychic model, this is where we really see the merging of two different disciplines; the field of biology and the field psychology. The primary role of the counselors understand how psychological variables influence physical variables and how physical symptoms influence psychological well-being and mental health. The role of the counselor is to really help clients gain insight. And so it's really focusing on the client's inner world. What are the clients thoughts, what are their feelings, what's going on inside, uh, and also how does that relate to how they live their life. So looking at client behavior. Diagnosing clients is also very common for folks who operate from an intrapsychic perspective, if you will. Whether they're working from a cognitive behavior paradigm, psycho analytic paradigm or a humanistic uh, paradigm. One of the critiques of counselors and psychologist and therapist who operate from this particular paradigm is that often times the theories that are used from an intrapsychic perspective are also, are often times Eurocentrically based. Uh, and framed around individualism. And the problem with that is that when you're working with clients who operate from a different way of being if you will. For example, client who comes from a collectivistic uh, uh, perspective in life in terms of decisions are made on behalf of the group or by the group, that can be problematic. So, uh, the critique is it tends to be too ethnocentric in focus. Counselors are also who operate from this paradigm you hear the term, are also culturally encapsulated. In other words, they don't really look at how culture plays a part in terms of the client counselor relationship, and also how culture influences the client's world view. That's because counselors who work from this paradigm ignore larger social and cultural contexts uh, that may influence and help us understand the client's presenting problem a little bit better. The third model we're going to look at is the multpsycho-socialicultural model. It's the fourth force in the counseling profession. This is where we see the merging of psychology, biology, as well as sociology uh, in the field. And so client problems are viewed are from a psycho-social traumatic perspective. So we're looking at how to, how to, the client's context and how does their culture influence and shape their lived experience. And how does it also shape their experience with their particular therapist they're working with. Within this particular paradigm you would here the term cultural competence a lot. And what they're referring to is counselors who are aware, knowledgeable and skilled about not only themselves but also the clients and the clients presenting problem, and their background from a cultural lens. So they're aware of themselves, their values, beliefs, and biasses. They're aware of the client's values, beliefs, and biasses. They're knowledgeable about uh, the client's cultural background. And they're skilled in being able to work with clients from a cultural perspective. So, they're really culturally sensitive to a client's way of being. Um, often times counselors in the particular, who operate from this particular paradigm will help clients gain insight into their world but also help them connect, sort of their understanding of their experience to a larger context. So, you hear the term client and context a lot in, in uh, uh, the multicultural uh, model perspective. Where counselors are really helping clients understand their world within a larger context. And the belief is that client's don't exist in the vacuum but they live, they exist in a larger social, political, economic, and cultural context. However, diagnosing is still prevalent uh, for folks who operate in a multicultural perspective. Uh, that has to be in part with uh, what I refer to the additive approach. In other words, what we're really doing is we're taking an existing theory whether it be cutting the behavioral, psycho-analytic, or humanistic uh, model working with client, we're just adding to it. Uh, we're not really changing the mean tenants of a particular theory and that's really problematic because if you're working with a client who has a different way of being, you know, you're taking a theory that doesn't really align and fit with that, with that particular client. I'll go into depth about what I mean about uh, the additive approach in a later slide. The other critique on the multicultural model is that it's really limited in its ability to really help clients seek the types of changes they want. Uh, often times folks who operate from a multicultural lens will help clients understand their world in, in context to help create this, what Paula Ferrar(ph) refers to as critical consciousness. So, clients are aware of their lives and context of a larger society. They're aware that perhaps systemic factors, environmental variables maybe influencing their presenting problem but that's sort of where it stops. You don't really see, you don't really hear a lot about therapist who operate from a multicultural perspective focusing on systems interventions. Uh, and that's where the social justice paradigm comes into play. This is where you hear uh, what I refer to bio-social, bio-psycho-social -advocacy model of counseling. Where we're really focused on uh, uh, systemic interventions. I refer to the social justice model as the fifth force in the field. Uh, this is where we focus on counselors being advocates, not just in session but also out of session. Uh, client problems are viewed from a psycho-social traumatic perspective with a oppression framework. Uh, we're looking how large external variables and how issues of inequity, and issues of injustice contribute to client's uh, mental health and well-being. Counselors who operate from a social justice perspective need to be advocacy competent. I'll talk a little bit more about what advocacy competence entails in a later slide. Counselors who work from a social justice paradigm really try to understand the client's lived experience and also try to understand whether individual counseling, one-on-one counseling, uh, office based interventions are necessary. Or whether a systemic interventions are necessary. In other words, whether or not a counselor needs to step outside from the comfort of their office setting and work in the environment, so we're talking about community engagement. Or whether a combination of both is necessary. And a lot of that is determined based on the client's presenting problem and through dialogue with a, with a client. So, really the social justice perspective sort of takes the multicultural movement and the multicultural perspective which started in the '60's and '70's takes it one step further by looking at perhaps system changes necessary. Because if, if it's the system, if it's the environment that's contributing to client's stress, then maybe perhaps we should focus our interventions on changing the environment and not changing the client, you know. Um, one of the many critiques about the social justice movement, the social justice perspective you hear a lot in the field is that it's too political, it's too value laden. Which is not what counseling is about. Counseling is a very value neutral, uh, uh, "helping field". Um, so that's one of the critiques you hear and why partially people aren't, you know, as open to uh, uh, integrating social justice into their work with clients. Um, the other I think critique on the social justice counseling is that there's not a lot of models out there about, how do operationalize social justice. What does it look like when I'm working with a client one-on-one on therapy? I know, what social justice is. I can define it. I've read a lot about it in the literature but what does it look like in practicing. So, that's what we're really going to be focusing on today is the social justice perspective and what it actually looks like in practice. So, this is just a snap shot of the predominant models in counseling. You can sort of look at it as a sort of evolutionary process in terms of how we've grown and moved from a medical perspective, biological perspective understanding human behavior to an intrapsychic perspective looking at human behavior through the lens of biology and psychology. To the multicultural perspective which looks at how does sociological variables influence mental health and the physical symptoms that client's might be presenting. So, looking at intersection of biology, psychology, and sociology. And then too, where we're at now, the social justice perspective in counseling. Which is looking at, is advocacy needed, micro-mesolevel forms of advocacy, mesolevel forms of advocacy, and micro-macrolevel forms of advocacy. Is that needed in my work with this particular client based on what the client is sharing. So, this, you can sort of look at this from a sort of evolutionary perspective. Another way of looking at it is, we've gone from a reactive sort of model where we react to what client's presenting to a more prevention based proactive model. Where we're focused on going on to the community doing systems based work, which can really strengthen our work, one-on-one with clients in therapy. In spite of a lot of the movement we've been able to make in the multicultural, social justice field, we continue to utilize psychology to preserve the status quo. Um, Perla Tenski talks about that, how we use psychology really to, to maintain the social order of things. Uh, partly has to do with the fact that we're using 'The Master's Tools'. Uh, it's a term utilized by Audrey Ward, who's a social critic um, and cultural critic. And what she says is you can't utilize 'The Master's Tools" to dismantle the master's house, you can't utilize 'The Master's Tools' to dismantle the master's house. And what she's talking about is that 'The Master's Tools' were meant to hold the status quo. So you can't utilize those tools to create social change because they weren't meant to dismantle issues, uh, issues of equity. They were meant to maintain a system of, of dominance for some and disadvantage for others. So, within the counseling profession what we're finding is that counselors, in-spite of all the research we know about multiculturalism in social justice continue to operate from a medical and intrapsychic perspective. We continue to utilize Eurocentric based models to work with clients. And the problem with that is often times those models are ethnocentric in, in perspective and they also focus on the individual and are often office based. So, we're not looking at focusing on and, and going out to the communities and working. The other thing counselors often do to sort of preserve the status quo in the field of psychology and counseling is we take an additive, we take an additive approach to our work with clients, to our theoretic orientation. So, may revise our particular theory, for example, cognitive behavior as we added mulitcultural flavor to their theoretic orientation. But the main tenants of that theory are still the same. Uh, so nothings really changed, we sort of tweaked and added on to a particular theory. And the problem with that is we're utilizing a theory that was developed for a particular population, a Euro-American population which is fine. But when you utilize it with a particular client who comes from a different, different cultural frame of reference that can be problematic, we have a problem. Uh, and that's why we see a lot of client's of color leaving therapy within the first session. A lot, often times because they're not feeling connected with their client or with their particular counselor that they're working with because they don't feel like the counselor's sensitive to their cultural way of being. The other thing that helps preserve the status quo in the field of psychology and counseling is this concept of neutrality. We often evaluate students in counselor training programs in terms of their ability to be, their ability to be value neutral in their work with clients. Uh, and so as clients, counselors have to sort of put up this invisible wall or vail of where they shouldn't share too much of themselves. Uh, the focus is really on the client and the client's inner world, and their world. And the counselors really have to sort of step back and really act value neutral and focus more on the micro-skills. Paraphrasing, help them change their thoughts and feelings and behavior. And Perla Tenski talks about this and he says, that's problematic because often times the issues clients come to therapy with aren't neutrally based. They're laden with political implications, with social implications, and cultural implications. And we need to bring that out in our work with clients. The other reason is it's hard for counselors to really operate from a social justice uh, multicultural framework is because we ourselves, as counselor educators and counseling psychologist aren't doing a very good job of training our students in their training programs. There's a lack of content on social advocacy in the curriculum in, in, in counselor education and counselor psychology programs. There's a lack of uh, uh, content on community engagement. We focus a lot of our efforts on helping clients or helping counselors develop micro-skills; one-on-one skills with counselors, with clients, within a traditional office setting. What we don't do a very good job of presenting and really going deep into community engagement. What is it look like? How do we train counselors to work in the community? How do we train counselors to work with religious leaders? How do we train counselors to work with legislatures? Who do we train counselors to be political but also respectful of clients and the communities that they work in? Uh, and so, we can't blame practitioners uh, for their inability or, or, to really enact social advocacy and social change, and social justice tenants. When we ourselves aren't doing a very good job preparing them for the field. The other thing I found in terms of my travels across the country, is that we don't do a very good job of helping counselors develop into social changes agents. In terms of identifying and really forming that social change agent identity. On the other hand, we do a very good job in helping them develop their professional identity as counselors or as psychologist. We encourage them to join professional organizations to get involved, to present at workshops, to really understand what does it mean to be a psychologist. To really understand what does it mean to be a therapist, a counselor. So, you know, that way when clients or counselors walk out of their training programs, they have a good foundation about what it means to uh, be a counselor because they've really been educated on professional formation of being a counselor. Not really on what does it mean to be a social change agent and how do I connect into that identity. And does it even fit with me on what a social change agent counselor look like and how would that be different from a regular counselor. So we don't really focus on that a lot in the field. Which I think also attributes, contributes to the lack of social justice uh, in the counseling profession. And the other thing I've notices is, is really a complacency on the part of the counseling profession as a whole. We don't really have that sense of urgency about the needs to develop a social justice paradigm. About the need to incorporate social justice into our work with clients. Um, and I think that's problematic. Uh, because when we don't have this sense of urgency, what Martin Luther King refers to as, 'the fierce urgency of now'. Uh, it doesn't really move us to really uh, look at working with clients in new ways. And that's really problematic because clients are often times coming to therapy, coming to session with problems that are not, that are not just internally based but also connected to their larger social, political, and economic conditions. For example, in the research one of the things we're finding is that racial segregation has a real psychological impact on the mental health well-being of people in society. Um, the other thing we're finding is that gay and lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning students are struggling in schools because of the culture of homophobia and heterosexism that exists in schools. To the point where it's impacting their ability to achieve uh, academically. So, there's actually an LGBTQ achievement gap uh, according to the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network. When students don't feel safe they don't perform better in the classroom or not able to perform to their optimal best because their focused on safety needs, Masal's hierarchy of needs. Basic needs of safety and shelter are not being met, it's harder to focus on higher order needs. Uh, in this particular case learning. There's a lot of objectification of women in the media which leads to issue to low self-esteem, which leads to body issues. Uh, and so these are some of the examples how client problems are externally based. And because they're externally based we need to be able to look at how we might be able to alter the external environment not just altering clients inner world. Their thoughts and feelings and behaviors. So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are well-meaning, who are client centered, and who mean well but who also So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are are very ill-equipped to deal with the realities of what client's So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are are presenting with, them with. Um, and the ramifications are really So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are drastic on clients. Uh, a couple examples, So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are clients who work with therapist who operate from miniature psychic So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are and sometimes multicultural and medical paradigm uh, So we have a lot of well-intention counselors in the field who are seek long-term changes. And then when they work with clients from the medical, intrapsychic, mutlicultural framework the changes that they seek are really short lived, they're short termed. Partly because we're not getting down to the core root of client problems. You know, we're just sort of providing a band-aid effect, maybe while focus on changing their and altering a client's thought process to help them understand their world a little bit better. Which in the short-term can, can, can lead to positive changes for a client but in the long term uh, it doesn't really change their environment. So, in the long term uh, it, it, the long term effects are minimal. Uh, but we operate from a medical to psychic and multicultural framework at times. Uh, we also place blame on a client in a sense that we require the client to change as oppose to their environment. So the focus of therapy, the predominant focus is really helping clients change versus helping clients understand their environment, and helping to alter their environment. So that way their environment changes to adapt to the clients way of being. I'm going to talk a little bit more about the social justice paradigm and really address the question of how do you operationalize social justice and practices. This is really a common question I get from folks in the field, uh, students and practitioners. I view myself. What I hear often is folks saying, I view myself as a social change agent. I have a social justice identity, how do I live it out. How do I uh, uh, implement it to my work with clients. So I'm going to present with you a model about what's uh, social justice counseling looks like. Which can hopefully provide you with a framework in terms of working with clients on a social justice paradigm. The core of this social justice model that I developed is multicultural competent. I think to be a really effective social change agent, to be a really effective social advocate, address issues of inequity and injustice that clients present you really need to be grounded in terms of multicultural competence. Counselors need to be aware, knowledgeable, skilled in terms of the client's cultural background, they need to be aware of their values, beliefs, and biases. They need to be knowledgeable of various multicultural theories. As well as skills in the types of interventions that might be more appropriate for a particular client based on their cultural frame of reference. They need to also understand how culture influences the client counselor relationship. It could be a barrier to the therapy relationship or it could be something that's positive in the therapy relationship. Regardless counselors need to be cognizant of that from a multicultural perspective. So, the core of the social justice counseling model that I'm going to present is really multicultural competence. Counselors need to also be aware of the different facets of their identity as well as the identity of their clients. Because all of that comes into play in our work with clients. Aspects of identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, spirituality, religion, aging, dark target group identities, as well as uh, aspects of privilege, age. All factor into a client's world view. How a client experiences her or his world and also facets into the client counselor relationship. Uh, a counselor really needs to be aware of different facets that make up client's identity as well as the counselor's identity. And figure out how does that shape the coun-, the client counselor relationship and how does that shape the client's experience in their world. In other words, how does being an Asian-American therapist experience influence one's experience in, in their therapy with clients. How does being an African-American influence a client's particular experience in society and the world. And that's important because Hardimen Jackson speaks to this, and that's that, oppression exist on three different levels. There's individual forms of oppression, there's social cultural forms of oppression. As well as, institutional forms of oppression. Individual forms of oppression really have to do with individual interactions with other people that are oppressive in nature. That could be name calling, that could be bullying, for example. Or some sort of slythe or attitude one might have toward a particular person based on their race or ethnicity, their gender, their sexuality, so on and so forth. Social cultural forms of oppression according to Hardimen Jackson, have to deal with the values and norms imbedded in our society. Uh, one of the cultural norms in society that are maintained by those in power. So if you look at issues of racism uh, the social norm is individuality, individualism uh, supersedes uh, uh, folks who live from a collective assisted perspective. If you look at issues of sexual orientation, you know, uh, one of the cultural norms in U.S. society is heterosexual relationships are value. Uh, gay, lesbian, bisexual and even transgender relationships aren't as values as highly. So, that's a social norm in our society. That's a social, cultural form of oppression that exists in society. A third form of oppression is more systematic, institutional forms of oppression. What are the laws and policies and regulations that exist uh, that either are intentionally or unintentionally uh, create barriers for client's ability to achieve academically career wise, as well as personal and social. So, oppression exist on three different levels and because they exist on three different levels, we as therapist, we as counselors need to explore that. Uh, so we need to look at how does aspects of a client's identity, their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality shape their understanding of their world. And how does living in an environment that is oppressive shape their experience in the world. How does individual forms of oppression influence their presenting problem. How does social, cultural forms of oppression influence and factor into a clients presenting problem. How does institutional forms of oppression influence a client's presenting problem. And how do we as therapist help client's understand the individual social, cultural, and institutional forms of oppression in our work with clients. So that's really important to really look at uh, when we operate from a social justice perspective. Understanding that, not just how oppression exist but also how client problems are connected with the different levels of oppression. So when we have an understanding on how the different forms of oppression impact clients cognitively, ethically, behaviorally, as well as biologically that can really help us really gain a really more comprehensive picture of a client's experience. Which is important because that can help us determine whether or not microlevel, mesolevel, and or macrolevel interventions are necessary in our work with clients. Microlevel interventions are really interventions that take place in the traditional office setting. They're really one-on-one in nature. Uh, and it's really I think an area where counselors really feel equipped and confident in terms of being able to work with clients from this particular level. Uh, because it's what we've been trained to do. Uh, for the most part which is how do we work with a client in the traditional office setting. How do we help them understand their thoughts, and feelings, and behaviors uh, in the context of a larger society. The mesolevel form of advocacy is a little more difficult because it requires us to step outside from the comfort of our office setting. It requires us to sort of expand uh, the type of work that we can really do with clients by looking at how we can alter social, cultural norms uh, in our society. Macrolevel takes it even one step further and looks at how can we be involved politically. What legislative policy, what bills are in place that impede on our client's ability to achieve optimal psychological health and well-being. When we look at each of these forms of, of intervention at the microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel I think we, it's fair to say that we tend to focus more on the microlevel. I'm going to talk a little bit about how we can also look at altering and intervening at the mesolevel and how we can alter and intervene at the macrolevel. So, I'll give some, an example of what this might look like with a client who may identify with being gay, lesbian, bisexual and or transgender. So, I'm going to sort of go back a few slides uh, a little bit. So, we have a counselor who's working with a client, who identifies with being lesbian. Uh, counselor who operates from a social justice framework really is able to understand how that identity really shapes a client's uh, frame of reference. They begin to explore how a client presenting problem might be influenced by individual forms of oppression, might be formed by social, cultural forms of oppression, and also institutional forms of oppression. So, an individual form of oppression might be particular uh, uh, attitude, a slight, a look somebody might have uh, towards a client based on her uh, uh, lesbian identity. A social, cultural form of oppression might the cultural norms that we hold in America about sexuality. In America, the notion of being in a heterosexual relationship is very valued, highly valued in, in our country. Being in a gay, lesbian, bisexual, and even transgender relationship is devalued in our country a lot. So, a client comes in, identifies with being a lesbian. Lives in a society that doesn't really embrace her way of being uh, in the world. And then in an institutional form of oppression might me a particular law or legislation that's been passed that doesn't really embrace that client's particular aspect of their identity. So, one of the things that's really big in this country in terms of a debate, is the notion of gay marriage. We're seeing a lot of states right now enacting laws that say marriage is between a man and a woman, uh, and solely that. If you're in a lesbian relationship, same-sex relationship that your relationship isn't really acknowledged legally. So that's an example how an institutional form of oppression can indirectly impede on a client's sense of self, sense of self-worth. So, we have this understanding that this client lives in a world that isn't necessarily accepting of her, may be interacting with people who are homophobic, lives in a community where the culture embraces heterosexual relationships and lives in a country that has enacted, in a state that has enacted laws around what is considered a normal relationship and what's considered an abnormal relationship, and health, healthy relationship, and an unhealthy relationship. And so we can look at how does that impact the client cognitively. Perhaps she's having negative self thoughts about herself because she doesn't fit with her peer group. Perhaps she's having negative thoughts because she doesn't fit with larger society. That might impact her affectively. She might feel depressed, uh, display symptoms of low self-esteem, really feel down about herself because she's not really fitting in with the larger dominant group. Which might impact her ability to live in a world that isn't really accepting of her. So she might not uh, uh, she might have a harder time going to work, might have harder time going to school. Might not be able to live her optimal best because of the crutches society has sort of placed on her. And that might impact her biologically. She might not be able to sleep a lot because she's having all these negative thoughts about herself, about not being able to fit in. She might develop symptoms that are ulcer-like in nature because of some of the things that are happening in her world. That understanding can really help us figure out whether or not we need to intervene at the microlevel, mesolevel, and or macrolevel. I'll give you an example of a counselor who might be able to work with a client at the microlevel. Uh, specifically with this particular lesbian client. At the microlevel a counselor can help empower the client by helping them understand the situation and context, and help the client really perhaps realize maybe it's not them that's going crazy it's their environment that's contributing to their 'psychological instability'. And so it's the environment that is maybe helping the client reshape their environment, alter their environment a little bit. So, helping at the microlevel is really about focusing on externalizing what the client has internalized. How can I do that in the traditional office setting. At the mesolevel, well the counselor's really focus on, on is altering social, cultural norms and beliefs. And so it might mean going out to the community, working with community agencies, develop programing in schools to develop education in the community about the importance of valuing and embracing, and being affirming of all sorts of relationships, not just heterosexual relationships. So, just through education and program in of it self can help at least alter some of the cultural norms about what's healthy, what's considered a healthy relationships and what are considered unhealthy relationships. At the macrolevel, counselors can work with legislatures at the state level as well as the federal level to enact laws or change laws or policies who might inhibit a counselor's ability to really uh, uh, give their optimal best. So, in this particular case, a counselor might work with her state legislature, either send an email or uh, uh, federal constituents uh, in terms of enacting laws and policies, or changing laws and policies around issues related to gay marriage for example. Which may not have a direct impact on a client but can help sort of create that environment where a client feels that they are accepted because of who they are. Um, so those are some of the examples of intervening with the client at the microlevel, the macrolevel, as well as the mesolevel. Having that understanding is important because it allows us to really look at the type of interventions we need to employ. Based on the client's identity, based on their presenting concern, based on our understanding of how oppression impacts influencing a client's presented problem. We can figure out the best way to work with a client. Given the client's presenting problem, is it ideal for me to work on a microlevel one-on-one with client best, that's all I need to do. Is just focus on one-on-one with a client in a traditional office setting. Or do I need to look at altering the social cultural context, altering cultural norm like implementing mesolevel forms of advocacy. Or if macrolevels forms of advocacy are necessary because the problems clients are presenting are institutionally based. Uh, they're oppressive institutionally. So, if they are perhaps by focus needs to be on macrolevels interventions. So do I need to work with the client based on the problem at the microlevel, mesolevel or the macrolevel, or a combination of the three necessary in my particular work with clients. So, when I talk about social justice and what that is, this is a model that I think will provide us with the conceptual framework for really looking at helping client's understanding their situation in context of a larger oppressive uh, society. What we're going to do now is we're going to go and, and we're going to watch four separate counseling sessions. So, it's going to be a client who comes in shares the same story to four different therapist. The first therapist is going to operate from a medical perspective. The second therapist is going to operate from an intrapsychic perspective, looking at psychological variables and biological variables and how they shape the client's understanding of their world. The third therapist will operate from a multicultural framework, looking at how social concepts really influences a client's presenting issues and how cultural variables shape the counselor and client relationship. The fourth therapist will operate from a social justice framework connecting biology, psychology, sociology, with advocacy. And asking the question, given the client's presenting problem does microlevel, mesolevel, macrolevel forms of interventions necessary or a combination the three necessary in order for clients to really uh, uh, be able to achieve their optimal best.

00:44:05
THERAPIST Hi, Bridgette, thank you for coming in today. How can I be of help? 

00:44:10
BRIDGETTE Um, I guess I'm just kind of looking for somebody to talk to and maybe just kind of say something about how I've been feeling. That's pretty much it. 

00:44:25
THERAPIST Can you tell me more about what's been going on that brought you in? 

00:44:25
BRIDGETTE Um, I've just been feeling really, I don't know, not very happy lately and tired. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep at night. Um, I haven't been going to school very much. I just haven't been feeling very good about myself lately. 

00:44:45
THERAPIST It sounds rough. How long would you say this has been going on? 

00:44:55
BRIDGETTE Hmm. Maybe since the beginning of school this year, so the past three months. 

00:45:00
THERAPIST Three months, Okay. So, for the past three months you've been feeling down um, and not very good about yourself. Was there any particular thing that happened that, that set these symptoms off you think. 

00:45:15
BRIDGETTE I guess I just feel I haven't been really connected with the kids at school lately. Um, I don't really have many friends. 

00:45:25
THERAPIST Mmm, okay. And that's made you feel sad? 

00:45:30
BRIDGETTE Yeah. I just feel like I can't. I don't have anybody to talk to about anything. Um, I've been kind of frustrated about that. 

00:45:40
THERAPIST Okay. So, you said, you've been feeling sad and you also mentioned having trouble sleeping. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:45:50
BRIDGETTE Um, yeah, I just haven't been able to sleep at night. I go lay down and I don't know, I've just been waking up a lot. 

00:46:00
THERAPIST During the night you've been waking up? 

00:46:00
BRIDGETTE Mm-hmm. 

00:46:05
THERAPIST And so how is your energy level been over the same three month period? 

00:46:10
BRIDGETTE It's been really low. I've just felt very tired and exhausted and not wanting to stay at school too long. 

00:46:20
THERAPIST Okay. Is there anything else that you've noticed during this same period of time in the way that you've been thinking or feeling? 

00:46:25
BRIDGETTE I guess I've been feeling really just separated from everybody, like I feel like I don't have anyone to hang out with or I don't know. I just wish that it, that I had more friends. I wish that I could be like everybody else. 

00:46:45
THERAPIST Huh. What do you mean like everybody else? 

00:46:50
BRIDGETTE I just, normal. Um, accpeted. 

00:46:55
THERAPIST Yeah, that's important especially in high school. Um, why do you not feel accepted or what is it about you that makes you feel like the other kids? 

00:47:05
BRIDGETTE I guess in the past people have made remarks, um, just remarks about me being gay. 

00:47:15
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:47:15
BRIDGETTE Or assumptions about me being gay. 

00:47:20
THERAPIST And that's, they've not been kind or? 

00:47:25
BRIDGETTE No, they've just rude about it like, you know. 

00:47:25
THERAPIST I see. 

00:47:25
BRIDGETTE Quit acting like a fag and you know, quit being gay. 

00:47:35
THERAPIST That must be very difficult. And so you think that's been contributing to your feelings, feeling down and not feeling good about yourself. 

00:47:40
BRIDGETTE Yeah, I feel different, you know, and unwanted. 

00:47:45
THERAPIST Okay. During the same period of time that you've been feeling bad have you noticed that you stopped doing activities that you used to enjoy, um, things that might have been pleasurable in the past. 

00:48:00
BRIDGETTE I used to like school. 

00:48:05
THERAPIST Okay. And schools not going so well now. Are you having trouble with your classes? 

00:48:15
BRIDGETTE I'm not doing good in any of my classes. I'm getting Ds and Fs. 

00:48:20
THERAPIST Oh, oh, that's rough. Yeah. How's your thinking? Are you having difficulty concentrating or focusing at school? 

00:48:30
BRIDGETTE Yeah, I just, I just get there and I'm tired. I don't want to deal with people, you know, saying rude things. And, I leave, I can't handle it. 

00:48:45
THERAPIST So you've mentioned quite a few things to me. That in the past few months you've been feeling sad, and you haven't felt very good about yourself. Um, you've had low energy and um, your not concentrating doing very well in school. Um, have you noticed anything else uh, has your appetite changed or your weight significantly in the same time frame. 

00:49:10
BRIDGETTE Maybe. I mean, I don't really eat dinner anymore. 

00:49:15
THERAPIST Ah, have you lost weight as a result of that do you think? 

00:49:20
BRIDGETTE Maybe, a little bit. 

00:49:20
THERAPIST Okay. Um, sometimes when people are feeling down they have thoughts that they might want to harm themselves or um, have you had any thoughts about suicide or any feelings like you wish you weren't here? 

00:49:40
BRIDGETTE No, I don't, I don't wish I wasn't here. I just want to be liked. I just want to be normal. 

00:49:45
THERAPIST Okay. All right. Okay. Um, is there anything else that you would like to share with me that you've been feeling or thinking about over the last three months. 

00:50:00
BRIDGETTE I identify as a lesbian. 

00:50:00
THERAPIST Okay. 

00:50:00
BRIDGETTE And it's something that I maybe wish was different about myself. 

00:50:10
THERAPIST Mmm. I see, so you're having, you're having some struggles with that identity or feelings about that? 

00:50:20
BRIDGETTE Well, I guess just with people's perceptions of me. 

00:50:20
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

00:50:20
BRIDGETTE i just want to be like everybody else and live a normal life. 

00:50:25
THERAPIST Okay. And the, what's been going on in school has created some feelings in you. This sadness and wishing to be different. Yeah. Well, I think it's important that you came and talked to me. I think that's very brave of you. I just have a couple more questions. I'm just wondering um, if you drink alcohol, Bridgette? 

00:50:50
BRIDGETTE No. 

00:50:50
THERAPIST Okay. Um, do you take drugs of any kind? 

00:50:55
BRIDGETTE Mm-mm. 

00:50:55
THERAPIST Okay. How about medications for any medical problems that you might have? 

00:51:00
BRIDGETTE No. I just, I just take vitamins. 

00:51:05
THERAPIST Okay. All right. Well, um, you've told me about a lot of different symptoms that you've had over the last three months. And um, it certainly sounds like because of what's going on at school and how your feeling about it you've been quite depressed. Is that how you've been thinking about this? Does that make sense to you? 

00:51:25
BRIDGETTE I guess that makes sense. 

00:51:30
THERAPIST Um, I think its, like I said, it's important to take the first step to come and talk to me. Depression um, can be very difficult to live with but it's also very treatable. And um, therapy can be very helpful for that. Uh, I think it's important that you came and talked to me and we can continue doing that but I um, would like to say that sometimes for people that are depressed one of the first things that I would recommend is to consider antidepressant medication for your symptoms. And if you're willing to think about that I would refer you to a practitioner or psychiatrist who's an expert at medications. And um, that person would assess what kind would be best for you and um, prescribe that um, and deal with that. But then you could continue to come back and see me for therapy. 

00:52:25
BRIDGETTE What exactly would that involve? 

00:52:25
THERAPIST Well, that's a good question. Thanks for asking. Um, again I think that um, what's beneficial about medications for some people um, regardless what caused our depression we believe that um, certain chemicals in our brain are affected, particularly cretonne. You've heard of that, um, the low, the lower levels of these chemicals can cause the symptoms that you're having. So, the feeling bad about yourself, the difficulty sleeping, the difficulty concentrating all those symptoms are related to that. And the medications act on those brain chemicals and will increase the levels so that you'll feel better relatively quickly. Therapy is an important step but it can be, take a little longer and um, medications can act relatively quickly within a few weeks. So that would be one reason I would recommend that for you. I think that you have a number of symptoms. Again you, everything that you described to me um, fits with the diagnoses of having major depressive episode. Um, the insomnia, the feeling bad about yourself, the decreased concentration, the fatigue. Um, and the medications will help with those symptoms relatively quickly. The other thing I'd like to mention is that um, when you're not feeling very good about yourself and you're not thinking very clearly sometimes it's hard to focus on therapy or really participate that well. And I think that um, medications can help in that as well. So, that when you're feeling a little better and thinking more clearly you'll be more motivated to talk about what's been going on in school, how you've been feeling. I think that would really help with your recovery. 

00:54:15
BRIDGETTE Is there, I guess, is there any risks involved in taking? 

00:54:20
THERAPIST No. 

00:54:20
BRIDGETTE Medications? 

00:54:20
THERAPIST Yeah, well um, all medications do have side-effects and there's potential risks involved. The good news about anti-depressant medication is that um, there's millions of prescriptions that have been written and they're very well tolerated by most people. Um, side-effects that we, we discuss more thoroughly by the psychiatrist include nausea and some people have trouble with anxiety or sexual side-effects. But again um, most people tolerate them very well and uh, your prescriber can fully answer those questions. I think um, if that's something you're interested in I could refer you to a psychiatrist but I would really like to um, continue therapy with you. And after you've seen that provider um, we could continue therapy, if you'd like to come back next week? 

00:55:15
BRIDGETTE I think that sounds like a good idea. Help me feel better 

00:55:20
THERAPIST okay.

THERAPIST Hello Bridgette. 

00:55:25
BRIDGETTE Hi. 

00:55:25
THERAPIST Nice to see you. 

00:55:25
BRIDGETTE Nice to meet you. 

00:55:55
THERAPIST What would you like to talk about today? 

00:56:00
BRIDGETTE Um, I guess I'm just hear to talk about how I've been feeling lately. 

00:56:00
THERAPIST Okay, that's like a good place to start. 

00:56:05
BRIDGETTE Um, I've just been feeling really tired and um, just kind of frustrated and down, and sad a lot. 

00:56:15
THERAPIST Mmm. 

00:56:15
BRIDGETTE I just haven't been feeling happy. 

00:56:20
THERAPIST Tired, frustrated, down, sad a lot, not very happy, that sounds like a load. How do you experience the tiredness or the sadness, or the downness? Like in your body anywhere? Just tell me some more about that experience. 

00:56:40
BRIDGETTE I guess a a lot of the time I just feel like, kind of exhausted in terms of like, I just feel like I'm not uplifted. 

00:56:55
THERAPIST Mmm. I noticed when you did that, you, you kind of lifted your own shoulders. I was curious that suggested to me something you might have some power to lift your own spirits, sometime. I don't know how it felt to you but that's what ran through my mind. Okay. 

00:57:10
BRIDGETTE Yeah. I guess, yeah, I haven't been feeling that I, that I have the power in me. 

00:57:15
THERAPIST Feeling more like this. 

00:57:20
BRIDGETTE Mm-hmm. 

00:57:20
THERAPIST Can you, can you assume this position a little bit and just she how that feels. Is that more like how you feeling than, than this. Okay, okay. Well, I interrupted you. What, what else about any of this did you want to talk about? 

00:57:40
BRIDGETTE Well, um, I just feel like I've been kind of alone lately. 

00:57:45
THERAPIST Mmm. 

00:57:45
BRIDGETTE Like I haven't had anyone to talk to. 

00:57:50
THERAPIST Mmm. 

00:57:50
BRIDGETTE Um. 

00:57:50
THERAPIST And, and how about right now, is, are you still feeling some of that aloneness right now. 

00:57:55
BRIDGETTE I think so. 

00:57:55
THERAPIST Yeah. I can imagine, this is a brand new setting. We haven't met each other before. And when you're feeling alone, what is it that you experience about this aloneness. Is it in your head, is it somewhere in your body? Do you get a picture of yourself being alone or what's it like? 

00:58:20
BRIDGETTE I guess I kind of feel it in both. Like I definitely feel tired. 

00:58:25
THERAPIST Mmm. 

00:58:25
BRIDGETTE But I think about being alone, I think about not having any friends. 

00:58:35
THERAPIST Mmm. 

00:58:35
BRIDGETTE And I'm different. 

00:58:40
THERAPIST Mmm can you give me an example of a time recently that you felt really quite alone, that you didn't have any friends. Tell me the setting. 

00:58:45
BRIDGETTE Um, I was in class and it was Math class. And I have some girlfriends and they were just kind of making fun of another guy in our class and how he was acting really gay. And I got really pissed off I was angry. And my friends like, you're over-reacting, like cut it out, it's not a big deal. Like what are you a fag. I don't know, I just felt like I was frustrated and I kept telling them not to be. And I didn't know how not to be angry. 

00:59:25
THERAPIST Hmm. What was your experience when, well you already told me that you were feeling angry. Can you tell me anything about your experience anything else about your experience when they said, what are you a fag. 

00:59:45
BRIDGETTE I guess I was kind of hurt. 

00:59:45
THERAPIST Mmm. 

00:59:45
BRIDGETTE And maybe, maybe a little scared. 

00:59:50
THERAPIST Mmm. Can you put it in any more words to that scared? Something that might of been running through your mind? 

01:00:00
BRIDGETTE I guess. 

01:00:00
THERAPIST Something you felt in your body? 

01:00:05
BRIDGETTE I was kind of afraid that maybe that they did know. 

01:00:05
THERAPIST They did know what? 

01:00:10
BRIDGETTE Uh, that I was gay. 

01:00:15
THERAPIST So you were afraid that they would know. Now I appreciate that you're telling me that. This is new information obviously to me. When you say you're afraid that they would find that you're gay um, how do you experience gayness. Sometimes I talk to kids and they say, well I'm gay or I'm afraid I'm gay, or I don't know if I'm gay. Can you tell me some more about, and then again please set your own limits, what you're comfortable with because we just met. Um, what is your own experience of our gayness? How does it manifest, how does it show up, or what's you're experience? 

01:01:00
BRIDGETTE I guess I'm, I've always just kind of been attracted to like to women. 

01:01:05
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

01:01:05
BRIDGETTE Um, and I know that, that's what's wrong with me. 

01:01:10
THERAPIST You know that, that's what's wrong with you that you felt attracted to women. Um, those are two really important statements. I'd like to unpack each one just a little bit. Is that okay? You've always been attracted to women. Can you give me some examples of that. 

01:01:30
BRIDGETTE Um. 

01:01:30
THERAPIST By the way I'm not trying to check you out and really test if you're really gay. I'm just interested in what is your own experience of you're saying that you are gay. Okay. 

01:01:40
BRIDGETTE I guess I started when I was a little bit younger and I had a crush on a girl. 

01:01:50
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

01:01:50
BRIDGETTE Um, I just wanted her to like me. 

01:01:55
THERAPIST Mmm. Okay. And um, anything else about that? 

01:02:00
BRIDGETTE Maybe, maybe fantasize it. 

01:02:10
THERAPIST How old were you at that time do you remember? 

01:02:15
BRIDGETTE I think I was 15 maybe freshman year. 

01:02:15
THERAPIST Okay. And when you say, uh, liking to be with her to you mean sexually or just being her friend? 

01:02:25
BRIDGETTE I mean the sexual way. 

01:02:30
THERAPIST Sexually. I appreciate you telling me that. That's pretty private stuff. Okay. Have there been other examples or situations when you felt that way. 

01:02:50
BRIDGETTE I mean I guess, I've been attracted to different women but I haven't liked anyone like I liked her. 

01:02:55
THERAPIST That was really special. Is she still special to you right now? 

01:03:05
[sil.] 

01:03:10
BRIDGETTE Not really. 

01:03:10
THERAPIST Not really. So that sort of came and went. 

01:03:15
BRIDGETTE I mean I had a crush on her and I would try and hang out with her but she would just make comments all the time about, you know, me acting gay or. 

01:03:25
THERAPIST Oh. Okay. 

01:03:25
BRIDGETTE So, we're not really friends anymore. 

01:03:30
THERAPIST I see so, that was probably pretty hurtful for you when she would do that. And I can imagine if she was somebody that you felt really special about, to have her reject you like that was pretty hurtful. Yeah. Especially after you've already told me that you were feeling quite a lone at school. So, here's this one special connection you were hoping for and it gets cut off. 

01:03:55
BRIDGETTE Yeah. 

01:03:55
THERAPIST Boy. 

01:04:00
BRIDGETTE It hurt a lot. 

01:04:00
THERAPIST Yeah, I bet it hurt a lot. We'll probably come back to that if that's okay. But I wanted to ask you something else. You said, that you were afraid that they would find out that you are gay, and that's what's wrong with you. Something to that affect. I heard you say the word wrong. Is that how you feel about it? 

01:04:25
BRIDGETTE I guess I just feel like I wish that I wasn't so that I can have friends and be accepted. 

01:04:30
THERAPIST So you wish you weren't gay, or I'm going to translate it just a little bit and say, you wish you didn't focus so much on girls or women so that you would have more friends. Is, is that accurate or am I putting words in your mouth? 

01:04:50
BRIDGETTE Yeah, I just, I, I want people to like me. 

01:04:50
THERAPIST Okay. 

01:04:55
BRIDGETTE I want to be able to talk to people and I don't feel like I can right now. 

01:05:00
THERAPIST So, you feel that you have to hold back sometimes. Like kind of guard and protect yourself from, from more fully expressing your ideas and your feelings and your thoughts. Yeah. Well no wonder you feel down, no, and that takes a lot of energy. No wonder you feel tired. So somewhere you have come to believe that if you are gay, if you have a preference or interest in other girls or women there's something wrong with that. Do you know where that comes from? 

01:05:45
BRIDGETTE I guess it comes from like, just my family and friends, them making homophobic remarks and. 

01:05:55
THERAPIST Okay. And then you hear homophobic remarks from family and friends, I've asked this before but I'd just like to know if there's any other thoughts, or feelings, or sensations that come up for you. Because I'm interested in thoughts, and in feelings, and in sensations any where because I think they're all really important, they're all valid. 

01:06:20
BRIDGETTE I guess like when I'm at home and, you know, my parents are making remarks about, you know, gays being you know repulsive I just, I don't know it's like it, I'm mixed. I'm, I'm angry and I'm frustrated. And I, I guess I can feel kind of like I get really hot. 

01:06:40
THERAPIST Mmm. 

01:06:40
BRIDGETTE And like my heart starts racing but I'm also just like, terrified. 

01:06:45
THERAPIST Mmm. Hot, um, frustrated. I noticed your hands were going like this. Is there something your hands might want to do or say? 

01:07:00
BRIDGETTE I just want to scream or break something. 

01:07:00
THERAPIST You want to break something? I think it's wonderful that you are able to articulate all of this. I think it's very important. So kids I talk to, they say, I don't know I just feel mad. Here you've told me you feel angry, you feel frustrated, you clinch your fist. You want to break something. I hope you don't go out and break somebody or something but I'm really glad that you are able to name all of that for yourself. I think those are wonderful resources that you have. Some kids are not able to do that. Those are the kind of resources that we can work with. Because I'm sitting here thinking even with what little you've told me so far, I have a sense that there's an artist in you. That would like to express yourself more fully. I don't know if that fits for you or not, that just occurred to me. Because I find you kind of expressing yourself and then you kind of hold back like this. And I wonder if that's how you feel sometimes while at school. 

01:08:10
BRIDGETTE I think that's how I feel a lot. 

01:08:10
THERAPIST A lot. And even at home when you're parents make homophobic remarks. 

01:08:15
BRIDGETTE Yeah. I want to speak up and say something but it's always discouraged. 

01:08:20
THERAPIST Yeah. I wonder if you could picture taking a risk with somebody that you trust even a little bit, to let them know just a little bit more about what it is you would like to have them know about you. It doesn't necessarily mean your sexual orientation, it could be something else. Can you imagine just taking a little bit of a risk. 

01:08:45
BRIDGETTE I, I don't know. I mean what, I don't know what I would say. 

01:08:55
THERAPIST Mmm. Okay. Um, what I'm referring to is that you've told me that that there are times when you feel like you hold yourself in. And I'm wondering if you can imagine a situation where you might say something you would feel comfortable risking saying. 

01:09:15
BRIDGETTE Like, like telling someone that I've been feeling really sad, lately? 

01:09:20
THERAPIST Yeah. How would that be to do that? 

01:09:25
BRIDGETTE I don't know, I guess it be kind of scary, I don't. 

01:09:30
THERAPIST Mmm. 

01:09:30
BRIDGETTE I don't know what they might say. 

01:09:35
THERAPIST How do you experience this scariness? 

01:09:40
BRIDGETTE I guess it's kind of, it's like, I don't know. I'm terrified that they'll not want to hang out with me. 

01:09:50
THERAPIST Okay. 

01:09:50
BRIDGETTE So, I experience it as a fear of rejection. 

01:09:50
THERAPIST Okay. And so when that happens you want to pull back. And you want to be just kind of the way they think you need to be. No wonder you feel the aloneness, and the anger, and the frustration. Can you imagine or how can you imagine yourself being a little more full of yourself because that's one way we might be working toward here. Can you give me a picture of something like that. 

01:10:20
BRIDGETTE I guess, I'd be able to talk to my parents. 

01:10:25
THERAPIST Mmm. 

01:10:25
BRIDGETTE Um, not feel like I have to watch every word I say, or. 

01:10:30
THERAPIST Mmm. 

01:10:30
BRIDGETTE Um, you know be more open with my friends. 

01:10:35
THERAPIST Yeah. What would that be like for you? 

01:10:45
BRIDGETTE It be nice. 

01:10:45
THERAPIST Yeah. You wouldn't have to be on guard. What would you, just imagine, what would you like to be able to say to either your mom or your dad, just pretend. 

01:11:00
BRIDGETTE I guess, I just want to ask them to, just to like me. 

01:11:05
THERAPIST Yeah. What if they say, well of course, you know we love you. What might you want to say back? 

01:11:20
BRIDGETTE At this point I don't, I don't know if I believe that. 

01:11:20
THERAPIST You don't know that you believe it. It's a little sad for me to hear that and yet I feel appreciative of you knowing that you don't really feel that, that they do love you. Which probably makes it even more alone for you. You feel yourself more alone, more isolated, you know. That is a load I talked about earlier, that's a load you're carrying. You are carrying a load and yet at the same time you are able to name experiences that you are having that I think are very important. Those are the kind of things that we would work on because I see those awareness that you have as strengths that you have. Even in the midst of your feeling alone, right now. And the way that I would be working with you if we would continue to work is that we would be having conversations like this. We would be talking about feelings, thoughts , sensations in your body, and I would be real interested in helping you have experiences not only of how you're feeling now, because you've had a lot of practice of how you're feeling now, kind of like this. I would be working with you to help you have experiences of feeling the way you want to be, more open. More free. 

01:13:00
BRIDGETTE Sounds good. 

01:13:05
THERAPIST Sounds good. Yeah. I would very enjoy working with you if that's something you would like to continue to do. And I appreciate your sharing with me today. Again, I want to come back to the image of the artist. This may sound a little far fetched to you, I don't know. But just even now in your face, there's a little bit of light there that is lovely to see. And that's the kind of light and that's the kind of expressiveness that I think we could journey together to help you uh, do more of that. And so, if you want to think about that and let me know, then I'd be very happy to work with you. 

01:13:50
BRIDGETTE Okay. 

01:13:50
THERAPIST Okay. 

01:13:50
BRIDGETTE Thank you. 

01:13:50
THERAPIST Thank you.

01:14:40
THERAPIST Hello, Bridgette, what brings you in today. 

01:14:40
BRIDGETTE I guess, I'm just hear to talk to somebody. Um, I don't really feel like I've had anybody to talk to and I've just been feeling really down lately. And I want to talk to somebody. 

01:14:55
THERAPIST Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling? You said you were feeling down. 

01:15:00
BRIDGETTE Yeah, just um, I've been feeling really tired lately and I just haven't, I haven't been feeling good. I just feel like I don't really have any friends at school. And I've been really tired and skipping classes and just haven't really liked myself. 

01:15:20
THERAPIST Yeah. Not really feeling motivated to do much, yeah. So can you tell me a little bit about, you said, um, not being connected to your friends. Tell me more about that. 

01:15:30
BRIDGETTE I guess a lot of the kids at school, I don't know, I just feel like they've been making homophobic remarks a lot. 

01:15:45
THERAPIST Ah. 

01:15:45
BRIDGETTE And I get really upset about it. And one of my friends in particular, she's like calm down. You're getting angry for no reason. And I don't know it's upsetting. I, I don't know why I'm getting angry and I try not to but I can't. 

01:16:05
THERAPIST Yeah. But you're really angry. I mean, the, the response that you have to the homophobic remarks is that it is angering. Yeah, why are some of the remarks that you hear and how are they, are they directed at you, are they directed, do you hear that um, toward other people. Tell me more about those. 

01:16:25
BRIDGETTE I hear it a lot in the halls. 

01:16:25
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

01:16:25
BRIDGETTE I hear it a lot in, you know, quit acting like a fag and that's so gay. 

01:16:30
THERAPIST Huh. 

01:16:30
BRIDGETTE Um, I've had several girls say, you know, why you acting so gay, do you have a crush on me and but. 

01:16:40
THERAPIST Ah. Yeah, and, and then when those remarks are said is anyone saying anything to object to them. Um, other than you and how you feel or does anyone speak up? Like teachers or maybe people, peers, or. No. So, you're on the receiving end of it with no one really standing up. Feeling pretty attacked it sounds like. 

01:17:05
BRIDGETTE Well, I guess I just, yeah. I get angry. 

01:17:10
THERAPIST Yeah. 

01:17:10
BRIDGETTE And I don't, I don't know what to say about it. I don't want anybody to know. 

01:17:15
THERAPIST Well, it sounds like it's completely upsetting. And it doesn't sound like your being validated for, or even supported for how you naturally feel to homophobic remarks. Um, how do you identify in terms of your sexual orientation? 

01:17:30
BRIDGETTE Um, I guess I consider myself a lesbian. 

01:17:35
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. Hmm. It's important for me to understand how you see yourself. Not so much the label of what people put on you put how you, how you experience homophobic remarks in terms of how you ident- your identity. 

01:17:50
BRIDGETTE Yeah. 

01:17:50
THERAPIST So, to whom are you out to, who knows that you identify as lesbian? 

01:18:00
BRIDGETTE Nobody. 

01:18:00
THERAPIST Ah, and that must feel pretty isolating. You must feel pretty alone. Yeah. 

01:18:10
BRIDGETTE I do. Mm-hmm. 

01:18:10
THERAPIST Yeah. Can you tell me more about the support, the uh, the support from your family. 

01:18:20
BRIDGETTE Um, there is none. I couldn't even mention it to my parents, they would freak out. 

01:18:30
THERAPIST Wow. Can you say more about how they would freak out. 

01:18:35
BRIDGETTE They're just really religious and they make remarks about being gay all the time and how disgusting and repulsive that is. Yeah. 

01:18:45
THERAPIST Yeah. So you've learned, you've learned that being gay or being lesbian is repulsive and bad, that's what you've learned about that. And how is that for you? 

01:19:00
BRIDGETTE It sucks. 

01:19:00
THERAPIST Yeah. 

01:19:00
BRIDGETTE I, I don't know, I just feel, I feel ashamed of myself. Like I wish, I wish I could be different. I wish I could be, you know, what they want me to me. 

01:19:15
THERAPIST Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I sounds like when you talk about your experiences at school even at home that there's some many lows to the different context that you have to you're under, saying who you are is exactly who you are is great. And it's where you need to me, even with the feelings that you have. There's no one um, from the outside or saying that's okay. It's okay to feel that way and it's natural to feel angry when people say hateful things, like you hear at school. Yeah. So, it also sounds like some other belief systems or the belief that you have about being a lesbian that you've learned is that it's not okay. So it's even deeper than that too. There's multiple layers to that. 

01:20:05
BRIDGETTE Yeah, there's, I don't know anybody that, you know, has said anything positive about being gay. And it, I don't know, I just, I know that the girls that, you know, they're, they're heterosexual and I want to hang out with them and, and I just wish that I wasn't so angry. 

01:20:25
THERAPIST Mmm. 

01:20:25
BRIDGETTE And sometimes I wish I didn't feel like this. 

01:20:25
THERAPIST Mmm, and wishing that you don't feel like this because, because why. 

01:20:30
BRIDGETTE Because, because I'm gay. 

01:20:35
THERAPIST Yeah. It sounds like also wishing that you don't have this feelings as saying, I, I need to change how I feel naturally um, to the hurtful environment and to the lack of acceptance of who you are. So then it feels like then I, Bridgette have to change in how I feel about myself. 

01:21:00
BRIDGETTE Yes. 

01:21:00
THERAPIST Yeah, that gets tiring, I would imagine. 

01:21:00
BRIDGETTE It does, I, I don't even want to be at school. I leave most days right after third period and I don't come back. Just maybe go to the mall. 

01:21:15
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

01:21:15
BRIDGETTE Or go home. It's I don't know. 

01:21:20
THERAPIST Yeah. Well when I hear you talk about what you're experiencing, I think I'd feel the same way, in terms of not wanting to be there and wanting to escape somewhere else. So, I'm wondering when, when you do go to the mall and you don't go to classes what feels good about that. What, what are you um, you didn't use these words but I did, seeking for a safe heaven or seeking somewhere that feels um, more comfortable. What is that for you. 

01:21:45
BRIDGETTE It's, I just don't have to deal with anybody and I, huh, I just feel like I don't have to answer anyone. I can just, you know, sit and shut all the voice off and kind of be by myself. 

01:22:00
THERAPIST Yeah. Because that's the safest place to be right now. Right. So, I know you mentioned that when you first, when we first sat down that it's effecting your school work, it's effecting your motivation. Um, and that when you talk about your experiences is a connection in how you're doing in school and how you've been feeling the connection to what you've been experiencing with your friends and the beliefs about being a lesbian from your family. Does that, does the connection fit for you in terms of how you've been feeling inside? 

01:22:35
BRIDGETTE Yeah. I just, I don't know I feel like I'm not, like I'm worthless and what's the point of me even being there. 

01:22:45
THERAPIST Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:22:45
BRIDGETTE Uh, uh, I don't know if I don't have, you know, friends and I'm not even going to be liked then why do I need to be here. 

01:22:55
THERAPIST Hmm, thoughts of feeling like I just, why, why live anymore perhaps or is it wanting to disappear or is it sometimes wanting to escape from life. 

01:23:10
BRIDGETTE I just. 

01:23:10
THERAPIST Tell me more about that. 

01:23:10
BRIDGETTE I just want to be different. 

01:23:15
THERAPIST Yeah. 

01:23:15
BRIDGETTE I just, I just want to be like everyone else. And, and I'm not feel like I constantly have to pretend to be something else and I just want to fit in. And I'm tired of feeling like crap all the time. I'm tired of being tired. Like I'm tired of fighting everybody about who I am. 

01:23:35
THERAPIST Yeah. It sounds like a constant fight. Yeah. And it, I also want to check in about in addition to your sexual identity and all of the barriers and all of the um, hurtful things that you've been experiencing at school, are there other parts of you that feel like you can't be yourself, other parts of your identity that you bring with you. Who you are. 

01:24:05
BRIDGETTE I guess, I mean everyone in my school is white and um, one of my really good friends Melanie always makes the comment about, you know, you're acting really ghetto right now, you need to calm down. And it just annoys me or she says, why don't you, you know, get a weave in your hair like those other black girls and stop wearing your hair so kinky all the time. And um, it just, it's frustrating. 

01:24:30
THERAPIST What's the meaning that you take from that? From those kinds of statements. What's the meaning the under-core, the core about those statements? 

01:24:40
BRIDGETTE That I don't look right. 

01:24:45
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. That you need to be different, that you, that you need to change who you are to be, to be what? To be better or to be accepted. 

01:24:55
BRIDGETTE To be better, to be accepted. 

01:24:55
THERAPIST Yeah, yeah. So you're getting pretty direct and pretty direct and indirect messages about who you need to be. Yeah. So it makes sense to me when you say, I want to be, I just want to be different. I don't want to be who I am, in terms of being a lesbian and how you identify ethnically. I didn't ask you that, but how do you identify ethnically? 

01:25:20
BRIDGETTE African-American. 

01:25:20
THERAPIST African-American, so changing who you are in terms of ethnicity and how people experience you. Yeah, yeah. Is there a space where all parts of you feel, even a space that's external to you. Uh, maybe someone or person um, or within yourself where feels that you can fully be all who you are. 

01:25:50
BRIDGETTE Not right now. 

01:25:55
THERAPIST Mm-hmm. 

01:25:55
BRIDGETTE I mean, I try to be alone but it sucks to be alone. I feel like I'm constantly battling it. 

01:26:00
THERAPIST Yeah. That was my guess when I asked the question of how a feeling like there's a place you feel completely all of you where you don't have to dim one part of you. Um, and who the essence of who you are is. comes with part of it. Who you're attracted to and who you are ethnically and racially, you know, just you're being. Those are just some parts of you. But what you just described to me feels like there's not a space um, in the different parts of your life where you can be accepted and celebrated for who you are. How is this feeling to talk about about this with me? 

01:26:40
BRIDGETTE I guess, I feel a little overwhelmed, frustrated. But I'm, I'm glad I can actually say something about how I'm feeling. 

01:26:55
THERAPIST Yeah, yeah. I'm really glad that you feel like you can in our first meeting trust me with a lot of your experiences because it seems like um, in most people in your life when you would bring this up it would um, saying that you're overreacting or what you're feeling is not okay. Or leave at home this part of you, don't be who you are, be something else. Whether it's being white or being straight, heterosexual but the message is that, you know, keep it inside. Uh, so I really, thank you for trusting me with this. What I hope is that as we continue to work together that our foundation is really built on a belief system that I work from in terms of, in terms of therapy. And I, as you talk about your experiences I really believe that what you're feeling and how down you felt and just hopeless and feeling alone is, is a real normal and natural response to very, very unhealthy, hateful. I'd even say hateful um, hateful environment and experiences. It doesn't really sound like anyone is really advocating for you or standing up for you. But that's my assumption. That's what I'm hearing. 

01:28:10
BRIDGETTE Yeah. 

01:28:10
THERAPIST Yeah. Yeah. So I'm wondering how it would feel to continue working with me, um, for another meeting to continue to explore some of your inner experiences and maybe how um, what's getting in the way of you being able to achieve what you want to achieve in school and in life. But really um, having the space to make the connections with what's not your fault and what's not something that you have to change within yourself but understanding how um, how the context that you're in comes from a very heterosexist. And I'd even venture to say, racist environment that favors a real um, people who don't look like you or look like me. That um, understanding that context give a different view on what um, you feel about yourself. Which is, I got to change or I've gotta, I've gotta deal with this and suck it up. But I'm wondering how that fits for you. I know that, that was just a lot that I gave you. 

01:29:30
BRIDGETTE I guess, I guess that makes sense that maybe I need to think about changing how I'm thinking about things because of being in this environment. 

01:29:40
THERAPIST Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Thinking changing the way that you perceive things and experience, um, maybe perceive what's around you is different than changing how you feel. Right. So you've been getting messages in saying, don't be upset, what's wrong with you, or change your hair, or change the way that you talk or this and that's fundamentally different than understanding that exactly how you're feeling is exactly how you should be feeling. Because that's true to you. Um, it's different than saying I understand the context around me and that this isn't fair. That this isn't right. That this is actually unjust. I mean that could be a framework from which we go and hopefully have some empowering ways to move about this. 

01:30:30
BRIDGETTE I like the idea of that. 

01:30:35
THERAPIST Yeah. I, I again, I really appreciate um, how much you've trusted me to share your experiences and to trust that I can hold and not argue over truth in out first meeting, that's a huge courageous risk that you've taken with me. I really look forward to meeting with you again. 

01:30:55
BRIDGETTE Thank you. 

01:30:55

01:33:20
COUNSELOR SAM So, you're telling me that uh, people are making fun of you and saying some pretty mean things. Some other people in your life are you don't feel they're that they're for you either. 

01:33:35
BRIDGETTE Yeah. 

01:33:40
COUNSELOR SAM So, tell me how uh, sad are you. If you were to say uh, on a scale from 1 to 100, and 100 is the most sad you ever felt in your life. And, and one is uh, not really sad at all. 

01:34:00
BRIDGETTE May be like 90. 

01:34:05
COUNSELOR SAM 90. Does 90, sometime 90 means, that's, that's pretty sad. Is that right. 

01:34:20
BRIDGETTE Mmm. 

01:34:20
COUNSELOR SAM Have you uh, ever thought about hurting yourself. 

01:34:30
BRIDGETTE No. 

01:34:30
COUNSELOR SAM No. 

01:34:30
BRIDGETTE I don't, I don't want to hurt myself. I just, I want to be different. I'm, I just want to be liked by my friends. 

01:34:40
COUNSELOR SAM Mm-hmm. 

01:34:40
BRIDGETTE And I want to stop feeling like crap all the time. 

01:34:45
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. Tell me more about that. What else, what, what it look like if you're different. You said that you want to be different. 

01:35:00
BRIDGETTE I wouldn't, I wouldn't be gay. 

01:35:05
COUNSELOR SAM Hmm. 

01:35:05
BRIDGETTE I would be like my friends, heterosexual and liked. 

01:35:15
COUNSELOR SAM So, first of all I want to say, I appreciate you comfortable enough to tell me uh, about your uh, you sexual identity. Okay. Um, and I know that can be very tough. And it seems like you're, uh, people are making fun of you to the extent to which you really want to be different and not gay. 

01:35:50
BRIDGETTE Yeah. And I don't want to feel like this anymore. 

01:35:50
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. 

01:35:50
BRIDGETTE I don't want to feel like I'm different or not liked. 

01:35:55
COUNSELOR SAM Mm-hmm. 

01:35:55
BRIDGETTE Like I don't have a place. 

01:36:00
COUNSELOR SAM You know that can be very tough to not have a place. You know, I wanted to talk a little, if I could just uh, ask for a little bit clarification here. Uh, you're, you're. Tell me if I'm right, okay. You're saying that, if you weren't gay your life would be different and you would have friends. Is that right? 

01:36:30
BRIDGETTE Yes. 

01:36:35
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. Um, how much do you believe that? Like on a scale of 1 to 100; 100 is that you believe it so much that uh, you're willing to go out and, you know, really live that out in your own, and really tire to do something about it. And 1 is you don't really believe it at all. How much do you believe that statement that. 

01:37:00
BRIDGETTE I don't know. I, I think that my life would be better but I don't know that I could change. 

01:37:15
COUNSELOR SAM Uh-huh. You don't know that you could change. Um, I would say, that you can't change who you are even if you really wanted to. What do you think about that? 

01:37:40
BRIDGETTE I agree. 

01:37:40
COUNSELOR SAM You agree. Yeah. And if fact, even if you could then that wouldn't necessarily be the best thing for you. What do you think? 

01:38:05
BRIDGETTE Probably not. 

01:38:05
COUNSELOR SAM Probably not. There's tissue here if you want to use it. 

01:38:10
[sil.] 

01:38:20
COUNSELOR SAM You know um, I know it can be tough to talk about. Um, tell me more about um, if you don't mind, about what, what else is going on in school. Like when they, can you tell me more about who, who's teasing you. 

01:38:40
BRIDGETTE I guess in particular like, um, one of my good friends at school. Like you know, if we're talking about just our friends and I might make a comment about someone being pretty and she'd say, "Uh, Bridgette, you know you're such a fag. Like quit acting so gay." And I get really upset about it and you know I'm, you know, I'm, I try and say you can't say that. And it angers me but. 

01:39:10
COUNSELOR SAM Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:39:15
BRIDGETTE I don't know she just brushes it off. And you know, stop acting so ghetto and calm down. And I don't, I don't know how to stop feeling how I feel. 

01:39:35
COUNSELOR SAM Uh, tell me more about your anger. 

01:39:40
BRIDGETTE They're saying or that she is saying these things about me and it doesn't mean anything but it makes me feel like crap. 

01:39:50
COUNSELOR SAM Mmm. 

01:39:50
BRIDGETTE And I can't change it. 

01:39:55
COUNSELOR SAM So, she's saying things about you and it makes you feel like crap. You also had said it was anger. Is, is that what you mean by. 

01:40:10
BRIDGETTE Yes. 

01:40:10
COUNSELOR SAM Feeling anger. Um, and you're saying that you, you can't change it. Yeah? 

01:40:20
BRIDGETTE Mm-hmm. 

01:40:25
COUNSELOR SAM What if you could change it? 

01:40:25
BRIDGETTE I guess I haven't really thought about it. 

01:40:30
COUNSELOR SAM Mmm, yeah. Let's think about it together. What uh, what, what would uh, what could that look like, you think. 

01:40:45
BRIDGETTE Having, having people to talk to, my friends saying positive things about me. 

01:40:50
COUNSELOR SAM Mm-hmm, yeah. It sounds, it sounds like, like a good call. Um, tell me more. 

01:41:00
BRIDGETTE Maybe uh, just, just being accepted and not having to worrying about people, you know, disliking who I am or finding me being gay as, you know, strange or disgusting. 

01:41:20
COUNSELOR SAM Mm-hmm. Do you have um, friends at school that don't tease you about being gay? 

01:41:35
BRIDGETTE No. 

01:41:35
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. Must be tough. Do you think that uh, a true friend would accept you for who you are or, or, or not accept you and make fun of you. What do you think about that? 

01:41:55
BRIDGETTE I think a true friend would accept me for who I am. 

01:42:00
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. I agree, I do. 

01:42:05
[sil.] 

01:42:05
COUNSELOR SAM Do you think that there's other people in your school that are also gay and perhaps experiencing some of these things that you're going through. 

01:42:20
BRIDGETTE I don't know. The, the only gay people that I know at school, you know, they're also white and. 

01:42:30
COUNSELOR SAM Ah, mm-hmm. 

01:42:35
BRIDGETTE They don't understand what I'm going through being African-American. 

01:42:40
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. 

01:42:40
BRIDGETTE So I don't, I don't even know what they're going through. 

01:42:45
COUNSELOR SAM Right. So the ones that you do, you do know who are gay are uh, are white. Uh, but as far as, you know, there could be other uh, students who are African-American or either uh, uh, from another ethnic um, group who are gay. You don't know for sure. Yeah. I wonder, I would, I would bet that there are students that are because are schools pretty big. 

01:43:20
BRIDGETTE Maybe. 

01:43:25
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. And there right now you've got a lot of kids who are uh, are kind of, kind of bullying you because of who you are. 

01:43:40
BRIDGETTE I guess you could say it like that. 

01:43:45
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. Yeah, because um, a lot of times bullies um, bully others in groups. And they just, they find something, uh, they find people who are different in any way. And sometimes I worked in places where uh, kids are bullied not because they're gay but because they're short. The bullies are just out there and, you know, it's unfortunate that it seems like something needs to, um, it would be great if the school could do something. But right now, uh, it doesn't seem like the school has a lot for you in this area. Right. 

01:44:40
BRIDGETTE No. 

01:44:40
COUNSELOR SAM Uh, I just wanted to summarize and see um, see where we're at. Check, uh, you can let me know if, if, uh, what I'm saying is accurate from your perspective. Um, you're having uh, issues with being bullied because of uh, your sexual orientation. And you're feeling sad but also angry about it. And you are wanting to do something about it in terms of uh, trying to change your situation. However, you're feeling some anxiety uh, because you don't want people to know that you're gay. Um, and you're unsure about how people will react. Does that sound about right? 

01:45:35
BRIDGETTE Yeah. 

01:45:35
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah, okay. Well you know, um, that, that I respect you for um. And I know that, that is a concern. And uh, actually the, from the students that I have worked with here there are uh, a number of students who feel the same way as you do, who are gay. Who are also um, different uh, ethnic groups and uh, who also uh, want to do something about this but don't feel, uh, don't want to come out either, per say. So, it's a somewhat of a co-, common experience. And I just want to let you know, that uh, I'm, I was, I've been thinking about creating this uh, a group and really uh, a group about diversity uh, for students of color to come and to discuss our concerns. And I know that uh, a number of them are gay. Would you be will, willing to maybe join, join that or at least check it out a couple of times. 

01:46:55
BRIDGETTE I could, I could do something like that. 

01:47:00
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. Yeah, so you could come, come by um, once I uh, get that created uh, we can. I'll let you know. And you can see, see if you like it or not, or if you're comfortable. Um, another thing I would uh, really like to do with your permission is I like to go into your classroom and, and observe a little bit just to see how things are going in there. Like, uh, see what the other students are doing and uh, your teacher. What do you think about that? 

01:47:35
BRIDGETTE I guess the only think I'm concerned about is that people might know that you're there to see me. Like are you gonna? 

01:47:45
COUNSELOR SAM No, no. They wouldn't know. I go into a lot of classroom. I would talk to your teacher and just, just let her know that I'm coming in to do a routine check and, and see how the students are going, doing. Uh, so no one would know that I'm here because of you. I wouldn't be looking at you per say. 

01:48:05
BRIDGETTE Okay. 

01:48:05
COUNSELOR SAM Does that sound okay? 

01:48:05
BRIDGETTE That sounds good. 

01:48:05
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. Great. So um, we'll, we will uh, I'll come in to observe, talk to you teacher first. We'll uh, I'll get that group going;01:48:20] and uh, let you know about that, you can come and check it out. Okay. Um, does that, does that seem like uh, does that seem like everything we discussed today or? 

01:48:35
BRIDGETTE Yeah. I guess I hadn't really thought that, you know, my friends were bullies and it would actually nice to have somebody to talk to. 

01:48:45
THERAPIST Yeah, okay. Great, great. Uh, well, if there's uh, not anything else. Uh, you know what, one thing I like to ask students is uh, if there's anything that, that we said in here that uh, concerns you or you would like to ask me about? 

01:49:05
BRIDGETTE No, I'm, I think, I think everything went fine. 

01:49:10
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. 

01:49:10
BRIDGETTE I feel a little bit better. 

01:49:15
COUNSELOR SAM Okay, great. All right, well, I'll talk to you again soon. 

01:49:20
BRIDGETTE Thanks. 

01:49:20
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. 

01:49:25
[sil.] 

01:49:25
In this last counseling session, you observed a school counselor advocate at the microlevel in the session by empowering the client. For example, the counselor gave the client language to identify her experience of bullying and he also explored the idea of connecting her with other students who were experiencing similar issues. 

01:49:25
In this next video segment you will observe the school counselor demonstrate mesolevel advocacy efforts outside of the traditional office setting. 

01:49:25
Mesolevel Advocacy: Example 1: Sam, the counselor, connects with Charisse, a teacher at the same school, to see if he come into her classroom to observe classroom behavior. 

01:49:25
COUNSELOR SAM Hey, Charisse, do you have a moment. 

01:49:25
CHARISSE Hi, Sam. Sure just checking some notes for class. 

01:49:50
COUNSELOR SAM Okay, awesome. Um, I've been working with some students and uh, who are gay and lesbian and they're feeling uh, very upsafe in school in general. So, I'm going around doing uh, classroom observation checks to kind of look into the issue a little bit more. And so. 

01:50:05
CHARISSE That's great. 

01:50:05
COUNSELOR SAM Um, I was wondering do you think I can go into your classroom? 

01:50:05
CHARISSE I would welcome it. We haven't had anyone from counseling in a long time and I have observed some of the same issues. 

01:50:15
COUNSELOR SAM Oh yeah. 

01:50:15
CHARISSE In my own classes. So, some hate language. 

01:50:15
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah, yeah. 

01:50:15
CHARISSE That students are using. 

01:50:15
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. 

01:50:15
CHARISSE That I'm very uncomfortable with and really not equipped to handle myself. So I'd be happy to have you come in or anyone from the counseling department. 

01:50:25
COUNSELOR SAM Okay, great. So I'll definitely do that. Uh, you mentioned that you're feeling unequipped to address that. Do you think other teachers would also be needing that support? 

01:50:35
CHARISSE You know, teachers talk and those are some of the things that we talk about in the faculty lounge. 

01:50:40
COUNSELOR SAM Uh-huh. 

01:50:40
CHARISSE Just the discomfort with um, not really knowing what to say and not wanting to make students feel further alienated. 

01:50:50
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. 

01:50:50
CHARISSE So we would welcome support in that are. 

01:50:50
COUNSELOR SAM Great. So what I would like to do is after I've observed them and observed other classrooms uh, I'm going to look into seeing how we can get the whole staff trained at the school. What do you think about that? 

01:51:05
CHARISSE I think that's a terrific idea. 

01:51:05
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. 

01:51:05
CHARISSE Really, our goal is to support all of the students. So, I see all of our kids benefiting from. 

01:51:10
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. 

01:51:10
CHARISSE That type of training. 

01:51:15
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah, I do too, Okay, great. Thanks. 

01:51:15
CHARISSE Okay. 

01:51:20
[sil.] 

01:51:20
Process Questions: 1. What are the benefits to the counselor's advocacy efforts at the mesolevel? 2. What challenges might the counselor experience at the mesolevel? 

01:51:20
Mesolevel Advocacy: Example 2: Sam makes an appointment at Seattle Counseling Service to talk with the director about school staff training. 

01:51:20
COUNSELING STAFF Well, Sam I'd like to welcome you to Seattle Counseling Serivce. 

01:51:20
COUNSELOR SAM Thanks. 

01:51:20
COUNSELING STAFF It's such a pleasure to talk to you earlier today. I'm glad we're able to meet right now. So, hopefully um, we can resolve some of the issues you brought up. 

01:51:45
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah, I'm really uh, really concerned my school uh, a lot of the glbtq students are really feeling unsafe. Uh, I've talked to some teachers already, the prinicipal, um, talked, I've done some observations. I did a survey. Um, and uh, it's really problematic. It's more than uh, just one classroom or one teacher or one group of kids. It's really the whole school. And feeling kind of overwhelmed because I've got a lot on my plate already. I'd like to come to you guys because you guys are the, you know the experts uh, in this area, you are uh, the oldest center specializing with this population in the country, so. Um, I'm wondering if you could help me with that. 

01:52:30
COUNSELING STAFF Definitely want to challenges as uh, the glbt communities been represented more and more in the media. Whether it's on TV shows or negative through uh, politicians or religious organizations uh, that also puts information to young minds and they don't always uh, deliver very well. And I definitely know that a lot of the slang and derrogatory remarks uh, are very hurtful to various minorities including the sexual minority community. And I imagine that's what some of your students are reporting. 

01:53:05
COUNSELOR SAM Yes, yeah. So the students are saying uh, that, and I've witnessed it myself. In fact, some teachers are telling that people are saying, oh you're gay. You know, and uh, I just, hurtful things like that. 

01:53:15
COUNSELING STAFF Yeah, or that's so gay, that kind of thing. 

01:53:20
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah, exactly. 

01:53:20
COUNSELING STAFF Use of that kind of terminology. Which for some is very hurtful because it makes them second guess themselves and or how they appear or how they come across. The other side of course, a lot of young people act out because they're worried people are going to realize they're guy so they try to deliver such that they're extremely macho or extremely femimine that they would not ever be identified with that way. The other one is the one they're probably struggling the most with their own personal identity. 

01:53:40
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah, yeah. So, my principal and everyone's on board in terms of getting some uh, staff training. 

01:53:45
COUNSELING STAFF You bet. 

01:53:45
COUNSELOR SAM Do you, do you guys do that? 

01:53:50
COUNSELING STAFF Absolutely. We always start with the staff first because uh, it's the teachers in the classroom, it's the teachers in the hall ways. The cooks and the janitors all those individuals are the ones that can really help monitor uh, the young people and the communication. And really the first one's to step in, it's much more powerful that a teacher steps in to correct another, a young individual. Versus a young individual having to stand up for themselves or their friends. 

01:54:15
COUNSELOR SAM Mmm. 

01:54:15
COUNSELING STAFF So I would definitely recommend that we would start but uh, with, with a, adults in the building. 

01:54:20
COUNSELOR SAM Sure. 

01:54:20
COUNSELING STAFF And not just the teachers but all the different people who are in the building throughout the day. 

01:54:25
COUNSELOR SAM Great, great. So, uh, you know, when, what, what do we need to do in terms of getting this set up. 

01:54:35
COUNSELING STAFF Well, the first and foremost is I do believe that, it sounds like if you're taking the lead on it that it's really critical that you make sure you have the people with the most power, would be the principal and the vice principal are on board as well. Because one the things that is going to happen is some teachers, some janitors, uh, the chefs, the cooks are going to be very uncomfortable or resistant. And so it really needs to be, come from the top down and says, this is important. It's, it's a vital and it's going to be part of our culture in our, in our school. And so you need the buy in from the people at the top. 

01:55:10
COUNSELOR SAM Right, right. 

01:55:10
COUNSELING STAFF And so, if you like, I can definitely, may be you and I can set up a meeting and meet with, I don't know how many principals you have or vice principals you have. We can start and actually have a meeting and are going over what are identified issues and then uh, what is the time that they have available that we can come in and do uh, a presentation to the teachers. 

01:55:25
COUNSELOR SAM Well uh, great. Yeah, no uh, I, I can set that up and we can work together on that. Uh, and that sounds great. Thanks a lot. 

01:55:35
COUNSELING STAFF You bet and then from uh, once we do that of course, what we'd like to do is that go out and do a presentation for the students. uh, my self and colleagues we would be the ones that come in and do that. 

01:55:50
COUNSELOR SAM Oh, okay. 

01:55:50
COUNSELING STAFF But we would want to uh, identify the, the teachers, the principals as all being a team together. And together we say no to derarogatory homophobic remarks just like we would to uh, a remarks of racism and such. 

01:56:05
COUNSELOR SAM Sure, sure. 

01:56:05
COUNSELING STAFF And start with that. 

01:56:05
COUNSELOR SAM Okay. 

01:56:05
COUNSELING STAFF Then but the other thing that you can do, it's sounds like you're kind of the leader there, is make sure you are identified in your school as being a safe person, that anybody and everybody can come to. 

01:56:20
COUNSELOR SAM Yeah. 

01:56:20
COUNSELING STAFF And even though you perceive yourself and you believe others see you that way. One of the things that young students will look for are signs that you are the cool one they can come to. And that would be um, the, the pink triangle for instance that you would have it displayed in your office, may be the rainbow flag like this one here. 

01:56:35
COUNSELOR SAM Oh, oh. 

01:56:40
COUNSELING STAFF To any of those kind of symbols are, are just off to the side, people would notice it. They understand what it means they notice it. And it just, it says without uttering a word that boy this person is a safe person to go to. 

01:56:50
COUNSELOR SAM No, yeah. I think that's a great idea. I actually have a triangle but I actually didn't put it up yet. 

01:56:55
COUNSELING STAFF Oh. Yeah, yeah I definitely encourage you. 

01:57:00
COUNSELOR SAM That's my fault and I need to do that. 

01:57:00
COUNSELING STAFF But no, it's a great start. The other thing is a few books. We uh, you'd be amazed how many people scan bookshelves. There's a few books that uh, address the glbt community, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender community. That can really open up doors for individuals coming in say, wow if he's reading about it he's probably cooler than I thought he was. 

01:57:20
COUNSELOR SAM Huh, no okay. Yeah, it makes total sense. So if you can give me some. I won't, I won't I wonder if you can give me some references I can. 

01:57:25
COUNSELING STAFF Absolutely. We'll actually, we have uh, books that we'll donate to you. 

01:57:30
COUNSELOR SAM Oh, oh. 

01:57:30
COUNSELING STAFF And to your school. 

01:57:30
COUNSELOR SAM That is awesome. 

01:57:30
COUNSELING STAFF And then of course, we'll always be there to provide follow-up because if we can help the young individuals uh, turn the uh, uh, those who are uh, not part of the community into allies then we all grow from it. 

01:57:45
COUNSELOR SAM All right. Okay. I'm, I'm ready to sign up then. 

01:57:50
[sil.] 

01:57:50
Social Justice Model Discussion: 1. What did you like/dislike about the therapist work with the client? 2. How effective/ineffective was the therapist in the session? 3. What strengths/limitations did you observe in the session? 4. What observations did you make about the client-counselor relationship? 5. What recommendations do you have for improvement? 

01:57:50
Conclusion 

01:58:25
DR. MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, we've had chance to watch four separate counseling sessions with the same client. Uh, each counselor brought their uh, very best in terms of their work with uh, the client, Bridgette. Each therapist I think is fair to say that each of them were very well intentioned and had uh, the client's best interest in mind. I think it's also fair to say that are uh, reflection as we reflect on each of the four different counseling sessions is that uh, Bridgette, actually felt connected with every single therapist she worked with. Each of them again worked from a different um, and operated from a different paradigm. Um, unfortunately being well intentioned doesn't always cut it. Uh, um, because the, the impact is really drastic for, for clients and this particular case Bridgette. So what I'm going to do right now, is I'm going to talk about each of those four sessions and identify what I felt were some of the really great things the therapist was doing in session with Bridgette and also identify some things that really I think were barriers of their ability, not only to connect with Bridgette but also barriers to her own well-being. Which I think is really important to point out with each of these particular models that we're able, to, to uh, watch. The first model I want to talk about is, the medical model. And in this particular model one of the things, the therapist did a lot of really great things. I think one of the things she did really well was very warm, very empathic, uh, very geninuine and authentic in her work with Bridgette. Uh, I think that allowed Bridgette to really connect with her and open up. And share some of the things that were difficult to share. Um, I like that fact that she uh, checked for suicide. I thought that was really important. Especially with a client who presents with symptoms of depression. You know, I thought she did a real good job on that. Uh, I also thought that she did a great job exploring the physica l symptoms that uh, she was displaying. She was checking on her eating habits, her diet. She checked to see if she was getting enough sleep. Uh, she looked at her behaviors uh, and explored that a little bit to see if they were healthy or unhealthy. And really went deep into that which I thought was, was uh, uh, very good uh, uh, on her part. I think in terms of areas of growth or one of the limitations, if you will, with operating from the medical paradigm, medical model paradigm, and you saw this with these particular videos, the focus was soley on uh, her physical symptoms that she was presenting in session. I think that was limiting because she really didn't get a chance to really explore how her social context might have uh, a factor and influence in terms of some of her presenting problems. Um, I think the other limitation was I think that uh, uh, suggesting medication was a little too soon in this particular session. Especially for a first session. Where she uh, the therapist only had uh, 15, 20 minutes to really explore the issue, you know. And I think that's really soon because medication has, can really have a big impact on people's uh, uh, body as well as psychologically. And so I think that was uh, uh, limitation in terms of her work with this particular client, you know. I think the other thing was that she didn't really acknowledge Bridgette's uh, identity. Even though Bridgette had shared that with her in this particular session. Uh, in terms of her lesbian identity, in terms of her ethnicity and how that was impacting her ability to really do well in school and miss school a lot of times and stuff. And so, there wasn't acknowledgement of that uh, aspect of her identity which, you know, I think if there was some discussion about that, that could of led to some rich, rich dialogue about how identity influences her, her experience in the world. In this particular case in school and at home. The therapist also really operated from an expert model. And in the sense the therapist knew what was best for the particular client. I think which is also problematic, uh, especially when you're working with youth. In this particular case a high school student, you know. What we say in session has a lot of impact so we want to be really careful with the role that we play uh, uh, and what we say with clients in sessions. Especially with youth because they're more susseble, susseptable to be, to being influenced by adults. Uh, because of the power that we have, the title that we have as, as counselors, and the degree that we have. Uh, and Ithink it was also pretty clear in terms in this particular session that the therapist really operated from a deficit model. In a sense that it was the client that really needed to change and one of the ways to help her change and get back on track was through medication versus looking at her environment, and exploring how her environment might influence of her mental health and well-being, and ability to really go to school and really function well in school. Uh, and so the therapist, even though she was very well intentioned and even though she had the best interest of the client in mind, you know, really did some harm with this particular client. I think in terms of making her feel like it's her fault that she's feeling this way, and that perhaps medication might be uh, the solution to her problems. Which in the short-term she might walk away feeling really good but it doesn't change the overall picture of the school environment, of her home environment. So she still has to deal with the realities of her world which weren't really addressed in this particular session. And so that's some of the limitations of the medical model and some of the drastic impact it can have I think. Uh, and as we saw in our session, in the session today. The second session I wanted to uh, process with you was the intrapsychic model. Um, in similar to the first therapist, I think the counselor did a really good job of being warm and empathic, and genuine. Uh, and you could really see him, really being ragerring in a sense in terms of really accepting Bridgette for who she was and really caring for her. And really operating from a place of care. He had her best interest in mind uh, and wanted her to know that as well. And I think she really felt that uh, because he was so warm and authentic with her. He was very well intentioned with her in, in his work with her which I thought that was a strength in his ability to really connect with her. Um, the other thing I thought he did really well was he helped her understand her inner world. A lot of the work he did with her in session was focusing on her thoughts, her feelings, and her behaviors, and really how she was experiencing that uh, for herself. And, and acknowledging that and also she was aware of some of the internal things that was going on with her. So I thought he did a really beautiful job of helping gain insight really to her inner world and the inner workings of her thoughts and her feelings and how that's connected to some of the things that she's doing in session. Um, I also think that Bridgette was able to walk away uh, feeling a sense of relief. She was able to really uh, uh, emote really in his session, her session with him. Um, his use of the empty chair technique was a beautiful demonstration of a Gasphalt empty chair about getting her to work through some of the unfinished business she had uh, with some of the people in her life. It was really cathartic for her, if you will. Uh, uh, for her to be able to share some of her inner most deepest thoughts. Uh, so I think that was really rich and valuable. And I'd gather to say most people who are watching uh, the therapist working with Bridgette using the, coming from the intrapsychic framework would walk away saying I want to be like that therapist. He was very warm and genuine. You could see his experience coming through. You could see his care coming through. Uh, I thought he did very beautiful job of working with her and I think for the most part people would as well. In terms of the limitations though, you know, Sue, Sue talked about this in her book, Counseling the Culturally Diverse, and that, is that he was really culturally encapsulated. Uh, he was really operating from a framework that really didn't take culture, the social context in mind. And I think that was really the limiting his ability to really understand what was going on with her, you know. Even though, Bridgette the client shared a little bit about her identity and sort of her environment at school and whether or not her parents were accepting or not of her. He didn't really touch on those external environment variables and help her connect it with some of the things that are going on with her internally. Um, and sometimes when we don't do that sometimes when we're not intentional about helping clients make connections between their internal world and their external world they can often walk away feeling that there's something wrong with them. As oppose to perhaps it's their environment that may be chaotic and that their reaction to a chaotic environment is actually normal. I think it's fair to say that Bridgette walked away thinking there's something wrong with me. This therapist is great because I connect with him, he's helping me really feel uh, excited about working with him because I'm feeling better. Uh, and, while that may be true I think the long term changes that Bridgette is actually seeking uh, will be short lived. She may feel better in that moment or better after session but the reality is she has to continue to go to that school. Uh, or if she transfers to another school she'll probably going to feel uh, similar uh, uh, feelings the environment not being safe for her because of her ethnic identity or it not being safe because of her sexual identity as a lesbian female. Uh, and it's her environment at home is still the same. Things haven't necessarily changed. So, while she may understand the inner workings of her experience and her mind better uh, she, her environment is still the same, it hasn't been altered. And so, I thought that was a very real limitation in terms of her ability to really experience long-term psychological health and well-being. I think the other limitation that's really important to point out is that while the therapist was very genuine, authentic and had the client's best interest in mind, he's also very value neutral. Uh, he didn't really share much about what his perspective on what was going on with her. He didn't really talk about uh, some of the political issues that deal, that are related to the gay and lesbian experience, the lgbtq experience in schools as well as in the environment. You know, I think that's limiting because what she's talking about is very value laden. She's talking about people who hold certain values and beliefs about certain groups of people, in this case lgbtq individuals, in this case African-American individuals. Uh, and he didn't really shed light into how uh, racism and heterosexism, and homophobia are really influencing some of the internal uh, disconnect that she's having, the internal tension that she's experiencing, and probably because of his belief that therapist that therapist should be value neutral. That we should step back and try to uh, uh, understand, help clients gain insight and understand their world. But we shouldn't intervene in their world uh, because it's really the client's responsibility to intervene. And so I think that was very limiting in that sense in being really value neutral. Which is interesting enough also a value laden decision. Uh, the notion of I'm not gonna put myself into this session. I'm not gonna speak out is actually a value laden decision cloaked under it being or tried to be neutral. Uh, something to sort of think about as we think about some of the strengths uh, of the intrapsychic model as well as some of the limitations, and the very real limitations it has on Bridgette's ability to experience optimal health and well-being. The third model that I wanted to process with you is the multicultural bio-psycho-social model of counseling. I thought there were a lot of strengths. The therapist was very warm, geniune, and authentic. Uh, and really her self, in this session which I think was important because it allowed Bridgette, the client to connect with her a lot. I thought she did a beautiful job of really acknowledging some of the tension and the fear and anxieties Bridgette was experiencing as it was related to her identity. So she did a really good job of, really using basic attending skills; summarizing, paraphrasing, so on and so forth. That the other therapist also did in their session with Bridgette. Uh, one of the things that I think she did a really great job of was being able to connect some of the issues that Bridgette was presenting with sort of the social, cultural, and economic conditions that are existing in the world. So she viewed Bridgette not just as a human being or as a person in a vacuum but viewed her in context of her environment. Which really allowed Bridgette to sort of expand her understanding of some of the issues that she is presenting. Some of the symptoms of depression, the sadness, the inability to go to class uh, I thought she did a great job helping her and maybe it's not her uh, that has an issue with her identity. But maybe it's her environment and that she is very much is in the know about who she is as a human being. Who she is in terms of her ethnicity. Who she is in terms of her sexuality but it's her environment that can't grapple with the multiple aspects of her identity. In this case her ethnic identity as well as her sexuality. So I thought she did really beautiful job of creating what Paula Ferrar refers to as, critical consciousness. She helped Bridgette understand her situation in context of, in the context of an oppressive environment. Which really got her to really think about who she is in a different way. Which I think is important because what she did at that point was she helped Bridgette externalize what she internalized. Which was her oppression. Uh, which the other counselors weren't really able to do. They're working with symptoms of internalize oppression but not looking at how she can externalize it by connecting it with her environment, at school and at home. So I thought she did a very beautiful job above, of doing that. Of balancing her inner world with her outer world. Which is really what multicultural counseling is about. Is looking at clients from a larger cultural context. I also thought she did a very good job as did the uh, counselor in the intrapsychic uh, uh, video example of acknowledging risk of coming out to her and some of the strength that it takes to come out to somebody that she doesn't even know. So I thought she did very beautiful job of doing that. Um, I think one of the limitations, and this is a very real limitation of the multicultural approach and I shared this in the lecture is that, that's where it stops. She helped Bridgette understand herself in context and had discussed the idea of perhaps exploring even deeper how identity shapes her world view. How that shapes her experiences in the world, but that's where it stops. She didn't really focus on systems interventions, the need to uh, uh, go to the classroom or the need to connect with the school, the need to work at the macrolevel, the political level to alter her environment, uh, to alter the system in which she works, lives in. Uh, and I think not being able to do that is limiting. And because her environment remains the same, while Bridgette may have a better understanding of herself as an ethnic being uh, through her work with this particular counselor. While she may have a better understanding of herself in terms of her sexual identity in relation to a homophobic environment the environment still remains the same. Uh, and so, that critical consciousness that she has on one hand is powerful because it can really help her understand her world in a more comprehensive way and it really helps to externalize her world but the environment is still the same. Uh, she's still not able, not equipped with skills to navigate around that environment. Uh, that's uh, uh, limiting in of itself. So, while there were strengths in this particular session there also glaring limitations that uh, really, you know, limited the client's ability to experience uh, optimal health and well-being in her, her life; which she seeks. The fourth session I want to talk about is the social justice model, the bio-social-advocacy mode of counseling. Also referred as the fifth force in the counseling profession. I'm going to talk about the strengths and limitations of this particular model. For the strengths I'm going to look at it from a micro. meso, and macrolevel perspective. Again at the microlevel, the microlevel uh, form of advocacy really has to do with the work that we do with clients in session. Some of the other counselors I thought, was very warm, accepting, and acknowledging of some of the realities that Bridgette, the client was presenting. And some of the fears she had around with, related to her identity. Uh, I thought he did a beautiful job acknowledging the risk it took to come out. Uh, especially when she wasn't very comfortable. So I thought that was very well done. As, similiar to how therapist from intrapsychic model acknowledged her strength in that, as well as the multicultural therapist. Uh, one of the things I thought he really did well with her was he wasn't very neutral with her. He shared a little bit with her about some of his thoughts based on what she as sharing. Uh, for example, one of the things he said was, you can't change who you are, you're born with it, you know. Therapist who operate from an intrapsychic perspective may not necessarily share that with a client. They may hope that a client gets there through insight. They may have that value and belief but because of the belief that they need to be neutral they may not necessarily share that so. I thought that needed to be pointed out in terms of his ability to really be gentle about being nonneutral. Which is okay. And I want to emphasize that, it's okay in session to be ourselves. It's okay in session to share our values and beliefs. Especially when it comes to helping clients really understand their world. Which counter to how we tend to be trained in counselor training programs which is that we shouldn't share what our thoughts and opinions are about what a client is experiencing. Even though, they may be asking or inquiring about what our perspective is. And I think it's okay, as long as it's about having the best interest of the client in mind versus our own best interest. Uh, so I think that, he did a very beautiful job of doing that. I liked how he started the session with exploring her inner world. He explored her thoughts, he explored her feelings, some of her behaviors, uh, related to her thoughts and feelings about not going to school. About not feeling comfortable talking about her sexual identity at home. So I thought he did a really good, beautiful job of doing that before he moved into understanding her external world. Uh, I think that's really important uh, for social justice minded individuals to uh, keep in mind. We need to explore and have a really good balance and really have patience around exploring what's going on internally uh, and having a good grasp of that before we explore what's going on externally with a client. I think it's very easy to go to the external and say, oh well it's the environment. Uh, but when we do that too soon we really are limited, limiting ourselves to really understand the picture that the client is trying to paint for us uh, this particular, in session. So I thought he did a really good job of doing that, exploring the inner world before going to explore the external world. I liked how he started talking about whether or not she had a support network at school with friends or even at home. Her, as they were related to some of the issues she was talking about with her respect to her sexual identity. I think that's particular important because she shared and she talked about how she felt lonely and all alone. Uh, and that can really be rich information to, for the therapist in terms of trying to figure out what interventions might be best based on what she's sharing. Um, the other thing I thought he did well similar to the multicultural therapist, he really empowered Bridgette by helping her understand her situation context of really an environment that's not really accepting of her because of her sexual identity and her racial ethnic identity. Uh, he said, and really had her think about, well maybe it's because of bulling was the issue in the school. Uh, uh, versus really her having the problem. I think that caused this really cognitive shift for her and she was able to look at her situation differently. And realize, well maybe I'm being bullied. This is what bullying feels like and looks like. And so, she didn't really have name for her experience beyond that. She felt really uh, uh, bad and using her terms sucks to feel this way. But she didn't have a name for it. And I think just providing a name for her experience that it's bullying was really empowering in of itself. And it helped her connect her situation in context in a different way than the multicultural therapist did. The multicultural therapist uh, looked at her situation in context but really around her identity. And this particular therapist did it by looking at her environment and her identity in relation to her environment which is really important because that leads to the mesolevel intervention that he was able to implement with this particular client. Uh, in terms of how he did that, I thought he did a very beautiful job of understanding her external world and then getting the client's permission to go into the classroom to do some kind of observation to sort of gather more "data" if you will of what's sort of going on in the classroom environment. So he can see for himself uh, as well, as using sort Bridgette's insight about what's going on to develop intervention that would really meet her needs. Uh, in terms of the mesolevel I loved how he stepped out and really had a hallway discussion with the uh, uh, teacher to talk about potentially coming into her classroom to observe sort of her class to see what was going on. I loved how he uh, even though we didn't see it in session had an opportunity to talk with his Principal about some of the bullying that he's noticing students talking about as it relates to being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or even questioning. Uh, I liked how he talked about perhaps doing a guidance lesson in that particular classroom and other classrooms in the school. And I think that's really important because it allows him to really reach out and and, and to address issues of bullying as it relates to sexual identity and other issues of diversity other students not just Bridgette. So he's really advocating on her behalf. Which can really strengthen what he does with her in session, one-on-one. He was able to really focus on how can I alter her environment and the culture of the school. So, focus, focusing on uh, uh, helping students understand their realities of what bullying is all about and how unsafe it is. Uh, when, when, and, and the ramifications of bullying on campus at school. I also liked in terms of the mesolevel advocacy how he talked about potentially doing a staff training with all of the other teachers, administrators as well as counselors in the building. I think that's really important because if we want to really alter the environment in a school setting in this particular case, We need to have adults on board, you know. We can't relay on students alone to address issues of bullying in school. We need also have adults who are onboard and willing to change the culture of the school. Because it's really, it should begin with the adults. They have a real say in terms of what the environment is going to be like in the cafeteria setting, the hallway setting, and in the classroom setting. So I thought that he did a very beautiful job about exploring that potential with her. Uh, in terms of having a potential in-service training. I also liked how he took it one step further in the mesolevel by going to Seattle Counseling Service, which is a counseling agency that serves LGBQ populations in communities of color and those who live in poverty. I loved how he was able to go there and meet the Director of that organization and talk about potentially having them come out and doing the training themselves. I think that's really important because I think when we talk about advocacy and the need for, not just school counselors but counselors to be advocates for social change it can be overwhelming. I thought what he did was a great illustration, an example how it's important to work with other constituents in terms of our advocacy efforts and not focus solely on the fact that we have to do it ourselves. I know for me, if I felt like I had to do everything myself, I'd be really burnt out and overwhelmed with everything I had to do. Especially when we look at the role and function of a school counselor. Uh, school counselors already feel like their plate runeth over, if you will. Uh, so adding one more thing can really be uh, overwhelming. So, I thought he did a beautiful job of using his counseling skills outside of session to, and his resources outside of session to connect with the client or, or on behalf of the client to connect with the agency. Bringing them into to school to provide that staff training that this school really needed to change the culture. So that was uh, a couple of good examples of, of mesolevel forms of advocacy. In terms of the macrolevel, he took it even further by contacting his state legislature about a bill, creating a bill to include sexual orientation and gender identity, and gender expression uh, into the anti-bullying bill that is being considered at the legislative level. So I thought he did a great job by doing that, simply by phone call to State legislaturers and easily by using the internet. Shooting an email to his Legislaturers. I think that's important because we can actually use technology to uh, as a benefit to us. Technology actually makes it easier to advocate on behalf of our clients. So I thought he did a great uh, example of, demonstrating on how to use technology to advocate on behalf of his clients. I think that's important because when talk about macrolevels of advocacy, I think people tend to think about creating social movements, creating rallies. Which is a part of advocacy but just a certain, it's just one aspect of advocacy. Uh, simply by making a simply phone call to your State legislatures and other form of advocacy uh, that's uh, can simply be done in a matter of a couple of minutes. So I thought he did a great example of, of macrolevel form of advocacy by being involved politically. Uh, the political realm without uh, having to expend too much energy uh, in terms what he does everyday as a school counselor. So he did some really great things uh, in his session. In terms of the limitation in his session uh, and I think, not necessarily in this particular session but I think when we talk about the social justice paradigm in how to enact social change and how to operate from a social justice paradigm, I think one of the things people will run up against is this notation of people doing things differently. I think it's going to be very hard for people to think outside of the box. I think, partly because we get trained to focus on working solely one-on-one with clients and not necessarily at the mesolevel or macrolevel, working in the community. I think that's going to be not just the cognizant, cognitive shift for therapist and counselors but also an expodential shift they're really going to have to grapple with. I tell you the first time I started working from an advocacy perspective it was very uncomfortable for me. Partly because I didn't feel equipped uh, to deal with some of the realities my clients were presenting in session. I didn't know how to talk with community leaders. I didn't know how to talk with religious leaders. I didn't know what community agencies were out there. So I felt really uncomfortable, but I made sure I didn't allow my discomfort to stop me from doing what was really in the best interest of my client. So I think when we talk about the limitations of the social justice paradigm, I think part of it has to do with the uncomfortableness of doing things differently. Uh, I think I want to leave you with the notion of, as we think about how can we intergrate social justice into our work with clients. I think we really need to, and I challenge you to each sort of step back and reflect and really assess were you're at. And when you think about what I need to do. I think it begins with starting where you're at and then working from there. Uh, and starting with what you can control. Uh, taking one step at a time. Uh, and looking at whether or not it really fits for you. And I share that because the social justice paradigm isn't a model that really aligns with everybody's values and beliefs. It's very value laden. It has certain belief systems inherit in this model. And it's really about how oppression impacts people's mental health and well-being. And sometimes people may not really uh, aren't able to either see it or really don't think oppression exists. And I think that's something to really acknowledge because folks that come from a social justice paradigm say that it's because we live in an oppressive environment that people come into therapy. Uh, a lot of the problems they're presenting can be connected to larger social inequities in the world. We've had an opportunity to watch four different counseling sessions with one particular client. I've had an opportunity to really share with you what I thought were some of the strengths and limitations of each approach to counseling and psychotherapy. Now, you have a choice to make and that is to do what we've always done in the profession of counseling and psychology which is promote a status quo or we can do things differently. My hope is that you really consider the value of social justice in your work with clients because the ramifications are really drastic for the clients that we work with. It has real negative implications for clients when we don't consider the value of social justice in our work with clients.
