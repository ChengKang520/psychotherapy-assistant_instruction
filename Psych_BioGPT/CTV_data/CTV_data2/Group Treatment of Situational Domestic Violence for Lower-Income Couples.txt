GROUP TREATMENT OFSITUTIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR LOWER-INCOME COUPLES John & Julie Gottman The Gottman Institute The relationship Research Institute 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, good morning. So today we're gonna talk about, ah, the results of a randomized clinical trial that, ah, Julie and I have just, ah, completed, ah, that my research lab has completed and, ah, talking about the treatment of domestic violence and, ah, and we're gonna talk about it particularly for lower income couples because the, the curriculum that we learned up developing and using, uhm, was specially geared for them. And, ah, but you know, we believe it, it would be effective anyway. 

00:00:35
WHAT PERCENT OF WOMEN HAVE EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE? (UNESCO REPORT) • USA 28% • CANADA 29% • EGYPT 25% • JAPAN 59% • KOREA 38% • NEW ZEALAND 20% • SWIRTZERLAND 20% • UK 25% • CHILE 26% • KENYA 42% • MEXICO 30% • NICARAGUA 52% • POLAND 60% • UGANDA 41% • ZIMBABWE 32% 2013 ANAHEIM Domestic Violence a Major Problem Throughout the World • According to a UNICEF survey, the percentage of women ages 15-49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife is: - 90% in Jordan, - 85.4% in Guinea, - 85.4% in Zambia, - 85% in Sierra Leone, - 81.2% in Laos, - 81 in Ethiopia. 

00:00:40
JOHN GOTTMAN So how big a problem is this? And, ah, the United Nations economic and social council, ah, estimates of the amount the domestic violence. And, and these estimates are really, ah, probably a bit too low is that across different countries, ah, we see an enormous amount of domestic violence and some countries as worst and others like Poland and Nicaragua. But, uhm, these estimates really are, ah, a hard to rely on. But we can't conclude that domestic violence is a major problem throughout the world. Uhm, another thing is that according to another study by United Nations, the percentage of women age 15 to 49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife is enormous in many countries. You could see it's in the high 80's. So there's a, there's a real problem here in women's feeling that they have the right to not be beaten. 

00:01:45
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BABIES • According to the Centers for Disease Control, every year in the United States more than 300,000 pregnant women experience some kind of violence involving an intimate partner. • Almost a third of domestic violence cases start during pregnancy. • Women who are already in abusive relationships often report that abuse gets worse when they are pregnant. • Pregnant women who are abused are more likely to experience serious pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, high blood pressure and premature birth. 

00:01:50
JOHN GOTTMAN We also know that domestic violence has an enormous impact on children and, ah, according to the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, every, every year in the United States more than 300,000 pregnant women experience some kind of violence involving an intimate partner. And almost a third of all domestic violence start during pregnancy. Now we know that this is, this is a period, ah, when a baby is on the way, a period high risk even in nonviolent couples. In the first three years of the baby's life, our lab has found that there's a market deterioration of relationship happiness and an increase in hostility judge by videotapes that are code-- coded double-blind. So pre-- pregnant women who are abused physically are more likely to experience, ah, complications with the birth such as miscarriage, high blood pressure and premature of birth. And it's very hard to overestimate the effects of the fetal environment on the development of babies. In fact, in our laboratory we can predict by just looking at the conflict between a couple in the last trimester of pregnancy have they talked to each other during conflict. We can predict with high accuracy not a small correlation how much that baby in three months will laugh, how much that baby will cry. How-- the ability of that baby to self-soothe, ah, and in neurological variable called vagal tone which is the measure of the baby's ability to really calm down and focus attention. So that, uhm, that fetal environment turns out to be very critical. And we used to believe that 50% of intelligence was genetic. And now that the fetal environment has been studied, we now know that only 26% of intelligence is genetic. The rest of that percentage is about the fetal environment. 

00:03:50
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BABIES (CONT.) • Pregnant women who experience domestic violence are also more likely to have a baby who is stillborn. Blows to the tummy, pregnancy complications • Between 2006 and 2008, domestic abuse was reported in 12 per cent of maternal deaths. • In UK one in four babies at high risk of infant abuse due to being born into homes where domestic violence is present. 

00:03:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. So this is-- these are kind of depressing, uhm, facts about domestic violence and, ah, and they go on and on talking about, you know, the effects of, ah, of there are maternal deaths and the effect on, on the babies whose, whose moms experience ab-- abuse. 

00:04:15
RESEARCH FROM OUR LAB: HOW A BABY AFFECTS A RELATIONSHIP • WORK WITH MIDDLE-CLASS COUPLES • Increase in domestic violence • Dramatic increase in hostility between parents (OBSERVED ON VIDEO) • 67% drop in relationship satisfaction of parents • Dramatic increase in symptoms of post-partum depression: 50-70% moms had post-partum depression symptoms • Compromised parenting due to conflict between parents • This conflict transfers to the baby (Alyson Shapiro's work) • Problems in infant emotional development: babies at risk for developing physical health, mental health and behavioral problems • Problems in infant cognitive development: babies of depressed moms show same changes in brain wave patterns as their moms. Later, baby has problems focusing attention in school. 

00:04:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. So in our lab, ah, as I mentioned, you know, we've, we've done this and launch to a neuro search on the transition of parenthood and what was unusual about our research was that we started with, with couples just a couple of months after the wedding, with newlyweds, 130 couples, and followed them as they became pregnant-- as many became pregnant and had babies and had followed the babies as they developed. And one of the things we know, you know, is that there's this big increase in domestic violence, big drop in relationship happiness. Now, the good news is that this-- even though close to 70% of couples who have no psychopathology experiences drop in relationship happiness when a baby is born. Julie and I studied what, what are the differences between the 30% of couples who don't go through this terrible experience with the birth of the baby. What kind of sail through it? How are they different from the co-- 70% who had problems? And based upon that, we developed a workshop, a preventative workshop called bringing baby home which you can find on a website. And we can reverse all of that in two days. So in two days, I'm just taking this workshop where we discovered in a series of research studies and Julie and I wrote book called And Baby Makes Three. And we reported this, this-- ah, the results of this research and 77% of couples who take the workshop don't have that drop in relationship happiness. And we discovered in the subsequent study if there are support groups that follow the workshop then it goes into the high 80's, the effectiveness of that two-day workshop. And not only, ah, is the relationship different, the couple's relationship different, but the baby is different. And the baby didn't take the workshop, you know. Baby was still a fetus, uhm, and the baby's ability to focus attention, to self-soothe, and the baby's neurological and cognitive development really changed. Ah, the baby has learned the language earlier and more complex forms of language as well. So if you don't this, it turns out really that the conflict, ah, between parents, ah, that 70% of couples experience transfers to the baby and the baby is very strongly affected by it. So we learned how to study babies, ah, attract, you know, taught me how to, how to look at mother-in fact interaction. We looked at parent, ah, infant interaction, in general, fathers and, and moms and you can see this transfer and it doesn't happen at all if the, if the parents have taken this two-day workshop. And the workshop last 10 hours so we can do quite a lot and this has been, ah, replicated in Australia and in Iceland. All right, both countries have adopted this approach. 

00:07:05
RESEARCH WITH LOWER-INCOME COUPLES • THE FRAGILE FAMILIES STUDY 16 CITIES: For 82% "unwed mothers," father of baby is romantically involved with the mother at time of baby's birth. • But 85% of these couples have split up by time when baby is 1-year-old, and dads have left. • These couples want to stay together but lack skills to do so. • Desire to work on relationship is strongest when couples are becoming parents. • Over 200 studies show that what keeps fathers in families with babies is minimal conflict and warm and intimate relationship with their babies' mother. High co-morbidities: infidelity, alcohol & drug abuse, violence, prison incarceration. 

00:07:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So then, what Julie and I did was to, was to extend the research for lower income couples. So you know, there's all this writing about how, ah, babies are born to, ah, in the United States, 40% of babies are born to single moms you know, where is the father? You know, father is missing. Well, the Fragile Families Project that was a collaboration between Columbia University and Princeton University. Ah, that study, uhm, these lower income families in 16 different cities in the United States found that for 82% of so-called unwed mothers, there was father there who was romantically involved with the mom. Right. But he couldn't come out of the shadows because she wouldn't get any welfare payments if they knew there was father involved. So there is, the national policy around welfare punishes couple relationships. Sixty percent of the time that dad was live-- living with the mom, right but in the shadows. However, these relationships were fragile, ah, 85% of the couples had split up by the time, ah, the baby was a year old. And you know, what we found in doing pilot work was that these couples really wanna stay together but they don't have the skills to do that. They don't know how manage conflict. They don't know how to meri-- manage intimacy. What-- the overwhelming finding about what keeps dads involve with babies is low conflict with mother and continued intimacy with mother, okay. And so that's-- those two things are likely to really, ah, go away when-- just when a baby arrives. And people-- and poverty have all these comorbidities including infidelity, alcohol, and drug abuse prior incarceration, previous, previous fathers who have father other children that, ah, that the mom has and drug abuse, ah, and so on and domestic violence. 

00:09:10
IMPACT OF FATHERS' ABSENCE • Children likely to be raised in poverty • Children have higher drop-out rates • Children more likely to become teen parents • Children more likely to engage in criminal and risk-taking behavior • Children have difficulty maintaining employment as young adults 

00:09:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So, uhm, we know that really the father is very important. Now, it-- it's not important that the father just be there. He's gotta be involved with the baby. He's gotta be emotionally warm and available. He really has to be there for his kids. So, what do you have to do to get fathers involve with babies? Well, it turns out that you know, none, none of the interventions that have been tried were effective in getting fathers to be interested in babies cuz they all focused on teaching dads how to play with babies, teaching dads how to feed babies, teaching dads about babies. But the real key we thought to having fathers involved with babies both sons and daughters is the relationship with mother, okay. And you know, and here are just some of the impacts of father absence or father presence in a negative way either being emotionally unavailable or being abusive as well. Higher drop-out rates, higher teen pregnancies, the prediction of, ah, the child as the child grows up being engaged in criminal behavior and high risk-taking and unemployment and the list goes on and on. It's quite, quite, ah, quite a big long list. Okay, so how do we put these altogether? 

00:10:30
BIASED LITERATURES EXIST ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (DV) • Michael Johnson: There are two very biased "literatures" on family violence • 1. Family survey research elicits primarily situational domestic violence: Arguments that have gone out of control. Problem here: 40% of families hang up when telephoned in these surveys. We are getting a biased sample. • 2. Women's shelters: Edit primarily characterological batterers. Problem here: No research base for this work. We are getting a biased sample. 

00:10:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Uhm, and how do we take a look at domestic violence which is what we wanna look at. And Michael Johnson is the person that I wanna tell you about because although there's been a lot of typologies of violence, Michael Johnson really I think created the typology that really fits research the best. And what he said is that, uhm, is that there really are two literatures on domestic violence. One, and they're totally different. One is Family Survey Research. People call on the phone and they ask a lot of questions, they are national databases of families. And, and they ask about domestic violence and affairs, and sexuality and all kinds of things like that. Problem is about 40% of the families who are called on the phone hang up, so we get a biased sample there. The second literature comes from women advocates who run women shelters. Now, these people don't do any qualitative research, uhm, but the problem is that the kinds of batterers that really drive women into shelters where their lives are really at stake, they have to get away from that-- are very different kind of, ah, violent person. So the conclusion you know, and that Michael, ah, Johnson came to and really that all of us who have worked in domestic violence research and treatment have come to is this. 

00:11:50
THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: "SITUATIONAL" AND "CHARACTEROLOGICAL" CHARACTEROLOGICAL VIOLENCE • Asymmetrical with cleat perpetrator and victim. • Controlling and dominating behavior, or belligerence. • Perpetrators show little remorse. • Perpetrators attribute blame to victim. • Victim fears perpetrator. • Pit Bulls or Cobras (Gottman & Jacobson) • Cobras exhibit similar behaviors outside the family. • Victim has no control over perpetrator. • Shelter victims mostly fit into this category. • Show films 

00:11:50
JOHN GOTTMAN That there really are two, ah, two types of domestic violence and they have been called various names but, ah, probably the most common one is situational domestic violence versus characterological domestic violence. And we wanna show something about that. Now, characterological domestic violence is very different. There was a very clear victim and a very clear perpetrator in characterological domestic violence, its asymmetrical. Uhm, the victim is not doing anything and Neil Jacobson and I-- the late Neil Jacobson and I studied domestic violence for nine years we had a group of couples who you know, seem to be like the situational domestic violence, it's just arguments that went out of control, right? And, ah, and both people were involved in pushing, shoving, and hitting are-- you know, but they didn't seem to do any, ah, you know, internal organ damage. It didn't seem to really create concussions or broken bones. And we had a groups of, ah, 47 couples like that. And then another group that were characterological and we, we expect in the nine-year longitudinal study that some of the situationally violent couples would graduate to the characterological group and none did, none did. Uhm, so, uhm, what you get out of the characterological violence when you take a look at how they interact in the laboratory with their partner is the-- they're controlling or dominating, or belligerent. So you can see from the nature of the interaction actually whether the-- whether the violence will be characterological or situational cuz the batterers behavior even during this, ah, laboratory situation where they're talking about an area of disagreement is quite different. The perpetrator show little remorse, ah, they attribute blame to the victim. In fact, the way we got these couples, we characterologically violent couples to come in, was that the man were the ones who phone the lab. And they came in, they said, "I wanna show you what this woman is like." You know, and, and the word was really a pejorative word that starts with the letter b. "And she makes me hit her." So the man brought this characterological man really felt blameless and they felt that her words, her nasty words to him w-- justified his violence toward her. And this is very extreme violence. Uhm, uh-hmm, excuse me. We found that there two types of, of, of these characterologically violent guys and we're one of-- calling them Pit Balls or Cobras. And the Cobras were really interesting because first of all they were very charming, and you know, very, very high on skills and antisocial behavior. So these are the sort of, psychopaths are getting involved in relationships. There, ah, very often they're so charming that during a 911 call to the police are-- when the police arrive and the woman who has been beaten is hysterical and really upset, these guys are calm and polite. And the police wind up arresting the woman. They are that good at being charming and you know, playing along with the, you know, with the police. And in fact, in response to the research that, that Neil Jacobson and I did, the, ah, city of Seattle Police Department wind up forming a Cobra detection unit so that they could, they could spot these guys and not arrest the woman, uhm, in a situation like that. So, so these, these men, these are-- these Cobras were very interesting because-- we call them Cobras for a couple of reasons. Paul, Paul Ekman came and looked at some of my tapes and he noticed the rapid head movements of these Cobras. And in fact, when you looked at-- the plain of their face as they talk to their partner, they led with their chin, they were belligerent you know, their behaviors were-- what do you gonna about my taking drugs? Go ahead, do something about it, really-- sort of challenging this, this, ah, category of belligerence was one that came out of this research. Whereas, ah, the other group of, of characterologically violent guys were, ah, we call Pit Balls because they, ah, red with their face, with their forehead and they were domineering rather that belligerent, rather than leading with their chin. And we'll show you some videotape of, ah, you know, a brief clip of the conflict discussion of a Pit Ball and a Cobra. Now the Cobra is very interesting because if you haven't read Adrian Raine's the Anatomy of Violence, please go out and buy this book because it-- ah, Adrian Raine is an amazing researcher. And he put these altogether in this wonderful book that describes the whole field and he-- that-- his lifelong research. Adrian Raine, R-A-I-N-E and it's called the Anatomy of Violence. Well, Cobras look like you know, when they behave in a conflict discussion, it looks like they're gonna burst their artery. You know, they get really upset. And you know, they look really threatening and scary. But when you go back in the control room and look at their physiology, they've actually lowered their heart rate and blood velocity below baseline. This under arousal-- physiological under arousal has been fashioned into a theory that these people really are basically bored with life, and really under stimulated. So very high risk-taking behavior results from their physiological baseline being so low. They reduced their physiological arousal below baseline before they strike, before they become belligerent in interaction. The Pit Balls are the opposite. The gradually increase over the conflict discussion, their heart rate and blood velocity. So these are the guys who blow. So two types of violence, one is just an impuls-- an impulse control problem and the other is a premeditated cool, calm, rational way of manipulating in control like, right. So serial killers are more likely to be Cobras and somebody who has never done anything bad and in Adrian Raine's book he talks about one guy. We never, never, never had a parking ticket even but he threw his wife out the window during an argument. Okay, so that's, that's more likely to be a Pit Ball. The Pit Balls are very jealous, extremely irrationally jealous and have a real problem with, ah, being terrified of being abandoned. Whereas the Cobras have no problem with that. They have a problem with, ah, accepting influence. So what we think is that the victims who go to shelters and the advocates actually are, uhm, primarily the victims of characterological, ah, domestically violent people. So let me, let me show you a little bit of video of these two kinds of perpetrators.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:19:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Ah, okay, great. All right, wonderful. Ah, first of all watch this-- you see the plain of this guy's face? How he's leading with his forehead? Okay, now he's, he's gonna be very domineering. 

00:19:10
DAVID Hold each other on basics philosophy of how to relate to another person as we do. And of course it's gonna escalate, get violent-- we force each other to do that. How do you feel about what I just said? 

00:19:25
PATTY I really, I really feel that he can-- well, there should be certainly a respect here, you know, he can't communicate and just be open to somebody it's not that what suppose... 

00:19:35
DAVID But we know two, this what we did, okay - 

00:19:40
PATTY What are you talking... 

00:19:40
DAVID - and no, you don't have to respect somebody. If you believe in molesting children, I don't respect that. I don't respect your view points. I don't respect the things you say and try to defend, that's my right. Okay? 

00:19:55
PATTY But it's not, it's not like we're, we're talking about each time we're trying to talk, we're not talking about doing major crimes that we've done. We're talking about interpersonal... 

00:20:05
DAVID You mentioned domain-- you mentioned-- your primary domain. 

00:20:10
PATTY It's major that I'm sorry it's-- to compare with something that bad, I mean you know, it's bad but it's not like we should definitely... 

00:20:20
DAVID The, the-- we don't have to get into levels of how bad it is. The point I was making is if you take a certain way that it goes against everything I believe in, that's the point. I don't re-- nobody respect somebody. You don't-- you wouldn't respect me if I believed in, ah, molesting cows. Okay. 

00:20:40
PATTY But it's not, I'm not at it just that I would handle situation differently that you feel and you feel that I'm lying but who's to judge? What I'm saying is why do you judge someone? 

00:20:50
DAVID But this is our last night to say this norms, and we supposedly agreed on that last night but we disagreed. Okay, you talked about how-- first you always start it off, "Oh, David(ph) you yelled at me, and that's why I did this." And I go, "No, I didn't yelled at you. We started of-- I started of coming like I always do and you know..." And then, and then you'll go, "Okay, yes that's the way it was." And I, I feel that I can't-- there's no reality with you. You changed things along you say, "This is true, this is true, wrong that's not true. This is a..." Also you can - 

00:21:25
PATTY No. 

00:21:25
DAVID - defend yourself. 

00:21:25
PATTY No, I'm trying to defend myself David(ph) I just... 

00:21:30
DAVID Then what are you doing? 

00:21:30
PATTY I, I'm just not-- trying to do right now, just trying to say that every person is different - 

00:21:35
DAVID Right I agree. 

00:21:35
PATTY - to be-- even marriage just because we're different people doesn't mean they have to have the same ways of, of handling the problems I mean I-- like about the call last night. Right, the main point I was crying is just trying to tell you that I would have handle it different. I wouldn't have called you yelling, I wouldn't have called you stupid. 

00:21:55
DAVID I agree, I agree, I agree. Okay. 

00:21:55
PATTY If you got now that-- of that well just... 

00:21:55
DAVID No, because it's not the truth. Okay, because I-- like I said, and like you agreed with I did not do that at the beginning - 

00:22:05
PATTY No, I was... 

00:22:05
DAVID - that didn't come later or after there was frustration when you change, tearing-- you said, "Okay, let's not do this, this is true." You're an obviously someone whose I think is upset and at this point, I, I assure that you want... 

00:22:15
PATTY No, when we talk about the car-- when you asked me did you notice that my car was not sounding like, and I said maybe-- I said I noticed cuz I don't-- that I didn't think there was anything wrong and... 

00:22:25
DAVID No, that is not what you said. What I first ask you about, that seem you're lying again. 

00:22:30
PATTY I'm not. 

00:22:30
DAVID That is not what you said. You said, "No, I never noticed anything different about it David(ph)." 

00:22:40
PATTY I didn't noticed the difference. I noticed the flat but I didn't notice that there was any difference between the cars. 

00:22:40
DAVID Okay, but the point is precisely what you said. Okay, that's really important Patty(ph). 

00:22:50
PATTY Okay, what I was trying to say though the point of all that was that as soon as I said that and the car at the time I said, "No, I didn't noticed any difference. I did notice about it but I-- it wasn't-- I mean, I didn't notice the difference." 

00:23:00
DAVID That's not what you said. 

00:23:05
PATTY Well, that's not what I said but the bottom line was that I didn't notice any difference. I, I did notice about it but it was just a normal part of your car, I didn't think anything different about it but I noticed... 

00:23:15
DAVID Okay, but another problem is that-- what is another problem about that upset me? 

00:23:20
PATTY Well, that, that's the first thing I said and then you said you don't have any-- call me stupid... 

00:23:20
DAVID But why did I get mad? Why would call you call stupid? Why would I get mad? 

00:23:25
PATTY Because I didn't notice anything different because... 

00:23:30
DAVID There's, there's one problem but a small of it and I can deal with... 

00:23:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, so there is the domineering behavior. And he-- well, go on to say that, ah, the-- he's just the fighting-- calling her stupid. And that what he wants when he calls her stupid is empathy and the problem is she has no empathy for him. And he's gonna be instructing her on how to be empathetic when he's threatening. And here is, here is the opposite. Here is the Cobra. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Would I be wrong in thinking you have an attitude? 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:15
JOHN GOTTMAN And noticed that he's-- the plain of his face is the opposite, he's leading with his chin rather than his forehead and, and we'll see enough of this just so you can see the, the belligerence and he starts off by saying, "Would I be wrong in thinking that you have an attitude?" 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Then you're upset about something? 

00:24:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Paul Ekman noticed that this guy is engage in very rapid heaf-- head movements that are very threatening. 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN But... 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN You haven't learned-- neither one or two subjects so... 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Oh, my drugs. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Which do you wanna talk about sex or communication? 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN It's still communication. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN Ah, okay. Why don't we communicate? 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Cuz you wanna hear what you want and you change everything I say? Don't interrupt me. 

00:25:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, you see that how threatening that is? You know, anyway that's kind of enough of that. So those are the-- that's the Pit Ball and the Cobra. Okay, uhm, let me try to find-- back to the power point, all right. 

00:26:00
CHARACTEROLOGICAL VIOLENCE • Asymmetrical with cleat perpetrator and victim. • Controlling and dominating behavior, or belligerence. • Perpetrators show little remorse. • Perpetrators attribute blame to victim. • Victim fears perpetrator. • Pit Bulls or Cobras (Gottman & Jacobson) • Cobras exhibit similar behaviors outside the family. • Victim has no control over perpetrator. • Shelter victims mostly fit into this category. • Show films 

00:26:00
JOHN GOTTMAN So that's characterological domestic violence, those are two types. And by the way they're equally dangerous. Equally dangerous. So that guy you saw, she actually divorced that guy and one day he arrived at her door step even though there was a restraining order against his going near her with a whitetail around his arm. And he ask, "Can I just come in and talk to you?" And she said, "Oh, okay." And then as they were sitting there he-- she noticed that he was holding a pistol, right at her. He didn't kill her but that gives you some idea of how dangerous they both are. 

00:26:35
SITUATIONAL VIOLENCE IS DIFFERENT • Violence is reciprocal - No clear perpetrator for victim. • Does not involve control or dominance. • Those involved show remorse, understand its impact, and internalize blame. • Often arises from conflict that has escalated out of control. • Does not escalate to characterological domestic violence (Jacobson & Gottman study) 

00:26:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, now. So situational domestic violence is different. The violence is reciprocal, in fact Donald Dutton's, ah, book the Domestic Assault of women shows that in situational domestic violence, 71% of the time women throw the first punch, or the first object. And they don't do as much damage as men do. But situational domestic violence does not involved control or dominance like the Pit Balls and Cobras. Ah, those involved in, ah, and it show remorse, they don't externalize blame. They take, they take responsibility. And often the conflict, ah, has escalate out of control and, ah, and it does never escalate the characterological domestic violence. 

00:27:20
COUPLES WHO ARE IN COUPLE'S THERAPY • O'Leary study found that 67% of all couples in couples' therapy have been violent with one another. • Yet most couple's therapists do not assess for domestic violence. • Most of these violent couples are probably situational violent, not characterologically violent. 

00:27:20
JOHN GOTTMAN O'Leary by the way, ah, Dan O'Leary at, ah, University of New York at Stony Brook found that 67% of all couples and couples' therapy. So your clients if you couples have had at least one violent episode with one another. In fact, Leonard's research showed that 36% of all newlyweds in the United States in America have had a violent fight probably a situational domestic violence before they marry. That we're a very violent country, physically violent and yet most therapists does assess for domestic violence systematically. Now we make our therapist do that and we assess for domestic violence. And most of these couples are probably situationally domestic violence not characterologically domestically violent. 

00:28:10
OUT THEORY ABOUT SITUATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE • TWO PARTS • 1. The lack of social skills in dealing with conflict is a central part of situational domestic violence. • 2. Diffuse physiological arousal (DPA) plays a major role in the escalation of conflict toward physical violence. DPA creates dysregulation in negative emotions. 

00:28:10
JOHN GOTTMAN So may not know about domestic violence in your clients. So here is our theory of situational domestic violence. There are two things that these couples need. First of all, they lack the social skills in dealing with conflict. Okay. And second, they get so physiologically aroused, they get into diffuse physiological arousal and that plays a major role on the escalation of conflict toward physical violence. So they need to be able to self-soothe and down regulate their own physiology, both people, both men and women in this argument. So during conflict they need to really be able to self-soothe, and they need to learn new social skills. 

00:28:50
EVIDENCE OF SKILLS DEFICITS IN DV • Substantial evidence now exists that dysfunctional relationship conflict plays a role in DV. • Sample of 11,870 randomly selected military personnel, marital discord best predictor of DV. For every 20% increase in discord odds of milder DV increased 102% and severe DV by 183%. (Pan, Nelding, & O'Leary, 1994) • Compared to unhappy nonviolent couples, DV couples reciprocate negative affect more, are more hostile, don't exit negative sequences as easily, or as fast, have no exit withdrawal ritual, reject influence from women, reverse demand-withdraw patterns, show more belligerence, less empathy, less positive effect, more domineering, defensiveness, disgust, anger, contempt, and tension. 

00:28:50
JOHN GOTTMAN So there is a lot of evidence of skill deficits and domestic violence, the study that, you know, and I did found that in really coding, ah, second by second coding the videotapes comparing situationally domestic violent couples with characterologically domestic fli-- violent couples with, ah, nonviolent couples who are unhappy and, ah, fourth group of happily married couples. You know, there was this little deficit in social skills. A sample of, ah, almost 12,000 peoples', ah, in the military found that marital discord was the best predictor of, of domestic violence. For every 20% increase in domestic violence, the odds of-- even milder domestic violence increased by a 1o2% and si-- and severe domestic violence a 183%. So the quality of the relationship which has a lot to do with their social skills in dealing with conflict and intimacy is really related to domestic violence and situational and more severe domestic violence, not characterological. And characterological is nothing the woman does that initiates or terminates the violence. Very different pattern. 

00:30:00
IN TREATMENT, CAN WE SCREEN OUT CHARACTEROLOGICAL DV? • Yes, our lab developed an effective screening tool for screening out characterological perpetrators. Three criteria: - Amount and type of violence - use CTS2 - Fear of Partner - Social Control of Partner • The Intimate Justice Scale does almost as well as our scale, except for an under-reporting of situational DV by women on that scale. 

00:30:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. So, what we need to do is in treatment, we need to screen out the characterological domestic violence. Can we do that? And the answer is yes. So our lab developed an effective screening tool f-- it was a questionnaire for screening out the characterological domestic violence. And here are the three criteria that are necessary. The amount and type of violence on the conflict tactics scale, this to be looked at. So situational domestic violence, the, you know, the violence is not as severe. There's not an-- they don't use a knife or gun. They don't you know, beat up their partner. They don't you know, ah, cause internal organ damage or broken bones. And the other thing that characterizes characterological domestic violence is that the woman is afraid of the perpetrator. So fear is an important dimension. And the-- and the third thing is that both Pit Balls and Cobras are engaging in social control. In other words, they're isolating the victim. They're, ah, they're using public humiliation, they're engaging in coercive sexuality, ah, often rape. So those three criteria are easy to, to measure. And there's another scale called the intimate justice scale that does almost as well the scale we developed looking at those three dimensions except that there is an under-reporting of, of domestic violence by women on the intimate justice scale. So it's pretty good. You know, it's really, it's good enough but it's not perfect. 

00:31:40
GOTTMAN ET AL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SCREENING PROCEDURE September 21, 2005 SEVERITY SCREEN (CTS2, 19 items) No DV Incidents (Score of zero on all items) "Minor" Violence in past 6 months (Score of 1-6 on any Minor Items (#1,2, 4-6) Severe Violence, Not in past 6 months (Score of "7" on any Severe items #3, 7-19) Severe Violence in past 6 months (Scores of 1-6 on Severe items #3, 7-19) SCREEN FOR CHARACTER VIOLENCE SCREEN FOR CHARACTER VIOLENCE EXCLUDE SCREEN FOR CHARACTEROLOGICAL VIOLENCE (7 items) 2 or Fewer Yes Responses 3 or More Yes Responses SCREEN FOR FEAR OF PARTNER EXCLUDE SCREEN FOR FEAR OF PARTNER (3 Items) 

00:31:45
JOHN GOTTMAN So we developed this, ah, complicated flow chart for screening out the-- though we needed to select couples that had violence, right, had situational domestic violence but exclude the ones that are characterological. And this is sort of what we went through in, in our screening. It gives you an idea of the complexity of doing this. But the point is that this is reliable and valid. We can actually do this. 

00:32:10
WHAT PROPORTION OF DV IS SITUATIONAL VERSUS CHARACTEROLOGICAL? • The answer in the Jacobson-Gottman study was that 80% of DV is situational, 20% is characterological. Estimates range between 50 and 80% situational DV. • Police reports bear these 80/20 % estimates out. • Characterological incidents get all the media attention, so we think it is the most common form of DV. It's not. Victims show up in shelters. • Note: in most states in the Union, a couples' treatment is against the law after a domestic violence incident. 

00:32:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. Now, what proportion of domestic violence is situational? And what proportion is characterological? And in our study that Neil Jacobson and I did, 80% of domestic violence is situational, right. Now, police are very interested in this because you know, interrupt the domestic violent dispute you can get killed, right? And so-- now it's a low probability event but you don't know when you into a home, is this gonna be a situational where that happens? How should you treat this? And so, only 20% of, ah, domestic violence is characterological. Well, you know it turns our 20% if you Adrian Raine's book and other books on violence, 20% of the criminals commit 85% of the crimes, you know. Isn't that interesting? And if you get interested in alcohol addiction, you'll find there are types of alcohol addicts. There are ones where alcohol has very little physiological effect until they drink more and more. And they are physiologically under aroused. And another group that get drunk much more easily. Okay. Again, you have these two types, right. So these two types you can see in almost all psychopathology. All right. Police reports bear out this 80/20 estimate but we're not sure. It could be 60/40. So it's hard to get really good randomized data you know, that really representative of the United States are-- ah, on domestic violence just cuz people hang up, right. So you can't really do this, ah, really can't get good numbers here. Now, here's the interesting thing. And 31 states in the United States, it is illegal to use a couples' approach to treating domestic violence. You have to u-- you have to put the batterer in an all male group, okay, as a treatment. And Julia Babcock whose, ah, a former student of Neil Jacobson and, and myself whose a professor at the University of Houston and award-winning researcher, really wonderful researcher in the area of domestic violence, discover that, uhm, in, in a meta-analysis she did analyzing all of the interventions that are batterer only interventions. None of them was any more effective that just one arrest. So the Duluth Model, all of these models that you've read about, and heard about are ineffective, they do not work. In her meta-analysis, she actually showed that in some cases, the all male batterers actually get worst in domestic violence. They learn from other batterers. There's only been one study that shows that in fact you can make a difference and that was done by Sandra Stith and I'll talk about that in a minute. So the advocates who run shelters have been effective in changing a law so that you can't use a couples group. All right. 

00:35:15
JACOBSON & GOTTMAN STUDY • 9-year longitudinal study • Had 4 groups: (1) Happy non-violent, (2) Unhappy non-violent, (3) Situational DV, (3) Characterological DV (male perpetrators only) • No situational DV COUPLE escalated to characterological or more serious DV. The 2 groups remained distinct. • Discovered two types of characterological DV perpetrators: "Pit Bulls" and "Cobras" • CONCLUSION: Situational violence may occur with couples who lack conflict resolution skills, or extreme physiological reactivity. HISTORY OF TREATMENT FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE • Social service programs mostly do not distinguish between the two types of DV. • All male group interventions have no effect beyond what is achieved by arrest alone shown by Julia Babcock's meta-analysis. Effect sizes .01 and .12, that is essentially nonexistent. • Yet these treatments are mandated by law in many states in USA. Couples' treatment is mostly illegal! • The fear is that couples' treatment blames the woman • Yet in situational DV women do throw first punch or object 71% of time (Dutton, 1995). Women can indeed be violent. DV not uncommon among lesbians. Bullying in middle and high school - female aggression now very well documented. COUPLES TREATMENT FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE? • Couples interventions are criticized for placing women at increased risk, and implying that the victim is partially to blame. • Most states mandate NO COUPLES' TREATMENT FOR DV (Babcock, Green, & Robie 2004) • Many agencies refuse to recognize that SITUATIONAL DV exists at all. Will not cooperate with research. This is a very highly politicized field. • Yet a small study by Stith et al. (2004) showed promising results: a group intervention for couples experiencing only situational DV was effective at nearly eliminating recidivism of violence and improving relationship satisfaction, with no increase in risk at 1 year. 

00:35:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Now, I already mention this, ah, study that Neil and I did, and, ah, ah, you know, I'll skip over this slide. Uhm, by all these slides are available on, on the evolution of psychotherapy, ah, website. Okay. So, so this is, this is what Julia Babcock discovered the effect sizes are between .01 and .12 in other words, the effect sizes of all male batterer are nonexistent. These-- none of these programs work. And, ah, and yet, you know, if we think about treating situation domestic violence, what the data is suggesting makes the most sense, is to work on the relationship between, between, the cou-- ah, the partners and the, and the relationship. Okay, so, uhm, I've already talked about that. Okay, I'll skip this slide also. 

00:36:15
STITH, ROSEN, & MCCOLLUM: GROUP COUPLES TREATMENT FOR DV STUDY • Screened out characterological batterers, but not do so systematically. • Stith and McCollum used a solution-focused treatment, both couples' group, and couple therapy. Only couples' group treatment effective. • Findings: Male recidivism rates were lower for experimental (25%) than comparison (67%), significant in reducing partner violence. • Either a couples' group or just usual couples' therapy equally effective. 

00:36:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Ah, and here is the only study that's been done that has ever been shown any effectiveness in treating situational domestic violence. And this is done by Sandra Stith, S-T-I-T-H. Ah, Stith, Rosen and McCollum did a couples' group treatment for domestic violence. So these are small groups of couples, and they use a sol-- solution-focused, ah, treatment. They screened out characterological, ah, batterers just like were-- we did in our study only they didn't have a method of doing it that could be replicated. So they sort of did it intuitively and clinically but we try to get a questionnaire that anybody could use. And it was also very hard to know what the intervention was. They found that only the couples' group treatment was effective and in fact the recidivism rates were lower in the experimental group. They had 25% recit-- recidivism rate of you know, based on police reports of these batterers situationally violent couples continuing to do the violence on follow-up inco-- in comparison to 67% in the comparison group. Now, in the study there was no random assignment to, ah, experimental group and control group. And, ah, and it-- it was, ah,-- it's a very provocative study and that-- and their book is go-- their study has been published as a book by the American Psychological Association. So it's quite interesting. 

00:37:45
PROBLEMS WITH THE STITH-MCCOLLUM STUDY • Only 1/3 of their couples were lower-income. • Small samples were used. • No clear screening tool. • No randomization. • Intervention was not skill-based and no recognition of the role of physiological arousal in violence. • Their "solution-focused" intervention consisted of: (1) purposely not focusing on couples' emotions, (2) telling couples that no violence would be permitted, that it was wrong, and (3) telling people that they already knew how to end their violence. • Procedures seemed confusing, imprecise, and hard to duplicate or disseminate to others. • Intervention is hard to replicate. 

00:37:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Now, but there's some problems with their even though it's a-- it really is a landmark groundbreaking study and very important. Only a third of their couples were lower income are they-- have very, very small samples. No clear screening tool. No randomization. And, ah, and the intervention, ah, are purposely ignored the couples emotions. So they, they quoted Salvador Minuchin in the, ah, introduction to their book and, and Sal had said that he never talks to violent couples about their feelings. And so, ah, and the Stith study they decided that they would not talk to couples about emotions and they would also not teach them any social skills for dealing with the conflict or help them reduce their physiological arousal and self-soothe. So all the intervention really said you already know the answer to not being violent. You already know what to do to not be violent. And you figure out what it is that you do when you're not violent. This is the solution-focused approach. You already know the answer and, and a lot of the couples they quoted in this book are, ah, were quite confused about the intervention they've said-- sort say, well, you know, we sort of came here to learn something new but they told us we already knew what to do. Ah, but they got-- they got really nice results even though you know, they did that. I don't know what really they did, and I actually got a copy of their treatment manual. And honestly, you know, oh, I really Sandra Stith a lot, she's a very nice person. I couldn't figure out really how to run the group based on their manual. So I think their intervention be kinda hard to replicate. Uhm, so those are problems that even though this a wonderful groundbreaking study with very good result, so think of it as a study with situational domestic violence to really, ah, be successful. 

00:39:45
BACK TO BABIES: RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS: WEEKEND PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION WITH MIDDLE-CLASS COUPLES • John & Julie Gottman's book "And Baby Makes Three" • Bringing Baby Home program (see www.gottman.com) • Reversed the drop in relationship satisfaction. • Reduced hostility between parents. • Reduced incidence of post-partum depression in mothers from 62.5% to 23.5%. • Dramatically increased father involvement. Dramatically increased father's positive feelings towards baby. • Increased father's cooperation with mother. • Improved baby's emotional and cognitive development at 1-year follow-up. 

00:39:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Now, if we go back to, ah, back to babies and randomized clinical trial. Oh, I already talked about this. Ah, but we found that, uhm, not only was this two-day workshop, you know, this 10-hour workshop effective and changing the drop in relationship satisfaction and reducing hostility between parents, but by teaching these social skills about conflict then intimacy, we reduce the incidents of postpartum depression in mothers, ah, with 62.5% had symptoms of postpartum depression in the control group only 23.5% had any experimental group. We also dramatically increased father involved with the baby and that went for both mom-- ah, sons as well as daughters. So this was the first study that really got fathers involved with babies. All other studies had failed at doing that. And there was one study by Ross Parke, ah, where fathers got more involved in sons but not daughters. But in this case, working on the relationship, they got much more involved in both sons and daughters. So fathers did more housework, they did more childcare, they got up more in the middle of the night with the baby and so on. 

00:41:05
OUR CHALLENGES • Lower-income people probably didn't have a great experience with school. • Presentation method needed to be exciting and involving. • Didn't want our program to feel like a classroom, where participants might feel lectured to and judged. 

00:41:05
JOHN GOTTMAN So, okay. So what, what are our challenges when we go to - 

00:41:05
JULIE GOTTMAN John, that's my part. 

00:41:10
JOHN GOTTMAN - okay, that's right it's your part. Okay. 

00:41:15
JULIE GOTTMAN So there. You know, I, I want to start by giving my appreciation to every single one of you because every single one of you is concerned about the issue of domestic violence. And domestic violence is one of-- one of the most important scourges of our culture, of our society not only in this country but all over the world. So the fact that you are sitting here listening, uhm, after many days of listening shows your dedication and your devotion to working with the most difficult couples. And I so appreciate you and I wanna give applause for you, so thank you. Okay, hmm, so our challenges we-- were the following. We were working with lower-income couples and these were really the couples in the poorest communities initially. Uhm, they were couples who came from the deep south, they often were people of color and they had, had experiences in school which were terrible. They often had been disrespected and shamed in school. And so we knew that the two-day workshop bringing baby home that we had given which was much more lecture than doing exercises was way too much like school and we would lose the couples if we created a program that was identical to that. So we had to come up with something that really met our couples where they lived inside themselves. So the presentation method had to be exciting, I didn't want it to look like a classroom. 

00:43:20
WITH LOWER-INCOME PEOPLE WE NEEDED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM • Needed to make program structured and didactic so it was replicable by others • Teach information and skills needed to succeed as a couple and family. • Allow for spontaneity. • Foster respect, counteract shame and disrespect expected from authority figures by lower-income people. • Give couples sense of pride in making it as family. • Create community for couples to connect with each other. • To prevent attrition, couples needed to come to meetings for each other, not just to hear facilitators. 

00:43:20
JULIE GOTTMAN So what we wanted was something that was less didactic, less structured. We wanted to be able to give the information to couples in terms of teaching skills and so on. But not in the formula that folks were, were meeting in schools. We wanted also, this was so profoundly important. We wanted to foster respect for these people in their attempts to create families, raise children with poverty, with the stresses poverty and racism etcetera. We wanted to counteract the shame that they were greeted with probably most days of their lives. We wanted to give them a sense of pride in making it as a family and to create communities of couples. We knew that you know, here we were or highfalutin educated, ah, facilitators who they wouldn't be able to relate to. So we knew that if we created a program based on their deep and love for us, they would drop out like flies. We wanted to create a program where they would connect with one another that's who they would come for, not us but for each other. 

00:45:00
WE DEVELOPED A COUPLES' "CURRICULUM," WITH A CHILD FOCUS AS WELL • We designed 42 modules on specific issues. Talk-show videos begin each module. • Structured skill training and information. • But couples group is the center of intervention. • Mathematica and MDRC conducted randomized clinical trial in 7 states. - "CURRICULUM" program most effective with African-American couples - "CURRICULUM" program more effective with married couples. - "CURRICULUM" program later extended to include foster parents. 

00:45:00
JULIE GOTTMAN So we developed first a couple's curriculum, we called it a curriculum and we designed 42 modules. These modules had to do with the social skills as well as reaching each other, partners together at a very deep level talking about their old traumas for example, talking about their struggles, talking about their own families. So just doing social skills was great but we needed more than that. We were involved in a huge, huge, uhm, research study with a, ah, social policy think tank called Mathematica as well as another one called MDRC in which, ah, as research study was done with 3,000 couples all over the deep south in the poorest areas as well as in Bronx as well as in the Baltimore Ghetto. How many of you have seen the TV show The Wire? One of the great shows of all time. Well, that's where we were working. Uhm, so six out seven states chose our program out of 48 programs to apply to couples. And the curriculum was given by social service agencies in each of these communities. So I travelled around the country and trained people at these agencies to do our curriculum and to facilitate small groups of couples who would meet together two hours a week. And I'll tell you what it's-- what that look like. Uhm, just a fast forward for a moment, what we found were-- well, actually what we didn't Mathematica and MDRC conducted the research. So we just presented the programs to couples. Uhm, they found that most effective with African-American couples. Uhm, most effective with married couples as well and later on it was extended to include foster parents where it also worked. 

00:47:35
ADAPTED "CURRICULUM" TO "COUPLES TOGETHER AGAINST VIOLENCE" CURRICULUM • "CURRICULUM" topics adopted to focus more heavily on conflict management. • Included methods for managing emotional flooding through physiological soothing. • Rituals developed for withdrawing from escalating conflict. • Included mechanisms for ensuring safety • Useful for broader population of couples with children. 

00:47:35
JULIE GOTTMAN So we took this particular curriculum and then in our own research lab, we adapted it to fit our couples research with domestic violence that is situational domestic violence. And what we wanted to do was emphasize much-- for am-- for containing emotional flooding, physiological flooding withdrawing, uhm, was very important when conflict became escalated and people were physiologically feeling out of control. We needed to give couples a way to cope with physiological state which I'll talk about in a minute. We also wanted to of course include mechanisms for ensuring safety. Uhm, and we wanted this to be useful for a broader population with children as well. So we included parenting information too. 

00:48:45
FOCUS OF RESEARCH • Formally test a screening instrument for distinguishing between types of violence. • Target couples who are experiencing low levels of situational violence. • Include special emphasis on skills for reducing violence. • Analyze whether reduced situational violence leads to healthier marriage and responsible fatherhood. • Intervention named "Couples Together Against Violence," or CTAV 

00:48:45
JULIE GOTTMAN The focus of our research was the following. First of all, we wanted to formally test this screening method, the screening method that differentiated characterological domestic violence. The Pit Balls and the Cobras from situational domestic violence, the ones we thought we could help. Our last worst nightmare was including characterologically domestic violence in a sample that kept couples together because we knew the terrible danger that, that could create for women. So the screening had to work and work next to perfect. So, the first thing we did is we tested the screening instrument to make sure it was reliable. So wanted to target couples who had low levels of domestic violence and analyze whether reducing the situational domestic violence and giving them ways of building friendship, ways of handling conflict, not eliminating it. That doesn't work. But managing conflict in a way that had more gentleness to it, more calmness. Giving them alternatives that were very com-- about how to manage conflict would reduce and eliminate domestic violence as well as producing have more satisfying relationships. And we call this intervention CTAV, couples together against violence. 

00:50:40
RESEARCH APPROACH • Longitudinal randomized clinical trial comparing CTAV intervention to no-treatment control group. • Couples screened carefully to rule out characterological violence using our screening instrument. • Eligibility based on female partner's report of violence, and Personality Assessment Inventory. Screened out antisocial personality disorder and alcohol-drug addiction. • Low level situational violence couples in both groups. • In addition, telephone interview plus in-home assessment. • Randomly assigned to treatment or control groups, 96 couples in each. 

00:50:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Our research approach was to do a longitudinal randomized clinical trial comparing CTAV intervention to a no-treatment control group. So first, couples were recruited then very carefully screened for the type of domestic violence so that we could eliminate characterologically domestic violence from our samples. The eligibility for couples in our program was based on the females reports of the violence, a personality assessment inventory, the PAI. We also screened out antisocial personality disorder and alcohol and drug addiction that was in full process. So, we had low level situational domestic violence in both groups and then we randomly assigned couples to either treatment or no treatment, that's the-- standard for the best research. 

00:51:50
EVALUATION METHOD • Baseline assessment. • Three follow-up assessments at 6, 12, and 24 month's post-randomization. HOME VISITS. • Assessment include 15 minute video-taped conflict discussion while physiological data measured. • Videotapes coded with Gottman SPAFF system. • Physiological measures and observational leave more room for sensitive measures of change. • Police records used as well as self-report on DV. • Control group given information on safety and DV. 

00:51:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Our evaluation was the following. We did a baseline assessment, then we did three follow-up assessments, longitudinal six months, 12 months and 24 months. So we followed these couples for two years. The assessments included a 15-minute videotape conflict discussion which we then-- hi, hi Mr. Mike(ph) okay, really? Okay. What? Okay. So, I have to talk into this now. So it included this 15-minute observed videotape. And the reason that was so important is when you have couples just doing pen or pencil and paper, questionnaires, written evaluations they will report things in a biased way. If they like you, they'll report it in a way that favors the treatment. If they hate you, they'll do the opposite, but most of the time you know, there is this kind of social, uhm, biased that is created by some gratitude to the facilitators so they make nice and say nice things, very different when they're being videotaped. So we analyze them having conflict discussions for 15 minutes from baseline before treatment to after treatment then six months, 12 months, 24 months. We analyze those tapes hundredth of a second by hundredth of a second using, uhm, a method called spaff, S-P-A-F-F coding. So coding their facial expressions, their voices, the content of what they were expressing that has been, uhm, shown by John's research, his lab created it for, uhm, very high reliability and validity. We also took physiological meador-- measures of what was happening inside their bodies during their conflict discussions. Police records were used as well as some self report on the actual domestic violence. Our control group did not receive any treatment, what they got was information on safety and just domestic violence, basic statistics information. 

00:54:40
OUR "MODULE" CONCEPT • Couples meet together in small groups with up to 6 couples and 2 facilitators per group. • Each group meeting covers 1 module. Same group meets together throughout curriculum to create community. • Every module starts with 15-minute video of talk show on that week's topic. • Then information given in understandable language. • Then skill-building exercise is conducted to teach couples skills of successful relationship. Exercises may be fun or may facilitate deeper connection with partner and/or group. 

00:54:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Our module concept look like this, a couple would meet together in a small group with two facilitators. There were usually six couples in a group. Each group meeting lasted two hours and would meet once a week. The same group of couples met week after week for about 21 weeks with those two facilitators. Every module would start with a 15-minute video of a talk show that I created with couples in poverty. And I'll tell you about those in a minute. Also what we did is after couples' started by watching a videotape that was related to the topic of that week, facilitators were trained to really support discussion between the couples where they disclose their own experience, their own challenges, their own triumphs, their own successes, the times where they had fallen down, the times in long ago past that perhaps brought them to the current moment. Their discussions were interrupted by teaching, by, ah, well you did that wrong, let me tell you what you should have done instead. None of that took place. We wanted to create bonding and connection between the couples. So half the group time was devoted to those discussions where no teaching, no information was given, and connection wen-- and respect was really promoted. Compassion for one another was promoted. Afterwards about an hour into the meeting, there would be a little information given about the topic and an alternative tool for them to use in understandable language then an exercise would be given that would teach the couple skills of successful relationships. Now, the exercises could be fun and they might be doing them either as a whole group or just with their partners privately, or they would facilitate deeper connection either between partners or within the whole group. 

00:57:35
CTAV VIDEOS • Talk show videos stars are couples from lower-income populations from Atlanta, Baltimore and Seattle. • Julie Gottman was the "Oprah" for this study • Couples discuss topics like preventing harmful fights, avoiding domestic violence, healing from infidelity, building friendship and intimacy, and creating positive legacies for their children. 

00:57:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm, let me, ah, there was one other thing that I'll mention later but I wanna introduce it now. Before couples did an exercise, every single time, we gave them a little biofeedback device called an emWave which is made by HeartMath a wonderful wonderful company who donated the devices. The emWave at that time, this was few years ago was a marvelous tool. It look like a little cell phone, it had a bank of lights on it. And also one particular light that change color almost like a mood ring, it went from red to blue to green. It-- the device was with a wire attached to the ear, a little clip which measured heart rate synchronicity. Also a little panel of lights on the biofeedback device would move up and down, and control a partners breathing. The person would breathe along with that panel of lights, then the, the people when they were using the device were instructed to have a positive thought about something and to see if they could move that colored light out of the red zone through the blue zone and into green and keep it in the green zone. That biofeedback device, we held onto as facilitators so you know, they weren't taking them home. They would use it for five minutes before they did the exercise. So they were basically through 21 weeks of this, five minutes a week changing their physiology and by gully it worked which was incredible. And now the emWave comes as a little teeny app that can plug into a phone and when you hold the phone it does the same thing. It's really quite marvelous. Okay, so, the talk show videos, let's talk about those for a minute. What we did is, uhm, with our contacts across the country, we brought in about 15 couples to Seattle Washington and we-- these were all couples who had been in poverty, were still poverty many of them, they were from Florida, Louisiana, Baltimore as well as Seattle. They were couples who were struggling with infidelity, domestic violence, they'd also been incarcerated many of them. They were dealing with escalated quarrels with how the heck to have sex when you've got four little kids under the age of 5, how do you do that? They were talking about that. So they came into a TV studio and I would meet with three couples at a time for an hour and talk to them to bring out their knowledge, their wisdom, their experience, not mine, theirs most important. And help them by respecting them to disclose more and more about their own experience. We then edited down those films to about 15-minute clips which we then would show at the beginning of every single module. 

01:01:30
MODULES CREATE COMMUNITY AND LEARNING • Talk show videos help couples feel less alone with their struggles and triumphs, and lead to self-disclosure. • Group discussions weave couples together into supportive communities. • Information is provided in straightforward, clear language. • Exercises teach skills while deepening connections between partners. • Before every exercise couples use Emwave, biofeedback device that helps teach physiological self-soothing. • Show collage video. 

01:01:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Do you wanna show it? 

01:01:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Ah, not, not quite. So the modules created community, they created learning and the thing that was so key here was that the couples on the videotape resembled the couples who were watching the videotape, that was the point. Let's not bring in nice middle class you know, fancy educated couples. We wanted couple that our subjects could relate to in order to encourage them to talk, in order to show them that this was a program with respect with for what they had to say. So let's show a collage, we took a few segments of some of these videos and we wanna show you little snippets of them.

You know and understand I wasn't the best guy, you know, I did I lot of things and you know a lot of times I was, uhm, disrespected-- when I disrespected myself. And then for me to get to a position where I'm-- am-- I put myself out of a lot of bad things that I was doing and I haven't no found respect for myself was someone I dis-- disrespect me in that, in that-- in the way that I was being disrespect before when I kinda deserve it. You know, cuz it's one of the reasons that I put out of that is to not have to go that again.

UNKNOWN God, is that painful? 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, and it happened right away so I thought-- this, this can't be postpartum depression cuz I had heard that it happens a month, three months after you have the baby. So it was really hard. And one day I just, ah, or about four days after I, ah, hadn't been sleeping in four days and it was just getting too much. And I went to take a bath to try to relax and, I just thought I, I need to, I need to kill myself. There's no way that I-- I'm not gonna give the child for adoption because that would be horrible and you know, so and you know, I just felt like a horrible, horrible person. You know, why would I have these thoughts?

UNKNOWN This is something I did and, and I'm trying to fix that now. 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN How-- you don't wanna have a baby?

UNKNOWN I did. Ah, ah, I was hysterical but when I saw the huge smile on his face he was on his way to work, and he was coming down the steps. And he said to me, he say, "so what they say?" And I was like he's gonna head up-- you know, I say, say no, I say no. I said yes. He say, "Yeah! Oh, yeah! I'm gonna be a father?" He was so happy and it took into about my fourth month to, to, you know, like accept this. I always say, "He wants to be here. He's gonna, he's gonna be here with here." I just want him to be there. I, I wouldn't care if you know, if it did happen you know, and then addiction came upon you know, our lives, you know, anything. As long as my son knows that his father loves him, he-- he's there, that-- that's your father. No one can take that on his place in my son's life. 

01:10:40

01:11:10
UNKNOWN Oh. 

01:11:10
UNKNOWN She has things-- she has to do so, I used to be violent. I used to be on drugs to a very bad extent.

UNKNOWN So, I had no limits. 

01:11:20

01:11:25
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. Wow. 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's only-- it get-- it just get-- it's just got to be to a point to where you can't pull with yourself enough to know when you're wrong. So a lot of times I know when I'm wrong. You got to be able to know when you're wrong and when you just need to stop like dance even, even if the other person - 

01:11:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:11:40
UNKNOWN - is maybe wrong also. 

01:11:40
UNKNOWN How do you know when you're getting close to that boiling point, too close, how do you know it inside? 

01:11:45
UNKNOWN You, you got to, to get there long be-- you had to know long before you get there that it's going that route cuz - 

01:11:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:11:55
UNKNOWN - when-- like she said, was, was beg to me-- I may not be-- beg to her, so when I see that she's really not making this conversation go to way I want -

UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:12:05
UNKNOWN - and I don't see me getting less upset - 

01:12:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:12:05
UNKNOWN - that's when it's time for me to stop talking. 

01:12:10
Infidelity 

01:12:10
UNKNOWN Could you tell us a little bit about how infidelity affected you? What happened? 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Took away trust. 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Took away trust. All right. 

01:12:20
UNKNOWN Ah, to trust. 

01:12:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:12:20
UNKNOWN Even though what happened when we first got together the point it was still the trust at the time, it may, it may cause what you think every time he left, every time he will go somewhere, it was to see a person or to sleep with a person or he was with another person. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN So it killed a lot of trust. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. And Carlos(ph) for you it must have been difficult too cuz here you are facing a woman who is scared, who's angry, who's you know, having all kinds of suspicions, what was that like for you? 

01:13:00
CARLOS It was kinda rough I guess just to-- like kinda like right now fighting just to get her respect back and her trust and it was like - 

01:13:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:13:10
CARLOS - I gotta do so much. It's like she extorted me you know, at the same time everything that I'm-- I have to do for just to get that respect and trust back. 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:13:15
Infidelity 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN Hey, if you want me to have a bigger behind, buy me some butt pads I mean - 

01:13:20
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:13:20
UNKNOWN - I mean, if you want me to have longer hair, buy some hair wig. I mean it's like whatever you choose you woman to, make her that way. 

01:13:30
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:13:30
UNKNOWN If you want me to be a stripper, I'm a big woman. Hey, I'll fly down the poles if it will make you happy. 

01:13:40
UNKNOWN Cool yeah. 

01:13:40
UNKNOWN If you feel that you're bored, do some to make it better. 

01:13:40
Infidelity 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, my friends was like my family. Uhm, we did everything together you know. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

01:13:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, I mean everything, and so, uhm, I think to a degree-- I mean I'm looking back on it now but, uhm, there's something about being around the fellas and having their approval that made the wo-- meant the world to me. There are some women that I would have sex with because I can go back at the barbershop and be like, "Yeah, I hit that." 

01:14:15
UNKNOWN Everything that I built up until that point when our relationship felt like it was all in vain - 

01:14:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:14:20
UNKNOWN - it felt like, what I had tried to give could never be good enough. And so it's almost like because so much of me wants to do so much for him that he would-- he-- I mean, taking him that didn't mean anything that the last five years of our life meant nothing to him - 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN - and we did went through so much and I stood by his side for everything. And so it was like one of the most-- it was almost like him turning his back on me and pushing away this great part of me that I tried to give to him. 

01:14:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, I wasn't bad shake-- I mean, our relationship was, uhm, you know, was, was pretty much a thread was holding-- holding us together. 

01:15:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:15:05
UNKNOWN And I was ready to just you know, because of that you know, uhm, what happened was, uhm, I think after, uhm, after looking back over everything I had been through, uhm, she was there did the whole thing - 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN - cuz I was a teenager and I up chasing after the game, chasing after my partners and things that we would together, uhm, and then I, I remember-- just kind of thinking about my life and, uhm, she's there, did the whole thing through have of my adult life, my teenage life. She was there and, ah, and got-- kinda solving you know. I came to, to this point where I was like, "God, she has proved that she love me."

MODULES CREATE COMMUNITY AND LEARNING • Talk show videos help couples feel less alone with their struggles and triumphs, and lead to self-disclosure. • Group discussions weave couples together into supportive communities. • Information is provided in straightforward, clear language. • Exercises teach skills while deepening connections between partners. • Before every exercise couples use Emwave, biofeedback device that helps teach physiological self-soothing. • Show collage video. CTAV HAS FIVE CONTENT AREAS: 22 MODULES • Preserving Intimacy • Managing Conflict • Creating Shared Meaning • Managing Stress • Fathers, Marriage, and Parenting 

01:16:25
JULIE GOTTMAN So, aren't they wonderful? Weren't those couples unbelievable? They just gave so much, we have so much gratitude. So, in our groups, the group discussions would begin with one of those little clips. People would then talk with one another. Uhm, they would get, ah, five minutes with the emWave by HeartMath, do a little biofeedback then move in to an exercise. There were five content areas in our 22 weeks preserving intimacy, managing conflict, creating shared meaning, managing stress and fathers, marriage, and parenting. 

01:17:15
CTAV INTIMACY: CORE MODULES • Stay Close • Have Close Conversations • Express Needs • Turn Toward, Not Away • Magnify and Savor Positive Emotions • Building a Culture of Respect and Appreciation • Build Passion and Good Sex • Heal Old Wounds, including 1) Feeling Proud of Ourselves, and 2) I am my Family's Protector • Prevent and Recover from Infidelity 

01:17:20
JULIE GOTTMAN In intimacy, the modules included staying close, how to have close conversations, how to express your needs, how to turn towards not away from one another, how to really magnify and savor positive emotions, building a culture of respect and appreciation, building passion and good sex. And here were a couple of really important ones, healing old wounds which had to do with childhood, emotional injuries, traumas and feeling proud of ourselves that we survived our childhood that's what these couples were talking about with one another. One of the things that we've really understood though our couples research-- in therapy research is that just by learning how to manage conflict or, or to, ah, understand each other's regrettable incidents is not enough for couples. They need to really understand also the ways to turn towards one another, to express needs without hurting one another, to be able give appreciation, to look for what the partner is doing right not just what they're doing wrong. We also dealt with preventing as well as recovering from infidelity. 

01:18:50
EXAMPLE: HEAL OLD WOUNDS • One woman described to her partner her story from when she was 6-years old. • Drug-addicted and violent father cut hole in her bedroom window, caught and kidnapped her. • The woman's partner understood for first time why his partner was so controlling of him now she'd felt so out of control of her life back then. 

01:18:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Now, one of the examples, ah, the stories that came out of this study was for example one woman in the healing old wounds module had been very, very controlling of her partner and had drove her partner crazy, he really hated it. Well she told him the story in the healing old wounds module of how when she was 6 years old her parents had been divorced, her father was a drug addict and had come at night to her sliding glass door which was in her bedroom, used the glass cutter to cu-- to cut large hole in the glass. When inside, grabbed her, took her out, kidnapped her and took her away in a car to a long faraway distant place. It took her mother six months to track her down. So, you wanna talk about feeling out of control of your life? That's why she needed to have a sense of so much control. And when her partner heard that he was blown away, he'd never heard that story, they never talked about their past before. So his whole attitude about her need to have more control shifted in change with that exercise. 

01:20:25
EXAMPLE: PREVENT AND RECOVER FROM INFIDELITY • After this module, one gentleman reported he'd gone out with guy friends to a club. - In past, he might have messed around, which was their pattern. - This time in club, he broke out in cold sweat. He realized he needed to go home. - This wasn't the life he wanted anymore. - To group he said, I'm with her for life. If they're against that, they're against me, and I'll build a wall between them and my girl and me. 

01:20:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Another one was preventing and recovery from infidelity. And we had one guy who typically when out his guy friends to clubs where they would often pick up women, go screw the women, the he could come home with six o'clock in the morning that had been the pattern. It's kind of like battled bodies at war where the male partners were much closer to their male friends than their partners at home. Well this guy said that after this particular module, he had gone out with his guy friends, they started talking about picking up some cute babes in the club. He literally broke out into a cold sweat. He went outside, sat down on the curb, held his head, shook his head and realized he had to go home right now. He went back inside and he said to the group, "Look, I'm with her for life, if there against that-- if you're against that, you're against me and I'll build a wall between you and my girl and, and me." And the whole group just broke down into applause, it was really beautiful. 

01:21:50
CTAV MANAGING CONFLICT: CORE MODULES • Prevent Harmful Fights • Compromise • Self-Soothe, including Emwave Biofeedback Training • Manage Anger (Your Own and Others') • Have Recovery Conversations After A Fight • Know When Endless Fights Turn Harmful • Avoid And Heal Violence 1- Recognize when you are Heating Up • Avoid and Heal Violence 2 - Avoiding • Domestic Violence is Everyone's Responsibility 

01:21:50
JULIE GOTTMAN In our managing conflict modules, we have modules like preventing harmful fights, so to stay out of criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling which is what escalates fighting. We taught them a very cool method for compromise in which they first separate out some part of their position on an issue that they cannot compromise on. Then, they talk about what they're flexible about, and look for ways to honor each other's core need that they cannot compromise on by compromising within what is more flexible. Self-soothing, we did a particular module where we spent a lot of time with the emWave biofeedback even though they were using it before-- whenever he exercise and that was very cool. Really fun. We talked about managing anger, having recovery conversations after a fight. We talked about how to avoid violence by taking breaks in which they would tell their partner when they were coming back from the break. So their partner wouldn't feel abandoned and could let them go. And also how to recognize inside their body when they were heating up.

CTAV MANAGE CONFLICT (CONTINUED) • Know When Endless Fights Turn Harmful • Edit Out Negativity and Accept Influence SESSION EXAMPLE • In one group, couples focused on "Reaching your boiling point." A ritual for withdrawing from one another. • Jacobson & Gottman had reported that violent couples had no methods of withdrawing from one another as conflict escalated. • The next week, one couple reported that they'd had frequent PAST episodes of domestic violence. • This week they'd had another bad fight. - This time, however, husband locked himself in bathroom while his wife called a support worker. - Very proud that they'd avoided violence for 1st time. 

01:23:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Also we dealt with when endless fights turn harmful that again was related to domestic violence. And how to edit out negativity and to accept influence from one another. Uhm, okay, so in one of our modules, reaching the boiling point, there was one couple where the guy would just get triggered within half a second. Well, after reaching boiling point, preventing harmful fights module, he came back to the group next week and he reported that they had, had a bad fight but instead of him striking her, he had run to the bathroom, locked himself in while she called the facilitator and got support from the facilitator, he stayed in the bathroom until he calm down, then they came out together to talk. That was the first time in his life he'd avoided domestic violence. 

01:24:35
CTAV SHARED MEANING: CORE MODULES • Honor Your Partner's Dreams • Connect Emotionally - Create Rituals of Connection 

01:24:35
JULIE GOTTMAN In shared meaning, we deal with honoring your partners' dreams so what are the dreams of your partner? How many of you who have partners at home have asked your partner what are your dreams? It's an interesting question. A lot of us forget to ask and if we ask during romance in the beginning, we forget to ask 20 years down the road when we both changed. So these couples who didn't really even feel entitled to have dreams right? Because they were poor and the great American dream has crashed and burn to the ground. So they didn't know what each others' dreams were and in asking the questions of each other by gully, they discovered they had some which was really beautiful. Also we talked about creating rituals of connection, ways of connecting that people could count on with one another like, how do to reunite at the end of the day? Or how to say good morning in the beginning? How to go on a date once a week? How to maybe take an overnight? Something like that. So rituals of connection were a way that these couples could continue to build romance passion and good friendship in their relationships. 

01:26:10
CTAV MANAGE STRESS: CORE MODULE • Practice Self-Care - The Consequences of Triumphs and Setbacks • Have Stress-Reducing Conversations • Example: One woman confessed that she'd had thoughts of wanting to throw her baby against wall. She felt hopeless, ashamed and despairing. Because of trust in group, she told the group - PPD. Group empathized with her, immediately recognized she needed support. Now she is getting help and reports that these thoughts and impulses have subsided. 

01:26:10
JULIE GOTTMAN We also dealt with stress because these couples were under terrible stress, right? Often time their life had chaos, their lives out of their own control, they were under pretty brutal management, uhm, who would shift to hours all over the place on them. So we talked about self-care, we talked about feeling proud of themselves, how had they dealt with stress in the past and triumph? Feeling proud. We also gave them a tool called the stress reducing conversation, how they talk about what is stressing you out outside the relationship, with your partner so that you really feel close to your partner and not alone with that stress. That was a very important tool to give for example after that module, a woman came in saying she confessed that the earlier weekdays she'd had thoughts of throwing her baby against the wall when she heard the baby screaming. She felt hopeless, she felt ashamed, she felt horrible despair, and because of her trust in the group, she shared this with the group and with her partner in the group for the first time. And because she did that the whole group empathized with her and the facilitators were able to recognize that she was showing posttraumatic depression-- not posttraumatic sorry, postpartum depression and they got her help right away. 

01:28:00
FATHERS, MARRIAGE, AND PARENTING: CORE MODULES • Heal Old Wounds - I am my family's protector Example: Dads are reporting that they are loving being with their babies and with their babies' moms. They are proud of how different they are from their own dads. • Most have never had fathers in their lives. One father who had been incarcerated for 7 years before becoming a dad said, Being a husband and father gives me a reason to live. I never had one before now. • Stay Close - Taking time to know our partners and our children • Practice Emotion Coaching as parents 

01:28:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Fathers, marriage, and parenting we also had some core modules there having to do with healing old wounds, and that was so beautiful, this one guy who has was 26 years old, he'd already been incarcerated for seven years and had just gotten out. He talked about he had never, ever had a purpose for his own life until he looked into the eyes of his infant son, that gave him a reason to live. We talked about they stay close after a baby is born and also we really taught how fathers could connect with their babies by showing little films about how to recognize when your baby is over stimulated and needs to calm down, how to comfort a baby, that was really a lovely, uhm, time. Also we taught people emotion coaching which is a particular parenting that validates the emotions kids express without jumping in to trying to solve a problem or to teach right away, it's validation of emotion. 

01:29:25
TWO-STAGE SCREENING • Telephone screening instrument - shown to be effective. Female partner screened alone. • In home assessment before assignment people fill out the Personality Assessment Inventory measuring 11 DSM diagnoses. • The initial IPV scores for our sample were very low. • Screened out antisocial personality disorder. • Alcohol and drug problems were also screened out. • Safety continuously monitored throughout study, with referrals if needed. • Home visits at 4 time points as well. Checks self report about DV against interview. 

01:29:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay, uhm, I'll go back to John now and we'll talk about the results of this study, thank you. 

01:29:35
[sil.] 

01:29:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, so, ah, we're really nervous come here this morning, ah, because this is the first time we will presented these results, and, ah, and there, there are lots of people who really think a couples approach to domestic violence as immoral and you know, think it's an awful thing to do. So we wanna give you an idea of, of what these results are and what they mean. Now, uhm, one thing in the study that we included was long-term follow-up because there are very relapse rates in all of these kinds of intervention as you can see you know, there's tremendous comorbidity with addiction and incarceration, things like that in our population. So probably the most important kind of result and Julie was mentioning this is, we really wanna look at their physiology during relationship conflict, okay. 

01:30:35
RESULTS - THE COUPLES' RELATIONSHIP (SELF REPORTS) • Treatment couples showed significantly higher relationship satisfaction and lower conflict than control couples. • EFFECTS LASTED ON 18-month FOLLOW UP. • There were significant improvements in self-reports of Friendship and Shared Meaning for experimental couples, and through these a greater parenting alliance was created in the experimental group. 

01:30:35
JOHN GOTTMAN So we're in their homes doing these assessments and first of all, uhm, the treatment showed that we are created higher relationship satisfaction and less conflict so there was actually in the amount of conflict and higher relationship satisfaction. Now, that's probably the most measure in, ah, couples therapy and couples interventions. And these effects lasted on 18-month follow-up. In other words we basically have no relapse in this study which is really unheard of. I mean, Neil Jacobson's work, ah, for example, ah, reported 30 to 50% relapse in marital satisfaction after a two-year period. Not only were the significant improvements in relationship satisfaction and the amount of conflict but also in friendship and shared meaning and, and the way we measure that. And the parenting alliance, ah, that the couples had with their children. So that, that was the experimental group. 

01:31:40
RESULTS - PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL DURING CONFLICT DISCUSSIONS Males became more successful in their ability to physiologically self soothe during conflict discussions. WHILE, control group males showed significantly greater heart rate reactivity over time. RESULTS - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE • IPV was reduced over time in the treatment group, but only mediated through the increased use of relational skills, whereas no such changes occurred in control couples. • Couples who did not improve on the relationship skills did not change on IPV as a result of treatment. • Who were the couples who changed? 

01:31:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Now, the real are-- acid test here is what-- what's the nature of physiological arousal during the conflict discussions. And the answer is that particularly men became more successful in their ability to physiologically self-soothe during conflict discussions. So, ah, remember our basic assumptions are, we needed the two things, improve their social skills, right? Not just in conflict but also friendship and intimacy and shared meaning. While controlled couples actually showed greater heart rate reactivity overtime. So remember the control also situationally violent couple with no intervention, they get more physiologically arousal at time. Okay, now are-- what we found was that the self reports of it-- intimate partner violence were reduced overtime in the treatment group but only mediated through acquiring the relational skills. In other words, if the couple-- if a couple did not learn the socials skills, they did not change an intimate partner violence. Where there's no such changes occurred in the control group. So that's kind of interesting. Our-- so who, who are the couples who changed? Who are couples that learn the social skills? And-- so now we had to really go on to our data and see who are we not helping even though we gave an overall effect, all right in, in the data. 

01:33:15
SELF-REPORT ON IPV • Self report of IPV: No differences, but it was A FLOOR EFFECT BECAUSE • THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BASED ON POLICE RECORDS. WHO LEARNED THE SOCIAL SKILLS? WHO DIDN'T? • Analyses showed that all the effects of the intervention were mediated by the learning of the social skills. Who learned, who didn't? • ANSWER: INITIALLY, the couples who learned the social skills were: - MORE VIOLENT - MORE UNHAPPILY MARRIED - LOWER IN AFFECTION - MORE HOSTILE based on scored videos of conflict - Effects even stronger for men, which is very good. 

01:33:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Uhm, what about this measure of self report on intimate partner violence. And the answer is, well, first of all, uhm, there was kind of a floor effect cuz we really-- we don't have very serious domestic viol-- ah, serious domestic violence in this population to begin with. But we no-- then we looked at the police reports, and again there are significant differences. So far, more incidents of 911 calls with the police come for the control group compared to the experimental group. So there we see-- we really see the differences, but then we really wanna know well, who learned the social skills and who did learn them? And you know, how can we improve our intervention so that there are some people who really didn't get the social skills. So our subsequent analyses show that the people who learn the social skills were initially more violent, more unhappily married, lower in affection, more hostile on the videos of the conflicts, and these effects were even stronger for men which is also very good. So in other words, the couples who are most in need of the intervention at time one, the ones who looked the worst in their profile not only their behavior but their physiology, the amount of violence. Those were the ones who really got the intervention and had the effect on self report intimate partner violence as well as on the police reports. 

01:34:45
RESULTS ON HOSTILE BEHAVIOR OBSERVED DURING VIDEOTAPED CONFLICT - A VERY HARD MEASURE TO CHANGE SPAFF HOSTILITY SCORE = Contempt + Belligerence + Domineering + Anger + Defensiveness. MALE HOSTILE BEHAVIOR FEMALE HOSTILE BEHAVIOR 

01:34:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. Now, the other thing we looked at was, what about their behavior during conflict? How did they act when you had these videotapes scored by observers who did know about this being an experiment you know, ah, so the observers in the lab are just scoring videotapes all the time. They don't know if these people are on the experimental group or the control group. All right, they know we're doing the study. But-- so we create this hostility score which is the amount of contempt, belligerence, domineering, anger and defensiveness. And here's what we find, that overtime the green line which is the treatment group shows this steady decline until hostility is almost zero in that group. Whereas, the control group is going down temporarily but over this 18-month follow-up you can see that there-- you know, the overall trend is up for that group. And the same is true, this is male hostile behavior and we get pretty much the same pattern for women as well. In the experimental group, the green line is just going down so that at 18-month follow-up. So this 18 months after treatment is ended, there really is none of that, ah, arousal. So, uhm, in terms of hostile behavior. So we're getting effects you know, and this is very important because you can't this is self report data right? We're observing couples having conflict in their homes and we're looking at their heart rate at their blood velocity and at their behavior, and ever at 18-month follow-up they're staying calm during a conflict and they are less hostile. Okay, so that-- those, those effects worked. And the people who are worse often in the beginning are showing the biggest effects. 

01:36:40
LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY • Not all couples in the experimental group acquired the relationship & self-soothing skills. • Why didn't all couples acquire the skills? - Failure to complete more than 50% of sessions. • There is too much chaos in many lower-income couples' lives for them to attend 22 sessions. • Need court mandated treatment. • Need more group cohesion to hold couples. - Floor effect on IPV self-report measure. Our second study will have couples with more variability on IPV self reports. 

01:36:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay, well there are limitations in this study. So not all the couples in the experimental group acquired the relationships skills and the self-soothing skills. And you know, we don't why. I mean, we know that maybe they weren't as motivated cuz things learn as bad for those couples. Uhm, but we also know that not all the couples completed all the sessions. And so there was failure of some couples to complete more that 50% of the, of the sessions. There's a lot of reasons for that. One, you know, is there's a lot of chaos in lower-income couples world. Ah, the cars don't work as well, they-- you know, they lose their jobs, ah, and so-- you know, what would happen if we had court mandated treatment where-- you know, we were-- we had better attendance, or if we would increase group cohesion that would that would hold the couples better. 

01:37:30
WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO DO A SECOND STUDY • Based on these encouraging results, • With Julia Babcock, we are now going to test the effectiveness of CTAV on: - A more violent sample, - A court-mandated sample, - With higher amounts of domestic violence and emotional abuse - A randomized clinical trial CAN WE MAKE THE INTERVENTION SHORTER? 

01:37:30
JOHN GOTTMAN So now were in-- encouraged by these results to do a second study. And it's very important to replicate these findings make sure that you know, we really can do this. Can we extend it to a more violent sample, a court mandated sample with higher amounts of domestic violence and emotional abu-- abuse. Ah, and, and we're doing a randomized clinical trial in, in Oregon in a county in Oregon where the district attorney and the, and the presiding judge is really in favor of this kind of intervention which is very important because in a lot of places, you just can't do a couples intervention and agencies that deal with domestic violence will not agree to work with us because they don't believe there is such a thing as situational domestic violence. Can we make the intervention shorter? Well, okay, so let, let me tell you about a study that we did in just and just, just go through with this very quickly. 

01:38:25
THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE • These 4 behaviors predict divorce - CRITICISM - DEFENSIVENESS - CONTEMPT - STONEWALLING • They are also greater in DV couples, so these need to be reduced. • May be lead indicators of situational domestic violence RESULTS OF OUR 2-DAY WORKSHOP (NO DV) • In this study we dismantled our workshop using 4 groups • Improve Friendship & Intimacy - 1 day workshop (20 couples) • Eliminate Destructive Conflict- 1 day workshop (20 couples) • Do both - 2 day workshop (20 couples) • Bibliotherapy Control Group (20 couples) Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse by Intervention by Time 

01:38:25
JOHN GOTTMAN A very brief study are looking at, ah, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse that predict divorce, criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling. And these are also greater in domestically violent couples so they need to be reduced. And this maybe lead indicators of situational domestic violence. You know, this fights to go in control. So in, in a two-day workshop that we gave, this is no domestic violence but just looking at, ah, at the Four Horsemen. And we had four groups in this study, to-- one group will just try to improve friendship and intimacy. Another group working conflict and another group that did both. And then a control group that just got my book The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. And we found there, and looking at the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse the, ah, the interesting thing to look it-- look at it is again the green line which is the two- day workshop that works on conflict and friendship and intimacy. And this graph shows you know, and this pre, post and a year follow-up after treatment, after the tw0-day workshop. This is a very brief intervention, right. That in fact, you need to work on conflict and intimacy. You can't just work on conflict, right? You have to work on friendship and intimacy, emotional connection as well. 

01:39:40
Wives' Report of Gridlocked Conflict by Intervention by Time The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 2013 ANAHEIM 

01:39:45
JOHN GOTTMAN And, and this is true also in the wives' report of gridlock conflict that it's really that green line that looks the best overtime particularly on follow-up at the one year follow-up level. Uhm, and the same thing is true for husband he-- it's even bigger for the husbands and that green line really going down over post but staying down over one year follow-up. Okay, ah, now, I wanna stop here and just say so far what we know is that we can, we can intervene with this very, very difficult problem that Julia Babcock's meta-analysis has shown that there is not a single intervention that it doesn't deal with the couple relationship that actually works. And by a combination of teaching social skills not only conflict but in friendship and intimacy and shared meaning that we-- coupled with biofeedback that creates physiological self-soothing and taking breaks that we can change domestic violence, situational domestic violence and then say-- stays changed over an 18-month follow-up period. 

01:40:55
JULIE GOTTMAN So in con-- hmm, can you turn this on? So, in conclusion, uhm, again we wanna thank you for coming and for going back out again, ah, to work with this population that need your support, need your help, need your skill, need your compassion, ah, and need your dedication. So, thank you so very much and we will take questions now. Please come to the mike. 

01:41:35
[sil.] 

01:41:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes. 

01:41:40
UNKNOWN Hi. Uhm, I have, ah, question about something that you mentioned earlier in, in, in the discussion regarding, uhm, the receptiveness of domestic violent shelters and sort of the front line of triage, uhm, for these families. I worked in a, in indigent hospital in the OB clinic where we do-- this is the primary function of what we do. And most of our referrals of these families that we screen for services are to these shelters first, ah, because I can't afford other couples' therapy services. 

01:42:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:42:20
UNKNOWN And so, ah, I guess I'm looking for some, some input on how can maybe communicate, some of this to the shelters that we're working with, and maybe screen things differently in our interactions with these low-income families. 

01:42:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. You know, I would really recommend, ah, if possible, I mean, I know it's difficult but if possible to, ah, do some screening of the couples, uhm, to learn whether or not you have characterological domestic violence or situational domestic violence in front of you, uhm, because, ah, there are-- you know, it goes both directions. There are many partners who are not yet ready to leave their characterologically violent partners, uhm, who definitely need to be in the shelters. Uhm, there are others who are not in the characterologically violent relationships who aren't really sure what to do. They have situational DV, not characterological and... 

01:43:30
UNKNOWN And I would say that, that's the higher population of you were seeing - 

01:43:35
JULIE GOTTMAN The situational. 

01:43:35
UNKNOWN - the situational that's what we're seeing. 

01:43:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay, uhm, well if you do that screening, uhm, you know, all I can say is perhaps trying, ah, with situational DV to refer or at least to think about referring the couples to either a couples program which may not exist yet. Or, ah, to a very good couple's therapist who can teach them what, ah, and help support them in their work together. Okay. 

01:44:15
UNKNOWN Hi, thank you for the presentation. 

01:44:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:44:15
UNKNOWN Uhm, do you have effect size for the study that you recently produced? 

01:44:20
JOHN GOTTMAN I, I think it's about it .85. 

01:44:25
UNKNOWN Wow, that's great. 

01:44:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:44:25
UNKNOWN Uhm, my second question was, what did you do with the characterological couples that you screened out? 

01:44:35
JULIE GOTTMAN We, ah, referred the women, ah, we talked quite at length with the women and refer them to a, ah, domestic violence, uhm, ah, agency, ah, in the Seattle area. Yeah. 

01:44:55
UNKNOWN One final question. Is it possible to implement your program and how I would I go about doing that? 

01:45:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm, not quite yet. Uhm, what you can do is go to www.gottman.com that's G-O-T-T-M-A-N where at least, ah, the skills, the tools, etcetera many of those are already, ah, being used in couples therapy and are available to clinicians but we do not want to release this as a product until we've replicated the findings which we are now in the process of doing in Oregon. So stay tuned, because if those results prove to duplicate what we've already found, we will be creating this program releasing it and trying to get it out there. 

01:45:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:45:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, we're trying to be, ah, very careful you know, and not rut-- rush all these results have been published already, uhm, not the most late-- the latest analysis but, ah, they would be published as well and - 

01:46:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:46:05
JOHN GOTTMAN - so we're trying to be very cautious about this because, ah, a couples approach is so unpopular and even illegal in 31 states. 

01:46:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:46:15
JOHN GOTTMAN So we wanna really make sure that we've got something worth, ah, putting out there to the general clinical community before we do it. 

01:46:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Right, uh-hmm. 

01:46:25
UNKNOWN Going back to your description of the Pit Balls and the Cobras - 

01:46:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Yes. 

01:46:30
UNKNOWN - have you found that the diagnose similarly or that they have different DSM diagnosis typically. 

01:46:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, yes, there's a lot of speculation about that but the, uhm, the, the current belief you know, and replication studies and failures to replicate exactly that same, ah, classification is that the, the Pit Balls are borderline, and the Cobras are antisocial that... 

01:47:00
UNKNOWN That's, that's about what I would have expected thank you so much. 

01:47:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Right, exactly, exactly. 

01:47:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm. Tilth(ph). 

01:47:05
TILTH Wow. 

01:47:05
JULIE GOTTMAN This is Tilth(ph), he's wonderful. 

01:47:05
TILTH My goodness. You guys, we gotta talk. This is great. Uhm, - 

01:47:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Thanks. 

01:47:10
TILTH - you, you actually answered the question accidentally for me. I had a couple I was working with and, ah, when I sat down with them during the conflict conversation it was like quiet for a minute. You know, this nice, old, easy conversation, it was like quite for a minute. She turns to him and says, "Why the hell." And next thing I knew they were off to the racist in this conflict that I almost like, "Oh, my god." You know, I wanted to-- I, I wanted to stop and I probably did just say, "Gosh, she gotta stop." It just has to stop. I can't have you doing that in this office. It sounds like they are the second time, they're not the characterological I don't think. I was kind of like, this is a Pit Ball it is-- cuz they both, they both get it. 

01:47:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:47:50
TILTH And I was just tota-- so thank you for answering that question. I've been wondering it for years, what was that about and that answer the question. I wanted to know what county if you can tell me. 

01:48:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Ah, uhm, it's, it's, uhm, I don't know the county but it's Newberg I believe. 

01:48:10
TILTH Okay, got it. 

01:48:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Newberg, Oregon. 

01:48:15
TILTH Thank you, I know what it is. 

01:48:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes. 

01:48:15
JOHN GOTTMAN You know what it is, 0kay, great. 

01:48:15
TILTH Thank you. 

01:48:15
JULIE GOTTMAN You're welcome. Uhm, sir. 

01:48:20
UNKNOWN Hi, there. What are your thoughts towards trying to salvage, uhm, marriage with an incarcerated, uhm, spouse who was incarcerated because he was in an abusive relationship or-- I'm sorry, that spouse was abusive. And do you believe that there is maybe an alternative treatment then what is typical for that incarcerated member? 

01:48:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm, okay. So the, the thing that's difficult to know, ah, in terms of working on a relationship where one partner has been incarcerated for the violence, uhm, is whether or not that's a characterological, ah, violent partner or not. So I would not do, ah, encouragement of couples work, uhm, unless you knew for a fact that, that person, uhm, was indeed only situational domestic violence and not characterological. 

01:49:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, we-- we're starting to work with the characterologically domestically violent couples as well, ah, with Julia Babcock and she has actually done a brief intervention using some, some of our techniques for editing out negativity and accepting influence, those two skills, just two skills. And the conversation is changed so we get proximal change in the characterologically violent guys. But we don't know you know, whether that will take and it's almost impossible to get funding in this area by an-- from the National Institute of Mental Health right now. 

01:49:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:49:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:49:50
UNKNOWN Hi, that was phenomenal, I really saw that was-- your work is amazing and it really made the conference light up for me. 

01:50:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhm. 

01:50:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Thanks. 

01:50:00
UNKNOWN I wanted to say, uhm, what do you do-- I noticed the couple, ah, that one couple at the end when they were talking about infidelity, uhm, it was Rachael Campbell(ph) and he say-- he reached over and he said, "I do so much for you after I had the affair and it's not enough." Which I thought of his hopelessness and then lack of forgiveness and I've seen that with couples and I wonder how you would address that. 

01:50:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. Uhm, we talked about that, ah, during our infidelity, ah, workshop, uhm, exactly how to address that. Uhm, so you can see that on the, ah, evolution of psychotherapy website slides but very briefly. What I can say is that, uhm, there are phases that the couple needs to go through in order to heal. Uhm, and first is where she ask him a lot of questions. Ah, he answers them honestly and truthfully. He expresses tons and tons of remorse. Ah, and, uhm, it may take her a very long time to rebuild trust. He needs to really be able to hear her pain, empathize with her pain, validate her pain, uhm, before apologizing. 

01:51:30
JOHN GOTTMAN And that's the attunement phase. 

01:51:30
JULIE GOTTMAN That's attunement. 

01:51:30
JOHN GOTTMAN And then there's two other phases, attunement and attachment. 

01:51:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Right, so if you just go, ah, to the slides on that website I think, uhm, perhaps that will help further answer the question for you. 

01:51:45
UNKNOWN Great, and then the other question I had was, as these couples get more intimate, don't they try to socialize outside the group? And then you know, there's a lot of talk outside the group and how do you bring them back just to the group so that you know, to relax...

JULIE GOTTMAN We don't so-- we don't have the s-- ah, a ground rule as is true for classic groups psychotherapy that there's no socializing outside of group. Uhm, because this is not classic group psychotherapy. This is a different model. So, uhm, we neither encourage or discourage, ah, couples to do that. Uhm, most of these couples, uhm, in the study at least didn't really do that because they were coming from all different parts of, ah, a very large metropolitan area. They didn't have the money to transport themselves, ah, to each other's homes and so on. So that didn't really happen. Uh-hmm, yes. 

01:52:50
UNKNOWN Hi, I had a question about characterological, uhm, violence. 

01:52:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Could you speak right into the mike? 

01:52:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I can make it taller. Uhm. 

01:52:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Thank you. 

01:52:55
UNKNOWN So I had a question about, ah, women in particular. I have most of my experiences at woman who had been in multiple characterologically violent relationships. And so I know you said that you're for a lot of them out, but I was wondering if you had ideas on how-- what, what you can do to work them or resources, uhm, I don't know, if you happen to one of people that's working with those women or, or men. 

01:53:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Sure, uhm, though I don't have them at the top of my head, but, uhm, I have also worked, ah, quite a bit with women who have multiple characterologically violent relationships. Uhm, and there is lots and lots of PTSD that you have to address in therapy. Uhm, you have to, ah, make sure that they are safe. Uhm, they may need if they're in a relationship now, they may need a safety plan to leave and, ah, let see, where we include it-- we've got you know, I mean, most agencies have safety plan, ah, designs to help, ah, a woman prepare to live in a way that will keep her and her children also safe. Uhm, there are domestic violence hotline numbers, there's a national one, also there is one in every state, ah, that usually is, ah, a crisic-- ah, sorry crisis clinic hotline number. So, those you know-- both the national-- ah, if you just Google domestic violence hotline, uhm, you can both national phone numbers to refer your women to or within your state as well. 

01:54:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Tell her that, ah, reports study, ah, study that appeared in more magazine but health so that-- so there is, ah, ah, these women are also at risk for, ah, lifelong serious health problems and you can read about it in the current issue of a magazine called More, M-O-R-E. 

01:55:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, okay. 

01:55:05
UNKNOWN Hi, uhm, sorry, I'm little nervous, ah. 

01:55:10
JULIE GOTTMAN That's okay. 

01:55:10
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

01:55:10
JULIE GOTTMAN We love you. 

01:55:15
UNKNOWN Uhm, I come from Ecuador and sadly over there domestic violence is a big problem and it also come imbedded with, ah, lots of alcoholism - 

01:55:20
JOHN GOTTMAN All right. 

01:55:20
UNKNOWN - and that's imbedded within our culture. Uhm, so my question is-- ah, also we have like usually families have lots of kids over there so it's like - 

01:55:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:55:30
UNKNOWN - families of eight, or nine people. 

01:55:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:55:35
UNKNOWN Uhm, my question is, you have in culture, ah, like having violence being such a huge part of our culture in a certain way and alcoholism. How would you deal with that huge factor that influences, uhm, these actions that families have especially men within our families? 

01:55:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Hmm, uhm, are you talking about that huge factor being the violence, the alcoholism or both? 

01:56:00
UNKNOWN The culture of violence and alcoholism. 

01:56:00
JULIE GOTTMAN The culture, okay. 

01:56:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:56:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay, very good. Uhm, that's, that's really a great question. We have also done a lot of work in other countries such as Turkey for example where there is terrible domestic violence too and it's-- ah, and alcohol. Ah, and, ah, it is very accepted in the culture. Uhm, they have three times the amount of DV that we have in the states. So you know, I think the thing that, uhm, really needs to happen is that women, uhm, need to be empowered to understand that they do not have to take abuse. And the thing that is really a challenge I think at least what we've seen is that, uhm, the mothers of the women who are getting abuse send them back to the partners because they too have been abused, it's multigenerational - 

01:57:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:57:05
JULIE GOTTMAN - and they will you have to go back, you've gotta preserve your marriage no matter what. And that is so-- dead wrong. So I think there needs to be information through the media, through, ah, journal articles, newspaper articles on the websites and so on about the after effects of women experiencing domestic violence in terms of terrible chronic health problems even after they leave the relationship, the terrible distress it causes the children not only on an emotional level but a physical illness level as well because their bodies are full of stress hormones from witnessing the violence etcetera. So we have to talk about the penalties, the consequences of domestic violence, get that out there in public, uhm, before there can be cultural change. And I think it's time to stop, thank you so very much everyone, thank you. 

01:58:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Yup, thank you.
