The Skill-ionaire in EVERY Child Boosting Children's Socio-Emotional Skills Using the Latest in Brain Research Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hi, I'm Marie-Nathalie Beaudoin and I'm delighted for this opportunity to share with you ways to bring forth the Skill-ionaire in every person. There has been so many discoveries in brain research in neurobiology the last few years that we now have more information on the key transformative factors that really enrich encoding in the brain. So today in this video, I will briefly review some of these transformative factors and then share with you a map that can guide conversations as we discuss social and emotional experiences of our clients. This map is only a suggestion of different territories that can be helpful to explore and it often helps clients better connect with their skills and be more able to use them at will in their own lives.

Discussion 

00:01:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN I will start with a description of some of the brain research findings on key transformative factors and their implications when we are examining some problems. Then I will share a socio-emotional skills map that can guide us in transformative conversation and give us territories that are helpful to examine. This will be followed by a demonstration of this process in my first meeting with a child and her mother, and separately with an adult. Our video will conclude with a brief commentary on this interview process. 

00:02:10
The brain can be physiologically changed by experience. What type of experience is necessary? Which aspects of experience are most transformative? 

00:02:10
Research is increasingly revealing the ideal conditions under which the brain changes. Some of the key factors include: 1. Attention (novelty) 2. Meaning 3. Affect 

00:02:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So if the brain can be physiologically changed by experience, you may wonder what type of experience is necessary, which aspect of experience are most transformative. Research is increasingly revealing the ideal conditions under which the brain changes. Some of the key factors include attention, which you can also think of as novelty, meaning and affect. If we take them one by one, let's start with attention. 

00:02:45
*Brain is always scanning the environment *When it finds something new and interesting, there is a burst of adrenaline and a focus of attention 

00:02:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The brain is always scanning the environment and when it finds something new and interesting, there is a burst of adrenaline and a focus of attention. When you think about it, this process makes complete sense from a survival standpoint. It's like having a mental guard, like a neural network alarm that's ready to focus on it--our attention on the slightest new stimulus which could potentially be dangerous. 

00:03:15
*Attention is critical for the brain to encode information in a usable way *Attention span for adults and children varies greatly whereas children's keen attention is assumed to last the equivalent of age in minutes. 

00:03:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Attention is also critical for the brain to actually encode information in a usable way. For example, people don't remember the names of others being introduced to them unless they pay attention. It's interesting to note that attention span for adults and children vary greater, whereas children's keen attention is assumed to last the equivalent of their age in minutes, while for adults they can last longer but this, of course, is affected by fatigue, nutrition and emotion. This gives us an idea that important conversations with children do not benefit from being longer time wise, that children will remember more of what we talk about if we keep our questions and our process a little shorter. 

00:04:05
Meaning *Ascribing meaning is the process by which people make deep connections either relevant to them personally or linking prior knowledge to new experiences *Events that are meaningful and connected affectively to one's own unique life experience are stored in long term and autobiographical memory 

00:04:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ascribing meaning is the process by which people make deep connections either profoundly relevant to them personally or linking prior knowledge with new experiences. Events are meaningful and connected affectively to one's own unique life experience are stored in long-term and autobiographical memory. 

00:04:35
Affect Affective reactions influence the quality and intensity of neural encoding: --Comfortable ("positive")affect is associated with more complex levels of processing -Uncomfortable ("negative") affective is associated with faster and more intense levels of processing 

00:04:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Now if we look at our third transformative factor, affect, well in most of the brain research in neurobiology literature, affect is often divided into positive and negative affect. I personally think that all forms of emotions and affective reactions can be helpful. If you're in anger, for example, can protect us from great dangers. However, when studying the brain, very different areas and structures are involved whether a person is experiencing emotions falling in the positive spectrum or the negative spectrum. So for a lack of a better word, I will also use this vocabulary. So if we look at affect, affective reactions influence the quality and intensity of neural encoding. This is really important because positive affect is associated with more complex levels of processing, while uncomfortable negative affect is associated with faster and more reactive levels of processing. Let me say more about this. 

00:05:45
Intense negative emotions *Narrow attention on arousing detail *Reduce memory of peripheral info *Increase cortisol production *Engage of fight/flight/freeze system *Diminish the ability to connect *Reduced blood flow to the self-control and thinking part of the brain 

00:05:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So intense negative emotions reduce blood flow to the self-control and thinking part of the brain. This is quite important so let me show you an illustration from my upcoming book. 

00:05:55
Brain Response (Beaudoin, in press) Sorting If danger Stimulus quicker Response Limbic system: Reacting 

00:06:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you can start here at the bottom left of the illustration and see that a stimulus is coming in as information to the brain. Say the person is noticing a face or hearing a word. If it's a dangerous information, it will be sent through a short route for a quick response. As you can tell, the stimulus will go directly through the limbic system. The person will react very quickly and engage into a response. 

00:06:30
Brain Response Prefrontal cortex: Thinking Sorting Stimulus If danger quicker Response Limbic System: Reacting Stimulus If safe slower Response 

00:06:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN However, if the information is perceived as safe, as you can see in the next illustration, the information will also travel to the prefrontal cortex, which is the thinking area of the brain. The information will be analyzed. There might be some reasoning, some thinking, even comparing with previous experience, connecting with some memories from the hippocampus and then the plan for a response will be made. This process is slower but it can regulate the limbic temptation to react, as shown by the middle arrow in this figure. And the prefrontal cortex can determine a possibly more appropriate response. 

00:07:20
In other words, physiologically speaking The more intense the fear or anger the less able to think 

00:07:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN In other words, physiologically speaking, the more intense the fear or anger, the less able to think or more negative affect, less thinking. 

00:07:35
Affect * Emotional reactions also affect the retrieval of memories i.e., mood congruent recall *The key structures responsible for long term memories are located in the "emotional part" of the brain 

00:07:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN As you can tell, affect plays a critical role in the brain's information processing system. And there's more. Emotional reactions also affect the retrieval of memories. It's a process called mood congruent recall. So, for example, when somebody is sad, they tend to remember sad events. When feeling competent, they'll more easily remember other moments of competency. This is especially true since the key structures responsible for long-term memories are located in the emotional part of the brain. 

00:08:10
Repetition? While repetition is often considered a learning enhancer in school, its efficacy with life skills varies. Sometimes it helps, especially if there is some elaboration, sometimes it doesn't. It depends on the presence of the other three key factors . . . . 

00:08:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN You may wonder about repetition. I've mentioned three key transformative factors and oftentimes in school and in much of children's education, repetition is considered a learning enhancer. Repetition is sometimes helpful and sometimes it's not. It really depends on the presence of the other key factors. Some of you how are parents may have noticed that there are certain things that your child will remember even if you mention it just one time while there is other things that you may need to repeat over and over and over again and they still don't remember it. So repetition alone is not enough. 

00:08:50
Is it even possible to discuss problem related material in a way that makes it exciting to a person, relevant to their experiences and triggers positive affect? YES! 

00:08:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Moving to our next section, you may wonder is it even possible to discuss problem related material in a way that makes it exciting, relevant and triggers positive affect? Well I'm happy to say that yes, it is possible. 

00:09:10
It is possible! *Instead of dwelling on times when a person was impatient, you can instead focus extensively on times when he or she experienced the temptation to be patient *You can BOOST the desired skill 

00:09:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Instead of dwelling on times when a person was impatient, for example, you can instead focus extensively on times when he or she experienced the temptation to be patient. You can boost or enhance the desired skill. That's because if you yell in impatience at someone, it doesn't mean that you don't know how to be patient. A problem doesn't mean a lack of skills. 

00:09:40
A problem doesn't mean a lack of skills Patience Trigger 

00:09:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN As you can see from the illustration here, we can see problems in some ways as being a highway in the brain, a neural network that goes very fast and that provides response very quickly but that is not associated with much thinking. Their probably of being used and their speed of activation is higher than other neural networks but other neural networks coexist. The patient's neural network, illustrated by a dotted line here, coexists. It just hasn't been used enough or it just hasn't been used in this specific context to fire loudly enough in the brain for the brain to respond in that particular way. 

00:10:25
How can we access preexisting neural networks for skills? By exploring successes i.e. Performance of skills 

00:10:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So how can we access preexisting neural networks for skills? Well by exploring successes or performances of skills or a near performance of skills. 

00:10:40
In a brain activity way 

00:10:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And that, in a brain activating way. Let me define a success. 

00:10:45
Defining a success *An experience of maintaining integrity in the face of a potential challenge; *The performance of an emerging, unnoticed or taken for granted, skill; Occurs when people have experienced temptations, desires or needs that could have resulted in unpleasant outcomes but haven't or have in a controlled way 

00:10:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN A success is an experience of maintaining integrity in the face of a potential challenge. It's the performance of an emerging and unnoticed or taken-for-granted skill. It occurs when people have experienced temptations, or desires or needs that could have resulted in unpleasant outcomes but haven't or have in a controlled way. 

00:11:10
Factors to consider in a success 1. outcome: -problem solved -problem not solved 2. Process: -constructive -mix between constructive and not -mostly destructive 

00:11:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Now there's a couple of factors to consider when determining or choosing a success. There's first the outcome, is the problem solved or is the problem not solved. But second, there's also the process. Most of the time, we tend to focus only on the outcome, especially if we're talking with children. But in reality, the internal process that goes on in somebody's mind, a process that's invisible, can be more important to examine. The process that goes on in a person's mind can be constructive. It can be a mix between constructive and not constructive or it can be mostly destructive, although I have to say that I have yet to meet a person who only has destructive thoughts in their mind. Most people end up having a mix of constructive thoughts and not so constructive thoughts all being experienced at once when they're facing a stressful or difficult situation. 

00:12:15
PROBLEM There are 6 types of success: 1. Outcome: problem Solved Process: Constructive 2. Outcome: Problem Solved Process: Temptation to do something unhelpful was contained 3. Outcome: Problem Solved Process: Messy, engaged in both helpful and unhelpful responses. 4. Outcome: Problem Not Solved Process: Messy, engaged in both helpful and unhelpful responses 5. Outcome: Problem Not Solved Process: Solution ideas occurred but not attempted 6. Outcome: Problem Not Solved Process: No visible sign of helpful thought 

00:12:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN There's six types of success if you combine these two categories of outcome and process. 

00:12:25
2. Outcome: Problem Solved Process: Temptation to do something unhelpful was contained 3. Outcome: Problem Solved Process: Messy, engaged in both helpful and unhelpful responses. 

00:12:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN But the two that we're most interested in today are number two and number three, when the problems are solved but there was a temptation to do something unhelpful, and number three, when the problem is solved and the process was messy and the person engaged in both helpful and unhelpful responses. 

00:12:45
Example Johnny is easily taken over by frustration and has a habit of impulsively yelling insults, commonly called "bad words": *This could be a child at school, *Or an adult annoyed by neighbors' frequent loud music. 

00:12:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN For example, Johnny is easily taken over by frustration and has a habit of impulsively yelling insults. It could be a child or this could an adult. 

00:13:00
Historically, We've tried to help people with such struggles by: *trying to teach new skills *offering anger management *examining their problematic emotional reaction *analyzing their thought pattern *offering ways to remember coping strategies 

00:13:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Historically, help professionals, educators and even parents try to help people with such struggles by trying to teach new skills or offer anger management training, or examine their problematic emotional reaction, or analyzing their thought patterns or even offering ways to remember coping strategies. 

00:13:20
The more intense the neural signal to respond in the habitual problem way, the less effective an external control, or post-it-like reminder Problem Trigger Stay Calm 

00:13:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN When you think about it, the more intense the internal biochemical signal telling the brain to respond in a problem way, the less likely an external control, such as another person or a lesson will help contain that. 

00:13:45
The pre-existing network alternative *Asking several questions about how a person controls, stops, or self-regulate a very specific instance of a problem experience, *Can allow us to tap into those pre-existing neural network which already attempt to control the problem 

00:13:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Using preexisting neural network builds on what's already in the brain. You could ask several questions about how a person controls, stops, or self-regulate a very specific instance of a problem experience. This can allow us to tap into those pre-existing neural network which are already attempting to control the problem so you're building on what's already there in the brain. You're getting a head start. 

00:14:15
In our examples *With the child, asking about the 2nd or 3rd "bad words" which were not said, would be more helpful than asking about those said; *With the adult, asking carefully crafted questions about how he eventually stopped himself would tap into his very own arguments for self-control and strengthen these underlying neural network 

00:14:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN In our example, with the child, you could be asking about the second or the third bad word which was not said, and that may be more helpful than asking about those said. 

00:14:25
I heard that, you are benched for the rest of recess. You're . . . stupid! 

00:14:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN With the adult, you could ask a number of carefully crafted questions about how he eventually stopped himself and that would tap into his very own arguments for self-control and strengthen these underlying neural networks. 

00:14:45
What are the effects of simply "boosting" existing skills and knowledges? From a neuroscience point of view, there are dramatic differences between skill boosting and skill teaching; Let's examine the effects of this switch in perspective, in particular with children 

00:14:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So what are the effects of simply boosting or enhancing existing skills and knowledges? Well, from a neuroscience point of view, there are dramatic differences between skill boosting and skill teaching. Let's examine the effects of this switch in perspective. 

00:15:05
(chart) 

00:15:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Let's look at this chart and use the example of a person struggling with a bad word habit. If you think of what becomes more articulated, if you focus on the bad words that were not said or how the person stopped themselves, then the conversation will dwell and enhance and articulate the helpful skills. If you focus on why the person is saying the bad words, then you may inadvertently reinforce the problem. When you focus on how the person stops themselves, the person becomes knowledgeable and their type of knowledge is experiential. Their level of participation can be great, especially children who don't like to talk about behaviors that they engaged in that was problematic. The focus becomes on assets and the content is on the invisible thought process. In contrast, if you focus on the problem, if you focus on the habit of saying bad words, then oftentimes the adult with a child or the interviewer with a client becomes a little more knowledgeable. The knowledge is intellectual and the person can become more or less passive or defensive because the focus is on deficits. When we focus on successes, conversational possibilities are great. They're rich with unexpected details being added. This is often a new territory to explore. While when we focus on problem, the conversation can be limited in scope by what was noticed externally about the problem. The brain relevance when we focus on skills is great because we're developing existing neural patterns of interaction in powerful ways. While if we're trying to teach a new skills, then it requires working to create a new neural network. Also, the connection to life experience is maximized, as the incident is relevant to personal life when we're talking about skills, while the connection to life experience can be minimal to moderate if the discussion is about teaching skills. Emotions are also positive when we're focusing on skills and successes and it maximizes the encoding in the brain, while we focus on the problem, then the emotions can become negative or neutral at best. 

00:17:45
(chart) 

00:17:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Conversations focusing on skill increase people's ability to take responsibility for their pro--problems and feel response-able, that is, capable of acting in a way that will minimize the problems. People can also feel more committed to using their strategies because it's their own ideas and they came up with it. They're also more able to notice the consequences of their choices and spend more time in self-reflection wondering about how they did that. Their empathy and awareness of other's feelings can also be heightened because they don't need to be defensive. They can more readily notice what's happening about other people. Conversations focusing on problem can be helpful sometimes for sure. But too much of them can leave people feeling stuck or powerless in their problems. It can leave people feeling less able to respond and with children, it can leave them needing to hide their mistakes or defend themselves. Bringing forth people's own belief and knowledges and ideas about how to handle their negative emotions is important. In some way, the mind that generates the poison is the best to generate it's antidote. I am reminded here of an example in my book where a young boy struggled with a nightmare and I invited him to put words to a part of him that knew he was safe. The nightmare was illogical and so the brain that generated the problem arguments was really the best brain to generate the solution arguments. So let's look at the socioemotional skills map that I have designed to guide some of my conversation with people. The ideas in this map are inspired by the work of Michael White and David Epstein and many other narrative therapists. They're also inspired by research on social and emotional intelligence, neurobiology, by my experience of working with children, families and schools and also by Buddhist psychology. 

00:20:00
Skill Boosting Map 1. Awareness of intentions 2. Observations about the other person 3. Connection to known preferred identity 4. Anticipated effects 

00:20:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So the four categories or the four territories that I like to explore with people struggling with relationship skills are first their awareness of their intentions. It's often an awareness of a goal or shrinking problem or keeping problems small. The second territory is their observations about the other person and that would include the visible and invisible aspects of the other person. The third territory is how people are connecting to their known preferred identity or the kind of person they like to be. And the fourth category are the anticipated effects or the rippling effects. Let me take these one by one. First, the intentions. 

00:20:55
1. Intentions When people realize they are facing a tricky situation, they usually experience a "secret hope" which can be identified in their: *intention *initial thinking *wish, inclination *desire to avoid a specific outcome 

00:20:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN When people realize they are facing a tricky situation, they usually experience a secret hope, which can be identified in their intention, their initial thinking, their wish, their inclination, or their desire to avoid a specific outcome. It's often really helpful to put words to that because it's the beginning of the sequence of reactions and efforts and behaviors and emotional experiences that sets the stage for everything that follows. 

00:21:25
2. Awareness of Others *When people attempt to steer an interaction in a certain direction, they often have a certain perception of the other person involved. *Putting words to this burgeoning and unarticulated awareness of others can significantly contribute to developing greater perspective and compassion 

00:21:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN The second category, awareness of others, is important to examine as well because when people attempt to steer an interaction in a certain direction, they often have a certain perception of the other person involved. Putting words to this burgeoning and unarticulated awareness of others can significantly contribute to developing greater perspective and compassion. I like to think of this awareness of others as having two different components: components that are visible and components that are invisible. The visible components are what you see about a person's face or their body or what you're noticing. The invisible aspects are different factors that may have shaped their lives or contributed to their behaviors in some ways. 

00:22:20
Double vision: Considering visible & "invisible" information Example: The "visible" may be the yelling of a word 

00:22:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Looking at invisibles can make an immense difference in how we're going to respond to a situation. If we take our bad word example, say somebody says a mean word to a child. If the child only hears and sees the mean word, the child will be tempted to react in an angry way. 

00:22:40
Double vision: Considering visible & "invisible" information Considering only "visible information can feel hurtful 

00:22:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN However, if the child is able to keep in mind some invisible factors shaping the life of the other person, then they might be able to respond very differently. Say for example, the other person's dog died yesterday. Knowing all of these things about another person's life will modulate how you respond to them. It might soften how you respond to them. 

00:23:10
Double vision: Considering visible & "invisible" info can change one's experience Invisibles: Personal Contextual Relational Historical Situation Past Present 

00:23:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN In my work with people, I have noticed that there are different kinds of invisible and those don't need to be remembered or even mentioned to our clients but it's nice to, to keep in mind that there are invisibles that have to do with personal information, contextual information, relational experiences, historical events or that are situational like being hungry right now. 

00:23:35
3. Preferred Identity Most young people and many adults have no idea who they became when they navigated a tricky situation. It is helpful to name their self-knowledge: *What was important for them? *Which experience of themselves dominated? *Did they value responding to the event in such a problem minimizing way? 

00:23:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Third, the preferred identity. Most young people and many adults have no idea who they became when they navigated a tricky situation. It is helpful to name their self-knowledge. What was important for them? Which experience of themselves dominated? Did they value responding to the event in such a problem-minimizing way? 

00:24:00
4. Rippling Effects *The solving of a tricky situation changes the course of one's day in many ways. * Helping people articulate the implications of their choices contributes to developing a habit of thinking about consequences *Effects to examine: relationships, feelings about oneself, trouble, fun, etc. 

00:24:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And our last category is the rippling effects. The solving of a tricky situation changes the course of one's day in many, many ways. Helping people articulate the implications of their choices contributes to developing a habit of thinking about consequences. Oftentimes, children are accused of not thinking about consequences. In my work with young people, I've noticed that if we talk about a success, if we keep their affect within the positive spectrum, then children are well able to think about the consequences and notice what followed their response. If we get children to be defensive, however, and angry, then they're less likely to be able to think about all of these categories. Helpful effects to examine are effects on relationships, such as, you know, family members or parents or peers or colleagues if it's an adult, feelings about oneself, the amount of trouble or conflict that one got into, the amount of fun, the amount of time a certain task took. 

00:25:15
The airplane metaphor Others Luggage Intentions Self 

00:25:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Oftentimes at the end of a session, I like to tie all of the material and the territories that I examined with a client in a summary. And even find a metaphor or illustration that will help them remember the categories we talked about. A common metaphor that people use is the airplane metaphor or a bird metaphor. I might even bring it up for children because children tend to really like this idea. And I usually draw it on paper for people and I put the nose--in the nose of the plane I put the intentions, which is often to shrink problems, and then the two wings of the plane are thinking about others and thinking about yourself and in the tail of the plane contains the luggage and it represents the effects that you will be carrying with you for the rest of the day. I will now demonstrate this map in my first meeting. 

00:26:15
The following interviews are non-scripted and reflect the unexpected process which unfolds in many interviews Only excerpts relevant to this video are shown.

Meeting the person and understanding the bullying problem 

00:26:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Well hi Mackenzie and, ah, Catherine. So before we start, I always like to ask people what they like to do for fun and, and, you know, how you spend your time and what you do when you're not at school. So which one of you would like to start? 

00:26:50
MACKENZIE Uhm, I'll go first. 

00:26:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? 

00:26:50
MACKENZIE Uhm, I play softball with my friends in my free time. 

00:26:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:26:55
MACKENZIE And I play beach volleyball with my, ah, my friends too. 

00:27:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:27:00
MACKENZIE We go to Santa Cruz. 

00:27:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Ah, nice. So you go to Santa Cruz and play beach ball, volleyball? 

00:27:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:27:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN That's really nice. 

00:27:10
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:27:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And how about you? 

00:27:10
CATHERINE Well I'm the loud cheerleader always at her games because I'm very athletic too. 

00:27:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:27:20
CATHERINE And after, after some sports, we love to go out and eat and shop and spend time together. So that's what I love to do. 

00:27:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. That's great. So do you get to have a lot of free time to spend together? 

00:27:30
CATHERINE Ah, mostly so. I try, try my best. I love her, so.

MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:28:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . that you all like? 

00:28:30
MACKENZIE Mother's not so happy when we play with it in house though. 

00:28:35
CATHERINE No. Do not knock anything over. 

00:28:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN You know, that's really true when there is a ball bouncing around. Okay, so can you tell me a little bit more about what brings you here today? 

00:28:45
CATHERINE Well we're starting a new school here, which we're very excited about. 

00:28:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:28:50
CATHERINE But the previous year was a little hard. Uhm, she's been facing some bullying from one girl in particular and she doesn't really know how to stand up for herself. And she's such a kind person . . . 

00:29:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:29:00
CATHERINE . . . I don't want people to take advantage of that. 

00:29:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:29:05
CATHERINE So just ways on how to improve the situation. 

00:29:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. How to improve this bullying. 

00:29:10
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:29:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And respond to these bullying situations. Yeah. How about for you? 

00:29:15
MACKENZIE Well there is a girl and her name is Alex. And she does bully me a lot. And it hurts my feelings. 

00:29:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN What kind of bullying does she do? Is it more physical bullying or verbal bullying or . . . 

00:29:30
MACKENZIE Both. 

00:29:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Both. 

00:29:30
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:29:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So she says mean things sometimes? 

00:29:35
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:29:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And then she hurts you physically too? 

00:29:35
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:29:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN What might she do physically? 

00:29:40
MACKENZIE Well sometimes she trips me and I get blood and she just runs away or she, uhm, like pushes me to the floor . . . 

00:29:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:29:50
MACKENZIE . . . and kind of just laughs. 

00:29:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:29:55
MACKENZIE So. And then like verbally she'll call names and embarrass me. 

00:30:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And how does that affect you when, ah, this girl is pushing you and calling you names and all that? How does that leave you feeling inside? 

00:30:10
MACKENZIE Uhm, it kind of makes me feel unwanted. 

00:30:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:30:15
MACKENZIE From her especially. 

00:30:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And does it affect your other relationships with your friends and the other people in your class? 

00:30:20
MACKENZIE Uhm, not really. 

00:30:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Now, uhm, the bullying incidents, are they always with Alex or do they involve other people? 

00:30:30
MACKENZIE Uhm, sometimes it's other people. 

00:30:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:30:35
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:30:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So the other people, are they friends of Alex? 

00:30:35
MACKENZIE Uhm, no. They're on and off friends me. 

00:30:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So they're on and off friends with you and sometimes Alex able to kind of recruit them into the bullying. 

00:30:50
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:30:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. And has this been happening for a long time? 

00:30:55
MACKENZIE Uhm, yeah. 

00:30:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. You've known her for a while? 

00:30:55
MACKENZIE Yeah. I've known her since first grade. 

00:31:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:31:00
CATHERINE And they were friends before so I, I'm not quite sure . . . 

00:31:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:31:05
CATHERINE . . . what has changed and I'm really proud of how she's handled it. But it, it's upsetting. 

00:31:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Yeah. So, so you've known her since first grade. And when were you friends? 

00:31:15
MACKENZIE Uhm, we were friends from first grade to third grade and then something changed and from fourth grade on, she's just . . . 

00:31:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Do you, do you know what it is that changed? 

00:31:35
MACKENZIE I have no idea. 

00:31:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And now you're in fifth grade I gather? 

00:31:40
MACKENZIE Ah, sixth. 

00:31:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Sixth grade. Okay. In sixth grade. Okay. Uhm, so can we go back to that situation that you were sharing where you were playing werewolf. How does that game happen? Can you tell me more about that? 

00:31:55
MACKENZIE Uhm, well some guys in our class, they kind of made it up. 

00:32:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:32:00
MACKENZIE So they changed it to where there is one person in at the beginning . . . 

00:32:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:32:05
MACKENZIE . . . and then one is chosen to be the healer. 

00:32:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:32:10
MACKENZIE So that if you get tagged but the healer tags you, you're not it any more. 

00:32:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Oh, okay. So, so there's an extra person called the healer . . . 

00:32:20
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:32:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . that can tag you. Okay. 

00:32:20
MACKENZIE But the healer's a secret person and you can't tell anybody. 

00:32:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Oh, I see. I see. Is that a fun game? 

00:32:25
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:32:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So do you folks play it a lot? 

00:32:30
MACKENZIE Yeah. We play it more towards the beginning of the year and then like the first couple like, like--we probably play it for like a month in the beginning of the school year. 

00:32:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:32:40
MACKENZIE And then we kind of go off and play our own games. 

00:32:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN I see. Okay. So is that a game that you look forward to playing? 

00:32:50
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:32:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. So I wanted to go back to the example where you were playing werewolf. And, uhm, uhm, and go back to, to how you solved that situation. It sounds like, ah, would you say that you solved it or would you say that you handled it in some ways that, that you liked or that were helpful or . . . 

00:33:10
MACKENZIE Yeah. I would say that I handled in a way that I probably never handled it before. 

00:33:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:33:15
MACKENZIE So, yeah. 

00:33:15
Putting words to intentions 

00:33:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, so let's go back there. Uhm, so you were playing werewolf and then, uhm, you saw her running towards you . . . 

00:33:25
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . would you say that? Yeah? 

00:33:25
MACKENZIE Yeah. So I started to run in the other direction. 

00:33:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:33:30
MACKENZIE But she take a shortcut in front of me. 

00:33:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:33:30
MACKENZIE And she tripped me. 

00:33:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And, uhm, are you sure that she tripped you on purpose or . . . 

00:33:40
MACKENZIE Yeah. She, uhm, stuck her foot out and she kind of giggled when I fell . . . 

00:33:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:33:45
MACKENZIE . . . on the floor. 

00:33:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So, uhm, so that kind of told you that she was doing it on purpose? 

00:33:50
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:33:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And so she stuck her foot out and then she tripped you and you fell on the floor and she giggled. And then what happened for you inside? 

00:34:00
MACKENZIE Well, I felt really hurt because I didn't know that we've--that we haven't been friends in such a long time and I didn't really get why she would do that. 

00:34:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you started wondering why did she do that? 

00:34:15
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:34:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And you had some hurt feelings? 

00:34:15
MACKENZIE Yeah. Hurt feelings . . . 

00:34:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:34:20
MACKENZIE . . . mostly. 

00:34:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hurt feelings and, and, and your knee was scraped. 

00:34:25
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:34:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And, ah, did the hurt feelings make you tempted to say or do something to her? 

00:34:30
MACKENZIE It made me tempted . . . 

00:34:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:34:30
MACKENZIE But I didn't want to because I know what might of, ah, backfired on me and I might have got in trouble. 

00:34:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:34:40
MACKENZIE So instead I, I walked away. 

00:34:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Okay. So can you tell me examples of things that the hurt feelings may have made you tempted to do that you didn't do? 

00:34:50
MACKENZIE Well, uhm, it might have made me-- it made me kind of tempted to call her a name . . . 

00:34:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:35:00
MACKENZIE . . . or maybe like yell at her or something. 

00:35:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:35:00
MACKENZIE Maybe kind of make me want to do it back. But I knew that if I did that, it would eventually backfire on me. 

00:35:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So it made you tempted to call her a name and yell at her back, but then there's--sounds like there was another part of you that was able to, to think ooh, maybe I shouldn't do that . . . 

00:35:20
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:35:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . because it might backfire on me? Yeah. Okay. 

00:35:25
Inquiring about invisibles 

00:35:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And, uhm, is there something that, uhm, that you saw about her that, that, that you know about her that helps you also make the decision to not yell at her or . . . 

00:35:40
MACKENZIE Well I kind of know that now she's like a bully so that if you play with a bully, then you probably will end up either being a bully or getting hurt by the bully. 

00:35:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. So you were seeing her as a bully or as someone who has a habit of bullying? 

00:36:05
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:36:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And, uhm, that made you think that, uhm, then if you make the decision to play with her, then there's a good likelihood to, to become a bully? 

00:36:15
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:36:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Do you have some understanding of, uhm, how she might have fallen for that habit of bullying since you were friends before? 

00:36:25
MACKENZIE Uhm, all I know that is at the end of the school year in third grade, we left school with a big hug and then we didn't see each other for the whole entire summer. 

00:36:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:36:40
MACKENZIE And then, uhm, in fourth grade at like towards the beginning, she just kind of like changed. 

00:36:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. So you said that at the end of third grade, you left giving each other a hug and then in fourth grade you started and that things were different? 

00:37:00
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:37:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Uhm, might, might something have happened to her that might have changed her over the summer? 

00:37:05
MACKENZIE Well, I did hear some rumors that she had to stay at her grandma's, uhm, either because of something that happened in her family or like just something happened. 

00:37:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:37:20
MACKENZIE Uhm, I didn't know--I don't know the full story but that's what I heard. 

00:37:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So you heard that something had happened to her. 

00:37:25
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:37:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And, ah, do you think that whatever happened to her may have kind of contributed to her kind of starting to do more bullying behaviors? 

00:37:35
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:37:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And does, does it make a difference if you remember that something happened to her and that it contributes to it? 

00:37:45
MACKENZIE Yeah because if you don't remember, then you might get mad at her and yell back. 

00:37:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:37:50
MACKENZIE But sometimes when you do remember, you kind of say, okay, I know she's gone through this, so I'm going to like--I'm going to calm down and I'm going to go talk to her in a very calm and polite way. 

00:38:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So when you do remember that something happened to her and it may be invisible, you know, when you're hearing the mean word . . . 

00:38:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:38:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . it may be invisible but you know that it's kind of there in her background? 

00:38:15
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:38:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So when you're able to remember that, it kind of helps you respond to her differently? 

00:38:20
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:38:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. Okay. 

00:38:25
Collecting other examples of skills to confirm their existence 

00:38:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And can you think of some other examples of times . . . 

00:38:30
MACKENZIE Uhm . . . 

00:38:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . where you might have done things differently? 

00:38:30
MACKENZIE Yeah. Uhm, one time we were coming out for lunch and, uhm, she pushed me and I fell in the tanbark and she giggled and went to lunch. And, uhm, I sat there taking all--like brushing away all the tanbark. 

00:38:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:38:50
MACKENZIE And I sat there and I just thought for a while and then I went and I went very calmly and very friendly and I went and talked to her and made sure that first of all, she knew that it wasn't okay and second of all, it wasn't I wasn't there to be mean. I was there to be her friend. 

00:39:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So that's a time where you handled things differently . . . 

00:39:15
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:39:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . where you kind of took a minute to brush the tanbark off, but then you got up and decided to go talk to her? 

00:39:20
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:39:20
Putting words to intentions 

00:39:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN How did you make that decision to go talk to her? What was, what was your intention? 

00:39:25
MACKENZIE Uhm, well, I was thinking of being her friend and not just hurting her. I was also making sure that she knew that it wasn't okay to push me or to push anybody else. 

00:39:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So did you find a balance between talking to her really nicely and then kind of, kind of expressing that it, it wasn't okay that she pushed you that way? 

00:39:50
MACKENZIE Yeah, well she got a little angry when I told her that it's not really okay to push people. 

00:40:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:40:00
MACKENZIE Especially if they fall and like hit something hard that might hurt. 

00:40:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:40:05
MACKENZIE And then, uhm, she had to think about it for a while. 

00:40:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:40:10
MACKENZIE And then she said she was sorry and then everything was kind of okay for the rest of the day. 

00:40:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So she said she was sorry and then everything was okay for the rest of the day. Okay. And, uhm, when you were able to, uhm, to stand up from falling in the tanbark and walk towards her in a nice way, what were you holding on in your mind? Where you kind of holding on about an intention that where you wanted this to go? 

00:40:40
MACKENZIE Yeah. I was holding on to the--that I really wanted her to be friendly and I wanted us to kind of be friends again. 

00:40:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:40:55
MACKENZIE And that we haven't been friends for a long time. 

00:40:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
MACKENZIE And I kind of wanted that to change. 

00:41:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So that was your intention, that you wanted things to change. You wanted her to be your friend again. And, ah, you wanted the two of you to start interacting in a more friendly way. 

00:41:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:41:10
Double Vision 

00:41:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So that was your intention. And did you see her a little differently than, than seeing her just as a bully? Did you, did you think of her a little differently than that? 

00:41:25
MACKENZIE Well, when she apologized, I really thought, uhm, uhm, well first of all, wow. I've like ever since that thing happened in fourth grade, I really never heard her say such a nice thing back to me. 

00:41:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Hmm. What effect did that have on you when she apologized? 

00:41:50
MACKENZIE Well, I was kind of shocked . . . 

00:41:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:41:50
MACKENZIE . . . that she apologized. And, uhm, I mean after that we ate our lunch together and then we played a game together. 

00:42:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So you had your lunch together and you played a game. And how did that go? 

00:42:10
MACKENZIE Good. Like there was no fighting during the game. 

00:42:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:42:15
MACKENZIE We were like friends again and then . . . 

00:42:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. So when you were friends again, what, what else came forward about her? Like what else is there about her? 

00:42:30
MACKENZIE That she can have a soft side. 

00:42:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:42:30
MACKENZIE And not really a soft side. 

00:42:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN She can have a soft side and not really a soft side . . . 

00:42:40
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:42:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So she can have both. So there's many sides to her. 

00:42:40
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:42:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Can you tell me more about her soft side? Like is it that you'd like to be her friend? 

00:42:50
MACKENZIE Uhm, well when she has like--when she's nice, she's very calm. 

00:43:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:43:00
MACKENZIE She's not like intro--she's not upset at the little things. 

00:43:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
MACKENZIE She kind of just like brushes them away and then focuses what we were doing. 

00:43:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So when, when she's, uhm, she's with her soft side, then she can be calm and not upset at little things. 

00:43:20
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:43:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN She's more able to brush them away. Yeah. And is there other things about her that, that make you interested in being her friend sometimes? 

00:43:30
MACKENZIE Yeah. Well just the fact that she can like change in a couple of seconds . . . 

00:43:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:43:35
MACKENZIE . . . and she stays that way for a long time. 

00:43:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:43:45
MACKENZIE That's why makes me like really, really happy and makes me what to me her friend again. 

00:43:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So it makes you happy that she can change. 

00:43:55
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:43:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:00
Articulating the kind of person hone chooses to be 

00:44:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And, uhm, so going back to when, when you got up from the tanbark and you had that intention of being friends again and wanting these interactions to change, what kind of person did you become? 

00:44:20
MACKENZIE Uhm, I would say that I became a good friend . . . 

00:44:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:44:25
MACKENZIE . . . I'd say. 

00:44:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Became good a friend. Okay. Was there a side of you that, ah, was a good friend and, ah, at the same time wanted to make sure that you kind of, uhm, took care of yourself too? 

00:44:45
MACKENZIE Yeah. I'd--yeah cuz when I got up, not only did I want to tell her that it's not nice to push people . . . 

00:44:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:44:55
MACKENZIE . . . uhm, I also wanted to-- like I also wanted to stay friends with her. 

00:45:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So tell her it's not nice to push people. That's not okay. And I want to stay friends. 

00:45:05
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:45:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Like finding a balance between these two things? 

00:45:10
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:45:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So does that mean that you talked to her with a specific tone of voice or, or how would you describe how one can talk to a person in a way that accomplishes these two really different things, right? 

00:45:25
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:45:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Saying it's not okay and I want to be your friend is tricky. 

00:45:30
MACKENZIE Well, I stayed in a very calm voice when I talked to her. 

00:45:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:45:35
MACKENZIE Uhm, and I just had to make sure that I addressed it in a way that she wouldn't get mad. 

00:45:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Oh. So you addressed it in a way that she wouldn't get mad. How do you do that? 

00:45:50
MACKENZIE Well, you have to realize that even though she's not nice to you . . . 

00:46:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:46:00
MACKENZIE You have to be nice to her and so you talk to her like how you would talk to your best friend. 

00:46:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So when you say that even though she's not nice, you can stay nice to her, does that mean that even though she's not nice, you can still hold onto the kind of person you like to be? 

00:46:20
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:46:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? And the kind of person you like to be, would you say is to be a nice person? 

00:46:25
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:46:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So, uhm, tell me more about the kind of person you like to be. Like what do you mean by "nice"? You know, people mean different things. 

00:46:35
MACKENZIE Yeah. Well, I mean like the girl who doesn't really stay mad at someone. 

00:46:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:46:40
MACKENZIE I don't hold a grudge against people. 

00:46:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:46:45
MACKENZIE And like I can be like friendly when I--like when another person is nice, I can be just as friendly. 

00:47:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:47:00
MACKENZIE And sometimes I need to take a moment to myself. 

00:47:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
MACKENZIE And kind of like brush away the dust. 

00:47:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:47:10
MACKENZIE And-- yeah. 

00:47:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So you're the kind of person who likes to be friendly with other people, to take moments to yourself, who likes to be nice and you mentioned also earlier that you, you can have a calm voice. 

00:47:30
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:47:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? Uhm, anything else you would say about the kind of person you like to be? 

00:47:35
MACKENZIE Uhm, well I--this is like people say it's a very good thing about me . . . 

00:47:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:47:45
MACKENZIE . . . that I don't hold grudges against people. 

00:47:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Right, that's true. You had said that earlier too. 

00:47:55
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:47:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN I'm glad you brought that back. You don't hold grudges. Now does that make a big difference in dealing with situations that . . . 

00:48:00
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:48:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . tend to become like that? 

00:48:00
MACKENZIE . . . cuz when you hold a grudge against someone . . . 

00:48:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:48:05
MACKENZIE . . . then the other person starts to get really mad. 

00:48:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:48:10
MACKENZIE And they can hold an even bigger grudge against you. 

00:48:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:48:15
Mentioning patterns of interactions 

00:48:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN It kind of goes around in circles, huh? Like if I was to draw some of the things you said earlier, so if somebody, uhm, does some bullying and then you hold grudges then you folks kind of go around and around, you know. Like if this, uhm, your friend and this is you, and so, so she engages in some bullying, uhm, behavior and then you hold grudges and you're angry so you don't treat her well, that kind of feeds the bullying. 

00:49:00
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:49:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And then that feel--feeds your grudges and goes around and around in circles. Yeah. And then you shared with me the other pattern of interaction which is the flip to this is that if you're nice to her, even though sometimes she's not so nice or, you know, she has a grumpy day or--then it might kind of feed the other pattern of interaction where she becomes friendly with you again. Yeah? And then you folks can play and have fun playing together. Yeah. Okay. When you're able to, uhm, hold onto your intention that you want her to be your friend and you want these interactions to change and, uhm, when you're able to see her as somebody who has a soft side and who's able to be upset but also to change really quickly and you're able to appreciate her. And when you're able to be the kind of person that you'd like, which is to be a good friend and to not hold grudges and to be, uhm, calm, then you're able to solve some of these situations? 

00:50:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:50:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? So when you're able to solve some of these situations, it sounds like afterwards the effects of that that you can play together and have fun. Yeah. Okay. And have fun. Did this happen only at a time where you folks, ah, when she pushed you in the tanbark or did this happen some other times too? 

00:50:35
MACKENZIE Well, it definitely happens more than just a few times. 

00:50:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:50:40
MACKENZIE Like, uhm, it's happened actually quite a few times in fourth and fifth grade. 

00:50:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So it's happened a few times in fourth and fifth grade. Yeah. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:50:55
Balancing preferred-self-based choices and the necessity to create accountability with others' gestures of aggression. 

00:51:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN What would be, where would you draw the line between something that she would do that, that you can kind of not hold a grudge and just talk to her calmly and something that she would do, uhm, because of her bullying habit that is just not okay and that you need to do a little something more? 

00:51:20
MACKENZIE Well, uhm, actually one time she really she just went way overboard. 

00:51:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:51:30
MACKENZIE And she had not only embarrassed me but she called me very-- really, really mean names. 

00:51:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:51:40
MACKENZIE And she was just really mean that day. That's when I told a stand for myself and I said . . . 

00:51:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:51:50
MACKENZIE . . . I'm not going to listen to you talk to me like that. 

00:51:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:51:55
MACKENZIE And I went to our vice principal and I talked to her about it so that she would do something about Alexis' bullying habits--or Alex. 

00:52:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you went to your vice principal and you told yourself--and you told her, I won't listen to you talk to me that way? 

00:52:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:52:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. And, uhm, how was that--what was happening for you inside when, ah, when you felt that way? 

00:52:20
MACKENZIE Well, uhm, when she first called me it, I felt really hurt. 

00:52:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:52:30
MACKENZIE And then when I went and I stood up for myself and I told her that and then I went to talk to our vice principal, I felt very good of--about myself. 

00:52:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:52:40
MACKENZIE Because I've never stood up to her like that. 

00:52:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So you felt good about yourself . . . 

00:52:45
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:52:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . for doing that? Yeah. What, what, uhm, what is it that triggered that standing up for yourself? Like is it because of the kind of words that she used or what is it that kind of pushed you over in doing something different like that? 

00:53:00
MACKENZIE Well, it was the kind of words she used for sure. 

00:53:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. The kind of words . . . 

00:53:05
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:53:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . which are just not acceptable. 

00:53:05
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:53:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. And so you have that limit inside of you . . . 

00:53:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:53:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . of some situations you solve by being nice and calm and talking to her and then there are other situations where you just need some adult help? 

00:53:20
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:53:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. So you stood up for yourself and that felt good inside. 

00:53:25
Strengthening the neural networks for the experience of skills 

00:53:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Could you, uhm, could you go back to that moment and, uhm, and help me kind of get a sense of what it feels inside of you when, when you do something like that? So, uhm, can you go back to where you were? Let's start by where you were, ah, when that happened. Was that, you know, like by the cafeteria or by the playground? 

00:53:50
MACKENZIE Uhm, we were at the basketball courts. 

00:53:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:53:55
MACKENZIE And almost all the girls in fifth grade were playing and we were all there and then, uhm, so we were playing in teams. 

00:54:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:54:10
MACKENZIE And she was on the same that I was on . . . 

00:54:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:54:15
MACKENZIE And, uhm, I missed the basket that would've, have us won the game . . . 

00:54:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:54:20
MACKENZIE . . . and then that's where everything started. 

00:54:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So you missed the basket and that's when she started calling you names? 

00:54:30
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:54:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And, uhm, did you decide right away that this was just not acceptable? 

00:54:35
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:54:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Did you tell her some of it or . . . 

00:54:40
MACKENZIE No, like she went from straight to embarrassing, which I was kind of okay with and then she went right to the part where I drew the line and I said that's not okay. You cannot talk to me like that. 

00:54:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. You drew the line. What did you feel that shifted inside of you? You know sometimes we feel kind of like a shift? 

00:55:00
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. Well, the embarrassing was stuff that she had already said and . . . 

00:55:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:55:05
MACKENZIE . . . so that was kind of like okay, everybody already knows that so that's, that's okay. 

00:55:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:55:10
MACKENZIE But then when she started saying what she said after that . . . 

00:55:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

00:55:15
MACKENZIE . . . that--it just flipped everything in like two seconds. It just flipped around and I said that's not okay. 

00:55:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Okay. And if you were to kind of describe the--how your body felt, like the sensations inside of you when that switch happened. Like, you know, would--were you breathing differently or did something harden inside of you or how would you describe your body inside? 

00:55:40
MACKENZIE Well, I, I would say that when she started saying that that I definitely started to tense. 

00:55:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:55:50
MACKENZIE I was very--I was really angry. 

00:55:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:56:00
MACKENZIE And you could just tell that I was starting to gather a lot of angry. 

00:56:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So you felt that there was a lot of anger and you started to tense? 

00:56:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:56:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Where in particular did you tense up? 

00:56:10
MACKENZIE Well, my, my face started like coming together and my shoulders started like hardening like . . . 

00:56:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:56:20
MACKENZIE . . . like I couldn't like move them. 

00:56:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:56:20
MACKENZIE Because they--I just got so angry. 

00:56:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:56:25
MACKENZIE And then--yeah. 

00:56:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And, uhm, what was the anger making you think of? Was the anger making you think mostly of talking to the vice principal or did the anger make you think something . . . 

00:56:35
MACKENZIE It was--first--first, I knew that I had to tell someone. First, I knew that I had to stand up for myself. 

00:56:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So the anger was really, uhm, telling you to stand up for yourself . . . 

00:56:45
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:56:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . and tell someone. Yeah. Okay. Stand up and tell. Okay. And, uhm, and then you walked to the vice principal. 

00:57:00
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:57:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? Was the vice principal close by? 

00:57:00
MACKENZIE Uhm, well I had to walk up to the office. 

00:57:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:57:05
MACKENZIE Uhm, I, I wouldn't say it's that far away. 

00:57:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:57:10
MACKENZIE She was sort of close by. 

00:57:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And did she try to intervene with you walking into the office or . . . 

00:57:15
MACKENZIE Well, first of all, she didn't know where I was going. 

00:57:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

00:57:20
MACKENZIE So she was kind of like oh, where you going now? To tell, uhm, Misty S . . . 

00:57:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:57:30
MACKENZIE . . . which is the person on play guard duty everyday. 

00:57:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:57:35
MACKENZIE And so I just ignored her and I kept walking. 

00:57:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Hmm. So you just ignored her and kept walking. So what was your intention? Mostly to stand up for yourself or mostly to get help or . . . 

00:57:50
MACKENZIE Uhm . . . 

00:57:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . because you kept walking. Were you clear about what you wanted to say? 

00:57:55
MACKENZIE Well, I was--yeah, I was really clear about what I wanted to say. 

00:57:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:58:00
MACKENZIE And I wanted to make sure that Alex got what she deserved. 

00:58:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. So you wanted to make sure she got what she deserved. Yeah. Did you have any other intentions? 

00:58:10
MACKENZIE No cuz she's not only that she does that to me, she does it to other people to. 

00:58:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

00:58:15
MACKENZIE And so I wanted to make sure that she knew that she was going to get in trouble. 

00:58:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So you wanted to make sure she knew she was going to get in trouble and that she knew it wasn't okay to do that for you . . . 

00:58:30
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

00:58:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . or for others. 

00:58:30
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:58:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So were you also a little bit standing up for others too? 

00:58:35
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:58:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So you were standing for yourself and for others. 

00:58:40
Expanding on the experience of standing up for herself and the rippling effects 

00:58:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And how did that affect your relationship with her afterwards? 

00:58:50
MACKENZIE Well, I guess she just knew that now I'm not someone who can just be pushed around . . . 

00:58:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:58:55
MACKENZIE . . . and I'll just like feel bad for myself . . . 

00:59:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:59:00
MACKENZIE . . . that I had a--I have a reason to stand up for myself too. 

00:59:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So you're not someone who can be pushed around? 

00:59:05
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

00:59:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And you're someone who can stand up for herself. Okay. Okay. So it sounds like you're able to, uhm, to handle a lot of her different behaviors. Did you know some of these stories? 

00:59:25
[sil.] 

00:59:25
Recruiting the parent as a witness to skills previously unnoticed 

00:59:30
CATHERINE I did but not to this extent. And it makes me actually very proud to know the way that she handled them in such a mature way. And, you know, not fighting back and seeking an adult when need be. 

00:59:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

00:59:45
CATHERINE But also standing up for herself so she doesn't get pushed around. 

00:59:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So you knew some of these stories but not . . . 

00:59:55
CATHERINE No, not, not in the detail. 

00:59:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So now we know that she's able to be calm and handle the situation . . . 

00:59:55
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:59:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . by herself and also be able to draw the line. 

01:00:00
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:00:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN What difference does that make for you as a mom to know that, that your daughter can do that? 

01:00:05
CATHERINE Really happy. 

01:00:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:00:05
CATHERINE And it makes me feel safe. 

01:00:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:00:10
CATHERINE That I know that, you know, she is going to get hurt. That's a part of growing up. 

01:00:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:00:15
CATHERINE But knowing where to draw the line. 

01:00:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Yeah. So it makes you feel safer. . . 

01:00:20
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:00:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . about sending her to school. 

01:00:20
CATHERINE Exactly. She knows where to draw the line. 

01:00:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Is there one thing in particular that stood up in, in the things that she shared, ah, doing in those situations or . . . 

01:00:35
CATHERINE I would say, you know, uhm, fighting back with kindness . . . 

01:00:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:00:35
CATHERINE . . . rather than with hurtful words because that's very easy . . . 

01:00:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:00:40
CATHERINE . . . when someone is saying mean things to you is to just say mean things back. But she actually the time to decide no, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to be nice to her . . . 

01:00:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:00:50
CATHERINE . . . because maybe that will bring out the niceness in her. 

01:00:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. What does that mean for you as a mom to know that your daughter is able to fight back with kindness? 

01:01:05
CATHERINE Must be doing something right. 

01:01:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Is there some of that that you might have learned from your mom? 

01:01:10
MACKENZIE Yeah, for sure. 

01:01:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Does your mom, ah, able to fight back with kindness? 

01:01:15
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

01:01:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? Can you think of a, a specific time where you saw your mom do that? 

01:01:20
MACKENZIE Uhm, not right now I can't. 

01:01:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:01:25
MACKENZIE But I'll probably think of one. 

01:01:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So you know that it happened. 

01:01:25
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

01:01:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Is that, ah, part of your values? 

01:01:30
CATHERINE Yeah, I would say so. I mean, we have three daughters. So, you know, those things come up but I remind them that we're all family. 

01:01:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:01:40
CATHERINE And, you know, that's what's most important is family. 

01:01:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:01:45
CATHERINE So don't be, don't be rude to your family because that's who supports you. 

01:01:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:01:50
CATHERINE And you treat your friends like your family . . . 

01:01:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:01:55
CATHERINE . . . then you're only going to end up with lifelong friends. 

01:01:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:01:55
CATHERINE So. 

01:01:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you, you really encourage them to treat your, your family . . . 

01:02:00
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:02:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . you know, as people who will be there for a long time for you. 

01:02:05
CATHERINE Exactly. 

01:02:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And then do you as a mom also encourage your daughters to stand up for themselves when necessary? 

01:02:10
CATHERINE I do. I do. 

01:02:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:02:10
CATHERINE Because, you know, throughout life people are always going to try and bring you down because everyone has, you know, their issues. 

01:02:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:02:20
CATHERINE But you should always just be kind to one anoth--one another because you don't know what people are going through. 

01:02:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:02:25
CATHERINE And it may be something really awful. 

01:02:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:02:30
CATHERINE And most of the time, people just want someone to talk to. 

01:02:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:02:30
CATHERINE And to express those feelings. And then when you're younger, I think you don't really know how to express those feelings and it comes across in bullying. 

01:02:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Yeah. So that's how you understand . . . 

01:02:40
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:02:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . bullying . . . 

01:02:45
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:02:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . and people don't know how to express their feelings. . . 

01:02:45
CATHERINE Exactly. 

01:02:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . when things happen for them? 

01:02:45
CATHERINE Yeah, because really they're truly hiding something inside that they're, you know, angry at themselves . . . 

01:02:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:02:50
CATHERINE . . . or something's going on and you don't really know what's going on. 

01:02:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:02:55
CATHERINE So I'm very proud that she handles it with kindness . . . 

01:02:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:03:00
CATHERINE . . . because you don't know. 

01:03:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Right. There can be so many invisible . . . 

01:03:00
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:03:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . factors about people's life that we don't know. Yeah. And it sounds like you--it was helpful for you to kind of hold onto some of these ideas too? 

01:03:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

01:03:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay.

Strengthening neural encoding and further integrating the skills by asking the client to draw the experience 

01:03:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Now, uhm, could I ask you to draw what it felt like inside, ah, when you were kind of standing up for yourself and, and, and maybe also draw how it felt inside when you were handling the situation with calm and, ah, just being able to talk with her in a friendly way? 

01:03:40
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

01:03:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Does that seem--are you someone who likes to draw? 

01:03:40
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

01:03:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. Let me give you a piece of paper here. I have some markers. Okay. And I don't know if there's--sometimes people have like a--and it doesn't have to be a specific thing. I don't know if there's a, a metaphor or a, a color. Sometimes people have a color for how it feels inside when they're standing up for themselves, you know, like sometimes people will feel I'll become all of this color or I'll become hard like a rock or I'll become . . . 

01:04:20
CATHERINE Yeah, that's funny. I would chose red. 

01:04:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN You would chose red . . . 

01:04:20
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:04:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . for yourself, yeah. when you're standing up for yourself. 

01:04:25
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:04:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And how about when you're handling things with kindness and calm? 

01:04:30
CATHERINE Probably like a light blue. 

01:04:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:04:30
CATHERINE A nice calming color. 

01:04:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:04:35
CATHERINE Yeah, color association. 

01:04:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Do you find yourself, ah, responding to your daughters sometimes with these different, these different experiences? 

01:04:45
CATHERINE Yeah. 

01:04:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Do you want to tell me a little bit what you're drawing? 

01:04:50
MACKENZIE Well, this is my friend at the basketball hoops. And I'm kind of like I've already stood up for myself. And so instead of fighting with her, I walked away from her. 

01:05:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:05:05
MACKENZIE And I kind of have a smile on my face because I know I did the right thing. 

01:05:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:05:10
MACKENZIE And I'm headed to the office where the vice principal is. 

01:05:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. And I noticed that you chose the color black. Is that how it, it might feel inside or . . . 

01:05:20
MACKENZIE Well . . . 

01:05:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . you just randomly chose that? 

01:05:20
MACKENZIE I just kind of randomly picked it out of the box. 

01:05:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:05:20
MACKENZIE If I had to pick a color, uhm, I would probably pick purple . . . 

01:05:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:05:30
MACKENZIE . . . because, uhm, in a way, it just makes me calm. 

01:05:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Uh-huh. 

01:05:35
MACKENZIE Makes me--I don't know how to describe it. It just . . . 

01:05:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So the calm, the purple and the calm are associated . . . 

01:05:45
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

01:05:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . with each other? Yeah. Is that, uhm, is purple one of your favorite colors or . . . 

01:05:50
MACKENZIE Yeah. 

01:05:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN It's one of your favorite. Is it "the" favorite color? 

01:05:55
MACKENZIE It is my favorite color. 

01:05:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN I was noticing the purple shirt. 

01:05:55
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

01:05:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Nice. So nice shirt. So purple is your favorite color and you associate it with calm. And so when you become the kind of person that you like to be, there's, there's a sense of purple-ness you think? 

01:06:10
MACKENZIE Uh-huh. 

01:06:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Sense of purple-ness. Okay. 

01:06:15
[sil.] 

01:06:15
The conversation continues with gathering more details on metaphors and images representing valuable "brain states" and skills. Mackenzie spontaneously associates colors with different experiences of herself. 

01:06:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN In my interview with Mackenzie, she gave me a number of examples of situations that were difficult at school. Mackenzie was clear in her intentions to be friends with this girl that had pushed her in our first example. McKenzie was also very clear about her intentions to stand up for herself in the last example we examined. Sometimes people are not so clear about their intentions and I might just drop this territory altogether and come back to it at the very end of the interview.

Exploring problems and skills with an adult: Meeting the person and understanding the "Not-good-enough feeling" 

01:07:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hi Victoria. 

01:07:10
VICTORIA Hi. 

01:07:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So before we start, I always like to ask people what they like to do for fun and, you know, what is going on in your life that you like. 

01:07:20
VICTORIA Uhm, I love to go to the movies. 

01:07:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:07:25
VICTORIA Uhm, shopping. 

01:07:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:07:30
VICTORIA Uhm, and that's pretty much what I like to do, ah, during the day. 

01:07:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:07:35
VICTORIA Uhm, right now I'm, I'm struggling with my relationship with my dad. 

01:07:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:07:40
VICTORIA And just feeling I can't measure up to what his standards and feeling I'll never be good enough of a daughter for him. 

01:07:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:08:00
VICTORIA And I'm just really struggling on how to deal with that. 

01:08:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:08:00
VICTORIA It's just prolonging for a very long time. Uhm, that's why I'm here. 

01:08:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Okay. So feeling like you can't measure up to your dad's standards and feeling that you're not good enough? 

01:08:15
VICTORIA Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah. 

01:08:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Can you give me an example of, of a time when that happened recently, that feeling of not good enough? 

01:08:20
VICTORIA Ah, the most recent was actually over the weekend. 

01:08:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:08:30
VICTORIA Uhm, I visit my parents about twice a month. Uhm, just because-- just to keep them happy. 

01:08:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:08:40
VICTORIA So they see me more often. Uhm . . . 

01:08:45
[sil.] 

01:08:45
Getting a recent example of the problem, and Victoria's experience. 

01:08:50
VICTORIA So, yeah. 

01:08:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So, so you were at that dinner over the weekend . . . 

01:08:55
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:08:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . and all this, your parent brought up all sorts of, of issues, such moneymaking and getting married and . . . 

01:09:00
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:09:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . and, uhm, grandkids . . . 

01:09:05
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:09:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . and, uhm--and what happened for you when they started bringing up all of those things? What happened for you inside? 

01:09:15
VICTORIA Uhm, I just like took it in. 

01:09:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:09:20
VICTORIA I put up with it. Uhm, one thing is I don't want to get into an argument with them, so I don't talk back. 

01:09:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:09:30
VICTORIA And--or raise my voice or justify too much. If anything, I just laugh it off. 

01:09:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:09:40
VICTORIA And make jokes. Like at least I look 25, you know. 

01:09:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:09:45
VICTORIA Uhm, no one will know how old I am. Uhm, I just--I use a lot of comic relief. 

01:09:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:09:50
VICTORIA Uhm, but I feel really bad. I do feel bad. 

01:09:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So there is a part of you that, that felt bad and, and you mentioned earlier that you felt that there is this not-good-enough feeling, that you couldn't measure up. And then there's another part of you that's able to laugh it off and, and put up with it. 

01:10:10
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:10:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Uhm, can you tell me a little bit more about each one of those two different experiences of yourself? Like if we start with the not good enough, uhm, feeling, what happens when that not good enough, can't measure up feeling is triggered? Was it triggered during the weekend dinner? 

01:10:30
VICTORIA Yes, it was. It doesn't really help when he reminds me and my brother, but mostly me, ah, that he didn't go to college. 

01:10:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:10:45
VICTORIA And that he came from nothing and now he's financially well off. And he looks at us--looks at me as I'm struggling, I have a college degree. He gave me everything. 

01:11:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:11:00
VICTORIA Uhm, but I'm still not making enough money. And to him making enough money is, I guess, I don't how much money, a lot of money. But I feel that as long as I can take care of myself and I can pay my own bills, I can do what I have to do. I'm fine. But it's just never--just not good enough, ever good enough. 

01:11:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Yeah, so you feel that as long as you're able to take care of yourself, then that's really what matters. 

01:11:30
VICTORIA Yeah, but then I start doubting again and every--yeah, I can see. Oh! Yeah. 

01:11:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN That doubting experience. 

01:11:35
VICTORIA It's true though because I, I mean, they're financially--they never wor--have to worry about money. But I, I mean, I still have to work really hard, I know. 

01:11:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:11:40
VICTORIA But it's just that constant reminder that . . . 

01:11:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. It's that constant reminder. Yeah. So they're financially well off. And then what is their ethnicity? 

01:11:55
VICTORIA They're Chinese. 

01:11:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN They're Chinese. Are they Chinese America or they're, they're born in China? 

01:11:55
VICTORIA They're born in China. I'm, I was born here. 

01:12:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you're first generation. 

01:12:00
VICTORIA I'm first generation. 

01:12:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. And what does it mean for them, you think, this financial status? What does it represent? 

01:12:15
VICTORIA Ah, uhm, for them or for me? 

01:12:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN For them and for you. 

01:12:20
VICTORIA Uhm, sometimes I think that maybe they--maybe they may feel--he may feel like a failure because I'm not where he wants me to be. 

01:12:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:12:40
VICTORIA So maybe that's why he's so hard on me. 

01:12:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:12:45
VICTORIA And that makes me feel, uhm, sad. 

01:12:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Uh-huh. So sometimes the, the doubting yourself and the not good enough feeling makes you think that he thinks that, ah, that you're not where you're supposed to be and that makes him as a failure as a dad? 

01:13:10
VICTORIA I think, I, I feel it but I'm not sure but . . . 

01:13:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:13:15
VICTORIA . . . it just--I think so. 

01:13:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So that doubting kind of . . . 

01:13:15
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:13:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . makes you think of that. Yeah. 

01:13:20
VICTORIA Sort of makes me feel, ah, just a lot of pressure. 

01:13:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. It puts a lot of pressure. Do you have a sense of where that comes from for him, this sense of importance of making money? Does that come from his culture of origin and from his upbringing? 

01:13:40
VICTORIA I do. Uhm, because it's part of taking care of your family. 

01:13:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:13:40
VICTORIA It's part of not worry about, uhm, that I'm able to take care of myself. 

01:13:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:13:55
VICTORIA Uhm, something like that. 

01:13:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So for him, for him, it represents taking care of his family? 

01:14:00
VICTORIA Uh-huh. Yes. 

01:14:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And, and so if you become successful, then it means that he took good care of his family? 

01:14:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:14:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:14:10
VICTORIA I believe so, yeah. 

01:14:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Is that a belief that, uhm, that comes from his culture, from his upbringing, you think? 

01:14:20
VICTORIA Yes, because all his other brothers, their kids . . . 

01:14:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:14:25
VICTORIA . . . are very successful. All of them. 

01:14:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:14:25
VICTORIA Every single one of them. 

01:14:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:14:25
VICTORIA Yeah. They're over-achievers. 

01:14:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:14:30
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:14:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:14:30
VICTORIA I'm sort of the black sheep it seems like. 

01:14:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Uh-huh. Okay. So would, would it be right to say that, that doubting of yourself makes you think that you're a black sheep? 

01:14:40
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:14:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. The doubting makes you think that. Uhm, so if it comes from, uhm, the culture and that's kind of part of--his thinking is shaped by that, do you think that there might be another part of his thinking that, that sees you differently than that? 

01:15:05
VICTORIA I'm not sure. 

01:15:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Not sure. Do you feel sometimes that he might value you as a daughter in some other way? 

01:15:15
VICTORIA I know he loves me. 

01:15:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:15:15
VICTORIA And he cares about me, uhm . . . 

01:15:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:15:20
VICTORIA . . . because I don't think that he would, ah, well I know that's part because my, my grandma would remind me . . . 

01:15:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:15:30
VICTORIA . . . that he only is talking this way because you're his only daughter. 

01:15:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:15:40
VICTORIA So he cares. 

01:15:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:15:40
VICTORIA So, so that's value. 

01:15:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Okay. So you know that, that he loves you and your grandma reminds of that. 

01:15:50
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:15:50
A closer look at the problem and its effects 

01:15:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Let me backtrack a little bit and, uhm, ask you a few more questions about, ah, what happens, uhm, after dinners like you had this past weekend. 

01:16:05
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:16:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And that not-good-enough feeling and feeling that you're not measuring up, ah, is triggered. When that feeling is triggered, uhm, what effect does it have on what you say or what you do in your conversations with them? 

01:16:25
VICTORIA Well I lose my appetite. 

01:16:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:16:30
VICTORIA Uhm, I get very frustrated. 

01:16:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:16:35
VICTORIA Uhm, but I don't show that I'm upset or I don't show that I'm angry. 

01:16:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:16:45
VICTORIA I suppress it. Uhm, I just keep--I change the subject. 

01:16:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:16:50
VICTORIA Yeah, I change the subject. 

01:16:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN You change the subject. And does that not-good-enough feeling end up staying with you afterwards when you leave your parents' house? 

01:17:00
VICTORIA It stays for about two days. 

01:17:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:17:05
VICTORIA And then-- and that's the thing about driving away from--I don't live with them. Uhm, I get, I can at least drive back to my apartment, like away. 

01:17:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:17:20
VICTORIA And not see them . . . 

01:17:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:17:20
VICTORIA And have my little break. Takes about two days, two or three days it lingers. 

01:17:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Okay. So it lingers. And while it's lingering, how does it affect what you do in your daily life? How does it change how you go about your day, the not-good-enough feeling? 

01:17:40
VICTORIA Ah, confidence. I, I lose confidence in myself. 

01:17:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:17:45
VICTORIA Sometimes I have trouble sleeping. 

01:17:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:17:50
VICTORIA Times--there are times when I wake up crying. 

01:17:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:17:50
VICTORIA Uhm, I feel . . . 

01:18:00
[sil.] 

01:18:05
VICTORIA . . . I feel anxious and stress out. 

01:18:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Hmm. Uh-huh. 

01:18:15
VICTORIA And so sometimes I take it out on my boyfriend. 

01:18:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:18:20
VICTORIA Ah, which is bad. 

01:18:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:18:25
VICTORIA Uhm, instead of talking about it. 

01:18:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:18:30
VICTORIA Because, because, uhm, not a lot of people understand what I go through. 

01:18:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Hmm. 

01:18:40
VICTORIA And I've lived these pressures for a very long time . . . 

01:18:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:18:45
VICTORIA So . . . 

01:18:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So you've lived with these pressures for a very long time and, and then once they start ruling, then they have all of these effects on you and, ah, they make you lose your confidence and the not-good-enough feeling makes you, ah, cry and have trouble sleeping and feeling anxious and, and taking it out sometimes on people that you don't want to take it out on. 

01:19:10
VICTORIA Right. 

01:19:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:19:15
[sil.] 

01:19:15
Victoria shares an event where she got upset and left a family dinner. This first attempt at identifying skills does not yield meaningful experiences of competency but generates more information about the problem. 

01:19:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . a time where you were able to, uhm, to leave and run the errand and kind of, ah, move away from that not-good-enough feeling? 

01:19:30
VICTORIA No. 

01:19:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN No? Okay. So what, what helpful effect did, did it have? I, I heard that you said this was a good decision for you. 

01:19:45
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:19:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So it was a good decision because you, you didn't end up yelling and falling into an argument. Was this a good decision for yourself too in terms of how, uhm, you felt about yourself? 

01:19:55
VICTORIA I feel it was. I just don't--I'm sure there was a better way to handle it. 

01:20:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:20:05
VICTORIA I just don't know how to communicate with him . . . 

01:20:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:20:05
VICTORIA . . . without screaming. . . 

01:20:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:20:10
VICTORIA . . . or talking back or being mean. 

01:20:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:20:15
VICTORIA Uhm, so I'd rather just ignore it or wun--run away. 

01:20:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:20:25
VICTORIA Uhm, or, ah, just completely avoid it, you know. 

01:20:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:20:30
VICTORIA It's easier. 

01:20:30
If there's a problem, there's a skill (2nd attempt) 

01:20:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So was there ever a time where you, you handled the situation with your dad differently or when you handled that not-good-enough feeling differently where you able to make it go away quicker or you even perhaps were able to avoid feeling it's intensity? 

01:20:50
VICTORIA Yes. 

01:20:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:20:50
VICTORIA Uhm, I did something different with him. 

01:21:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:21:00
VICTORIA Ah, my mom encouraged me to go out on the lake with him and feed the ducks . . . 

01:21:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:21:05
VICTORIA . . . and fish. 

01:21:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:21:10
VICTORIA And he wanted me to take pictures. So I did. We had a nice time. 

01:21:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:21:15
VICTORIA We sat next to each other. He was feeding the fish. I was taking pictures. 

01:21:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:21:20
VICTORIA And that's all we talked about. 

01:21:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. Now is that a recent time? 

01:21:25
VICTORIA That was a recent time. That was nice. 

01:21:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Was there anything in that situation that could have gone in the usual direction of, ah, him making some comments that would trigger the not-good-enough feeling but that you were able to just hear them and not go there? 

01:21:45
VICTORIA He made a small comment. 

01:21:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:21:50
VICTORIA But then I didn't want to focus on that . . . 

01:21:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:21:55
VICTORIA And so I just continued enjoying, you know, my time with him feeding the ducks. 

01:22:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:00
VICTORIA Feeding the fish. 

01:22:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:00
VICTORIA Sitting on the dock. Uhm, talking about other things. 

01:22:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:05
VICTORIA and we were fine. I was fine. 

01:22:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So he made a small comment . . . 

01:22:15
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:22:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . that could have triggered that not-good-enough feeling. 

01:22:15
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:22:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And you were able to, uhm, to not focus on the comment. 

01:22:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? And instead you focused on feeding the fish and sitting on the dock? 

01:22:25
VICTORIA And just talking about something else with him. 

01:22:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Talking about something else. I'm trying to, uhm, to visualize that scene. So would you be both kind of sitting side by side or . . . 

01:22:35
VICTORIA Uh-huh. So we were sitting side by side . . . 

01:22:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:40
VICTORIA . . . on the dock. 

01:22:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:22:40
VICTORIA Uhm, I was taking pictures of, ah, the ducks he was feeding . . . 

01:22:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:45
VICTORIA . . . and the fish he was feeding. 

01:22:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:22:50
VICTORIA And he, he made a very small comment. Uhm, and I just ignored it. 

01:23:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:23:00
VICTORIA And changed the subject. 

01:23:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:23:00
VICTORIA It wasn't a big deal and he didn't mention it again. 

01:23:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. How did you manage to ignore it? Did you tell yourself something that helped you ignore it? 

01:23:10
VICTORIA Ah, just that oh Dad's just being Dad again. 

01:23:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:23:15
VICTORIA And I, and I just--I would tell myself when he does make little comments, just no big deal. 

01:23:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:23:25
VICTORIA It's no big deal. It's just him. He's just being Dad. He's just worried. 

01:23:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:23:30
"Invisibles" can be examined without using this specific word 

01:23:30
VICTORIA Uhm, he's just being Dad. He's just worried. 

01:23:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:23:35
VICTORIA Uhm, and just let it go. Yeah. Don't make it a big deal. 

01:23:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:23:40
VICTORIA I would tell myself. 

01:23:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you were able to tell yourself, just let it go. 

01:23:45
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:23:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN He's just being Dad. He's just worried. Ah, it's no big deal. Yeah. And, ah, when you're able to think that way, do you see your dad differently? Like do you focus on something different about your dad? 

01:24:00
VICTORIA I do actually. I do now . . . 

01:24:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:05
VICTORIA . . . because he's getting older. 

01:24:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:24:05
VICTORIA And he's, he's more--because he's retired . . . 

01:24:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:20
VICTORIA . . . so he's more, uhm, relaxed. 

01:24:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:25
VICTORIA But he still says comments here and there, but it's--he's old. 

01:24:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Uh-huh. 

01:24:30
VICTORIA So I see him older and I just look at him differently now. 

01:24:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:30
VICTORIA Because before he was not as fast. 

01:24:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:35
VICTORIA I mean, sorry, he was--he's just slower I guess. 

01:24:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:45
Intentions 

01:24:45
VICTORIA The way he moves. He's over--he's almost 70-years old. 

01:24:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:24:50
VICTORIA So, uhm, it's nice to see him enjoy the little things in life. 

01:24:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:55
VICTORIA Just feeding the fish, feeding the ducks. 

01:24:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:24:55
VICTORIA He didn't use to do that. 

01:25:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:25:00
VICTORIA He's usually like a go-go kind of a person, on the go. 

01:25:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:25:05
VICTORIA Fast-paced. Uhm, so. 

01:25:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So when, uhm, when you're able to not focus on these comments, when you're able to ignore them, then you have this--you get to this place inside of you that allows you to see different things about your dad, such as him being older and slower and, uhm, and retired. 

01:25:25
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:25:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And that helps you respond differently to the comments? 

01:25:30
VICTORIA Yes. 

01:25:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:25:30
VICTORIA Just me being more understanding of where he's at in his life. 

01:25:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:25:35
VICTORIA So you become more understanding? 

01:25:40
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:25:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. And how else would you describe how you become more understanding and what you would say? 

01:25:50
VICTORIA Well, especially this past year, I've more understanding with what he says, not to take that personal. 

01:26:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:26:00
UNKNOWN Uhm, and have fun maybe with it. 

01:26:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:26:10
VICTORIA Make fun of him. Make it a joke. 

01:26:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:26:15
VICTORIA We've done that until we go back and forth. But it's funny and it's fun. 

01:26:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:26:20
VICTORIA And I'll make fun of him being old. 

01:26:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:26:20
VICTORIA I'll make fun--or he'll make fun of me being old. Ah . . . 

01:26:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. So when you get into that place, then you're able to kind of make fun the comments as . . . 

01:26:35
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:26:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . as opposed to taking them personally? 

01:26:35
VICTORIA Yeah. That was my problem for a long time. 

01:26:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:26:35
VICTORIA I just took it so personally. 

01:26:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And, and you make fun of the comments and then it sounds like you even add some playful comments . . . 

01:26:45
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:26:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . for your dad. 

01:26:45
VICTORIA And the subject changes. 

01:26:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:26:45
VICTORIA And my mom gets in on it. 

01:26:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:26:50
VICTORIA And it's--instead of a heated conversation, it becomes more a . . . 

01:26:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:26:55
VICTORIA . . . playful . . . 

01:27:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:27:00
VICTORIA . . . relaxed situation. 

01:27:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. It becomes a playful and relaxed situation. Yeah. So would you say that you become more connected with your humor or your playful side of you or how would you call that? 

01:27:15
VICTORIA Yeah, we--our family is humorous. 

01:27:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Uh-huh. 

01:27:15
Preferred Self 

01:27:15
VICTORIA We love to tell jokes and very sarcastic. 

01:27:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:27:25
VICTORIA Uhm . . . 

01:27:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:27:25
VICTORIA Yeah, that's how we handle things. 

01:27:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:27:25
VICTORIA If we need to do it lightly, ah, yeah. 

01:27:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you get connected to a more humorous and playful side of yourself? 

01:27:35
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:27:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And also a side that's more understanding . . . 

01:27:35
VICTORIA Right. 

01:27:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . about where he's at in his life . . . 

01:27:40
VICTORIA Right. 

01:27:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . and where he's coming from. 

01:27:40
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:27:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Could you, uhm, could you do a little experiment with me and kind of really try to go back there in that, ah, time where you were sitting on the dock with your dad and try to fully, vividly experience that moment where you were able to just let go of the comments and be this understanding, playful person. Could you--sometimes people close their eyes and sometimes people keep them open. That's totally up to you. But let's, let's try to, to go back there. So I'm imaging you sitting on the dock with your dad beside you. And you're feeding the fish, he's feeding the fish, and you're taking pictures and, uhm, and that comments come out. Uhm, and it sounds like there is maybe a little sting at first. Ah, and then you made a choice of, ah, of letting it go. And, ah, not focusing on the comment, to just remember that your dad was just being a dad, that it's no big deal. Uhm, that he's just worried and he's getting older, and he's retired, and staying connected with the fact that he moves slower now. And you still enjoy seeing him enjoy things. 

01:29:05
The interview drifts into practices of embodying the preferred self which at that time seemed beneficial for Victoria. Because of space limitations these ideas are discussed in the Neurobiology and Therapy video. 

01:29:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And you become understanding, another--an understanding person who has different view of him, different view of the comments and a different view of the situation. 

01:29:30
[sil.] 

01:29:30
After dwelling on the experience of the preferred self, and finding a metaphor illustrating the state (a bird), the client is invited to contrast the skillful response with the avoided problem reaction, and examine the rippling effects of her choice. 

01:29:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uhm, could you say a couple of words of what would have happened if you hadn't made that choice, if you had gone into the not-good-enough place, uhm, and responded with hurt and, ah, frustration. What would have happened with that special time with your dad? 

01:30:00
VICTORIA We wouldn't have that moment. 

01:30:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:30:05
VICTORIA We wouldn't have that time. I would have said something very mean . . . 

01:30:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:30:15
VICTORIA . . . rude, and he would have also responded back. 

01:30:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:30:20
VICTORIA And we get in this big argument and it could have been, could have been avoided. 

01:30:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. Uh-huh. 

01:30:30
VICTORIA Uhm . . . 

01:30:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Do you have regrets sometimes when you fall into those arguments with your dad? 

01:30:35
VICTORIA Oh yeah. 

01:30:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So there's regret afterwards. Regrets that linger? 

01:30:45
VICTORIA Yeah, for--depending on how big the fight is. 

01:30:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Right, right. And instead of going there, it sounds like you were able to go with that other part which is more understanding and confident. Did this sense of confidence and being relaxed and being like a bird was able to let go, did that stay with you? 

01:31:05
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:31:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? What happened after, after you left your dad? Did the good feeling stay inside of you? 

01:31:10
VICTORIA It did. 

01:31:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah? 

01:31:10
VICTORIA Yeah, it did. Yeah, that, that was nice. 

01:31:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Can you say a little bit more about what you did differently with that good feeling? 

01:31:20
VICTORIA Uhm, well I was in a good mood. 

01:31:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:31:25
VICTORIA Uhm, I drove home feeling better . . . 

01:31:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:31:25
VICTORIA . . . about myself, feeling--I don't feel--I took my time going home. 

01:31:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:31:35
VICTORIA I usually rush to, to leave. 

01:31:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. 

01:31:40
VICTORIA Uhm, I felt more at peace. 

01:31:50
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:31:50
VICTORIA It's just when we argue, I don't. And I let that affect me on my drive home. 

01:32:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Hmm. 

01:32:00
VICTORIA But because we had a really nice evening together, uhm, I felt much better. I feel--I feel more at peace. Yeah. 

01:32:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Felt more at peace. Uh-huh. And that peace stayed with you for some time? 

01:32:20
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:32:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. And did it affect how you treated your boyfriend? 

01:32:25
VICTORIA Oh, yeah. I was in a good mood. 

01:32:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN You were in a good mood? 

01:32:25
Effects/luggage 

01:32:25
VICTORIA I was in a good mood. Ah yeah. I didn't have to talk about it . . . 

01:32:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:32:30
VICTORIA . . . or mention it. Uh-huh. 

01:32:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Okay. So we're going to wrap us. Let me summarize some of the things that we've talked about today. Uhm, so if I was to draw an outline of your brain, so it sounds like when there's a, a critical comment that comes from your dad's upbringing and cultural background and some of his belief system, it triggers that not-good-enough feeling, which is also associated with, ah, doubt. And it's almost like a, a highway in your brain, right? It's like a program running in your brain. And the doubt makes you tempted to yell or it makes you, uhm, go away like when you went and run an errand. The doubt makes you not feel good about yourself for a few days, yeah? 

01:33:25
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:33:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN And it makes you take it out on your boyfriend sometimes. It makes you, uhm, lose, uhm, your confidence, have trouble sleeping. It can make you cry. It can make you anxious. And, ah, uhm, and sometimes lose your appetite. Yeah. And then it also leads to interactions with your dad that you don't like and some regrets later on. So that's like a, a not-good-enough program in your brain. It sounds like sometimes you're able to do something different with the situation. You're able to make the choice of just letting go. And, uhm, you let go. You kind of focus on something else. And we talked about how, uhm, let me see. You focus on something else and you remind yourself that your dad is just being a dad in his own way. And, uhm, that he's worried. Uhm, and that he's getting older and he's retired. And you see him differently. You see him as being slower. Would you say that you see a bit more of him when compared to how you see him when he makes those comments? 

01:35:00
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:35:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Does the other you include more of the kind of person he can be as opposed to just seeing, zooming in on that comment. 

01:35:05
VICTORIA Who he really is. Yeah. What he's really about. Yeah. 

01:35:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So you see what he's really about? 

01:35:15
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:35:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:35:15
VICTORIA Instead of being defensive or feeling like he's out to get me. 

01:35:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:35:20
VICTORIA He's really not. 

01:35:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:35:20
VICTORIA You know, he's--it's his way of showing that he loves me. He just doesn't communicate it the way that I'd like him to communicate it. 

01:35:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. So it's his way, his way of showing that he loves you. Yeah. And, ah, yeah. And, uhm, then you become more understanding and playful with him. And you even make jokes about him. 

01:35:50
VICTORIA Uh-huh. 

01:35:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:35:55
VICTORIA I would like to dwell on that more, yes. 

01:35:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yes, how do you imagine yourself doing this? 

01:36:00
VICTORIA Think about, think about all the things that you just mentioned. 

01:36:05
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:36:05
VICTORIA Think about taking myself back to, uhm, the forest, the lake. 

01:36:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:36:15
VICTORIA The letting go. 

01:36:15
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And to kind of dwell and really vividly feel . . 

01:36:20
VICTORIA See it and feel it, uhm . . . 

01:36:25
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . inside of you. 

01:36:25
VICTORIA And remember it. 

01:36:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:36:30
VICTORIA And be in it. 

01:36:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:36:30
VICTORIA In the moment of that. 

01:36:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:36:30
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:36:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. To be fair enough right. We spend so much time with the other program. 

01:36:40
VICTORIA Right. 

01:36:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN May as well . . . 

01:36:40
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:36:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . spend time with those more satisfying experiences. 

01:36:45
VICTORIA Yeah, more. 

01:36:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN What difference might that make in the future if you're able to hold onto those nicer memories of your interactions in that particular experience of yourself? 

01:36:55
VICTORIA I don't feel so pressure on myself and so much stress. 

01:36:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Hmm. 

01:36:55
VICTORIA And just stress really. 

01:37:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:00
VICTORIA Anxiety and the feeling of that I am good enough. 

01:37:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:10
VICTORIA That I am enough then. 

01:37:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:10
VICTORIA This is my life and . . . 

01:37:10
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:15
VICTORIA . . . there's nothing, there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing. 

01:37:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:20
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN So when you're able to kind of, ah, dwell more on those nicer moments and, and, and see him differently and see yourself as understanding and playful . . . 

01:37:30
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:37:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . you're able to get that place of feeling . . . 

01:37:30
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:37:30
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN . . . that you are good enough. 

01:37:30
VICTORIA Right. Because he sees my life a certain way that he wants. 

01:37:35
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. 

01:37:40
VICTORIA But that's his vision and I have to respect that. 

01:37:40
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Right. 

01:37:40
VICTORIA But the way I see my life is the way I want it. 

01:37:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:45
VICTORIA And I'm okay with that. 

01:37:45
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. 

01:37:45
VICTORIA And so I just need to make sure that I understand, uhm, the difference, to remind myself. 

01:37:55
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So you might leave with that feeling of feeling like you are good enough? 

01:38:00
VICTORIA Yeah. 

01:38:00
MARIE-NATHALIE BEAUDOIN Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. 

01:38:05
VICTORIA Thank you. 

01:38:10

Further therapeutic conversations connect these experiences with her values of autonomy and independence, and other experiences of responding in calm/confident ways to unsatisfactory comments.
