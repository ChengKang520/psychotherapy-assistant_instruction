MELANIE BREWSTER All right. Hi, everybody. I'm glad to see at least some of you made it here despite all the weather. Um, I'm Melanie Brewster[ph], I'm a counseling psychology faculty member here at Teachers College and I'm thrilled to be able to introduce doctor Tania Israel. She is truly a momentous figure in counseling and psychology and one of my personal role models, so I was very excited to get to introduce her. Um, Dr. Israel is an associate professor of counseling and clinical and school psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She's a fellow of the American Psychological Association, past president of the Society of Counseling Psychology or Division 17, and recipient of a five year career development grant from M.I.M.H. Um, some of her other honors include the Asian and Pacific, um, Islander Heritage Award for excellence in mental health, the emerging leader award from the A.P.A. Committee on Women in Psychology, the Division 17 Section for the Advancement of Women 2011 Woman of the Year Award, and the Division 17 Section for L.G.B.T. Cue Issues Award for significant contribution to social justice and advocacy. Her research focuses on the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals and communities, privilege and oppression, intersections among gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation and social justice. Please join me in extending a warm welcome to doctor Tania Israel.

DR. TANIA ISRAEL Thank you so much. I'm delighted to be here and thank you, Melanie. Melanie's a total early career rock star so I'm just humbled to think that I'm one of her role models. Um, I hope I can live up to that. Um, so, I thought I would do a little bit of storytelling today and, and we've been, uh, you know, sort of centered on a journey that I've taken, uh, in terms of, uh, being a social justice advocate. And we've been in, uh, several different research projects and some advocacy efforts and, uh, take you along on that journey. Uh, one of the things I'm really interested in is, uh, within counseling and psychology in particular, you know, how do we bring our skills and our expertise to bear in terms of social justice advocacy. And so I'll tell you my story and then I'm hoping I'll have some time at the end to think about what your stories are like, uh, in that regard. So, here we go. Uh, when I started out in a faculty position, um, I formed research teams and we would sit around in my research office coming up with projects, um, and we would carry them out and most of what we were doing focused on counseling L.G.B.T. clients. So it was, you know, doing something for marginalized communities but it was very much, you know, people talk about this research lab language and, and I always say, you know, now, like, the, the world is my lab. You know, that I, that I sort of hate that lab term. But yeah, that's sort of how I started. You know, we'd be on these teams and we'd do this stuff and then I kind of hit, uh, a turning point and there were a few different things that brought me to that. Um, one was that I, uh, was co-editing the handbook for social justice in counseling psychology and this was a tremendous experience because I got to read these chapters, uh, from all these people who are doing this incredible community-based participatory research and all these wonderful projects and they were completely consistent with where my heart was, um, but I realized that they weren't at all consistent with what I was actually doing in terms of community-based work and social justice advocacy. Uh, I was also, I had a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health and it was a career development award. And one of the things that the funders, uh, do is try to communicate to the researchers what they're interested in funding and what their priorities are. So they were communicating pretty strongly at that point. They were really interested in, of all things, community-based participatory research. And I never thought that I would be getting a nudge from, you know, like, federal funding agencies to be doing, uh, community-based research and I thought, okay. Well that's kind of cool. I should, you know, sort of follow that if I can. And so, so this really brought me into doing C.B.P.R., or community-based participatory research. I was also at the time a sort of, another part of my life, getting involved in some community activism and, uh, and campaign work and so that really also engaged me and my community in different ways than I, than I had before. So, so all of these things kind of shifted me a little bit and I came together with a couple of individuals in my community. I, I was collaborating with, um, a colleague and friend of mine in feminist studies, uh, at U.C.S.B. named Lori Oaks and we went to the local L.G.B.T. service agency and said, we're really interested in doing something based in the community. And they said, what. And we said, no, no. You tell us. So, we started this whole dialogue about, like, what are we gonna do and how are we gonna do it. And so David Selburg and Mary Ellen Maureen[ph], um, we, we started having these conversations. So, first we sort of brought in, you know, we, we sent out a call and said, okay, we want to do something on L.G.B.T., um, issues and, you know, sort of mental health or psychological well-being really broadly defined. And the people who showed up in the room were what we, who, who identified themselves as the professional queers. You know, that these are the people who, sort of, for their living, they're doing something related to L.G.B.T. issues and, so they were there and we thought, well this is great. We want to have a conversation with you all, but we also want to have a conversation with people who are just L.G.B.T.Q. people in the community and how do we find them. So we ended up sort of working together to develop a partnership council and identify the individuals and organizations and constituencies who should be represented on that council. And, uh, we came up with a project that had, um, a couple of goals. Um, one was to develop collaboration among community members, researchers and service providers. So that was really the first idea that we were gonna work in collaboration. Also that we would identify and address issues of concern to L.G.B.T. individuals on the central coast. That's how we talk about where we are in California. We're not L.A. We're not San Francisco. We're everything in between on the coast. Um, then we wanted to investigate L.G.B.T. individuals' perceptions of local L.G.B.T. communities. So this is really something that came from the community. We said, what do you want to know. And they said, well, okay. We live in Santa Barbara County and remarkably, in Santa Barbara County, there is not a single gay bar, gay bookstore, um, uh, community center. We're just sort of devoid of gathering spaces, and therefore visibility. And, so, you know, people said, we wanna know what do people, L.G.B.T. people, think of their own community here. And, uh, thank you, um, and, a little name tag crisis. I'm having an identity crisis here today. So, um, so, so they said they really wanna know what community members think of their own community here. And we're like, oh, okay. That's something we can find out, um, and it has some relationship to psychology in a way and so we can justify putting our efforts into that and it's what the community wants. So we started out by doing a survey. And, uh, for the survey we had, um, almost 300 people who took an online survey and, uh, another 76 people took it on, uh, paper and we had both an English language version and a Spanish language version and we had a few people take the Spanish language version. So we asked about a number of things. Psychological sense of community, community participation, social interaction and support, where do people go do socialize when there's no gay bar, um, what do you people, where do people go for information and asked how they would describe the local community and then we wanted to know about community priorities, because we really thought we wanna not just find out things, but we wanna think about how to take this into action. So that was part of the community priorities. And so we did this survey and, and we got data, and so that was very exciting for me. It's like, okay, now we know something and what we wanted to do was then share it back with the community and do some collaborative interpretation of the data. So we held these community gatherings, um, and we brought people together, first, I'll first of all say, um, uh, we had some of these gatherings where we would target different regions of the area. And we would have some that we would target different sub-populations, and then we would have some that would just be open. And so for each of these we did 10 different groups and we had, um, an organization come in and sort of do the design and facilitation of what these groups would look like. So, because as researchers we kind of want to start out by, like, okay, here's what we found. And they said, well, no. Let's start where people are and let's do a journaling worksheet, we did this thing with passion words like what, what's the word that really, um, represents, um, if you had a really healthy vibrant L.G.B.T. community like what would the words be that would represent that. Um, we shared survey results in little chunks. We said, here's, here's one thing we found. Um, and then we would ask, you know, what resonates for you about that, what'd we get wrong, what did we miss, and while we were doing all of this, we had graduate students with their laptops madly scribing everything that they could from these conversations. Um, and so we also asked for input to, to, um, interpret what we were finding. Those were some of the questions that we asked. And so we really got a lot of good input from people about that and discovered, you know, the survey found some important things, but we really needed to have some conversation to move things a little bit farther in terms of the depth of what we could find and making sense of some of the results. And so I thought I'd share with you, um, oh, and also, we asked about taking action on priorities. We said, what resources do you need in order to actually take action on these priorities and, um, what kind of support, um, you know, do you already have to do this and so trying to really figure out some things about an action plan to move things forward. This is the passion word cloud, um, that we came up with of all the passion words that all of the groups came up with here. Here are some of the, the things that really represented community for them. Uh, so based on the survey and based on the results. So we're working together with this partnership council, um, that we had developed, uh, with, with people representing, uh, local L.G.B.T. communities and, um, and organizations and, you know, they, they were sort of like, okay, you know, we're, we're not really sure what we're doing here, you know. But we wanna help and we wanna do something. So one of the great things that they did is that they kept sort of bringing things back to, like, okay, what's the, you know, what's the key message here. What should we be taking away from this and how do we bring this to the community. So, so, we came up with really, there were three things that were standing out from the survey and, uh, from the community meetings, um, in terms of priorities for community action. So the first one was we need social spaces and events. We need places we can gather and ways to talk to people. We recognize that local L.G.B.T., the local L.G.B.T. agency has to do fundraisers, but we also need things that are free. We need things where, they're, that's al-, that are alcohol free. We need things that, you know, can have a range of ages for people. And so there were a lot of different kinds of needs that, that people were identifying. They said, there's a lot of diversity within L.G.B.T.Q. communities and that we need to, um, be able to be inclusive across those different, um, ages, across different ethnic backgrounds. We've got people who are, um, you know, immigrant status and undocumented and people who are not. We have, there's major, uh, S.E.S., socioeconomic status, uh, differences and so there's all kinds of different things and, and also, um, there's the sort of L.G.B. and then the T parts of the community. And within the T we've got the sort of, you know, there's some definite generational differences we're seeing there. So they're like, how do we bring everyone together. And then the actual number one priority that they did, that, that the community identified was safety from harassment, violence and discrimination. And this was so interesting to us because when we looked at how people were describing community, they, uh, did not describe it as being an incredibly unsafe place. But this was the number one priority and so we're like, all right. We'll want to pay attention to this. So we ended up then bringing these, um, priorities to an event that we called the L.G.B.T. Summit. And it was a regional summit and, yes, you're like, what do we want. Evidence-based change. When do we want it. After peer review. Uh, so, yes. As researchers, you know, we need to go through all the research stuff but then we said, okay. Now we've got some results. Let's move this into action and let's bring this to the community. The other thing was, frankly, the project had run out of money and so we couldn't carry the ball much farther ourselves and we're like, we wanna bring this to the community and see where people can help to pick up the ball and, and run with some things. Um, and, so this summit, it was, there were two different locations within the county. We were teleconferenced across these locations. We were presenting stuff, we had facilitators at each of them to work on sort of work groups focusing on sort of each of these areas. It was, it was a major undertaking and it was so exciting, um, about a hundred people showed up. It was a rainy day which, I know, you all are dealing with all this snow. We're in Santa Barbara. Um, we're a little bit namby-pamby about weather. And, so, uh, so we're like, wow. It's raining and people still showed up on a Saturday. So that was fantastic. Um, and so we, um, so, so we also realized that again, you know, as we're presenting the research we don't wanna be too researcher-y. And this is one of the things that I really learned about community-based participatory research, is how to, as a researcher, be able to connect with community. I, I would actually do things with my research team. We had, um, a game that we would play called, like, research taboo. You know that game Taboo, where there's like a word, like you're trying to get somebody to guess the word apple and you can't say red, and you can't say fruit. And so I was like, okay, how are we going to talk about our research without saying data, or participants, or you know, I said, like, let's take all of that language out of it. And, so, one of the things that, that we brought to it was just trying to also, you know, be able to connect and be able to be a little bit light-hearted. And, uh, so one of the ways that I tend to do that in my life is I write songs. And so I decided that I would share this song with you that we actually sang at the summit. I'll only share it if you sing along. How many people will sing along with me. Okay. Awesome. Good. All right. I think that you know the tune, um, if you remember the group the Village People. They had a great song called Y.M.C.A. Um, and so this is to the tune of Y.M.C.A. Okay, so everybody, get ready. Let's do it. Here in Santa Barbara County, there are people who are L.G.B.T. We want safety and diversity. Need a space so we aren't lonely. We're gonna change it with C.B.P.R. We'll be empowered with C.B.P.R. We'll promote leadership in the community with education and visibility. Let's all hear it for C.B.P.R. Now we're all a part of C.B.P.R. All right, give yourselves a hand. That was awesome. Sorry. I should've had Nathan come up here with me to do this, because he was doing the letters. Um, anyway, so, so one of the lessons about moving into the community was trying to be accessible as a researcher and, and trying to, um, talk to people about and communicate about things in ways that didn't, didn't put people off. So this was, this was a great, um, way to break the ice a little bit. So, what came out of all of that. Well, the next phase of this was that the director of the L.G.B.T. agency went to the chief of police, who he had a pretty good relationship with. They had been having communication and said, the number one priority of our community is safety from harassment and violence. And this is when the miracle happened, because the chief of police said, oh, okay. I will mandate a five-hour training for every sworn officer in the city of Santa Barbara on L.G.B.T. issues. That was incredible. Um, that I've never heard of any, any kind of, um, powerful institutional response happen like that within law enforcement that's not in response to an incident. It wasn't that anyone was saying that the police were doing a terrible job. It's not that there was something, a public thing that happened. But that the community, and this is, um, where I think, we have some real power as researchers, um, because we can collect the data and without some terrible thing happening, we can identify a need and we can move, uh, things forward to that need. So, uh, so then, you know, they said to me, Tania, do you want to be involved in this. And I was like, yes. This is why I'm a researcher. So that I can do things like this. So I was so excited, um, to work on designing this training. So, and there are a lot of reasons, okay, and I gotta tell you, I didn't really know much about law enforcement. Like, you know, I watched Charlie's Angels when I was growing up and, you know, they all went to the police academy but then they quit. So I, I didn't really know a lot about police. Um, so, so I started, you know, looking at the research and my research team started looking at it and discovering that there are some significant barriers to L.G.B.T.Q. people, uh, uh, reporting crimes. And, so, they don't trust law enforcement. And part of this, if you don't know about the whole history of, um, bar raids. You know, police used to raid gay bars on a regular basis and this was in, you know, the 1950's and the sixties when it was illegal, you know, to, for L.G.B.T. people to gather and to socialize together and it was horribly embarrassing. Of course, this is when homosexuality was considered a psychological, um, illness, and so, this was, you know, so that there was a real conflict between police and, and, um, L.G.B.T. people. And so, you know, the police would, would, you know, would be, um, the, the stigma of it, of the bar raids and really being publicly humiliated was, was tremendous in the threat of that. And so there's sort of a historical community of mistrust in law enforcement. And, in fact, the, um, beginning of the L.G.B.T. rights movement is considered to be the Stonewall Riots and that's when, right here in New York, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, um, the police tried to raid the bar and the patrons of the bar fought back for days and actually it was led by the drag queens, um, right out in front. And so, so, the, the, the emblem of the L.G.B.T. rights movement is fighting back against police. So you can see why there's some historical conflict there that would have to be overcome. There are also fears of secondary discrimination from law enforcement. So you're a victim of a hate crime and you go to police and you're worried that they're not gonna believe you, that they're going to, you know, minimize things, and, um, and in fact, there's some reluctance on the part of law enforcement to note anti-L.G.B.T. aspects of a reported crime so that there's some truth in those fears. And there's a failure of law enforcement to take the reported crime seriously. So these are some of the experiences that L.G.B.T.Q. people have. And, um, people, L.G.B.T. people who report, uh, crime frequently describe law enforcement as indifferent, um, and so that suggests that they don't really take the issues at hand seriously. And so that indifference, it may not be, you know, a negative response per se, but just a, a lack of caring. So what we started out doing was going to these, um, briefings, um, by the police. And by we, I mean, I was working in collaboration with the L.G.B.T. agency and also this organization in our community that does a lot of training on equity and diversity issues and they're very, very good at sort of design and facilitation of, of trainings. So we went to the police briefings and we said, you're gonna have a five hour training on L.G.B.T. issues and here's a little bit of, you know, why, why that is, but, um, what do you want to know about. What kinds of questions do you have, what kinds of situations do you encounter that you would like to know more about. And, one, we heard actually a lot about, um, we don't know how to deal with transgender people. That was one of the things that came up a lot. But the other question that came up repeatedly was, what does the L.G.B.T.Q. community think of us. Like, I don't think I'm biased, but I feel like people act as if I'm biased. People assume that I'm biased. So what do they think of us. And I was like, I don't know. But I'm a researcher so I can find out. So, so then we went to the community and we said, okay, we, now, now we wanna gather some data to help to design the training. And this is, like, you know, if you've ever done, like, you know, research under the gun, it's like, all right. We're doing these briefings in August and we know that in November they're going to start doing the trainings, and so somehow we have to gath-, we have to get the I.R.B. approval, design the survey, gather and analyze the data in time to design the training around it. Um, this is great. So, um, so we did this survey in the community of L.G.B.T. perceptions of and experiences with law enforcement. So it was, again, online and paper version, we recruited people. We and we had just done our survey, well, okay. This all sounds like it happened really fast, but, like, that first part, like, from, you know, the, the beginning of the project in to the, the, um, the summit, that was about three, three and a half years. So this had all been going on a long time. But still, we had already done a survey in the community and so, we're like, okay, we know how to get a survey out there. We asked people about their feelings of safety, their experiences of personal and community victimization, their perceptions of, of, law enforcement personnel, that's L.E.P., and also we asked an open-ended question. Um, uh, tell us about a positive experiences, experience you've had with local law enforcement. What made it positive. Tell us about a negative experience you had and what made it negative. We got so much rich data from that. And I'll share it with you. So some of the key things that we found. First we found that L.G.B.T.Q. people feel that their community is vulnerable. Um, but, and actually, you know, in terms of their community feeling vulnerable, one of the things we found is people didn't necessarily feel like they were in personal, physical danger. But they did sometimes feel, uh, more vulnerable emotionally. They felt sort of lack of emotional safety. But even more so they felt concerns about other people in the community. So they knew someone personally who had been a victim of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment, violence, discrimination, and most people actually knew multiple people who were in that situation. So it wasn't necessarily, and that's why, when we ask for the descriptions of it, um, in the earlier study, we didn't find that people were saying it's a really unsafe community for themselves, but it was really more for other people. They also had really varied experiences with law enforcement personnel. And so those, those varied experiences, um, were both in terms of how they were encountering law enforcement personnel, so sometimes it was because they were a victim of a crime, but someti-, but, a lot of the time, uh, it's 'cause they were stopped for getting a ticket, um, you know, they, they had, you know, encounters on the, you know, on the perpetrator side or on the law-breaker side of things. Um, and then, but also sometimes people were collaborating with law enforcement on things. They had a friend who was a police officer. So there are a lot of different ways, or they had even observed something in terms of law enforcement, uh, um, going to, you know, provide, uh, services at an L.G.B.T.Q. event. Um, so that there were a lot of different ways that people, um, developed their perceptions of law enforcement. Um, one of the key things that we found is that demeanor is so important. Just whether or not, uh, a police officer was warm made a huge difference and so that really came across. Um, in terms of, so in terms of positive experiences, that was actually the top of what we found, was that law enforcement personnel were pleasant to deal with. That was so much of what made something positive. Also just that they did their job. An then third, was that they were sensitive or responsive to sexual orientation or gender identity. So that was interesting, because usually when we think about, how do you deal with, you know, L.G.B.T. people, you think, oh, you have to be responsive to their sexual orientation or gender identity. And what we were finding is no, you, you just have to be nice. Um, you have to warm. And interestingly, and the research that I, that I've done around counseling L.G.B.T. clients, it's the same thing. It's not even so much about how mental health professionals are responding to sexual orientation or gender identity, but just that warmth, and, you know, that therapeutic relationship. We know that's important. It may be particularly important with people who've, who are from historically marginalized community, too, that we have to make a special effort to be warm and develop that relationship. Uh, so what we found with negative experiences were, first of all, that law enforcement personnel abused their power. Okay, well, that seems like an obviously negative thing. Um, but then demeanor was, was up there, too. That they were difficult or unpleasant to deal with. And then, after that, again, was the response to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, that they exhibited homo-negative or trans-negative attitudes or behavior. Then they didn't do their job. They exhibited, um, negative attitudes or behavior toward other marginalized communities. This was also something really interesting that I hadn't, um, expected to find necessarily. But that people talked about negative experiences based on, um, I don't like what I see law enforcement doing with youth, with Latino, uh, people in our community, and with homeless people in our community. And so all of those came up so it, you know, L.G.B.T. people may be sort of trying to get a read on law enforcement and noticing, you know, what they're doing with other marginalized communities as, as an idea of how safe am I going to be with them. There were also some people who were just like, I was really stressed out because I was getting a speeding ticket, you know. So, that, you know, didn't have anything to do with how law enforcement was behaving. Uh, so, let's see, we talked about those. Oh, so the public presence. Um, public presence is also important. So they, people did talk about, um, law enforcement personnel being at, you know, L.G.B.T.Q. events and that that could be a really positive thing. Or it could be a negative thing. Maybe they overhear um, law enforcement making a comment, um, about, about, um, uh, about something, a homophobic comment. But the other piece about their public presence had to do with witnessing public harassment. So we asked people, um, you know, do you witness sort of people being harassed publicly, L.G.B.T.Q. people. You know, people using verbal harassment primarily. And people said, yes, we do see that. And we said, okay. Well, when law enforcement personnel are present during those interactions, how often do they intervene. Never. Never is the mode. So, uh, about 40 percent said never and then some of the time was about 28 percent and most of the time about 10 percent. All of the time was about three percent of people said, oh, they always intervene. And then we looked at the relationship between their response to this and their perception of law enforcement. And if they said, you know, that law enforcement never intervened, that was a much more negative perception of law enforcement. So we thought, this is really interesting because this is something we can take to law enforcement and say, here's something you can do. And it can make a difference. So, I think I mentioned all of those. Yeah, I talked about the treatment of marginalized groups. So all, so all of those things we thought, this is great. Now we can use this information and really bring it back to, um, to the training. So we designed the training and we had then approximately 150 people officers and a few other law enforcement personnel in four different groups, so we, you know, they were, they were groups of about 35, uh, uh, people each. And it was a five hour training. The components, you know, we looked at the literature on effective law enforcement training and we tried to do all of that. We looked at, you know, what do experts say about, um, uh, training law enforcement. We tried to do all of these things. And so we, we were, we really did a thoughtful design about it. And what we ended up with was a training where we welcomed people, we got them engaged in thinking about their early messages about L.G.B.T. people. We, um, shared some data and historical facts. And one of the things is when we were designing the training we had some, some officers who, uh, were working with us on the design of the training. And so, which was very ool because we started out with, like, working with the one openly gay police officer in Santa Barbara. You know, there's one. And so he was working with us and that was great. But after we did the briefings, we had a couple other officers who said, hey, can I help with this. I'd be really interested in doing this, just because they had an interest in it. So, so we got to work with sort of a broader range of, of law enforcement. And one of the things they told us very clearly was, no death by PowerPoint. Right. Please don't make us sit through a five hour PowerPoint presentation. And so we said, okay, well how can we share information in a different way. So what we did is we took some of the local data as well as some national data about, um, law, about experiences of L.G.B.T. people, um, and we put it, you know, we printed it out on a piece of paper and we posted it around the room. So the gallery walk was, we, we asked people to go around and read these things around the room and then gather at one of them that, that really stood out to them and talk with the other people who are there. So it was a much more interactive way of sharing information and they were able to, you know, sort of own that conversation a little bit more. And then we had a little, sort of debrief about that. Um, we, we did a piece about developing a common language so just some sort of introduction to L.G.B.T.Q. issues. And then we did these scenarios. So this was great because we were able to take this from, you know, that open-ended question where I ask people about positive and negative experiences with law enforcement. We took some of those and we developed them into, uh, scenarios. And so, you know, you stop, uh, somebody for speeding and they hand you their ID and the ID says that they're a man but it looks like you're talking to a woman. Like, what do you do, like, like, okay. As a police officer you have to make sure that this is actually this person's ID but, like, what kinds of questions can you ask if you don't want to be offensive and you want to get the information you need. So this is one of the questions that they, they brought up actually during the briefings and then also they came up some in, in the surveys that we collected. So, so we did these different scenarios where, you know, you go to somebody's home and there's, you know, um, uh, possibly a domestic violence situation or, uh, there's some truant teenagers, and, and, um, and you're not sure if you should tell their parents that you found them and they were, you know, two girls and they were kissing in the park and they weren't at school. So, so what do you do with all these things. So, so we took all that and built scenarios around it and because we had this information about what mdd, um, a, a situation positive and what made it negative, we were able to bring that to them and say, okay. Here are the things that you can do that, well, first we said to come up with ideas and the great thing is they came up with a lot of those positive ideas about, like, what to do. Here are things that we can do in our role as law enforcement, because I don't know exactly what their protocols and procedures are that they have to follow. But they do. The great thing about the scenarios was as long as there was at least one person in the room that had that good idea, then it was coming from them. It wasn't us telling them what to do. And so I've really been thinking a lot about, you know, strength-based diversity training and how can we do that so that, so that we're really not just saying to people, here's what you should do but saying, here's what you're already doing well. And tell us what you can do, too. So that was great. It was, it was, um, they came up with lots of really fantastic ideas and we're actually analyzing the data from what they came up with now. Um, we provided them with local resources and we did some closure. And, so, I think it was a really effective training. And part of the way that I know that is we got to do an evaluation of it. So, this was again bringing the research piece in, both into the design of the training, but also we did an evaluation. So, um, we had pre and post test, uh, for this, for everybody. And we had a measure of knowledge about L.G.B.T. communities. A significant increase. Uh, we had a, a measure about interpersonal communication apprehension. That's, like, discomfort with L.G.B.T. people. And there was no change in that, but it seemed like there was a ceiling effect. Like, they already came into the training going, I'm, I'm comfortable. Um, we're not entirely sure that that's true on a deep down gut level all the time, but it's still what they were reporting. But, because of that, you know, there was a ceiling effect on that measure. We also asked about self-efficacy in implementing effective tactics with L.G.B.T. citizens. And when we say citizens, we don't mean, um, uh, we, we mean non-law enforcement people and that's, that's often what they mean. We don't mean people who are, um, U.S. citizens. So, um, so, we had sort of things that, you know, were coming from what law enforcement can do, you know, positive ways, um, like, like, listening, you know, to L.G.B.T. people, um, and, and taking seriously the anti-L.G.B.T. aspects of the crime. So we said, how confident do you feel in your ability to do these things and there was an increase, also, in the self-efficacy and so we were really excited to see that. We asked, we gave them a scenario and we said, you know, tell us what you would do to try to, you know, um, help this L.G.B.T. person and we thought that what we would, what we would see from that would be a little bit different, but people were not filling out things completely and so we ended up not really being able to analyze it in a pre post kind of way, but we're working with the data in a different way now. Um, the other thing is we asked, like, how relevant was this training to your work and, um, and how valuable do you think it was. And they all said, like, relevant and valuable, like, we had a really positive response from them. And I have to say, when we were, like, in the room with them, it wasn't always clear that we were gonna have a positive response because we got some push-back on a lot of things. Some of the people who pushed back the most were the ones who came up to us after the training and said, thank you so much. This was great. So, it was, um, uh, you know, uh, really, really reinforcing in terms of what we did. So we did this in December, in November and December of 2011. 2000 of a year. I think it was 2011. Uh, 2012. And then, um, then what happened in our community was that on New Year's Eve, um, that year, two men were attacked during, uh, New Year's Eve festivities as they left a bar, and, uh, they were holding hands and it was around one 45 in the morning. They were, um, the two victims were walking and they were confronted by three men they had never met. One of the suspects made a derogatory comment and the three proceeded to punch the victims. Um, one of the victims suffered a broken jaw and a severe head injury that required staples to close and the other escaped with only minor injuries. So we had a really public incident of a hate crime, uh, against, um, two men who were walking down the street holding hands. And this is why it's good to be proactive. The police response was amazing. There was a community gathering and press conference. The police were there in full force and they said pretty much exactly if we had scripted it for them, we couldn't have done any better. They said that this is, um, not acceptable. They said, two men were assaulted because of nothing they did wrong but because of who they were. And they said, we're aggressively investigating the case and we're very determined to make an arrest. Sadly they haven't made an arrest. Um, they, they didn't catch the perpetrators but the, um, the good news is that when people from the community were, like, why haven't they caught them, why haven't they caught them, um, the L.G.B.T. agency was able to say, we are working with them. They are doing everything that they can and here's how you can help, because we had a really good relationship at that point with, with the police department. And so it was amazing how the community came together with the police and that also that the community could feel assured that even though this one incident happened, that that didn't represent the way that the, um, uh, the officials were going to respond to it. So, it was, it was, um, a, a very good example of why it's important to do something before there's a public incident, why that training was so important in that way. So, that happened and, and the victims are also doing much better now, by the way. So, so, that's, you know, that's good. It was a terrible, terrible incident. But if there's any silver lining, it's that we had actually gotten law enforcement really well-prepared for that. So what happened from there. So I, you know, have taken you to, you know, starting to do community-based research and then getting to do some local action and training on all of this. Well, what happened after this is that there's this thing going on with the violence against women act. Um, and, and I got an email that said, you know, would you be willing to present at a congressional briefing on the violence against women act. And I said, well, I'm really flattered but I don't actually do research on violence against women. And, so then they said, well, actually though, the violence against women act reauthorization is getting held up in congress, um, to some extent because they've added in language now about L.G.B.T. people and about services for L.G.B.T. people and we really need someone who can speak to the preparation of mental health professionals and law enforcement on working with L.G.B.T. communities and I was like, oh wow. That's actually now exactly what I do. And so I was able, the, the society for the psychological study of social issues put together this panel of, um, people who were doing research that was relevant to some of those things that were hold, that was holding up, um, the violence against women act and authorization. So including, um, issues around, um, minority women, around immigrants. And, so, I got to go present at a congressional briefing, which was amazing. Um, so, again as a researcher, I can't think of anything better to do with my research than to influence policy that's gonna have far-reaching effects in terms of resources, um, for a broad range of people. So that was incredibly exciting. Um, and then, like, a week after we did this briefing they passed the violence against women act and I really do not take very much credit for that because a lot of people were working on that. But it was thrilling to be a part of that and to be able to share that, um, uh, with, and it was mostly, and people are like, oh, you know, where you televise it. It wasn't one of those. It was, it was, you know, in a, um, it was a briefing primarily for staffers. But, of course, the staffers are the ones who then inform the elected on things. So, it was an exciting moment. So that's how I went from this, like, sort of research lab into the community to be able to do this action and really integrate it with my research and then bring it to a policy level, as well. So that's how I, that's how I got to congress. Um, so, so that's my story. What I'm really curious about right now is how does this fit for you. I thought we could do a, I like doing (inaudible ) stuff. I thought we could do a little pair share where you could talk to each other and then we could share together. But I'm curious, like, which one of these reactions you might be having. Um, you know, nice story but are you sacrificing rigor and research productivity for advocacy. Took a long time for you to do that very first survey. Um, C.B.P.R. and advocacy don't really fit my research agenda or my personality. Is that how you're feeling. Are you feeling like, I'm interested in C.B.P.R. and advocacy but I don't know how to do it. Are you feeling, like, yeah. I feel completely affirmed in my path to do C.B.P.R. and community advocacy. Or is there some other reaction that you're having. So find somebody next to you, like, in two's or three's to talk to and, and share where you are and then I'll bring us back together so I can hear about what people are thinking. So, so how do you know, like, if you've got a client who's having an encounter with law enforcement, like, is this something with my client. Is this law enforcement colliding. So, I've been thinking two things with the law enforcement. It's like, we did this training for law enforcement. what we hard from law enforcement also is they said, well, are you doing training for the L.G.B.T. community like us. And we're like, uh, no. We hadn't though about it, but actually I learned so much about law enforcement by being in there in that training and working with them that I've been sharing a lot of words with L.G.B.T. people. Because I was a little bit naive when I walked in and I was like, oh, law enforcement. They just need to know about the vulnerability with L.G.B.T. people and that whole history of stone walls up. And then they'll know that any time they walk into a situation, they should just be like, like kind and friendly and explain everything like what they're doing to people and then they'll put people at ease. Um, apparently they can't. They can't do all that. Um, like, they don't have time to do all that. Whenever they're entering a situation, they actually have to enter that situation as if it could be, like, a volatile situation because they don't know what it is. They, one, one police officer explained it to me in this way. He said, you know, any time there's a situation in our community that people are running away from, we're running toward it. Right. So they've got to have that mindset to some extent going in. And so it was helpful for me to be able to say to L.G.B.T.Q. people, um, you know, this is something that they have to do. They sometimes have to have this demeanor and have to ask questions in a certain way. Um, but know that they've all had this training, um, that, that they were really open to it. You know. And so, just keep them assured about that. That helped. So I think part of it is, if you are in a marginalized community that, that has been targeted by law enforcement in the past and sometimes still the present, um, then, then you might sort of read every police officer or every law enforcement person as, um, as, you know, being part of this problem. But I guess that's the other thing that I am saying is that we also do this stereotyping in in our own, you know, in certain ways. And so, I think it's a little bit of both. Trying to help law enforcement understand things and also trying to help L.G.B.T.Q. people understand things. I don't know if that answers your question. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN You know, I guess I was struggling with, um, I think especially a lot of times with, um, training, we get, um, into research and specifically it turns into a one track mind about what research is, what it looks like and how you do it. So this is really hard. (Inaudible) category. It's really hard to think about things that change and the way that we're conducting research and the way that it looks and meets, you know, different styles. 

00:44:20
DR. TANIA ISRAEL And, and I think that we need a variety of different types of research that we're doing. I like to think that if everybody in our field turned around and started doing community-based, you know, advocacy research that that wouldn't necessarily be a good thing. Because we still need people who are, you know, doing, you know, the lab-based experimental mindsets. We need people who are doing surveys and people who are doing political research. There's a lot of different, you know, approaches and we need all of them. Um, so I think, what I hope is, you know, that we can open out and, and honor the kind of work, this kind of work, because I know the work gets honored in other kinds of worlds sometimes. Yes. Thanks. Other reactions. Hi. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN I loved your presentation, as always. You really lived up to your rock star role model status. Um, I think this would be a great teaching tool for research courses. Particularly there have been a lot of students who want more advocacy-based research kinds of methods. Have you written this up, and not just the findings, but really a piece about the message and how you were funded along the way but you were very successful in this method at various points. I think it'd be very useful for, if you felt it. 

00:45:35
DR. TANIA ISRAEL I'm revising and resubmitting it right now. Thank you, though. Good, good. I'll let you know when it's out. Other reactions, thoughts, questions. Okay, I'm going to ask. How many people would say that their reaction is A. Okay. How about B. A little bit. Okay. C. Okay. Um, D. And E. Okay, great. Anyone want to say more about the other. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN The challenge that I've experienced was, like, at certain points actually working with someone on, on the staff. And also, you know, recognizing it's more than just being able to, uh, be in the position to do research and the organization of it all. Most of the individuals are really struggling around the issues and documentation. And so I guess, what I would really curious about is, like, how do I keep that process going and especially with the, with the group of those who are really struggling in their daily lives, um, and really want to make sure that their voice is heard. And really, not just heard but sort of centralized and at the same time, doing the research is, yeah. 

00:46:50
DR. TANIA ISRAEL That's such a great question. Like, how do you work for community agencies when they don't have the resources and the staff time to be able to be, I mean, you know, the, it's hard for them to be sort of equal partners in all of this. And so what ends up happening is, like, we took on a lot of the burden of, you know, um, funding stuff. Uh, but also a lot of the administrative part. You know. So, so when I was building a research team, you know, of students, and so they, they would be, you know, coordinating partnership council meetings which, ideally, a community agency would do since they have the relationships there. Um, but there was just no way for them to do that. In fact, yesterday I got a call from the director of the agency saying, oh, people in the lists were wrong. Why didn't you know about the training. And I'm really bad at responding to emails so I'm like, overwhelmed. I am though. I'm terrible at it. But the reason he said it was he said, can I get on your email address so they can contact you. So, some of it is saying, you know, we've got to take on some of that work load in a, in an in-house way. Um, if we have resources and not just money resources, but also just personnel resources to do that. And, um, if, it would, it would be great to, I mean, what I was trying to do also was see funding that could also help to support, you know, some of the, and there, there, there is a program announced in N.I.H. for community-based participatory research. So don't feel like you can't get federal funding for this. Um, uh, but I didn't. Okay, that's a lie. But, but, but the idea of those, of those grants is you can actually, um, support the community agency and the researchers. I know that there's, uh, everybody's got to go to their next thing so I just wanted to say thank you so much and thanks for listening.
