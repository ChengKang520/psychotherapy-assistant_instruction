INTRODUCTION TO SHOMARHI 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  You're gonna find that Shomarhi, a very bright and able eight-year-old is able to discuss issues on the playground at the sensory motor, the concrete, the formal and at the dialectic systemic level. You're going to see some beginnings of multi-spectival thinking from an eight-year-old child and it's important to realize that metaphors, at least, of very complex thinking exist in young children. Now on this tape, what I've asked Shomarhi to do is to role-play a child that has play, problems on the playground. And you're not gonna see that part of the tape. Ah, let us imagine though that Shomarhi has come in to meet for counseling, has talked about problems on the playground. One thing I find very, very useful in working with a child with this problem is go through the problem but then also spend a fair amount of time focusing on positive strengths. And in this tape, I focused on the strength that Shomarhi has which she then can later take to her problems of relationships on the playground. So we'll keep in mind that Shomarhi is role-playing because this is obviously a child, who had not have a great deal of interpersonal problems. But notice how we can use the DC course, DCT questioning series with children. Shomarhi goes to it very quickly. I also want to say that Mary has found that you can take children who may not, who really frankly are not quite as, as, ah, intellectually acute as Shomarhi and still they can go through this levels of thinking. It does take indeed a bit more time. Shomarhi's obviously an exception, but we need short tapes. Uh, and, by the way, even with Shomarhi this is the fifth take, so it didn't happen the first time. But these skills do work with children over time. I think you'll find this tape a very interesting edition, showing you how to work with children. For me, the DCT framework has shown me for the first time of my life indeed how to communicate much more easily with children. 

00:02:00
DCT Questions With an Elementary Child Shomarhi Austin and Allen Ivey 

00:02:00
ALLEN IVEY  Shomarhi, you were telling me that you, ah, learned how to read about ages four or five. Is that right? 

00:02:25
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yes. 

00:02:25
ALLEN IVEY Could you tell me a little more about that, how it happened? I'd love to hear it. 

00:02:25
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  Well, at first, everyone else was, everyone in the family was older than I was... (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:02:35
SHOMARHI AUSTIN ...and everyone was always reading a lot and I got kind of fed up with it because everyone else could read and I couldn't. 

00:02:40
Concrete 

00:02:40
SHOMARHI AUSTIN And then, finally, I said to someone, "Can I read?" And he said, "Well, first of all, you had to have some point, starting pointers." So my cousin, Belinda cut, took a book that was really old that she started out with, she ripped off the pages and she stapled them together, and every morning my aunt would quiz me onwards and stuff. And from that on, I started, I, uhm, started reading by myself. 

00:03:05
ALLEN IVEY Must have felt awfully good to be able to do that. 

00:03:05
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yeah. 

00:03:05
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. How, how did the teachers feel when you came to school and you're able to read already? 

00:03:10
SHOMARHI AUSTIN They, well, I had to move, I was in the highest reading group when I was in, uhm, first grade. The lowest reading, I mean, math group when I was in first grade, too, but and even though I was in the lowest in math group, I didn't care about math. (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
SHOMARHI AUSTIN I just wanted to get over it. (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
ALLEN IVEY You've felt good about yourself because of reading. (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yeah. 

00:03:30
ALLEN IVEY  Okay, well, let's- 

00:03:35
Imaging sensori-motor experience 

00:03:35
ALLEN IVEY - just stop for a moment and then, can you think of just one scene, Shomarhi, where you at first time you really thought you could really read. Can you see that in your, in your own mind in your first time? 

00:03:45
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yeah. 

00:03:45
ALLEN IVEY What are you seeing? 

00:03:45
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  I was seeing my Aunt Telmecida(ph) sitting across me in her nightgown drinking coffee. 

00:03:50
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:03:50
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  The book in front of me, I'm in my pajamas with my fluffy slippers on and I'm on the first page with a little boy and a dog. 

00:04:05
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, what're you hearing? Your own voice or you're hearing your aunt? 

00:04:10
SHOMARHI AUSTIN No one's reading yet, they're just sitting there. 

00:04:10
ALLEN IVEY Just sitting there. No one's reading yet? I see. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
SHOMARHI AUSTIN No. 

00:04:15
ALLEN IVEY What would I hear if I were to hear something that you were hearing? 

00:04:15
SHOMARHI AUSTIN You'd hear a loud voice- 

00:04:20
Sensori-motor 

00:04:20
SHOMARHI AUSTIN - howling all over the house, paging, pages flipping and stumbling, reading, stumbling and, uhm, feet rattling. 

00:04:30
ALLEN IVEY Feet rattling, huh. And how would you feel when this was going on when you were reading? 

00:04:30
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  I felt pretty good about myself. 

00:04:35
ALLEN IVEY Real good about yourself. How does feeling good about yourself feel? 

00:04:35
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  Happy. 

00:04:40
ALLEN IVEY Happy. You really thought you could do something. I see your eyes kinda smile now, that's wonderful. So you've already told me about that situation and that wonderful feeling when you could read. And there you are in the first grade and you're in the top reading group. What did you do in the first grade, in reading? 

00:05:00
SHOMARHI AUSTIN We had bears- 

00:05:00
Concrete 

00:05:00
SHOMARHI AUSTIN - scavenger hunts. Uhm, we were given kind of thick books to read, at least, in that level it was kind of thick for first grade. 

00:05:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  And, well, we did a lot of things on the board, learned like, uhm, slang words for certain things and stuff. 

00:05:20
ALLEN IVEY  And how did you feel about yourself when you're doing reading then? 

00:05:25
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Well, it's kinda hard and then sometimes it was pretty easy. 

00:05:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm, when it was hard, how did you feel? 

00:05:30
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  I felt really- 

00:05:35
Early formal - pattern 

00:05:35
SHOMARHI AUSTIN - upset with myself. All I did was cry at that time. (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
SHOMARHI AUSTIN I was just sitting there like, "Oh, God, I'll skip it. Just leave that alone I'll come back to it later." 

00:05:40
ALLEN IVEY  Leave it alone and come back to it later. And then when you got it easily, how did you feel? 

00:05:50
SHOMARHI AUSTIN It felt like, "Finally I got it right, after all this time stumbling through it, I finally got it right." 

00:05:55
ALLEN IVEY So, you really felt good about yourself when you got it right. So, one thing I've heard is that you really were an early reader, your family was a big help to you in learning to read. And then you got to school, sometimes it was hard and you felt little sad about it, little depressed as you said. Other times, you got it and you felt better about yourself. Ah, one thing I heard you say was sometimes you just put it away and come back to it later, is that right? 

00:06:20
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yes. 

00:06:20
ALLEN IVEY  Okay. 

00:06:25
Search for formal patterns 

00:06:25
ALLEN IVEY So, now are there any other situations where you kinda get stuck with something that maybe don't go quite go right for you at first and you put it away and go back and try it again. 

00:06:35
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Well, sometimes I get it right and then sometimes I have to leave a lot. 

00:06:40
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, so sometimes you get it right and sometimes you, it, do you find that's helpful for you to go back and try it again in another situation when it doesn't go the first time? 

00:06:50
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yes, very helpful. 

00:06:50
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, how would you describe- 

00:06:50
Formal 

00:06:50
ALLEN IVEY - a person that tries but it doesn't quite work and then goes back and tries it again and gets it? 

00:06:55
SHOMARHI AUSTIN I'd say they had a lot of patience. 

00:07:00
ALLEN IVEY A lot of patience. Do you see yourself as having a lot of patience? 

00:07:00
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Kind of, not all the time. 

00:07:05
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, yeah. Sounds like you had some patience with yourself. Is the patience helpful when you're dealing with problems? 

00:07:10
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Sometimes. 

00:07:10
ALLEN IVEY Sometimes. If you can be patient, you can deal with problems. What types of problems would, would your patience be helpful with you in? 

00:07:20
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Math problems. 

00:07:20
ALLEN IVEY If you had a little more patience in math it might be helpful. 

00:07:20
SHOMARHI AUSTIN  Uhm. 

00:07:25
ALLEN IVEY Putting it away and going back at it again. (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Problem on recess? 

00:07:25
ALLEN IVEY  Problems on recess. So you can be patient in reading and sometimes you get problems on recess. You get the patience there it might be helpful to you. Hmm. Could you tell me a little bit more, let's go back a little bit to something a little more concrete. What is being patient mean to you? 

00:07:45
Multiperpective - almost dialectic 

00:07:45
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Well, it means taking time, forget about, sometimes forgetting about your own problems and help someone else with theirs. 

00:07:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
SHOMARHI AUSTIN And then once you're done, it's done with, you feel kinda good about yourself, you've did a good deed and then you have to go back to your own. 

00:08:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So, one thing I've heard as I've listened to you here is that you have, I guess first of all 'cause your family has been very helpful in some ways in your academic work. You've learned that if you have a problem you can sort of ease back and go back at it again and it goes better, is that right? 

00:08:20
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yup. 

00:08:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
Return to concrete action 

00:08:20
ALLEN IVEY And you're just telling me that you thought this pattern of behavior might be helpful for you if you use it on the playground sometimes when you get a little angry or frustrated, is that so? 

00:08:30
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yes. 

00:08:30
ALLEN IVEY It sounds wonderful. Okay, thank you, Shomarhi. That was great. 

00:08:35
SHOMARHI AUSTIN Yup. 

00:08:35
End DCT Questions With an Elementary child Confrontation and the Confrontation Impact Scale Allen Ivey and Mary Ivey 

00:08:35
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, in this tape, we have two objectives, we'd like to demonstrate the confrontation impact scale and we'd like to show you how to assess yourself the impact of confrontations on a client in at least a role played interview. What's helpful about this particular series is that if you listen carefully to your client, you can tell how much they are incorporating your interventions, whether they're denying them, whether they're just accepting them or whether they're really moving and working with them. What I'd like to do first is present the five stages of the confrontation impact scale. Now, on the scale what we'd like you do is to observe the client that respond at different levels. At the lowest level, we'll throw out a confrontation to the client, on one hand this, in the other hand that. And the client will deny there's any discrepancy or deny that the fact that anything happened at all. Denial is level one of the confrontation impact scale. So, what we'll be doing now is focusing the tape on Mary. I will stop for a minute and you'll hear me do a confrontation and you'll see Mary's response to these confrontations. First of all, we'll see level one. 

00:10:10
ALLEN IVEY On one hand Mary I've heard you talked a lot about your feelings of pain and sadness about the divorce, but as I listened to you, I see some signs of anger. 

00:10:20
Denial 

00:10:20
MARY IVEY I'm not angry about the divorce, it happens. I don't feel anything in particular. 

00:10:25
ALLEN IVEY  On one hand Mary, I hear a lot of pain about the divorce, the other hand I see a fair amount of anger. 

00:10:30
Partial Examination 

00:10:30
MARY IVEY  Yeah, I care, I really care and I sometimes wonder how I can make it on my own. 

00:10:40
ALLEN IVEY On one hand, I see a lot of pain that you're feeling Mary, in the other hand, I think I see some anger in there as well. 

00:10:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
Full examination - no change 

00:10:45
MARY IVEY I guess I do have mixed feelings. You know, when you're married about ten years and some of those years were pretty good and I certainly did care about this marriage. We spent years together, but at the same time, I'm really angry about what happened. 

00:11:05
ALLEN IVEY  One hand Mary, on one hand Mary, you seem to be feeling a lot of pain. 

00:11:10
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:10
ALLEN IVEY  On the other hand, ah, you seemed to be in little touch of your anger as well. 

00:11:20
Creating new dimensions 

00:11:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. As I hear you, I start to realize that it makes sense to have mixed feelings. We had many good things together and part of it I wonder if it isn't a real, realization that part of my feelings or anger aren't around the loss of the dream that went sour and really represent my fear of loss. I realized that loss has always been an issue for me. 

00:11:50
ALLEN IVEY On one hand Mary, we've certainly heard a lot about your feelings of pain. Now, I've seen you able to express your feelings of anger, you got in touch with your loss. Where are you now? 

00:12:00
New and larger constructs 

00:12:00
MARY IVEY  Well, I certainly have a lot of feelings, feelings of pain, of loss and anger. At the same time, I'm beginning to see some possibilities though. I'm seeing the strengths I have and I'd like to start building on those strengths. 

00:12:20
ALLEN IVEY I'd like to do just a little wind-up on those five levels. What you see is what's gonna happen in a client in a space of half an interview or it might take a whole interviewing series. It might take four or five, ten interview sometimes to see those changes in developmental progressions. What is important here- 

00:12:40
How do clients respond to a confrontation? 

00:12:40
ALLEN IVEY  -is to note when you give an intervention or a confrontation to a client, how are they responding, are they denying your intervention, are they working in part of your intervention, are they actually acknowledging it or are they moving to levels four and five and working and moving? You'd like to see clients working and moving. I find that for beginning, and actually for myself as well, people with more experience, is noticing, being able to notice particularly that level to response, where they kinda work in part of what we confront them with, part of intervention, but they leave out part, 'cause here the clients, I think they're especially seductive to us, they, get off our hook and next thing we don't even know that's it happened. So, I think it's very important, as the process note during the interview, to note at what level is the client responding to your interventions periodically. You'll also find this as a very useful outcome measure from beginning to the end of therapy. 

00:13:35
Kubler-Ross Stages of Death and Dying Death and Isolation 

00:13:35
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, you're wrong I can't have cancer. Ah, the test must be all screwed up. Ah, I get my exercise, I, I think I eat right, yeah. I mean, I know my mother died of cancer, but, nuh, those test are wrong. It must be something else. Go back and run them again. Why me? 

00:14:05
Anger 

00:14:05
ALLEN IVEY What have I done to deserve this? You know, it, yeah, it, it, godda, it isn't fair! It, it, that doesn't make sense. Dammit! Well,- 

00:14:20
Bargaining 

00:14:20
ALLEN IVEY - maybe if I go on a macrobiotic diet and, uh, try running some more, I think that might take care of it. Ah, maybe there is, ah, a problem but I think there's, I think there are some things that can be done, ah, I think, you know the meditation, you know, and Seagal says that we choose our illnesses, not me. I think that, ah, I can do something about it. But that means,- 

00:14:55
Depression 

00:14:55
ALLEN IVEY  -ah, I'd have to leave the family, just, just seems like too much. Ah, it feels heavy, ah. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:35
ALLEN IVEY  Well, maybe that is it, I know I sure do feel tired. Ah, it's real sad talking with my kids but there's not an awful lot that I can do, so I think I'm going to have to make the best of what, what's left. I think I can still can do some things in the time that's left. Ah, I suppose when one faces what I've got- 

00:16:30
Acceptance 

00:16:30
ALLEN IVEY - to face, it's, ah, not really all that great. But this friend gave me, Victor Frankl's, ah, Man's Search for Meaning, and, ah, in doing a review of my life and God knows, I made a lot of mistakes, but I think there's some things I'm going to leave behind that I can feel good about ah, and a lot of things to be thankful for. I think we can still do something. 

00:17:15
End Confrontation and Confrontation Impact Scale Life-span Development: Introspective Developmental Counseling Hodges Glenn and Allen Ivey 

00:17:15
ALLEN IVEY  In this next tape, we're going to demonstrate introspective developmental counseling. IDC was developed by Koji Tamase, a visiting scholar from Japan, who worked with me on the issues of how can we integrate Ericksonian Developmental theory with concepts of developmental counseling in psychotherapy. Well, what we'd like to do with Hodges Glenn is demonstrate one of the four stages of IDC. IDC consists of evaluation of four stages of life: One, birth through school, elementary school period, adolescence and, finally, what's going on in the person's life right now. What you find, as you conduct the systematic life review, the clients are often continuing old patterns from the past, and you can use this as diagnostic family history, individual history framework, so you can understand where your client is coming from. I'll be going at this with some real issues from my own early childhood and we'll let you take a look and see what you discover. 

00:18:40
HODGES GLENN  Hello, Allen. 

00:18:45
ALLEN IVEY Hi, Hodges. 

00:18:45
HODGES GLENN How are you doing? 

00:18:45
ALLEN IVEY Well, we're getting ready to try this. 

00:18:50
HODGES GLENN All right. I'd like to ask you some questions about your childhood. 

00:18:50
ALLEN IVEY  Yeah. 

00:18:55
HODGES GLENN A lot of times we can discover how a person functions in things. I'm going to ask you a few questions and I'd like you to answer them... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
HODGES GLENN ...in your own way... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
ALLEN IVEY  Okay. 

00:19:05
HODGES GLENN ...and I plan to follow up on some detail on them. 

00:19:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:19:05
The past affects one's present life 

00:19:05
HODGES GLENN  At the end you're doing it. I'll be asking you about how the past affects your present life. 

00:19:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay, so one thing we're gonna look at is some details about, ah, the early life stages and we'll sort of take a look at the end and see. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
HODGES GLENN Right. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY How it's affecting what's going in my life now. 

00:19:25
HODGES GLENN Right. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY Is that right? 

00:19:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:19:25
HODGES GLENN  Okay. Can you tell me about your family. 

00:19:30
Obtain general context of developmental period 

00:19:30
ALLEN IVEY Well, Hodges, I grew up in rural Washington state and I was born in 1933 or at the depths of the depression. 

00:19:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
ALLEN IVEY  And, ah, and dad ran a grocery store... (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
ALLEN IVEY ...and, ah, as my, and, ah, my mother, ah, both of them were sort of children of you might say, ah, of, of poverty and, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
ALLEN IVEY  like the day after the week that they were getting married, my dad was thrown out of the job, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
ALLEN IVEY ...that type of things... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
ALLEN IVEY ...and it kind of a hard time in the early stages. 

00:20:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm, uh hmm. What particular point in life events were they experience in doing your earliest years? 

00:20:15
ALLEN IVEY I think the, in a way I already said that, I think the depression... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
ALLEN IVEY  and, ah, I think at anytime you work with anybody my age. 

00:20:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
ALLEN IVEY You know, I see myself as the "Depression kid," you know, there's always that, ah, thing is, things are okay now but will they be in the future. I was raised... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
ALLEN IVEY ...with a lot of that... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
ALLEN IVEY ...plan for tomorrow type of stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, surely the Depression has some real significant effect. 

00:20:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
ALLEN IVEY Ah, the other piece, I suppose, is growing up in the very rural area. 

00:20:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
ALLEN IVEY Right, very small rural area. 

00:20:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Is there anything about your birth that you heard from your parents when you were growing up... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:20:55
HODGES GLENN ...that you could talk about. 

00:21:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, it's, ah, apparently I was a very noisy kid. 

00:21:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, I was so noisy in the nursery they said I woke everybody up, so what they did they stuck me in the laundry. 

00:21:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
ALLEN IVEY  And, there were always kind of jokes about how I've always been noisy that I had to be put, I wasn't allowed to stay in nursery and Mrs. Reilly who run the Reilly Hospital just stuck me off in the... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:21:25
ALLEN IVEY ...in the nursery. 

00:21:25
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:21:25
ALLEN IVEY And not in the nursery, in the, literally in the laundry room. 

00:21:25
HODGES GLENN Hmm. So they said you were a noisy child. 

00:21:30
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, ah, it just, and you know it's one of those things you sort of sit there and it was kinda funny at the same time but it's kinda leave you saying, you know. 

00:21:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
ALLEN IVEY Apparently, I didn't quite fit in at that time. 

00:21:45
HODGES GLENN What kind of feelings does that bring up? 

00:21:45
ALLEN IVEY Well, even as I mentioned that I kinda still get a little feeling of maybe you even saw me twitching a little bit like that. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
HODGES GLENN Yes, I did. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
ALLEN IVEY I don't feel, ah, real comfortable about, one time you think it's funny but then you sit there and you, thinking well, what is this business about... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
ALLEN IVEY ...apparently, I always was a pretty active kid so at least it makes me feeling a little, a little off-center. 

00:22:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
ALLEN IVEY  Can we push that further and we'll stop there. 

00:22:15
HODGES GLENN All right, I, I kinda understand that. Can you tell me more about your life from the earliest part that you can remember? 

00:22:25
ALLEN IVEY Well, really, ah, we lived at the back of the store and in those days, you know, just way back when I was a kid... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, I remember particularly, ah, a general sense of closeness with my parents and things being, as a kid really pretty smooth. 

00:22:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
ALLEN IVEY But you wake up and, of course, there's no central heat in those days and I run downstairs and get dressed behind the stove and that was a real high point of the day. 

00:22:55
HODGES GLENN Wow. (laughs) I bet it was. 

00:22:55
ALLEN IVEY It was pretty cold where I was and ah, and I'd like to crawl in bed between my folks just to get warm. 

00:23:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
ALLEN IVEY I remember how good that felt. 

00:23:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. What's the most impressive thing that happened prior to kindergarten? 

00:23:10
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, the most impressive thing at the moment I don't recall anything particular. (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
ALLEN IVEY Impressive I kinda recall ah, again a general feeling of smoothness and things feeling uhm, feeling very good in relationships. 

00:23:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
ALLEN IVEY A quarter mile on one way there's one set of relatives and then another quarter mile down the road there's another set of relatives. 

00:23:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
ALLEN IVEY The whole family was there. 

00:23:40
HODGES GLENN You're fairly close together as family. 

00:23:40
ALLEN IVEY  Also I guess as you've mentioned that... (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
ALLEN IVEY ...together, being born in 1933, it's the bottom of the birth, uh, the amount of kids that were born. 

00:23:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
ALLEN IVEY You know, just for a long time, almost a century and, ah, having nobody to play with, so awful lot of alone time. 

00:24:00
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:24:00
ALLEN IVEY  Immense lot of alone time. 

00:24:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. What kind of behavior bothered your mother when you were a preschool child? 

00:24:10
ALLEN IVEY Well, I think I kinda already alluded to that ah, as I look back at it now... (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, I realized that I really was, ah, what we call now, I think I was a hyperactive child. 

00:24:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
ALLEN IVEY I would be pushing and shoving... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
ALLEN IVEY ...and ah, running... (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY ...and ah, I would often run in things and break things. 

00:24:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, and, ah, it was, you know, it was joked about... (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:24:40
ALLEN IVEY ...and you kinda... (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:24:40
ALLEN IVEY ...felt down, what's wrong with me? 

00:24:45
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:24:45
ALLEN IVEY I didn't have the ADD, the attention issues, 'coz I could... (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
ALLEN IVEY  for some reasons I could always focus. 

00:24:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
ALLEN IVEY Maybe that was because I always had to play alone or something. 

00:24:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
ALLEN IVEY  Definitely, I'm very hyperactive, very busy. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
ALLEN IVEY Always doing something. I wake up, start running and I basically run until I fell asleep. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
Note how Hodges integrates the DCT questioning sequence in the following section 

00:25:00
HODGES GLENN  If I can paraphrase, you appear to be very in touch with that. There's a lot of body, uhm, movement, and you, there's a lot of expression on your voice. Can you give me a concrete example during that time? 

00:25:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
HODGES GLENN In your childhood? 

00:25:20
ALLEN IVEY  Well. 

00:25:25
HODGES GLENN Where those issues were very, very prevalent. 

00:25:25
ALLEN IVEY Ah, there was a time, probably about the ages of between four and five. 

00:25:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
ALLEN IVEY Ah, and I notice happen to some hyperactive kids. 

00:25:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
ALLEN IVEY Ah, this, ah, I actually- 

00:25:35
Sensori-motor 

00:25:35
ALLEN IVEY - recall having, I feel like I had a motor inside me. 

00:25:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
ALLEN IVEY That was driving me, rather than I was driving the motor. 

00:25:45
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:25:45
ALLEN IVEY And I know there are some hyperactive kids that talk about this motor. 

00:25:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
ALLEN IVEY And it speaks, I think, it speaks, uh, to me in some ways as I have a particular (inaudible ) image. The image that I often think about... (crosstalk) 

00:25:57
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:25:57
ALLEN IVEY ...one time, is, ah, is a time of like a real heavy activity in movement in my part. 

00:26:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, I remember standing at the door, at the image of, literally at the, at the door... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
ALLEN IVEY ...of, of a house. And it's almost like, "Do I go in, or do I go out?" And I vaguely recall going in- 

00:26:20
Concrete 

00:26:20
ALLEN IVEY - and out of the door. 

00:26:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
ALLEN IVEY And if I were to go out, you know, there'd be, it's almost like the motor was running me. 

00:26:25
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:26:25
ALLEN IVEY And finally, I remember saying, somehow saying to myself, I'm not gonna let this motor run me. 

00:26:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
ALLEN IVEY  I'm going to control it. 

00:26:35
HODGES GLENN Control it. 

00:26:35
ALLEN IVEY And I... (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
HODGES GLENN  Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
ALLEN IVEY ...basically, I stayed inside, and, learn gradually to control that, that, that motor. Ah, more or less. 

00:26:45
HODGES GLENN More or less. (laugh). Okay, that brings up an important point. Uhm, today, as you go to your day-to-day activities, do you see any similarity between that and how you function today? 

00:27:05
ALLEN IVEY It's, it's kinda surprising- 

00:27:05
Formal 

00:27:05
ALLEN IVEY - is that sometimes, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
ALLEN IVEY  I think of myself as just too grown up hyperactive child. (inaudible ) Granny goose, it's kinda like, I still kinda like to steal the apples... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
HODGES GLENN  Uh-huh. 

00:27:20
ALLEN IVEY ...and, ah, ah, challenge things. 

00:27:20
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:27:20
ALLEN IVEY Do things a little bit differently than others. 

00:27:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, ah, ah, you've seen some of my, some other time worka, workaholic behavior, not a full workaholic... (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
ALLEN IVEY ...but, ah, if I play, I'm a playuholic. 

00:27:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
ALLEN IVEY Everything is done in a more or less of the type a... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
ALLEN IVEY ...fashion, ah, you know, lots of energy and, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
ALLEN IVEY ...sometimes, particularly when I get moving, quick movements, you have seen this in me, I think sometimes. 

00:27:45
HODGES GLENN Right, I have. 

00:27:45
ALLEN IVEY Ah, I think that's a continuation from that. 

00:27:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
ALLEN IVEY And yet, to a lot of people, I come across pretty cool and controlled. 

00:27:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
ALLEN IVEY And you've seen that, too. 

00:27:55
HODGES GLENN Yeah. 

00:27:55
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, I think that's a continuation. And I- 

00:28:00
Dielectic/systemic (Analysis of system) 

00:28:00
ALLEN IVEY - I think a lot of that goes right back, and it can goes back for a lot us, to our... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
ALLEN IVEY ...to our childhood experiences. 

00:28:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
ALLEN IVEY It's kinda intriguing to, ah, sit there and think of a five-year-old kid, ah, sitting there making a decision like that. It's kinda, in some ways I feel good about myself when I think about them. 

00:28:20
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:28:20
ALLEN IVEY Except I'm still, at the same, having some troubles with impulse control, 

00:28:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:28:25
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, as my wife Mary says, "Where did that off the wall comment come from? 

00:28:30
ALLEN IVEY So, that, ah, you don't always leave our past behind, I don't think. 

00:28:35
HODGES GLENN Okay. How did you feel about your parents when you were a pre-school child? 

00:28:40
ALLEN IVEY Ah, I think I've, again I've already said that, I think, real feelings of warmth and closeness. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
ALLEN IVEY Ah, I think I've said that tinge of, ah, feeling of put down, I think I, anytime they got a kid as funny around like I was (laugh) my parents are gonna be a little distracted. Ah, at the same time. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, a general feeling of patience and love. 

00:29:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah, so that I think that enough stability... (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:29:05
ALLEN IVEY ...was provided. And, ah, certainly, my parents could see that I was structured... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
ALLEN IVEY ...of course, and, that I think about that now, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
ALLEN IVEY I suspect all that control didn't come from within. 

00:29:20
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:29:20
ALLEN IVEY And, I guess, I guess we know now, the research today to say that... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
ALLEN IVEY ...hyperactive kids do need... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
ALLEN IVEY ...good, solid, instructional parents. They didn't have behavior model in those days. (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
ALLEN IVEY I think I got some of that. 

00:29:30
HODGES GLENN Hmm. Interesting. ah, did you have any brothers and sisters at that age? 

00:29:35
ALLEN IVEY No, ah, not at that age. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
HODGES GLENN No. 

00:29:40
ALLEN IVEY My sister did come along like nine years later. 

00:29:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
ALLEN IVEY Which, for a normal child was quite a trauma, but we... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
HODGES GLENN Well. 

00:29:45
ALLEN IVEY ...could look at that until we get to the next stage. 

00:29:45
HODGES GLENN Right. (laugh) 

00:29:45
CLIENTS SHOULD FEEL FREE NOT TO RESPOND. 

00:29:45
ALLEN IVEY We'll leave that out. 

00:29:45
HODGES GLENN  Okay. (laugh) 

00:29:50
ALLEN IVEY Leave sibling rivalry out. 

00:29:50
HODGES GLENN All right. 

00:29:50
ALLEN IVEY For now. 

00:29:50
HODGES GLENN Okay. Is there any particular event that you feel either very happy or afraid about, at that age? 

00:30:00
ALLEN IVEY I think that issue at the doorstep is a real... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
ALLEN IVEY ...critical one. Ah, the, the happy event during kind of the, well, I guess, it's it's not, I think it really is getting in the covers between the, between mom and dad. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
ALLEN IVEY  Just, ah, all feeling safe and comfortable. 

00:30:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
ALLEN IVEY And I guess that would be an important part of my development. 

00:30:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. You seem really in touch with that. 

00:30:35
ALLEN IVEY Right. 

00:30:35
HODGES GLENN  What single event did you recall most positively from this period in your life? 

00:30:45
ALLEN IVEY I think, I guess, it's just a repeat of the last one, I guess. 

00:30:45
HODGES GLENN  Okay. From this, what overall patterns would you say were prevalent and how did they affected your life? 

00:31:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh, that's a dangerous thing to ask a professor about pattern. Do you know that? (laugh), Ah, I think I really kinda al, always sad that... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
ALLEN IVEY ...I think there's the workaholic behavior... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
ALLEN IVEY ...the fact that I, I play, and I, I love the skis, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY ...when I go skiing, I am there at, ah, eight o' clock, so I can be on the slope first before the slopes are, are, are skid off. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:31:20
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, as long as I can stand it, I will go up and back, and up and back, ah, why bother to stay in there. (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
ALLEN IVEY  There's, there's that type of activity level. 

00:31:30
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:31:30
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, as Mary would say, ah, "Won't you ever slow down?" ah, I'm very lucky I have such a patient woman to deal with this, ah, tricky-itchy ivy. 

00:31:45
HODGES GLENN (laugh) Interesting. All right. Thank you very much. 

00:31:45
ALLEN IVEY Thank you, Hodges. I think that I got a little clearer picture of some of these things talking to you. 

00:31:50
HODGES GLENN I'm glad. 

00:31:50
ALLEN IVEY Ah, we might do just a quick debriefing... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, how did you feel going through the interview with me? 

00:32:00
HODGES GLENN I felt, ah, extremely interested. (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
HODGES GLENN Ah, I got to understand more about you as a person, how your childhood, and the things you did as a child... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
HODGES GLENN ...perceived, and, even your way about making decisions were all being formulated back then at such an early age. 

00:32:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:25
HODGES GLENN And, ah, as an adult, it, it just seem as if there was a fine-tuning process that is taking (laugh) place, playing the effects of the environment... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:35
HODGES GLENN ...other issues, but, ah, clearly, ah, a lot of it took place back when you were growing up. 

00:32:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. A lot of the patterns, as more I look at it, and take of this, the social learning or psych-analytic pattern... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
HODGES GLENN  Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
ALLEN IVEY ...program theory. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
ALLEN IVEY I think a lot of what we are goes back to what we, what we were in the beginning. Whether it's biology, or... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
ALLEN IVEY ...environment, the way those interact. Ah, I'm really quite struck, ah, as I was going through with, through this, this really, the issues of wanting to burst free... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
HODGES GLENN Right. (laugh) 

00:33:05
ALLEN IVEY  And the other part saying, hey, I can't burst that for you. I'm going to have to keep it under control, this, this kind of, ah, constant battle for me. 

00:33:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, I, even now, I guess, sometimes occasionally, I feel the motor going. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
ALLEN IVEY  And at that point, as I think, got from relaxation training... (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
ALLEN IVEY ...and so forth. In terms of the overall view of Introspective Developmental Counseling, ah, this approach, I'm recommending that, and to anybody- 

00:33:35
The value of examining oneself 

00:33:35
ALLEN IVEY - that goes into counseling, or psychotherapy training... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
ALLEN IVEY ...needs to look at themselves in their own developmental history. 

00:33:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
ALLEN IVEY And I'm asking my students to, in pairs, go through this one with another. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
ALLEN IVEY And we can through this, of course, in great depth, we could develop the images... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
ALLEN IVEY ...and strengths. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
ALLEN IVEY Inch to this thing, and a lot more follow up. I felt that, ah, myself, I feed back for you, I liked your pacing... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
ALLEN IVEY I felt you're with me. 

00:34:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, and, even though I'm big in microskills and paraphrasing... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
ALLEN IVEY ...I thought that paraphrasing back and summarizing some of the key things... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
ALLEN IVEY ...help sink it in, sink my story a little bit better. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
HODGES GLENN Mmm. 

00:34:10
ALLEN IVEY Anything you might wanna add as we finish? 

00:34:15
HODGES GLENN (sigh) Uhm, no. I appreciate the feedback. Thank you. 

00:34:20
ALLEN IVEY Thank you. 

00:34:20
HODGES GLENN Nice working with you. (sigh) 

00:34:20
End Life-span Development: Introspective Developmental Counseling DCT Assessment and Treatment Planning with Personality Disorders Mary Bradford Ivey Allen Ivey Hodges Glenn Elsa Orjuela 

00:34:20
ALLEN IVEY  (sigh) What we'd like to do in this tape, which by the way, will be more complex than the rest of them, is show how to use DCT in treatment planning, and particularly, we're gonna focus on treatment planning and understanding several of the personality disorders, although I prefer to call them developmental personality styles. The critical thing I recall from John Bowlby was, he said, I asked him, after he's gone through his theory, how did he treat clients? What was his motive? How did he work to help them? And he looked at me and he said, "Well, I do pretty much with any other analytic-oriented therapist would do. But what I find really important is, how the client treats me, is how the client likely was treated in the past." And he also said, "this is our clue for treatment." 

00:35:35
How the clients treats the counselor in the interview is an indication of how the client was treated in the past. This is our clue for treatment. 

00:35:35
ALLEN IVEY These words of John Bowlby's really rung in my ears, and stayed with me as a very helpful way to think about counseling and therapy. For indeed, how that client reacts with you, in the here and now of the interview, is a repetition, a reflection in some way, of the past developmental history. We talked about developmental object relation's theory, but these developments from the past played themselves out in the interview. And that's where I'd like to work with you a little bit today. And, we're gonna focus today on what I find, probably, easiest personality disorder, or developmental personality style, to understand. And that's the one of the, ah, dependent personality. And, what we're going to do in this tape is, first of all, have you look at a dependent personality style. And I'd like you to think about as you look at this next tape, how do you personally feel as you watch this client you're about to see. What I mean by that is, notice your internal reactions, also if you can, and lot of you, lot of you will be able to do this, what happens in your own body, what happens in your own kinesthetic feelings as you watch this client talk to you on the tape. Allow yourself to experience it- 

00:36:55
Note your own feelings as you watch the tape. 

00:36:55
ALLEN IVEY - and notice your reactions. That's the first step to noticing how the client is treating you. 

00:37:00
Applying the DCT Model with Dependent Personality Style 

00:37:00
ALLEN IVEY  So, how things been going this week, Mary? 

00:37:10
ALLEN IVEY Oh, absolutely terrible. I called you three times this week, it's been a terrible week. The dishwasher broke, the, the sewer backed up, I mean, I, I call my ex-husband to tell him fix it. I didn't know what to do. Didn't you know, didn't you get my phone calls? I needed you, I needed to talk to somebody. Kids were just awful. It was a terrible week. I mean, where were you when I really needed you? 

00:37:35
ALLEN IVEY We build the first thing to do in working with developmental personality styles is look at your own developmental personality style, in your own history. One of the ways to get at this is to look at your reactions to the client. A tendency, too often, is to think about, what do we do to this client? What do we say, what do we do? You notice the tone of my voice, you've already got yourself triggered and caught by the client. First thing you need to do before you come in, and sometimes during the session, just become aware of what's happening in your own body. For example, and listening to that, I felt my own self with being taken away by this client. We stand by the way, if you want to play an important exercise on this, you could stop the point, the tape at this point, and go back to times in your own life, where you've encountered developmental clients, or dependent clients, or yourself that felt dependent, and give a sense of your own feeling about dependency. So the clue, a lot of the times that you're working with the dependent client, is what's going on in your own body. You'll find that you'll react different to borderlines, to paranoid styles. Different types of styles will tend to produce different types of reaction in you. Another thing you can tell, once you had that feeling within yourself, not only is a client reacting to you this way, but likely, they are going to react in other situations in a similar fashion. Now, I'm gonna turn back to Mary, and ask her about, for example, what's going on in certain other situations, and you'll see that this dependent style tends to repeat itself in certain situations. And finally, particularly listen as I he -, help her focus a bit on her family of origin, where this dependent style might have been learned. I'd like to think about developmental personality styles as being learned, as a way of loosening up some of the tightness of the word, difficult word, I think, disorder. Okay, Mary, let's come back. You say that, I hear you're saying that you really would like some help. And you really feel. 

00:39:35
MARY Yes, I would. 

00:39:35
ALLEN IVEY Ah, well, let us switch for a minute. Could you tell me whether about how things are going for you on the job? 

00:39:40
Dependent style on the job 

00:39:40
MARY  Well, you know, Doctor, my, uhm, principal wanted me to try a new approach to keeping my schedule and documenting the work that I'm doing. He didn't really give me clear directions. And I try to meet with him again to try to find out what exactly he wanted me to do. I just, I just wasn't sure how he wanted it. I know he wants something, and I know I have to do this, and I, I just felt so unsure, and I try to meet with him, he was so busy all the time. He just didn't seem to wanna meet with me. It was, it was very difficult. I mean, I have to do it, I don't know exactly what to do. It's, ah, very troubling. 

00:40:15
ALLEN IVEY And so, you find, Mary, on, ah, the job that you kinda feel toward your principal, like you, you do even here with me, is that right? Okay. 

00:40:25
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
ALLEN IVEY Well, also you're saying in the last interview, you got into a new relationship, and you felt really good about that. How is that, how is that been going this week for you? 

00:40:35
MARY Well, I don't know, I, you know, I try to reach my new friend at, at work. You know, he's ve, he's very busy, it's hard to get a hold of him. I'd like to make contact into, be in contact and to know what he is doing and I, I called him a couple of times, and, and he's busy too. It really, it's so important for me to touch base, to, to keep in contact, when I, I just need that. I need that contact to keep me going, to know that the relationship is gonna be good this time. I mean, the other relationship failed... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
MARY ...this has got to be better. 

00:41:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay, this sounds wonderful, Mary. I'd like to go back, now, and just sort of, could you go back to your family of origin. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
Image and Family of origin 

00:41:15
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
ALLEN IVEY Your own family? 

00:41:15
MARY Yes. 

00:41:15
ALLEN IVEY And tell me a little bit about, perhaps an image of some things you recall about, ah, how was it like in your family? 

00:41:25
MARY Well, you know, my mom is kind of a, a take-charge person. She, she likes to run the show and tell everybody what to do. She tells everybody what to wear, you know, how to act. Well, you know, she just takes charge, and tells us all what to do. (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
MARY And. 

00:41:40
ALLEN IVEY And how do you like that? 

00:41:40
MARY  Well, that's all I ever knew, mother telling me what to do. I, I can't imagine any differently. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
MARY I, I really can't. She's just that way, you know. 

00:41:50
ALLEN IVEY And she didn't tell you what to do, what did you do? 

00:41:55
MARY Well, I felt a little troubled, I felt a little anxious, 'cause I felt like I wasn't gonna do it right. 

00:42:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:00
MARY And she, you know, she had an idea of how she wanted us to do, you know, my sister and I to behave, and what we're supposed to wear, how we're supposed to act, and, you know, the kind of activities she wanted us involved in. And a, amount of time we're supposed to practice the piano, and, you know, all those kind of things. (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
MARY That's, that's what she did. 

00:42:15
ALLEN IVEY I think you're saying that your father was kind of, ah, a little bit dependent too. How, how did he and, your mother and father get along? 

00:42:20
MARY  Well, he, a little dependent, little passive, I mean, he was busy with the work, and, he would have their mom said. I mean, she would lay out his clothes in the morning and then, so that he'd know what to wear to work and, and then he'd ask her what, you know, what the plans were for the weekend, what the, he always check with her about everything, in any decision. Everybody check with mom, in any major decision. She was in charge. (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
ALLEN IVEY What happened when you made your own decisions, Mary? Did you ever try that? 

00:42:50
Dependency in many Setting 

00:42:50
MARY Well, I, I try to. I, I try to, but I see, I feel like I wanna, I wanna check with people just to make sure I'm doing the right thing out. You know, I wanna check with you, I wanna check with my principal and, you know, I wanna check with my new friend, to see how things are going. 

00:43:05
ALLEN IVEY Fine, Mary. That's, that's great. ah, I'll come back on the camera here again. What I've been trying to illustrate here is that the way that Mary reacts to me in the interview, in the here and now in the interview, repeats itself in, first of all, the job, it repeats itself in cri, critical personal relationships, it, of course, repeated itself in the marriage. Which you often find as incredible parent issue where couple gets to, of credible pattern, where couple gets divorced and next thing you know, it's been replicated again in the next relationship. And Mary's kind of illustrating- 

00:43:40
Dependency in relationship 

00:43:40
ALLEN IVEY - how a dependent might go about setting up a new type of relationship. In this case, she selected a person apparently that is able, not to call back. Sometimes you get two dependents together in a, two dependent styles together in a relationship. And, ah, they get along pretty well for awhile, but eventually what will happen was that one dependent will become a little more assertive than the other, and gradually, that, (sucking sound) sucking, that often goes with dependent style appears. So that consistency of style- 

00:44:10
Positives in every style 

00:44:10
ALLEN IVEY - across situation, is often manifested here. The, ah, one of the things that is missing from this, although, of course, is we tend to think of dependent personality style as, as bad, negative and pejorative. And one thing I would like you think about is, with that behind every developmental personality style, whether it's antisocial, or dependent, or whatever, there actually is a functional survival mechanism working in there somewhere, where also is something really positive in the dependent style. For example, if you want a relationship with another person that's complete, you better be able to be dependent at times. Being able to let go and trust the caring relationship with another is really critical. And I think that's one important part of a, where to begin with the therapy with a client such as Mary, is to get in touch with their own developmental history, and find something positive. As I like to say, ah, behind every paranoid, where what could be positive of being paranoid? You think you'd like to buy a used car, if you are a bit paranoid? Some value in there, ah, an antisocial person. All of us need to be a little more impulsive and spontaneous at times. Everyone of this developmental personality disorders have something positive in it. And I think that positive mentioned is one place we can go to begin a treatment plan. I'm gonna stop for a minute, and we'll start looking at possible treatment plans for developmental personality styles from a DCT frame of reference. 

00:45:45
DCT and Treatment Planning 

00:45:45
ALLEN IVEY  As I said, John Bowlby told me that how the client treats you is how they were treated, how he or she was treated. The same time, he also said, this is our clue for treatment. How the client was treated is our clue for treatment. And that means, that, one view of developmental personality style was that basically they have been developed for functional useful reasons. If so, we can go back into the, particularly, of the family of origin and the individuals developmental history and see where it came, and then a whole array of techniques become available. One way to understand developmental history, as you might well expect by now, is to use DCT questioning procedures. I'm going to demonstrate just a few of those briefly with Mary, and then I'll turn back the camera and talk about developing in more comprehensive, eclectic, treatment plan, which might be useful for Mary to work on this issue of dependency. Okay, Mary. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
MARY  Uh-hmm. 

00:46:55
ALLEN IVEY Ah, We've been talking for a while, and I certainly have that experience of how much, how very much needy you feel. (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:47:00
ALLEN IVEY Can you get just as generally in touch with that feeling of how you would like help, and peoples of view with you. 

00:47:10
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
ALLEN IVEY Where do you experience that, ah, Mary? 

00:47:10
Sensori-motor 

00:47:10
MARY  Hmm, I think in my heart. 

00:47:15
ALLEN IVEY You just feel it right in your heart. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay, and ah, you're kinda smiling now as you say that, I noticed. 

00:47:20
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
ALLEN IVEY  Okay. Could you give what your heart in, Mary. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:47:25
Search for sensori-motor image 

00:47:25
ALLEN IVEY  And, ah, give me an image some time where you had that feeling of, that you can't express about being dependent on and needing something for somebody. 

00:47:40
MARY Oh, I guess I think of- 

00:47:45
Client slips to formal patterns. 

00:47:45
MARY - growing up in the family and uhm, you know, meaning my parents to be there for me and, and they were very, very busy. My dad had a business, very successful business. He ran a newspaper and a radio station, and mom was busy with all kinds of organizations. (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
MARY President of this and that and I, I, really wanted someone to talk to, to be there with me. And they were there in some sense, when we did things together, but not really to, to talk and. 

00:48:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay, could you give us a sense of one of those specific times when you felt that? 

00:48:20
MARY  Well, I guess, ah, oh, I must have been seven, or eight years old, I don't remember, elementary school and, and, ah, I've come home from. 

00:48:30
ALLEN IVEY Could you just slow down, and can you get a visual image. 

00:48:35
Images useful 

00:48:35
ALLEN IVEY What you think occurs to that? 

00:48:35
MARY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:48:35
ALLEN IVEY Can you see something now, Mary? 

00:48:40
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
ALLEN IVEY What are you seeing? 

00:48:40
MARY Well, I'm seeing me, and, very young coming home from having played with my friend. 

00:48:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
MARY  And having a wonderful time at my friend's house. 

00:48:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:50
MARY We had a wonderful fantasy play, in her base, playing, in her basement with all the different toys and things that they had. And her mom was always there after school, and, and she talked with us. And coming home, and, I guess, wishing that my house was like that too, that we had a place to play like that in the basement, that was so exciting, that my mom was there waiting and talking to us about what we've been playing with, ah, and coming home and feeling kind of empty. Wasn't. 

00:49:15
ALLEN IVEY What image do you get when you come home, Mary? The visual... (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
MARY The image of a little. 

00:49:20
ALLEN IVEY ...Mary, Mary is coming, unlocking home, walking the door, what are you seeing? 

00:49:25
MARY Of course, hoping that there's gonna be someone there to talk with me, and then realizing that there's no one there... (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ALLEN IVEY What. 

00:49:30
MARY ...I mean, I can't share my excitement. 

00:49:30
ALLEN IVEY What are you seeing, as you walk in the door? 

00:49:30
MARY I'm seeing an empty house. 

00:49:35
ALLEN IVEY What do, what, don't describe the, your, the specific room. 

00:49:35
MARY  I'm seeing the living room and the couch against the window and a radio, we didn't have television then, and the radio, and thinking, well, there's no one there in the kitchen, there's no one there, and I'm just gonna have to sit on the couch and listen to my favorite radio show until someone comes home to talk to. 

00:49:55
ALLEN IVEY  Sounds like you did a lot of thinking... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
MARY Uh-huh. 

00:50:00
ALLEN IVEY ...as a young child. 

00:50:00
ALLEN IVEY You're telling, you're saying yourself, you needed to (inaudible ). What were you feeling when you came home to that room, with the radio there... (crosstalk) 

00:50:06
MARY  Feeling. 

00:50:10
ALLEN IVEY ...you're hearing the radio? 

00:50:10
MARY I'm hearing the radio, I'm, I'm feeling lonely wishing I had someone to talk to, to share what had happened. Wishing that I had a playroom downstairs like my friend. Wishing that my mom had been home, making cookies for us and giving us cookies and milk and, and just there to share with us. 

00:50:25
ALLEN IVEY  Could you tell me more to, as a, as a wish, what's the feeling? 

00:50:30
MARY Feeling of loneliness, feeling of loneliness. 

00:50:35
ALLEN IVEY Could you allow yourself to get to that feeling of loneliness? 

00:50:35
Fuller sensori-motor 

00:50:35
MARY  (sigh) Hmm. 

00:50:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm, (sigh) Could you tell me a little about that feeling? 

00:50:50
MARY Mmm. 

00:50:50
ALLEN IVEY What you, what are you feeling now? 

00:50:55
MARY I'm feeling being left alone and, and letting people there when I need them. 

00:51:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. At this point, Mary, we'll stop the, the demonstration in terms of the sensorimotor. (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:51:10
ALLEN IVEY And I think we've got, kind of a concrete example. (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
MARY Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
ALLEN IVEY To move to the more formal operation of a, was that a pattern for you as you were growing up? Did it happen a lot? 

00:51:20
Formal/pattern 

00:51:20
MARY That I was alone? It, it's strange to say that, you know, I, I have a mother who basically wasn't "working" per se. She was, didn't really have an official job but she was president of every organization and into every club in town, doing some wonderful. 

00:51:35
ALLEN IVEY You sound very proud. 

00:51:40
MARY Civic things and I was proud of her. ah, but she wasn't home all the time for me. (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:51:45
MARY And I, you know, I found myself leaving the home to go to somebody else's house. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:51:50
MARY To be there, because that's where it felt more like home, at my friend's house. So I spent a lot of time at my friend's house. As a matter of fact, I remember her basement and her playroom much more vividly than our own. 

00:52:05
ALLEN IVEY So- 

00:52:05
Positive assets and Strengths 

00:52:05
ALLEN IVEY - what are some strengths that you had for survival as a child when you had these things of being alone? 

00:52:10
MARY Well, I guess, I would, you know, use my own resources and find... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:52:15
MARY ...other people to be with. And they used to say that I was, I was very good at meeting people and I could talk to anybody. 

00:52:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:52:20
MARY And I guess that's what I do. I'd, I... (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:52:25
MARY ...wouldn't be afraid to leave the house and go talk to some other people. 

00:52:25
ALLEN IVEY So, so you have real skills of survival even if though you felt alone and somewhat dependent. (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
MARY Uh-huh. 

00:52:35
ALLEN IVEY You had real skills. 

00:52:35
MARY Uh-huh. 

00:52:35
ALLEN IVEY Ah, of going out and relating with other people, (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
MARY Right. 

00:52:40
ALLEN IVEY is that right? 

00:52:40
MARY That's right. Yeah. 

00:52:40
ALLEN IVEY And at those points, were you getting, getting a feeling of rejection that you're getting now? 

00:52:50
MARY Sometimes, if people weren't ready for me or something wasn't set up. 

00:52:55
ALLEN IVEY Yes, and they were the same feelings now? 

00:52:55
MARY And wishing that I had my own mom there and my dad to talk to. 

00:53:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. Okay, now I'm gonna, Thank you, Mary. And come back to the camera. 

00:53:05
Styles learned in family 

00:53:05
ALLEN IVEY What I've tried to do here fairly briefly, just illustrate how the sensorimotor focusing can really be useful in coming in to some of the experiential, often family roots of developmental personal, personality styles. These are, I, I really believe these styles; our styles are learned in the family. Object relations talk about internal object relations, or even talk about it from behavioral sense of social learning history. But this is where we've learned to behave in certain, certain patterns of behavior. I just illustrated the possibilities of DCT questioning procedures for opening things up. Ah, clearly, for understanding where things come from, I would ar, make a strong argument that a DCT interview and/or a Tomase type introspective developmental review can be very helpful in understanding where a client has come from to arrive where they are. The treatment procedure by the way, as you noticed, I tried to reframe a little bit of Mary's, ah, developmental personality style. 

00:54:05
Styles are survival mechanisms 

00:54:05
ALLEN IVEY  As a survival mechanism, a useful thing. To me, they go back about how it was once useful and how we can again make it useful. Now, in terms of developing a DCT type treatment planning- 

00:54:20
Generating a Treatment Plan: Mini Lecture 

00:54:20
ALLEN IVEY - I'd like to think of developing treatment at four levels. One of these is at the sensorimotor level. And I think a great failure of counseling psychotherapy has been, to be too much in the head- 

00:54:30
Sensori-motor Treatment Options 

00:54:30
ALLEN IVEY - ah, we see the tension in Mary's body. Obviously, she can profit from relaxation training, the expressive therapies, movement therapy, ah, she needs to have sometimes we actually find that jogging or, ah, jazzercise, some type of movement type of thing, to just get the, the body flowing. Also, along the way, you might meet somebody so, sensorimotor issues in therapy can be useful including rolfing, massage, a relaxation training. Also, by the way, as part of the treatment you noticed, the "see, hear, feel" fits that Neuro- Linguistic Programming. We could set up a Gestalt exaltation exercise. We can get Mary feeling deep, more deeply, a whole raft(ph) of sensorimotor modalities can be used. And critical in that dimension is getting the person experiencing life in the here and now of the moment. And I think a great, again, a great failure of counseling psychotherapy has been up here in the head and missing what's going on in the heart. And it's getting people to locate where they're feeling their hurts in their own body and use a therapist in your own body as well, that can be immensely valuable. Because you often find, when you run from a client, as all of us do, you're running from your own family history, your own internal part object relation unit. So, look at your own body reaction, because it might tell you where you're moving. Now, in terms of developing a treatment plan for Mary, I would like to have part of her work at the sensorimotor level. You see the high anxiety level, obviously relaxation training and those meditation, whatever can be useful part of a treatment program. Likewise- 

00:56:05
Concrete Treatment Options 

00:56:05
ALLEN IVEY - Mary could probably benefit from a, assertiveness training, ah, in terms of calling her friend. She needs to learn to wait a little longer. She needs to learn how to develop the social skills she once had once again. To not be too aggressive, not too retiring in terms of dealing with that person, perhaps some work from reality therapy. Certainly, there's some cognitive over generalizations, I think the early phases of Ellis' RET can be used to help understand some of her early generalizations, over generalizations. This type of concrete therapies can be very useful in the couns, in the vocational areas, she might very well profit from, again, skills training and some concrete problem solving in terms of how to deal with her employer. So, you see that we need sensorimotor and we also need concrete skills. What happens, I think, all too often- 

00:56:55
Formal Treatment Options 

00:56:55
ALLEN IVEY - is straight cognitive and you get my vocal tone with that. Let's think about it. Let's make Mary feel better about herself, and here we'll do rodgering(ph) client center. We'll do logotherapy. We'll do endless hours of psychoanalysis but actually I found, you can find the developmental roots much more quickly if you go for the sensorimotor functioning and the inter-generational family history. Constructed genogram can be a better way, I think, to get at family patterns that repeat themselves in the individual. And that's an undergirding(ph) thing you in see most of the tapes here. So, it's important for the person to feel better about themselves and to see patterns. But that's only part of the treatment program, not the whole thing. And finally, the dialectic/systemic level, I do think that seeing how you have developed in a system is important. 

00:57:40
DSM and sexist bias 

00:57:40
ALLEN IVEY  DSM-3R and whatever's coming next, DSM-34, is certainly going to be criticized for a sexist bias. We all know the depending client is defined more often as a woman than as a man. We know the man is defined as the anti-social. We also know that if we give certain types of behaviors to (inaudible ) and say this is a man and this is a woman. One is gonna be labeled as one thing and the other is going to be labeled as something else. There is a whole sexist bias to these categories. And being dependent for a man is bad, as acceptable for a woman. Men could stand from, to be far more dependent and women perhaps, could stand a little more proud of being dependent. All of us need to be avoidant at times, so there, they need to focus constantly at the strengths, a need to these developmental disorders. Ah, fourthly- 

00:58:30
Dialectic/systemic treatment options 

00:58:30
ALLEN IVEY - at this dialectic/systemic level, a feminist therapy could be used because preferral(ph) to women's group could help her make become aware that a part of her issues are indeed come from being raised in a sexist culture. Family therapy could indeed be helpful or couples therapy. We start looking at how she interacts with a person in the system. You can almost guarantee that Mary and her new relationship is gonna repeat this pattern of dependent relationships in one way or another. So, in effect- 

00:59:00
All 4 levels for complete treatment plan 

00:59:00
ALLEN IVEY - DCT argues that the treatment plan should offer that, one, the sensorimotor level, look at the body; two, at the concrete level, we work at concrete actions and skills; three, at the formal level, where we get the person looking at themselves and their patterns; and fourthly, at the dialectic/systemic level, where we're looking at self and system and issues of network, culture and gender, affectional orientation, a set that will play themselves out. So, I hope this brief demonstration is giving orientation, at least the beginning orientation, to as how we might use this conceptual framework for the treatment of this particular area of, not disorders, but developmental personality styles. 

00:59:40
Practice With Developmental Personality Styles/Disorder 

00:59:40
ALLEN IVEY  And as a final portion of this tape, we're going to just demonstrate several different developmental personality styles, on camera, short squibs. And again, the first step is stop each, identify what you think the disorder or the developmental personality style is and look first at your own body and then, if you can, free associate back to your own images, from your own life history in dealing with that particular type of individual. One the greatest challenges for you, from any of you is going to be able to work with the anti-social client. Unless you can give the person respect and love, if you don't mind, love, if you don't mind, you're not going to be able to help that person, which means the first step is to look at yourself. And finally, what is in that, what is inside that person that's talking to you that really affects you in a gut level. So, now let's turn to looking at some specific developmental personality styles. 

01:00:45
What developmental personality style is presented here? Note reactions in your own body 

01:00:45
ALLEN IVEY  So, how are things today, Elsa? 

01:00:55
ELSA Fine. 

01:00:55
ALLEN IVEY Could you tell me how, what's been, what's been happening with you this week? 

01:01:00
ELSA Okay. 

01:01:00
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:01:05
ELSA How about the lights here. 

01:01:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah, yeah, you're, you look like you're feeling a little uncomfortable right now. 

01:01:10
ELSA Uhm, no. What makes you think? What makes you say that? 

01:01:20
ALLEN IVEY Uhm. So, you're kind of wondering why I'm asking those questions. 

01:01:25
ELSA Yeah. Why are you asking those questions? 

01:01:25
ALLEN IVEY Why would you think I would ask those questions? 

01:01:30
ELSA I don't know, you wanna know something. I don't know. I don't know. What is it that you wanna know? 

01:01:35
ALLEN IVEY So, it's been a hard week for you? 

01:01:35
ELSA  No. Why are you saying that? 

01:01:40
ALLEN IVEY  Okay. I think that's a good illustration there of, ah, one of the personality styles. Just allow yourself to experience, I won't say this again (inaudible ) what happens in your own body when you encounter this type of client. Look at that first, then worry about what the client might be classified as or how you like/want to react. Okay? 

01:02:05

01:02:05
HODGES GLENN  Well, I'm here. 

01:02:30
ALLEN IVEY Good to see you and how was your week? 

01:02:30
HODGES GLENN  Uhm, it was okay. The only reason I'm here is because, of course, as I needs to be here. So, the sooner we get this done with, the sooner I can get on with my life. 

01:02:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:02:45
HODGES GLENN Yeah. I was caught (sighs deeply). Big deal! Everybody gets caught with drugs, I mean, that's the thing now, everybody's into it. So, what I did isn't that bad. It's help pay my education. 

01:03:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:03:00
HODGES GLENN Not a dummy, I get good grades. (sighs deeply) So. (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
ALLEN IVEY So, you kind of feel that ah, it's, ah, (inaudible ) basically not your fault. 

01:03:10
HODGES GLENN No! Ah, ah, I know. I mean, there are people who are doing it a lot worse than I am. 

01:03:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:03:15
HODGES GLENN And, ah, I mean, this doesn't really affect me. I can, I don't use the stuff. 

01:03:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:20
HODGES GLENN I just sell it. But that's between you and I, I mean, keep... (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:03:25
HODGES GLENN ...this isn't gonna go outside of this room or anything, is it? 

01:03:30
ALLEN IVEY No, no. Ah, this is second time we got together. Ah, I was wondering, ah, this time I said I kinda want to look back a little bit about some of the things that happened when you're growing up. Could you tell me a little bit about, ah. 

01:03:40
HODGES GLENN  There's not much to tell. I mean, I had parents, everybody's got parents. I had a brother and a sister, both pains(ph). Uhm, you know, didn't really communicate that much, matter of fact, I hardly saw much of any of them. I've spent most of my time outside on the street. That's where I learned a lot of stuff... (crosstalk) 

01:04:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:04:00
HODGES GLENN ...on the streets. I think everybody should spend some time there. That's where life really is. 

01:04:05
ALLEN IVEY I've not been on the streets. How do you react to that? 

01:04:05
HODGES GLENN  It's a fact of life. I think people are ignoring that, a big part of it. That's where most of the serious learning takes place. 

01:04:20
ALLEN IVEY So what happened at the, as they sent you in here to be, see me. Do you understand that little. (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
HODGES GLENN Oh, they see it. They caught me pushing, selling some stuff to some kids in college. They said if I wanna continue my education that I need to come here and talk to someone. I'm a business major so, a buck is a buck. I mean, how you make it. And I intend to make my share, betcha. 

01:04:45

01:04:45
ALLEN IVEY  Oh, thank you. How's, how's the week then? 

01:04:55
ELSA  Fine. 

01:05:00
ALLEN IVEY Fine. Would you like to tell me a little bit more of how things have been going? 

01:05:00
ELSA  Uh-huh. 

01:05:05
ALLEN IVEY You seem kind of angry today, Elsa. 

01:05:05
ELSA Angry? No. I'm not angry. 

01:05:10
ALLEN IVEY What's happening with you? 

01:05:10
ELSA  I just don't like coming here. 

01:05:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:05:15
ELSA  I don't know why I had to come here and talk to you. 

01:05:20
ALLEN IVEY Last week, you sound like you're really glad to be here. 

01:05:25
ELSA No, I wasn't. I just told you that. 

01:05:30
ALLEN IVEY Ah, I see. How are things going with your friend? 

01:05:35
[sil.] 

01:05:35
ELSA  Oh, he's just okay, I guess. He's angry at me today. 

01:05:50
ALLEN IVEY Why was he angry at you? 

01:05:50
ELSA I don't know. 

01:05:55
ALLEN IVEY What happened... (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
ELSA People get angry at me all the time. I don't know. 

01:05:55
ALLEN IVEY ...specifically, what happened this time? 

01:06:00
ELSA Nothing. Nothing. I don't understand why people get so angry. 

01:06:05
ALLEN IVEY All right. As I've said, it will help a lot if you can really tell me what he said, what you said and what specifically happened between you, and how can you. (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
ELSA And why do you wanna know these things? 

01:06:20
ALLEN IVEY If you know, when we started, I told you that we would be having a look at things in a fair amount of specific detail. And this is why I'm doing this. (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
ELSA I don't see what the use of it. If you want to look at it, you can look at it. I don't wanna, I don't wanna look at it. I had nothing to look at. I mean, I just don't think that we are to continue, ah, I, I'd want to end. I wanna go. 

01:06:45
ALLEN IVEY I see a mark on your wrist. What happened? 

01:06:55
ELSA Hmm? 

01:06:55
ALLEN IVEY What happened? 

01:06:55
ELSA  What happened? Nothing. 

01:07:00
ALLEN IVEY You have, ah, you have a little mark on your wrist. Were you cutting again?

ALLEN IVEY  How's it going Hodges? 

01:07:15
HODGES GLENN  It's all right. 

01:07:20
ALLEN IVEY Uhm. How does it feel to be here today? 

01:07:25
HODGES GLENN I'm here. I don't know about any feelings but I'm here. 

01:07:35
ALLEN IVEY You're here, huh. 

01:07:35
HODGES GLENN Yup. 

01:07:35
ALLEN IVEY  Why do you think you're here? 

01:07:45
[sil.] 

01:07:45
HODGES GLENN  People say I need to be here. 

01:07:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. What did people say about your needing, why did they say you need to be here? What did they say? 

01:08:00
HODGES GLENN  Uhm, I spend too much time by myself. I don't talk to people. I don't go places. I don't do things, just kinda sit home, watch TV, go to work, to my schoolwork. And I stick to myself, my computer. I spend a lot of time with my computer. That's about it. 

01:08:30
ALLEN IVEY  Do you feel depressed much? 

01:08:35
HODGES GLENN No. Nope. When I have something to say, I talk to Ralph. Ralph's my computer. 

01:08:40
ALLEN IVEY  Uh-huh. 

01:08:45
HODGES GLENN He understands. Nothing against you, but. (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. What else do you do besides do your computer and ah. (crosstalk) 

01:08:55
HODGES GLENN Uhm, classes. I might go home for the holidays. That's about it. 

01:09:00
ALLEN IVEY  How was it with your family? 

01:09:05
HODGES GLENN Hmm, its okay, I guess.

ALLEN IVEY  How are things this week, Mary? 

01:09:15
MARY Well, things are going pretty well, you know. Now that the kids are gone, I'm really able to concentrate in my work. And, you know, the house is so much cleaner, I mean, I could just keep everything perfect. I make lists everyday. I, I just know exactly what I need to do, you know, I keep everything all organized. It's very important when you're trying to, to carry on these careers, you know. To do everything, you want it, you want it just perfect, that I, and two of the kids gone, it's so much easier. I, I can, you know, I can do things the way I want to do things. And my husband's gonna mess some things up, but I have, I'm getting after him. I'm training him. By the way, could you, could you just straighten that tie just to, ah, that's better. It does bother me when things aren't just perfect. 

01:09:55
End Personality Style/Disorder Multicultural Development Hodges Glenn Allen Ivey 

01:09:55
ALLEN IVEY  I think the most critical dimension for the 1990's in counseling and psychotherapy is going to be increased integration of multicultural issues in counseling psychotherapy. Now, one of the ways to get at this is culture-specific counseling. For example, feminist therapy takes, I think, in turns, counseling psychotherapy on its head by suggesting we really ought to start looking at the special needs of a specific cultural group. Note that I used the word cultural broadly. Ah, it can represent any group that has a special need for a different type of counseling approach. While we're not gonna demonstrate couns, feminist counseling in this tape, what we'd like to demonstrate are a few critical issues in thinking about making counseling a little bit more multiculture and need somehow to match the specific wishes of a particular cultural group. To begin this, I brought, ah, Hodges Glenn with me here. And Hodges and I would like to talk about Bailey Jackson's Black Identity Theory. And you know, Bailey and. (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
HODGES GLENN Yes, I do. 

01:11:20
ALLEN IVEY He's been very influential on both of our thinking. 

01:11:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:11:25
ALLEN IVEY His Black Identity Theory is, one of I think, there's three major ones. One is that of Lacrosse(ph), another one is that of Janet Helms and Tom Parham. We worked, Bailey works on our campus with us and we'd like to speak more from his language frame. Uhm, the first stage is, in Bailey's theory is that of an acceptance. Bailey points out that all black people aren't the same and have different consciousness waves. Different, you could say, in, in different language, different developmental levels in thinking about themselves as black people. What is the black individual who comes from the acceptance stage, ah, how do they think about the world? Do they think about the fact that they're, they're black in predominantly white America? 

01:12:10
HODGES GLENN Well, my understanding of his identity theory, a person in that stage, Acceptance. They tend to view society, the social structure as, ah, fairly accepting, meaning, they don't, they don't pay too much particular attention to it. They don't, ah, let it affect them as much. There is a sense that perhaps racism may not even exist from that kind of. (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
ALLEN IVEY In the extreme level (inaudible ). 

01:12:45
HODGES GLENN Right, in the extreme level. Uhm, a good example of that might be someone who is, uhm, ah, working at, ah, say, ah, Burger King, or something like that and, ah, a person who is working with this white(ph) and happens to be promoted faster and given opportunities which this individual may well be qualified for, but is not given that opportunity clearly based on decision of color. They might in turn, interpret that to mean that perhaps this person may have had something better than them, something unforeseen, something they can identify. But rationalize it that, it's a fact, you know, that if something that. (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
ALLEN IVEY I think this rationalization is particularly important, Hodges. And a person like this, for example, might appear for vocational counseling or they might be troubled why they aren't progressing in their job. It can happen in the Burger King level or. (crosstalk) 

01:13:40
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

01:13:40
ALLEN IVEY It can happen at the top level in the industry. 

01:13:40
HODGES GLENN Right. Correct. 

01:13:40
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, for a non-aware white counselor... (crosstalk) 

01:13:45
HODGES GLENN Huh. 

01:13:45
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, there's an awful, I think, it's a real danger, what would be some of the dangers that a non-aware white counselor working with the, a person like this? 

01:13:55
HODGES GLENN Well, for them not to be aware of that, perhaps in some way, may feed into it. 

01:14:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:14:00
HODGES GLENN  Ah, it may give them, uhm, an unwritten license to, to make assumptions about this person in terms of treatment and directions for treatment. Not taking into account that they are seeing the world from their perspective. Uhm, that's what I think. 

01:14:20
ALLEN IVEY  So in effect, ah, as a real, there could be a real danger in really good counseling with this person, like focus an individual and failed to acknowledge the systemic... (crosstalk) 

01:14:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:14:30
ALLEN IVEY ...racist factors that might actually be existing. 

01:14:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:14:35
ALLEN IVEY So this is one type of, of group that Bailey Jackson identifies. The second type he talks about is a level of resistance and anger. And this seems to occur when a person becomes aware of the contradiction in the reason, becomes aware of the Burger King operation. (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:14:50
ALLEN IVEY How might a person like this present themselves for counseling, if indeed they would? 

01:14:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Well, I think a person like that might present themselves as, ah, having a lot of anger, but anger that they tend to externalize, direct outside. 

01:15:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:15:05
HODGES GLENN They might appear intimidating or show some sign of physical force as a way of demonstrating that. (crosstalk) 

01:15:10
ALLEN IVEY And a white counselor frankly don't really feel comfortable with people like that all the time. 

01:15:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Correct. Correct. Uhm, that type of, ah, you know, demonstration, show a force intimidation tends to, as a norm, set people off... (crosstalk) 

01:15:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:15:25
HODGES GLENN ...or make them retreat and feel very uncomfortable and, uhm, once again, can make counseling with that individual extremely difficult and many times, ah, the sessions end up terminating, you know, quite quickly. (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
ALLEN IVEY My feeling in this type of situation that, ah, for the most part, a non-black counselor situation like that probably is best off to refer... (crosstalk) 

01:15:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:15:50
ALLEN IVEY ...to a, a, a black community where, or to a black counselor. 

01:15:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:15:50
ALLEN IVEY Or to provide barely concrete specific information... (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:15:55
ALLEN IVEY ...and not get into the more involved emotional issues, that sound reasonable or? 

01:16:00
HODGES GLENN Yeah. I think that's a, a definite option in terms of, of how to approach that, I would. (crosstalk) 

01:16:05
ALLEN IVEY As the undergirding theory for me is blacks are not the same. 

01:16:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:10
ALLEN IVEY The same type of theories could be applied to Asians or Native Americans. When we say counseling black clients, we should always remember there are different ways that black clients are gonna present themselves for counseling. A third stage that, ah, Bailey talks about is Redefinition. This is sometimes called the stage of black pride. What happens to a black individual who moves to this level? You mentioned externalization. Could you move more to internalization at this stage? 

01:16:35
HODGES GLENN Uhm, well, internalization, in a sense I think, what has happened is they, ah, have some sense of being able to identify with their own culture. There's a real pull for finding things within this society or even going back, as they say, to Africa or somewhere where they can get a sense of identity and lineage and, uhm, incorporate that as, ah, as a way of valuing themselves. I think about, uhm, the art and the music, ah, the scholars; it's a sense of wanting to say, "I am black. This is who I am." And in some ways perhaps, uhm, ignore, ah, the greater culture, American culture, the white culture. Uhm, but it's their way of trying to really find what's theirs and hold on to it. 

01:17:30
ALLEN IVEY So in effect, blacks at, ah, stages two and three in a theory are less likely to appear for counseling. 

01:17:35
HODGES GLENN Perhaps, yeah. But it's definitely possible. 

01:17:40
ALLEN IVEY 'Coz they're seeking their support within their own community? 

01:17:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:17:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. Ah, again, I sometimes find that, blacks or other minorities that are at this level of finding their own self identity... (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

01:17:50
ALLEN IVEY ...sometimes might come to an, an, a counselor not from their own racial or ethnic group. 

01:17:55
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

01:17:55
ALLEN IVEY To get specific information and so forth. But this is about all that really can be done. 

01:18:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:18:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, and there'll be a lot of testing in both groups, if they happen to... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
HODGES GLENN For sure, yeah. 

01:18:05
ALLEN IVEY ...white person. The fourth stage of Bailey's theory is Internalization. Ah, could you tell us a little bit about that and what it means? And, ah, from, from your own personal experiences perhaps. 

01:18:15
HODGES GLENN Well, internalization appears to be one of the, ah, looking at it developmentally, ah, one of the more favorable positions because it allows you to, ah, fit yourself into a given specific situation. 

01:18:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:35
HODGES GLENN And use that as a model for how you think about the situation, how you behave. Uhm, for instance, there are situations where I maybe more prudent to, ah, to address issues of racism, to actually, ah, perhaps, show, ah, force. 

01:18:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:55
HODGES GLENN While in other situations it may be more warranted to, ah, take a less, uhm, say, covert or obvious or open, ah, action. I think it's important, like in my own personal experience, to be able to look at the situation realistically and to find options that allow you to express your identity as a person. 

01:19:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:25
HODGES GLENN While at the same time, realizing that there is perhaps an oppressive element out there and it may be racial or it may be some other factors as well. But it's up to you to be able to be, ah, open and, uhm, analytical in understanding it. And then making your choices and acting on them. 

01:19:50
ALLEN IVEY So there are, I, I think you made that pretty clearly that different levels are gonna respond to counseling in very different ways. Ah, to wind up the section, in terms of issue of just, ah, non-white, non-black, ah, that could be, it could be people from other... (crosstalk) 

01:20:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:20:10
ALLEN IVEY ...other people of color, other minority groups, any particular things you might think are important from your own experience the people might think of when they're likely counseling people or black. 

01:20:15
HODGES GLENN  Well, I would say, ah, to be sensitive. 

01:20:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:20
HODGES GLENN  Ah, sensitivity meaning, ah, both non-verbal and verbal communication. People, ah, express themselves constantly and be aware that, ah to also be aware of their, the assumptions they make... (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:35
HODGES GLENN ...ah, when they see a client initially and as they go through the treatment with them, and, ah, identify what it is, ah, culturally in terms of a frame or reference that that person's coming from. 

01:20:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:20:50
HODGES GLENN Being aware of their own and, ah, being honest with themselves and their client in terms of, of, ah, trying to help them do what it if, whatever it is they want to do... (crosstalk) 

01:21:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
HODGES GLENN ...treatment. Ah, and I guess also just to be aware and honest that if it's not working to not feel failure, ah, you know, as a professional whether it's non-white or whatever... (crosstalk) 

01:21:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:15
HODGES GLENN ...in your treatment because... (crosstalk) 

01:21:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:20
HODGES GLENN ...ah, culturally people, you know, as these, ah, different developmental levels show, ah, common various stages, and some people are stuck or more open to change... (crosstalk) 

01:21:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:21:30
HODGES GLENN ...than others, and, ah, it's not to say that, ah, culturally aware white counselor can't help, ah, they, ah, culturally, ah, a particular black person in a certain culture or framework that they has some issues around anger and resistance. Uhm, but it's not to see that person isn't a good counselor. 

01:21:50
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:21:50
HODGES GLENN So they need to be able to try not to internalize that personally. 

01:21:55
ALLEN IVEY  So we'd like to say I guess in closing that, ah, a lot more that can be done, but I think this introduces some key aspects of thinking about development in a multi-cultural context. And all of these theories, have, I think, to be adapted to meet the needs of where that client's coming from. For example, I have a hard time imagining, ah, we give a lot of attention in the DCT to what you see here, feel, and so forth. (crosstalk) 

01:22:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:22:20
ALLEN IVEY I have a hard time imagining, ah, a black client. For me the resistance or internally, ah, internalization level, or, I mean... (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:22:30
ALLEN IVEY ...redefinition level, accepting that type of "rock 'em, suck 'em... (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:22:30
ALLEN IVEY  get to the gut," until a real solid firm basis of trust has been developed first. Would you agree? 

01:22:35
HODGES GLENN I would think so too, that, ah, someone at that stage, you know, particularly has, ah, developed a pretty, ah, complex, and I think strong intellectual system for understanding things, and, ah, before they're willing to let go of that and go back to somewhat a more basic "hear, see, feel" sensory types of issues, I think there's going to need to be fairly, as you said, strong sense of trust and rapport, and they'll open up. 

01:23:10
ALLEN IVEY I guess we might disclose with that as if the real need... (crosstalk) 

01:23:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:23:15
ALLEN IVEY ...for us to learn to develop new forms of trust. 

01:23:15
HODGES GLENN  All right. 

01:23:20
ALLEN IVEY Thanks, Hodges. 

01:23:20
HODGES GLENN Thank you, Allen. 

01:23:20
End Multicultural Development Commentary on Segment 

01:23:20
ALLEN IVEY  Hodges and I have really been reviewing some of that material on the tape you're about to see, and we want to throw in some cautions in some issues in working with post traumatic stress disorder. Ah, the images issue Hodges can certainly get some clients going. I might talk a little bit about how that might be handled some of your own with that, ah, 'coz we might, ah, open, even open the door for issues for people sometime out of these images. 

01:23:50
HODGES GLENN Yes, Allen, it's true. In working with an individual who has post traumatic stress disorder, when they begin to recreate the situation through visual imagery, one needs to be very cautious regarding their response. It can evoke a lot of raw emotion which can be overwhelming for the individual, at which point, the clinician may need to stop the process and deal with that material on the spot. It's my recommendation that you allow the client to set the pace for that particular part of the process, thereby letting the therapist be a interpreter of the client's information. This way you can help keep the situation from becoming a bad experience for the client. 

01:24:55
ALLEN IVEY And I think part of that is the issue of pieces of experience, ah, rather than trying to take in to the whole traumatic event all at once. The person sometimes may want take a piece of the experience and open the door so to speak just a tad. Another thing that sometimes happens, we find, we found an imagery were, both Hodges and I, seen this experientially is that there, a person may experience in Vietnam, for example, and, ah, the, the emotional bombardment can come from an image, image. And then sometimes fused with that is experiences from early family experiences. Well, so you don't have just the, the trauma from Vietnam or the trauma from say, a intrusiveness of a rape, intrusiveness of something else, when you get in this type of work, you can bring in childhood stuff as well. How about that Hodges? 

01:25:40
HODGES GLENN Yes, Allen, I agree. In dealing with those events that have an extraordinary quality, ah, they make an individual more at risk for post traumatic stress disorder. When you are in the process of debriefing or counseling that individual, it's very prudent to be aware of that and to let the person work with bits and pieces. 

01:26:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. And I guess part of that too is be aware that the DCT questioning experience and the imagery is one part of a total treatment plan. Don't think of this as a total thing. Ah, think about relaxation training, stress management training seems to be an important part of that, I saw our recent study recently where women that had been raped, ah, something like, ah, 90 percent of women who've been raped show full signs of, at least some signs of post traumatic stress disorder. Evidence is that relaxation training, stress inoculation, assertiveness training, thought stopping, and so forth, is a treatment of choice for many of these women, these seem to help. ah, that's just one form of treatment for dealing with this. There's other forms of treatment as well. Ah, there were some other forms of treatment. Others don't think of the stuff we're demonstrating now as the only one. There were some other things you've found particularly important. 

01:26:50
HODGES GLENN  I found, ah, as he said, things like relaxation, ah, a behavioral sensitization hierarchy. I found that very useful. Uhm, some cognitive restructuring, ah, covert sensitization techniques. Those are things that we have been using at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks. 

01:27:15
ALLEN IVEY And beyond I think there's also, ah, ah, the issue of action. Sometime, a lot of Vietnam veterans have found meaning in going out and helping others who've had similar types of problems. Adult, children, or alcoholics would get together in organized programs that help others. Whole idea of moving beyond oneself and transcending seem to be another part of treatment. So with these caveats and maybe Hodges might ask some of the things at the end. That's, I'm about, is that all I wanted to say, is it? Let's take a look at the tape we have in applications of, ah, DCT to post traumatic disorder. And again, kind of my final thing is watch out for these techniques 'coz they do bring about regression and a lot of, ah, very strong emotional stuff. Any final things you'd like to say? 

01:27:55
HODGES GLENN  Just, ah, reiterate the caution and prudence on the part of the therapist in working with the individual. 

01:28:05
ALLEN IVEY And certainly in the early stages, supervision, consultation. 

01:28:05
HODGES GLENN  Yes. 

01:28:10
ALLEN IVEY And I guess awareness of your own experience. 

01:28:10
HODGES GLENN Absolutely. 

01:28:10
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:28:10
Integration of DCT Skills: Post Traumatic Stress Hodges Glenn Allen Ivey 

01:28:10
ALLEN IVEY  In this next tape, (crosstalk) 

01:28:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:28:35
ALLEN IVEY we're gonna see some segments from a demonstration interview focusing on the issues of post traumatic stress disorder. Ah, Vietnam vets in particular are noted for having this particular problem, the startle response, the recall, ah, generalized anxiety, etc. 

01:28:50
Many forms of trauma 

01:28:50
ALLEN IVEY At the same time, we should keep in mind that many other clients, rape victims, trauma victims, victims of hostage, kids who've been experiencing child abuse, or adults that experienced child abuse in different of ways experience this. One of my colleagues, ah, points out in some way virtually every one of us has been maltreated in some way. 

01:29:10
GOAL: MOVE FROM DENIAL TO ACCEPTANCE ~ TRANSCENDENCE 

01:29:10
ALLEN IVEY At issue for us is to move beyond denial and partial examination to looking at the trauma, more specifically what happened. That would be a level 3 response on the, on a scale. Finally, we really wanna move is what, to levels four and five, what Viktor Frankl would call transcendence. And over the progress of an interview or a series of therapy session, you can see this type of movement. So all of us have had traumatic experiences and Vietnam vets for example are not really all that unusual. The manifest, the trauma, perhaps a little more dramatic way. Who, so you see now is sort of some cuts and pieces from a demonstration interview. And highlighted on the tape will be some of the developmental therapy skills and concepts. Also we'll be pointing out on the tape the cognitive level in which the client is responding. 

01:30:05
COUNSELOR We've been here now in the hospital for a week, a second time we got together. 

01:30:10
Second interview 

01:30:10
COUNSELOR Ah, how are things for you this week? 

01:30:10
HODGES GLENN Well, little better, you know. They're talking to me. I'm trying to fit things. Get some perspective on things, yeah. Yeah, just, things don't make sense yet, you know. 

01:30:25
COUNSELOR Things don't make sense. Could you go a little further with that? 

01:30:30
HODGES GLENN Well- 

01:30:30
PREOPERATIONAL PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN CONCRETE AND FORMAL TERMS 

01:30:30
HODGES GLENN - my experiences in Vietnam, and they just, they've affected me so that it is hard to, to be around people. It's hard to go places. You know, I tried to get that job in construction and that, you know, 'coz I used to be a heavy equipment operator, and, but the loud noises, I just, I just keep having these flashbacks, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:30:55
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:30:55
HODGES GLENN ...I hear at them, you know, the machines going off or, you know, I wanna hit the, God, I mean, I've actually hit the dirt, you know, ah, on the, the construction site, and, you know, the foreman just, he, he just can't tolerate that. I mean, I seem to be more of a, (sighs) more of a risk to people there, you know, than I'm a help. So I had to stop that job. 

01:31:15
COUNSELOR So you stopped that job and then you decided to enter in here. (crosstalk) 

01:31:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:31:20
COUNSELOR  Could you back to that situation that last time- 

01:31:25
Concrete examination 

01:31:25
COUNSELOR - on the jobs. It could be a little bit, it could be a little heavy for you. (crosstalk) 

01:31:25
HODGES GLENN  Yeah. 

01:31:30
COUNSELOR What can you. 

01:31:30
HODGES GLENN It was pretty, pretty intense, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:31:30
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:31:30
HODGES GLENN Ah, the, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:31:35
COUNSELOR What was happening just before, ah. 

01:31:35
HODGES GLENN I was helping some guys carry some, you know, this big container's motor, you know, for mixing the cement, for that construction at high rise, and, ah, I was just walking pass, uhm, one of these crazy was lifting a large case of, of, ah, I guess it is girders, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:31:55
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:31:55
HODGES GLENN It wasn't that heavy but it was, you know, it's fairly substantial, he was lifting up and the chain broke. I mean no one should, I mean it's great no one should, was around there 'coz you got someone who could have gotten seriously hurt but, you know, it hit the ground, you know, I just, it was so, it's like I couldn't control it. What I heard wasn't the girder's fall, and what I hear was a loud sound going off, and, you know, some of those small landmines round, I mean that's what they sounded like, and I just hit the dirt, you know, and, ah, you know, just everyone is just a little startled in my response, you know, because, ah, they knew what was going on, and I mean I was glad they weren't hurt, but, ah, they're just, ah, shook everybody else up and. 

01:32:40
COUNSELOR  Could you go a little bit more 'til you hit the dirt, and... (crosstalk) 

01:32:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:32:45
Move toward sensori-motor 

01:32:45
COUNSELOR ...ah, what was happening with you? What was going on inside your body? What were you hearing, what your feeling? I have to understand the way... (crosstalk) 

01:32:55
HODGES GLENN The only thing I could recall was I had to get down, and I mean it's so, it's, it's past the point where you don't think about it. It's so instinctual, it's so automatic. It's like, ah, survival because you knew at that point in your life, the training you got, which was very simplistic was the difference a lot of times and people coming back on a daily basis. (crosstalk) 

01:33:15
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:33:15
HODGES GLENN And I recall- 

01:33:20
Formal pattern 

01:33:20
HODGES GLENN - you know, people who didn't hit the ground fast enough were usually the ones who got hit with some of the rounds that were going off or from the concussion and the explosion, or, you know, and I just, there was just too much death around, and that seemed to be one to survive. (crosstalk) 

01:33:30
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Now, I hear you, I hear that, it must have been just an incredible experience to, huh, have felt that. I mean, very fuzzy. (crosstalk) 

01:33:40
HODGES GLENN It was a, I mean now I'm at the point where I can talk about it some, ah,- 

01:33:45
CIS Level 2: Partial Examination 

01:33:45
HODGES GLENN - it, it's hard to explain. It's like your whole body just, just, there's nothing I can say or put into words. It's hard to describe how it feels. You just. (crosstalk) 

01:34:00
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Okay. I, I know that there are no words. (crosstalk) 

01:34:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:34:05
COUNSELOR There are no words... (crosstalk) 

01:34:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:34:05
COUNSELOR  to describe. (crosstalk) 

01:34:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:34:10
COUNSELOR What occurred to you. Does that makes sense? 

01:34:10
HODGES GLENN Yes. That's, that's accurate. I mean that's, that's true. It's, it's. 

01:34:15
COUNSELOR Okay. 

01:34:15
Re-enactment of trauma which follows on tape must be done with care and sensitivity to the unique client 

01:34:15
COUNSELOR Now what I'd like to do, before I do it, I'd like to tell what's going to happen. I really like to go back and ask you to re-experience, ah, what was happening with you. (crosstalk) 

01:34:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:34:30
COUNSELOR  When you heard that loud sound. We won't worry about Vietnam now. 

01:34:35
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:34:35
COUNSELOR Just want you to allow yourself to feel it. (crosstalk) 

01:34:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:34:40
COUNSELOR And if it feels too much, say, "That's enough." 

01:34:45
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:34:45
COUNSELOR Okay. Now I'd like you, maybe from, first of all, just to close your eyes little bit. And you're there on the construction scene. (crosstalk) 

01:34:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:34:55
COUNSELOR And things are going okay. You're getting along. You're apparently okay with the guys as you said. You're feeling okay. And then, and how are you feeling in your body's is, is, did you think about that scene and things are okay? 

01:35:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Just kind of moving around- 

01:35:15
Sensori-motor experience 

01:35:15
HODGES GLENN - doing what I have to do. 

01:35:15
COUNSELOR Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:35:15
HODGES GLENN I can feel the weight of the (sighs) this concrete sack I'm walking with. I know, it's heavy and I got these gloves on so I won't get my hands all messed up. Uh hmm. 

01:35:25
COUNSELOR Okay. And now I'd like you to run through in slow motion. (crosstalk) 

01:35:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:35:30
"Slow motion" recall can intensify experience 

01:35:30
COUNSELOR And just allow yourself to hear that sound. And then notice what's, what your feeling in your body, and just, you know, be a little bit, a little bit tense but I'm here. And it's part of learning how to cope wit this. Okay? (crosstalk) 

01:35:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:35:50
[sil.] 

01:35:50
COUNSELOR  I'm here, Hodges. I'm here in this room. (crosstalk) 

01:36:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:36:10
COUNSELOR  Could you tell what, what occurred for you? 

01:36:15
BY ASKING, "WHAT OCCURRED FOR YOU?," THE INTERVIEWER MOVES FROM SENSORI-MOTOR EXPERIENCE TO RECALL AND CONCRETE DISCUSSION THUS ENABLING THE CLIENT TO DISTANCE HIMSELF SOMEWHAT FROM THE STRONG EXPERIENCE. 

01:36:15
HODGES GLENN It was like I was back in 'Nam. (crosstalk) 

01:36:20
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:36:20
HODGES GLENN You're walking along, you're in the bush, and then, and it was really dramatic at night because it would be so quiet. You wouldn't hear a sound. And then you'd see nothing but white, bright white. And then you'd hear the screaming and hollering, and, oh. When I had my eyes closed, what I saw was that bright white, that light, the noise when the rounds would go off. (sighs) And I think that's why I, I'm just remembered jumping or flinching because it was just, it was so bright, it startles you, it's like. (crosstalk) 

01:37:00
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:37:00
HODGES GLENN  You don't even know you're there for an instant. It's just blinding, it's overwhelming. (crosstalk) 

01:37:05
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. What did your body feel like when you got into that? Can you get into your body? This is a hard part sometimes. 

01:37:10
HODGES GLENN  It was like shock, ah,- 

01:37:15
Recall of sensori-motor experience 

01:37:15
HODGES GLENN - it was hard to feel anything at that moment. It was just so, all I can think of is like being shocked, putting your hand in a, in a light socket and getting jolted. (crosstalk) 

01:37:30
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:37:30
HODGES GLENN Uhm, but it just, that feels, ah, like a hundred times more powerful. It's just, I flinched because they, I could see it. You know, this bright white, and everything just, you couldn't see anything because of the explosion and the noise and the, ah, the color, it was, and I, that's why I hit the ground because you, at the instant you hear it, I mean it, that can be the difference. 

01:38:00
COUNSELOR And how? That feeling of sticking your hand in the light socket, and that hundred times buzz, that's a pretty powerful image. Ah, my feeling is as I look at you, it's there, but it's not fully there. Is that right? 

01:38:20
HODGES GLENN (sighs) Yeah, I mean I still, I block it out. I mean, I, I think it's, it's, it's very scary because I feel very out of control when that happens. I mean. (crosstalk) 

01:38:35
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:38:35
HODGES GLENN I'm walking along on the site like everybody else and I hear this noise, and, sure everybody else looks around, but I'm the only one on the ground crouched up like a infant, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:38:45
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:38:45
HODGES GLENN Shaking like a leaf. I mean it's. (crosstalk) 

01:38:50
COUNSELOR I noticed that you had a, you looked to me like you had a fairly powerful experience there but I didn't see you crouching on the ground now. 

01:38:55
Client experienced a "piece" of the depth of sensori-motor level which is a step close to level 3 acceptance It may be necessary to have many sessions of partial examination of an issue before moving to CIS level 4 or transcendence. 

01:38:55
HODGES GLENN  No, I'd, I guess I wanna get past it. I gotta be able to put this past me. I gotta get on... (crosstalk) 

01:39:15
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:39:15
HODGES GLENN ...with, with life, and maybe a part of me just doesn't wanna go back there. Just, you know, wants to block it out. 

01:39:20
COUNSELOR At the same time and when the, you say part of you doesn't wanna go back there, but right here and now with me- 

01:39:25
Reinforcing experience 

01:39:25
COUNSELOR - at least of you went back there. Is that right? 

01:39:25
HODGES GLENN Right. Yeah. You're right. 

01:39:30
COUNSELOR And so one of the things we're about in this treatment series is to, you know, I do it all at once, but bits and pieces of going back... (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:39:35
COUNSELOR ...and putting it together. How do you feel right now in your body as we're talking? Can you get into your body? 

01:39:45
Here and now sensori-motor 

01:39:45
COUNSELOR What are you feeling? 

01:39:45
HODGES GLENN I'm feeling a little nervous, a little uneasy. Ah, it's, I feel kinda like, uhm, playing with the matches, and I might get burned, and I can't really, for some reason I can't control how, how to, I can't control this, I can't control the fire. I just... (crosstalk) 

01:40:05
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:40:05
HODGES GLENN ...it feels very risky. 

01:40:05
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Well, one of the things we're gonna be doing in this next couple of weeks. We're gonna start working on a couple issues on anxiety management. 

01:40:15
Concrete portion of treatment plan 

01:40:15
COUNSELOR Now that won't take care of it all, but we're gonna be doing some relaxation training, and some, and some, some basically stress inoculation. (crosstalk) 

01:40:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:40:25
COUNSELOR At the same time I'll be working with you to re-experience these things. Not just with me but with other vets as well. So we're working on that. (crosstalk) 

01:40:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:40:35
COUNSELOR Now let's imagine that we're continuing this interview and, ah, we're three weeks later, and you've done some of these stuff. 

01:40:45
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:40:45
COUNSELOR Ah, you've gone home for a visit. (crosstalk) 

01:40:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:40:45
COUNSELOR  And like you, this time to say that everything went fine- 

01:40:50
Three Weeks Later 

01:40:50
COUNSELOR  -a little bit more. 

01:41:00
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:41:00
COUNSELOR Ah, so Hodges, ah, we've talking, ah, we've gone through the anxiety management program and... (crosstalk) 

01:41:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:41:05
COUNSELOR ...we've talked and we've gone back and we've experienced some of those feelings and... (crosstalk) 

01:41:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:41:10
COUNSELOR And we, we tried you at home this past week, ah, with your family. How did it go? 

01:41:15
HODGES GLENN Ah, it was better. Uhm, things a little better. 

01:41:20
COUNSELOR  Your wife called in, ah, to the nurse and she said that, ah, in some ways times are better, but, ah, you seem pretty angry and (inaudible ) after the kids? 

01:41:38
HODGES GLENN  Well, you know, fitting back in is hard. I mean it's, sometimes I wonder if you would just, wouldn't be better to go back. 

01:41:45
COUNSELOR All right. 

01:41:45
HODGES GLENN  Because there are problems here. I mean (smirks) problems with family, problems at work. And, uhm, not everyone is that sympathetic to me having been in the war... (crosstalk) 

01:42:05
COUNSELOR Is this. (crosstalk) 

01:42:05
HODGES GLENN ...to begin with. So it's, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:42:05
COUNSELOR Yeah, (inaudible ) sometimes you said that, that your wife is, ah, you feel sometime just causing some of the difficulties. 

01:42:10
HODGES GLENN  Yeah- 

01:42:15
Formal 

01:42:15
HODGES GLENN - definitely. I mean sometimes I don't think she understands. Uhm, I know she'd put its up with a lot because when I'd do have these periods as we call them, you know, it gets, ah, it gets really scary for her, for the kids and, you know, uhm, when I get angry I think that's what scares people most of all because, uhm, I know my anger used to be much more volatile. 

01:42:40
COUNSELOR Now your wife actually said that she was a little frightened this last week. (crosstalk) 

01:42:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:42:45
COUNSELOR Ah, You would said that things really weren't that, so on one hand your wife said she was frightened. (crosstalk) 

01:42:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:42:50
COUNSELOR On the other hand, you say that things weren't that bad. 

01:42:55
HODGES GLENN No. uhm,- 

01:42:55
Moving toward CIS level 3: Acceptance 

01:42:55
HODGES GLENN  -I mean it could be a lot worse. I mean I used to break things, throw things, I used to hit the kids. Now I don't. Now I yell and scream. So... (crosstalk) 

01:43:10
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:43:10
HODGES GLENN  I'm not perfect. I gotta get it out somehow. 

01:43:15
Two Weeks Later After Client Returns from Outdoor Survival Program - Note Improvement on CIS to Level 4 

01:43:15
COUNSELOR  Hodges now we're getting toward the sixth week of the program. Ah, you went out for the, ah, you know, the outdoor survival program we've been trying. 

01:43:35
HODGES GLENN Right. 

01:43:35
COUNSELOR  That seem to go pretty well for you, didn't it? 

01:43:40
HODGES GLENN Yeah, it was, ah,- 

01:43:40
CIS level 4: New dimensions 

01:43:40
HODGES GLENN - it kinda demonstrated that I am getting a handle on things. That, ah, when I hear loud noises I don't hit the dirt or if I do it's not because of a, ah, a flashback. It's because, ah, I did hit the dirt. (laughs) 

01:43:55
COUNSELOR You hit the dirt. (laughs) 

01:43:55
HODGES GLENN  So, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:44:00
COUNSELOR Well. 

01:44:00
HODGES GLENN ah, I just feel a little more normal like I'm beginning to fit in again. 

01:44:05
COUNSELOR And, and how did it feel being with the guys on this trip this time? 

01:44:10
HODGES GLENN It felt real good. 

01:44:10
CIS level 4 

01:44:10
HODGES GLENN We felt like buddies, you know, uhm, I mean there's a distinct difference that 'Nam, but I'm able to see the difference now. I'm able to feel like that's my past. And this is how I'm living in the present. 

01:44:25
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Now one thing I've seen that you seemed to like helping some of the new guys coming in on the war. How does that feel to you when you come in and talk to them about some of their experiences? 

01:44:35
HODGES GLENN It feels good. Ah, everybody needs some help. I mean people had been very helpful and supportive with me, and I know at times I was not cooperative. I mean, my wife write to this place. I just, you know, coming around is hard even when you know it's good for you. (crosstalk) 

01:44:55
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:44:55
HODGES GLENN I kinda wanna help the new guys try to find themselves too. Get it past, get, just get past that experience, you know, it's, it's tough. 

01:45:05
COUNSELOR So, so one thing seems to be happening is getting out with the guys... (crosstalk) 

01:45:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:45:10
COUNSELOR ...and, and helping other people seems to be useful for you. 

01:45:15
HODGES GLENN Oh yeah. 

01:45:15
COUNSELOR Another real tough one is- 

01:45:15
Family may also need treatment 

01:45:15
COUNSELOR  -how can we take some of these stuff home with your own family because sometimes one's own family is the, is the toughest combat situation of all. 

01:45:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. That's true. (crosstalk) 

01:45:30
COUNSELOR 'Coz you're really close. 

01:45:30
HODGES GLENN That's true. Yeah. I know, well just the things of being more helpful supportive for my wife, ah, trying to understand my kids a little better, being more patient, uhm, controlling my temper. Those are the things that clearly the guys in the room were talking about. (crosstalk) 

01:45:50
COUNSELOR I'll stay with controlling the temper thing, that's been a really critical issue for you all along. (crosstalk) 

01:45:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:45:55
COUNSELOR Ah, a couple of times I think you start to blow out there, what have you been able to do here on the program and also in the, in an outward bound program... (crosstalk) 

01:46:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:46:05
COUNSELOR ...that, what helps you control your temper? 

01:46:05
HODGES GLENN Well, I, ah, I kinda give myself a, as we were talking about it, give me some little techniques to use but I, I give myself a time out when I feel my, I'm really in touch with how I'm feeling and, ah, when I feel myself getting worked up about something you know and when there's something or- 

01:46:25
Dialectic/systemic 

01:46:25
HODGES GLENN - someone said or even when I feel like I'm gonna have a flashback, I feel like I, I'm getting more of a sense of what's precipitating, what's causing it. (crosstalk) 

01:46:35
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:46:35
HODGES GLENN And, ah, when I get those feelings, you know, my stomach gets real tight and it's hard to swallow, I know I'm getting angry, I know I'm getting upset, and, and I tell myself back off, back off, so I walk away from the situation, or I, as usual I do, I just tell people back off. (crosstalk) 

01:46:55
COUNSELOR Ah, you're doing it again Hudges, ah, I think you're talking less about some of the things you do... (crosstalk) 

01:47:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:47:00
COUNSELOR ...but you're also missing one of the really critical things which I think you've really working on here is- 

01:47:05
To reach Level 5 of the CIS often requires examination of personal meanings - finding some positives in formerly totally negative situations. 

01:47:05
COUNSELOR You feel pride abut what you did for your country in Vietnam, it had to be done, we can argue... (crosstalk) 

01:47:10
HODGES GLENN Yeah. 

01:47:10
COUNSELOR ...back and forth. 

01:47:10
HODGES GLENN  Yeah I do. I do. (crosstalk) 

01:47:15
COUNSELOR Can you look at me and say that you feel proud if you did what you had to do? 

01:47:15
HODGES GLENN Yeah, I feel proud- 

01:47:15
Pride is common in Vets 

01:47:15
HODGES GLENN - about what I did, definitely. 

01:47:20
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:47:20
HODGES GLENN I would do it again if they asked me. 

01:47:20
COUNSELOR  So you have some strengths? 

01:47:25
HODGES GLENN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:47:25
COUNSELOR Not just somebody cowering down there, it's somebody who had the guts... (crosstalk) 

01:47:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:47:30
COUNSELOR In order to do that. You feel that don't you? 

01:47:30
HODGES GLENN Yeah, I do. (crosstalk) 

01:47:30
COUNSELOR Now, stay with that feeling, 'coz that's the feeling I really wanna sink in and we'll work on that. What is that feeling of hanging under the most stressful conditions? Hitting the dirt makes sense doesn't it? 

01:47:40
HODGES GLENN Yeah, it does. It's a survival- 

01:47:45
Survival has a positive meaning 

01:47:45
HODGES GLENN - I mean it's a, it's just survival, it's instinct, you know. 

01:47:45
COUNSELOR  So I'll just ask tremendous powers of instincts to survival and those can be used. 

01:48:00
HODGES GLENN Yeah, yeah. 

01:48:00
COUNSELOR You can get by a really stressful stuff. (crosstalk) 

01:48:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:48:05
Sensori-motor positive image 

01:48:05
COUNSELOR  Sink that into your own body, where does it sit? Just stay in that image of you as a survivor. 

01:48:20
[sil.] 

01:48:20
COUNSELOR  What's happening? 

01:48:25
CIS: Level 5/Transcendence 

01:48:25
HODGES GLENN I feel I'm very strong, very, ah, it's powerful. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:48:30
COUNSELOR  So it isn't just anxiety management, it isn't just control, it isn't just the buddies. (crosstalk) 

01:48:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:48:40
COUNSELOR It's noticing that you have some strengths and qualities of survival. We'll work more on that later. 

01:48:45
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:48:45
COUNSELOR Thanks for the day. 

01:48:45
HODGES GLENN  Thank you. 

01:48:50
Debriefing of Interview 

01:48:50
COUNSELOR  Hodges, well, you're just been doing a little debriefing of the interview beside... (crosstalk) 

01:48:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:48:55
COUNSELOR ...it might be good to get some of that on the screen. What stood out for you from that session that we did? 

01:49:00
HODGES GLENN Ah, a number of things stood out for me Allen, one of the things was, uhm, how I was feeling trying to portray some of the clients I've worked with and, ah, I felt like I was protecting myself that I wasn't really ground in myself particularly the sensorimotor stuff. (crosstalk) 

01:49:25
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:49:25
HODGES GLENN Uhm, I can come up with a very clear concrete examples because I've heard so many but when it came to feeling it I really stop myself short of it because it was just as real powerful, it's, it, it, I, I only think of like primal, something that's so clearly instinctual, almost computer-like, you know, analytical, survival. It's just, and it's impressive to see, that when you talked about helping them refrain that experience in terms of pride. I think that's where a lot of the anger and maybe some denial is, is feeling that they are very proud of what they did and a lot of them to my surprise would do it again, they say it, that's not what bothers them, what bothers them is the lack of acceptance they're getting from society and support from that issue and, ah, uhm, that's it. (crosstalk) 

01:50:20
COUNSELOR I think that's, I'm breaking it, I think particularly important, ah, Pearl Harbor vets still had the same type of flashbacks... (crosstalk) 

01:50:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:50:30
COUNSELOR ...that come with them. 

01:50:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:50:30
COUNSELOR The distinction is that Pearl Harbor vet, when the attack of the Japanese in... (crosstalk) 

01:50:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:50:35
COUNSELOR ...Pearl Harbor, we takes some pride and satisfaction in this... (crosstalk) 

01:50:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:50:40
COUNSELOR ...and so it doesn't produce quite the same discreet and yet the same level of problem, at the same time we also know that Pearl Harbor vets now are really victims of post traumatic stress disorders, it was missed for years. 

01:50:50
HODGES GLENN Right. 

01:50:50
COUNSELOR So, but this feeling of pride as seem the important thing you picked up in them... (crosstalk) 

01:50:55
HODGES GLENN Yes. 

01:50:55
COUNSELOR ...you also said it's very difficult to get dealing with the sensorimotor. (crosstalk) 

01:51:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:51:00
COUNSELOR One of the reasons, as I've been thinking about trauma, we don't have words to describe trauma. And I think sensorimotor, expressive therapies, group experiences, ah, purification rituals I think are really important... (crosstalk) 

01:51:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:51:15
COUNSELOR ...in helping people deal with some of the deeper aspects of trauma. What are some of your other observations? 

01:51:20
Need for multi-level treatment plan 

01:51:20
HODGES GLENN  Uhm, suggestions also with in terms of interventions, the group experience is very important to them particularly, to be able to talk about it with other veterans having had the same... (crosstalk) 

01:51:35
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:51:35
HODGES GLENN ...type of experience. That seems to be very, very powerful with them. Ah, using stress inoculation, and other forms, relaxation, training... (crosstalk) 

01:51:45
COUNSELOR Hhmm. 

01:51:45
HODGES GLENN ...is real important, because it helps them lower their anxiety levels down to a point where they can manage and focus on some of the more deeper issues. (crosstalk) 

01:51:55
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

01:51:55
HODGES GLENN Ah, to those, those who, some of many things that really stick out for me in in that interaction. 

01:52:00
COUNSELOR  In terms of, ah, a DCT model you'd likely experience the sensory motor issues. (crosstalk) 

01:52:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:52:10
COUNSELOR Ah, that involves really re-experiencing the trauma. (crosstalk) 

01:52:10
HODGES GLENN Yes. (inaudible ) 

01:52:14
COUNSELOR  Anxiety management... (crosstalk) 

01:52:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:52:15
COUNSELOR ...skills training, assertiveness training as it is, at the, at the concrete level. (crosstalk) 

01:52:15
HODGES GLENN  Uh hmm. 

01:52:20
COUNSELOR Looking at yourself. I think the group work is working into dialectic and looking at society's impact. (crosstalk) 

01:52:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:52:25
COUNSELOR But, under girding that I think, there's a need for pride and what one has done. 

01:52:30
HODGES GLENN Yeah, I really think that's a major thing because, ah, in talking with them, that's, its just, continuous. I hear it over and over again that, uhm, they would have liked to been accepted more that peoples perception of that war is much different than you said, you know the pearl harbor experience and, ah, ah, and I think because of that, you know, some of these issues that they're bringing up are real and it needs to be addressed so, uhm, this was good it really help me get a prospective on another prospective on how to approach it when I went to them. 

01:53:10
COUNSELOR Thanks Hodges. 

01:53:10
HODGES GLENN Thank you.
