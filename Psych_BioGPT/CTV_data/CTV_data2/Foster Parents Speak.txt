00:00:00
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN I have been a foster parent for close to ten years. 

00:00:00
ROSE KARLUK We've had 80-some children through our house. 

00:00:05
KELLY GRAVEN We have ended up adopting two sibling sets. 

00:00:10
VIRGINIA MISTRY Foster parents and birth parents need to have a strong relationship that's as good as you can make it. 

00:00:15
TAMMARA PICKARD When you take a child into your home, you're also taking in that family. 

00:00:20
BRENDA CRUMP Kid yourself not, it is a lot of work. 

00:00:20
THOMASENA NEWTON It might be one child at a time, but you make that difference.

FOSTER PARENTS SPEAK Crossing Bridges & Fostering Change 

00:00:30
It Takes More Than Love 

00:00:30
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN You must be ready for this job, that is the first thing. It is a great challenge. 

00:00:45
CHRIS FAHY Being a parent, I think, is the toughest job in the world and it uh, takes everything. 

00:00:50
ROSE KARLUK It's the vision that I have to be able to, to supply a safe place for a child or um, be there, you know, for them when they need, when they have a need. 

00:01:00
TAMMARA PICKARD Sometimes it's a long, hard road. 

00:01:05
THOMASENA NEWTON You gotta have a well made-up mind to be willing to share your heart and your soul, your house, whatever you got. Your beds, your cookies, the things that you used to say are mine, now you have say they're ours. 

00:01:20
BRENDA CRUMP People always say to me, "oh, you must love children". And I kinda really hate to hear that, because it takes more than love to care for children. They think love is just it-it's love, it's devotion, dedication, support, sacrifice. 

00:01:40
JANET HENRY When you decide to go in this, um, be wide open for whatever can happen, 'cause there are gonna be lots of experiences, good and bad. But in my experience, the good has always outweighed the negative. 

00:02:05

00:02:05
Keeping Kids Connected 

00:02:05
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN We are fostering, helping, bridging a gap, helping to have these children go back home, that is our first job. And if we can get that first, then the other things will be easier. 

00:02:20
VIRGINIA MISTRY Of the seven children that we've fostered, two have gone home. So, obviously they need not to be separated from there parents and then reunited, but they need to have a continuous good relationship with their parents. 

00:02:30
RENITA DAVIE You just have to focus that foster means temporary, that their goal is to return home, to put yourself in their shoes, that no matter what happened in your life, you always wanna go home. And, so you have to move yourself outta the way and do whatever it takes to make it happen. 

00:02:55
CHRIS FAHY That's their mom, you don't pick 'em. That's your dad, you don't pick 'em. But you wanna go back with 'em and you love 'em. 

00:03:00
ROSE KARLUK I think a lot of it too, is involving the parent in every aspect of the child's life, ed- you know, educationally, um, when it comes to their health. All the issues that, that the pa-, that the child would have with their parent at home, that parent should have the right to be involved with those same issues even when the child is outside of the home. 

00:03:25
BRENDA CRUMP Know from the beginning that that relationship, that connection of that child and their, uh, birth family or caregiver, uh, wherever they're coming from, um, is important. And an effort should be made to, um, make, keep that connection. 

00:03:45
VIRGINIA MISTRY And for the kids who are going on to be adopted, um, they also as you said, they need to know that where they came from was okay, that their birth parents were people who cared about them and who loved them. 

00:04:00
ROSE KARLUK When the child sees you working together for their best interest, it makes them more comfortable, it makes them feel more safe, um, and it gives them a-a healthier attitude about what's happening in their life. 

00:04:15

Crossing Bridges 

00:04:15
TIM FAHY She was a foster kid and we just had her first birthday party. She's 40, could you believe it? 

00:04:25
CHRIS FAHY Oh, thanks. 

00:04:25
TIM FAHY She never had a birthday party her whole life and all the kids were singing and she was crying. 

00:04:30
CHRIS FAHY Foster care was different 40 years ago [laughs], a lot different. 

00:04:35
ROBERT VOSS In my foster parent training, and this was 1995-1996, I don't believe there was any mention of any attempts at interaction with the biological family. We were just an entity isolated in time and not related to anything else in the child's life. 

00:05:05
KELLY GRAVEN Because I was new at fostering, I wasn't really sure, you know, how to approach the relationship and I really didn't have a lot of advice. I di-, I wasn't encouraged to have a relationship with her. Um, my instincts told me that it was best to have a relationship, a good one, with her. 

00:05:25
CHRIS FAHY We had um, three foster care children, they were siblings. And uh, the first time I had to meet mom, dad was out of the picture, I had to go to the prison, which for me alone was an experience. And I bring the kids in to meet the mom and immediately I could tell the mom just didn't like me, you know, so I was like, well. We had, this was our first chance to work with foster care, it was our first kid, so um, I was like well, this is what they taught us in the class is we gotta build a bond here. 

00:05:50
THOMASENA NEWTON I had to convince this lady that I'm not her enemy, I'm here to help her with her child. 

00:05:55
MAGGIE CAMPBELL You've gotta find a common ground and of course, this is a complete stranger. What is the common ground you have? It's the child. 

00:06:00
VIRGINIA MISTRY I can remember this mom was really angry that her kid had been taken. She was furious, she was suing everyone in the state. And she met me and she was ready to kill me and the first thing I said to her was, um, "What time does she usually go to bed?" and she looked at me as if I was crazy and then she started talking to me as a mom. 

00:06:25
THOMASENA NEWTON You have to talk with that person and let them know that I'm not here to come between you two, but I'm here the bridge be-, this child back to you. I will put as many boards as I have to put on this bridge to make you understand that I'm not here to take your child. 

00:06:40
TAMMARA PICKARD We had a birth parent that was doing absolutely excellent for ten months, it was just amazing. And the child was gonna be returned within a month, but then mom and dad regressed and had an incident and now the sibling came into care and I decided I'm gonna take a negative situation and make it positive by calling up the mom and saying, you know, I realize yo-you guys have, have fallen, what can I do to help? 

00:07:15
CHRIS FAHY Every week we sat the kids down on Saturday night and made them write a letter to their mom. And they'd write letters and now all the sudden, we started getting letters from mom. "Thank you", "you're in my prayers", "you're doing wonderful" and she got out, she did everything the county wanted her to do and she did very well. She got a beautiful apartment and everything. The kids, she got reunified the day before Thanksgiving with the kids and two months after that we got an invitation to go to their birthday party. 

00:07:40

00:07:40
Understanding Birth Parents 

00:07:40
VIRGINIA MISTRY When you think about birth parents, you think about the loss of control. I mean, suddenly someone has come into your house and taken away your child or your children. And you are helpless, you can do nothing and yo-you can feel how angry an-and hopeless people feel. 

00:08:00
ROBERT VOSS At my one meeting with the parents, they made it quite clear that they considered me part of the evil empire, the DA, DSS and myself who had taken away their children and they were very hostile towards me. 

00:08:15
RENITA DAVIE It-it can be frightening, um, starting a relationship with the birth parent because of the abuse that um, have been inflicted on the children or the neglect or just their lifestyle of, of violence and disrespect, so it's very frightening. 

00:08:35
JANET HENRY I think you have to be prepared in this particular job to take chances; to give folks a chance to prove to you, um, that I'm not going to take advantage of you. 

00:08:50
KELLY GRAVEN You know when you have a child, the one who has a zillion therapies, and the doctors say, well you know, he had a fractured skull twice before the age of two, it makes you angry. And every time he's having a hard time or he can't talk and his friends are making fun of him and his little heart is broken, how can I not be angry? And it makes it difficult to take that phone call. You know, when he's crying, your heart's broken for him and then mom calls and says, "oh, how are the kids?". You know, and then I do, you know, I-I don't say always what I wanna say, but there are times when honestly I wanna say, "not good". 

00:09:30
CHRIS FAHY As hard as this is, you gotta give mom and dad that second chance. You gotta, everybody has a second chance. 

00:09:35
MAGGIE CAMPBELL The child would come into the house, you'd hear this story of this horrific situation in this child's life and the parent is the bad guy. And not necessarily is the parent the bad guy, the parent, sometimes, is just as needy as that child is. 

00:09:50
VIRGINIA MISTRY I had one mom who was out of control all the time with her kid, and screaming at her kid and screaming at everybody. And then she said to me, "I hear myself talk and I don't want to say those things; I don't want to sound like that, but I can't help it". 

00:10:05
BRENDA CRUMP A lot of time the birth families don't have a lot of supports, so when um, that husband loses the job and now they've lost their apartment. Now, they're home-, just a-a trickle effect of things, domino effect is happening. Everyone has a breaking point I say. And I truly believe that it's just a matter of how much is put on and at what time and what support you have. How, just how far you can bend before you break. And I think that having that frame of mind is really good, this way I'm not judging the parents. 

00:10:35
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN A lot of foster parents have a mindset about the birth parents. They don't, they dislike the birth parents because you did this to this child, you're bad people. And we have to start before not judging them. 

00:10:45
VIRGINIA MISTRY When you meet the birth parents, if you can let go of these pre-conceived notions and you just see them as parents who do care about their kids, and I've never met a birth parent who didn't care about their kids. 

00:11:00
THOMASENA NEWTON We must remember mothers and fathers love their children regardless to whether they are cocaine-dependent or chemical-dependent or mental health issues or whatever that caused for them to break up in life. Whether they couldn't hold their families together, they love their children. 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:25
Visits Are Hard 

00:11:25
VIRGINIA MISTRY Visits are hard for the kids and they're really hard for the parents. And the kid senses it, I mean, the k-, a-, at goodbye time it's so hard. Sometimes you have to peel the kid off of the parent's neck and drag them away physically. 

00:11:40
MAGGIE CAMPBELL I-I have one child and I adore this child, but after a visit he would be so distraught that it would take me an hour-and-a-half to get home. He would be flipping himself over the seat, pounding his head against the wall, trying to rip the steering wheel away from me. 

00:12:00
VIRGINIA MISTRY The last little girl we had would cry for about 40 minutes after visit. Just sitting and crying, not raging and not angry, just sadness, just tears. And I cou-, she didn't want me to hold her. She didn't want anything, she wanted to be alone and she just cried. 

00:12:15
TAMMARA PICKARD We started doing visitation in our home for our child's sake. Um, you say you love these children, you have to show them that, you know, you're willing to do something that might make you uncomfortable. 

00:12:30
CHRIS FAHY We've done visitations at the county buildings supervised and we've supervised in our home and what I find is that the kids are more relaxed if they're at the home environment. Plus, they also see that if my mom and dad are coming to the home, obviously they gotta be comfortable with the people they work with. So it shows that we are a, we're working together. 

00:12:50
BRENDA CRUMP In some cases it's not gonna work, because a person may be violent, they may be hostile, they may be very angry. And you have to wait, you know, to kinda gradually go into it. It's not something you can just jump right into, say "hi, I'm the foster parent, come on over", but you're working to always have that in your mind that it needs, uh, to be done. 

00:13:05
RENITA DAVIE Well, we're much more comfortable now, you know, that we've done it. But, um, in the beginning, my husband is thinking, whoa, you know, this mother is an addict and are they gonna come back and start uh, casing the joint while they're here. 

00:13:25
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN It is touchy, but you have to be open and do this slowly. It-it takes time. So, by meeting outside first then gradually, you know, calling on the phone. I would say in a gradual thing to build that trust, and then you bring them into the home. 

00:13:40
CHRIS FAHY When we used to take 'em to McDonalds or the county or something like that, the kids are all, they're anxious all the way up there. They're worried about if I do this or say this how's my . . . when mom just shows up to the house it's, they're just normal. They're doing their thing, ther-they're playing and mom seems more relaxed with us. And it doesn't feel, if it's supervised, it doesn't feel supervised if they're in our home. 

00:14:00
RENITA DAVIE I just open the door, I welcome them and then I s-, I ask them . . . of course I find out in advance if it's, uh, supervised or unsupervised, can the child be alone with the parent. Um, if they say that the child can be alone, I tell them, you know, you're welcome here, um. I'm gonna step into the kitchen and start cooking or I have some ironing or just something to let 'em know that I'm right over here, you know. I can hear, but I'm not right in, you know, your business. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:35
Finding Support 

00:14:35
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN People ask me, "how can you do this? How..", I said, "I couldn't do it by myself". 

00:14:45
THOMASENA NEWTON You develop a good relationship with your case worker, it's very important 'cause that, we both supposed to be about the child's life, we're not supposed to be about our personal lives. We supposed to be about the children, so therefore you must develop relationships so you can talk to that person about that child and they talk to you. 

00:15:05
KELLY GRAVEN And I remember calling a case worker and it was like, this kid, I mean, he was four and he punched holes in the sheet rack and he was out of control. I didn't know what to do and I was like, "I need some help". 

00:15:15
CHRIS FAHY One of the case workers came to the house and explained to me about th-the Foster Care Association and she said, "get involved", she said, "you're getting involved with the Foster Care Association and when you need help, they'll be there to help", and they will educate you too. And, we made the phone call and we've been goin' strong. 

00:15:35
TIM FAHY And we've been involved and now it's reached a-another plateau, yo-you're helping all kinds of people, not only are you learning things. 

00:15:40
ROSE KARLUK An-and I echo, you know, getting involved with a Foster Parent Association group, um, there's a lot of, a lot of support there, a lot of encouragement, a lot of education. Um, somebody to come along side of you, somebody to give you advice. 

00:15:55
CHRIS FAHY So now we feel we got the support behind us, so when we make a decision, we don't feel like it's just us and the case worker, we're being informed. 

00:16:05
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN It's a lot to carry being a foster parent, you have a lot of issues to deal with and you need a break. So at times, we, there's respit, we need to call up on the resources to have the support in order for us to be effective. 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:25
Going Home 

00:16:25
RENITA DAVIE When my foster children are about to return home, I give them a letter and the letter talks about how they blessed my life while they were with us. And also, um, we talk about all the changes that they've made and how we're so excited to see um, how their mother's life is going to be better because they're more mature, more responsible, reliable, dependable. Um, it's a letter, it's written in a way that they can show it to their parents so that they feel proud. 

00:17:05
ROSE KARLUK Our first baby that was brought into our home, we had him for oh, almost two years and we had two of his other siblings. And when it was time for them to, to go home, the mom knew that I loved, had grown to love th-the other brother and sister, but this baby had been in a way, with me from birth 'til almost two years old so, he was part of my husband an-and my life in a real deep way and it was, it was so hard to give this baby up. 

00:17:35
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN When children leave our homes, we go through such losses and we have to, to mourn and to grieve that and a lot of times as foster parents, it is very difficult because everytime a child comes and go, we have to go through that loss, that cycle, and um, even for the child that left the home. For me, my child, when I had my kids for six uh, six or seven years and they went back home, it was a great loss for them, for me and for my daughter who grew up with them. 

00:18:05
JANET HENRY The child that has gone home, I have remained available to be a babysitter, to take the child over weekends, because I feel that the relationship that this child and I established back when she was in my home is still important today, it didn't end when she left my home. 

00:18:20
ROBERT VOSS And I am extremely grateful to his adoptive family that they have not only permitted, but they have encouraged his staying in contact with me. 

00:18:35
VIRGINIA MISTRY Every time we had a new foster child, I'd say to my husband, "now be nice to the birth parents" [laughing], because we want the kid to visit after they go home and we have had all of our foster kids still come to visit. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:18:55
One Life at a Time 

00:18:55
JANET HENRY I've got grandkids I never thought I'd have, I have children I never thought I'd have and it's, for me, it's been a wonderful experience and I appreciate the fact that I've had the privilege of being a mom to a lotta kids. 

00:19:15
ROSE KARLUK When she came home, I said, "if it were just for you, you know, these 18 years we've been in care and the things we've seen and the things we've had to go through, um, it's not always been enjoyable and there are many nights we stayed awake and there are many times we were in fear, you know, for-for your lives, but if it were just t-to see this little four-year-old grow into this beautiful bride, um, it was well worth it.". 

00:19:40
TAMMARA PICKARD It was worth every heartache that we had gone through to know she's, she's actually going home and I really feel it's gonna be successful. An-and that, you know, there's a good chance that she won't come back into the system because people are trying to do what's best and they were putting her feelings first. 

00:20:00
BRENDA CRUMP You know what, I often wondered at "would I do it again?". Yeah, I'd do it again, I'd do it again. If this is the outcome, I'd do it again. I'd go through the surf and I'd go through the late nights, I'd go through the aggravation, I'd do it again. 

00:20:10
THOMASENA NEWTON If you hang in there with the kids, you will get your joy because there are times in their life, you'll just see them and you'll be so, you'll just, it's like a healing that you never had before when you see the kids. 

00:20:25
CHRIS FAHY I don't think I'd be sitting here today if it wasn't for people like this that made a difference in my life and bring me here today, so I know what we're doing works. 

00:20:35
BEVERLY LEE-FLYNN We can't change the world, but we do our best one life at a time.
