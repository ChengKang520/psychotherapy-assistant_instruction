00:00:00
EDMUND GORDON  And I prepared, ah, I'd say a, a lovely paper, which, ah, we were debating whether I should, can you hear me? Yeah, ah, we were debating whether I should read it, and I certainly don't think all the, si, sit here, ah, this close to you and, and, and read something you can read yourself. Uhm, Brenda Mejia is on the corner here. If you want a copy of the paper, you can ask her, she'll send it to you. So, why don't I just, oh, thank you. Why don't I just, uhm, talk about what, uhm, I would have lectured about. In the 1991, I think it was, ah, when I retired from, from Yale, ah, incidentally, I'm an old man. My doctor tells me I am in much better shape physically than I have in the right to be. But I'm in my 9th decade and started trying to retire in '91 and have had several rehirements since then and probably, ah, should really take it seriously and quit. But, you know, I keep going. But in '91 when, ah, I retired, my family and several of my former students, ah, had a party, ah, conference, in which, ah, many of my students talked about the ways in which my work had influenced their work. And one of those students, ah, Professor Carol Yake(ph), who occupies an endowed chair down at Washington University now, ah, edited, those contributions on the book that is titled "Edmund Gordon, Knowing and Understanding." And that title an, actually came from a paper I had done for ARA, ah, few years before, which captured the theme that my former student, students claim, ah, had been the kinda cost(ph) that message as I meted them over the years, and that is that is not enough to know one also needs to understand. And in the process of knowledge production, what we are really about is trying to establish facts, you know, trying to confirm or disconfirm hypothesis. But that, that's the beginning step. The second step, and probably the more difficult part of, ah, knowledge production, has to deal with what it means. I'm trying to understand what it means. Now, now some years ago, I had, ah, unique experience of, ah, getting to know, the, ah, late W.E.B. DuBois. And for about five years, actually the last five years that he lived in this, ah, country, ah, we saw, saw a lot of each other. Excuse me. We saw a lot of each other, and, ah, I claim him as one of, one of my mentors. Ah, ca, come on in and, make yourself comfortable, we're doing this less formally than had been planned. But the DuBois used to argue that there was a responsibility that went along with knowledge, with knowing, and I'm having an understanding. And he said that responsibility, if you know, is to act. It's not enough to simply know something, but if you got knowledge, if you got insight, if you got understanding, then there's a mo, a moral responsibility to do something about, something about it. In the talk we prepared for today, what we're doing in that paper is looking at some of the efforts in psychology to know, and we are advocating efforts and understanding. And it happens that from our perspective, the movement toward a cultural psychology, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, moves us, moves us closer to understanding. Those of you, who have, ah, taken your history of psychology seriously, know that the feel kind of emerged out of, ah, philosophy, as, as we, ah, scholars of human behavior, modeling our work actively, natural scientist, tried to make a sciences of, ah, behavior that paralleled, no biology, physics, ah, the hard sciences. And of course the tradition of, ah, the scientific method, in modern times, is one of hypothesis gene, generating and hypothesis testing, hypothesis confirmation or disconfirmation. The notion is that there are universal laws underlying the phenomena of the world. And it is a task of science to understand these, to uncover them, early in my career, for my, ah, defined what I was about. I arg, argued that I was really trying to understand the mechanisms by which human behavior precedes. Let the assumption that if one understood those mechanisms, one could manipulate them in order to change, to improve behavior. It was some years later in my career that I began to realize, that simply understanding those mechanisms, ah, knowing those mechanisms was not enough, because one has to know what the process means to the person who's experiencing it. Kurt Lewin, this prob, and his, ah, follower, ah, Murray whose first name I can't remember at the moment, probably were the first of us, social scientists, to really take that problem seriously. If you remember, Lewin who came out of the natural scien, sciences, to the behavioral sciences, I think he was originally a physicist. And that's, in the study of human behavior, the notion of field theory, field theory borrowed it from physics which simply argues that any phenomenon exists in a field, field with many vectors. In fact, each phenomenon is one of those vectors. But in a field, if something happens to anyone of those vectors, it influences everything else in the field. And, moving from that perspective, Lewin came up with a little formula by which he explained human behavior. If I recall that one correctly, it's something like behavior is a function of environments and personal characteristics, ah, the key(ph) of it just to reverse P times E. B is a function of P times E. Behavior is a function of personal characteristics and environmental characteristics. Now his, his, ah, student, ah, colleague, Mu, Murray(ph), and I'm stumbling over whether Murray(ph) was his colleague or his student. I think he began as his student and became his colleague. But anyway, Murray took this notion and he said that there's something missing here. He felt that personal characteristics and environmental characteristics have two dimensions at least. There's a consensus dimension, ah, the chair here. Most of us in this room having had experiences with objects like this, we'd call as a chair, and, and well accept that. That is the consensus reality of that chair. But, but my wife and I, even though we've spent, what is it, 57, 58 years together, and may have different associations for that chair. Since she bore the, bore the children, and, you know, I, helped to discipline them, it may be that, that she used the chair and then there's the child. Her association with the chair would be different from mine if I used it to, ah, teach or scold, ah, or, or, spank, or, ah, ah, play with the child. The notion here that Murray was advancing is that the phenomena of the world have these dual existences. They have the things that humans kinda agree on the consensus dimension, and there is the idiosyncratic or existential, ah, dimension. He modified, ah, Lewin's formula to read behavior is a function of personal characteristics and personal characteristics, prime, and environmental characteristics, E, and environmental characteristics, prime. He later called those the alpha and beta presses of these two phenomena. But he suggested and Lewin, ah, advance the notion, suggested that in explaining behavior, one deals with the consensus characteristics of the phenomenon. But to really understand the behavior, one has to know the meaning of the behavior, the meaning of the characteristic for the person who's experiencing it. Now, some 30, 40 years, ah, later, ah, there was a person that all of you are familiar with, in counseling psychology, an existentialist, ah, can't remember his name at the moment either. But, ah, it's from the tip of my tongue. But, ah, but this, ah, ah, Chap argued that instead of trying to, ah, interpret, trying to, ah, get inside of the mind of the person of the one he's counseling with, what you want to do is to try to reflect the feelings of that person. Anybody remember who I'm talking about? 

00:11:40
 Carl Rogers. 

00:11:40
 Carl Rogers? 

00:11:45
EDMUND GORDON Carl, oh, Rogers, of course Carl Rogers. Carl Rogers applied this, this notion. He says that what you've really got to do is to understand how the client is experiencing this, the meanings that the client is assigning(ph). Because these so-called consensus meanings or official meanings or theoretical meanings now may, ah, work in our textbooks. But if I'm trying to help this woman with a particular problem, what is important is the way in which her experiences read by her and not how it's read by me. Even if she's wrong, ah, still the thing I've gotta work with is, ah, her re, her reality. Now, in the field of psychology, given this effort that, ah, trying to copy the, ah, natural sciences, we have focused excessively, I think, on trying to find consistencies, uniformities, ah, characteristics that permit five or six of us to see the phenomenon and study the phormonomen, phenomenon in the same way, because science is built upon the repli, replication of findings. If I've, ah, studied the phenomenon and come up with one set of, of, ah, conclusions, and Brenda comes, ah, takes the same phe, phenomenon and set this and comes up of another set of conclusions, that pe, presents problems for the scientific method. What we want is for her to be able to replicate the, ah, experiment that I've done, hopefully, to confirm that. And for some aspects of science, certainly for the physical sciences, it seems to have worked well until the molecular, ah, physicist and molecular biolo, biologist came along. And we discovered that there's a lot more variation even in the natural phenomena of the world than our early conceptions, ah, ah, suggested. Clearly, in human behavior, those variations are not only much, ah, more, ah, obvious, and plentiful. But because so much of human behavior fights(ph), because so much of them, of human behavior is, I'm sorry. 

00:14:15
 I think your mic (inaudible ). 

00:14:18
EDMUND GORDON  Ah, probably(ph) spoke, I gave you all those gems and nobody could hear them. 

00:14:25
 There is it. 

00:14:25
EDMUND GORDON Can you hear me now? 

00:14:25
 Yes, we do. 

00:14:25
EDMUND GORDON I'm sorry. Oh, I'm not sure what you missed. I've been trying to make the case, ah, for the tension between psychology as a natural science and psychology that they call it as a interpretational or hermeneutic science. There are aspects (clears throat) of the, of the world, and maybe even aspects of human behavior, that does lend themselves to the kind of, search for universal principles that have been the history of our, ah, field. But to make reference to the themes of, ah, this particular series of conferences, we are concerned with the fact that many of those universals, do not map easily on to the unique and idiosyncratic experiences of people who've experienced the world differently, or in particu, particular ways. Beginning in around '65 or '70, Carol Gilligan and the group of, ah, feminist behavioral scientists began to call our attention to the ways in which experience in a world as a female, influences the psychology of people that we call women, the fact that women experience the world in unique ways. Ah, Gilligan would, ah, argue, gives them, I think she said in a different voice or in another voice. She gives them another voice, gives them another vision of the world from the world, from the view of the world that has dominated, ah, through the eyes of men. And with about the same time, the, ah, African-American psychologists in this country outlines(ph) something called The Black Psychological Association or Association for Black Psychology, from much the same perspective. That if you are a Black person in this society, you are likely to experience the world differently, and that influ, influences, ah, your, our psychological understanding of that experience. Now, for a long time and still in the field, we have had trouble, ah, accepting that notion. I can remember the times when, I rejected some of that perspective, how much of that perspective, because I've thought as a psychologist, what I wanted to understand were the universal mechanisms by which one understands and explains human behavior being insensitive to the fact that maybe those hegemonic notions may not be sufficiently powerful, or sufficiently appropriate, to explain behaviors that they are unique. So that, ove, over the years in our field, we have had several, subdisciplines or approaches to psychology that have tried to deal with this problem. Ah, the one that, dominates and, ah, our department of counseling psychology here is a cross-cultural approach, where we've taught it important to do comparative studies looking at phenomena across cultures, trying to understand them from the unique perspective, that is provided by a particular culture, or a particular cultural experience, or cult, cultural identity. Another effort that, doing the same thing is the field that we call "Ethnopsychology." That is trying to apply the concepts that grow out of ethnic identity or the experiences that grow out of ethnic identity to the explanation of the behavior of persons who share that identity. Uh hmm. In this instance, instead of looking across, ah, groups of people across cultures or across, ah, ah, ethnic groups, we try to understand, ah, more deeply the behavior of a particular ethnic group. I can remember a paper I wrote, back in '57 or '58, in which I was arguing that the first thing that we needed to do in psychology before we did comparative studies was to understand the unique experience of a, of Black people, and to do in-depth studies of that population. That is in the ethnopsycholo, psychological tradition. Then we've got folk in anthropology who are psychologically oriented. Ah, Professor Harrington on our faculty is one of these. Chuck(ph) used to call himself a psychological anthropologist. My oldest son calls himself an economic anthropologist. I used to think it was just a field of, of Anthropology. But these folk are using the lenses of parallel disciplines to guide their work in Anthropology. And the psychological anthropologists were, were using the lenses of Psychology now to understand anthropological phenomena. Now despite many hours of, ah, debating the issue, I've never really understood from, ah, from Harrington the real difference between Cross-cultural Psychology and Psychological Anthropology. Their techniques, their strategies, and their concerns are much the same. Then about 15, 18 years ago, a group, group out in Chicago began to pursue something that is called a Cultural, Cultural Psychology. And they went to great lengths to try to distinguish it from cross-cultural, from anthropological, from, ah, ethnopsychology. And they argued that to understand the meaning of behavior for people whose life circumstances are different, for people who experience life differently, one has to understand the lived experience, the lived experience, borrowing a term from, ah, Michael Jackson, lived experience of the person who is being studied and, ah, Dick Schweder, and a fellow named Herdt, ah, Stigler, I'm sorry, they have a, ah, collection of essays that is called, ah, Cultural Psychology. These chaps are arguing that the standard notions in Psychology may not be adequate to understand the lived experience of another, particular if the other comes from a culture, comes from as, a society of set of life experiences that are different from the life experiences that had then formed the hegemonic position. And that's simply, a fantasy way of saying that a Psychology that, ah, is, ah, ah, primarily informed by the experiences of persons who trace their, ah, ancestry to northern Europe may not speak intelligently or adequately to the experiences of a folk who trace their ancestry to s, s, ah, Southeastern Asia or to, ah, to West Africa. They are challenging, head-on, the notion that what we are looking for in Psychology is a universal, ah, manifestations of the human behavior. They are much more concerned with the idiosyncratic. But they argued that in order to understand the idiosyncratic, you've got to go back to the origins of Psychology, when very early on, and I'm sorry my memory isn't good enough to, ah, recall offhand, ah, the two or three people who, ah, advanced these notions. But very early on, Psychology was very much concerned with something we call "intentionality." What, what is intended by the behavior? In the essay that, ah, Brenda and I worked on, ah, there's a line there which we suggest that the, ah, judicial as, aspects of our society have made much more progress in this, ah, front than, ah, we, psychologists, have. There are not many, ah, juries and even less judges that are not concerned when they are considering the, ah, ah, the anti-social behavior of a person who appears before them. Ah, ah, but we can, intent has been built in the law, either by accidentally kill you, it's not murder, either by intentionally kill you, it is murder. Now, these cultural psychologists are arguing that that early concern with intentionality, which has been neglected in Psychology, is critical to the understanding of people when they are talking about people who experience lives, their lives, in different ways. What is the intent, and what is one of the best sources for understanding that intent? Incidentally, we, psychologists backed away from it because it's so messy and so difficult to, to, to understand. The cultural psychologists argue that cultures themselves, cultures themselves express intent, because behaviors, the traditional behaviors, the ways in which we organize things, the ways in which we think about things, the, ah, technologies that we develop, all of which are parts of culture. Don't just happen, they happen for a particular purpose, they are engaged in for a particular purpose. And to understand my intent, then one needs to examine these things that I do. One of, one of the people who wrote what I think is one of the most brilliant of the essays in that collection on, ah, a Cultural Psychology, ah, Kenneth Gergen, introduces the language "relational adjudication." I asked him, ah, to, to, digress for a couple of minutes to tell you how he gets there. He begins the assumption that Psychology may have been, ah, disproportionately the psyche that is (inaudible ) that he (inaudible ) what is in my head is not only. 

00:26:57
[sil.] 

00:26:57
EDMUND GORDON  that has reality (inaudible ) notion of this, this, this out. (inaudible ) this is (inaudible ). He ends up arguing that the implication of that for those of us who was (inaudible ) about what's in my head and go to the real thing, which is what's outside of my head, but reflected in my head. And the. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:40
EDMUND GORDON  things out there. Now, I have not, as much as I have read and, ah, talked to, ah, ah, uhm, Gergen about it, I have not been able to figure out how one translates that formulation into a methodology for the study of behavior. Ah, that, probably, is a task for, fo, fo, for you, for your generation. But if you don't know Gergen's work, ah, you ought to look at it. He is a chap who, ah, shook up the field, oh, 40 years ago with an article that he wrote, "Psychology As History," "Psychology As History." And in that piece, he was simply suggesting that Psychology studies things after they have happened. And what it is we are trying to do from that history is to make inferences about, you know, and predictions about what, what's going to happen. And even then, 40 years ago, Ken is arguing that maybe we, psychologists, needed to get with it and get with the action, you know, try, try to find ways of examining the stuff that's going on. When you put that notion together with, ah, the notions of a chap like, ah, ah, S, Stigler, who is in the Rogerian and Lewinea, Lewinean, ah, tradition in existentialist. We are saying our, the focus of our attention is out there, where the action is, and these, ah, relationships and relations between things out there, and the unique meanings that those things have, those relationships have for the people who are experiencing that. And that's what the, the culturals, the new cultural psychologists are about. Actually, they are more critical of what we do here at, ah, TC(ph) with our cross-cultural work than I think is, ah, justified, and I think is justified. I think there's a place for comparative studies. In fact, one of the ab, ab, ablest people in our field, Michael Cole, ah, Mike studied(ph) at the University of California in San Diego. Mike's laboratory is called "A Laboratory for the Comparative Study of Cognitive Development." And what he is doing, incidentally, Mike has written a very interesting book on Cultural Psychology that takes a slightly different perspective from, ah, the, ah, Stigler, ah, Shweder, ah, Herdt, ah, approach to it. But, ah, I'm referring to Mike because he's one of the most respected people in Psychology, working on our side of the problem. That is, he's trying to understand the varieties be, of behaviors that are manifest in human beings. But he doesn't feel that, ah, we have to go as far as the, of a cul, cultural psychologist go in dismissing what the rest of the field has done. And, incidentally, if you, what a full picture, the range of criticism. You've got to look at the work of the so-called "critical psychologists." There's a chap of it, ah, Ontario, Edmund Sullivan, that has a very interesting little book that he calls "A Critical Psychology." And they're even more critical of the traditions of Psychology. My own position is that just as in almost all areas of knowledge production of, ah, of efforts at understanding, ah, the phenomena, phenomena of the world, one looks for multiple lenses through which to view the world, rather than taking an either/or approach that I've gotta be a cultural psychologist, I've gotta be a cross- cultural psychologist, I've gotta be a experimentalist. Ah, I think all of these are ways of knowing. I even argue in one of my articles that we, behavioral scientists, have been not only insensitive to the biological sciences as ways of knowing and understanding human behavior, but we have been most neglectful of the Humanities. If we really want to understand human behavior and its meaning, its meanings, plural, for, ah, different people, I think we need to go into the Humanities and see the ways in which, ah, ah, novelists have depicted the human experience from many, many, many perspectives. But I don't want to, ah, offer the Humanities as a substitute for the science of Psychology, nor do I want to offer any one of these approaches to the science of Psychology as a, a, the, the best way to do it. I think a better way to approach it is to say, "What is the kind of question that I need to answer?" And when I know what the question is, and can categorize the question, I then turn to the methodology of the subdiscipline that is most useful in solving that. And if the task is to understand the behavior of people who experience the world differently, I'm arguing that it may be that these, these emerging notions in Cultural Psychology may be more useful than some of the more traditional ones. Now, in my talk, I tried to be resp, ah, ah, in the preparation of it, I tried to be responsive to the themes of, ah, our conference this year. And they have to do with empowerment, with behavior change. And the title of, ah, our talk, I think, is "Cultural Psychology and the Fostering of Agentic Behavior." So, let me say a little bit about agentic behavior, then I'm gonna sit down and, ah, do what I should have done to begin with and let you, ah, take the lead, and let me respond to it since I've spent about half an hour simply talking at you, which is what I have intended not to do. The, the term, ah, "agentic behavior" was, probably, first used by, ah, Albert, ah, Bandura. And ba, basically, what he is talking about is human agency, human beings as agents. It has a slightly different connotation, though, for me, agents in the service of self and others. I have this, ah, ah, personal definition for politicalization that I talk about. If we think about socialization as the process by which, ah, we learn how to, you know, make it in society, how, how they follow the rules of a, of a group, I think of politicalization as a process by which we learn how to work together with other people to achieve our own ends, the ends of other people, without exploiting anybody. Now, agentic behavior, or human agency, is behavior in the service of self and others. Let me use, ah, Bandura's language. He says that human agency, good morning. (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
 Good morning. 

00:36:15
EDMUND GORDON  That human agency has four dimensions: One is intentionality, that is, the behavior has a purpose, it has intent, and the power to initiate actions for a given purpose, the power to initiate action for (inaudible ) for a given purpose. The second characteristic, agentic behavior, now, is forethought, thinking about the action in anticipation of future events, thinking about it, coming up with a gameplan. The third is self-reactiveness, monitoring one's pattern of behavior and the cognitive, environmental conditions under which it occurs, self-reactiveness, something like, uhm, metacognition in the, ah, tradition of Cognitive Psychology, and self-reflectiveness, the metacognitive ability to reflect upon one's thoughts and actions to determine their appropriateness, their utility, always for a particular purpose, so that, ah, Bandura is placing a heavy emphasis now on purpose, on intent, on action, in pursuit and the service of that purpose. Now, please remember my earlier remarks today where I, ah, referred to DuBois' position that if one knows and understands, one is responsible, and so with a moral responsibility to act. Bandura is coming along now in his "agentic behavior" and indicating that that stage of development that the, the mastery of that, that characteristic carries with it, intent, purpose, the capacity to act in that. But at the end of this, ah, group of characteristics, he adds this responsibility to reflect on it, to think about it, to think about the way in which it serves one's this purpose. Now, in putting together the, ah, the talk, "Cultural Psychology and the Fostering of Agentic Behavior," we are simply taking the position that in order to better enable agentic behavior, one needs to know and understand the behavior of, of the actor. And we are suggesting that, that behavior of the actor, understanding the behavior of the actor, becomes far more complicated when the actors don't come from the same life experience, don't perceive the world in the same way, or have different intentions behind their behaviors. And a Psychology that does not enable the examination of that context, those perspectives, those intents, is less adequate, as a Psychology if the purpose now is to inform and enable the agentic behavior, the human agency of the person. Uhm, let me rest for a minute, and let, ah, one or more of you raise a question or a comment or a challenge or if I said something you didn't hear or don't understand, I'll be glad to entertain that. And promptly at 9:50 we have to be out of here. Oh yes, please, are you bothered by this thing? (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
 What was the second of the four dimensions that you mentioned? 

00:40:15
EDMUND GORDON  The second of the four, ah, forethought. 

00:40:25
 Forethought. 

00:40:25
EDMUND GORDON Ah, no anticipation, thinking about the action in anticipation of future events. Uhm, Miss, ah, Naheer, can you give you the reference for, for, for Bandura. Yes, please? 

00:40:40
 Ah, I just, ah, I just wanna thank you for, ah, sharing your knowledge to us and, uhm, and these events give the world a view and, ah, I'm glad that you did that. (laughs) So, I'm so happy. 

00:40:55
EDMUND GORDON Thank you. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
 Because of that, I want you to know (coughs) based on self reflections, it seems a lot like Paulo Freire's I hear in Praxis and in Paulo Freire, he talks about practice, Praxis as a means of liberating the oppressed. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
EDMUND GORDON Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
 And what are social occasions of these actions or self reflection, and Bandura's, in Bandura's belief of agentic behavior in terms of social action and as it relates to Paulo Freire's idea of Praxis. 

00:41:30
EDMUND GORDON I, I think you have, ah, made a, an appropriate connection. I'm trying to remember whether in anything I've read by Freire he, ah, quotes Bandura, and I'm not sure that he does. And I suspect Bandura doesn't, ah, quote, ah, Freire. But one of the interesting things about the, ah, knowledge is the ways in which ideas surface in different context, but speak to similar issues that I suspect these, ah, these perspectives share a lot of, of, of kinship. Ah, Bandura is a professor of psychology, distinguished professor, I know he holds a chair at Stanford. I would never think of him as particularly, ah, revolutionary, whereas when I think and read Freire's work, ah, he's obviously on that side. I suspect, ah, Bandura comes to his position from a reasonably conservative critique of the traditions in psychology, and many of his values are probably, ah, mainline, ah, hegemonic ones. But that doesn't keep the notions he ends up with, ah, from being appropriate here. Ah, one of the people whose work I sometimes quote in this connection is Heidegger. And Heidegger, no matter how you try to clean it up, I think he was a Nazi, but he still had some ideas that, ah, help us to, ah, understand the world better and, ah, and, and, and move along. Now, I certainly would not want to associate, ah, Bandura with being that far on the light of that evil. He's a very, ah, decent, and, and, and good person. But I suspect he was not approaching the world from the same concern for radical change that Freire was but the notions, ah, certainly complement each other. Anybody else who wanna add something to this? 

00:44:05
 I'm not sure if I'm saying it directly but you spoke to your own view of politicalization? 

00:44:10
EDMUND GORDON Oh, yes. 

00:44:10
 Yes, and, uhm, it seems to me that that's something that is not directly spoken to quite often, and, uhm, that it tends to be considerably very, uhm, ambitious thing, and, and, risky... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
EDMUND GORDON Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
  perspective to present. And I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more on, ah, uhm, to, uhm, just educate us about (inaudible ). 

00:44:39
EDMUND GORDON Ah, yeah, I will, and I'll, ah, begin by not taking credit for the idea, but attributing it to my oldest son who's one of my advisers. (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:44:50
EDMUND GORDON Ah, Ted's a professor of anthropology down at the University of, ah, Texas. He would argue that most human behavior in groups is, ah, political, and that we, ah, ah, fail to recognize it. And those of us who do recognize it, you know, come, ah, back away from it for, ah, for the wrong reasons. But that all ca, all social, all of the social behavior of, ah, human beings is directed at managing the power and resource relationships, ah, that exist between us. And that it may be that the people who most benefit from that have intentionally tried to direct our attention away from it, ah, so as to, uhm, keep those of us who would be controlled from using it to, ah, break out of that control. Ah, I am thinking now of a talk that the boys gave in which he was challenging his own statement at the beginning of the 20th century, one that he became quite famous for se, for asserting. He said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line. In the late 50's, just before he left this country to go to, ah, Ghana, he said that he was rethinking that when he thought that the real problem, ah, certainly the emerging problem for the 21st century would be the problem of those, of the divide between those who have and those who have not. And that it, maybe that those who have were deliberately getting us preoccupied with differences between race and gender and, and class while they ran away with the bank. To come back to the issue of politicalization, I think that we mistakenly avoid the importance of political activity and it is not, ah, it is not necessarily, ah, an evil for us. It is very often manifest in, ah, evil, and destructive, and controlling, and exploitative terms, but it need not be in my conception of it, just as my conception of agenic, agentic behavior. It is the expression of human activity in the service of self and others. And, of course, being a humanist and socialist, I argue my own special qualification that using ones activity in the service of self and others must always be tempered by the commandment to do no harm to others (inaudible ) in our own interest as agentic behavior. (inaudible ) when you put down the folk in the next room.

EDMUND GORDON  Well, now, if you leave it to me, I'm gonna run. We're headed out to a wedding, but I'll stay a few more minutes if you want to. Yeah? 

00:48:40
 Ah, was the (inaudible ). 

00:48:46
EDMUND GORDON  Yes? 

00:48:50
 And when you talk about, talk about resources and the distribution of resources, I'm just wondering, uhm, a lot of people say Dubois moved towards this issue of power dynamics. Now, I'm wondering, Dr. King also, moved towards this issue of power dynamics when, and later on in his life, now I'm wondering if you could just speak to this issue, and of it being more so, power dynamics rather than other forces. 

00:49:20
EDMUND GORDON Uhm, I, ah, am trying rather to try to think of, ah, some way to amplify your remarks. Ah, and I, but I was tempted to suggest that you make the speech there. Because I think you probably have thought about power dynamics, ah, explicitly, ah, more than I have. Ah, yes there is an underlying concern there. I'm not sure that off the top of my head, I can say something more useful about that than, than you might, if you wanted to elaborate there, there. But you're certainly right that this is the thing that, ah, King ended up with. He didn't begin his career, ah, talking about power. He certainly ended his career talking about power. And his challenge to the hegemonic power many of us think, ah, contributed to his assassination. Well, thanks for, ah, sharing the hour with me. Ah, our, our department chair came in toward the end of my talk, Professor Madonna Constantine right here. Did you want to say something to... (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE No. (crosstalk) 

00:50:40
EDMUND GORDON ...say goodbye. 

00:50:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:50:43
EDMUND GORDON Okay. Well, thank you, again.
