00:00:35
 Martha, how did you decide that it would be a good idea to do this interview? 

00:00:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:00:50
 I've been seeing them a year... we rotate with each parent every week. 

00:00:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:00:55
 Are they separated? 

00:00:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:00:55
 Yes. 

00:00:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:00:55
 What's dad's name? 

00:00:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:01:25
 Eloiso. In the last few months it's become more complicated because Angie wants to die. She's tired of all the court hassle. 

00:01:25
 [non-English narration] 

00:01:25
 Are they involved in a custody battle? 

00:01:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:01:30
 The parents have to go to court, but the kids don't. 

00:01:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:01:35
 Are the parents still involved in the divorce process? 

00:01:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:02:45
 One week they're with him, the other with her. One month ago, Angie told me that she wanted to die. She saw a knife in the kitchen and decided not to do anything. Therefore we did a contract that she wouldn't hurt herself, and I talked with mom and dad too. She didn't talk about it again, but I noticed that she was going downhill and I had her see a doctor. The doctor did not recommend medications because she was too young. 

00:02:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:02:45
 A child psychiatrist? 

00:02:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:04:20
 A pediatrician who works well with kids. The doctor told the parents to improve Angie's diet. Too many sweets. The doctor wants her to return in two or three weeks. Also, the parents disagree. They both say, "the kids are treated right when they're with you". I wanted to do a session together and they just accuse each other. They both say, "you did this, that's why we're here." I decided to see each parent separately with the kids. This week it's her turn. If I had asked him to come in also, he would have. He says he would do anything for the kids. 

00:04:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:04:25
 Do you have an idea of what you want to do with the family today? 

00:04:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:05:10
 When the kids come with mom, the boy doesn't like to come. It's possible that we're on different levels and have different agendas. I feel I can't help them to make progress. I feel stuck and that we're not making progress, but I want to do so. 

00:05:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:05:20
 Celia, what would you like to get from this conversation? Have you talked about this interview together already? 

00:05:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:05:35
 Yes, a little. I feel like I'm doing my part and trying to do the best for the kids. 

00:05:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:05:55
 Before you tell me what's happening... Is there something that you'd like to get out of this? Something you'd like? 

00:05:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:06:05
 I've noticed changes since they've been coming. 

00:06:05
 [non-English narration] 

00:06:05
 What kind of changes? 

00:06:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:07:10
 They have some bad behaviors. They eat on the floor, while watching t.v. or they try to do homework watching t.v. She eats lots of sweets, which has gotten better. When they're with dad all they eat are Cheetos until he gets home. That's all they eat until he gets home from work. 

00:07:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:07:15
 What would you like to get from this meeting that may have been going through your mind? 

00:07:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:07:40
 I'd like them not to feel depressed. At school one of her friends asked me if her father and I were fighting. I said "Yes". She told me that her dad came to school today... 

00:07:40
 [non-English narration] 

00:07:40
 How long have you been separated? 

00:07:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:07:45
 Three years. 

00:07:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:07:45
 Legally separated? 

00:07:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:07:45
 No! 

00:07:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:07:50
 That's why you're in the court process? 

00:07:50
 [non-English narration] 

00:07:50
 Yes. 

00:07:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:07:55
 Have conflicts increased or decreased during the court process? 

00:07:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:00
 Look, I try to avoid conflicts and focus on the kids. He does his thing and I'm not interested. My only interest is the children, that they are taken care of, attended to. I'm not interested if he sees other people, just concerned about the kids and that he spends time with them. He didn't do well before. He needs to make an effort in taking care of them. They went to school poorly dressed. On my days off I went to the school and I could see that the kids are not taken care of. School can't watch all the kids. 

00:09:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:30
 Angie? Is there something you want to talk about? I asked Martha, I asked your mama...is there anything you want to say? I could tell that you didn't like what Martha said because you covered your ears as if you didn't want to hear. Would you like to talk about something? 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:09:55
 Answer him. What do you want to talk about? Well, do you want to talk with Martha? 

00:09:55
 Does he look like me? Not the same. 

00:10:00
 No, no, no. No. 

00:10:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:10:15
 If Angie had some questions, what would she talk about? What do you think she would want to talk about? 

00:10:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:10:30
 How to get her parents back together. How she would be able to help to get her parents together. 

00:10:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:10:35
 In other words, how to get them together again. 

00:10:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:10:40
 And to make a plan in order to do so. 

00:10:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:11:30
 How does it seem to you Angie, this idea that Martha has...this idea that in the back of your mind you'd like to get your parents back together? I imagine that you wonder who I am to ask all these questions. Let's suppose that I'm someone you can confide in and trust when you talk about your parents getting together...do you mean that you want all four of you living together again or that they get along with each other? 

00:11:30
 Both. 

00:11:30
 Both. 

00:11:30
  Both? 

00:11:35
 Both? 

00:11:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:11:50
 You miss them being together? Is this a conversation you've had with Angie? 

00:11:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:00
 Yes, with both children. Sometimes I just do therapy with them, talking about a plan and what they'll do. 

00:12:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:05
 Angie what do you think Mike would like to talk about? 

00:12:05
  Toys. He always talks about his toys. 

00:12:10
 What kind of toys? 

00:12:15
 Power Ranger. 

00:12:15
 Power Ranger. 

00:12:15
  Huh? 

00:12:20
 Huh? 

00:12:20
 Power Ranger. 

00:12:20
 Power Ranger. 

00:12:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:12:30
 In other words, if toys were here, he wouldn't be sleeping? 

00:12:30
 Maybe he would make a plan too. 

00:12:35
 Maybe he would make a plan too. 

00:12:35
 [non-English narration] 

00:12:40
 What type of plan? 

00:12:40
 I don't know. It's like let's tell my mom and tell my dad to go to birthday cake and stuff like that. We could get them back together right there. Let's tell my mom and dad to go to the birthday cake and go to play, there are some stuff and they will get married, that Mike right, that's it. 

00:13:25
 So you two guys make plan sometimes about them getting back together? 

00:13:35
 Never tried them. Never, never, never. 

00:13:40
 Can I say something? Would it be okay if we talk Spanish so that your mom can understand? 

00:13:45
  Okay. 

00:13:50
 It's easier, because she isn't understanding anything you're saying right now. 

00:13:50
 Yes, she is, correct mommy? 

00:13:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:13:55
 A little. 

00:13:55
 I told you. 

00:14:00
 But, it's much easier if you speak Spanish and you know that. 

00:14:00
 I'll if you give me a candy. 

00:14:05
 You know that I'm not going to give you any candy. 

00:14:10
 But you're supposed to give me. 

00:14:10
 Spanish, Spanish, Spanish. You know how to speak it really well. 

00:14:10
  No. 

00:14:15
 Yes. 

00:14:15
 I don't know how to speak Spanish. 

00:14:20
 You can ask me and I'll help you. 

00:14:20
 Is that? How do you say dolls in Spanish? 

00:14:25
  Dolls or dogs? 

00:14:30
 Dogs. 

00:14:30
  Perros. Okay. 

00:14:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:14:55
 This idea that your daughter has that you will be getting back together, has it always been there? 

00:14:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:15:00
 This is the second time I've heard it. 

00:15:00
 I've told it the hundredth time. 

00:15:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:15:05
 You haven't heard it one hundred times, just two. 

00:15:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:20
 One Tuesday night after she finished her homework, she talked with me, she wanted to know why I can't be friends with her dad. If we were going to separate, why not try. I asked her, "You'd like that?" She said yes. I can't make him be friends. I've tried but he doesn't. Any little thing he yells and gets upset. I don't want to interfere in his life. I just want things right with me and you kids. I told her I can talk with dad but relationship--it won't happen. She didn't like that. She wants us to try again, but we're not able to. 

00:16:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:25
 What conversation would wake Mike? 

00:16:25
 [non-English narration] 

00:16:30
 About Power Rangers...Mike! 

00:16:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:16:40
 You don't have to wake him. Is this conversation hard for him? 

00:16:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:00
 He doesn't like to talk much. Michael is more reserved. He needs to be pressured to get him to talk. 

00:17:00
 [non-English narration] 

00:17:00
 Pressured? 

00:17:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:05
 Yes, he has a lot of distress that prevents him from talking. 

00:17:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:15
 This is the first time...that he's come here asleep...in the year that they've been coming here...the first time. 

00:17:15
 He was scared. He said the last time that he was afraid. 

00:17:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:25
 He was afraid? 

00:17:25
 Yeah, I think. 

00:17:25
 [non-English narration] 

00:17:30
 What do you think he's scared about? 

00:17:30
 I don't know. Maybe he just got scared. He said aah. 

00:17:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:17:45
 What do you think will happen in the future Angie, with your mom and dad? 

00:17:45
 Back to marriage. Back to marriage. 

00:17:50
 Back to marriage. 

00:17:50
 [non-English narration] 

00:17:50
 Speak in Spanish, Angie. 

00:17:50
  No. 

00:17:55
 [non-English narration] 

00:17:55
 They'll be married again... 

00:17:55
 Yeah. 

00:17:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:18:00
 Is that your fantasy or do you believe that will really happen? 

00:18:00
 Bah, bah. 

00:18:05
 It sounds like you don't want to talk about. 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:18:50
 I've told her many times before... Many times she's asked me the same thing. I've told her, the only thing they can do is get along with mom and dad and it is not your responsibility to keep your parents together. But I think that she blames herself that they're not together. 

00:18:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:18:55
 Where do you think that she got the idea that it's her fault? ...separated or together? 

00:18:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:19:40
 They suffered a lot. When mom left, or when dad said she left, the children suffered tremendously. They were without food and without lots of other things. The situation was very unstable with dad, he didn't treat them badly, but it was unstable. The kids fought a lot with each other and dad would yell at them. At that time Angie felt that when her mom left, it was their fault. 

00:19:40
 Martha, I was joking. 

00:19:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:19:50
 What do you think she could have done? 

00:19:50
 We were fighting a lot. 

00:19:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:20:00
 I've explained it and made her understand that she didn't do anything... 

00:20:00
 [non-English narration] 

00:20:05
 But she thinks she's done something. 

00:20:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:21:45
 Yes, she thinks she's done something. We've progressed a lot with the relationships. They now both have both parents, but Angie still talks like this. Not like before. She asks, "when are my parents going to be together?" In the beginning, Angie didn't want to go with mom, only with her dad. And Michael didn't want to go with his mom, only with his dad. Now I see a great change. Angie gets along with mom. She hugs her and is not afraid to be in the room alone with her. And Michael gets along with dad. They worked on how dad can talk with Michael when Michael cries or is sad. But even so, the kids want to bring them back, even though we've been over it again and again. 

00:21:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:21:55
 So Angie still thinks that she had something to do with the separation...She would rewind it and get them back together. 

00:21:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:22:10
 But we still don't know what it is, just something she did. I think that affects her a lot but what it is we don't know. 

00:22:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:25:05
 Can I say Something? From what Martha just said, I can understand why Angie feels guilty. Because when I left my home, I left with the kids and we stayed with my parents. When we stopped the paperwork for the courts we made an agreement. The kids were living with me at that time. We agreed that the days he worked they would stayed with me and the days he had off they would go with him. We did that for a while but I started noticing changes with the kids. When their dad had to go to meetings at the school, he didn't go. I told him that if he wasn't responsible, I wouldn't him have the kids anymore. I had my mom take the kids to school with him, but he didn't like it. Then he made up this story that I hit him. That day he was wearing a leather jacket and a plain shirt. I was working that night, the kids were going to school near my parents house. One Friday, he took the kids from school and didn't bring them back. That day he went to the police and told them that I scratched him in the back while wearing the jacket and shirt. I had gotten my nails done that week and I would've damaged them if I had hurt him. That's why she feels guilty because she knows that they lied to the police. Their dad told them it was a joke to play on mom to get her to come home. I decided to separate because I tried so many times to live a relaxed life, but it was as if he's never there and it hadn't worked. I couldn't have peace with him plus he was never there for the kids. Then I decided to live a different life dedicated to my kids and he didn't like that. 

00:25:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:25:25
 Here is where we have some disagreements because each side had different stories. That is one of the problems I have too. It is hard to understand them with different stories. 

00:25:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:26:00
 He lied a lot to Martha. When we had this court order, he lied. He got a restraint order so I couldn't see the kids and he moved them to a different school. I couldn't get close to my kids because of the order. Their dad told them I didn't love them because I don't go get them. He wanted me to get arrested so that I wouldn't have the chance to see my children. That's why I don't understand... 

00:26:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:26:15
 How...it's not clear to me. Why does Angie feel guilty? What did she do specifically? 

00:26:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:26:45
 She is thinking that when they went to the police, my daughter translated for her dad and told the police all these lies...that I had abandoned her...She feels guilty. 

00:26:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:26:55
 This is where we are stuck not able to progress. We have different stories. 

00:26:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:27:40
 When I went to see my kids after that, Angie didn't want to see me. She was afraid because of the lies she told. Their dad threatened her, "Your mom will hit you!" So he portrayed me as the bad one in the picture. I had never hit them, but he would tell them these things to scare them. So I told them that the way to help us was by telling the truth. 

00:27:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:27:50
 Angie, is it hard for you to listen to what your mom and dad had to say? 

00:27:50
 Yeah. 

00:27:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:28:20
 Look at me. Do you feel divided over these stories? Do you think that what you said about your mom is the reason why they are separated today...or is there something else you think you did to cause their separation? 

00:28:20
 No, it was the fight with me and my brother. 

00:28:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:28:25
 The fight between you and your brother? 

00:28:25
  Nothing. 

00:28:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:28:55
 Nothing? When a kid says "nothing", it means that there is something else there...Ok, so the fights between you and your brother are the reason why your parents are separated? If you hadn't fought so much with your brother, then your parents wouldn't have separated? 

00:28:55
  No. 

00:29:00
 [non-English narration] 

00:29:05
 Yes or no? I don't have it clear... 

00:29:05
 Angie, you need to speak up so they can hear you. But he wants to know why you think it's your fault. 

00:29:15
  I don't know. Well, I don't know. 

00:29:20
 You've told me sometimes what do you think it was a while ago that you thought something it was something that you did, do you remember what it was, exactly that you did? 

00:29:30
  No, I always change. 

00:29:35
 You always change. What was the last time before you changed your mind right now? What was the last time, what was the last thing you said to me? 

00:29:40
 I can't remember. 

00:29:45
 You can't remember. 

00:29:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:30:00
 Is there...I'm going to change something here...What do you think has been good about your mom and dad's separation? 

00:30:00
 Nothing. 

00:30:00
 Nothing. 

00:30:00
  Yeah, no more fighting. 

00:30:05
 [non-English narration] 

00:30:10
 There are no more fights between them. 

00:30:10
 But still, to be together. 

00:30:15
 [non-English narration] 

00:30:20
 What happened when they fought? 

00:30:20
 Scream. 

00:30:20
  [non-English narration] 

00:30:25
 It's as if things are more relaxed now? 

00:30:25
 Well, it is a little bit. But I still think that it would be much better if my mom and dad lived together. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:45
 [non-English narration] 

00:30:50
 Let's do the switch. 

00:30:50
 Okay. 

00:30:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:32:15
 Angie got my attention. She had a lot of attention on the magazine. She was still aware of what her mom was saying. I'd still like to know about the magazine. She had a lot of attention on the magazine. She feels the tension. She feels the need to do something and maybe by trying to hurt herself she will get her parents' attention. This might increase her tension. That's all for now. 

00:32:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:33:40
 I'm Karena and what I noticed is what Celia said to her daughter. It seems like there hasn't been a continual dialogue with regards to what's going on with her parents. Each parent has a perspective and reality. As you mentioned, this must be strange for the kids. My experience has been that the kids have the fantasy of getting their parents together. Even though it's repetitive, the parents need to continue letting their kids know about the reality. 

00:33:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:33:45
 A continual process? 

00:33:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:34:10
 Yes. The parents get tired of talking about it. Both parents and kids feel at fault. They say, "If we don't talk about it, it will go away." 

00:34:10
 [non-English narration] 

00:34:10
 Like it doesn't exist. 

00:34:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:34:35
 Yes...exactly. It seems like this continual conversation isn't there. It seems repetitive to us, but not to the kids. I don't know when or how that happens...day to day. 

00:34:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:35:15
 I noticed the kids. Even though she was looking at a magazine, I saw her give her brother a kiss. It looks like they are very united. Even though she's doing the talking, it seems like he knows that's going on. Perhaps he thinks that the separation, the divorce of his parents is his fault. They talk about how they're going to get their parents together. They have the same fantasy. 

00:35:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:36:05
 I can see how Martha feels stuck. I'd probably feel the same way. One thing I've learned from my cases is not how to solve problems. Maybe let the kids know that we aren't going to work on solving problems...but how to express how their experience is... 

00:36:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:39:10
 We didn't talk much about extended family. I wonder what the grandparents' idea are and if they have the same fantasy, to get the parents together. The other thing that on one side, we've all mentioned it, that this is a fantasy. I think that maybe Angie realizes that this is a fantasy and it won't lively come to pass. We haven't really heard what she thinks will really happen. There are two co-existing conversations. She can have the fantasy, we all have some fantasies, but there's a voice that tells us it won't happen...but we still hold on to it. I heard from someone that the siblings are barometers of what's going on in the family. Mikey, instead of fantasies, simply leaves the world. Angie keeps the hope that things will change. The other thing we didn't talk about is what the parents think a good relationship would be like for the benefit of the kids. That's hard when a divorce happens. Sometimes we see negatives and the past, not so much the future. 

00:39:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:40:35
 I feel sad putting myself in her place, being a young Latina woman, having trouble with the language. It's hard enough, isn't it? She's young, a woman, a Latina, in another country. It's important that her kids feel secure. I'm wondering what support she gets? She's found an angel in Martha, who understands her, speaks her language. But where else can she get support? Maybe her parents, or some kind of community service or group of women who have had similar experience would help her. 

00:40:35
  Okay. 

00:40:40
END OF REFLECTIONS 

00:40:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:42:05
 They're right! I have a lot of family support, morally and economically. I've tried not to get depressed. I've been going to church with the kids to show them a better way of living. I've been trying to talk with my mom and with my daughter. With the boy too, but it's mostly playing with him. We do homework and I go to classes in order to help them with school. Before, my going to school created fights with my husband. 

00:42:05
 [non-English narration] 

00:42:05
 Why is that? 

00:42:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:42:10
 He just didn't like school. 

00:42:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:42:15
 Because he didn't speak English? 

00:42:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:42:30
 He just never liked it. My goal was to go to High School and learn English... 

00:42:30
 [non-English narration] 

00:42:30
 You went back to school? 

00:42:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:42:50
 I finished Mexican, but the classes didn't count here. So I wanted to finish school so things could be better...a better job... 

00:42:50
 [non-English narration] 

00:42:50
 More opportunities! 

00:42:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:43:45
 I've been there for fifteen years, but because of the language I haven't stayed. I want to progress and give my kids a good example about school. They didn't like school. I want them to go to school. I encourage them so they don't have to work so hard. It's important for them to do school. If I go to school, they'll go to school. I tell them: if you're going to work at a job without school, you'll get minimum wage and you'll have to work very hard. 

00:43:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:43:50
 So this is the legacy you want to leave with your daughter? 

00:43:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:43:55
 Yes, not a big career, but... 

00:43:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:44:00
 Why not? 

00:44:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:46:50
 Maybe they don't like to study what they'd like to be. I would liked to be a teacher. She can be a doctor or a dentist. She says she wants to be a veterinarian. I said you can do it, but for this you'll have to study. She has to prepare...not working in some factory. I want better things for them. I worked so hard for a house and lost it, lost practically everything. But we have to move forward. It doesn't matter because we are starting a new life. We don't have to think about what we've lost, but think about what we're going to get. I've told them to ask for help, and I'll explain it to them if I understand. It's not important what we've lost: We have good relationships, thanks to Martha, she's helped me a lot. She's my support, along with my brothers and sisters, in very difficult times. Sometimes it's hard to bring out painful things, but we've got to keep going. I don't like them to lie. Among ourselves, we need to be able to be truthful and open. When they talk to Martha, they need to tell the truth, to talk about their suffering. They suffer because they want to. The children know that their father never worried about them... 

00:46:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:47:10
 Celia, about this idea that your children really want to suffer...Do you really believe that? 

00:47:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:47:35
 I think that if they could only tell the truth to Martha, they could get past the suffering. 

00:47:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:47:45
 Do you have the feeling, Celia, that the truth is complicated for a child? 

00:47:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:47:50
 Yes, it is. 

00:47:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:48:10
 Your relationship has its own stories about things that happened. Whatâs trueâ¦whatâs not trueâ¦it's difficult to figure out. That happened between you. 

00:48:10
  [non-English narration] 

00:49:25
 I think that she wants me to understand that the children are suffering with their dad. They arenât telling me that. On Monday, I told her that if the children are suffering with their dad and Iâm not picking up on this, Iâm not doing a good job. I should know. Either Iâm ignorant or not doing good therapy. Either Iâm ignorant or not doing good therapy. I talked with the kids and asked them, âWhat does your mom think is going on with you and your dad?â Angie, what did you tell me? 

00:49:25
 Yes, you do. 

00:49:25
  What did you tell me? 

00:49:30
 [non-English narration] 

00:49:30
 Do you want her to tell me? 

00:49:30
  Please Martha I beg you. 

00:49:35
 Okay, you're begging me. 

00:49:35
 I beg you. 

00:49:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:52:30
 Celia told me that the kids sleep in the car while he works. That concerned me. I hadnât heard that before. I found out from the kids that this was true. It's not a big deal. Sometimes weâre with him when he has to work. We play a lot in the car. Okay, I told mom that I would talk to him Wednesday and see whatâs happening. I wanted to clarify things so I made an appointment with dad. I asked if it was true that they slept in the car while he worked. I need to know the truth about what is happening when the kids are with you. Is it true they sleep in the car while you work? He said, âNo, thatâs not true.â Around the 30 or 31 of December, his employer asked him to come in early. He told me it was about six in the morning, before dawn, when it was still dark and they didnât want to stay home. They waited in the car for no more than 30 minutes to an hour. He said, âThatâs it.â He said that five years ago he had to leave them sleeping in the car while he worked. He couldnât find someone to watch them. How I understand it is that she wants me to see that the children are mistreated, but I donât see it. This is the sessionâs focus. 

00:52:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:52:45
 Martha, it is almost like you are an investigator. 

00:52:45
  [non-English narration] 

00:53:40
 All this stuff with court affects dad and he brings it up. He says that I donât defend him. I tell him that Iâm not here to defend him and that this only makes the children suffer. Since then he only talks about the children. They never say they have a problem with dad. But when I talk with Celia, it's always about how the kids are being mistreated and suffer. 

00:53:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:54:00
 Iâm not going to side with anyone, but is there a way that this could have a resolution? 

00:54:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:54:40
 What I donât want is for them to bring my children to me in body bags. Their dad is making excuses for not wanting to accept the truth. Five years ago, he could have left them with someone, but wanted to make me mad by taking them to work and leaving them in the car. 

00:54:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:54:55
 Do you feel that a resolution could be reached if the truth were known? If we got Eloizo here would he say the same thing? If we had the truth could we solve the problem? 

00:54:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:55:00
 If they told the truth, we could solve it. 

00:55:00
 [non-English narration] 

00:55:00
 But only a certain truthâ¦ 

00:55:00
  [non-English narration] 

00:55:05
 Yes. 

00:55:05
 [non-English narration] 

00:55:05
 If I spoke with Eloiso, he would also want the âtruthâ to come out. 

00:55:05
  [non-English narration] 

00:55:30
 There is one person who can verify that he took the children to work and I was told that they were very scared and it wasnât for a short amount of time. My daughter told me later when I told her to tell the truth. 

00:55:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:55:40
 Celia, how do you imagine that Angie hears all of this? 

00:55:40
  [non-English narration] 

00:56:25
 Right now I know that she feels sad. She doesnât want to hurt her father. These are adult problems. She is a child and she is not responsible for any of it. I know she is hiding the truth and she should tell Martha or someone what is really happening. 

00:56:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:56:55
 Angie, the way your Mom is saying things, does it make it difficult to stay here with the family? Let me say it another way. What your Mom says, you probably hear it from your Dad too. Celia, this is what makes Angie want to disappear. I donât know how to say thisâ¦ 

00:56:55
  You want to say in English? 

00:57:00
 Have you heard the same kind of story from your dad on your dad sides too? And that you hear this from your Mom, you hear this from your dad and it's sort of like, there is something there that makes you really feel that? Yeah, and thatâs sort of something that would led you to make it to disappear and you would like to disappear from the map? Yeah. 

00:57:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:58:25
 There is this thing that has not been resolved. It is like something boiling inside of you. There is something I donât have the word for it in English or Spanish. It is something unresolved. It is like it is boiling inside of you and probably the same with Dad. It's like an automatic pilot and it starts to come out. This is probably where the stories are the same. The reaction is automatic. 

00:58:25
  [non-English narration] 

00:58:30
 They have only come together onceâ¦ 

00:58:30
  [non-English narration] 

00:58:35
 No, no. When he comes with the children and when she comes with them. 

00:58:35
  [non-English narration] 

00:58:55
 Theyâre different. When heâs here with the children he doesnât talk about Celia. 

00:58:55
  [non-English narration] 

00:59:15
 In our earlier conversation I was wondering, what would have to happen for the conversation to change the conversation that Martha has with the children. 

00:59:15
 [non-English narration] 

00:59:15
 What do you mean? 

00:59:15
  [non-English narration] 

00:59:30
 What would have to change so that you didnât talk about these things and could talk about other things? 

00:59:30
  [non-English narration] 

01:00:10
 We could talk about other things, but they always complain to me about their papa. I havenât tried to confront him about this. They have only come together once, Iâve been trying to explain to them that he has another relationship. It's not possible for us to get together again. 

01:00:10
  [non-English narration] 

01:00:45
 This is another problem. She always says that the person taking care of the kids is in a relationship with dad. But this person is only in the house when the children are there. This is something she wants me to see, that there is a relationship. I donât see it. Iâm not there. I donât see it. I donât know. 

01:00:45
  [non-English narration] 

01:00:55
 Exactly. She is not the person who takes care of the kids. Precisely, because the kids fought with this women, he had to take them to work. 

01:00:55
  [non-English narration] 

01:01:00
 I talked with him about thatâ¦ 

01:01:00
  [non-English narration] 

01:01:20
 He lies. He wonât tell you. I want you to see the truth. Another therapist caught him in his lies and he didnât want to go to her anymore. 

01:01:20
  [non-English narration] 

01:01:55
 Celia, this part of the conversation is hard for the children to hear. You need to talk about it, but not with them here. It's important that you have this conversation with Martha or with another person, but not with the children. It's too difficult for the children to hear. 

01:01:55
 [non-English narration] 

01:01:55
 Maybe it is difficult for them. 

01:01:55
  [non-English narration] 

01:02:10
 And not necessary. So much so that one sleeps and the other one wants to disappear off the earth to get away from it all. 

01:02:10
  [non-English narration] 

01:02:20
 I can understand my daughter. This is why I agreed to this meeting. 

01:02:20
  [non-English narration] 

01:02:40
 I want to help them to distinguish which conversations are appropriate for the kids. Some of the conversations make the children want to disappear. 

01:02:40
  [non-English narration] 

01:02:45
 Thatâs why Iâm here. 

01:02:45
  [non-English narration] 

01:03:05
 When it comes to discussing ârealityâ the children should not have to take sides in the conflict about âtruthâ. 

01:03:05
  [non-English narration] 

01:03:10
 My problem is that the kids keep pressuring me about their dad. 

01:03:10
 [non-English narration] 

01:03:15
 This is something between you and him. 

01:03:15
 [non-English narration] 

01:03:15
 I know that they have nothing to do with this butâ¦ 

01:03:15
  [non-English narration] 

01:03:35
 Right! They have nothing to do with this conversation! Letâs find them another space for this light. 

01:03:35
 [non-English narration] 

01:03:35
 But the parents never see each other. 

01:03:35
  [non-English narration] 

01:04:10
 Yeah, but it shouldnât be with the kids. You need to decide what Angie should and shouldnât hear. It's too difficult for her. 

01:04:10
 [non-English narration] 

01:04:10
 It is too hard for her. Angie, would you agree with me? Yeah? 

01:04:15
 She gone asleep. 

01:04:20
 Angie. 

01:04:20
 Would you agree with me? I want to say this in English because this is what I was telling your Mom that there is some conversations that you wouldnât want to hear. Am I right? Yeah. 

01:04:35
  [non-English narration] 

01:04:40
 So what would she like us to talk about? 

01:04:40
  [non-English narration] 

01:05:35
 What you should and shouldnât talk about with kids is a long discussion. You need to find an adult in your family to have this conversation maybe Martha and a third person could help you find a solution because this is too toxic for the kids. I think that you are able to see this and you want the best for your kids. You want them to be health, get a good education and be honest, to love you, for both parents. 

01:05:35
  [non-English narration] 

01:05:40
 I know they love both of usâ¦ 

01:05:40
  [non-English narration] 

01:06:15
 I know it is difficult. That is clear to me you think others donât believe you and they believe Eloisoâs lies this is a private conversation that shouldnât involve the kids. 

01:06:15
  [non-English narration] 

01:06:50
 Maybe you donât believe me because Eloiso was never truthful with Martha maybe that's why Martha doesnât understand me either. We havenât talked with Martha that much and she only knows his version. 

01:06:50
  [non-English narration] 

01:07:15
 This is exactly what the kids shouldnât hear. It's as if you told them about your intimate life with your husband, this kind of conversation is very difficult for children to hear. 

01:07:15
  [non-English narration] 

01:07:35
 Precisely, but Martha repeats his lies. For example she said I left the kids I would never abandon my kids. 

01:07:35
  [non-English narration] 

01:08:35
 Celia, I do listen to you. I asked Eloiso about the kids sleeping in the car. But I also want to help the children. I havenât been able to help the kids because I donât know where to go with them. If I didnât listen to you, I wouldnât have asked Eloiso to come in. My job is to learn the truth to help the kids. 

01:08:35
  [non-English narration] 

01:08:45
 Your job is to help the kids. Youâve seen the children are afraid, but not of what is said. 

01:08:45
  [non-English narration] 

01:08:50
 They have this fantasy that the two of you can get back togetherâ¦ 

01:08:50
  [non-English narration] 

01:09:10
 I donât think thatâs their fear because I know my children I raised them by myself. My parents have always helped me. They are with them all of the time. What you were saying about that woman, I know she is his partnerâ¦ 

01:09:10
  [non-English narration] 

01:09:30
 Celia, Celia, this is the conversation that we donât want the children to hear. We should limit it to adults. 

01:09:30
  [non-English narration] 

01:10:30
 I know, but it has to include a few things that I have to tell them it has been two years that we have been fighting for custody. Thatâs why he doesnât know how to be a father. I have always taken care of them their doctors, their school, their meals, their bath. Iâve always done it alone. He never had time for us. We were always a family, the three of us. Now he puts a restraining order against me and I canât see the kids and he tells then that I donât love them. Thatâs what the kids tell me. 

01:10:30
  [non-English narration] 

01:12:10
 Celia, weâre running out of time. Iâll have to talk with Martha to give her some ideas I hope this conversation has been helpful somehow. I would have liked for it to have taken different turn. We could have talked about how the needs of Celia and Eloiso are different from the needs of the children. What the children need now is different from the need to find the âtruth.â The âtruthâ about that women is irrelevant to the truth that the children need. They need to clarify other things. I think the therapy should go in the direction of clarifying other things. We have to finish now. 

01:12:10
  This session which Celia, Angie, Mike and the therapist Martha was a very difficult one. A very difficult conversation that in some way led to some clarification about the kind of way are the therapeutic system was tough and although I never feel that there was a final solution to what was making the whole system to be as tough, I thought that we were able to clarify what were the kinds of conversations that needed to happen in the future and what was the context for those conversations. Iâll say a little bit towards the end of this segment, a little bit more about this after. So how do I carry out this consultation? I was invited to consult with a therapist and her family and I have the opportunity to having a reflecting team behind a one way mirror, which is heavier situation in the usual context, but not unusual in the sense of having lot of professionals involving in interview assumes that I often and doing in a collaborative way. So what were my, my main assumptions, one of the main assumptions was to make as much as possible transparent and to be very careful in respecting the therapist work and not to comment some are who are saving the family or the therapeutic system for assuming. This is the way of supporting the family, supporting the therapist. And I, in a way was very respectful of the therapeutic work that this therapist was doing. And in fact one of the things I do tell the reflecting team in the back before the session is to actually take a stance that is more of a God mother than a therapist who really think carefully and candidly about the family and the therapist. One of the things I do is to try to clarify what is that each participant wanted to accomplish in the session, in the interview. And rather than assuming that there is an implicit agenda just because Iâm there. So what do we do in this interview, we first, I first interview the family and the therapist first I interview the therapist a little bit about what is the kind of work that theyâve been doing and then we had, I ask a few questions to Mom and the kids, any one of them, and then we have a reflecting team in which I basically have a dialogue with the people who I, going to one way mirror and then again we have the therapist and the family to the brief and talk about what they heard. In the session, the therapist here some of her dilemmas there was, that she is been facing as she has been talking with in this case Angie. The older child of Celia, who has been saying that she wants to harm herself that she doesnât want to be around and thinks want to live anymore in a way suggesting some form of suicide attempt in the future, which led the therapist to be very worry. In this session Angie and her mother Celia and the other child Mike talk with me, but basically it is a mother and daughter who actually talk to me. Mike stays basically most of the session sleep and tries basically does not respond to any questions and there is several explanations for this, one of them is he is late, he has been school all day and also it seems that this situation got him to be afraid and it seems like something that he didnât want to do. And the therapist tell me later that actually he Mike is very talk, talks a lot when he comes to therapy with her. This is a situation in which has been a fairly tumultuous separation and the therapy has contact with both parents, but both parents do not talk to each other much. There is a lot of accusations of pet parenting on both sides and at the moment there is sort of restraining order for her in terms of seeing the kids, that was a restraining or that actually her former husband setup for her. In the session, like I see Mike, Mike makes himself absent, asleep in part due to the cold and as then I explain because this is what the mother says, but also I think that he consciously seems unable to stand being there. I attempt to engage him in a few times, and but in the end the way I know about him is asking his sister through secret questions about Mike thoughts, and youâll see that. One of the first dilemmas is, how to engage with your family in which the child feels somewhat comfortable speaking in English and the parent feels more comfortable speaking Spanish in this case or the language, language of the native country. In this case the therapist ask Angie to actually talk in Spanish so that her Mom could understand. She had to tell her a few times that Angie actually does speak in Spanish and at times come back and speaking English, you know this is something that I play out throughout the session and when she is feeling not very happy about talking I asked her to for her to speak in English if something that already has been spoken in Spanish. One of the things that the therapist tells me is that the children have a lot of fantasies about having the couple pack together and is this something that the therapist has aboard or have talk about in a psycho educational way telling them, they are basically it is not something that they would have a lot I mean they could influence a lot and so this is one piece of the work that has been done before and I do not enter too much because I feel like this is something that the therapist was very clear about. The mother throughout the session accuses the father of being neglectful and of being abusive towards them. And she feels like that the kids have been line up out there and that they feel guilty because theyâve been asked to lie by their father about what is happening. And this makes her very upset. Besides the issues after, with the couple I think that there was underlying issues that were mentioned, but have not been work out too much and it has to do with some that all this stresses have been magnified by their economic situation and work situation and the long hours he had to put into working her work et cetera and this is something and also the lack of housing on a particular moments, even though there is, some of the social context may explain some of this stresses it seems that they are unable to place that their behavior in that context and what is interesting is that both deny best behavior, but both accuse each other of doing so. And it is in that context that I, that I suggest that it must me very hard for a child to be around when these are the kinds of things that have been talk about. And she I mean at some point in therapy the child suggested that she might be responsible they might be responsible for the divorce of the parents to be the divorce situations because the girl used to fight a lot with her brother. During this conversation I feel the need to shift into a large arithmetic content of the session and I explicitly ask many times if I can switch to another issue. And so that I ask permission to them to do that. In the reflecting team, I thought that was very important to have reflecting team because the reflecting team allow each member of the reflecting team to join with different members of the family so the family be feel heard and since this is a mother who feels like a professionals living and listen to her I thought that the reflecting team was very helpful in terms of how you felt more at ease to normalize her experience and to sort of feel understood. It also, the reflecting team in some way helps me as a consultant who think about different idea that could become a hypothesis or a way of intervening the future for instance one of the things I do think about doing reflecting team is how is that the fantasy this kids can have could so like be kept alive, but that, it is clearly fantasy and that it could be like any other fantasy. So I tried to explore a little bit the idea of being able to keep the fantasy not to fight against it, but to accept it and to add other kinds of contents to their ideas or the way they think about the parents. In the interview later on, after the reflecting team I thought that the mother felt pretty much understood and that the reflecting team reaffirms some of her own, that if we intrude to some of her own experience. And for instance after the reflecting team talks about her hopes and how she is been supported by the family and also by the therapist. And in this context, she talks about how the chylification and that she did have all the opportunities in part because she married and she talks about the hopes for the allocation of her daughter and which is very interesting because this is the first time she talks about the future of the daughter, but she does in a way that is somehow sort of like putting some limitations to the convocation that her daughter will have and I challenged her and I say why is that she cannot do some of those things. Soon after though she comes back to the issue of you know whatâs the truth from her perspective and how that no one's really her perspective and they listen to her husband. I talk a lot about in this session about how triangulating the children can be very damaging to them and also slowly, but surely on a eruptive basis, we talk about how is that there are some conversations that you would reserve for the adults for the parents, for the professionals to have and then there are some discussions that children should not be pride to and this is so like happens through the whole through segment and every time mother comes back to talk about in a way that I felt that be not helpful to the kid I pointed out and this is so much so that actually the Angie sort of hide behind a pillow and if you, and I ask her and engage her she is listening, but she's somewhat seem to be not to be wanted to be there as the same ways as her brother is like not there. And again although in this segment it become evident that the difficult that have this therapist when doing the therapy a compulsion in highly contagious situations you know the temptation is to become some sort of like a forensic investigator Iâm not a curious conversational partner I guess so clinician in this case. And this is dangerous because there are other people who probably fulfilling the role. In synthesis I thought that this was an example of attempting to have a difficult I mean, attempting to have a collaborative conversation within the context of a very difficult and contagious situation and I think that the session raises some of the challenges I saw some of opportunities that accessed when I balance a collaborative engagement with a fairly consistent message of what are some of the conversations that children might known as we need to be in.
