SUE JOHNSON Hi everybody. 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:00:20
SUE JOHNSON Thank you for coming. I'm going to talk to you about something called EFT which my very clever son calls "extremely funny therapy." And I only have an hour so I'm, I'm going to try and just give you sort of a, a taste of it. Some of you already know it, know it well, some of you not at all, but I think, uhm-- before I do that I want to say that how, uhm, wonderful I feel about this conference and about being able to do this with my dear friends, ah, John and Julie, and how I feel that this is-- this sort of conferences are part of a new era in our field, that we are-- that there is, uhm, a relationship revolution going on and that this kind of conference is part of that. And, uhm, I hope at end of this conference you guys will feel that you are part of that relationship revolution. It seems to me that in the future if we keep doing what the Gottmans have done, what we are trying to, and, you know, if we join with wonderful clinicians like all of you, what we are doing is creating a society where people no longer talk about love as a mystery and will no longer talk about relationships with cynicism and despair, that what we can do is change the culture of love relationships in North America. And, uhm, that's all I think we can do. So-- and the way we do that of course is we keep out art of humanist, our, our precious, ah, belief and connection, our values as therapists but we also embrace science. We embrace science. So, uhm, I'm going to start by, uhm, showing you, uhm, a piece of tango. Those of you who know me know that I have a number of passions in my life, but one of the things that I do, uhm, in order to survive in all doing this is, I does Argentine tango. And I don't dance the sort of thing you see on the tele that's all about women throwing their legs over their head and with big slits on their skirts, and that's all silliness, okay? Real, real ordinary people don't does tango like that. But it's very interesting because if John and Julie were talking about attunement, and if you think about that in the end, uhm, we're trying to do something very difficult-- we're trying to take two scared off balanced people in couple therapy and help them have the experience of attuning into each other. And that's quite interesting cuz it seems to me it's gotta be an experience. You can't just instructor tell them to do it, they've got to actually experience. And what I wanna suggest you is, one of the reasons I like tango is because tango is a Ph.D. in attunement. Uhm, because what some people don't realize is real tango, the essence of it is it's improvised. And what that means is that you have no idea what your partner is gonna ask you to do or how your partners gonna turn up and move in front of you in any moment in time. And what you have to be able to do is to dance with this person and doesn't sound like relationships. It's to be able to tune-- leave your head out if, feel-- pick up the emotional message, because in relationships the emotion is the music of the dance. Pick up the emotional message and tune in and find a way to balance each other in the dance. Help each other keep your balance physiologically and emotionally and learn how to move together in a way that you both create one. If-- it seems to me if you have moments like that then, uhm, you can deal with anything in your married life. So I'm going to show you (inaudible ) who are my teachers at Ottawa and I'm gonna show you 2 minutes of tango.

SUE JOHNSON Hmm. 

00:06:10

00:06:15
SUE JOHNSON What you are looking out there is what physicists called resonance. Resonance is when two random particles that seem completely unattached to each other suddenly seem to turn towards each other, tune into each other, read each other cues and intentions with amazing accuracy and begin to move in synchrony and coordinate their movements, so that they can each move in some sort of music that brings them together. So this is a beautiful image and it fits with what we talk about in EFT because, uhm, basically, the last 30 years of research in EFT suggest that there are mely-- many elements to a relationship, and as a couple therapist, you can change them all. What we have to do is change the key organizing elements of that relationship. And it seems to me that you have to work with emotion then, because emotion really is what organizes these social interactions especially close intimate social interactions. So what we do in EFT in, in just in a big global is we try to create these moments of synchrony, these moments when people are emotionally connected with each other. And the ultimate is that in stage in two of EFT, we try to create what we call a "hold me tight" conversation. Because our research says that if people can have these kinds of moments, these "hold me tight" conversation, they don't have to have them all the time. They don't have to even have-- they don't have to be able to produce them every day. But if people know how to get there and have these kinds of moments, then our research says they are not distressed at the end of the therapy and they are doing just fine in two and three follow-up, uhm, you know, after therapy. In fact, some of our research says that actually they continue to improve. And why would they do that? Because this is intoxicating. What you just saw on the screen was intoxicating. And we all know as human beings those moments. You know, it's the reason we go to the movies in some ways. We all know those moments when suddenly we feel connected with the person on the screen or connected with the person in front of us, and emotionally, it's like we are just completely with that person and there is something totally joyful about that. And the longing for connection sometimes we can say our task is difficult in couple therapy. What I want us to also recognize is, yeah, it is, but we can plug into the powerful in-built motivating system in our species. We can plug into people's longing for that kind of synchrony, that most moments of deep connection, and knowing that you are with someone and you matter to them. We can plug into that longing. If you plug into that longing, people will basically do the emotionally equivalent of climb Everest, because that is so powerful. And there's a flip side to that which sometimes gets in our way, sometimes not which is-- and the fear of not having that, that connection ever is also what drives people into your office. So, uhm, so let's talk a little bit about love, cuz that I think why people come to you. They don't just come to you because they want the fights to stop, they do want the fights to stop. They don't just come to you because they can't stand, uhm, to hear that their partner is disappointed in them, they do want that to stop. And they don't know what to do with their pet. They don't know what to do with their pain. They come to you because they want to find a way to be loved and to be in a loving relationship. Love is the most used word in the English language. Uhm, and it's rated on things like Google as the most important question asked now. People say, "Is love possible? What is love? And how can I have a love relationship?" Until very recently, as species all through history, in poetry, in art, in philosophy, in psychology, in therapy, we have dismissed love as a mysterious mixture of sex and sentiment that nobody can define. That's Marilyn Yalom writing in a wonderful book called "The History of the Wife." Okay, that what she says. And if this is true, if this is really true, ah, and we are all thinking of ourselves as couple and family therapists, I think we should just go home. Because if you can't understand it what you don't understand, you cannot and you cannot keep. And in that case, a science of love is impossible. I think what has changed in the last 15 years is, uhm, it is, it is clear that we can have a science love. And the Gottmans have been a big part of that. 

00:11:30

00:11:35
SUE JOHNSON So what I wanna suggest to you is that, love is actually very understandable. It is an exquisitely logical survival system. It's our foremost-- the most basic need from the cradle to the grave. It is our only defense against what John Bowlby, who started the whole science of bonding and attachment, and which for so long was just applied to mothers and infants, and now only in the last 15 years has really systematically been applied to adult love relationships, it's our only defense against what he called emotional starvation. He said, emotional isolation is inherently traumatizing for human beings. Another way of saying it is to say you have a mammalian brain. You have known since the moment you were born that you need other people and you have known that it is dangerous to not be able to call for others and have them not come. If they do not come, you are vulnerable and in danger. You know that in the very core of your being. So what we are starting to understand in science-- this new science of bonding is that all need a haven of safe haven secure base relationships and that these relationships give us a haven of safety and strength. They give us a place where we can be dependent. And this is a dependent sea that makes us stronger, not a dependency that turns us to wimp or makes us immature. What I wanna suggest you is, this is really true. Then, couples therapy is not just a place where you can heal relationships because you understand the dance in front of you and you understand what love is all about. And you understand the moment when it goes wrong and you under-- the moments that you need to do of attunement to make it right. Basically, what this is saying is, it means that couples therapy becomes a place where you cannot only heal relationships but create relationships that heal. And don't just heal, the couple, while they're in your room, in this relationship context, they heal the individuals in the relationship and they heal the families. And I'm gonna suggest you-- because I just wrote a crazy book called Love Sense which is coming out in January-- what I'm trying to say this is-- and we need this to heal our society as well. Because at this point, most of us do not live in tribes or communities or villages and the-- with beautiful webs of social support. For most of us, our tribe, our community and our village is our partner. In which case, we have never counted on romantic love. No such of civilization has ever asked so much from our romantic love relationships. So, uhm, it feels good to be able to say, uhm, "I think we're getting to the place where we, as mental health professionals, can start to be able to tell people, 'Yes, you can have good love relationships, yes we know how to do it, we not-- we know what goes wrong.'" That's pretty revolutionary it seems to me. So, uhm, the other thing that I wanna say to you is about love. Acevedo and Aron did a study a few years ago where they looked at infatuated new lovers and longtime lovers and they showed them pictures of their partners and they put them in a brain scanner ma-- machine. Brain scan studies are very sexy right now, okay? So, uhm, they put them in a, a brain scanner machine and what they found was-- they said, "Let's see if love, whatever that is, can last, can it really last?" And what they said was, "Hey, in a percentage of these older couples who'd been together longer, their brains reacted in exactly the same way. They lit up in exactly the same way in these new infatuated lovers. The only difference was that the older more long-term lovers went as obsessed with the other person. When I read those results, I thought, "Ah! We can do it without obsession." That's very interesting. But what's really interesting for us is, I thought it was the guts-- most gutsy ending to, uhm, a social psychological article I ever read. What they say at the end of the article is, "If this is true, then couple and family therapists better get on their horse." Because it means that we can see love on a brain scan, it means it can last. It means it's got a real reality to it, in which case they better start learning how to create it with people and help people create it. And I love that challenge partly because what I wanna say to them. I'm gonna say that just-- then, one day when I met them is, "Hey, did it already." Now that's a little arrogant, okay, because we do have to learn a whole bunch of things but still I just wanna go out and say, "Hey, we did it already, okay?" So, so EFT looks within how partners construct their emotional experience of relatedness and between how couples engage each other. EFT is like a conversation between Carl Rogers who basically said you have to look at the whole person not just the tiny little symptoms they come in with and you have to believe that people want to grow and don't want to be in pain, and you have to go and then create safety so that they can explore that pain with you, right? And, uhm, ra-- it's a conversation between Carl Rogers, Salvador Minuchin who said you have to look at patterns between people and see how they get stuck in patterns. And those patterns, in themselves, becomes toxic. You have help them move into new patterns. And John Bowlby who would come along in this conversation and say, "By the way, you're not just dealing with any old relationships, you're dealing with attachment relationships which are coded in the mammalian brain in terms of life and death. So you're dealing with relationships that have got a huge pack of huge existential wallop. So EFT is kind of like a conversation between those people. But there's one piece missing here. If you ask me where EFT came from, it came from me. Being, being a Rogerian, me and my colleague has got Grinberg-- being Rogerians and start-- me started to family therapy, à la Minuchin in a treatment center. But it really it came from me, sitting down with couple and realizing I have no idea what to do with these people in this room. I have no idea. In fact, I think one of my deepest most profound early interventions was to say, "Shut up." It doesn't work, okay? If you ever, if you ever attempted, it doesn't work. It just takes them off, okay? So, I couldn't find anything in the library, I couldn't find anything in the library so what I started doing was taping my couples and watching them. And I used to watch them six, seven, or eight times. So, really, EFT didn't just come from Roger and Minuchin and Bowlby, EFT came from couples teaching me what's going wrong, where they get start, what I could do to help? And I wanna tell you that has never stopped. We tape all our couples in ther-- in our research sessions. We do all kinds of supervision and we-- I watch my own tapes. I still watch tapes of people and couples still teach us. They still te-- if you want to understand the stunts, you have to watch, you let your couples teach you. And one of the essential things about doing EFT is to stay curious and let your couples teach you about their world and where they are stuck. All right. So, what we do is we look within at how people create, formulate, and regulate their emotional experience that then turns into the messages they send their partner. We are wired to pick up the emotional expressions on a person's face in 100 milliseconds. And in 300 milliseconds, the mirror neurons in our brains have given us the exact same feeling inside our bodies that we see on that person's face. So emotion is an incredible signaling system. It's the music of the dance. So what we do is we help. We look within our people create their emotional experience that then result in the signals they send to their partner and then we look at how their partner response and engages with that, how it-- either it gives their partners all kinds of choices or narrows those choices of responses down, and then how the dance between the partners then turns in a sort of reciprocal feedback loop and creates the inner exper-- emotional experience of people. So we have to go within and between in order to what? In order to expands the emotional responses, to expand numb out, "I don't feel anything" to "I feel so sad. If I start to talk about it, I will be reduced to tears and she will think I'm a wimp." To expand numb out into sadness, to expand reactive anger into desperation saying, "I am angry at him. I am, but it's not really about the chores, it's the fact that I'm alone in this relationship. I'm alone and I can't bear it." So we expand emotional responses. Please note, this is disciplined. EFT is not about ventilation and catharsis. Catharsis comes from the Greek word for diarrhea. So we expand the emotional responses. We change how people put their emotions together so that they can send new signals to their partner, signals that help their partner move closer to them rather than staying away or building a wall and defending themselves. We expand emotional responses in order to create new kinds of interactions. If you want to change your dance, the easiest way is to change the music. If you don't change the emotional music, lots of luck, teaching people trying to teach people to tango when there's waltz music going on. It's too hard. All right. You need this power of emotion on your side. You knew how to-- you need to know how to take people into the emotional channel, hold them there and use that power to create a new step in the dance. So, we create new kinds of interactions. What new kinds of interactions? Specifically, we try to create new interactions that are about accessibility and responsiveness. Interactions that are emotionally open, where people can help each other, keep their emotional balance, tune into each other and get this moment of synchrony, where we can foster secure bonding between partners. From an EFT point of view, this is, this is the problem and you guys can recognize this cuz it's a beautiful piece of, uhm, Four Horsemen of John. "Do you love me?" Unfortunately, she asked for love with a hammer in her hand and unfortunately your mammalian brain, uhm, takes negative affect and puts it first. Because after all, it's dangerous and survival is the first thing, right? It's-- you need to focus on that first, so it's more important than any positive affect. "So, do you love me?" "Of course, I do. How many times have I told you?" Flat affect. "Well, it doesn't feel like it." And she turns away and says, "Well, maybe you have a problem then." "I can't help it if you don't feel loved." What he just told her is, "Your pain is of no importance to me." That will escalate everything all to hell. And it does. "Right. So it's my problem is it? Nothing to do with you, right, nothing to do with 10 feet thick walls. You're an emotional cripple. You've never felt a real emotion in your life." "I refuse to talk to you when you get like this. So irrational. There is no point." She's-- you know, he says, "I refuse. I will not come out on the dance floor. I refuse." If he really stays there, there is no relationship. So, she's gonna-- at the end, "This is right. This is what always happens. You put up your wall. You go icy. Till I get tired and give up. Then, after a while, when you want sex you decide I'm quite so bad after all." "There is no point of talking to you. This is just a shooting gallery. You are so aggressive." The point I want to make-- this is a nice rigid blame withdraw cycle of what John Gottman would call absorbing states of negative emotion. Okay? The point I want to make here is the reason is so toxic. It's because there is no safety here at all, there is only escalating danger and isolation. But you could look at what's happening here in a thousand different ways. You can look at it that one person has got a personality disorder. You could look at it that somebody's depressed. You could look at it from a thou-- they-- they've got no skills. You could look at it thousands different ways. I'm gonna suggest you as an EFT therapist, you see this a separation protest. This is about attachment and the lack of connection. This is about disconnection that they can't repair. This is about the fact she say, "Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? I will push. I will scream. I will make you respond to me. I will get you to respond to me otherwise there is no relationship." And he says, "My god, I count on you. You, you have this huge impact on me and I don't know what's going on. And you're dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous and I will withdraw." And the more he goes back in self-protection, the more alone she is, the more she'll come out and attack him. And what John Bowlby is, from this point of view, let's remember this is an entirely reasonable response on both of their parts. They just have no idea of the dance they're playing. They don't even know it's about attachment. They don't even understand the impact they're having on each other. But from our point of view, this about relationship distressed. So I'm gonna go into the piece. Emphatic responsiveness is the essence of EFT. Emphatic responsiveness of the therapist creates the safety and emotional balance that the couple cannot give each other. The goal is to guide partners into this responsiveness with each other. This is our value statement. My sweet husband says every organization has to have a, a mission statement, a value statement, so here's ours. Resolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged an d sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and the wrong. Some time in your life you will have been all of these. This is a "we are all turkeys in the same turkey soup-type therapy" not a "we are magical experts creating magical moments and we know what to do and our clients don't-type therapy. That model was very, very, very popular at the beginning of couple and family therapy. So the most basic EFT intervention is emphatic reflection. Emphatic reflection creates safety. I put a platform onto people. I save them all the time. "I hear you. I understand you. You make sense. Your struggle makes sense. The-- your struggle is the struggle I go through, that we all go through. It's okay. We know a way through. We know how to help you with that." Emphatic re-- emphatic reflection creates safety. It focuses the season and slows processing down. The main issue with emotion it seems to me is it's fast. And it's good cuz it's supposed to be fast to save your life. Only unfortunately, it's fast and that means that we have a lot of trouble processing it and regulating it and dealing with it particularly when we get triggered by our past. So we pros-- we focus on slow processing. And a good reflection better organizes and distills experience. It creates coherence. Roger said, "A good reflection is a not a repetition, it's a revelation." So if you watch an EFT therapist, they slow everything down, they slow the emotional music down, they tune into it, and they slow people down and they emphatically reflect, so that people can start to dance with more deliberateness and intention. The five basic muse of EFT are we have steps and stages, okay, across therapy, we first de-escalate negative cycle that people get caught in. We help them see the dance they're caught in. We help them name their dance. We help them see the dance as the enemy and step-- help them step out of thi-- help each other step out of the dance then we help them to create a new dance of, ah, uhm, restructuring attachment. We help them create this new dance of positive emotions, positive connection, and we do consolidation. But that's across therapy. If you watch any EFT therapist in any session, it might be a little depending on where you are in the therapy. You will always see the EFT therapist doing these things. And I don't know why we called it the tango, but anyway probably somebody do with me. Okay. So you will always the EFT therapist continually with both partners reflecting present process. "What-- could we stop a minute please? What just happened right there? What happened right there? You said, 'I don't think you care anyway.' I don't, I don't tell you my sadness cuz you're not gonna care anyway. You're just gonna turn away.'" And as you said that, indeed you turn your chair away. Is that what happens at home? That's what happened right here, isn't it? What happened right here was we tune people into the present moment. We stay in the present. You're watching EFT therapist do that, or you're watching the EFT therapist go into not just the pattern in front of them but somebody's emo-- the emotion on somebody's face. As you talk about this, you say you feel fine about it but actually when I look at your face-- "Could you help me?" It seems that there's incredible sadness coming over your face right now. Could you help me with that?" Your mouth was turned down. You looked down at the floor. Could you-- and so you focus on the inner and between process. You reflected. You bring people into the present. And then you'll see the EFT therapist and explore a deeper emotion say, "And as-- do you-- and he-- and you turn away?" and he says, "yes, I do turn away. I hear that she's sad, I hear that she's sad but yes, I turn away." And the therapist will go and say, "Could you help me? What happens to you when you see the sadness on your wife's face?" You say-- he says, "Well, I see it now but most of the time she's angry at me. She's just angry at me. And I'm just waiting for her to get angry with me." And the therapist follows that and says, "So even now she's sad right now, you can't respond because some part of you says it's not safe in the minute she'll be angry. Is that right? Am I getting it?" He says, "Yes, that's right." You say, "Ah, so what it's like for your wife to get angry with you?" And he says, "Uhm, ah, ah, well, I, ah, ah, I, I don't like it." And then I walked through that door. "You don't like it? Could you help me?" He says, "I don't wanna hear. I don't wanna hear. I can't hear anymore. I don't wanna hear it. I'm just a big disappointment. That's why I'm at this marriage. I'm the big disappointment and I can't bear it." So, so then I say, "So, then, of course, you turn away?" And then, what do we do? We help him talk about how it feels to be the big disappointment. And then we turn that new emotional experience into a new message for the partner and we set up an enactment. We say, "Could you tell her, 'You're right. I do move away from you. You're right. Even when you're sad, I can't respond because I'm so worried that in a minute you're gonna get enrage with me and it's too hard. It's too hard. I don't know what to do with it. It hurts. It's too hurt. I just wanna run.'" So you create a new interaction from the new emotional experience. And then what do you do, you process it. You say to her, "What's it like to hear that new message?" Sometimes people say, "I never knew that. I never knew that. I, I, I thought I didn't know that. I have the impact on him. I don't want him to feel that way. Some few people say, "Good. He hurts." And you turn and you said, 'Was it like to tell her? You says you're scary.'" And you say, 'And for you right now, you're hearing him and want him to come close and share with you but all that's in your heart right now is that you've hurt so over the years but right now you want him to hurt, too. Are you-- is that right?'" And she says, "Yes. I guess some part of me feels so angry. I want him to hurt." All right. And then the EFT therapist who went from there and say, "Good. Can you tell him?" "You know, some part of me wants you to hurt." And I say, "How do you feel when you say that?" He says-- she says, "Ah, it doesn't feel very good really. It really doesn't help me that he hurts." So you cre-- you process the enactment. And then, the EFT validates the new process and says, "Hey, guys, look what you just did! You've only been to see me. This is the second session. Look what you just did. You've been so unhappy for 28 years. You just came out and took a huge risk to share your sadness. You, you, uhm, you got caught in your negative pattern but you didn't stay there. You turned and you talked to her about 'I'm so frozen in my fear of your anger. I can't respond.'" And at first, it's hard for you to listen to but then you did listen to him. And now you're talking about how you're, you're softer emotions with each other. "Wow! That's amazing! Look what you just did." What they just did was take one attune step. One moment of attunement, one attune step towards what you saw in that tango dance, all right? So this is what we do all the time in EFT. We go through this. What are the strengths of EFT as a model? The strengths of EFT of the model are, that we believe that we're on target. That we go to the defining interactions and the defining emotional messages that defining moments of disconnection and connection that make relationships or break relationships. And that, we believe that we are the only couple therapy that is, although John and Julie are joi-- are joining us here and-- or also closer to this than many of my other colleagues, we certainly use the same language. The only couple therapy based on a clearly articulated and densely research theory of adult love. That is relative to neuroscience. And I can stand here and talk, ah, talk to you about oxytocin, the cuddle hormone, and mirror neurons, and I'm not gonna do that because we don't have time. It also fits with research on relationship distress-- John Gottman has been a huge contributor to that-- and satisfaction. What we understand, we can shape and repair. It is the gold standard that I suggest for research-- uhm, our research on couple therapy. Out-- we have 16 studies over 25 years outcome studies that shows significant positive results and we have good follow-ups. We have shown the impact, satisfaction, trust, intimacy, forgiveness, and the security of the bond. And we have nine process of change studies that suggest that indeed people change in EFT in set patterned ways and they are ways that are fit and are suggested by our theory. So we sugge-- it suggests that we know why people change and how they change? We have generalized ability, different populations showing anxiety and depression respond to EFT. We work with all kinds of couples with comorbidities. For example, we work with stroke patients who have aphasia. We do EFT with a, uhm, a language therapist in the room. We work with different kinds of clients. We have affected training resources and procedures. EFT outlines the steps of therapy, specific interventions. Uhm, at this point, we're pretty good at training therapists. And there are actually three, uhm, studies of, uhm, on studies of folks learning EFT saying things like, "You know, it really impacted my own relationships. It taught me lot about love relationships. It impacted my own relationships. It gave me more confidence, et cetera. We have breath of impact. EFT integrates a focus on attachment which includes the self and the system. It's collaborative and respectful. We have very few drop outs and it tries to create core changes in love relationships that foster personal growth and family growth, so there's the possibility. If you can create more secure attachment in people,, that opens the door to all mental and physical health for those individuals. Other applications, EFT is use with families, with couples thinking education and enhancement, we have the Hold Me Tight program that we do now, we work with post-- we have a program for post-deployment war vets. So-- and of course, this perspective can also generalize the im-- individual therapy. And my stuff is called-- usually called emotionally focused therapy because I brought up by the nuns who taught me grammar. And my dear colleagues who do individual therapy, they call it emotion-focused therapy cuz they were Americans and they weren't taught grammar. Just to tell you that, okay? To give you feel what EFT research is going, let me give you a feel for our last little study. We did a study where we did show that we could change attachment, not just satisfaction and intimacy and trust but attachment, the security of a bond. And we included an fMRI piece. And if-- let me tell you what we did. This is my dear colleague, Jim Coan at the University of Virginia. What we did was we took insecurely attached, married distressed women and their partners and we put them in therapy. But when they first came into therapy. Before EFT, right, we put them in fMRI machine. And we said, "When you're lying in this machine, there's be an X come out in front of your face occasionally and when it comes up, there's 20% chance you'll be shocked on your ankles. And be-- by the way the shock hurts. Okay, so-- and we leave them alone in the machine and when they see the X, their brain lights up like a Christmas tree. And if we asked them if the shock hurts, they said, "Yeah, it hurts." If we have a stranger hold their hand, reach into the machine or hold their hand, male stranger, when they see the X the brain lights up a little bit less and they say the shock hurts a little bit less. When the husband holds the hand before EFT and they see the X, their brain lights up like a Christmas tree and they say the shock really hurts. It's better for them, in terms of their physiological arousal, the sense of threat to hold the stranger's hand than to strange their hus-- hold their husband's hand. Of course, because their husband is a danger cue not a, a safety cue. Twenty sessions of EFT, twenty sessions of EFT and this is pre-therapy. You're seeing the brain lights up like a Christmas tree there. Twenty sessions of EFT, they come in and they lie on the machine. When they're alone in the machine, their brain lights up like a Christmas tree. The shock hurts. When they're hu-- uh, being-- their hands being held by stranger, it's a little bit better, little bit painful. When their husband holds their hand after EFT, these are average brains-- wherever that is-- when their, when their husband holds their hand at the end of EFT, nothing happens. The blue bits mean the person isn't dead. They're still alive, okay? Now this is really interesting. This is so interesting that I have Jim Coan calling me from the University of Virginia, 11 at night, yelling in the phone, okay? "Ah! Do you get what this mean?" I said, "No, I don't. Okay, just calm down." So, what was really interesting was he basically said, "Do you understand that the husband has now become a safety cue?" This is what John Bowlby talked about. The husband has become a safety cue. And so now, the husband has such an impact on the physiological arousal of this woman, that, you know, her amygdala doesn't even turn on. But not only that, neither does the prefrontal cortex. This is interesting. It's not that the husband is helping her control her fear more, it's that the contact with the husband actually neutralizes the sense of threat as it's being coded. Being loved makes the world safer. It doesn't just help you cope with threat, it means that there is less throat-- threat to cope with. We know this. This is why we live in communities. This is why the Keltics-- Kelts talked about living in the shelter of the other. We have to live in the shelter of others. This is our basic way of dealing with difficult emotions like the fact that we're all small and vulnerable. So this is not out yet. We are, uhm, hoping it's, it's in review and we are hoping it's gonna be out soon. But this is what EFT is going. So, what we are starting to look at is the impact of this emotional connection, this hold me tight conversations on the brain and on the way people process literally, uhm, the, the threats and dangers and deal with the threats and dangers that are inherent in being alive. So it's pretty interesting stuff, okay? So the focus of EFT is on the present moment. We stay in the present because emotion brings the past life anyway into the moment. And we use the past to validate people's blots. We say things like, "Of course, you shut down, Al. Of course, you do." In your family, shutting down saved your life. It was a brilliant thing to do. But right here, right now, it pushes Mary away cuz she can't see you and she can't find you. And then she goes into a panic. And when I say that, I mean that literally. When I talk to my clients about panic and pain, I'm not using metaphors. Jaak Panksepp says that in your mammalian brain, there is a pathway that is reserved for attachment panic which is suddenly feelings, scared and uncertain and finding yourself alone with nobody coming to you, feeling abandoned and rejected. And Nancy Eisenberg talks about the fact that we are highly social, that our brain doesn't really distinguished at some level between physical and social pain. So if you give people rejection cues in the lab, those cues are processed in the same place and in the same way by our brains as physical change. I'll give you another example. Jill Hooley from England talks about the fact that criticism by a loved one is that she says, "Criticism by a loved one is experienced as low-grade punches to the brain. It is a pure threat signal. It is a"-- and if you think about it that way, I think it really helps to understand the impact it has on people. We don't understand that. Criticism from our friend or criticism from other people is powerful enough, but criticism from the person I depend on most in the world, that's a dangerous signal. That's gonna send me into alarm. So we stay on the present. We stay on primary affect. We go past the surface affect which is usually flat, contained, dismissed, or over the top reactive anger. We go down into the softer emotions, down into the vulnerabilities, the feeling of sadness, the feeling of loss and grief, the feelings of shame, maybe I'm not lovable, there's something wrong with me, and especially fear. Fear about abandonment and fear about rejection. So we go and we work with those. We help people-- help each other with those things. We look at pivotal moments in the process across time. Moments that help the couple connect. Moments that push them apart. We look at patterns of interaction. The therapist is a process consultant. I know the dance. I know the emotional territory that people are in. I understand the responses that they're caught in. I understand how they impact in each other. I joined them in the dance as a process consultant. That also means I don't have to have the answers all the time. It's called emotion-focused. I would tell John and Julie when I first met them that years ago, I would come to conferences and I would stand up and I would talk-- start to say, "I'm going to talk about emotion" and directly plugging into and using emotion in therapy, and half of the people would leave the room. And then, I would say, "And by the way, I'm also going to talk about adult boding and attachment" and the other half of the people would leave. Because everybody knew that you was supposed to be independent. So, me and the three people that were left would have a little chat. Okay? We don't trust emotion. We come from a culture that says it's a dangerous stuff when you better keep under control. But I wanna say that in the last 15 years, we have understood it more and more and more. So, when we work with emotion, we're not working with some big dangerous monster that's gonna come out of a cave. We are working with a process that always begins with a cue, a rapid appraisal of the environment-- good, bad safe, dangerous, pleasure, pain, body arousal-- please notice all of this has happened before your prefrontal cortex that is having tea has even turned around. The prefrontal cortex is too slow to save your life. Okay, so body arousal meaning appraisal. "What did you say to me? Are you really-- you're like, you're like massively rejected me, aren't you?" And an action tendency. And this is what, what-- it's so important for couples therapist. It's the music of the dance. The emotion determines how you put your feet, whether you move back from your partner, whether you move forward, whether you move forward in a way that you're gonna embrace and help your partner keep your ba-- their balance, or whether you're gonna move forward in a way that pushes their partner of emotional balance. So we know that emotion is a source of vital information. If you don't get people into their emotion, they can't tell you what they need. Never mind negotiating. They can't tell you what they need. It's a, it's a vital element in meaning. It primes actual responses. It primes movement. And it organizes social interactions. We know the process in an emotion. We know what it does. We know what the emotions are. This is Ekman's work. Okay? Uhm, if you s-- I remember a book years ago that said there are 39 basic emotions. Now, if that was true, I would not be up here on this stage because you would all be in your-- you would hear one lecture by me and then you'd go into your sessions and you go, "Let me see. Is that 24 or 32? I don't know." Right? And there's a book just come out about destructive emotion which you think is a very silly title but never mind. Uhm, destructive emotion on page two, it says there are 1,836 destructive emotions. So, in that case, the EFT therapist could be very busy. But then on the last page of the book, they say, "Oh, ever so sorry. They're not actually emotions, they are actually states of mind. Well, that's naughty." okay, cuz they called, cuz they called then emotions. So we have six. Anger, which is all about asserting and defending themselves. Sadness, which is all about seeking support and withdrawing. Surprise and excitement, which is about attending and exploring. Shame, hiding. Shame is very toxic in relationships because it causes people to shut down and hide from the other person. And of course then, you can't heal shame when you're, you're not open to fe-- any positive feedback so you're stuck. Shame. Fear. Fear is about fleeing, freezing, giving out the goal and joy. As John Bowlby talked about anger of hope and the anger of despair, and maybe we can talk about that a bit later, but I am assuming that your clients do not come in and say to you, "I have entirely too much surprise, excitement and joy in this relationship." In which case, you aren't gonna be dealing with reactive anger and sometime primary anger which is about asserting themselves and saying you will not-- you must stop slamming me. I will not tolerate it. But mostly, you're gonna be dealing with reactive anger and you're gonna be dealing with sadness, shame and the fear of abandonment and rejection. So what I'm saying to you is, this is known territory. We know so much about emotion. We haven't trusted it. We've believed in the power of cognitive thought. We've seen emotion is something primitive and random and we believe that we are Homo sapiens. That means the reason is the most important. Well, as you get to know emotion, we start to understand how powerful it is then we-- and we know the territory then we can deliberately plug into it and work with it. And if we understand which is happening now, that we are not just Homo so-- sapiens, in fact maybe not even mostly Hemo-- Homo sapiens, we are Homo vinculum. We are the ones who bond. Our brain is a social brain. What is special to our species and the reason we are the dominant species on this planet is because we bonded into families, into communities, into tribes. We bonded. We created something called civilizations, right, and coordinated our actions and intentions together. So what I'm saying is, emotion too has changed. And as you understands emotion, you know to create and use it for change. I'm not gonna go over those, the, the, the pictures of emotion. EFT says rif-- rigid rif-- interactions reflect and create emotional states and absorbing emotional states reflect and create rigid interactions and you have a feedback loop that stuck. And that is why marital distress is so stable. Partners are not sick, developmentally delayed, enmeshed, colluded, symbiotic, fused, they are stuck in her bit of ways of dealing with emotions and engaging with others at key moments. Emotions and agent in target of change. Change involves new experience, a new relationship events and effective couple therapy has to address the security of the bond. It has to create mutual emotional accessibility and responsiveness. And this man told as how to do that. So, as I say, sometimes if you heard me speak before, it is God's little joke. She decided to make a joke. And her little joke of this century was, of the last hundred years was, "who is going to discover the secret of human love and bonding which everyone has decided ever since the beginning of century was a mystery." I don't know. Some wild scientists in California with, uhm, you know, hair like John Gottman and, uhm, and a beard and who has a ri-- does a white sports car and-- no. A small uptight, restrained, aristocratic English man. Now that's silly. Okay. I'm English so I can tell you that's a silly idea. Okay. But that's what he did, okay? And what he-- and this is a picture of a surgeon who operates in utero and he says this moment changed his life because he was a surgeon who operates on fetuses in utero. And then one day, in a middle of an operation, this little hand came out of the womb and grabbed his finger and would not let go. And that 'ah' you just did, that's wired in and that's your assis-- attachment system clicking in, okay? All right, so what he said is this strength in this little hand and it would not let go, and John Bowlby say of course, because that is the most basic instinct in man. The most basic instinct to man is not sex or aggression. The most basic instinct in man is this, to reach out for another human being and hold on. Just like the most basic question in couples is, are you there for me? And sometimes John and I disagree and we think about perpetual problems. What I always say to him there's only one perpetual problem actually in relationship and it's always about, are you there for me? Are you there for me? Can I count on you? Do I matter to you? So, this is another picture of a little girl born in Ottawa. And what I wanna say to you is my colleague Jim Coan who does the neuroscience with me says, "What you're gonna get is that this little girl was born expecting those hands to be there." This is the natural ecology of human beings. This is our ecological niche. This is what need to survive from the cradle to the grave. This is where we belong. And when we cannot get this, our system is wired and organized for this. And when we cannot get a sense of being able to rest in somebody else's hands then all kinds of things start to go wrong with our physical and our mental health. And in that way, we can dance with our partner. This is slightly an older version and this is my favorite cuz I'm an English child. Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind. "Pooh," he whispered. "Yes, Piglet?" "Nothing," said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. "I just wanted to be sure of you." And there you go again. Ah! I want that lady to tell me how long I have. How am I doing? Am I doing okay? 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, you've got about 4 minutes. 

00:57:10
SUE JOHNSON Four? Okay. Speed up. All right? I'm not gonna show you this. Yes. The code of attachment tells us the primary need is felt security with another, safe haven to go to, secure base to go out from. The key question is, are you there for me? Are you accessible? Do I matter to you? Are you responsive to my need. Can I depend on you? Are you engaged with me? From this point of view, safe emotional presence and connection is the solution to this problem. And, by the way, it's the only solution. Doing more chores might stop some of the fights but it's not gonna contribute to this. Emotional presence is a social. We have to help people to create that. And I'm not gonna show this piece of tape because I don't have time. 

00:58:05
[sil.] 

00:58:10
SUE JOHNSON All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to, ah, not talk to you about all the-- you-- I've said the basics of Attachment Theory so I'm going to try and go to the piece of tape with, with Tronick. Let me, let me show you this and I tell you why you're looking at it. It's 2 minutes. This is Ed Tronick. 

00:58:30
Edward Tronick, Ph.D. Director Child Development Unit Harvard University 

00:58:35
EDWARD TRONICK Babies this young are extremely responsive to the emotions and reactivity in the social interaction that they get from the world around them. This is something that we started studying, ah, 34 years ago when people didn't think that infants could engage in social interaction. 

00:58:55
The "Still Face" Experiment 

00:59:00
EDWARD TRONICK In the "Still Face" experiment, what the mother did was she sit down and she's playing with her baby who's about a year of age and she gives a greeting to the baby. The baby gives a greeting back to her. This baby starts pointing at different places in the world and the mother is trying to engage her and play with her. They're working to coordinate their emotions and their intentions, what they want to do in the world. And that's really what the baby is used to. And then we asked the mother to not respond to the baby. The baby very picks up on this. And then she uses all of her abilities to try and get the mother back. She smiles at the mother. She points because she's used to the mother looking where she point. The baby puts both hands up in front of her and says, "What's happening here?" She makes that screechy sound at the mother, like, 'come on, why, why aren't we doing this?' Even in this 2 minutes when they don't get the normal reaction, they react with negative emotions. They turn away. They feel the stress of it. They actually lose control of their posture because of the stress that they're experiencing. 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Baby, I'm here. And what are you doing? Oh, yes. Oh, what big girl. 

01:00:50
EDWARD TRONICK It's a little like the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good is the normal stuff that goes on, that we all do with our kid. The bad is when something bad happened but the infant can overcome it. After all, when you stop the "Still Face", the mother and the baby start to play again. The ugly is when, you know, give the child any chance to get back to the good. There's no reparation and they're stuck in that really ugly situation. 

01:01:25
SUE JOHNSON All right. So what I'm gonna suggest you is, I want you to think about what you saw on that tape. I wanna suggest you is that exactly what happens on your couples sessions. Only in your couples session, it sounds different. The baby doesn't turn and go, 'ah!'. The person says, "You did pick up the laundry!" or, "you never wanna make love!" I want you to get if it's the same. It's 'ah!' And I want you to notice that the ways of dealing with it are not very infinite or very sophisticated. Basically, they are, "Are you gonna come baby with me?" which you have in-- as adult, you don't do that usually if the other person becomes dangerous, that's an invitation. They are, "Ah!' Where the hell are you?" which sounds and like an invitation to a fight for most of us. Or, they are this, which the baby also did. "I will shut you off because this hurts and I don't know what to do. And so, I'll shut you off and I'll shut you off by-- literally shut you off. I'll turn away. I'll withdraw. And that's exactly what your clients do. And what we are doing in EFT to put it very simply is, we are getting people to understand this dance, to understand their attachment needs and fears, to deal with them differently so that, in this kind of situation, they can do this in a way that pulls it upon towards them. And for some of these people, they've never actually recognize this invitation or maybe even receive this invitation in their life. So it's foreign territory for them. So you have to help them see it. So I have all kinds of other slides I'm not gonna talk about, but I think I'm saying the main things. Uhm, but maybe I'll just finish by saying, how does this show up, uhm, in couple therapy? How they shows up in couple therapy? Let me give you a feel because people will really see these situations differently according to the glasses you have on, okay? How this turns up in couples therapy is that couple come-- ah, a therapist comes-- calls me up from town and says, "Sue, we have a couple for you." And I'm seeing the woman, she's very depressed and my diagnosis is that she's depressed because she's married to a, uhm, controlling, perfectionist, narcissistic creep. I said, "Oh, there's so many of those around you." So the couple come to see me and indeed he's right. The woman is very depressed and the man talks about, well, he really doesn't know what's happening in this relationship. He's an incredibly reasonable man. He likes physical exercise and he's-- they've been married for 30 years and he wish she'd exercise more. And he wish she'd hike with him and he tells her to go to the gym but he doesn't understand why she's so upset with him. And since she went away to help her sister who was dying, ah, a little while ago and then stayed for 3 months. Since she did that, uhm, somehow something is going on wrong in their relationship and he doesn't understand what's wrong. And when I say to her, "What happened when you, you--" she said, "I think this depression is all about how empty this relationship is for me. And I say, "Can you help me? Was there a moment where you really became aware of it?" She said, "Oh, yes." I said, "Could you help me when was it?" She said, "About a year ago." She said" We were on the train in France. We were on it and we've been hiking and I gone hiking with him and it's very hard for me, you know, but I gone hiking with him. And I'd fallen and he said, "You wouldn't fall if you've gone to the gym more often. So I was feeling a bit sort of funny. And I was standing on the station and I had a cup of coffee and I was pulling our bag and suddenly he realizes that the train is moving." So he runs, gets on the train and starts screaming at the conductor to slow the train and he turns to his wife and he says, "Run!" And she goes, "Uh-hmm, ah, ah, oh, oh-oh!" The train is moving and so finally she, she run. She gets it together with her coffee and her bag and she climbs on the train and he says, "Why are you so goddamn slow?" And she says, "I sat down on the carriage and I said to myself I said, 'I am slow.' I am. I'm not fit like him. I'll never be fit like him. This man has never really accepted me. I don't know how to be around this man. This is something wrong with me. I am slow. And I can't bear this. I just want his own now. I just want his own now." And she became more and more depressed. Now, what interesting is attachment gives me a map to the inner emotional world that people have, how they regulate their emotion and the dances they dance, the way they get stuck and what needs to happen to make it right. Because when I talked to this man, right, he just chat in an intellectual way of, oh, well, it-- he was alarmed because the train was going and this and that. And he can see that she was upset but he doesn't really see what it's all about. So what I do as an EFT therapist, I can give him skills or I could give him explanations. What I want him to do is change his level of emotional engagement so I say to him, "You're on the train. What happens to you when you turn and look at her? What is happening?" And he-- I have to really go there for him to come with me cuz he's off in his head. And he says, "She's standing still. She's frozen. She's standing still." I say, "Right. She's standing still. And what's happening for you?" He says, "Well, she's not moving. She's not moving." I said, "Right. She's not running to catch up. And what's happening?" He says, "Well, I'm-- the distance between us is getting bigger and bigger and bigger." I said, "Right. The distance between you is getting bigger and bigger and she's not moving. And I'm yelling at her and yelling at her and she's not moving. And I'm on the train all by myself." "Right. So let's talk Luis(ph) about what it feels like to feel like you're always on the train all by yourself. And you can't-- you're feeling alone by yourself and you can't get this lady to run fast and to try and being with you and to reach for you, and she can't run as fast as you and you're always worried that she's just gonna stand there and you're gonna be all alone in the train." He says, "Oh, that's me tuning into the attachment channel. Okay. EFT therapists tunes into emotion, tunes into attachment and uses those things as a guide to what's going wrong and as a way forward to create a new relationship. Because look at all the things we can get to. Unless you love someone, nothing makes sense. Thank you. 

01:09:05

01:09:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Hi. Hi. 

01:09:25
SUE JOHNSON Okay. Okay. 

01:09:25
JULIE GOTTMAN So we can go and sit there with the two of you. Wasn't she fabulous people? Of course, she's great. 

01:09:40
[sil.] 

01:09:45
JULIE GOTTMAN All right. So now, we get to ask you a few questions. Here they are. We wrote them down prior to the faery. So, uhm... 

01:09:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Can I, can I say something? 

01:09:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah, go for it. 

01:09:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN So, uhm, here you are in graduate school, the heyday of behavior therapy. 

01:10:05
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:10:05
JOHN M. GOTTMAN And you're, you're visiting Neil Jacobson's lab in Seattle. 

01:10:10
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:10:10
JOHN M. GOTTMAN And ev-- and everyone's talking about cognition and no one is talking about attachment and, and, and family therapy. So, what was like for you to be striking out in this direction? 

01:10:30
SUE JOHNSON Uhm, well, it was, it was sort of scary because, uhm, no one-- it was like, every time I go and listen to lectures, like, I'd go and listen to Neil, uhm, and, uhm, it would be like he was talking to different language in a different world. And so I started to think, "Well, you know, uhm, maybe I'm insane, maybe there's something weird." 

01:10:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:10:55
SUE JOHNSON Cuz, you know, ah, nobody else seems to think this way. And in the beginning in EFT, I wasn't really tuning into attachment. You know, I sort of knew about it off in my head but I wasn't really-- we did the first whole study without really getting the attachment implications and what we, we-- right, we did that first study and we got these results in that first study and I couldn't believe them. I mean, I random - 

01:11:20
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:11:20
SUE JOHNSON - three times. I think I told you that. I thought that we could got these results, like, I don't even know I'm doing really. You know, what-- how can we got these results? So I was sort of confuse. But then I went to a big conference and I heard and, uhm, I watched Neil. Actually, Neil had a big impact on me. Uhm, he, he stood up and he said, "Relationships are bargains. Uhm, they're about profits and loss. And they're bargains. You can negotiate for everything. And, and love is just a bargain. And, uhm, I, and I was in a bar and if-- those of you know me I grew up in an English pub so all my deep, deep moments happened in bars for some reason. And I don't even drink very much so it's not, you know, like-- but, uhm, I was in this bar and I think it was less said to me, "He's wrong, isn't he?" And I said, "Oh, yes, of course he's wrong." Right. And he said, "But why is he wrong?" I said, "Well, you know, I don't know. All I know is that emotion is the most powerful thing in the room and he doesn't touch it at all. He just thinks it goes with thought. And if you change thought, you'll change emotion - 

01:12:35
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:12:35
SUE JOHNSON - which is-- there's no evidence. I don't, I don't think that's highly questionable. 

01:12:40
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:12:40
SUE JOHNSON In, in fact, it's the other way. I think it's highly questionable. Emotion will change thought much easier than the other way around but also an intimate relationships to dismiss emotion. But-- and he-- I-- he said, he said, "Well, why is he on it?" I said, "Well, relationships-- intimate relationships aren't, uhm, bargains." He said, "All right. Then, what are they?" I said, "Uhm, they're bonds." And I still the story. I was sitting on and, and the view at the window, it was like, "Oh, my god." They are bonds. There-- it's John Bowlby. There's nobody was writing about adult attachment. They were just writing about mother and kid. 

01:13:20
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:13:20
SUE JOHNSON So I tried to write it up for the Journal of marriage and family therapy and no one woul-- and they-- and, uhm, they won't publish it cuz people keep saying it is rubbish. Uhm, adults don't need this kind of bonding. But you don't need this. And finally... 

01:13:35
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Only babies need it. 

01:13:35
SUE JOHNSON Only babies need it. And Alan Gurman-- blessed his heart-- who was the editor said, "I'm sick of sending this out for review. I'm half the people who liking it and half the people hating it. I like it so I'm publishing it." And then the next year, uhm, Phil Shaver started to publish all these, these things, uhm, on adult attachments saying, "We think the same thing is happening in adults." But actually, John, it was very, uhm, confusing and scary, but in those days, I was, uhm, rather bloody-minded and I just get ticked off and just think, "Well, I don't care." And I go back and look at my client-- my couples and they would, they would come with me. 

01:14:15
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:14:15
SUE JOHNSON It made sense to them. 

01:14:15
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:14:15
SUE JOHNSON And, and I started to seeing them change and I thought, "Well, I'm just gonna trust what's in front of me." 

01:14:25
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:14:25
SUE JOHNSON But then you, I started reading your articles and you started saying wonderful things like, "Emotion matters." Right? And there's this patterns, right? I mean that was, - 

01:14:35
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:14:35
SUE JOHNSON - that was huge cuz it was, uhm, pretty lonely actually. 

01:14:40
JOHN M. GOTTMAN You led, you led us in a new direction all by yourself. 

01:14:45
JULIE GOTTMAN That's right. 

01:14:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN You led us in a new direction. 

01:14:50
[sil.] 

01:14:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Uhuh. So, to capture the emotion, uhm, you love doing couples work. 

01:15:05
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:15:10
JULIE GOTTMAN You adore it. 

01:15:10
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:15:10
JULIE GOTTMAN You love it. It means so much to you. 

01:15:15
SUE JOHNSON Yep. 

01:15:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Why couples work rather than individual or family work? 

01:15:20
SUE JOHNSON Well, uhm, I don't know. I think it was a huge challenge. You know, I, I thought I was reasonable individual therapist when I started seeing couples. And I worked with families in this treatment center. And then, I walked in and I was told, "Okay. Now you've got to see all of these couples as your last, uhm, clinical assignment in your doctorate. You got to see all these couples." And I couldn't do it. 

01:15:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:15:45
SUE JOHNSON And that fascinated me. I couldn't calm them down. I couldn't stop them fighting. I didn't know really what was wrong. I mean, I, I c-- I was-- I think some of that was the puzzle what - 

01:15:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:15:55
SUE JOHNSON - you're talking about. You, you want to solve the puzzle. But I think there was that part of it. But I also think, uhm, that there's something about close relationships and I also think that some of it was very personal. The, the-- one of the big factors in my life as a child- I was an only-- the mo-- biggest factor in my life growing up was the, uhm, I knew that my parents love each other. Uhm, you know, they were a bit kind of that book that just come out about, uhm, Lisa Taylor and - 

01:16:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Richard Burton. 

01:16:30
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Richard Burton. 

01:16:30
SUE JOHNSON - and Richard, yeah. I read that book. I thought, "Good Lord! It's my parents." Except they didn't have diamond rings and, you know-- uhm, but I knew they loved each other and basically I watched them destroy each other. 

01:16:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:16:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:16:45
SUE JOHNSON So that was also fascinating to me cuz I can remember thinking as a child, what, what is this? 

01:16:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:16:55
SUE JOHNSON And I think it was the two things. If I'd said to myself, "Oh, they don't love each other then it would just to be a kind of, ah, put aside," if you understand me. 

01:17:05
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:17:05
SUE JOHNSON But I think the tantalizing thing was I knew they loved each other. That wasn't the issue. But, but they also destroyed each other. And, uhm, my big attachment think it was my father and, uhm... 

01:17:20
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Who was a big, strong commando. 

01:17:20
SUE JOHNSON He was a big, strong commando. And as I told the, uhm, commando of the U.S. Army Leavenworth when we went to do some work there, he said to me, "Why are you here?" Good question. "You're, you're a Canadian. Why are you here?" I'm here because my father could deal with everything that happened to him in the Second World War, but he could not deal with my mother leaving him and he never got over it. 

01:17:50
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:17:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Hmm. 

01:17:50
SUE JOHNSON And so I think that has something to do with my fascination for relationships. 

01:17:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN It's the puzzle. 

01:17:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:17:55
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:17:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:17:55
SUE JOHNSON But, you know, I mean, - 

01:18:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. 

01:18:00
SUE JOHNSON - if you'd ask me when I was 15 years old, I have told you marriage is for soccers and I'm not doing it. 

01:18:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Thanks god you changed. 

01:18:10
JOHN M. GOTTMAN I like that. 

01:18:10
SUE JOHNSON Sorry sweetie. 

01:18:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah, beautiful. 

01:18:20
JOHN M. GOTTMAN One thing, I, I, I wanted to ask. Until the end, I talked about this, ah, you know, when we-- when we're on our annual honeymoon, we were, we were wondering what your experiences were as you take EFT around the world. 

01:18:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Hmm. 

01:18:35
JOHN M. GOTTMAN What, what do you experience here. What, what are the challenges. What are the-- what's the universality you see and what are the challenges? 

01:18:45
SUE JOHNSON Well, I work with, uhm, about 35 wonderful EFT trainers who are the most amazingly talented group of people. And, uhm, they actually take EFT to more distant places than I go these days. But, uhm, I think what we find is we find that the-- there is-- that the universality of emotion and attachment is universal, is wired into our brain - 

01:19:10
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:19:10
SUE JOHNSON - and, and that is validated for us all the time. 

01:19:15
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:19:15
SUE JOHNSON But we also find-- well, I'm surprised by sometimes is this hunger that people have, that, that sometimes you think, well, if they grew up in a different culture, what they really feel is the same hunger. And I think that our experiences that this hunger for connection and for closeness and to matter to other people and to have this safe haven, they-- it's there. It's there even in cultures where they have arranged marriages. 

01:19:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:19:45
SUE JOHNSON Still those people hope to find that connection - 

01:19:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:19:45
SUE JOHNSON - in the man that they've been to marry. You know, it's- the, the hunger is there. But I think we also learn that you have to respect how-- particularly, how people have been taught to regulate their emotions. So, you know, if you're going to work with a Japanese couple, you have to take-- you let them teach you. In a way, every couple is a different culture - 

01:20:10
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:20:10
SUE JOHNSON - so you have to let them - 

01:20:10
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:20:10
SUE JOHNSON - teach you their reality, you know, and, you know, what is okay in that culture. And, uhm, I remember working with a Japanese couple and learning all about-- I can't remember the exact word now, maybe there's someone in the audience who does-- but I think it's called 'ami(ph)' but it's, it's something about respect and honor. And, you know, if you're gonna create safety for that couple, you have to help them talk to each other in a way that they show respect and honor to each other. So, and we, we learn. We, we do that. We, we, - 

01:20:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yep. 

01:20:45
SUE JOHNSON - we learn from the couples, right? And, you know-- I mean, sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. You know, I remember working with an Irish Catholic couple and I was brought up by the nuns so I know the-- all the words to use, you know, and he, he knows that I know what he means when he turns and says to me, "Look at her. Now you see what it's like to be married to Jehovah." I, I sort of-- I made a big mistake there cuz I giggled which she didn't like. But, uhm, you know, - 

01:21:20
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:21:20
SUE JOHNSON - so I think sometimes you have to work harder. But-- for example, working with-- we work with stroke patients and that was just fas-- I haven't done a lot of that. That is some of my colleagues at the institute and they have, uhm, a speech therapist come in and we have props for them to help, help them so that they can find the words. They'll point to a face - 

01:21:40
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:21:40
SUE JOHNSON - of an emotion. But I've done it-- I've done a couple of couples like that with Kathy who is the person who has done that in our institute. It blows my mind. 

01:21:50
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yep. 

01:21:50
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, but we have to adapt a lot of things for that. A lot of things for that, right? 

01:21:55
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Hmm. 

01:21:55
SUE JOHNSON And, uhm, so we do adapt-- I mean, one of the big things that happened in EFT when we were in the hospital is the big adaption. It was that all these trauma patients started and we can talk about that this afternoon. They starting turning up. We didn't say, "Oh, let's apply EFT to trauma." 

01:22:15
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yep. 

01:22:15
SUE JOHNSON They started coming and droves. And I remember somebody saying, "Well, what are we gonna do with them?" I said, "Well, I guess we're just gonna learn how to work with them and we're gonna see if EFT fits or not, right? So, uhm, basically we let them teach us. 

01:22:30
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:22:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah. You know, that's one of the things that we really have in common I think. 

01:22:35
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:22:35
JULIE GOTTMAN It's that, you know, couples are the best teachers. 

01:22:35
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:22:35
JULIE GOTTMAN They tell us everything. 

01:22:40
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:22:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. You know, they allow us into their worlds. 

01:22:40
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:22:45
JULIE GOTTMAN And then we learn from them. We understand how to witness them because - 

01:22:50
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:22:50
JULIE GOTTMAN - they allow us in. 

01:22:50
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:22:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Right? So, you know, one of the things-- as, as long as we're talking about, uhm, these other cultures, I'm curious because your relation-- your work is totally emotionally focused. Notice I did it the grammatically - 

01:23:05
SUE JOHNSON Thank you. 

01:23:10
JULIE GOTTMAN - way. emotionally focused. Uhm, how do you open the door to, I think, probably especially men in other cultures who have been taught since infancy that to, to show emotion is weakness and bad. And we have in our culture as well of course. 

01:23:30
SUE JOHNSON Uh-hmm. 

01:23:35
JULIE GOTTMAN So how do you open the door for people like that? 

01:23:35
SUE JOHNSON It's an interesting one though because right from the beginning in EFT people would say, "Well, how do you do this with, uhm, very avoidant men?" And in the predictive study we found that works very, very well for men who were called 'inexpressive' by their partner. And I think it's something, it's something about the fact-- if you know it's there and you know it's there. 

01:24:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. 

01:24:05
SUE JOHNSON So when-- we'll do an exercise tomorrow where the woman said something really awful to the man and I say to him, "How do you, how do you feel when she says that?" And she says, "Nothing." Well, my response to that is, if you are a mammal and you are not dead, that is impossible. In which case you are working very, very hard to feel nothing? In which case, all I have to do is get in the way of that. And I get in the way of it by saying-- by-- first of all, I get in the way of it by staying there and saying, "You feel nothing? As your partners turns to you and says, "He's the cue again, buddy. Here it comes. I'm speaking to your amygdala. Here's the cue again, okay?" And he looks at me and I say it again. "You feel nothing as she says, right?" And he-- you can see him starting to lose it and I've nearly done it three times. You can see it. He's starting to lose. What James Gross says, is emotional suppression is exceedingly hard work. 

01:25:15
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:25:15
SUE JOHNSON It stresses your body out and you can't do it very long. So, we've learned really over the years how to stay there. A lot of it is the safety you create. You validate people. And you validate that it's hard for them to feel. You say, "Of course, it's hard for you to stay with your emotions. You, you learn not to do that and you believe that that was to be strong. And of course that's hard for you. Our experiences, if you make safety and you help people walk into it, and you a map for what they're feeling so you can help them walk in. It's actually not that hard. In fact, actually, in terms of withdrawn partners, male or female, it's quite unusual among the EFT community. We sort of talk about how it's unusual for us not to be able to get shut down withdrawn people engage. Mind you, engagement is relative, right, but engage enough. If you're gonna get stuck anywhere in EFT, you're more likely to get stuck in the second stage of EFT when the person who has been yelling and screaming and yelling and screaming and say, "Okay, let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!" and suddenly, the other person turns around and says, "Okay, sweetie. Here I am. Let's dance." And that person goes, "Ah! No, I don't think so, maybe next year after I tested you 8,000 times." 

01:26:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Exactly. 

01:26:50
SUE JOHNSON That's harder. That's much harder. And people say things like I want him to prove to me that he's never gonna hurt me again and he's never gonna reject me. And I say, "He can't. He can't prove to you--" well, I don't say quite like this. This is-- and we're, we're chatting here, right, but, you know, he can't because the bottom line is she's hypervigilant for risk. So he-- she's only gonna notice the times when he blows it. And he's gonna blow it cuz she assumed it be, right? 

01:27:20
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:27:20
SUE JOHNSON So, so he-- I say, "He can't. Let's talk about how afraid you are to risk." She said, "No. Let's talk about how you're gonna prove to me." "Now, let's talk about how afraid you are to risk." Right. So then you go in and you validate that more lightly place to get start than the withdrawn... 

01:27:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Opening up and... 

01:27:45
SUE JOHNSON Yes. Because I, I believe James Gross. It really is. His research makes amazing sense to me when he says a suppression of affect is incredibly difficult. The other thing he found by the way was he said, the suppression of affect did incredibly difficult, stresses the hell out of you. It's literally hard work. And, by the way, it doesn't work because you're pushing this emotion down and it's coming up and you're pushing it down and you get more aroused. But here's the thing that fascinated me and so does anyone sitting close to you. So does anyone you're interacting with lethal on your partner so I think that's very interesting. Right? 

01:28:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-hmm. 

01:28:25
JOHN M. GOTTMAN But he does say that, he does say sometime it's a good idea to suppress emotion. 

01:28:30
SUE JOHNSON Sure. It's a good idea to-- and when work with... 

01:28:30
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Sometimes it's very functional. 

01:28:30
SUE JOHNSON We're gonna see somebody - 

01:28:35
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:28:35
SUE JOHNSON - this afternoon I think where he says-- where we say to him, "Of course, you learn to suppress emotion. You are, you are a helicopter pilot in Iraq." 

01:28:40
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. 

01:28:45
SUE JOHNSON There were times when suppressing emotion was absolutely important. 

01:28:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. Yeah. 

01:28:45
SUE JOHNSON But if it's all you do - 

01:28:45
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Right. Exactly. Yeah. No. Right. 

01:28:45
SUE JOHNSON - in your relationship right now you're in deep trouble. 

01:28:50
JULIE GOTTMAN That's right. 

01:28:50
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:28:50
JULIE GOTTMAN And we don't want you to be in deep hunger. So, we're gonna stop for lunch now. And let's have lunch and we'll see you this afternoon. Thank you very much. 

01:29:05
JOHN M. GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:29:10
PTSD and Trauma in Couples Work 

01:29:20
SUE JOHNSON Okay, so we are going to talk about, uhm, EFT working with a particular subpopulation which is EFT with trauma survivors. I'm gonna talk for about 15 minutes and I'm gonna show you a piece of tape of our latest, uhm, training tape which is called "EFT in action" which is me working with a, uhm-- doing a supervision of a man-- a therapist in San Diego who's working with this couple, extremely distressed couple, uhm, where the man was an Iraqi helicopter pilot. And then you see doing supervision on the tape and then I do a session with the couple, and then we talk about it afterwards. You're gonna se about 13 minutes of that, that, uhm, piece of tape. And what is interesting about the couple I'll show you is that the man is a helicopter pilot who's been diagnosed with full-blown PTSD. He's either numbed out or, uhm, enraged. And-- but what is that extra complications, they are highly escalated couple because she's very, very, very agitated by what is happening to her partner. And she is doing what most couples do if no one helps them, she's taking all his PTSD symptoms personally. And it's, uhm, turning on attachment panic in her. So, uhm, I, I can't remember I said this morning actually but I hope I-- here is a bit of a rush, but I hope I said that Jaak Panksepp there's a special pathway in the mammalian brain for fear that is associated with being abandoned and rejected and he calls it primal panic. So, afternoon, the traumatized couple you'll see, PTSD, which is all about physical fear and danger and not being able to regulate your emotion, further complicated by the primal panic of attachment, of abandonment, and rejection. Uhm, but anyway, so I'm gonna show you that. And then we'll stop and, and then Julie is going a little piece on trauma and talk a little piece on trauma. And, uhm, so we'll go from there. So, uhm, if you are particularly interested in EFT, for trauma you should have a look at the emotionally focused couple therapy with trauma survivors. I, I wrote that in 2002. It's my favorite book mostly cuz I wrote it on a beach in New Zealand. Instead of my little study surrounded by books, uhm, so-- uhm, and, ah, basically, this book is based on the fact t hat for about 11 years, I ran a marital and therapy clinic, you know, a big local hospital in the Department of Psychiatry and that we would get all the couples and families that nobody else wanted to treat. And a very large number of those folks were trauma survivors. They were survivors from trauma from traffic accidents, trauma from cancer treatments, trauma from war vets. We, we continue to see a lot of war vets and we're very active in helping EFT therapists who are working within the VA system, uhm, to-- we have an EFT community in the VA system to help people work with war vets. Ah, but also, uhm, we would see a lot of people who had being sexually abused-- these children-- who are incest survivors, uhm, and who would come into that clinic with enormous mental health problems and relationship problems. And I think we are the only couple therapy I know who's actually done a small pilot study, outcome study on, uhm, EFT with couple therapy with people who have context PTSD, that is people who have been violated by attachment figures in their past-- MacIntosh and Johnson. Uhm, we didn't go-- we didn't have the courage to go out and, and intentionally set up that study. We wanted to find nice, clean, neat, simple little PTSD cases and bring them into therapy but we can't find them. And suddenly, I, I was sick for a while, when I came back for my lab there were these couples and I made basic response wasn't pretty. It was something like, "Good gah-grief" you know, these people, you know, are like there's trauma is everywhere and they're, they're-- you know, most of them incest survivors and-- anyway we work with them cuz they were there. So if you're interested in that, it's MacIntosh and Johnson. There are about four studies of EFT with trauma. Uhm, and of course, it's more complicated if you're going to- it's dangerous territory for couples in a, in a relationship that-- where they feel like they're falling through space and they have no safety. But if you add also that there's a dragon in the room called the "dragon of trauma" that makes affect regulation less impossible then you have to take much more care of trauma, ah, couples. You have to make much more safety and you have to accept the fact that usually progress does not do this or even this. Progress will be very rocky. And what we learned from the hospital is, you have to just expect relapses and take them in stride and not give up on, on people. So, we think that EFT is particularly suited to, uhm, working with trauma survivors because emotional attachment is a primary protection against feelings of helplessness and meaninglessness. That's, uhm, it follow (inaudible ) Vandercook. A deep sense of belonging results in the taming of fear. Proximity to an attachment figure tranquilizes the nervous system when one is confident that an attachment figure will be there when needed. A person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will be an individual that has no such confidence. To put it in, uhm, couple therapy terms, can you imagine the difference it makes in a woman's life who has started to have massive flash-- flashbacks of sexual abuse in her childhood? And when she comes to see me, the way she deals with this is she has the flashbacks in the middle of the night and she goes into the washroom and she cuts herself all down the inside of her legs, uhm, to, uhm, to numb herself out. Because actually, the physical pain is a relief from the-- all this awful emotional pain. She has some control over the physical pain. Unfortunately, then, when she wakes up in the morning, she's consumed with shame. And, you know, she hides from the rest of her family and she hides from her husband for 2 weeks and then the whole thing happens again. Imagine the shift when in the middle of the night when she has to flashback, she puts her hand on her husband's arm and says, "It's come for me." And he knows what she means because they've talked about it therapy. My mic is falling off here. He knows what she means because they've talked about it in the therapy and he simply turns and holds her. And she gradually calms down in her ar-- in his arms and she wakes up in the morning-- when she wakes up in the morning in his arms, she is a person who has learned to be comforted. She is a person who has dealt with her trauma survivor-- her trauma symptoms differently. And the trauma is somehow something she can cope with, with her husband's help and she feels closer to him. He feels good that he's protected her from the dragon. All kinds of amazing things happened there in terms of healing. Right, so the natural place that we heal is in our closest relationships. I'm not gonna talk a lot about post-traumatic stress disorder. Enough to say that, especially, we need attention to PTSD that is-- that where the PTSD has been inflicted. The trauma has been inflicted by attachment figures. Where people have through a violation of human connection, there has been for human design. And Herman says that this violation of human connection is particularly toxic because it cuts off the main healing path for trauma. You-- how do you turn-- when people have been so dangerous to you, how do you use the main way we have of healing which is turning to other people, letting them comfort you so you are stuck in a dark place with the dragon all by yourself, right. And if we know anything from modern science, we know that isola-- emotional isolation will take any difficulty. You're having mental or physical or emotional and put it on the roof, because we're not designed to deal with pain and uncertainty alone. So in terms of symptoms of PTSD, the only thing I wanna say is, outstandingly, the research says that the symptom that is puts people most at risk for continuing PTSD, the symptom that really predicts whether you're likely to heal or not is avoidance and numbing. And I believe in the new DSM, they are dividing those into two. They are, they are one here-- avoidance and numbing. And you look at the attachment association restricted affect estrangement from others. So one of the huge issues with trauma is that people shut down and numb out and nobody can reach them and they cannot reach for others. And one of the things I think about couple therapy for trauma is, it's a way into that. It's a way into creating a place for people not be alone with their trauma and learning how to turn to others and helping others turn and support them. By the way, some people say, well, you can't expect the spouse to do that because it's a lot to ask for. Maybe, but in nature, there's something called mate guarding. The loon on my lake, I never get anywhere close to the loon on my lake's nest in the kayak. Because the minute I come into the bay, the adult loon comes up out of the water and threatens me. Okay. And my experience is, in EFT when people really realize that their partner is not trying to be mean, and ha-- isn't crazy and isn't trying to hurt them, that their partner is facing a dragon and, and fighting for their lives. And, unfortunately, sometimes the dragon looks like this standing right behind you, right, and this person is looks like they're, they're battling a battle and you're in the way because the dragon's-- and you become the threat. Once people realize that, they do what they do in all the old love stories. Once the man realizes the maiden is tied to a post, she can't come towards him cuz he's tied to a post and this dragon for her. What does he do? He gets on his horse. He gets in his horse and he comes into the fight and he protect his lady. So, when people really realize how vulnerable the other person is, I've seen the most amazingly humbling amounts of empathy and caring and compassion. And people do amazingly heroic things in order to protect their loved one from danger. That's an instinct we all have I think. Okay. So, uhm, let me keep going here. I'm not gonna do that. So trauma that's a violation of human connection increase our need for other people for a safe haven to go to, for a secure base to go out from, increases our needs for a safe sense of emotional connection. At the same time, if you have been violated by others in particular. For example, you've been incested, that is combined with a lack of trust and vigilance for danger. So you have a double whammy here. You're stuck. Your need for other people is enormous cuz life is dangerous. Your inside emotions are dangerous. They can trick you into a flashback any moment. The outside world is dangerous. And at the same time, when you think about turning into your partner, somehow your amygdala goes berserk and says, "Excuse me. That person is dangerous too." The other person is the source of safety, the solution to danger and a source of danger, a source of fear. This is an amazingly terrible paradox and it has people doing things that look crazy. If you understand the attachment dance they are dancing, they don't look crazy. It makes ultimate sense. One of the reasons I'm so, uhm, tied to attachment is I don't think I've ever since a couple where attachment didn't make sense of their inner realities, their inner emotional realities and the kind of crazy moves that they do with each other in their dance of distress. So what you start to have in this situation is what we call fearful avoidant0. attachment, problems in affect regulation, information processing and communication, more and more distress in the relationship and more risk of reoccurrence of violation and the maintenance of symptoms. You get lack of safe haven in the relationship perpetuates the trauma, and the effects of trauma in our limited way of regulating our emotions around trauma perpetuate the distress in the relationship and the lack of a secure base and you get a lock in, and I call it the trauma trap, where the way you relate to your partner makes your trauma symptoms worse, your trauma escalating trauma symptoms drive your partner away, make your relationship impossible. And it just becomes a downward spiral. Oh! Recovery from trauma includes the construction of a clear integrated narrative of the trauma and consequences for the self and for relatedness. You've got a sense of mastering coherence. For example, you begin to see the dragon in the dance. When we help people understand the horrible cycles of interaction that they caught in, we put the dragon in the dance. We help them understand that one person is constantly trying to regulate their emotions, dealing with all this fear and panic, I mean, as they try to dance with you, right? By putting into words, I can make it whole. This wholeness means it has lost the power to hurt me. Every time I put this up on a slide, I believe it's true. We also have to remember that, that Virginia Woolf committed suicide. So, the regulation of affect, positive strategy is what we try to do is help people turn to each other. In general in EFT, we help people turn to each other so that there is less flooding, less being overwhelmed. In our culture and in our profession, I think there is an inherent dichotomy between this idea that we should self-regulate our emotions. And we should be able to self-suite and self-regulate our emotion with things like, for example, mindfulness. And the idea that actually it's okay to turn to other people and use our relationships to regulate our emotions. And, in general, number one is incredibly powerful. If you look at all the magazines for example, you know, everyone is talking about how you need to be able to soothe yourself and take care of yourself, et cetera, et cetera. What the neuroscience suggest is, that the way we are wired, the most effective, efficient and natural way for us to regulate our emotions particularly when they are overwhelming and traumatic is to turn to other people not rely on self-soothing. 9/11 Chris Fraley. Chris Fraley is an attachment researcher. He went to look at the people who were in the vicinity when the towers came down. And he looked at them when the towers came down at nine-- 18 months later. He said the people who had secure attachments who would say, when I would get upset and, and start to think about, uhm, what was happening with the towers that, that way. I could turn and confide and I could go to my wife and I would cry and she would hold me. And I would talk to her and we would have an arrangement where if I started to have a flashback I could call her. And just hearing her voice calms me down. The people that said that were doing just fine 18 months later. In fact, they were actually talking about how the whole experience had been in some ways are growth experience for them. They'd become more spiritual. They'd somehow recognize something about the preciousness of life. Anxiously and avoidantly attached folks who say things like, "I don't believe other people were there for me. I tried to talk to them all the time but they don't really listen-- then that they don't really care about my feelings." Or, people who said, "I'm not comfortable with closeness. I think I should deal with this all by myself. I don't want to talk about it. Those folks were both having lots of PTSD symptoms nine-- uhm, 18 months after 9/11. So this is just one study but I could quote you 50 that talks about from the studies with the Israeli army, from studies with police officers, from all kinds of people that secure attachment is the very best antidote to being overwhelm with negative affect. Being able to turn to other people is our greatest strength and it actually teaches. The only way to learn to self-soothe on some level is to be able to turn to other people. What we try to give people is a new corrective experience of relatedness, most secure connection, less isolation, interactions that provi-- pro-- uhm, create antidotes to the violation of human connection that got them stuck in the first place. Traumatic experience floods us with physical fear and helplessness secure attachment of safe haven. Traumatic experience callous the world as dangerous and unpredictable. Secure attachment promotes affect regulation and integration. Se-- ah, traumatic experience creates overwhelming emotional chaos and threatens a cohesive sense of self, assault self-efficacy and a sense of self-control and scrambles the ability to fully engage in the presence and so adapt to new situations. Secure attachments promotes personality integration, trust in the self and others, open this to experience, risk-taking a new learning and engagement in the here and now. So you can see the kind of difference here. Okay. So, I think-- yes, (inaudible ). Okay, I'm gonna show the tape. How is relationship repair-- this keeps falling off so I'm gonna hold the damn thing. Is that all right if I do that?

UNKNOWN Yeah.

SUE JOHNSON So, how is relationship repair different from-- with traumatized couples? First of all, in traumatized couple should gonna get more distress, more absorbing negative affect states, more intense cycles of distance, defense and distrust. That's just the way it is. When the dragon is in the room, affect is different-- is difficult to regulate. You need to put in a psycho educational component regarding trauma and how it impacts the victims responses in the relationship is necessary. Violence and substance abuse are more endemic, particularly substance abuse to numb out the effects of trauma. The alliance with the therapist is more fragile. Many of these people have no reason to trust another human being again. You have to earn their trust. Educational storms and crises much be expected. Emotion has to be contained and soothe as well as heightened and I believe you have somewhere in your file, a reference to a chapter where you can see a transcript of me dealing with a woman having an active flashback in my session and calming her down and grounding her. What I want you to know is I calm her down, I ground her, and then we go back to the task in hand which is helping her start to risk with her partner. Uhm, shame over rise even positive cues. The destination is different. For example, with incest survivors, you need to help them define what they mean by sexuality and the kind of sexuality they want. You have to coordinate with other therapists and safety is everything. You have to-- if you're working with trauma survivors, you have to slice all the risks thin and you have to support them at every step. Okay. So I think what I wanna do is I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna show you the couple from EFT in Action. He has been diagnosed with PTSD and what he's gonna talk about-- just to help you tune into it-- is that he has two ways of filling his emotions these days. One is, he doesn't feel anything and the other way is, he's right over the top in rage. She is very agitated, very anxiously attached and beside herself because she cannot get him to be present and engaged with her. So she keeps triggering all his numbing out and rage responses. And it's like watching-- it's kind of like watching an accident happen. Okay, so I just want you to watch this little bit and see the kind of ways I deal with this. I think it sort of speaks for itself. And then, maybe I'll make a couple of comments at the end and I think that's all. We'll have time for us. So, can we watch a piece from EFT in Action with matching real piece?
