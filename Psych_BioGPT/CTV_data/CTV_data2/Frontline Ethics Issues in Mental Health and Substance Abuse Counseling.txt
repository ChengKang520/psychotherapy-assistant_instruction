00:01:20
PEGGY KEILHOLZ I'm very happy to be here, Tom. 

00:01:25
THOM PANCELLA Though it's good to kind a start with some foundation so why don't you tell us what, what is ethics? 

00:01:25
Peggy J. Keilholz, ACSW, CASAC 

00:01:30
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, very simply if you go to dictionary and look it up you find out that this is the discipline that deals of what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation. It's one of the branches of philosophy and it sometimes goes by another name moral philosophy. 

00:01:45
THOM PANCELLA Why is there such, ah, a great interest in, in ethics and ethics education right now? 

00:01:50
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well I, I think, ah, the, the current circumstances in which our country find itself is result of the not applying ethics there in the business world. So, if you look at the literature ethics is discuss in many, many areas. And the interest, ah, particularly here in Missouri has been spurred by the, ah, state committee that licensed as clinical social workers requiring that every licensed renewal period the clinical social worker have at least three clock hours in social work ethics. So it's a good thing to have, ah, but oftentimes something that people don't wanna spend a lot of time talking about, ah, I think because people are conscientious of discussion of ethics usually gets them anxious. And so they would rather not talk about it. And yet it's very important to talk about because its, its, it's so easy for people to get into, ah, to trouble, ah, before they know it any area of ethics. And so, ah, typically in the professions one of the, the major areas that we have found over the years were people are in trouble ethically is in the area of having sexual intimacy with clients. And I'm sure that every professional has heard somewhere in their training not to do that and yet it, it wind-- ends up being a very common ethical violation. Now, some others have also been become more common as a clinical social worker have, ah, so a third party reimbursement from insurance companies or Medicare and Medicaid providers. Ah, people also get into trouble by, ah, a misrepresenting of what they have done with the client or whether or not they even had sessions and, and that constitutes from fraud so that becomes another area of, of ethical difficulty for people. 

00:03:45
THOM PANCELLA So what is an ethical dilemma? 

00:03:50
PEGGY KEILHOLZ An ethical dilemma and here I, I like, ah, Ellen Burkemper's, ah, definition-- Ellen is, ah, assistant professor at Saint Louis University and teaches Social Work Ethics. She defines an ethical dilemma as two or more good reasons to make two or more reasonable decisions. So, there some way in which the ethical, ah, principles of a profession are in conflict with one another. Uhm, and other authors add to Ellen definition that in that process of coming to make of choosing between those two reasonable decisions, one of the ethical principles is compromised in the process. So that is why constitute an ethical dilemma. I have something in front of me and I've got two or more different ways to go and I have two or more good reasons for going any of those directions. 

00:04:45
THOM PANCELLA I think, ah, examples are always very powerful, can you give us some examples? 

00:04:50
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, let just take a very simple one. Uhm, let say I'm working for an agency, uhm, let say a counseling agency. And a client and scheduling a session, uhm, that the very first one is, uhm, that there'll be record kept, okay. Now, ah, there's-- there are couple of ethical or principles that or, ah, issues here. One is, ah, first of all we recognized that clients have autonomy that's the ability of a free person to make free decisions, and, ah, that usually frame in social work terms as the clients right to self-determination. So in this example we could say, well the client has the right, ah, in his or herself determination to say, I don't wanna record kept. However, we go to other parts of the Code of Ethics and for the social workers that NASW Code of Ethics the National Association of Social Workers and it clearly says we should keep a record, okay. So see there's-- there is the dilemma. And furthermore, if we look at the safe regulations that govern the practice of Clinical Social Worker in Missouri it says we will keep records. So I-- the dilemma there would be how do honor the clients request for nothing and the obligations that I have toward the, ah, organization that I work for or even myself in private practice to keep a record. 

00:06:25
THOM PANCELLA Well, how you go about resolving something like that? 

00:06:30
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, I like to follow the work of, of Karen Kitchener and, ah, she wrote principally for the Clinical Psychologist but I think she really outline very well the different though what I could call the process of ethical reasoning because that's what we are really talking about here as a process. And in a process there are many factors to consider. And she begins with what she would call the intuitive level. Uhm, and most of us have an idea of what intuition is. But she breaks that out into four areas, one is the, ah, it just looking the facts of the situation. So, whatever has been presented to me I just look at the facts, okay. So here's a client whose ask not to have a record kept. I worked in an organization the law is this the regulation say this Code of Ethics says that those are-- those were the facts. Then I have my own ordinary moral sets and, uhm, so when I hear somebody say something like that, uhm, I probably have an initial reaction to it and my ordinary moral sense might tell really it doesn't sound like a good idea or why does-- why is this person asking for that. Ah , and then I have my major reaction, my initial response to it. And then my own the own you-- my use of myself, ah, what have been-- what have been my experience is in this particular area, ah, is that a positive or a negative thing that somebody would even ask that there be no record kept at all. So, uhm, I'm gonna be looking at all of those now that but that just the beginning, okay. Uhm, so the way would taken that to the next step which is what Kitchener calls a clinical evaluative level. And at that level she articulates five meta ethical principles, no these are found in the-- in the literature. And what we mean by a meta ethical principle is that if I look at the Codes of Ethics of the various professions, social work substance abuse counseling, clinical psychology counselors and, and so on. These are principles that I'm going to find in all of those Codes of Ethics, they're not unique to one code. And basically those are five of principles autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, fidelity and justice. Look at any Code of Ethics and you're gonna find those five meta-ethical principles in there. So in this case we have, uhm, the client asking that nothing be kept so that the person would have absolute confidentiality and privilege with the worker. That would come under the ethical principle of autonomy. The next one is non-maleficence and that means to do no harm. Now it is possible that either in my experience or their client experience the fact that somebody had a record may have done harm to that client. Uhm, ah, typical example of that is, ah, lot of time a social worker or substance abuse counselor, marriage and family therapies has a couple for couples counseling and the marriage, ah, are their relationship didn't continue and there's a divorce and now it becomes contentious and the legal system ask for those records. And generally that's why people don't wanna record because something has happened in the legal process which burned them. Well, that would come under that principle of non-maleficence which is to do no harm. However, I also have to look at what harm might come let say to myself or to my agency if I didn't keep a record. Ah, worse case scenario would be one that happen to a, ah, let's report it on the national level by AAMFT and that was a therapies to kept no records but client kept a journal. And as this unfolded, ah, that therapy went, ah, self we might say, and, ah, the client ended up making a complaint, well who had the record. The therapist had none, the client had the record. Ah, having kept the journal and made an entry after every session, okay. So that, that principle we have to find out it's not just the client being harm that's who else might be harm in that process. Beneficence speaks to my, my doing good, uhm, and, ah, is a good thing that have a record I think to myself you know what would it be like if my mechanic didn't keep the record. I you know, it's, it's hard to keep track of what I'm doing with somebody if I don't have, ah, some, ah, some, ah, notes that indicate well this is what happen the last time, ah, this is how the client appears to be doing better or maybe not doing so well and this is the plan for the next time. So that's part of that but beneficence also includes am I looking at, uhm, evidence based practice or empirically supported treatment so that I'm, ah, what I'm doing I'm sure is having some benefit to the client. Fidelity means some faithful and, uhm, their might be difficult to see how a fidelity applies to whether I keep a record or not, uhm, that would apply more and say--t say you know, it's definitely keep records. Well, in that practice of fidelity I'm going to keep them a certain length of time and I'm going to keep them safe, ah, and so that nobody else has access to them and also protect the clients information. So my fidelity is to the client and that I do what I'm same going to do and that just because somebody says they want my record doesn't mean I'm just gonna turn it over. Okay. I'm and I'm very conservative in that area, I really fight very hard not to do that. Uhm, especially if I think it would be-- if it would be harmful or damaging to the client. And then the last principle justice and then has to do with, ah, access to service, the balance treatment of people and so on. So if you thinking in all of those, those areas and were just barely started in our process. 

00:12:55
THOM PANCELLA And when you talk to a lot more about process and content why are you focus more on process than content? 

00:13:00
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, I think that I focus more on process because when I have a process in place I can-- I can tackle anything it's kind like the, the idea, ah, similar idea to the saying, ah, if I-- if I give you a fish you have food for a day. If I teach you how to fish you have food for a lifetime. If I only talking about content I'm, I'm really limited to what ever that particular content is. If I have a process no matter what I'm face with I will be able to work my way through that process. 

00:13:35
THOM PANCELLA So what other considerations are into this process? 

00:13:40
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, the next level would that to loom at in the process of making this decision to whom am I responsible. And, ah, I think our first reaction is to say well, to the client and that's true it obviously do have a responsibility to the client. However, it doesn't stop there. If that were the only responsibility we probably wouldn't have so may difficulties. But for example I also have an obligation to an organization that I work for. Uhm, most organizations particularly those that work in the mental health field have some kind of accreditation they either accredited by the joint committee on healthcare organizations or the, the group that accredits rehabilitation facilities. And so those agencies have to meet certain criteria in, in doing that. And again to take the example of the record, ah, the organization has an expectation that the people who work to them are going to keep adequate and accurate records that's an obligation to the organization that's part of risk management. Ah, we really never know when a work with the client is going to end up in a direction that nobody intended it to do. And, ah, if there's no evidence of what's been done not only am I as an individual clinician in difficulty but the organization would be. They would have nothing to be able to, to present to show well this is what we did. ha, typically, uhm, ah, organizations, ah, would be face with this let say the client committed suicide or went out in harmed other people and they the family or, ah, you know, somebody else would turn back to the organization and someway you had this person in treatment. Ah, why didn't you do something? Well, the organization will be able to look at the re-- record or present and say what, what did-- but this is what we did. We did this and this and this, okay. Uhm, I also have an obligation to myself and, ah, so I also wanna be interested if you were-- just looking at the clinical record in terms of the risk management toward me. Ah, I wanna be able to show if my, uhm, ah, work was called into question. What I had actually done, uhm, and my efforts on behalf of a client. I also have an obligation to my family, uhm, that whatever I do with in my work with other people also doesn't lead to any harm to them. And I have an obligation to society. So all of these are also enter in to the process of ethical reasoning and were still not finished, okay. What comes next? Where, where we-- where we finally get to the professional Codes of Ethics? What are next? Okay. So at some point in this process I'm actually going to open up the Code of Ethics and begin and to look at it to see what does it have to say about this particular area. Ah, in addition to that I'm going to be looking at the state laws and regulations. Ah, we come in to, ah, this is probably a much more common area of, of, uhm, ethical dilemma is that-- and social workers are face with this I, uhm, I assumed that also substance abuse counselors are and they might end up in different places in this process it has to do with the whole area of reporting child abuse and neglect. That's an ethical dilemma because we-- and, and you can see in this process social workers are clearly mandated reporters of that. But supposed I have a client who said-- says to me if you make that phone call I'm never coming back and furthermore I'm taking my child with me, okay. So there are the, the person would be balancing all of those factors in coming to a reason, decision. And actually people might to a different decision about that, uhm, assuming risk on either side if I-- if I make the call I may risk the safety of the child because they a lot of, ah, therapy or treatment if I don't make the call I risk the safety of the child because now there's no third party intervening which could be helpful. And actually over the years we have found out that it, it's better there on the side of the safety of the child then whether or not the client stays in treatment. 

00:18:20
THOM PANCELLA Well, you mentioned, uhm, the NASW Code of Ethics, you mention Medic-- Meta-Ethical Principles the kind of cross Codes of Ethics, ah, and then you mention diving into them. What-- how many are there with? 

00:18:30
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, for every profession has their own Code of Ethics. And, ah, just to, to kind of give you an idea, uhm, in, in preparing for the workshop that I have done I take a look at them of course we have the National Association of Social Workers. Here in Missouri those of us who are certified, ah, substance abuse counselors when we get our renewal in the mail part of the packet is a Code of Ethics, ah, that we sign. Now, that Code of Ethics is very simple. It's 13 statement on an 81/2 by 11 page, and the, ha, bad code, uhm, says, you know, I subscribe to these things but it that, that still embody those same meta ethical principle that we just talk about. It just that is shorter and very brief. If we go back in any as NASW history there was a time when the NASW Code of Ethics look like that it was one-eight and a half by 11 sheet with about 12 or 13 statements on it. So generally the professions, ah, as the profession exist longer and longer the codes become more complex as they have more experience. So the clinical psychologist have a Code of Ethics, The American Counseling Association has a code. Uhm, and then there are some separate organizations for example the National Association or Black Social Workers has its own Code of Ethics. So there are-- there are many out there and when, ah, when you're-- if you're somebody like myself where I have, uhm, basically three Codes of Ethics that I've subscribe too, NASW Code of Ethics, the AAMFT Code of Ethics that from Marriage and Family Therapist and the Substance Abuse one. I would be looking at all three of those in my process of coming to a decision. And so how do I decide which one to follow. Well the rule of the damage you follow the one that's most strict. So I'm not I'm you know, that's, that's way to go. And, ah, a lot of times for me as a social worker as the NASW Code of Ethics that's the most strict. 

00:20:35
THOM PANCELLA Do you ever find that they're in conflict with one another? 

00:20:40
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Uhm, not, not particularly, uhm, at least that has not been my experience. I think things may be come more of a conflict for example, for substance abuse counselors and the, the Codes of Ethics because it has to do with the federal regulations that govern people and sub-- and treatment for substance abuse. And, uhm, I wish I've-- I'm not as well first at the as I-- as I would like to be but that's more likely were the conflict is to come because there are somethings they cannot be disclose otherwise it so discourages people from seeking treatment that, that they wouldn't that. Uhm, well let me give you an example it-- it's not necessarily a conflict but were the NASW Code of Ethics and the AAMFT Code of Ethics defer is, ah, in the area of, of having, ah, sexual contact with the a former client, okay. Uhm, the AAMFT Code of Ethics says-- said, uhm, I could after two, two years after the last treatment contact that I couldn't to enter sexual relationship with the client. The NASW Code of Ethics is been-- is silent on that the assumption being that you don't ever do that. And if you did even under the AAMFT Code of Ethics it's on-- it's on the therapist and to, ah, be able to articulate why that's not harmful to somebody. but in social work we take the, uhm, approach that if you-- if I you have been client and I been working with you for sometime in weekend. I wanted-- I want the door to be open so that you can come back in the future but if we get in to another kind of relationship then that's not going to be possible. 

00:22:30
THOM PANCELLA Well, early on you talked about the possibility of, of coming to different reason, conclusions giving the same set of facts. Uhm, how is that dealt with the professional level then if you're-- if you're face with, with having to, ah, if you face with kind of ethical charge. Ah, how is dealt with if you say, well I, I went through this process and here's the conclusion I came it but somebody else said, well this is the conclusion you should have come to. 

00:22:55
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, ah, basically what I'm responsible for is my process. Ah, you, you know I have to be able to articulate how I came to the conclusion that I came to even if somebody else disagree with it. Ah, whether or not that leads to legal liability that's a legal question. Uhm, but all the professions also have their own, uhm, a committees that deal with ethical complaints and that usually the first, ah, place where, ah, a complaint would be handle is at either the state level or the-- or the national level by, by the organization. And there I would wanna be able to articulate well, you know, this is what I did. Now, in a-- an important element of coming to a reason to decision, uhm, involves having a process you know, the words I can go through and I said, well I've, I've you know I look at kind of this intuitive aspects I look at the meta ethical principles. I look at the obligations, the code, the laws of the state and so forth and this is the conclusion I come to. But usually I would not find that enough what's important to me is to have consultation. I wanna be able to talk with somebody about what I'm thinking, ah, because very often getting my thoughts out there and hearing them out loud, ah, helps me to, to maybe reason this, ah, differently. And, ah, so and I like to have consultation be routine not, uhm, kind of catch us catch can. By routine I mean for example it might be on a weekly or every other week basis or a monthly basis. I can also turn to what I call decisions screens and, ah, and the workshop that I do that builds on this-- the first one that I did this year, ah, we get more into the use of such decisions screens and that those dealt more deeply usually into the values that people hold and, ah, how those values play out in terms of, ah, application of the Code of Ethics. And then they get this the opportunity for special consultation. Ah, NASW for example has an, ah, of a number you that the members can call and receive a consultation on ethics. So all those things go-- going together can help me to come to a reason decision. And, ah, I've have had abuse that over the years. 

00:25:30
THOM PANCELLA You, you can touch then what, what those I gonna asking that was about resources for people who have, have questions about, about this decisions. What about after a decision is made if somebody here is, is kind of back tracking and saying, well I've, I've made a decision I've, I've implementing something but now I'm not sure if I did the right thing. 

00:25:45
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, uhm, I actually have had that happen where I, I did something that thought later about it and you know, and I was-- I was very confident on what I done but then decided they probably wasn't such a good idea. But I couldn't do anything about what I had already done. What I could is learn from that experience and that repeat that in the future and, uhm, also not repeat whatever that was with the a particular client. This involve, ah, something cross culturally and also a relationship that involve, uhm, somebody that I knew with another contacts. But based on the consultation that I did it seem like a good idea, ah, to respect the persons culture which is another part of the Code of Ethics is the whole area of cultural competence at least for social workers. And, ah, the choice there are seem to be between, ah, uhm, this person going to receive service at all. Ah, or in other words no service or service delivery by somebody that the person you in trust it. But later on thinking about that and also then looking at the state regulations, ah, which specifically prohibit those kinds of dual relationships. Ah, when the, ah, person ask me again in the future about doing that I declined and explain, uhm, the ethics behind it and why that would not be a good idea. 

00:27:15
THOM PANCELLA Other, ah, other resources that, that people can get and help with? 

00:27:20
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Ah, sure on if well, if course at first op-- first of all, it helps to be a member of your professional organization because if you're not a member you gonna floating out there. And, ah, you do not have access to the resources for example, calling the state office of any NASW here in Missouri or the national-- the national offices of as an 800 number and at certain hours and you can also visit the website but if you're not a member you, you can't, ah, you don't have access to that. So I very much encourage people to become members of their professional organizations not only for that reason that you have the resources for consultation. But the Codes of Ethics are not static documents. They are living documents and if I'm not a member of the of my professional organization I don't have any say in what goes into that Code of Ethics. And they change periodically, uhm, that there were some amendments made just this year to the NASW Code of Ethics in the areas of, ah, discrimination. Ah, I happened to look at the American Counseling Associations Code of Ethics and the most recent one was adopted in 2005, it had a lot to say in there about the use of the elect-- of the modern means of communication. Uhm, email electronic communications those kinds of things. So, uhm, it's true the professional organization that the Code of Ethics are revive and adopted to meet the changing circumstances. Ah, they reflect the different thinking that people might have. Uhm, so those are some of the things that are, are resources out there but in order to access them they have to be a member. 

00:29:10
THOM PANCELLA Do you have any final thoughts that you like to share with our, with our audience? 

00:29:15
PEGGY KEILHOLZ Well, I hope that people will find ethics, ah, intriguing and interesting rather than frightening. See whether or not I ever read a Code of Ethics or engaged in any ethical process, any ethical reasoning process I'm practicing according to some ethic. I just haven't articulated it. And, ah, that 's a dangerous place to be, uhm, one of the, uhm, ah, an author writing for the Marriage and Family Therapist, uhm, put together while he call it ethics at risk test. And one of the first, first question is have you ever had a course in ethics. Particularly as it relates to your profession. If you haven't you already at risk. Ah, and I, I know that from the workshops that I've done that, ah, sometimes people will say, that if they got nothing else out of the workshop they've learned that they need to read the Code of Ethics at least once a year and I'm delighted if that's what they got out of it. Them, ah, then I'm, I'm very please, ah, because of that's the first place you have to start if you don't know what it says. How can you practice ethically?
