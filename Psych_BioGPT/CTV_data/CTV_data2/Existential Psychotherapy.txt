THE EVOLUTION OF PSYCHOTHERAPY A CONFERENCE DECEMBER 11-15, 1985 Phoenix, Arizona COPYRIGHT 1985 

00:00:05
DUE TO THE HIGHLY TECHNICAL NATURE OF THE MATERIAL AND IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE SUBJECTS, THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE SHOWN ONLY TO PROFESSIONALS CONSISTING OF: PHYSICIANS, DENTISTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS, MASTERS LEVEL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, OR GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ACCREDITED PROGRAMS IN THE ABOVE FIELDS. 

00:00:05
The following clinical presentation was videotaped at Phoenix Civic Plaza on Friday, Dec. 13, 1985. 

00:00:05
Existential psychotherapy Speaker RONALD D. LAING, M.D. 

00:00:50
BILL MCCLOUD Well welcome ladies and gentlmen, my name's Bill McCloud, and this afternoon I'm going to introduce two people to you. The first is of course Dr. Ronald Laing, who will need no introduction to you, although perhaps a personal reminiscence that in 1955 while I was a philosophy student, I read Dr. Laing's The Divided Self and was so inspired that I went into medicine in order to do psychiatry. So that you've had a very profound influence in my life, sir. Uh, Dr. Laing has agreed to interview someone, and uh, we have somebody who is very graciously, or two people who have very graciously agreed to be interviewed and they will be seen in a small room in the back of this, uh, building behind that is in order to preserve their uh, confidentiality. And, uh, on my left is Miss Lenn Leebling, a social worker at the Mericoba (ph) medical center, and the medical center is known as the Medical Center counting homeless alternative psychiatric services center, known as CHAPS for short. And, in the English-speaking world, of course, CHAPS means something quite different than what it means to you. So we're going to be seeing at least one chap, and one lady I think when Dr. Lang leaves the stage in a moment, and Miss Leebling will, uh, leave a brief resume of the presentation in order to put it into context so that it is not completely out of the blue for you. So Dr. Laing, would you like to go now, or would you have Miss Leebling speak first. 

00:02:30
DR. LAING I, Miss Leebling, or, uh, will say a few words while I'll leave the stage and uh join the company in the uh, room back there. Um, follow part of the plan is that, uh, this interview will go on until about 20 to two or um, quarter to two, about half an hour, and then I'll come back and I'll be joined by uh, uh, Michael and Randy who are sitting here whom Lenn will introduce to you. Um, and the forward person will then, uh, take questions. Uh, I've met the lady, uh, whom I'll be talking with, uh, for about 10 minutes. I met uh, uh, last night for the first time, we just said hello and she agreed to uh, do this. I met her uh, for a few minutes. Just know, um, from the center to here, so uh, we've had no, uh, conversation at all about her life, about herself about her situation. And, um, it, it's entirely by ear what you'll be seeing happening. 

00:04:00
MISS LEEBLING I didn't know I was going to do this until 10 minutes ago. Um, so, let me just lay out that CHAPS is a program which the county has set up for the homeless who have been labelled mentally ill. I work in the county psychiatric annex which is the voluntary and involuntary treatment facility. At one point, um, it was noticed that certain people, that, the major treatment there is through drugs and chemicals. Um, it was noticed that some people didn't wanna take this kind of treatment and were labelled treatment resistant. In order to seduce them into the um, into the scheme of things, a um, treatment resistant facility was set up near St. Vincent Paul which is downtown near where the homeless people are. And, um, case managers and doctors um, stay there and give help for people that want it, um, and help facilitate them, kind of negotiate uh, through their life and the city of Phoenix. Uh, the two people that are going to be interviewed by Dr. Laing are people that um, are involved in the CHAPS program, and um, you know are sometimes homeless, and are quote treatment resistant. And that's all I have to say. 

00:05:25
BILL MCCLOUD Thank you, at 20 to two, uh, I would like to introduce them now, if you'd stand up and then come up to the stage later on. Dr. Michael Stumph (ph), and Mr. Randy Park (ph), the case manager from the hospital who'll be joining us, as I said at 20 to two. So thank you both for being here. So, should we start? 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:05:50
LELA They can't hear me. 

00:05:50
DR. LAING I can hear you now. Yes. 

00:05:55
LELA Says, says, when you, when you try to torture him, he's gonna get a parachute and bail out. 

00:06:05
DR. LAING Mhmm, mhmm, to the nether regions. 

00:06:05
LELA Huh? 

00:06:05
DR. LAING To the upper regions. 

00:06:05
LELA What? 

00:06:05
DR. LAING To the nether or upper regions. Anyway, Lela, uh, I don't know anything about you at all. Uh, and I don't know what, uh, to ask you about yourself. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:40
DR. LAING What do, what would you feel that, uh, appropriate to say under the circumstances. 

00:06:50
LELA I don't know. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:07:00
DR. LAING Is there anything that, uh, do you feel that your situation is okay for you just now, or, uh, you're say-, you tell me coming over here, taking some noxvimica (ph) to calm your system down- 

00:07:20
LELA And to sharpen my stupid wits. 

00:07:20
DR. LAING Now, what is it, what is it so, creating there. Stat it in your system, sup it in your system. 

00:07:30
LELA Oh, um, I think my brain doesn't work right. 

00:07:35
DR. LAING In what way? 

00:07:40
LELA Oh, let me see, well I guess, I get, the nexvomica doesn't treat this per say, I'm gettin' another remedy for that, well, I get things turned around, I get opposites confused. I get my, when I write I get my letters confused, I get words confused. The end. Uh, either I tend to be paranoid, or they really are after me, I don't know which. 

00:08:10
DR. LAING So you're not sure whether you're confused about that or not. 

00:08:15
LELA About what? 

00:08:15
DR. LAING About whether they really are after you or not. 

00:08:20
LELA Well he sounds like it. 

00:08:20
DR. LAING What, him? 

00:08:20
LELA Oh, yeah. 

00:08:25
DR. LAING You might be after me for all I know. 

00:08:30
LELA Oh, I'm just trying to help you guys and get some sense into your brains, I don't know if it's worth it though. You know, I, I had a guru for a long time, who said, there isn't any sense in it, what you gotta do to be able to perceive reality is attain a level of consciousness which he offered which I never obtained which is he said, beyond the mind. It's completely above the mind. 

00:09:00
DR. LAING What sort of guru is this coaching? 

00:09:05
LELA This is guru Moharty (ph). 

00:09:05
DR. LAING Oh, well what do you take him to mean by that? Beyond the mind or above the mind. 

00:09:15
LELA Well, whatever it is, I couldn't imagine with my mind, because it's beyond the mind. Or I suppose it's some sort of I suppose it involves a universe-, or being conscious of the universe or consciousness. You know everybody is subconsciously aware of um, everybody else's mind. Well, you know that, I've seen that, I've seen you read my mind. 

00:09:45
DR. LAING I don't see how you can be conscious of the universal mind, the universal mind's conscious of you, but you're not conscious of it. 

00:09:55
LELA Yeah, maybe out of my bitterness I just say well the universal mind, you know, doesn't know anything. And maybe I say that because, because, uh, I look around and I don't see, I don't see any superior intelligence taking care of anything. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
DR. LAING How would you expect to see a, you mean all the pain and suffering, stupidity and confusion in the world, how can there be any universal mind of, our universal mind allows that stuff to go on. 

00:10:35
LELA Yeah, especially stupidity. 

00:10:35
DR. LAING Ah. So either the, maybe the, either the universal mind is, uh, stupid itself, or it's mad itself, or it doesn't exist. 

00:10:50
LELA Oh, it exists. In my opinion, it's the sum total of the human minds, but it, it exists. 

00:11:00
DR. LAING well are you trying to well I mean I've spent a long time trying to work out uh, how that can, uh, be the case if it is the case. But I haven't found any answer to that. Myself. But I, I still put a coat and tie on under the circumstances. Why not, you know? 

00:11:30
LELA Yeah, I asked him why he didn't kill himself and he says he's not ready yet. 

00:11:35
DR. LAING Mmhmm. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:45
LELA Well I guess if you're dead, you blow any chance of me, um, doing anything good, huh? 

00:11:55
DR. LAING This time 'round. 

00:11:55
LELA Huh? 

00:11:55
DR. LAING This time round anyway. 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:15
DR. LAING If we were just sitting here without these, uh, cameras on us, and these microphones, I wouldn't say anything just now, but uh, I feel compelled to uh, make an effort to keep talking for the sake of, uh, people who are listening to them. Maybe I shouldn't bother. 

00:12:40
LELA Are people listening to this? 

00:12:40
DR. LAING Yeah, a lot of people listening, that's why the, you know. 

00:12:45
LELA Nobody told me that the cameras was on. 

00:12:55
DR. LAING The cameras, uh, that guy's got the-, as far as I know he's got the camera uh, on just now. And there are a whole lot of people listening to it. 

00:13:05
LELA Because I, when I talked about that stuff I didn't know the camera was on. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
DR. LAING How long have you been in phoenix, then? 

00:13:20
LELA Year and a half. 

00:13:25
DR. LAING And what brought you to Phoenix? 

00:13:25
LELA I was trying to escape the conspiracy, and it didn't work. 

00:13:30
DR. LAING And, what conspiracy? 

00:13:30
LELA Well, if there is one, I suppose you're a conspirator so you know already. If there isn't, I guess I just imagined it. 

00:13:40
DR. LAING Well, uh, whether or not I'm a conspirator, and whether or not you're imagining it, are you prepared to, uh, uh, uh, give me your account of what that conspiracy is? 

00:14:00
LELA As much as I can figure out, yeah. 

00:14:05
DR. LAING Oh, go ahead. 

00:14:05
LELA Yeah, well, I think the conspiracy doesn't exist so I just don't think about it. If I don't think about it, it's not there too much. But then people like Peter, people like Doctor Stumph, that, you know, they tend to make me believe in it again. So. So I try to avoid those people. I'm not gonna talk to you anymore. No he's all right, but that's part of the job. 

00:14:30
DR. LAING Is it a benign conspiracy or a malign conspiracy? Is it a conspiracy for good or for evil? 

00:14:40
LELA Heck if I know, but if anybody messes with me like that I don't care, but you know what I figure is um, you see the mind creates a whole lotta things, I mean, I see mine as really powerful and people subconciously their minds always interract. They do, I've seen it. You know. And, um, people see what they expect to see. So it stands to reason, if I believe in a conspiracy people are gonna act like conspirators. 

00:15:20
DR. LAING Well, so far, okay. 

00:15:30
LELA Yeah, but I told Dr. Stumph he walked in to the room just as I was saying something negative about doctors, but he denied that he heard it. 

00:15:45
DR. LAING Well who walked in the room, Peter? 

00:15:50
LELA Huh? 

00:15:50
DR. LAING Who walked in the room just as when you were saying something- 

00:15:50
LELA Doctor Stumph. 

00:15:55
DR. LAING Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:16:00
LELA But I don't know maybe I expected him to walk in when I say something negative about doctors. I mean they try. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
DR. LAING Well that's, a thing happens. Is happening all the time, I mean I do, I don't see what, you make it a special point of that, but. 

00:16:25
LELA What do you mean? 

00:16:30
DR. LAING I don't see why you are making a special point of telling me that, uh, at just now since that sort of thing, as you know I know, and I know you know happens all the time anyway. 

00:16:45
LELA Yeah. Okay, it's cuz they're watching us. 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:17:05
DR. LAING Well I mean this whole set up is an enormous conspiracy, and you're right in the heart of the conspiracy just now. So it's, you haven't if you, if you came to Phoenix to get away from the conspiracy, you haven't done very well. 

00:17:30
LELA What do you mean? 

00:17:30
DR. LAING Well you're sitting here in this situation. 

00:17:35
LELA You mean the conference is a conspiracy? 

00:17:35
DR. LAING Yeah. Of course. 

00:17:40
LELA What kind of a conspiracy. 

00:17:45
DR. LAING Uh, well I've got, uh, I've got a plane booked to get to Boston Sunday so I'm not gonna see what the conspiracy is, because I wanna go on that plane, and get on it, as far as I'm concerned. No, I think it's quite a benign conspiracy. It's certainly a very concerted deep plan involves, uh, as much wider and number of people are actually here 7,000 people have flown in, and that's, sort of minor conspiracy in terms of the galaxy, but it's quite a big conspiracy. 

00:18:30
LELA Well, you know about it. What do you know about it? 

00:18:35
DR. LAING Well, I think it's, uh, uh, I think the universal mind is, uh, has been a sweet puppet, and as far as this planet goes, I mean in this galaxy, the, the, that, uh, and this planet, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's itching a bit. And it sort of waking up a bit, gonna do something about it- 

00:19:10
LELA It is capable of doing anything? 

00:19:10
DR. LAING Uh huh. Uh huh. Well Jesus Christ has no other hands but ours. 

00:19:20
LELA Oh. 

00:19:20
DR. LAING It's only capable of doing what we do. I mean, as far as we're concerned. 

00:19:30
LELA Are you a Christian? 

00:19:35
DR. LAING Well that depends who I'm talking to. 

00:19:35
LELA Well just tell me- 

00:19:35
DR. LAING Oh, if I'm talking to you. Well, uh, I'm not sure what there is to say about that, uh, I'm a Christian in the sense that Jesus Christ wasn't crucified, isn't, wasn't crucified between two candle sticks in a Cathedral, he was crucified in the town garbage heap, between two theives, and in that sense I'm a Christian. 

00:20:00
LELA You're what? I didn't hear the last word. 

00:20:05
DR. LAING In that sense, I'm a Christian. But I mean in another sense, I, I wouldn't admit to being a Christian in most Christian company. Are you a Christian? 

00:20:25
LELA Hell no. 

00:20:25
DR. LAING Hm? Hm? 

00:20:30
LELA I don't think so, uh, I think, I think God doesn't know what he's doing. So, who knows, maybe Jesus, maybe Jesus had a mental problem. You know. 

00:20:45
DR. LAING Well I, maybe he didn't have tim to mature. They got him too young. 

00:20:55
LELA Or maybe, I was talking to my friend about this other day, I told him I don't believe in God, he says, he believes in many Gods, and, and, they eat their disciples after they die. So maybe that's what Jesus does. 

00:21:20
DR. LAING Well, uh, uh, worse things could happen, and uh, if when I die, I was eaten up by Jesus, sounds quite gospel of him- 

00:21:35
LELA Everything would be okay? Well I thought it might be better than getting eaten by the devil. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
DR. LAING It might be, indeed. 

00:21:55
LELA But then, it might be better not to get eaten at all. 

00:21:55
DR. LAING I don't think you can help it. 

00:22:00
LELA Excuse me? 

00:22:00
DR. LAING I don't think you can help it, I mean, we're either, uh, we're either in the boughs of hell or uh, the boughs of heaven the boughs at one time- 

00:22:10
LELA The what? 

00:22:15
DR. LAING The bowels. 

00:22:15
LELA The bowels. Oh, yeah. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:30
LELA But I think that's awfully mean. But then, that's just what my friend said. It doesn't mean it's true. 

00:22:35
DR. LAING Do you think it's not fair? You say it's awfully mean. 

00:22:45
LELA I think it's awfully mean that humans are at the consciousness we're at. We're just half, just halfway someplace. We're intelligent, we're not intelligent enough. At least I haven't figured anything out. Have you, you're older? 

00:23:15
DR. LAING What difference does that make? 

00:23:15
LELA Well you've had more time, have you figured anything out? 

00:23:20
DR. LAING You don't get any wiser when you get older. 

00:23:20
LELA See? 

00:23:25
DR. LAING Well, that got a laugh. 

00:23:30
[sil.] 

00:23:45
DR. LAING What about your, um, mom and dad and that sort of thing. What sort of, are they alive, or- 

00:23:55
LELA Who, my parents? Yeah. 

00:24:00
DR. LAING What sort of chap was your father? 

00:24:05
LELA Oh, he's a Christian preacher. Yes. 

00:24:10
DR. LAING Oh yeah, no I don't know him. 

00:24:10
LELA Yeah, my parents are very religious. At least they say they are. 

00:24:15
DR. LAING Well you're very religious. 

00:24:20
LELA Well, I, yeah I guess I am- 

00:24:20
DR. LAING Well it's not meant as an insult. 

00:24:25
LELA And my parents run, currently are running a shelter in Michigan. 

00:24:30
DR. LAING What? 

00:24:30
LELA They are running a shelter. 

00:24:30
DR. LAING Oh yeah, huh. 

00:24:35
LELA Yes. 

00:24:40
DR. LAING Where exactly? 

00:24:40
LELA Saganall (ph). 

00:24:45
DR. LAING How do they feel about you? 

00:24:50
LELA I don't know. I don't know, um, I wrote them, I don't know I wrote'em a letter and asked 'em and I haven't picked it up in the mail yet. I asked them uh, if, if it was okay for me to send a Christmas present. That's, I don't know. 

00:25:15
DR. LAING No reply? 

00:25:15
LELA I haven't been to the post office yet. To pick it up. If they did reply. I mean, they probably did. 

00:25:30
DR. LAING Do you expect them to send you a Christmas present? 

00:25:35
LELA I don't know. But see I was, I had some Christmas gifts, so I thought I'd send'em some, because I was making crafts for Christmas. 

00:25:45
DR. LAING Because you were making... 

00:25:50
LELA Crafts. 

00:25:50
DR. LAING Crafts. 

00:25:50
LELA Yeah. 

00:25:50
DR. LAING Oh. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:00
DR. LAING I would never have thought of, uh, sending writing my parents and asking them if it was okay for me to send them a present for Christmas. I mean, why wouldn't it be okay? 

00:26:15
LELA Oh, because maybe they hate me after all I, after being an unfaithful daughter. 

00:26:25
DR. LAING Unfaithful too... 

00:26:30
LELA I haven't visited them in years. And in fact, and I don't communicate well with them either. But you see I have my own life to live. Uh, you know, I hope they understand that, but, maybe they don't. 

00:26:50
DR. LAING Well if you're faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ, how can you be unfaithful to your father? Well he said that, didn't he, unless you hate your father and father and mother and follow me you can't be a disciple. What does your father make of that? 

00:27:10
LELA Well, probably that um, all this Christain emphasis on family is uh, is uh, is against the teachings of Jesus. You know the modern Christian emphasis on family. 

00:27:35
DR. LAING I mean, I don't, I, do you know that passage, where Jesus, uh, I always say, thought that there was something wrong with that translation, when it said unless you uh, the I, unless you hate your father and mother, brothers and sisters also, it says, you cannot be my disciple. In the English version. I think it means unless you prefer me to your father and mother. 

00:28:05
LELA I don't recall that he said, said hate. It's, uh, it something like deny. 

00:28:10
DR. LAING I asked a guy if I remembered, but he said he thought it meant unless you were happily indifferent to them. 

00:28:20
LELA Oh, that makes a lotta sense. 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
LELA Because if you're not happily indifferent to your parents, they're gonna be on your case all your life. 

00:28:40
DR. LAING That's right. I have to go back now. I have to get up on stage and talk about this, all right. 

00:28:50
LELA Okay. 

00:28:55
DR. LAING I'll see you later. 

00:28:55
LELA Hey can I come out? 

00:29:00
DR. LAING Do you wanna come out? 

00:29:00
LELA See what you say, yeah. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:20
BILL MCCLOUD Perhaps I could ask if any of the panel would like to make a comment before we go for questions and answers from the, and comments from the audience. 

00:29:35
BILL MCCLOUD How is that for you now that you've seen that there is a large group of people here? Thank you for your graciousness in being here by the way. 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
LELA They're very nice to clap. 

00:29:55
BILL MCCLOUD It's an acknowledgement of your courage. Thank you. 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:05
BILL MCCLOUD Right, so we'll take questions from the, from the audience, uh, if anybody would like to come up and address a question to a member of the panel. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:25
BILL MCCLOUD Yes, he has a question here, thank you. 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN Well I'm only getting up because no one else did, and I wanna tell you that my impression was that our young lady is extremely bright, and I'd like you to know from my point of view that one of the reasons that I'm at this conference is to answer some of the questions about life you're looking at through your eyes. And, uh, appreciate you being up there. 

00:30:55
BILL MCCLOUD Thank you. Yes? 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN Yes, I was wondering what you thought really went on therapeutically in that, uh, interview? 

00:31:05
BILL MCCLOUD You're addressing that to Dr. Laing? 

00:31:10
DR. LAING What do you think went on therapeautically? 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN I'm, I'm mystified to tell you the truth. So maybe you could explain it to me. 

00:31:20
DR. LAING If you're mystified I can't explain it to you. 

00:31:30
[sil.] 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN Did anything go on? 

00:31:40
BILL MCCLOUD There's an observation perhaps you could make as to who's up on the platform which might partly answer your question. 

00:31:50
[sil.] 

00:31:55
BILL MCCLOUD Yes? 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Um, a couple of days ago, Dr. Laing uh, you spoke about creating a kind of transpersonal reality, uh, not creating but stepping into something that is a shared reality between you and the person you're working with. And that spoke to that very deeply. Um, and I was really interested in in hearing from the young woman that you've been interviewing with, and also from you, about the experience of that, moving into that place. Um, you, and I'm speaking to the young woman, mentioned uh, some feeling of Dr. Laing having read your mind earlier? And it, I'd like to hear anything you have to say about that experience. Either something, uh, his stepping into your, your head, or the two of you being in some kind of shared reality. 

00:32:55
[sil.] 

00:33:10
DR. LAING Neither of us now how to answer that question. 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:20
DR. LAING But, uh, uh, all of us, sort of put in a few words, uh, uh, to this, and, um, tell me if I'm straight or not. Uh, it-, it's with the greatest uh, reservations that uh, I think one can talk about transpersonal reality. It is certainly non-verbal and it is uh, fundamental, essentially, impossible, to express in the content of words. It is possible to convey it however, more in the through words. Through the, in the music of words. In the manner of words. And in the other ways in which I was trying to explain two days ago when you communicate with someone interpersonally. Uh, if that realization uh, is present, of the transpersonal field, then nothing needs to be said, uh, between those people who are aware of that transpersonal field. When one tries to explain one's awareness of that transpersonal field to people who are not aware of it, and I know that in this company, there are a lot of you who are aware of it, and many of you who are not aware of it. And to those of you who are aware of it, you know how difficult it is to talk about, and to those of, those of you who are not aware of it, I would say this. Don't be too impatient. Don't, because you don't understand it. Because you are mystified. Don't get angry, something is happening. Something is happening. Something is happening between us in this hall at this very moment. We can't express it in words. There is a conspiracy. There is a divine conspiracy. Which has brought us together. There is a divine conspiracy as well as a conspiracy of the devil. Uh, I'm not going to go on and, uh, ask any more about that certain part, uh, it, as I was trying to say before, it makes all the difference if there is a, if there is a sense of communion, which is unspoken, it doesn't have to be said, it shouldn't have to be spoken about any more than it sometimes needs to be, out of which interpersonal communication occurs and which links up with the intrapersonal. If that is there, it makes all the difference. If that is absolute, it sort of going at it like this, making interpretations, trying to understand, trying to do psychotherapy whether it's behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, psychoanalytic therapy, or whatnot ecetera, it will come to nothing, it is all, it doesn't get any better with those people, those people who are find it very difficult to live in the world of the interpersonal, and the intrapersonal and can see how stupid it all is, how ugly it all is, how inexpressibly confused it all is. And yet, um, uh, I just regard regard it as crazy and mad for realizing that. They're either locked up or run away. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Speaking about conspiracy, I'd like to ask the members of the panel how this young woman came to be interviewed in front of hundreds or thousands of us today without knowing that this was the case. 

00:38:45
DR. LAING She knew it was the case, she didn't know that we, that the camera had started running. Oh she knew absolutely, right? You knew it was the case. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN You knew we were watching. 

00:39:05
LELA I didn't know when they started the cameras. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN I got it. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN It seems to me that what seems to be happening is that a vaccuum as been created. It reminds me of a professor friend of mine who said I feel, I feel, I don't know what I feel, but oh how I feel. And, what I'm wondering is that vaccuum allows people in the medical professions to bring zombies to us, and we have to work with them, and uh, the vacuum doesn't really give to me at least a feeling of understanding and when you refuse to understand, refuse, it sounds sort of near vanished, and although I'm not against that, I think that some kind of clearer explanation, clearer understanding should be given so we know what we're doing. And when you avoid those things you're breaking down the whole therapeautic process it would seem to me. Enlightenment does not come just by remaining silent, although that's a nice feeling. 

00:40:05
DR. LAING This, uh, young lady sitting beside me is supposed to be a absolute paranoid schizophrenic, on many cases. She's sitting here just now, perfectly compus mentus (ph), perfectly clear, facing this most intimidating situation from the stage, not exhibiting any symptoms of schizophrenic, uh, uh, disorder, if you knew of any medication that could do that in 20 minutes, from there to here, would you say you wouldn't give that to a patient? You'd have to spend the rest of your life being a biochemist to understand what the chemical effects of that sort of thing's supposed to be in the center of the nervous system. So you don't know anything about this sort of process, have the humility to admit that, and keep your place instead of the arrogance that you seem to have to think that you have because you don't know something that, eh, uh, that there's something the matter with those people who do. 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN I didn't say that I don't-, I have a mind that can understand I'm sure you do, uh, and I don't think we should call each other's names and say arrogance, I think there is more arrogance in silence sometimes than there is in expressing wisdom, if somebody has it. If there is wisdom, give it to us, but, uh, don't let us feel as though there's some kind of a mystical communion going on when there isn't. 

00:42:05
DR. LAING There is, there is, that's the point. But you say, some sort of mystical communion going on when there isn't. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Well again it's, I feel, I feel I don't know- 

00:42:25
DR. LAING You don't know and I'm saying it's not verbal. And it can't be put into words. And because you can't understand it, obviously, there is some sort of mystical communion going on- 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN But there are people who have claimed to see the devil, there have people who have claimed to all kinds of things. If it bothers you, I can quit. 

00:42:50
DR. LAING It bothers me! 

00:42:55
BILL MCCLOUD Thank you. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. Since we have the doctors on the panel up there I wonder if they would be willing to take this opportunity to talk about their own struggles with medicating the folks at CHAPS. I was over there last night and met them and I'm sure that they do struggle with this and those of us who work in a system struggle very much with the issue of medication particularly around relief of pain as opposed to control of behavior, I'd just like to hear the doctors and other members of the panel address that directly. 

00:43:30
BILL MCCLOUD Dr. Stumph? 

00:43:30
DR STUMPH Thank you. That has been quite an issue within our program. Briefly, our program, CHAPS, County Homeless Alternative Psychiatric Services is a storefront bowery area clinic, um, we're down there in between the, uh, the homeless shelter, the euphemistically labeled open-air park, and the plasma center. Our mandate, or what we're paid to do is to locate homeless people who have been diagnosed chronically mentally ill and of course those that pay us have a strict set of criterias to what's being considered chronically mentally ill and what is not. We're a voluntary program, and essentially we're a place for people to come when they have no where else to go. People are welcome to show up, have a sandwhich, have a cup of coffee, watch the television, talk with people. One of our first goals is to find folks a decent place to live. Make sure they have somwhere they can get their three squre meals a day. And address other concrete concerns ongoing medical problems that need to be treated. Oftentimes we find just by removing people from the street environment, and placing them somewhere stable, or helping them find somwhere stable to live, we see tremendous gains in terms of reduction of psychosis, um, diminishing of symptoms, and people just generall get along much better. Um, for example, Lela, when I had first seen her, you mind me saying? Was back in this summer I saw her twice at the CHAPS center, where she had come in, um, I really can't say why the motivation, I imagine she had heard about us, some from other people around, is that right? How come you came to CHAPS Lela? The first time? You heard about us? You were referred. Oh, one of the guys at the shelter had saw her and said she might wanna drop by. Um, we saw her once or twice, sat and talked, um, and I didn't see her again until last night when she fortuitously showed up. Um, I would posit since when I saw Lela in the summer, and she was doing quite poorly by my criteria, and that she exhibited loose associations, prominent delusions, um, was visibly hallucinating, and was disoriented, um, and now of course she's much better, but I would posit that a great deal of that gain is not due so much to any other factor than that she now has a stable place to live. I think one of the national shames within our society is that right here within our city while we're sitting comfortably, there are over a thousand mentally ill persons who slept last night on the streets. 

00:46:20
BILL MCCLOUD You can't see it Michael, but there's disagreement from this end of the table. 

00:46:25
LELA No, that's not why I'm doing better. I explained it, I explained it last night if you remember- 

00:46:30
DR STUMPH I do. Would you liketo tell them? 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:40
LELA The reason I'm doin' better is because I quit puttin' mental energy into the, into uh, the conspiracy. And creating it to a certain point. But this guy says that there is one. And, what I was trying-, and I think that's because, you know how to share mind? It's because he knows how to... 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:20
LELA It's because he knows how to tap into a lotta people's minds. You know, on a subtle level, not by just asking question, because everybody reads minds, you guys read minds, I can tell ya, everybody does. And if you observe, if you look around, you'll notice it. 

00:47:45
[sil.] 

00:47:50
LELA And I'd like to say something else while I got this. I don't go around like a paranoid schizophrenic all the time. I know how to keep my cool, and, and I think there's gotta be a great psychotherapist because, um, because he does that, because he knows how to tap into, into other people's, where other people's minds are at. And I'm not by just asking questions and trying to figure things out like, um, some. 

00:48:30
[sil.] 

00:48:35
BILL MCCLOUD Thank you, yes? We have time for, uh, few more questions, yes. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Okay, just briefly, I'm having a real difficult time reading the doctor's mind at this point. I still don't feel that he addressed the issue of medication. 

00:48:45
DR STUMPH You're probably right, I didn't quite far enough. I do utilize medicines. Um, again, we're a voluntary program. I believe that a modern day psychiatrist has to be well versed in all types of therapies, including medical therapies, analytical therapies, other dynamic therapies, and lastly social therapies to do only one type of therapy for all types of patients is inappropriate. Some patients benefit from from one approach, other patients benefit from another approach. When I feel patients can benefit from some sort of medication for symptom reduction, then I certainly offer it, we're a voluntary program, nobody takes anything that they don't wanna take. But I do use medicines quite extensively. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN What I was told is that they are, they are very strongly encouraged to take medication. That's what I was told by the social worker at CHAPS, that that is a, agenda of the program. 

00:49:45
DR STUMPH Um, at times, yeah, we don't twist peoples arms and threaten to throw them out in the street, we provide services to folks whether or not they take medicines. In general, the folks I see, they've been called chronic, generally they're going to have some sort of symptoms life-long. I'm much more concerned that they come away with a good experience with their psychiatrists, and grow to trust psychiatrists a bit more and be able to turn to us when they need to then I am in momentarily reducing symptoms with medication. However medications can be literally life-saving when appropriately used. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Thank you, I just wondered if theres anyone else on the panel who'd like to add to that and I'm gonna sit down. 

00:50:25
BILL MCCLOUD Good, thank you. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Uh, this is on the lighter side, and it's for Dr. Laing- 

00:50:30
BILL MCCLOUD Could you speak a little louder please, thank you. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN This is for Dr. Laing, and his friend on his left. Um, on Tuesday, I didn't get an opportunity to ask him and I have a big need to ask him, if he is indeed conversant with the novelist Doris Lessing (ph), I'm a fan of hers and a fan of his. I didn't get a chance to ask that question. Today, along comes this young woman who has a remarkable resemblance to Doris Lessing, physically, I see, and uh, I just wanna say that I see that as sort of a synchronistic event. But it is still a question. Did you hear me? 

00:51:15
DR. LAING Yes, um, uh, I, I've met Doris Lessing, yes. Uh, and uh, I've read, uh, some of Doris Lessing's uh, work, and I very much, uh, I very much, uh, have got her very much admire, as a writer, uh, and uh, like her as a person. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN I felt particularly in The Four-Gated City she was influenced by your work. If you remember that book. 

00:51:40
DR. LAING Oh, I think she has been, she certainly has said so, and in writing, yes. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:51:50
BILL MCCLOUD Yes. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Yes, my question goes to uh, Dr. Laing and uh, the young lady. Uh, I would like you to tell me all the people here at the same time, that how is it for you, young lady, I don't know your name, how is it for you to be here, there with us, now? And for Dr. Laing, uh, what does that mean to you? 

00:52:25
LELA Well, well, I hope you guys can learn something. 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:40
BILL MCCLOUD That says it all, thank you. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Okay, I loved it, I thought it was wonderful, and I think that, uh, you should learn something from Ronald, because I don't think you did. You see, what we have experienced here is a communion of love. Uh, what I was observing, and I felt, in terms, I fell in love with this young person. And she was able to release it from Ronald and showed it here from her that kind of experiences. It was experienced at the level not of the world, but there was an element of joining that was expressed in their hands, in their legs, they were moving exactly in the same place, and I loved it. And I think it's important then that you should know that. I am talking to the physician that talked about drugs, because the drug that existed there is very, very powerful. 

00:53:55
BILL MCCLOUD Thank you Dr. Minutian. Point of information. Uh, one more question, and then we leave it at then. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN May I ask, a point of information, and I think only the young lady can answer this. You've been introduced as one of the homeless, and you undoubtedly have met many others on the street. How many of you, and I mean, I don't know if it's fair for me to ask you to speak for others, but how many of you would choose to stay where you are, if people would leave you alone? 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN I, I, I'm asking this because it's somehow disturbing to many others to see somebody without a place. So, they want to make a place for them. And what's more they want to make a place for them for homeless people altogether. You know, bunched. And I wonder if that's a good thing. 

00:55:05
LELA The worst thing about being on the streets is feeling threatened by other people, who try to do harm to the street people. And it doesn't help, it doesn't help a person feel, um, less like people are out to get 'em either, you know. 

00:55:25
BILL MCCLOUD Thank you. 

00:55:30
DR STUMPH May I answer that question please, before we sign off? I'd like to, because it brings in with the last question about the power of love. I have yet to meet any of our clients on the street that enjoy being there. They're there because circumstances have forced them there. It is quite dangerous, it's quite uncomfortable. No one wants to be there. Most of our clients are unloved. Uh, very few clients are articulate and attractive like Lela, our more typical client is visibly disoriented, dressed inappropriately for for weather, louse-ridden, um, angry, hostile, making no sense when he talks, these people are not loved within our society, and I think that gives us something to think about. 

00:56:05
BILL MCCLOUD Good, thank you. If I could, while I was listening to the questioning I was thinking of some lines of, uh, Dr. Laing's uh, poem, knots, and the lines which occurred to me have a lot of iron in them, of course, but they apply to you and me perhaps. They are playing a game, they are not playing a game. How dare you laugh when Christ died for you. And I saw a lot of laughter, and as Dr. Minutian said, the contact between the two was an expression of the playfulness which can occur even when discussing subjects such as that. I'd like you to join with me in thanking the whole panel, and uh particularly the main speakers. 

00:56:45
