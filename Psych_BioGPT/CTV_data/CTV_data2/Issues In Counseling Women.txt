ISSUES IN COUNSELING WOMEN: Case Studies in Feminist Therapy Norma Block Gluckstern Mary Bradford Ivey 

00:00:00
ELIZABETH BOHN  Feminist Therapy is concerned with providing a different voice for counseling and therapy. Why do we need a different voice in the helping profession? Virtually, all theories of counseling at therapy had been developed by a middle class white males: Freud, Skinner, Rogers, Perls. Many of their, their ideas maybe helpful but ultimately much of traditional therapy practice is hierarchial and dominated by a male model. The purpose of this series of case studies is to illustrate a different, more relational voice in the helping profession, called Feminist Therapy. What is Feminist Therapy? Here is an adaptation of a definition provided by Mary Ballou and Nancy Gablock(ph). Feminist Therapy points out that current systems of helping are based on sexist assumptions about women. Rather than blame the victim, Feminist Therapy points out that many problems faced by women are caused by external factors in society. Because of this research, personality theory and clinical practice needs serious examination. Feminist Therapy is eclectic, drawing on many old and new approaches to helping. It emphasizes women's strengths rather than their weaknesses and deficits. The relationship in Feminist Therapy is egalitarian and equal rather than hierarchial and dominated by the counselor. With this brief definition let us turn to the need for feminist therapy and why it is developed so strongly in recent years. In the following brief tape example you will see a man counseling a woman in midlife crisis, who feels a vague sense of dissatisfaction. Note what it does. After this demonstration is over, stop the tape and discuss what the male helper does which is typical of what might happen in sexist counseling and therapy.

Case Study #1 Why Feminist Therapy is Needed. Allen Ivey Norma Gluckstern Mary Ivey 

00:02:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You know Allen, I'm really nervous but I'd like to start to build in and then I'd like to go back to graduate school. 

00:03:15
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, yeah you'd like to go back to graduate school. 

00:03:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uhm, you know, the, the kids are all high school now and, and I need to get, if wanna go back to work, I, I need some advanced training and, and I don't understand Bill really was, was really upset with me when I told him I wanna go. (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
ALLEN IVEY Bill was upset, could you tell me a little bit more? 

00:03:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, he's always felt... (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...that, that it was all very well that I might wanna go back to work and he had, he kinda humor me through the years and now. 

00:03:45
ALLEN IVEY So he, he's really pretty been much very supportive, isn't he? 

00:03:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, he was really supportive, you know, and I don't understand... (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...now why he's objecting cause all those years... (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...it was okay. 

00:03:55
ALLEN IVEY What have you been doing differently, Norma? 

00:03:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You mean at the, the house or something like that? (inaudible ). 

00:04:03
ALLEN IVEY I mean if you build(ph) in behaving differently usually works some kind of a family thing. I mean what are you what, what have you been doing differently? 

00:04:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What, do you think maybe he's having some concern about my not being home? I mean, I haven't really thought about how he might be feeling, my, my going back to graduate school I didn't, I didn't think about that. 

00:04:20
ALLEN IVEY What has he said about it? 

00:04:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, you know, he sort of feels that... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...his position is so important and I, he always, he only wants me to continue having the dinner parties at night... (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...maybe he just, you know, maybe he's, he's afraid I won't do that or maybe he's right, I don't know. 

00:04:35
ALLEN IVEY (Sighs) Uh hmm. Yeah, there are marriages that break up, ah, when women go out to graduate school and so forth. And how do you feel about that? 

00:04:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, you're right. I may even, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
ALLEN IVEY There hadn't been some problems between you and Bill? 

00:04:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Oh, I really didn't think so but, I really didn't think that maybe that is one of a problem. (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. What did you, there must be some reason you wanna go back to ah, the graduate school... (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I don't think it was, you know, you, you look around, I mean, a lot of women are going back now. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN We could use a little extra money that kids are gonna be going to college and, ah, it would, I thought that it would be helpful I mean if I went back to graduate school... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I didn't think that cause all these problems. 

00:05:15
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. But there's some feeling of dissatisfaction you have, right? 

00:05:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, ah, you know, you just, you see sort of, (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:05:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I know I think, uhm, I mean, I don't think I'm happy in my marriage but I see things in life when you're getting older, you wanna get... 

00:05:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...the kids grew up and then... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, are there, there really is sometimes as we get older there gets to be feelings in dissatisfaction that things change. I think that if we ever sit down and start looking at this, ah, maybe you should go to graduate school but maybe if we sit down and talk about it we can help find out I think I need to... (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
ALLEN IVEY ...hear about what this graduate school thing really means to you, ah. 

00:05:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Seriously, maybe I'm doing this because I really, something else is bothering me and I don't even... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...recognize, is that what you're talking about? (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
ALLEN IVEY Well, it may very well be, normally, it's the right choice but I think we need to sit down and sort of look a little bit to history and ah, you know, look a little back at some of the family factors, ah, etcetera. 

00:06:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:06:05
ALLEN IVEY And ah, and we could go on from there and ah, I think it's important that you make your own choice. 

00:06:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, it's sort of hard, I mean, maybe you're, maybe, maybe you're right, maybe, maybe I should back off but, but I just... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
ALLEN IVEY No, I don't think you should back off but I think we, we can talk about it and then(ph) let's not rush into it. (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...I, I thought. 

00:06:25
Stop tape and list sexist behaviors of counselor. 

00:06:25
ELIZABETH BOHN  The preceding example was obviously condensed to include many points, which brought out the need for Feminist Therapy. Sad to say, many of the things demonstrated are still very much with us, although often hidden. Now, let us see the same case handled by a feminist therapist. Perhaps most important you will note here the egalitarian relationship in which the therapist and client seem to operate more as partners. 

00:07:00
Positive Model of Feminist Therapy 

00:07:00
ELIZABETH BOHN Mary will counsel Norma in a positive way. She will demonstrate sharing and the egalitarian relationship. The problem will be seen as developmental rather than as pathology. 

00:07:10
MARY IVEY  Hello, Norma, nice to see you. 

00:07:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Hello, Mary. I made this appointment to see you. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uhm, ah, a few, few months ago I went to a counselor because I was thinking about going to graduate, back to graduate school... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and ah, I have some problems about whether this was the right thing to do and when I left him and I felt kind of just, well, I felt that maybe the thing was not to go to graduate school but that doesn't seem to resolve my problems for me and someone said that you might be pretty helpful to talk to. You, had some with the same experience and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN so I thought I'd come here and ask you a little bit about how, you went about going back to graduate school. 

00:07:50
MARY IVEY Well, let's first talk about you, Norma. Uhm, let, I, I always like to begin with thinking about your strengths and ah, your interests and, and what brings you to this decision. 

00:08:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
MARY IVEY Give me little bit of background about you. 

00:08:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN well, ah, I've, I've been pretty much home... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...raising kids but I've been very active in the community. I've been on a number of the local board... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I've had, had a stand(ph), I'm the President of League of Women Voters. 

00:08:10
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:08:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And I've found out that I have some pretty good management skills and ah, I thought the time had come for me to maybe go back to graduate school and as a matter of fact I had gone down to the business school... (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and my, the graduate record is, is good enough. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I need a couple of statistical courses but basically the dean encouraged me to come back to business school. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
MARY IVEY Uh-huh, uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I felt there are a lot of opportunities. As I got really good about myself, I'm jumping out of the field and so I was encouraged and, and then I told my husband about it and uhm, it was the first, I suddenly felt my head, ah, dropped an atomic bomb or something in the house because he got really upset, (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN and didn't understand why I wanna go back to graduate school and ah, he even told me he didn't know, pretending as in you're going to business that the feeling was well, maybe if I went to homemaking but I went into business where I'd (inaudible ), what was that a feel for a woman and. (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
MARY IVEY You're right. Well, I could hear on the one hand you're getting the encouragement from the business school saying wherein(ph) all your community work, you've gained a lot of skills in management, and you've gone to the, the dean. He says, "Yes, it's okay except for a couple statistical courses," and sort of encouragement on the one hand. On the other hand, you've got your husband who might have been encouraging along the way when you were doing community activities and raising the children but now that you're into... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Correct. 

00:09:25
MARY IVEY ...Graduate school it's nice, and not quite so encouraging. So you're... (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's just, that's, that's about it. That's what you've got right now and ah. (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
MARY IVEY In this, you got the two things going in a, 

00:09:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I don't know what to, (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
MARY IVEY you're in a dilemma. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN and I don't know what to do because, ah, that other counselor really made me feel that ah, or maybe he said, what was wrong with my... 

00:09:45
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:09:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...marriage that I had this need to maybe go back to school and, ah, he was sort of giving me mixed messages too, and so I actually came here to... 

00:09:50
MARY IVEY  Yeah. 

00:09:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...see if you could help me sort some of these out 'coz I think I'm, I know I want to do something but I don't want, I don't wanna destroy my relationship in my marriage and my family. I want, I want it both. I guess I want it all. 

00:10:05
MARY IVEY You'd like to be a little of both without... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
MARY IVEY ...uhm, making too much disruptions, isn't it? 

00:10:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's right. 

00:10:10
MARY IVEY And it's uhm, and maybe that's sort of what feminist counseling is about. It's encouraging women in a society where, where we have mixed messages of needing to stay home and yet wanting to fulfill our own needs and desires and I'm sure you've seen a number of people, women out there now working. 

00:10:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I have. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
MARY IVEY Probably interested in, in fulfilling some of your needs now that the children are a little bit older. Maybe you could, uhm, one of the things you might be able to do is talk with your husband, uhm, about some of his issues and, and concerns about it. Uhm, for example, if you went back to work what, what might be a plus if you're going back to work? How is(ph) the pluses and minuses, how much you, what, what would you, what would you think he see as a plus if you're going back to work? (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN As, as a matter of fact that, that you mentioned the plus we are (inaudible ) all going to college and it's, I mean, we make, he makes a very good living but it's strain(ph) when you had, (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
MARY IVEY Exactly(ph). 

00:11:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN when you have three kids going to school and the sort of things, so I thought one of the things that he'd be delighted was that I will also help provide, ah, in some assistance and so that we could do some of the things that I find, that we aren't doing because we already have this big financial expense with the kids at school. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
MARY IVEY Yes, so you're going back to work and retooling, and getting an education would help financially... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
MARY IVEY ...with the education. You and your husband would have little extra money to do some things together so maybe even talking to him about, uhm, those kind of pluses. (laughs) 

00:11:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Could I ask you a personal question? (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
MARY IVEY Yes, sure. 

00:11:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, I heard that you had some, that, that your story is sort of similar to mine by the person that recommended you... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:11:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and I wonder if it could ah, how did it all, it looks pretty good from my sitting here. 

00:11:40
MARY IVEY Well, it, ah, was, it was good. It was a little rocky along the way at times uhm, things have to change. You know you have to uhm, do things a little bit differently. Everybody's got to cooperate when mom goes back to school including children, everybody, the role has change a little bit. And ah, you got to bring your... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Could you tell me a little bit more about? (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
MARY IVEY ...have to bring your husband aboard doing a little bit of the work along with the kids and instead of you doing it all much like I'm sure you did it all, and I do it all, you have to bring everybody on it, aboard and, and retool and, and, and. 

00:12:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Did you find a lot of resistance or did you find people being unhappy or slamming doors and... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
MARY IVEY Now(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  this sort of things that I think I'm beginning to experience. 

00:12:15
MARY IVEY You're beginning to feel a little of resistance already, maybe you need to talk with, with your family about it and your needs and how uhm, you know, you would like to be able to do this. And I think it's, it's a very big step and I, I think we as women need a lot of support to make these kinds of decisions. I found it very helpful, time to have a support group of other women who are retooling going back to school and, and we had a chance to talk about some of these things and how they handled just managing the household when you're so busy now and, and doing all the things you used to doing. I know you do a lot of entertaining. 

00:12:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
MARY IVEY And a lot of organizational things and how you handle all these things. 

00:12:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN But, but you just mentioned support group and uhm, then the whole world knows your problems. I mean, I know, I'm coming here and I'm almost embarrassed. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:13:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And if I go to support group, you know, well, everybody know about Bill and myself and so maybe that's a concern I have of. 

00:13:05
MARY IVEY Yeah. You feel like you don't wanna talk with other people but I think that uhm, particularly the Everywoman's Center are very concerned about women really being able to make a contri, do their thing, make a contribution and, and they're there to support you and to encourage you and to help you through the whole graduate school process which can be very difficult sometimes, and, and I, I think it's helpful. You don't have to share all your personal things but I think just to get some support and to hear other people, get some ideas from other people, how are they doing things. 

00:13:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's funny you men, (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
MARY IVEY Okay(ph). 

00:13:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN mentioned the Everywoman's Center because my perception of that Everywoman's Center is they were a bunch of un, dissatisfied women and that they're all getting... (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:13:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...divorce and, and in some ways I didn't even wanna be associated with that... (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And the, the thought that maybe I draw(ph) them as a support group is, is somewhat interesting ah, 'coz I think through the years I've kind of ah, ah, felt almost like I wouldn't need anything like that and to find myself in this position ah, is it's, it's really very interesting. 

00:14:05
Stop and list distinctions between this tape and the first example. Case Study #2 Women Counseling Women Kathy Bohn Mary Ivey Norma Gluckstern 

00:14:05
ELIZABETH BOHN  Let us see a negative and positive example of women counseling women. In the following example, a high school student wants to continue the study of science. Research has shown that some women avoid science and math. One of the reasons is sexist counseling by both men and women. 

00:14:45
MARY IVEY Hi, Kathy. How are you today? 

00:14:45
KATHY BOHN Good. 

00:14:45
MARY IVEY Good. 

00:14:45
KATHY BOHN Fine. (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
MARY IVEY I understand you wanna talk about your schedule. 

00:14:50
KATHY BOHN Yes, I do. 

00:14:50
MARY IVEY This year. What's the situation? 

00:14:50
KATHY BOHN The situation is I would like to uhm, engage in a full, full schedule, physics and all... 

00:14:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
KATHY BOHN  and science, math, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
MARY IVEY What, what do you mean by full schedule with? 

00:15:00
KATHY BOHN I'd like to take all subjects. I would, I would not like to take a break, anything I'd like to. 

00:15:05
MARY IVEY You like a whole solid, just like the same... (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
KATHY BOHN  Just like the same. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
MARY IVEY ...what you've been doing... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
KATHY BOHN Yes, I've been doing. Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
MARY IVEY ...last few years, French, English... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
KATHY BOHN Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
MARY IVEY Social Studies.(crosstalk) 

00:15:10
KATHY BOHN  Math. 

00:15:15
MARY IVEY Math, and Physics? 

00:15:15
KATHY BOHN And Physics, yes. 

00:15:15
MARY IVEY Kathy, my goodness this is your senior year you're going to do it again? You know, how busy you were last year with student council when, and all your swimming and drama? 

00:15:25
KATHY BOHN But I, but I did well. I did well in chemistry and I really feel that, I feel that I can do it. 

00:15:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
KATHY BOHN I feel that it's, it's something I wanna do. 

00:15:30
MARY IVEY  Physics, though, I mean, is that, I mean I can understand why'd you wanna take French and English, and you know, you need those for college but, you know, Kathy I wouldn't some of course, like foods or. 

00:15:45
Positive Model of Career Counseling 

00:15:45
ELIZABETH BOHN  Now, let's see another example. This time Norma will provide support for Kathy as a developing woman. 

00:15:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kathy, ah, I called you in because I was checking the schedule. I was putting on the computer and I noticed that you've changed your schedule from last, ah, when we, what we decided last ah, spring. 

00:16:05
KATHY BOHN Yes, I've decided not to take physics this year. 

00:16:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What happened? 

00:16:10
KATHY BOHN Uhm, it was a decision over the summer, which my parents and I both made and I just felt that, felt very strongly about take, not taking it. I've done well in chemistry, really had nothing to do with last year, just felt really more, I'm just more interested in this in, in, in the languages and social studies and Englishes(ph) and science would just deter me from, from, from that. 

00:16:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Was that your decision? I didn't quite understand when you started talking. 

00:16:35
KATHY BOHN Oh, oh yeah. It was my decision. I think my parents influenced me, I think in some way. They really felt that it was just too much for me. It was uhm, physics would just, would just be ex, extra work and extra work I'm, I'm really not interested in and I guess they really made me see that. You know, I'm, I've been interested in communications for a number of years and, and I'm really enjoying that area. I enjoy English, I enjoy writing, and I think the hard core of physics is just not for me. 

00:17:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's funny, you, you sound different this year than you've done in the past and it doesn't, I, I don't, it doesn't confute(ph) for me. What's, what's happened? Because I thought your interest was really in the sciences. 

00:17:10
KATHY BOHN  I think it was at first, uhm, but I really, I mean I, I tried hard at it and I did okay. I, I did well on chemistry but, but it was just almost too much struggle and I really, I had a knack for writing and I, I, I spoke well in the languages. My teachers encouraged me, have encouraged me in that direction. I haven't really had much encouragement in the field of physics or the field of science. 

00:17:35
MARY IVEY  I'm getting two messages. I'm getting one, that you really liked the communications and you did well. 

00:17:40
KATHY BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:17:40
MARY IVEY  But on the other one I also hear you didn't get encouragement on sciences, this is maybe that's why you're not going to sciences. 

00:17:50
KATHY BOHN No, no, I've really, I have decided that by myself... (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
MARY IVEY Okay. 

00:17:55
KATHY BOHN Not, even without the encouragement that communications and, and pursuant(ph) of, of English and Social Studies, and, and language in my next four years is really something I wanna do. 

00:18:05
Stop tape and discuss differences between the two examples. Case Study #3 The Superwoman Complex Jean Moss Mary Ivey 

00:18:05
ELIZABETH BOHN  One of the problems which women have today, is the superwoman syndrome. We've got to do it all or we haven't made it. To really make it, a woman has to work, cook, clean, and take care of the family, and be beautiful and sexy for her partner. One common counseling problem you will run into is the overachiever, who has simply burned out from trying to do it all. Increasingly, Feminist Therapy is emphasizing that women have to choose their priorities in what they consider most important. 

00:19:00
JEAN MOSS Well, here we are and ah, it's good to see you... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
MARY IVEY Nice to see you too, (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
JEAN MOSS  healthy(ph) and... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
MARY IVEY ...I'm really... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
JEAN MOSS ...I think it would be a good thing for you to just begin talking about ah, some of that(ph) concerns you come with, at this time. 

00:19:15
MARY IVEY Well, I came to you, Jean, 'coz I just think you're so great and so helpful and I have just been feeling so stressed out trying to, I guess, do it all. 

00:19:25
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
MARY IVEY Trying to be a mother and wife and professional woman... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
MARY IVEY  carrying on the career with the school system and also, you know, working on enormous college and, (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

00:19:30
MARY IVEY  and then trying to keep up with my husband like ah, husband's activities, it's just, I just feels like too much. And the other day we just were working and, and there are some people over here working and then I went to serve them some orders and snacks and there was, I realized that I haven't even gone shopping and there wasn't even any food in the house to serve them. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
MARY IVEY There weren't, there wasn't even a cookie or a cracker or a piece of cheese or anything and I was just embarrassed and thought I cannot do it all. I can't even get groceries in the house and continue with this pace. 

00:20:00
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

00:20:00
MARY IVEY And anyway I just thought, "You seem to handle it all so cool, Jean, I thought maybe you'd be of some help to me, to sort some of these things out and, and ah, figure out how I can handle a little bit better. 

00:20:10
JEAN MOSS Yeah, it, ah, I really want to know who's sitting here in this chair because I don't see it quite the same way you do, and I guess that maybe it's what's what happens with this isn't it, that, we're doing all these things and people see us and they, and they see(ph) a very glowing terms, and we ourselves are, we sort of sitting saying "When am I gonna get it together?" Uhm, I, I, I must say that right now, ah, ah, I'm owning(ph) some of the things that I do well but I also know that there are too many of them that fall (inaudible ), but you're kind enough to say that. I would, it's all sort of sounds like it all sort of came together in one clump therefore a minute or two. 

00:20:45
MARY IVEY  Hmm. 

00:20:50
JEAN MOSS Uhm, and you found yourself standing, wondering how do I, how do I get it all sort of finished off, you know. 

00:20:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
JEAN MOSS And, and I guess my, I, what I've come to understand is, do I have to get it all finished off? Why are you taking all of this on? 

00:21:05
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
JEAN MOSS Why, what are you trying to achieve? Ah, who has the red pencil marking in your margins and, you know what I'm saying? 

00:21:15
MARY IVEY Who's marking the pen, (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
JEAN MOSS I, yeah. I mean, ah, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
MARY IVEY who's marking the margins and saying I'm doing... (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
JEAN MOSS you say I have the answers but I'm convinced that we have our own answers. 

00:21:20
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:21:20
JEAN MOSS  So I just wanna sort of throw some questions at you and, (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
JEAN MOSS and try to get you thinking about uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
JEAN MOSS what, what's going on and what, what are you trying... (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:21:30
JEAN MOSS ...to, to have(ph) it happened to you. You were really clearly talking about that big SW, superwoman. 

00:21:40
MARY IVEY (laughs) I get that. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
JEAN MOSS Now, the other side of that coin is stupid woman. 

00:21:40
MARY IVEY (laughs) I love that. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
JEAN MOSS You know, (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
MARY IVEY I think you're probably right. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
JEAN MOSS so I mean you can (laughs), on the (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:21:48
MARY IVEY There're all three(ph) sides of it. (crosstalk) 

00:21:48
JEAN MOSS Yeah, and, and, and ah, so, something is sort of yanking your chain here. What's, what's going on? 

00:21:55
MARY IVEY I think I hear you. I, I really do and it's maybe just trying to push it too far. Just trying to do too many things and not really stepping back and saying "What is it do I, what is that I really want." (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

00:22:05
MARY IVEY "And what can I do?" (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
MARY IVEY And you know, "What's possible? What's feasible?" And... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
JEAN MOSS Yeah(ph). 

00:22:10
MARY IVEY ...maybe even putting too many expectations on myself, trying to do it all perfectly, to do it all and then to do it all perfectly on top of it. 

00:22:15
JEAN MOSS  And there, there is, there's that other key, too many expectations on yourself. 

00:22:20
MARY IVEY  Uh-huh, uh-huh. Probably not even other people putting in, remind(ph) as much as myself saying that I have to do all these things. 

00:22:30
JEAN MOSS Now, is that the case, I mean, do, are you. (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
MARY IVEY Really, you know, how it is Jean, you have this. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
JEAN MOSS It's sort of a little bit of both of it. 

00:22:35
MARY IVEY Right. We have to, we are professional women and we have certain amount of responsibilities. We have to do our jobs and we are mothers and wives and whatever, and, and, and so you're, there are certain roles that we have to play and then, and then, I think we add to it our own other agendas... (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
MARY IVEY ...besides that. 

00:22:50
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
MARY IVEY  And it, it uhm, gets to be a balancing act and sometimes it gets to be too much I guess. 

00:22:55
JEAN MOSS Yeah, and sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
MARY IVEY It tips too much the other way. (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
JEAN MOSS ...it tips too far. 

00:23:00
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:23:00
JEAN MOSS Now, looking at it, you, your life is filled. And it's, it's wonderfully fill and a lot of women would say "I wish it were me" but here you are saying, all right it is me, and what I've finding out here is that I haven't gotten, a handle on some of these. 

00:23:15
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:23:15
JEAN MOSS Uhm, what, what needs right now, if you had to, if I was gonna give you a billion dollars in the next thirty seconds, for getting some priorities in order. 

00:23:25
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:23:25
JEAN MOSS  What, what would some of them be? I mean, you(ph) give yourself, just a couple of seconds to think about that, not to have sort of a knee jerk reaction... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
JEAN MOSS  but really think about yourself and what's happening in your environment and, (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
JEAN MOSS and what's driving you at this rather, rather frantic pace right now. 

00:23:45
MARY IVEY Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:23:45
JEAN MOSS  You know, what is it that absolutely right now, has to keep moving and has to get done? (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:23:55
JEAN MOSS And is there any possibility that you could delegate something? 

00:23:55
MARY IVEY  That is a very good thought. I, I do think, and I did think, as you were talking about these things, I think the most important, what is really important to me and the most important things really, you know, are being, a wife and a mother, those things first. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
MARY IVEY  And then third, fitting in my role as a professional woman that maybe not taking on quite so much... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
MARY IVEY ...of that role, and maybe there's a way of cutting back so that it all, you know, has meaning so it doesn't feel so frantic and not trying to do quite so many... 

00:24:30
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
MARY IVEY ...different things, and ah, I think there are things that can be delegated. I think that ah, my family might be able to help in doing some of the food shopping so I wouldn't feel responsible for... (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
MARY IVEY ...that kind of thing, and so it's not me looking at the refrigerator saying "Wow, there's nothing there to eat, I get it because I haven't going shopping. Maybe somebody else can help with that kind of thing and maybe somebody could help with, some other things around the house so that those things go a little bit more smoothly. 

00:24:55
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. I mean it seem so simple. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
MARY IVEY I might use some delegation. Uh hmm.(crosstalk) 

00:24:55
JEAN MOSS You know, it seems so simple but we often, I mean, sort of the brilliant thing to do is to do the simple thing, with finesse, isn't it? 

00:25:00
MARY IVEY  Uhm, I like that. (laughs) 

00:25:05
JEAN MOSS You know ah, and not sort of complicate it. 

00:25:05
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:25:05
JEAN MOSS  Ah, and find ourselves really, ah, in a binder, in a corner. 

00:25:10
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:25:10
JEAN MOSS Uhm, when I look at the Superwoman syndrome, and I've gone through it, you, you said it. I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
MARY IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JEAN MOSS I, I've gone through it, and continue to affect(ph), it's almost you, you don't know it but you sort of get addicted to it. You do all of these things and everyone says "Brush(ph) she did all of that, and her hair isn't even mussed." 

00:25:30
MARY IVEY (laughs) And why can't you do some more? You do it so beautifully. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
JEAN MOSS You do it so well. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
MARY IVEY And then somebody... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
JEAN MOSS Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
MARY IVEY ...then they tell you some more things to do. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

00:25:35
MARY IVEY And, you know, there you are doing more and more, and it doesn't seem to end. 

00:25:40
JEAN MOSS And, and we buy it. 

00:25:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
JEAN MOSS I mean, I think early conditioning that we...(crosstalk) 

00:25:45
MARY IVEY Right(ph). 

00:25:45
JEAN MOSS ...go through as women. I mean, in women, and we've heard it time and time again, this holds true for me... (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:25:50
JEAN MOSS ...and that is, ah, when you describe yourself, you say, I want to do things to help people. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
JEAN MOSS I want to make people feel good. I want to help everybody in the world. I want to... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:26:00
JEAN MOSS ...ah, be reverent and chaste and true and it is just deadening when, when you, (laughs) when you try to carry all of those... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
MARY IVEY All those things. 

00:26:10
JEAN MOSS ...you know, bags... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
JEAN MOSS ...around on your shoulders. It is truly a burden, and then the... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
JEAN MOSS ...burdened woman is somehow revered and extolled because look at how she, well she bears up. I don't wanna bear up. You know, I mean, it, I don't wanna bear up. 

00:26:25
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:26:25
JEAN MOSS I want to go through life, as best I can with a certain amount of balance and a certain sense that I'm managing... (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
JEAN MOSS  what's happening, and very often I manage my office ve, more, much better than I manage my house because it's more allowed. 

00:26:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
JEAN MOSS In my office, it's expected that I run things and at home it's expected that I do things. 

00:26:45
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:26:45
JEAN MOSS  In my office I can delegate and the secretary will take so much, and I can ferret(ph) it off here and there and do my part and so on... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
JEAN MOSS ...and then pull it all together, see that the product has been, (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:27:00
JEAN MOSS been ah, generated. 

00:27:00
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
JEAN MOSS But at home, you know, ah, I found, ah, that when I did, the kids did, and when I stop doing, they stop doing. I mean. (Laughs) 

00:27:10
MARY IVEY And everything stops there? (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
JEAN MOSS Exactly. 

00:27:10
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
JEAN MOSS And so everything stops... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
JEAN MOSS ...and how do you get it so that it is ongoing, and then not feel guilty about it because... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
MARY IVEY Guilty, that's a sin too. 

00:27:20
JEAN MOSS The, the big guilt... (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
JEAN MOSS ...is on. You know, how... (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
MARY IVEY The big guilt trip. 

00:27:20
JEAN MOSS ...and, and I think all of us are still, sort of working that through. 

00:27:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
JEAN MOSS How do you do it and not feel guilty? How do you do it and not feel like, the dominating woman? 

00:27:30
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:27:30
JEAN MOSS  Oh, we've got labels, have we got labels? (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
MARY IVEY Oh, we sure do. 

00:27:35
JEAN MOSS I mean, we're, we're, we're we're the dominated, do, dominating woman. If we say, if we start delegating. 

00:27:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
JEAN MOSS You know. 

00:27:40
MARY IVEY  Taking charge and delegating (inaudible ) to other people(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:27:46
JEAN MOSS Quick backlash. 

00:27:46
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:46
JEAN MOSS Passive aggressive, sometimes ah, actions on the part of family. Not just, not to put our families down but sometimes, they don't know that they're doing it because we've been doing our superwoman bit(ph) so well... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
JEAN MOSS ...or stupid woman bit(ph), then you know, how you flip that coin. 

00:28:00
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
JEAN MOSS Uhm, in your own life, what would happen if you said "I can't do". 

00:28:05
MARY IVEY  X, well I, that's what I think I have to start saying. It's, it's, perhaps to start saying no to some of these extra things. I mean, I think there was a point when I had a balance and then I think what happened is, I did all that so well but it just got to be more and more and more, and I just didn't say no, I just kept saying yes, of course, you know, I can handle that, yes, yes, yes, and I think the answer is to say no to things. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
JEAN MOSS What, what would happen if, a big project is going on, and after all, your house... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
JEAN MOSS ...is a very vital house. Your husband is professional. You're a professional. Your daughter... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
JEAN MOSS ...is, is, is a college woman. This is a vital house, (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
JEAN MOSS home that you're, that you're a part of. What would happen if you didn't just simply say "no", but you said "help"? 

00:28:50
MARY IVEY I think that that's what needs to be said. I think that we are family, and a good family team, and I think we need to all sort of step back... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
MARY IVEY  and look at the things that need to be done and, and I just need to say "I need some help in some of these... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
MARY IVEY  areas." Not only here, at work I have the same problem. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
MARY IVEY I think I'm not saying no to things and I need some help, and I have to do the same thing at work, that I do here and I just say, (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
MARY IVEY "Enough is enough. This is what I can do and I can't do it anymore and I need your help." 

00:29:15
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
Case Study #4 Black Women and Feminism Jean Moss Sonya Clark 

00:29:15
ELIZABETH BOHN  Women of different ethnic and racial backgrounds may have different opinions of feminism. Sometimes, feminism is viewed as a White, middle class exercise. Jean Moss will interview Sonya Clark, and discuss some of these key issues. 

00:29:45
JEAN MOSS Sonya, it's uhm, it's kinda nice to have a chance to, to sit down and talk about uhm, the issues of, of counseling and, and providing help for women of color, and particularly Black women of, of Afro-Caribbean women who es, es, especially since you were from the Ca, Caribbean sort of looking at, at how the feminist issues, as they are now defined, do or do not have uhm, a positive im, impact in, in a healthy(ph) situation with Black women. I personally, uhm, I'm still sort of looking at, at feminine, some of the definitions of ah, feminism and uhm, and don't, don't probably, I don't myself uhm, label myself as a feminist, but embrace our meaning of the standards that they, that they, they ah, hold, hold important. Uhm, we were talking as we were coming here... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
SONYA CLARK  Uhm. 

00:31:00
JEAN MOSS ...to, to do this tape about how we feel about, in, unequal treatment, and uhm, and how we probably would hold anyone accountable who, (titters) who would dare to ah, infringe upon our dignity and self-esteem by somehow because we're women or a Black women or Caribbean women. Uhm, somehow see us as being less than as a result of that, but I've been doing that for so long. I personally you know, by the time the feminist movement got going, I have been on that road for a long time, ah, and I think a lot Black women, would say so. Do you, do you have a definition of feminism that, that you've been dealing with, or, or, you know, what is your definition of it or what, what definitions that now exist sort of intrigue you or get your attention? 

00:31:55
SONYA CLARK One of the things that I was thinking about earlier in, in confronting this issue was, that uhm, being raised by Caribbean parents. 

00:32:05
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
SONYA CLARK Where in the Caribbean, it was quite natural... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
SONYA CLARK ...for uhm, a woman to become a doctor... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
SONYA CLARK uhm, or a lawyer. It was very natural. 

00:32:15
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
SONYA CLARK Uhm, be, but being raised in that culture, of that culture because my parents saw that way, (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
JEAN MOSS Hmm. 

00:32:20
SONYA CLARK but in the United States, and then being told in this country that uhm, both being woman and being Black meant that there were certain places that you couldn't go... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
JEAN MOSS  Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
SONYA CLARK ...very easily. 

00:32:35
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
SONYA CLARK Uhm, made it a little bit difficult for me to swallow... (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
SONYA CLARK ...so to speak, and so the feminist movement was intriguing in that way because it was uhm, standing out for a justice... (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
SONYA CLARK ...you know, uhm, because there is an injustice, (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
SONYA CLARK there is no reason why I as a woman should not be allowed to do something. 

00:32:55
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
SONYA CLARK Or uhm, being a Black person, I should not be allowed to do something. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:33:00
SONYA CLARK Uhm, but yet still I sense that there's a, there's a, there's a specific sort of difference between the uhm, the, the feminist movement, in of itself because it tends to think of, uhm, women as a group. 

00:33:20
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
SONYA CLARK You know, sort of, ah, and men as being the oppressors. 

00:33:25
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
SONYA CLARK And uhm, as a Black woman, I don't necessarily think of Black men as being my oppressor. 

00:33:30
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
SONYA CLARK Uhm, what I would tend to say is that the White male has more dominants character in this society, would be, more likely to be my oppressor, so my, my uhm, oppressor is a little bit more narrowed down. 

00:33:45
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
SONYA CLARK  So to speak. Uhm, and in that instance, it's, it's not to say that there's a hatred, or a dislike, or anything like that but it's just a realization... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
SONYA CLARK ...of, of exactly who it is that might be saying, "Well, you can't do that." 

00:34:05
JEAN MOSS Okay. 

00:34:05
SONYA CLARK Uhm, a matter of fact uhm, one of the things that perhaps hurts me the most is to see uhm, a Black male sort of stand back and say, "An educated Black woman, I'm sort of intimidated by you." 

00:34:20
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
SONYA CLARK And I said, "No, no, no. I don't want you to be (laughs) intimidated by me, you're not the person I want, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
SONYA CLARK sort of you say, "I can do what I wanna do", you should, you should realize that I, I, I can and so can you, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
SONYA CLARK But, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
JEAN MOSS  What, what are you majoring in? 

00:34:35
SONYA CLARK I'm majoring in psychology. 

00:34:35
JEAN MOSS Okay. That's interesting. 

00:34:35
SONYA CLARK So, I'm very interested in humanities through, that's the reason, for racial issues. 

00:34:40
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
SONYA CLARK As a matter of fact, but uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

00:34:45
SONYA CLARK I think that uhm, perhaps that difference in, in our generations... (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
SONYA CLARK ...has a lot to do with, with the issue as well because I haven't, I wasn't raised during the Civil Rights Movement or anything like that, you know, I was a baby. When Martin Luther King was in Washington... (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
SONYA CLARK ...I was being born (laughs), but uhm, and so the, the Black issue, you know, is a lot more subtle now. 

00:35:15
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
SONYA CLARK You know as far as racism it's a lot more, it's a more subtler racism that I'm dealing with. 

00:35:20
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
SONYA CLARK But the questions of uhm, of feminism are still there, you know, people still call women " girls". (laughs) 

00:35:30
JEAN MOSS Yes. (laughs) 

00:35:30
SONYA CLARK And they say, "Well, we call men guys" so the natural thing is girls, and I say (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
SONYA CLARK "No, a girl is ah, a female human being who has not reached puberty, I'm past puberty (laughs) at this point, you know, and uhm, I'm a woman and little things like that that are engrained in our society, that, if the least I could ask for is for the awareness to be raised, you know, and uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
JEAN MOSS Good point. 

00:35:55
SONYA CLARK uhm, but it, it, it is, it a sense a little different for me because uhm, it's not really two battles that I'm fighting, it's not the Black issue, and uhm, and the, the issue of being a woman, as well. It's more of a, a covert racism that I'm dealing with than an overt racism that my mother or, or someone in your generation was talking about. So. 

00:36:20
JEAN MOSS  Well, when you talk about uhm, the difference in the generations, and we look at uhm, the kind of assertive roles we've always in, and, and in fact, I must admit... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
SONYA CLARK  Uh-huh. 

00:36:40
JEAN MOSS ...that early on I think I was in really in a, into aggressive mode because you had the feeling of having to take, and not just because you're a woman, but also because you're Black. I was brought up by a wo, an Afro-American mother and, and father, and my mother really did take the lead in child rearing, and she set the philosophy. My mother's philosophy was, you should never get married but you should get an education because you should be on your own. There was no question in her mind that to be independent, to be self, uhm, sort of... (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
SONYA CLARK (inaudible ) 

00:37:18
JEAN MOSS ...in charge of yourself, self managing, (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
SONYA CLARK Yes. 

00:37:20
JEAN MOSS was really a very key part of her, of her philosophy, and we bought into it. I mean, education was a key to freedom. It wasn't "the key" to freedom. It was our key to freedom. Your, your sex, I think, in terms of, if you had any inclination there was sexism, it was in effect that she, she was not foursquare for marriage, now she herself was married all the time and forever. But I suspected, hey, she might have made some different choices you see. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
SONYA CLARK Uh-huh. 

00:37:50
JEAN MOSS I'm not sure again, based on the feminist ah, movement as it now stands. Uhm, my concerns with it is that, I think very similar to your own. I do not see Black males as a primary ah, oppressors. Now they are oppressive. I'm not going to, (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
SONYA CLARK Take it away. 

00:38:10
JEAN MOSS they don't get off scot free. They've got their own sort of chauvinistic ah, code, but when it comes to uhm, it having equal opportunities to go about your business in the workplace and setting policies and that sort of thing, my own personal experience, because I worked mostly in predominantly White situations is that the Black male has not been my impediment. 

00:38:35
SONYA CLARK Uh-huh. 

00:38:35
JEAN MOSS So he, while he is not the primary figure, he's, he certainly doesn't get a, get away, ah, free. I guess what it what, what uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
SONYA CLARK I, can I just add something as well. 

00:38:45
JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:38:45
SONYA CLARK  One of the other reasons that I think it's a little different is that the Black family, if I may generalize... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
SONYA CLARK ...has always had this strong mother figure. 

00:38:55
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
SONYA CLARK  So that to think of my mother as being an oppressed woman... (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:39:00
SONYA CLARK  you know, is a very difficult thing to do because I've seen her take the most difficult of family situations... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
SONYA CLARK ...and handle them with a great deal of tact... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:39:10
SONYA CLARK  or not even such tact, but the point that she's handled them. 

00:39:15
JEAN MOSS (laughs) She handled them. 

00:39:20
SONYA CLARK (laughs) You know, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
JEAN MOSS That's the point. She handled them. Yeah. 

00:39:20
SONYA CLARK And I think that's sort of a pervasive thing in our culture. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
JEAN MOSS I know, so (inaudible ). It is. It is. We have to be careful. That, we have to be careful, I think, because Black women and White women sitting here say, "How can they, what did they say?" What I'm saying is that the oppressive factors are, within the culture are very different from the oppress, oppressive factors in the largest society. 

00:39:45
SONYA CLARK Right. 

00:39:45
JEAN MOSS And in the largest society, where my mother was a domestic, the White woman, as well as the White male, were key factors. The white woman did not give the domestics social security or even sometimes good work situations to work in and so I, you know, I'm still working through those issues myself, that the white women and the white male are for me entities to be reckoned with when it comes to oppression and ah, it, it, it will really be hard for me to simply buy in to ah, feminist movements without thinking those things through. 

00:40:25
[sil.] 

00:40:25
ELIZABETH BOHN  Ms. Moss as you discussed with Sonya earlier, there're problems with, there are problems with the use of Feminist Therapy in working with women of different races. 

00:40:35
JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

00:40:35
ELIZABETH BOHN Can you expand on this? 

00:40:40
JEAN MOSS Uhm, yes I, I, I guessed I'll start at where my conversation with Sonya sort of, sort of ended. Uhm, I'll start with the fact that from the standpoint that I come from, born and raised in the south uhm, live through the 60's ah, period uhm, was there at the emerging of the, the feminist movement in the late 60's and then to the 70's and now at 80's women as it were uhm, that I think for me there's a genesis that has to be looked at and as far as the relationship between uhm, White women and Black women and the genesis for me goes back to the time when my mother was a domestic worker and other women like her were domestic workers and their employers were all women and those women were in some ways quite oppressive especially when it came down to giving good pay and sometimes good working conditions, they were not easily available to them. You're quite fortunate if you've got an employer who was sensitive to you and caring about you and that I say that the white women is as much a part, an oppressive factor to be reckoned with ah, (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
ELIZABETH BOHN Uhm. 

00:42:05
JEAN MOSS in this whole notion of ah, of ah, of gender equality... (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
JEAN MOSS That the White woman has been an oppressive and has in some ways been complicit in as much as the White men in oppressing a Black woman and uhm, eh, especially since they were more under their direct employment. That, that for me sets up questions of trust, sets up questions of ah, class, class issues ah, that ah, White counselor if she's coming... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
JEAN MOSS ...from a feminist standpoint really needs to take into consideration and the Blacks a, a Black intellectual in, in developing these theories must I think take a look at that history. I don't think you have to dwell lodge behind it but it will inform you as to why perhaps you might run into barriers in the counseling arena into helping, helping ah, relationship. 

00:43:00
ELIZABETH BOHN So White woman you're saying need to look and try to empathize at least? 

00:43:05
JEAN MOSS Yeah(ph), I think White and Black women... (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
JEAN MOSS ...of what, let's, let us take it to this level. 

00:43:10
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
JEAN MOSS We're talking about developing theory. I think we've talked about intellectuals... (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
ELIZABETH BOHN  Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
JEAN MOSS ah, as they go, ah, forth and looking at ways in which to setup viable theories. I think that's part of the history that will inform... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
JEAN MOSS ...what direction you'll take in putting the theory together. 

00:43:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
JEAN MOSS Everything should be looked at and there's a painful piece of history to look at because it's our favorite, ah, our favorite target in this is White men. 

00:43:35
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:43:35
JEAN MOSS I mean, its easy for all of us to jump on White men and Lord knows that they've done enough to give us some good grist for our meal but that's not the, its all to me, that is not the only person you see. 

00:43:45
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
JEAN MOSS And I think if you look at diaries of domestic workers or, or, or, or text that have gone into the stories of domestic workers, you will then begin to see that well now what does this do without impression of White women and when they become therapist, are those impressions release ah, ah, free of this notion of; "Can I trust you? Are you really for me? Do you really care about me?" 

00:44:10
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:44:10
JEAN MOSS And caring about the person is key to having a good client... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
ELIZABETH BOHN Yes. 

00:44:15
JEAN MOSS ...ah, counselor relationship. 

00:44:15
ELIZABETH BOHN  Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
Case Study #5 Crisis Counseling Elizabeth Bohn Norma Gluckstern 

00:44:20
ELIZABETH BOHN  Crisis counseling is an, an important part of Feminist Therapy. Uhm, in the following example, Norma Gluckstern will counsel a young woman whose been a victim of date rape but before we show this tape, I'd like to have Norma tell us the central concepts which are important in feminist crisis counseling. Norma can you tell us a few of the central concepts? 

00:44:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I think the central concept is to provide a supportive environment... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...that when someone comes in with a crisis have been, have been raped, then what they need to feel is that they are safe and they're secure. And so that, that is the core of crisis counseling. 

00:45:05
ELIZABETH BOHN  Can you expand a little more on what a supportive environment means? 

00:45:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, what it mean is that you will have to be both supportive emotionally, listen to them, and then ah, support them in some very practical matters like suddenly there are some decisions and sometimes you have make as to whether they're gonna press charges. 

00:45:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Hmm. 

00:45:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So you have two levels if you try to support the, a rape victim. 

00:45:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Hmm, and in terms of legal implications Norma, do you become involve legally as a counselor? 

00:45:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Why, I don't think we become involve legally but what we do is we support and will in fact go with the rape victim to talk to a lawyer, ah, to discuss the issue with the police. That is, it would be untypical on a normal counseling center where the counselor was not of being attendance and, and very often these women do need that support because ah, that's very hard for them to ah, often press charges. 

00:46:00
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm, I've often heard the term "personal validation" uhm, in counseling, can you expand on that? 

00:46:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uhm, as a matter that fits in very much of why they don't want to go... (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...sometimes to a lawyer or to the police, is they asked themselves is this my fault? What did I do? How, could have done different, something differently? And what, we have to encourage them that this is not their fault, they do not have, they did not set up the situation. And so we validate their sense of themselves. 

00:46:25
ELIZABETH BOHN  Uh hmm, uhm, is there any network or, or some type of community help these women can go to? 

00:46:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah yes, we at the center and then there are in the community support groups. 

00:46:40
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN There are other women who'd experienced these and, and very often in case like this, individual counseling is not as meaningful as peer counseling 'coz these women have experienced the, the same trauma and they help each other get through it and so we, we encourage women to partake in a peer counseling experience rather than just one-on-one therapy. 

00:46:55
ELIZABETH BOHN  Uh hmm, I understand the trauma of rape. How far as a counselor will you probe? 

00:47:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Only as far as necessary. 

00:47:10
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN If a woman does not want to talk about it, it seems uncomfortable ah, and doesn't ah, just, just doesn't know where to push then our job is that just hang in there with them. At some point they probably, most of them, do feel a need to sort of get it all out, 'coz it's almost a feeling that you're just not clean. But you can't push women too fast because that just sets them in panic and, and tends to wanna withdraw rather than talk. 

00:47:30
ELIZABETH BOHN  Uh hmm, thank you. 

00:47:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kathy, my name is Norma. How can I help you? 

00:47:35
KATHY BOHN  Well, you know, it comes, I'm sort of uncomfortable being here. As it is my friend recommended that I, that I come and I, (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
KATHY BOHN and I talk to somebody about it. And I don't really know how to go about it, I just, I know that I have to tell somebody. 

00:47:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  We'll just talk. Don't worry about how it can sound or how it sounds. 

00:47:55
KATHY BOHN I, ah, uhm, okay I guess I'll start from the beginning. 

00:48:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:48:00
KATHY BOHN  I met a guy. 

00:48:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
KATHY BOHN Went to a party, with a friend of mine, it's a friend of mine's house. He was really nice, we, it was late in the evening it was toward 10 o'clock, and we've been talking now for about an hour and things had been going okay I, I really enjoyed him. He was a student at a nearby school where I... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
KATHY BOHN I'm a student. I'm a junior in college and we were talking, and we had a great conversation. We had some ah, a couple of glasses of wine each but, you know, I was perfectly capable of, you know, having a conversation, and the party was getting near at end well, it's probably more close to eleven now and we've been talking and he said, "Well, you know, do you wanna go walk?" (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:48:40
KATHY BOHN It was kinda, kinda stuffy... (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:48:45
KATHY BOHN Yeah, I mean I understood that there was a lot of smoke. I'm not really fond of smoke and so we took a walk and, and I just mentioned to my friend that I was going out and so she knew and, and we, I proceeded to walk outside and he just seemed you know, very nice. I, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
KATHY BOHN and uhm, he happened to live nearby and he said will you, do you want to come over, and I said, "Well, yeah. Okay... (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Sure. 

00:49:05
KATHY BOHN ..sure, why not," and uhm, said, "You know, maybe we can have a couple of drinks and we talk there." And I said, "Okay, that, that sounds, that sounds good". And so we proceeded to walk to his place and he's very nice and, you know, we talked about his family. I shared little about me but, and now and myself in, in college and, we got to his place and he offered me a glass of wine and I sat down the couch and, and we, we started talking and, and just like we had at the party. It was very, it was very, uhm, very nice, it was just, just a very nice situation. You know, I, I guess I was attracted to him, he was, he was good-looking and, (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
KATHY BOHN and, and I thought maybe you know, he was attracted to me and, there might be something that uhm, would occur, you know? It was, it was going well, and we, again we're talking and sipping wine and, and you know, and then he kinda got closer to me and, and I felt comfortable with that, I mean, you know, I've gotten to know him, I, I felt maybe. And, and then, and then he kissed me and that was nice and we are, we were kissing for a couple of minutes or so and, and then he put his hand on my shoulder and, and, and pulled me closer... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
KATHY BOHN  and that was, that was okay. I mean, I was, I was comfortable and then I was thinking, well, you know, I, I, I don't wanna go as much further. I, I just you know, (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:50:35
KATHY BOHN he's very nice, I just wanna take it slow at this time, I mean this, this sort of relationship and, and so I said, oh, you know, and I, I, I kind of pulled away a little bit and, and he proceeded to, you know, to kiss me again, and I said, well, you know, can we just, can we just hold up a bit. I just, you know, can we talk some more and I wanna get to know you some more. And he just, he was very, no, no, he want, he want to kiss me. He wa, he, you know, he wanted more and I, I just didn't, I didn't want that. 

00:51:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
KATHY BOHN And he commented, he said, oh, you're so pretty and, you know and, and that's nice, and now, and I was, will be taken in by that. I don't know, he was like, oh, you look so beautiful tonight and, and your hair, and, and why don't you take your hair down? I mean, what does you hair look like when it's down? It was up, just like it is now, and, and uhm, he was very, he was very warm, I, I guess, maybe, and he kept on complimenting me. Oh, you're so pretty and, and you know, and oh, I, you know, I'd really, I'd really wanna get to know you, I, I really, I really like you Kathy. I really, really feel strong you know and, and I was, I was okay at that, at that time but he, then he proceeded to kiss me again and I, and I just didn't, I, I felt like I didn't want that in, in there. (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
KATHY BOHN  I don't know what happened. 

00:51:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN You're feeling uncomfortable taking about it anymore, Kathy? 

00:51:55
KATHY BOHN  No, I mean, (sighs) I was scared at first to tell anybody about it and I, finally, I told my, I guess I did tell my friend. I wanna, I wanna tell you but it just, it hurts a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
KATHY BOHN Because it, it, it's something that I feel, (sighs) sort of my fault. 

00:52:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kathy, as I sit here and listening to you, I can't help but think that you've become a victim of a date rape, and I don't know if it's any consolation to you or not but I've sat here with other young women who have the same experience, who experienced the same pain, and feeling disgusted, sort of feeling, and I just wanna reassure that you want to continue talking. 

00:52:40
KATHY BOHN Yeah. I've, I did feel alone at certain points and I feel a little more comfortable now that you've, can share with me, you've shared feelings with other women who've been in my situation. I feel like I can go on. 

00:53:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, why don't you then, why don't you continue then? Kathy and I would like now to talk to the audience, and I feel that I would like to tell the audience that Kathy is an actress, but what I'd like Kathy to talk about is how she felt, even as an actress, about the dialogue that we were having. 

00:53:15
KATHY BOHN It was very difficult. I felt very much that it was happening to me and that I was living, I was living such an experience. I was scared. My emotions were there. I was nervous, not so much to what I was gonna say, but just how I'd react. 

00:53:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
KATHY BOHN 'Coz I haven't been in a situation like this. 

00:53:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN How did you feel of that, ah, my, my responses, or my questions to you? How did you feel about those? 

00:53:45
KATHY BOHN  I felt a little alone at some points, and I felt that I needed some more support from you at, before I went into the graphics. 

00:53:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:53:55
KATHY BOHN That I would need to know that you had been there, or you at least, listened to other women with my experience. 

00:54:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think that's very helpful. Let me share how I was feeling as I'm not quite sure ah, whether I was invading your space or, or, or in my, in my, on my own struggle as to ah, sharing with you some experience and ah, I felt later on, I felt more comfortable and, and realized that you needed the support from me, that I was hanging in there with you, and that ah, that I cou, that I was listening to you. 

00:54:30
KATHY BOHN Uh hmm. I felt that too. 

00:54:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, one thing that I was wondering is ah, did you feel that was important to ah, describe or depict what was happening? I was questioning that myself. 

00:54:45
KATHY BOHN It was important, I think, to an extent but it, it doesn't like, I mean, I doesn't mean this has applies to every situation. It applied to a situation I had, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
KATHY BOHN had visualized in my mind that might, might occur. It doesn't mean that this is happening to, to women out there. It doesn't mean that this is, I mean, an exact situation. It could be a different, could be a different setting. It could be something very different and I was just trying to depict something that, that would give me a feeling of uncertainty and. 

00:55:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, at least, from what I'm hearing, you're saying is that, each situation may be different but there is the need for a support during that crisis. When you're coming on a crisis like that, that the most important thing that the therapist or the counselor can do is, is make the client feel that they're supportive, that they're with them, and that they're willing to not ah, either, if they need to be probed, the probe, but if not, then back off. And so to some extent, a counselor needs to go with their own good instincts that ah, that ah, come after a certain round of experience of working in a crisis center. 

00:55:50
KATHY BOHN That's, that's true, very much true. 

00:55:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I thank you very much, Kathy, for, for your very graphic and, and, and extremely ah, I think, fine portrayal and I hope that it will be helpful to some of you who are ah, going to be working in crisis centers over the next few years.

Case Study #6 Men and Feminist Therapy Allen Ivey Mary Bohn Norma Gluckstern 

00:56:10
ELIZABETH BOHN  Feminist Therapy is too often thought of is, just for women. Men need to become experts in the concepts as well. Naked profit, as clients and male therapists need to understand, the main principles of Feminist Therapy. While men obviously, will have real difficultly in reaching full confidence in Feminist Therapy, we believe some knowledge of basic feminist concepts is necessary. Let us see a demonstration of a training session in which a man might learn how to be more effective in counseling women. In the following demonstration, Allen will again counsel a woman. The issue will be sexual harassment on the job. Norma Gluckstern will serve as coach and alter ego. Note how Norma conducts the training by both supporting his learning, and by acting as an alter ego. 

00:57:10
ALLEN IVEY  Hi, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
MARY BOHN Hi. 

00:57:15
ALLEN IVEY can you tell me what you'd like to talk about today? 

00:57:15
MARY BOHN Ah, well Allen, a lot of things have been happening on the job that really make me feel uncomfortable and I, you know, I, I just don't think I'm respected as a professional. 

00:57:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
MARY BOHN Ah, for example, ah, you know, we're hiring the person to be working with in the next year and, and I talked to my boss about the, I would really very much like to be on the hiring team, to be part of the selection process, be able... (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
MARY BOHN ...to select that person, and he really just denied me that right, didn't even listen to my ideas about that, you know, I just felt totally, you know, ignored and overlooked, and, and not respected as a professional, you know I had an opinion about that. 

00:57:55
ALLEN IVEY So you felt overlooked and ignored, and kind of angry, is that right? 

00:58:00
MARY BOHN Yeah. I really was. I was angry that uhm, my opinion as a professional wasn't, was just being ignored and he wasn't even paying attention to me. And by the way, a number of the people on that hiring team were men and I, I just felt that ah, particularly, since I'd be working with this person, then I should be there and, and, and I had a pretty strong opinion about that, what should be happening. 

00:58:20
ALLEN IVEY It's something that's very, very important to you. 

00:58:20
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. It really is. It really was. 

00:58:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I wonder, Allen, at this point where, from a feminist point of view, I might have focused in on her professionalism. (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN 'Coz it seems, what she's trying to, what she's trying to say to you is that somehow as a woman, (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I'm not being viewed as a professional. 

00:58:35
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:58:35
ALLEN IVEY I, I was trying to reflect feelings and listening, and I really should, just take a little stronger voice in terms of where professionals, is that right, Norma? 

00:58:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I think that that's the, the issue in, in the eyes when it's a woman. (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I could pick that up immediately that what her concern was, Well, I'm a professional and somehow because I'm a woman, he's not treating me as a professional. 

00:58:55
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
ALLEN IVEY  So some of the traditional listening skill that should be worked on so much can be then detect themselves through senses(ph). 

00:59:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I don't know whether ah, maybe it's selective hearing. 

00:59:05
ALLEN IVEY Selective hearing, uh-huh. Selective attention, we call it in the book, uh-huh, okay. So what I should do is again, ah, really try to focus in more on her feelings about professionals and a little less on the, the thoughts about professionals, and less on the feelings. 

00:59:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I think so, at least from my perspective, perhaps Mary might ah, join in. (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. No, I, I, you know, I think that I was thinking about, I wanted to be myself as a professional and, and that was exactly what I was getting at. So that's it. (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
ALLEN IVEY So we had better leave than be, I'll try this one. So you feel that you're ah, boss isn't treating you in a professional way, Mary, is that right? 

00:59:40
MARY BOHN That's right, and I've been in this school system now for, going on to 12 years, and I think I've demonstrated in a number of ways the way I am a professional and, and I ... (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
MARY BOHN ...guess that ah, to overlook me in, in a critical point like this, and this isn't the first time, and this is just one of many instances... (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
ALLEN IVEY  So being a woman... (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
MARY BOHN ...I feel its discriminatory. 

01:00:00
ALLEN IVEY So being a woman, you almost feel like you're being discriminated because you're... (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
MARY BOHN Right. 

01:00:00
ALLEN IVEY you're just a woman, is that right? 

01:00:05
MARY BOHN Uhm, that he doesn't respect me, ah, my opinion. He would, he, he has selected men to be on this interviewing team. And, ah. (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
ALLEN IVEY Right. Now I wanna ask you one question at this point, (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

01:00:15
ALLEN IVEY Norma. Ordinarily I would again just sort of paraphrase and reflect that back. You at this point, from, what some of the things you've been saying it might be better if I sort of say, "What are the, some, some of the strengths to validate her more as a person. Could you elab, is that, would that have been useful at this point? 

01:00:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think it would be more useful to go along the road of validation because I think... (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:00:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...she has achieved. She is a, (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN she has a position in this school and that this is a, this is really the problem for her... (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and that I don't think she needs to explore other avenues so much as... (crosstalk) 

01:00:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...giving her the feeling that she is the professional that she is and then where'd she go from here. So I think you're right on when you say that what you wanna really do is to validate her. It's. (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, this sort of, ah, more coming from, at least some of the time, I like, come from more (inaudible ) tradition. (crosstalk) 

01:01:01
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

01:01:01
ALLEN IVEY It means I need to be a little more active. I also need to be valid, active from a point of view how a woman might be discriminated against. Is that right? 

01:01:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think it's very, I think that's right. I haven't thought of those terms... (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
ALLEN IVEY Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:01:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...but a little bit more directive really. It's what you're saying. 

01:01:10
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:01:10
ALLEN IVEY Okay. So then to try that out, so Mary to get where you are, you obviously have a lot of strengths and made you feel you're not having listened. I think I need to hear about some of those things you've done to get where you are. Some of those things you see you have that you are good. Is that better? 

01:01:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think I feel... (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
MARY BOHN Hmm. 

01:01:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...it was better. 

01:01:25
MARY BOHN Well, I do think that I have made a, ah, a strong contribution to the school system. (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
MARY BOHN I have, uhm, now I have, I published my books and extended my own work beyond the school system to be working in the college level and, and teaching, and, uhm, extent, extensive other work. Uhm, you know, I, I just think that, and it's been, ah, shown through a number of year and through the years that I have been able to, to do these kinds of things. (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. And the thing is I can't help but go back as, as you're talking like that, I guess I sense you feel frustrated, a little angry in terms of not being treated with full respect for the things you are, have to offer. Is that right? I can imagine that would be... (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
MARY BOHN Yeah. 

01:02:05
ALLEN IVEY ...being sensitive, I mean. (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I think... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
MARY BOHN Yeah. 

01:02:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...you're focusing in on those things but, ah, at this point I'd probably have to check it out with Mary. 

01:02:15
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:02:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think that Mary actually is ready to solve a problem that she is, what she's coming for is "how do I handle my boss? How am I going to take a proactive stand." (crosstalk) 

01:02:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:25
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:02:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so I think at this point the, her sense of self is there. (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:30
MARY BOHN Yeah. 

01:02:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And the next thing is to give here the encouragement to take it to the next step. (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
ALLEN IVEY  Oh, so I guess the obvious... (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Hmm. 

01:02:35
ALLEN IVEY ...question is so, Mary, what would you like to do about? What's your goal? What do you wanna have happened as we... (crosstalk) 

01:02:40
MARY BOHN My goal is, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:02:40
ALLEN IVEY ...sometimes say. 

01:02:40
MARY BOHN I would like to be able to be more of an influence and, and let my professionalism be seen and, and heard in the school system, and I would like to for just in this one example, I would like to be very much be on this interviewing team. I think I should be and I, I think I have a right to be. That's just one example, and there's, there's just been so many leading up to that kind of thing and, (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:00
MARY BOHN uhm, I just want to be recognized... (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
ALLEN IVEY So, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:03:00
MARY BOHN  for the contribution. (crosstalk) 

01:03:05
ALLEN IVEY one question that occurs to me is that have you sat there being waited to be recognized or have you gone out and asked more actively to get what you wanna have happened? 

01:03:15
MARY BOHN Well, I guess it's harder to go out. I mean that's, part of my problem is "how do you go out and, and get that? How do you be more proactive... (crosstalk) 

01:03:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:20
MARY BOHN ...in this, to make this kind of happened. I'd, it's, sometimes I guess I wait, by doing a job, and just by... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
MARY BOHN ...being confident, I think that people should recognize me, and... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
MARY BOHN ...maybe I should be more proactive and, ah, maybe more political I guess one might say... (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:35
MARY BOHN ...rather than just by being, doing a good job that just, ah, doesn't seem to be enough. You have to be able to take that step a step further. 

01:03:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, so let me do something a little risky here, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:03:45
ALLEN IVEY  a lot of times men are trained to be proactive. 

01:03:50
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:03:50
ALLEN IVEY  And women historically have sat back. Again it's changing I guess that women... (crosstalk) 

01:03:55
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:03:55
ALLEN IVEY  as a woman little bit become stronger. I know, also you might wanna check out this lead with you, ah, but then it sounds to me like maybe you need to, ah, assert yourself and feel... (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:04:10
ALLEN IVEY ...that, it's one of the things that you is that, is that all close. 

01:04:15
MARY BOHN I think so. I think that I probably haven't asserted myself quite enough. I've just sort of done a... (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:20
MARY BOHN ...very good job and gotten recognition along the way but I haven't really taken at that next step to make sure that things happen because of this good job. 

01:04:25
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:04:25
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:04:25
ALLEN IVEY  Now as you talk to me I noticed that you sometime look up at Norma. Ah, what's going on here? (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, well ah, I, ah, no, I think you're doing a very good job, and now I think I would, ah, ah, push a little harder and say... (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:04:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  well, what's getting in your way? 'Coz it seems to... 

01:04:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:04:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...that what's happening is it's... (crosstalk) 

01:04:40
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:04:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...Mary right now is getting her own way and that maybe get her to identify what's preventing her from going forward. Could your touch, touching on it... (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:04:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and I think it is... (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...part of the socialization process, and we've got to get her over that... (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
ALLEN IVEY All right. 

01:04:55
MARY BOHN Okay. 

01:04:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...so that it made a more personal thing that's getting in her way. 

01:05:00
MARY BOHN It probably is a more personal kind of thing. It's, ah, gets a little bit of shyness and... (crosstalk) 

01:05:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:00
MARY BOHN ...uncomfortableness and, and it's not my nature to be so assertive and to push myself. (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:05
MARY BOHN Uhm, but, yet, I look at other people I realize that unless I do this, unless I push... (crosstalk) 

01:05:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:10
MARY BOHN ...myself a bit that, and, and get out there and speak my opinion that, that this is the kind of thing that happens... (crosstalk) 

01:05:20
ALLEN IVEY You're right. 

01:05:20
MARY BOHN ...that this has continued to happen to me. (crosstalk) 

01:05:20
ALLEN IVEY And so I, I would think that one thing I would like to as a man, as a man is validate your confidence. 

01:05:25
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
ALLEN IVEY And I think you can do it. Obviously you've done a lot or you wouldn't be where you are, and I, (crosstalk) 

01:05:30
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:05:30
ALLEN IVEY I like the way you with clarity. You seem kinda cross here your re, reasonably assertive. Ah. (crosstalk) 

01:05:35
MARY BOHN And if I could do that with my boss that would really be good. (laughs) 

01:05:35
ALLEN IVEY Well, now one thing that you of course could do at this point is bring it in and we could go through the more systematic assertiveness training program. 

01:05:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

01:05:45
ALLEN IVEY Would that be appropriate at this point... 

01:05:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think, (crosstalk) 

01:05:45
ALLEN IVEY ...as part of this? 

01:05:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think that you are getting remarkably good. (crosstalk) 

01:05:45
MARY BOHN It's probably. 

01:05:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I think one of things that, that struck me as you were talking is that in having a male counselor, you did help validate her and that she was being assertive in front of a male and nothing... (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:05:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...was really happening, and in that sense I think that's a real advantage over having a female counselor and, ah, and I think you're ready to, to get her to move on... (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...because I think she can move on. 

01:06:05
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
ALLEN IVEY There's, another thing that's going on here too. Well, that is that the fact that there's two women working with one man it switch the, switches the usual sex role thing that's goes on in a lot of counselor and therapist training. It makes me, (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Submissive. (laughs) 

01:06:15
ALLEN IVEY my submission (laughs) much more willing(ph). I think I'd better listen 'coz I'm outnumbered. (laughs) But I think that in a sense, you know, that a lot of our theories have been written by, like, ah, all of the major theories are written by men. Now we have... (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY ...feminist theory coming on... (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY ...and I think it's, ah, I think women are going to probably have to get in situations like these to help people like me and other men learn to deal with these issues. Is, is that... (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
ALLEN IVEY ...somewhere... (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:06:40
ALLEN IVEY ...on target? 

01:06:40
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right, it's very good and I think that, ah, it's, ah, it would be good to get to the part where a male and females can help each other... (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:06:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...in counseling and this is the sort of thing that sensitizes both of us or all of us to these, to these problems. 

01:06:50
MARY BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:06:50
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, I find I'll just say a little bit about this... (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
MARY BOHN True. 

01:06:55
ALLEN IVEY ...experience is that that I'm through it and that is that there's a lot of quick powerful feedback here. I am on video. (laughs) Norma(ph) at the back me, and Mary over there giving me feedback, and sitting there it, it's been interesting to me, I've, I maybe reflect various feeling that she looks to Norma rather than to me, and that's, that's a message I think that, ah, a lot of men out there in TV land need to get is that we need to look to women as experts to teach some aspects of counseling we've been missing. 

01:07:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, thank you, I wanna stop... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
MARY BOHN Thank you. 

01:07:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...with that. (laughs) 

01:07:25
MARY BOHN (laughs) Thank you.

Feedback System Case Study #7 Interview With Norma Gluckstern Norma Gluckstern Elizabeth Bohn 

01:07:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Norma Block Gluckstern is among the original founders of the Everywoman's Center located at the University of Massachusetts. I'd like to interview her and talk about the development of Feminist Therapy and how it relates to women's careers. Norma, you've been widely recognized for your contributions to the increasing role of women in the professions. Can you tell us about your present job? 

01:08:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I'd like to feel that I haven't once in, as a matter of fact the, ah, evolving roles of women. My job is somewhat interesting now because I'm a warden of a maximum security penal(ph) prison and, ah, that's somewhat unusual for a woman, ah, to do that, ah, and I, I think there are some problems that I experience as a woman in an all-male environment. They're a little bit more intense than some other women are experiencing as they're going up the professional ladder, and, uhm, probably the biggest problem that I find is it's a very directive society I'm in, and, ah, I think I never thought of myself as being that directive, ah, that somehow women didn't give orders, ah, and, ah, here I am in a semi, you know, military environment where I, uhm, need to give orders. I need to make decisions and, and, and I do that. It, I would sort of thinking about it as I was coming up here today thinking about this. I had a major crisis in the institution, and really I was the one that was sort of in charge. I was the one that was telling this people how to get ready for the press, ah, what steps we had to take with the police and so forth, and, ah, I kinda was smiling to think that I had actually arrived at a point where I knew other people and they were all men. 

01:09:20
ELIZABETH BOHN Being in this major management position that you're in, it's not typical for many women. How did you come this far? 

01:09:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, before I go back historically, I'd like to add one thing about the last... (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

01:09:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...question that I have found that the hardest thing for me to do is a woman in a top management position is to, ah, get angry at a man. (laughs) It's hard enough to get angry at women but if you get angry at a man, there's some dynamic that takes place if you're a woman and that dynamic is that somehow they think their mother is yelling at them. (laughs) And I feel I oughta share that because... (crosstalk)

ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm.

NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...that is probably the biggest learning I had and that when that happens, ah, we all sort of cringe. Now we arrived at a relationship so that when I get angry ah, in my relationship, the trust with my staff is pretty good but I wouldn't say that though, as you go up the ladder and you have to make these decisions and you're a woman and it's a slightly different reaction when a woman gets angry at a man than when a man gets angry with a man.

ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. Feminist Therapy as well as other theories of helping vary with the orientation of the therapist. The effective Feminist Therapy draws on ideas from other orientations of helping, humanistic, behavioral, and psychodynamic, but always considers these theories from the feminist perspective. You're making a solid beginning towards a feminist perspective if you engage in the five key behaviors and attitudes of Feminist Therapy. One, Egalitarian relationship as opposed to hierarchical control. Two, use of community resources as compared with emphasis on intrapsychic structure. The feminist therapist is, is particularly aware of social contacts. Three, active participatory counseling style to replace the objective silence and reflective techniques of much current helping. Four, information giving. There is a strong psycho-educational and instructive role in feminist helping. It is critical that women understand how their sex affects their being. And five, personal validation to enable women to realize that they are unique valuable persons. We hope this tape provides you some ideas about Feminist Therapy and its role for the future. Indeed, we are facing a different voice in the helping field: a woman's voice of relationship. This voice has profound implications for men as well. The helping field will be different in ten years due to the influence of Feminist Therapy and awareness.
