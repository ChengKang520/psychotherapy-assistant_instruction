ISAAC PRILLENLTENSKY  Okay, when I open my mouth, I know what people are thinking. Where is he from? He's funny accent. So, I'm gonna tell you. I'm from the South. Okay, the deep South. I'm from Argentina. I was born in Argentina. I grew up in Cordova. Then I lived for many years in Israel. Then, in Canada. Then, in Australia. And now I live in the U.S. in the real South. I live in Nashville. I work at Vanderbilt University. Eh, what I did, I took a community research in action, a Ph.D. program and I'm very pleased to be here. And when Derald was introducing me, I was thinking, yeah, I'm trying to ask the Department of Human Services to be more empowering. "Huh, good luck," I said. And I will talk a little bit about my applied work because it's really difficult to do when you work with a large bureaucracy. Huh, how do you make them more apply? How do you make them more empowering, more social justice-oriented? How do you apply all these principles? It's a big challenge. So, I'd like to say a little bit about research, values, but also the action part. I believe there is a lot to be said about why psychology and counseling and education, support the status quo and support an unjust state of affairs, and my writing has done a lot of documenting of that. But I also think it's important to try and move us forward. How can we become immersed in mainstream institutions and try to move them forward towards a more social justice-oriented type of practice. So, I'm foolish enough to think that I can make a difference. So, I'll be talking about that as well. Okay, so, let's start. And I'd like to start with a little story. The story is the story of the Grameen Bank because it's a very empowering, social justice kind of story. You may not know this person but this individual is Muhammad Yunus. Muhammad Yunus came from Bangladesh to Vanderbilt University, my school, in the late '60s to study Economics. And he had the foolish idea that whatever he was going to learn in Vanderbilt was going to help him improve the Bangladeshi economy. So, after he obtained hi, his Ph.D. from Vanderbilt, he went back to Bangladesh to the University of Chittagong, and he realized, to his dismay that all these Western economic progress stuff didn't work very well in Bangladesh. So, what did he do? He went to the villages, and he started asking people what do they need in order to improve their lot in life. And many of the people said, "Look, we are indebted for life because we're trying to make a living, we take loans to start little businesses, carpentry, crafts, whatever we can grow and sell." But there were loan sharks who really imposed incredible interest rates on really miniscule loans. So, these people were always repaying loans. They could never make progress. They could never make a liv, a decent living. So, Muhammad Yunus said, "What if I lend you money without interest? What if I lend you money with very, very, very little interest? And you have time to repay it when you can." So, he started micro-credit. And, you wouldn't believe it, but he had $27 and he distributed $27 among 42 women. So, he gave them less than a dollar each. And the women began their own little enterprises. And once they were freed from these loan sharks, they began to thrive. And they began to could, prosper economically, and then the bank grew. And now the bank, the Grameen Bank, has five million people. And it's run as a cooperative. And the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh is now into health corporations. They build hospitals. They are into I.T. They give eh, cellular phones to women in remote villages, and these are the phone ladies. And it's a business that they developed. What's the story here about empowerment? Not only did he work with poor women in the villages, he worked with homeless people in the cities. Muhammad Yunus wanted to prove that you can work with the poorest of the poor. And these people, if they're given a decent chance, if they can have a little more control over their lives, they would use the chance. A lot of people mocked Yu, Muhammad Yunus because they thought well, these people are never going to repay their loans. Ninety-nine percent of the people returned the loans. It's one of the banks in the world with the highest rate of return for the loans. He was fighting a great bureaucracy. No bank wanted to support Muhammad Yunus because everyone thought he was a fool. Poor people don't pay loans. Well, not only did he show they pay loans. They can go on and be responsible business owners. And I think it's a very inspiring story. It shows that once you free people from the chains of indenture which is what they were experiencing before, people can thrive. So, I'm going to come back to the story of the Grameen Bank a few times because it's a really important and inspiring one. So, let's go to the next slide. And I want to talk before I get to empowerment and social justice, I want to talk about well-being. So, what is well-being? That's where, where it all starts. Well-being is a positive state of affairs brought about by the simultaneous satisfaction of personal, relational, and collective needs of individuals and communities. So, if we go to the next slide, please. And you can, here again. There cannot be well-being but in the combined presence of personal, relational and collective well-being. We cannot just foster individual thriving, individual well-being in the absence of positive nurturing relationships and all of those happen in a context, in the context of collective well-being. So, let me tell you a few words about each one of those components. So, if we can go to the next slide please. Eh, what's personal well-being? Personal well-being is about having a sense of control, physical health, love, optimism, competence, dignity and integrity, growth and self-esteem. So, why on earth do I have a picture of somebody playing chess there. Well, the fellow is to be my son in Harvard Square. Matan(ph) drives a lot of his sense of control, optimism and competence in life through playing chess. He just happened to be the master of Harvard Square. The master was very annoyed of my son that he had lost. But what am I showing here? Individuals need a sense of competence. That they, they are good at something. That they can control their environment. In the case of eh, my son, chess provides a wealth of opportunities for him to feel competent, to compensate for many other things in which he is not so great just like the rest of us. So, if we go to the next ones, please? Now, we all know that sense of control is very important in life, so I want to show you a longitudinal study conducted by Michael Marmot, it's called the Whitehall Studies. And what did Michael Marmot do? As you can see on the slide, eh, there are four occupational groups. He followed up 25,000 people over a, a decade and a half. These are British civil servants, people working for the British government. And he divided them into this four occupational groups, administrators, professional workers like psychologists, social workers, economists, clerical workers and unskilled labor called here in the graph, other workers. It turns out that after you control for smoking, cholesterol levels, lifestyle, drinking, all the possible physical measures that you can imagine would deter, determines the risk of death is people's report of having a sense of control over their lives. And as it turns out, the lower you are on the occupational status, the higher the risk of death. If you happened to be an unskilled laborer, the guy who delivers the mail, or the janitor, chances are that person will die, those, that group has four times chances of dying higher than the people who are the bosses. This is called the social gradient. The social gradient applies to levels of diabetes, depression, teenage pregnancy, child abuse and a host of psychosocial problems. The lower you are on social class, the higher those problems will occur in a perfectly nice eh, gradient fashion, including people who are professionals in Sweden. Males in Sweden who have BAs have a higher chance of dying early than those who have an M.A., and those with an M.A. have a higher chance than those who have a Ph.D. So, there is something here about the status syndrome as Michael Marmot calls it. The lower you are on status, the more out of control you feel, the more envious that you feel of other people who have a better lot than you, better lot in life. In this case, we're looking at lack of control. The lower the amount of control you have, the more, the sicker you get, okay. So, we can go to the next slide, please? And a similar phenomenon takes place in Norway when you ask, a, a friend of mine conducted this study in eh, Oslo based on a longitudinal study of nearly 19,000 people. The lower you are, category five on the occupational scale, the higher the levels of health, the stress that people report. So, that's not surprising. So, let's move on, please. So, what about relational well-being? Well, support, affection, bonding, cohesion, collaboration, these are the kinds of things people tell u, that tell us that make for relational well-being. I want to be nurtured, supported, appreciated. So, if we go to the next slide, please? Eh, what are some of the effects of social support, for instance? We know that feeling nurtured and appreciated and supported by other people eh, all those things have very tangible effects on your health. People with more social support are less likely to have heart attacks, more likely to survive cancer, more likely to resist the common cold virus, et cetera, et cetera. So, these are very well documented eh, facts. So, if we go to the eh, slide please? I just wanna show a picture of my relational well-being. So, this is a picture of Aura, my wife, with my son and they provide the kind of relational well-being that I need to thrive. So, Aura just left the room a few minutes ago. So, she would have hear me, hate for doing this. I'm glad she's not here. Okay. We can go to the next slide, please? Now, what about social capital. Social capital is that phenomenon by, coined by Bourdieu and was very well popularized in the U.S. by Robert Putnam. Social capital relates to the thickness of your social networks. The more connected you are to other people in civic groups, like a bowling eh, group or a church, or a political party or a hockey club. The better connected you are, the higher the social capital. Now, in the U.S. you can measure everything, so Putnam did. So, he measured social capital throughout the century across different states and what he found was that states with high social capital like North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Minnesota, they do much better on health, welfare, education tolerance and states with low social capital like my state of Tennessee do much worse on crime. So, this is a very telling eh, picture that demonstrates that social support, when you are connected to other people, the positive effects flow not only for yourself, but also for the entire community. So, the more connected you are to civic endeavors, the better the outcomes for everybody. And it is well-known that Vermont and Minnesota are two of the better states for children in the country. Okay. So, there is something about connecting that benefits not only the person being connected, but also the environment as a whole. Okay, so let's move on. Now, what about collective well-being? Collective well-being has to do with social justice, liberation from oppressive forces, adequate health and social services, adequate housing, et cetera, et cetera. And this is not surprising. You all know that. But let's go to the next slide and let me talk for a minute about male life expectancy by inequality. I don't know if you are familiar with the concept of the Gini, but the Gini is an economic construct that measures social inequality. The higher the Gini coefficient of a country, the higher, the bigger the gap between the rich and the poor. Countries with a low Gini means that there is a wide middle class. So, examples of high eh, low Gini eh, countries are Sweden and Japan. And you can see that male life expectancy there is nearly 78. And it goes down, the more unequal the country is. And in the U.S., which is one of the coun, the rich countries with the highest Gini, you can see that life expectancy goes down. Okay, let's move to the next slide, please? So, if you would just wanna press once more, please? Thank you. So, wha, that was about the research about well-being. What do we know about personal, relational, and collective well-being. I spoke about the research documenting the correlates and the sources of well-being in those three domains, what about the values for well-being? Well, I maintain that we need to promote values for personal, relational and collective wellness at the same time. And you can see list there of the values that we need to reconcile. The middle column called Relational Wellness, I think it's very important because in, in modern political philosophy, there is usually a dichotomy between liberalism and communitarianism. And despite, despite what they call in this country liberals, eh, liberalism is usually about defending the rights of the individual whereas collectivism is about promoting the well-being of the community as a whole. But I think what is not emphasized enough is the role of relational values which are supposed to breach between the needs of the individual and the needs of the collective. There is always a tension between what I want to pursue for myself and what my family needs and what the community needs and how much do I contribute to the social justice and the well-being and the environment, and how much of it do I contribute to my own eh, aspirations? There is always conflict. And the conflict needs to be mediated by a set of well-articulated, relational values. So, if we can move on, please? So, those values respond to needs. Self-determination respond to the needs for control, mastery voice and choice, that's my son playing chess. He needs to feel in eh, in control of the situation, that's his way of experiencing mastery. Caring and compassion, that was the picture I put of my family there providing caring for each other. Respect for diversity attends to the needs for identity and dignity. Collaboration attends to the need for participation and belonging. So on and so forth. So now, I think it's important to understand that all these values can be distorted, which I think is what happens in, in many places of the world. If you take the value of self-determination at the top of the middle column, this is eh, desirable value. It's one of the values that a most, eh, moral philosophers and ethicist and people concerned with well, well-being would support. This is what empowerment is all about. Self-determination. Having a sense of control over your life. But what happens when there is too much of it? When there is too much of it, empowerment gets distorted into individualism and when there is too little of it, empowerment eh, self-determination suffers so you experience oppression. When your autonomy is undermined by either a political regime like the one in Argentina when I left and settled in the States, or you, it's undermined by a people in relationships that are oppressive, like the situations of domestic violence. What about relational well-being? I think that social support can also be distorted. It can, it has been distorted in this country in eh, in recent history. When we're expecting churches, for instance, to pick up the slack for all the social justice and inequalities that there are in this country. This is what I call romantic social capital. Social capital is wonderful as I showed you before. But social capital cannot compensate for the lack of access to health care. These are two different things. And sometimes, we just get dogmatically focused on one solution to the problem. Now, of course, if there is too little social capital, people experience ah, exhalation and alienation. What about the collective values? Support for community is very important. But like my friends in Cuba tells, tell me, you know, we have to sacrifice so much for the government that our own sense of identity and personal aspirations are totally obliterated by the need to support the, the state's aspirations. So, you don't want a situation where your own aspirations are just overridden by the state. On the other hand, you don't want a situation where there is no support for the community whatsoever. So, I believe that what we need to do is reach a state of affairs where we can balance the values for personal, relational, and collective well-being. We have to keep them in good tension(ph), in good balance and we have to avoid the distortions that I'm showing you here. Let's move on, please. So, what is empowerment then? Empowerment for me is a value, a sign, a source and strategy for well-being associated with having control over your life, feeling respected, protecting your dignity and expressing voice and choice in personal and social affairs. And if we go over next slide, please? What Is Justice? Well, justice is again, a value, a sign, a source and strategy for well-being associated with the fair and equitable distribution of resources in society. Now, social justice has been traditionally defined as following: To each according to his or her due. Now, the problem is that how do we decide what is due a person, or a group? Right? That's a very big question. How do I decide what is due a person? The dominant ideology claims that ability and effort is what will get you the goodies. If you are really very smart or if you work very, very hard then you deserve it, right? You work hard, you get a raise, et cetera, et cetera. Well, I claim that in alternative ideology should also take into account the needs of individuals, the rights of individuals, the opportunities that you are presented with, as well as the power that you have to put into effect your good abilities. My son, the chess player whom you saw before, have lots of opportunities to develop, develop his abilities. And there is no reason why another kid growing up perhaps, in a poor community couldn't do as well or better than my son. But my son have lots of opportunities that were presented to him which other kids don't have. So, we must take into account opportunities and the power that people have, as well as the needs. So, let's go to the next question. Who or what is responsible for distributing resources and obligations? Well, the dominant ideology says, that the individual employer, with little or no government intervention to redistribute taxes or wealth. In Canada, where I lived for 15 years, the rich provinces like Ontario and Quebec used to pay more taxes so that the poor provinces like Prince Edward Island would not be so poor. So, interestingly enough, the, the poor, uhm, provinces in Canada had lesser levels of individual poverty than other places because there was an equalization. A transfer of payments from the rich to the poor. And this something that other countries should really consider. Now, the alternative ideology would say that it's, not just your employer who decides how much you should get paid, eh, or tax say, or, or government through some kind of, uhm, tax incentives. This is a job for family community governments. So, we need to expand the definition. So, if we go to the next one. I want to present a revised definition of social justice which says, "to each according to their needs, ability, effort, opportunities, rights and power, and from each according to their needs, ability, obligation, duties, opportunity and privilege." Privilege behooves us to distribute wealth and privilege also brings with it some duties. Okay, so let's go to the next slide. So, the context is really what should determine what criterion or criteria must be preferred in each case. In social conditions of inequality, we must accord preference to needs over ability. If there isn't an equal distribution of opportunities in society, before we get to ability, we have satisfy everybody's needs. In a context of plenty of opportunities for everyone, it is possible that ability and effort will be the preferred choice. So, the role of context is very important. We cannot dogmatically, eh, obsess on the criterion of ability when not everyone's needs have been equalized. When we have truly, truly a level playing field, then it's okay to say, "Isaac, you worked, you worked so much harder than the next person, you deserve to be rewarded." That's perfectly fine. Only, when we have all started at the same place and only when everybody's needs have been equally met. Well, this is not the state of affairs which we have now. So, basically, there is a disjuncture between the criterion that we want to dogmatically apply, which is ability and effort and the context in which we try to apply. Is that, this connection clear to the audience? You guys get it? Okay, so let's move on next. So, then there is a connection between empowerment and justice. You see on the right hand column, empowerment is enhanced, as I said before, by self-determination control in relationships, equality and freedom. Now, justice is enhanced and contributes to well-being, by the power, capacity, and opportunity to experience voice and choice, to experience nurturing relationships free of abuse and to benefit from fair and equitable distribution of resources and burdens. It's just not fair that only my son could be a chess champion. You have to develop that opportunity in all the kids, okay? So, now I get to the action part because I promised to say a few words about how do we try to implement those ideas in the real world. How do we try to spread the notions of empowerment and social justice in communities. And one way that we do this is through a project we call New SPECs and SPECs stand for Strength, Prevention, Empowerment and Changing unjust community conditions. So, that's an acronym for a project that we are working on. So, if we can go to the next slide, please? I want to tell you a little story about prevention, eh, (clears throat) and what you see there is a picture of me hugging a water pump. And you're asking yourself, "What are you doing there, Isaac?" This is a very important water pump that really illustrated the importance of community conditions in removing the sources of ill-health in a community. So, talking about water.

00:26:50
ISAAC PRILLENLTENSKY  In 1854, there was a cholera epidemic in London. People were dying like flies, and nobody know how to treat cholera. So, they called on John Snow. John Snow was a physician who, five years prior to that, had published a paper indicating that cholera was a water-borne disease. But nobody believed John Snow. He thought he was a wacko, nobody paid attention to his paper. Until five years later, there was a cholera epidemic and nobody knew what to do about cholera, so they called on John Snow. So, what did John Snow do? He had a map of London and he began putting a red dot next to the places where people were dying. And through detective work, he was able to discern that most people who were dying were drinking water from this water pump. So, he said, "I don't know how to treat cholera, but perhaps, I can help prevent it." So, what did he do? He ordered city officials on September 7th, 1854, to remove the handle from the water pump, and he stopped the cholera epidemic. And what, what do we learn from John Snow and his story about removing the handle? We have to get to the root causes of the problems. John Snow could not have cured the thousands of people who were dying of cholera, but he was able to detect by going to the root cause, what was causing the big problem. I may just parenthetically tell you that that big building that you see at the back there, is a brewery and that almost threw John Snow off because in the brewery people were not dying. And it turns out that the workers in the brewery had suspected that the water was contaminated and they only drank beer. So, when John Snow, these all, these mapping exercise, he saw, "How come people are not dying here?" Well, it turns out the workers knew something was not quite right. So, the story was that I took my sister I was, eh, a fellow of the British Psychological Association, I took my sister, she was living in Israel I said, "Come visit with me." So, I dropped her to the Broad Street Pump and I said, "You take a picture of me." And my sister had no idea until I told her the story. So, I want you to remember the story about the, the Broad Street Pump. And if we go to the next slide. Now, this is one of the things that we learned from that, eh, event. That no mass disorder, afflicting humankind, has ever been eliminated or brought under control by treating the affected individual HIV/AIDS, poverty, child abuse, powerlessness are not eliminated one person at a time. There will never be enough of you or enough of me to cure all the people who are affected by the detrimental societal conditions. We need to get to the root cause, just like John Snow did. Okay, so, if you go next. What we're trying to do then is in my work, we're trying to change from, if we can go to the next, eh, here again. What we're trying to promote is a change from deficit-based to strength-based approaches from reactive to primary prevention, to professional-driven from empowerment, from individual orientation to community conditions. What Muhammad Yunus did, he went to the people and he said. People said, "I don't know what to do with the money. You are giving me a loan, I don't know how to use it." He convinced people they could make a living by being creative and taking a loan that he was all too willing to give. He convinced people, "You have skills." And he did outreach. Muhammad Yunus did not expect people to come to the bank in Bangladesh and say, "Can you please help me." He did outreach. He moved into the community and he tried to implement social justice, empowerment-oriented approaches in the villages. He was not an economist sitting behind the desk, he was an economist going out there to the villages. Just like John Snow tried to engage in primary prevention, that's what we are trying to do. Okay, so now, I need to make sense of all of the many different ways in which we, professional helpers do our job. So, what I did was to map out different quadrants. And first, I want to talk about the contextual field in the helping professions. Here, you have the horizontal continuum which is reactive to proactive, this is the timing of intervention continuum, and then you have the vertical axis, which goes from individual helping approaches to collective helping approaches. And you can see on quadrant one, here at the top, community development, affordable housing, recreational opportunities, high quality schools and health services. Those are examples of the intersection of proactive and collective interventions. And you can see each quadrant has representation of various helping orientations. Okay, now, what happens is that a lot of people do their work in quadrant three. And we need to try to have a balanced approach, sometimes people need to be in quadrant three, but sometimes we also need to move to quadrant two and quadrant one. Unfortunately, we have a lot of quadrant four in this country. We have big prisons. We have lots of food banks, and we have lots of shelters for homeless people. Okay, these are not solutions, okay. These are containment approaches. So, if we go to the next slide. I want to show you some research we did. In Canada and the U.S., when you compare treatment to, eh, prevention, 99 percent of the budgets of Departments of Health and Human Services, aging, community services, whatever they are called in different states, approximately 99 percent of the money goes towards rehabilitation. Only about one percent of the money goes towards finding the root causes of cholera like John Snow did. I think that will imbalance is really not a very acceptable state of affairs. Now, it used to be said, "How do you know prevention works?" You know, "What are you preventing?" If you prevent something, you never know that, how do you measure it? Well, that was about 20, 30 years ago, but it turns out that there is a lot of research now that shows, here on this slide, first of all, that when you invest in prevention through early childhood interventions, home visiting for mothers at risk, child-parenting centers, what the graph shows is that you get an economic investment because your dollars, when you invest a dollar in the Perry Pre-School Ypsilanti Program in Michigan, one of the model head start programs, you get for every dollar you invest, you get five in return because the children, who were the subject of cognitive stimulation when they were three years old, don't go as much to special education classes, they don't require as many psychological services, they do not become involved with the juvenile delinquent system as much. There are all kinds of benefits that accrue from having had early cognitive stimulation. The two middle programs are the programs by David Olds(ph) on the prevention of child abuse. These are (clears throat) the programs, eh, involving home visitors for young mothers at risk, about nine visits prenatally and 23 visits postnatally, where you work with young mothers about parenting, social support, skill training, job opportunities, et cetera. Whether you realize that you can reduce the level of child abuse from 20 percent of, for mothers in the control group, one out of five kids, to four percent, okay. Prevention works when it's properly done. This is the child parenting centers which is a comprehensive approach to helping children through family resources, home visiting, et cetera, et cetera. Prevention works. We need to do more of that. Now, so, just to make clear, I'm a teacher, so I'm not supposed to leave anything to your imagination. So, I put a big X where I think where we need to do more work. Okay, we can go to the next, eh, slide. And now, I talked before about the contextual field, time and space. Now, I want to talk about the affirmation field. For me, the affirmation field consist of two continua, one I called the participation continua, that's the empowerment one, and the vertical axis, I call the abilities continuum. We have to concentrate on strength and not only on deficits. So, once again, you see four quadrants here. Eh, and you see, for me, the most unfortunate quadrant about which we can do something is quadrant three, where many people are invested in the promotion of patienthood and clienthood instead of promoting citizenship. I found that situation intolerable. Everyone has strengths. We have to find people's strengths and build on that. Okay? Now, I think that it's very important, also on quadrant one, to enhance voice and choice in celebrating and building on competencies. Everyone has resilient seeds within them. We need to nurture them. We need to provide people with the appropriate dignity to recognize what they are doing well. Many of the people who are poor and marginalized in society, have incredible skills at surviving and coping and even thriving in the most deleterious conditions that there are. We need to learn from them. Now, I also find quadrant four, particularly, uhm, unappealing. This is Reagan's "Just Say No" approach to drugs. Okay? I call this cheerleading approaches. If you think hard you can do it, you will be able to do it. Okay? Just say no to drugs or just say no to sex. Okay? Well, if there ever was really a (inaudible ) approach or really, uhm, eh, a baseless, non-empirically validated way to change the world, that would be, "Just Say No to Drugs," okay. So, again, I'm a teacher and I don't want you to have misconceptions. So, I think we need to place a big X on the Strengths and Empowerment quadrant. Okay, let's move on. So, now I come to tell you a little bit about the project that we're doing, eh, in Nashville. This is, this is not the human services project I told you about. I just, eh, I'm concentrating here on a project with the united way of Nashville and other four organizations. Oasis Center at the top, is a youth organization, Bethlehem Center is a community center, where they do, uhm, they have, eh, (clears throat) early childhood education, after-school programs, job training, youth programs. United Neighborhood Health Services have eight clinics throughout Nashville for the uninsured and Martha O'Brien is a Presbyterian Church, uhm, community center. So, you have a nice Jewish boy working primarily with Catholic organization, Christian organizations, okay. So, we go to next, what are we trying to do? We're trying to promote the SPEC approach, Strength, Prevention, Empowerment and Changing unjust community Conditions through consultation and research, and we're doing consultation with these organizations on the processes. How to create effective and inclusive processes that achieve SPEC, Strength, Prevention, Empowerment, Changing unjust Conditions. Outcomes, we want to help them in identifying and achieving SPEC goals for each organization. And we're doing research. So, we're doing an intervention and we're researching both the processes and the outcomes of our intervention. And basically, our intervention, is we come to these organizations, I work with a team of graduate students, mostly doctoral and also masteral students. I work with some colleagues at Vanderbilt. And we go out to the community to these organizations and we established what we call, "T-Teams," Transformation teams. And within each organization, there are Vanderbilt consultants and researchers, and there are, the com, community people, as well as staff of these organizations, and we try to examine the policies and practices of each organization, and we basically ask the question. Are they SPEC like? Are they strength based or are you concentrating on pathology? Do you have a positive approach to evaluate people's conditions or are you into labeling and patienthood. We asked about the P. Are you promoting proactive approaches or are you just waiting in your office, waiting for people to come and say, "I've been a victim of this," or "I've been a victim of that." We do this kind of systematic approach. Okay, so, if we go to the next line. Eh, if you can hit twice, eh, once more? Thank you. So, we have, what are the structures? What systems do you, do we use to do this work in organizations? So, we have wha, what it said T-Teams. Those are teams that midweekly or biweekly, sometimes, twice a week, sometimes, three times a week to do this kind of work. We call them T-Teams. We have councils. We bring people from different levels of the organization to do problem solving, to create a new mission statement, to examine their policies and practices. We have affiliation groups, forums, workshops and training. We give conferences. We have task forces. What are the principles we use, principles of participation. We believe that every single person in the organization has to have a say about how are we going to move from deficit to strength, from reaction to proaction, et cetera, et cetera. Participation, power sharing, ownership, and meaning, this has to be meaningful to people. It should not just be a tokenistic exercise when you are invited to a meeting and people just go through the motions. And we pay a lot of attention to the process of engaging in a new philosophy. And what are the messages? The messages are that we want to promote SPEC, and the meaning of change process personally and professionally. We, we cannot do this work unless people feel they're completely bought into this, okay? And people will be bought into this if they identify with the message. It's not something that we, the Vanderbilt people, are laying on, on the organizations, the partners. We go through a lengthy pro, process of collaboration. And if we move to the next slide, please? So, I just wanna read you one of the mission statements that were reconstructed based on the SPEC work we did with Oasis Youth Center. And there, no mission statement, eh, that emerged out of this work was: In every act, in every interaction, in every social action, we hold each other accountable to promote people's dignity, safety, hope and growth. Relationships based on caring, compassion, and respect. Societies based on justice, communion and equality. We are all better when these values are in balance. To put these values into action, we will: Share our power, be proactive and not just reactive, transform the conditions that create problems for youth, encourage youth and families to promote a caring community, nurture visions that make the impossible possible. We commit to uphold these values with youth and their families, our employees, organization and community. And then we wrote, this is a living document. We invite you to discuss it, to critic it, to live it. It may look like just a nice piece of paper. But, it's much more than that in this organization. People went through a fourth-man process of having soliciting input from everyone in the organization, and their clients about what this organization should be about. People feel these words. People go to every meeting and they ask, how are we doing this in this meeting? It has become a little bit of a blue book or, eh, eh, a source, a guidance, a corrido for this organization. So, they are, these people feel these words. They really labored very hard to come up with it. Okay, so, if we move to the next line. I just want to give you an idea, I have another two minutes? 

00:44:45
 You have about a minute(ph).

ISAAC PRILLENLTENSKY Okay, so, I'm nearly done. I just want to give you an idea. You see a few variables, approaches to solutions, approaches to problems, view of community members and you see next to each variable, either an, an, S-P-E or C, we measure the SPEC and practices in each organization, and we want to be able to reach the SPEC line, and we are measuring longitudinally how well these organizations are changing in their assessment of problems, how well are they changing in the way they treat clients, are they having more voice and choice and so and so forth. So, our research is longitudinal. This was base line. We're doing now the midpoint, and in a year and half, we're doing the end. We wanna see whether we're making a difference. So, if we go to the next slide, please? I just have a couple more. I wanna give you, this is data from the United Way of Nashville which funds 166 projects. And I have permission from them to name them, so, this is why I'm, I'm naming my participants. And we wanted to know whether they were doing community empowerment or individual empowerment. And it turns out that 132 programs out of the 166 that they fund, they are individual focused. They want to promote empowerment, but they are not getting to the water pump that is contaminating the ca, eh, the, (clears throat) the community with a toxic environment. Okay? So, if we go to the next one, the same happen when we examined changing community conditions. It turns out that most of their programs are trying to change individuals one at a time. Just like the people before John Snow, we're trying to cure people with cholera one at a time. So, when we conduct some research and we see, are these people trying to promote changing community conditions? The answer is no. And I have two more slides. And I just want to tell you that my conclusion, it's all like Venice. And why is it like Venice? If we go to the next slide. Well, it's like Venice because the psychotherapist, social worker or social reformer, concerned only with his own clients and their grievance against society, perhaps takes a view comparable to the private citizen of Venice who concerns himself only with the safety of his own dwelling and his own ability to get about the city. But if the entire republic is slowly being submerged, individual citizens cannot afford to ignore their collective fate, because, in the end, they all drown together. Thank you very much.

  I just wanna thank to(ph), Isaac for the presentation he offer(ph), he does have, a conversation hour that follows directly after this. Ah, for some of you might like to have another ah, event to go to, you're free, ah, ah, to leave. But I'm just gonna let ah, Isaac handle it. 

00:48:00
ISAAC PRILLENLTENSKY Yes, ah, (clears throat) we have three more minutes for questions and answers. There maybe somebody who wants to ask a question and then you have to leave. We can have a, a one or two questions now, and then, we'll break. Whoever needs to leave, leave. Then, we stay behind. Are there any questions now or comments? Well, let's then break, and I'm gonna stay here and if anyone wants to chat, people are welcome to stay. Thank you very much.
