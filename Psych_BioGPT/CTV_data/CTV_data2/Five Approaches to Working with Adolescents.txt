SHANNON KELLOGG Welcome to 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents. In this video we'll review five key components of working with teens. The first and most important stage of working with an adolescent is building rapport. So this means building a strong trusting relationship with the teen and having a good working alliance. Next, we'll review with an adolescent who's struggling with depression and adolescent who's having difficulties with anger management and adolescent who's having trouble with anxiety. Lastly, we'll demonstrate how I work with the teen in a school setting. Even if you're not working directly in a school setting, we'll demonstrate how to work effectively with parents and teachers. When people ask me why I enjoy working with adolescents and kids, my answer is honestly that I genuinely like them and that's one of the most important aspects of working with this population is really liking who you're working with. So you know, getting along well with teenagers, being able to connect with younger people that's essential and it's not for everybody and that's okay. But for people who enjoy it and who love doing it, teenagers will really respond to that because they can tell us if you like them and that is the first and most important step of any working relationship. My experience has include a wide variety of settings over the past ten years in working with teens and adolescents thus, it include my post doctoral works supervising, ah, family and youth parent partnership program, working in a school setting, ah, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings, ah, with kids, adolescents and families. I've also taught at the college and graduate school level teaching courses of psychology, helping skills and introduction to psychotherapy and marriage and family counseling. 

00:02:15
Lucy Vail MFT 

00:02:15
LUCY VAIL I have really enjoyed working with adolescents for over 20 years even before becoming an MFT, I worked with adolescents in prevention in programs in Boston, in the public housing projects. We had groups of adolescents that met right within their own public housing project and we are able to use alternative interventions like art therapy, hatha yoga, meditation, music and to build resiliencies and promote a healthier lifestyle. Then as an MFT, I've worked with teens in a school setting, in and outpatient mental health clinic and also in day treatment for, uhm, with teens that had such severe emotional struggles that they weren't able to function in a traditional school setting. I think this is one of the most difficult stages in life, it's the streaky transition going from childhood to adulthood. And I guess I have a certain real compassion for this difficult stage and I really enjoy working with adolescents and helping them make this transition, uhm, successfully whatever that means for them into a healthy successful adulthood. My approach with adolescents is client centered and narrative. I think it's a critical first stage to spend time joining and building rapport with adolescents. And I do this by using unconditional positive regard, uhm, being nonjudgmental, being very present and genuinely curious with the adolescent and discovering-- being genuinely curious about their story and their unique perspective. 

00:04:00
Building Rapport 

00:04:05
LUCY VAIL This first section is building rapport or joining. We feel that this is the most important stage in working with adolescents. Don't you find that if this stage is not well attended to it's really hard to go anywhere else with the teen. 

00:04:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Yes, I do. It's very important the teen feels that you like them, that you're genuinely interested in what they have to say and that you really wanna understand their unique perspective so that's really important in the building process. Ah, what I do notice a teenager is talking about in terms of what might have gone wrong and other therapy situations, whatever you heard. 

00:04:35
LUCY VAIL Right. Well, the most common thing they don't like kind of cookie-cutter approaches but just remaining really genuine and open to this connection and being sensitive to whether they are there with you or not. 

00:04:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Absolutely, so one way that we might be able to avoid that is to give control the session to the clients in terms of asking them what they want to do, what they want to talk about, what they're interested in and being, being open to different approaches they're gonna work different with different teenager. So art for one teenager might be really effective in a great way of expressing themselves and for another teenager that might feel really childlike or might feel not comfortable for them. So kind of asking them just to what they think would be important during your time together can be a good way to kinda start. And saying that you've talked about is that curiosity and that sense of really being curious and open to adolescents. So what do you notice? 

00:05:25
LUCY VAIL A-- any of us can make a lot of assumptions about an asel-- adolescents as we can about anyone but we might make certain assumptions and that's a dangerous place to go, I think so really remaining very curious, genuinely curious about what their interests are, what their preferences are in life. 

00:05:45
Key Concepts for a Strong Working Alliance Humor 

00:05:45
SHANNON KELLOGG The humor that you use in therapy can be really effective. It kind of reduces the tension and so what have you notice about humor and how you can use that with teenagers? 

00:05:55
LUCY VAIL I mean, I, I feel like it kind of puts them at ease. 

00:06:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:06:00
LUCY VAIL Uhm, and builds that connection quickly. When they feel like it's work like it's homework or it's a chore or, uhm, you know, it's really hard to get in anywhere but a little bit of humor goes really long way. 

00:06:10
SHANNON KELLOGG I think that's a really good point that you make in terms of making it fun and they can sense if you truly enjoy being with them and then laughing with them, they know that that's real and that you are really enjoying your time with them and so that can be a really nice way of conveying that. And when you're talking about really difficult situations, I feel like that humor gives that relief that they might need because otherwise it can feel really intense. 

00:06:30
LUCY VAIL Uh-hmm. 

00:06:30
SHANNON KELLOGG And so it's kind of a balance of thinking about you know, giving some relief to session but also being able to kind of get down to some of the main issues that they're working on. Uhm, and so I think that's a nice combination and you do that really well in your work with adolescents, yeah. 

00:06:45
Key Concepts for a Strong Working Alliance Humor 70/30 

00:06:45
LUCY VAIL You have this idea about the 70/30, can you explain a little bit about what that is? 

00:06:50
SHANNON KELLOGG So I like to think about a session with the client as 70% of it of a large book of it is working on you know, open exploration, asking them what they think about things, how they feel about things, building that rapport, being an ally and an advocate. And then the other 30% or so being able to figure out how you can challenge them to think differently, behave differently in their-- in a personal relationships. And so that balance of being able to support them and build rapport and then also being able to work on some of them were serious issues of you know, how can we challenge things or how we can push them to expand can be a really nice combination. A lot of times we notice that therapist want to get straight down the business and the change and what happens when we push adolescents to change too fast? 

00:07:45
LUCY VAIL Yeah. They get the opportunity to rebel and push up against you. 

00:07:50
Key Concepts for a Strong Working Alliance Humor 70/30 Reframing 

00:07:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Oftentimes adolescents will come in and something that we talk about a week before that has been kind of a treatment goal, uhm, they will, ah, gone back to. So say that it's tricking in a party or say that it's you know, not showing it for a test or something and they'll come to you in therapy and feel very nervous and worried and kind of expecting you to be the harsh punitive person who says, I can't believe that this happened. Uhm, and so I think reframing can provide an opportunity for us to use those situations and just to kind of figure out what happened, why it happened and kind of what they can learn from it or if they would have handled it differently in the future because part of the growing and changing process especially for adolescents is, is doing things that they would have done differently you know, and being open to that. 

00:08:30
Skills for Building Rapport Open-ended questions 

00:08:35
LUCY VAIL The first skill that we wanted to talk about in working with adolescents and building rapport is open-ended questions. This kind of refers back to when we're talking about genuine curiosity. 

00:08:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:08:45
LUCY VAIL And maintaining that genuine curiosity and not kind of slipping into a position of arriving. 

00:08:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:08:50
LUCY VAIL So open-ended questions are an excellent way, uhm, to kind of keep along that curious path. 

00:09:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Absolutely. And I-- it's helpful with adolescents to ask those open-ended question that's more difficult to have the yes or no answer so it forces then to tell us more about whatever it is we want to know about in a way it explains where they're coming from and it provides that opportunity to really explore that more. What else have you notices helpful about open-ended questions? 

00:09:20
LUCY VAIL I-- it, it provides more information which we can never have too much of. An adolescent might come in and say, uhm, you know, I had a fight with my mom. And I have an idea about what a fight with my mom looks like. 

00:09:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:09:35
LUCY VAIL And if I don't open-ended questions and really probe and get more information about this, I make an assumptions and I might be missing some really critical information. I may think that a fight with your mom includes like yelling, may be some storming around, slamming of doors but it might involve like hitting, throwing things. Open-ended questions really help you gain more and more information and keep you in that curious position. 

00:10:00
Skill for Building Rapport Open-ended questions Self-disclosure 

00:10:00
SHANNON KELLOGG So the second skill that we wanna talk about is self-disclosure with adolescents and self-disclosure can be use sparingly but it can also be a really important skill in terms of building rapport because sometimes you need to share your personal perspective with an adolescent in order to let them know why you became a therapist, why you enjoy working with adolescents. And so I think self-disclosure when used properly can be really important. 

00:10:25
Skill for Building Rapport Open-ended questions Self-disclosure Reviewing confidentiality 

00:10:25
LUCY VAIL Clearly reviewing confidentiality with all client is important and especially with adolescents not only it too critical to build that connection and that trust with them and letting them know exactly where you stand with confidentiality. I also find it's important, uhm, in terms of parents being really clear with them about what I tell parents, what I don't tell parents. 

00:10:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:10:45
LUCY VAIL Uhm, where a confidentiality lies there. If I'm working in a school setting, what I tell teachers or don't tell teachers - 

00:10:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:10:50
LUCY VAIL - if I'm seeing other friends of theirs in counseling where that confidentiality line is. So they're very clear on that. 

00:11:00
SHANNON KELLOGG And provide a good opportunity for modeling boundaries because we're showing the adolescents that we have some rules that we have to abide by in order to keep them say or at times that you'll have to disclose. Uhm, but it can also show that you are setting a clear expectation, you're letting them know what role is and that you're gonna stick to that and that's gonna-- basically it's really important. So it allows like you said that trust develop and also as modeling boundaries which helps them feel in their relationship because as much as confidentiality can be a touchy subject, it can also let them know that your ultimate goal is to be there for them, to keep them safe. 

00:11:35
Skill for Building Rapport Open-ended questions Self-disclosure Reviewing confidentiality Giving over control 

00:11:35
SHANNON KELLOGG There are times when this can become an issue and how you can use, uhm, the relationship, ah, if these issues come up to really talk about it and address the issue when it's important to do so. 

00:11:45
LUCY VAIL You said a bit about giving the adolescent control of the session. I also often say to them you know, I-- you were the boss of me. I am working for you. 

00:11:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:11:55
LUCY VAIL So I'm here trying to help you whatever you feel is the best use of this time or whatever you know, I'm on your team and kind of allowing them to just kind of stir the session. 

00:12:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Absolutely. I think that it helps to feel like we're on their side and we're their advocate and that, uhm, we care not only about their perception of what's important to them and what they want to work on because oftentimes it can feel like an adolescents they're being sort of told what to do or being told what's important. And so when they get to decide that for themselves, it can be really powerful because it might be that some of those things that other people are concern about, are concerning to them or it may be that, that's not something that they wanna work on and it may emerge later. So I think that's a great approach just asking them what they want. 

00:12:40
LUCY VAIL And it can defuse the possibility of rebelling. 

00:12:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Yes. 

00:12:45
LUCY VAIL When you give them control of the session there's nothing to rebel against. If they don't have anything to butt up against. 

00:12:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:12:50
LUCY VAIL And like you're saying, we do have that unique opportunity to work with them or we don't have to impose a lot of rules on them. Get to stay and that support of relationship with them. 

00:12:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, absolutely. 

00:13:05
Next, Lucy builds rapport with Anthony. Anthony was referred for past aggression in the classroom. There is no immediate crisis. 

00:13:15
LUCY VAIL So Anthony is that-- do people call you Anthony or did they call you like Tony or Ton or... 

00:13:20
ANTHONY Tony. 

00:13:20
LUCY VAIL Tony, okay. Uhm, thanks for coming in. Was this your idea to come in or... 

00:13:30
ANTHONY No. 

00:13:30
LUCY VAIL No, I figured as much. You didn't look like you exactly wanted to be here. Who's idea was it for you to come in? 

00:13:40
ANTHONY Totally my parents. 

00:13:40
LUCY VAIL Yeah, your parents, okay. That happens a lot in here. Uhm, so you go to school here? 

00:13:50
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:13:50
LUCY VAIL What grade are you in? 

00:13:50
ANTHONY Senior. 

00:13:50
LUCY VAIL Are you excited about that? Is that a good thing or... 

00:13:55
ANTHONY I guess. 

00:13:55
LUCY VAIL Yeah. Better than being a freshman. 

00:14:00
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:14:00
LUCY VAIL Right. Kind of. Uhm, what do you when you're not at school? What do you for fun that's what I'm trying to ask you really. 

00:14:05
ANTHONY Listen to music. 

00:14:05
LUCY VAIL Listen to music, cool. What kind of music? Do you mind if I ask you? 

00:14:10
ANTHONY Ah, anything with drums. 

00:14:15
LUCY VAIL Anything with the drums. Are you a drummer? 

00:14:15
ANTHONY No. 

00:14:15
LUCY VAIL Yeah, but you like drums. 

00:14:20
ANTHONY Yes. 

00:14:20
LUCY VAIL Who's a good drummer right now? 

00:14:25
ANTHONY Uhm. 

00:14:25
LUCY VAIL No any good drummers? Or is there other any other bands that you like that have a lot of drum or whatever? 

00:14:35
ANTHONY Uhm, yeah. Ah, (inaudible ), uhm, Alesana. 

00:14:45
LUCY VAIL I don't know those bands, are you surprised? 

00:14:45
ANTHONY Nope. 

00:14:45
LUCY VAIL Nope. Awesome, well, I was thinking I was just gonna ask you some questions to kind of get to know you a little bit, is that okay with you? 

00:14:55
ANTHONY Sure. 

00:14:55
LUCY VAIL All right. You know, and any question I ask you if you don't wanna answer you just say, I don't wanna answer that question. You're fully-- it's you're fully-- you know, it's your right to say yes or no. It's not like I'm a teacher where you have to answer my question or the principal or something like that you know, so you don't have to answer my question if you don't like it. So it's not your idea to be here. Your parents want you to be here. I appreciate you coming you know, even though you don't want to be here. Uhm, what else what I like to ask you, ah, do you have any friends? 

00:15:30
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:15:30
LUCY VAIL You do. Do you like them? 

00:15:35
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:15:35
LUCY VAIL That's not a pretty question. A lot of people don't like their friends very much but you like your friends. Did they go to school here or... 

00:15:45
ANTHONY Yeah, some of them. 

00:15:45
LUCY VAIL Yeah. Uhm, so outside of here you listen to music, uhm, what else, anything else? 

00:15:55
ANTHONY Go to concerts. 

00:15:55
LUCY VAIL Oh, you do. Where do they have concerts around here, in San Diego do you go or... 

00:16:00
ANTHONY (inaudible ). 

00:16:05
LUCY VAIL Oh, cool, I heard about that place. Are you surprised that we know about that? 

00:16:10
ANTHONY Hmm, not so much. 

00:16:10
LUCY VAIL No not such much, is that important (inaudible ). 

00:16:15
ANTHONY Yup. 

00:16:15
LUCY VAIL Yeah, I heard about it. So you're senior that's awesome. So you're gonna graduate? 

00:16:20
ANTHONY Probably. 

00:16:20
LUCY VAIL Yeah, you hope so? Is it looking good or how was it looking? 

00:16:25
ANTHONY It's all right. 

00:16:25
LUCY VAIL It's looking all right. Do you think you're gonna graduate? 

00:16:30
ANTHONY Probably. 

00:16:30
LUCY VAIL Yeah, well, it will be good, huh. What are you gonna do after graduation? 

00:16:35
ANTHONY I don't know. 

00:16:40
LUCY VAIL Not sure yet? Yeah, uhm, can I excuse, change question? 

00:16:45
ANTHONY Sure. 

00:16:45
LUCY VAIL Do you like your parents? 

00:16:50
ANTHONY At times. 

00:16:50
LUCY VAIL At times, well, that's good. That's better than never, right? What kind of times do you like them? Or can you name one time that you like time recently or... 

00:17:00
ANTHONY When they leave me alone. 

00:17:00
LUCY VAIL When they leave you alone. How often is that? 

00:17:05
ANTHONY Hardly ever. 

00:17:05
LUCY VAIL Hardly ever. Oh, well, but they leave you alone once in a while? 

00:17:10
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:17:15
LUCY VAIL That's good, right? It's kinda good. Do you wear your sunglasses all the time? 

00:17:20
ANTHONY Yup. 

00:17:20
LUCY VAIL Really. Do you sleep with them on? 

00:17:20
ANTHONY Probably sometimes. 

00:17:25
LUCY VAIL Really? I can't imagine. Do you really sleep with them on? 

00:17:25
ANTHONY Sometimes. 

00:17:30
LUCY VAIL Okay, okay. How can you like wearing sunglasses? 

00:17:35
ANTHONY Ah, my eyes are like really sensitive to all the light. 

00:17:35
LUCY VAIL Oh, really? So you like night time? 

00:17:40
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:17:40
LUCY VAIL Do you like nighttime better? 

00:17:45
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:17:45
LUCY VAIL If you could go anywhere in the world right now, where would you go? 

00:17:50
ANTHONY Probably somewhere in Seattle. 

00:17:50
LUCY VAIL Really, you like Seattle? Have you ever been there before? 

00:17:55
ANTHONY No. 

00:18:00
LUCY VAIL Oh, how do you know about Seattle? 

00:18:00
ANTHONY I like the rain. 

00:18:05
LUCY VAIL And you know, it's a good place for, huh? 

00:18:05
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:18:05
LUCY VAIL You know what the funny thing is about your glasses as I can't talk to you like your (inaudible ) point. 

00:18:12
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:18:12
LUCY VAIL Okay, I figured as much. So Seattle, awesome. Uhm, what would you up there if you could do anything? 

00:18:25
ANTHONY Probably just hang around the parks and eat some food. 

00:18:25
LUCY VAIL What did you say? 

00:18:30
ANTHONY Probably hang around some parks and like eat some food (inaudible ). 

00:18:33
LUCY VAIL Yeah. Cool. Do you think you might wanna go up there after graduation? 

00:18:35
ANTHONY Possibly. 

00:18:40
LUCY VAIL Yeah, I could see you're doing well up there. Would you get a job do you think? 

00:18:45
ANTHONY May be. 

00:18:45
LUCY VAIL Yeah. You know, that's where Starbucks is from. 

00:18:50
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:18:50
LUCY VAIL May be you could get a job at Starbucks, I heard they play-- pay good benefits and stuff, huh. Uhm, let's see, you do watch movies or anything? 

00:19:00
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:19:00
LUCY VAIL Really. I love movies. Can you tell me what kind of movie you like or one that you saw recently? 

00:19:05
ANTHONY Ah, I like gore movies. 

00:19:10
LUCY VAIL Gore movies, awesome. What's the last good gore movie you saw? 

00:19:15
ANTHONY Saw VI. 

00:19:15
LUCY VAIL Saw VI, I can't watch that, it's too scary and you can sleep after that even watch Saw VI and then actually go to sleep and sleep? 

00:19:25
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:19:25
LUCY VAIL Wow, that's impressive, that's a skill, huh. Have you lived in San Diego your whole life? 

00:19:35
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:19:35
LUCY VAIL Are your parents from San Diego? 

00:19:40
ANTHONY Uhm, nope. 

00:19:40
LUCY VAIL How many questions do you think I asked you so far? 

00:19:45
ANTHONY A lot. 

00:19:45
LUCY VAIL Fifty? 

00:19:45
ANTHONY Around. 

00:19:45
LUCY VAIL Do you have any questions you might wanna ask me? You can ask me any question. No questions. Uhm, why did you come if you didn't want to? 

00:20:00
ANTHONY Because I get a lot of ultimatums. 

00:20:05
LUCY VAIL Oh, you do. Yeah, was this an ultimatum coming here? 

00:20:10
ANTHONY Yup? 

00:20:10
LUCY VAIL Do you mind telling me what it was? 

00:20:15
ANTHONY Come here or they kicked out. 

00:20:15
LUCY VAIL Really, wow, that's intense, kicked out of school or the house or... 

00:20:20
ANTHONY Both. 

00:20:25
LUCY VAIL Really, wow, sorry about that. Uhm, I think you made a good decision to come if that was the ultimatum. Who gave you the ultimatum? 

00:20:35
ANTHONY Ah, the principal told me that if I didn't get better then I'd probably get kicked out. And my parents said that if I got kicked out of school I get kicked out of the house. 

00:20:45
LUCY VAIL Gosh, Jesus, is that stressing you out at all or... 

00:20:50
ANTHONY It's fine. 

00:20:50
LUCY VAIL Yeah, sounds kinda stressful to me but it seems like you're just taking it stride, huh. 

00:21:00
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:21:00
LUCY VAIL That's good. You are really even killed kind of person, huh? Do you know, what I mean by that? You seem really calm, is that true do you think? 

00:21:10
ANTHONY Partly. 

00:21:10
LUCY VAIL Partly. You-- do you mean you look calm but you're not so calm? 

00:21:15
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:21:20
LUCY VAIL Okay, that make sense. Oh, there's a couple of things I wanted to tell you about and I think that you're here, uhm, kind of against your will, huh, cuz of this ultimatum. Is there any chance you would agree meeting with me a couple times and then after a couple of times we'll check in and if it's not working out you still want to come, we don't have to do anymore? 

00:21:40
ANTHONY I pretty much have to come. 

00:21:40
LUCY VAIL You have to come, okay. Well, uhm, in that case I'll see-- I mean, if we could work together to figure out something we can do during those times what's not a complete waste to your time. What do you think about that? 

00:21:55
ANTHONY Sure. 

00:21:55
LUCY VAIL All right. Well, I just want to let you know that I'm your counselor, I'm not your mother or your father's counselor. Everything you tell me is confidential. Okay, if you're, if you're-- do you live-- who do you live with? 

00:22:05
ANTHONY Uhm, my parents are separated. 

00:22:10
LUCY VAIL Okay, uhm, do you live with either one more than the other or.... 

00:22:15
ANTHONY Uhm, one week each. 

00:22:15
LUCY VAIL Okay, one week each. So let's say your mom or your dad called me and said, uhm, I know you're seeing Anthony and can you tell me what he's saying? I don't tell them what you're saying. All right, the only thing I say is, yeah, he's seeing me, it's going well, thanks for asking. Okay. 

00:22:30
ANTHONY Uh-hmm. 

00:22:30
LUCY VAIL And I can imagine you might not trust me right off the bat but I'm just letting you know that's the deal that I don't tell them anything that you talk about drug, sex, (inaudible ) the whole thing. I don't tell them about any of that, all right. The other thing, the other part of that though is that there's a couple of instances when I have to tell someone and that is, have you heard this before? 

00:22:55
ANTHONY Yeah. 

00:22:55
LUCY VAIL Okay, what are they? This is a pop quiz. 

00:23:00
ANTHONY Harm to anyone. 

00:23:00
LUCY VAIL Harm to anyone. Okay. So if I feel like you're gonna harm yourself, if you know someone that's gonna harm you or someone else or if someone's been hurting you, abusing you in some way. Make sense? All right. Those are the only times legally I have to break confidence but otherwise everything you tell is just between you and me. Even if a lot of times students at this school I see their friends and I don't even let them know that, that I see you. If someone, uhm, like if I pass you in the hall or I see you outside, do you want me to say hi to you or no? 

00:23:35
ANTHONY No. 

00:23:40
LUCY VAIL Don't say hi, okay. So just you know, I'm not gonna say hi, I'm super friendly but I'm not gonna say hi, okay, whatever you want. Uhm, because I'm your counselor, I'm on your team, I'm here for you, you're kind of the boss of me which I know that sounds kind of strange but it is a situation where you're kind of the boss of me. Okay. I super appreciate you coming and being on time today. That's awesome, are usually on time for things? 

00:24:05
ANTHONY No. 

00:24:10
LUCY VAIL No, well I really appreciate you being on time. If you can't come like if I send you a pass-- let's say you have a test or you're not gonna be in school one day and you think I'm gonna call you out of class, would you just leave me a note? You could just say like, slip it under my door, I can't come tomorrow, Anthony and I'll get the message. 

00:24:25
ANTHONY Sure. 

00:24:25
LUCY VAIL Sound good, all right, cool.

Microtraining Associates Presents 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents Shannon Kellogg Psy.D. and Lucy Vail, MFT Shannon Kellogg Psy.D 

00:25:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Welcome to 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents. In this video we'll review five key components of working with teens. The first and most important stage of working with an adolescent is building rapport. So this means building a strong trusting relationship with the teen and having a good working alliance. Next, we'll review with an adolescent who's struggling with depression and adolescent who's having difficulties with anger management and adolescent who's having trouble with anxiety. Lastly, we'll demonstrate how I work with the teen in a school setting. Even if you're not working directly in a school setting, we'll demonstrate how to work effectively with parents and teachers. When people ask me why I enjoy working with adolescents and kids, my answer is honestly that I genuinely like them and that's one of the most important aspects of working with this population is really liking who you're working with. So you know, getting along well with teenagers, being able to connect with younger people that's essential and it's not for everybody and that's okay. But for people who enjoy it and who love doing it, teenagers will really respond to that because they can tell us if you like them and that is the first and most important step of any working relationship. My experience has include a wide variety of settings over the past ten years in working with teens and adolescents thus, it include, ah, my post doctoral works supervising, ah, family and youth parent partnership program, working in a school setting, ah, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings, ah, with kids, adolescents and families. I've also taught at the college and graduate school level teaching courses of psychology, helping skills and introduction to psychotherapy and marriage and family counseling. 

00:27:20
Lucy Vail MFT 

00:27:20
LUCY VAIL I have really enjoyed working with adolescents for over 20 years even before becoming an MFT, I worked with adolescents in prevention in programs in Boston, in the public housing projects. We had groups of adolescents that met right within their own public housing project and we are able to use alternative interventions like art therapy, hatha yoga, meditation, music and to build resiliencies and promote a healthier lifestyle. Then as an MFT, I've worked with teens in a school setting, in and outpatient mental health clinic and also in day treatment for, uhm, with teens that had such severe emotional struggles that they weren't able to function in a traditional school setting. I think this is one of the most difficult stages in life, it's the streaky transition going from childhood to adulthood. And I guess I have a certain real compassion for this difficult stage and I really enjoy working with adolescents and helping them make this transition, uhm, successfully whatever that means for them into a healthy successful adulthood. My approach with adolescents is client centered and narrative. I think it's a critical first stage to spend time joining and building rapport with adolescents. And I do this by using unconditional positive regard, uhm, being nonjudgmental, being very present and genuinely curious with the adolescent and discovering-- being genuinely curious about their story and their unique perspective. 

00:29:10
Working with Adolescents and Depression 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN In this section I'm working with Madelene(ph) who presents with depression. I'm working with Madelene(ph) from an interpersonal therapy, IPT perspective as well as a cognitive perspective. In IPT the idea is looking at the way that the clients relationships with other people is impacting their depression and can sometimes make their depression worse. So a lot of times teens who are depressed they have more difficulties with their relationships, they're more irritable, they're fighting well with their family and their friends and they also may seek out other people who confirm their negative perspectives about themselves. So they may be surrounding themselves with people who either not treat them well or don't help their self-esteem, feel any better. Often teens who struggle with depression have difficulties with interpersonal relationship so they might be fighting more with their parents, having difficulties with their friends and they may also seek out people who confirm a negative self view of themselves. The cognitive aspect of working with teens is looking at what their world view is and what their beliefs are about themselves. So this might include, uhm, thinking about you know, what they think about themselves, what they think about other people in the world and what they think about their future. And with depression, one of the theories that I like to present to my client is how to think about the cognitive triad of depression. With the cognitive triad of depression teens will often have a overly negative view of themselves, the future and others. So they filter out the positive aspect of themselves and others in their future and they instead focus on the more negative aspects. So what I do is I work with them to be able to recognize that they're overly focused on the negative aspects and also kind of balance out the negative thoughts for some of them or positive thoughts. So I combine the interpersonal relationships as well as the cognitive aspects of working with teens so that they can have a way of viewing their internal world, how they think about themselves as well as changing the actual relationships and how they interact with other people. And that's the example, I help the client to kind of see that the interaction with her boyfriend in particular is confirming her negative self view. She feels fairly confident about herself in other situations but something about the boyfriend who has broken up with her has really made worse her feelings of rejection, uhm, self loathing and feeling negatively about herself. So what we're able to do is look at how she feels about herself and the context of this relationship, uhm, and also recognize that there are some ways that she's not getting herself enough credit for the positive attribute she has. 

00:31:55
Key Interventions for Working with Teens and Depression Key Interventions Cognitive triad of depression Identify negative self-talk Identify strengths and positive attributes 

00:31:55
SHANNON KELLOGG The three key interventions with Madelene(ph) include identifying the cognitive triad of depression. So what are her unrealistic negative views of herself, others and her future. We then identify the negative self-talk relating to her thoughts about herself. We identify the strengths and positive attributes of the client in order to be able to focus her attention on a tape recorder of positive thoughts about herself. The helping skills I'll be demonstrating are adapted by (inaudible ) model of helping including exploration, insight and action. 

00:32:35
Helping Skills Disclosure of insight 

00:32:35
SHANNON KELLOGG The first skill that I demonstrate is disclosure of insight. What I'm able to use a personal example of a time that I've gone through breakup and that it was the idea of the rejection, negative self thoughts that were more upsetting as oppose to the relationship loss. I'm able to show that that may be something that's happening with the client. She's able to then use my disclosure of insight to gain her own insight about what she's going through. Teens specially respond to this because it shows that you're a human and you have also gone through similar difficulties and they're able to have an example to use to really make sense to the concepts that you're trying to demonstrate. 

00:33:10
Helping Skills Disclosure of insight Challenge 

00:33:10
SHANNON KELLOGG The next skill I demonstrate is a challenge and when you challenge a client you are pointing out discrepancy and the way that they're talking about different things or indiscrepancies about ways that you've seen them behave in the past versus what's happening now. So in this instance I talk about on one hand she feels that she's been rejected by her boyfriend and feels like she's unworthy and unlovable. And on the other hand, I've heard her talk a lot about people who wanna be around her relationships that you know, people have asked to go out with her. And there's a way in which she's not able to see that this one example is not really the case and all example. So that's a challenge, it simply showing discrepancy that you're not (inaudible ) and asking a client what they think about that discrepancy. 

00:33:56
Helping Skills Disclosure of insight Challenge Immediacy 

00:34:00
SHANNON KELLOGG The next helping skill that I demonstrate is immediacy and this is about being present in the moment in the session with the client. So when I ask her about how she's feeling, talking with me about the breakup that's an example of immediacy. I'm asking her here and now and the moment how are you feeling. And the purpose of this is to help the client attend to their current emotional state and their current emotions so that they can reflect on how they're feeling. Uhm, this is important especially for adolescents because they often have difficulty with processing emotions and the here and now being aware of their subjective feelings. So immediacy is really helpful because you learn to help them identify their emotions in the moment in a session. The last skill I demonstrate is behavior activation for change or action. 

00:34:45
Helping Skills Disclosure of insight Challenge Immediacy Behavioral activation of change 

00:34:45
SHANNON KELLOGG So these are asking open-ended questions in order to help the client think about how they might start to make changes. So the questions might include, what might you do different in the next relationship or have you thought about ways that you would want things to be different. And it allows the client to sort of in a area explore changes they might make, uhm, and kind of try it on and see what may work well for them. The benefit of asking this in a really open manner is that the client can really take on the changes as their own. So oppose to me suggesting they make a change, I instead ask them what changes they might be interested in making. Uhm, this is helpful again for adolescents who developmentally are looking to really establish their own identity and it's important that they really own the choices that they're making. 

00:35:40
SHANNON KELLOGG How are you doing? 

00:35:40
MADELENE Uhm, I don't know. I've, I've been a little bit better I guess but it's still how to deal with you know. 

00:35:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:35:50
MADELENE The breakup and everything. 

00:35:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, breakups are so hard. 

00:35:55
MADELENE Yeah, I don't, it just-- I don't know how to deal with it I guess. 

00:36:05
SHANNON KELLOGG What are you been doing to kind of try and deal with it? To try and get through. 

00:36:10
MADELENE Uhm, I've been trying-- my mom has been talking to me a lot about it and I've been trying to like get out of the house and like I've been trying to hang out with friends but I don't know, it just not really working I guess. 

00:36:25
SHANNON KELLOGG I see so some of your friends have been trying to take you out and you've been trying to go out with them. What, what happens when you trying? 

00:36:35
MADELENE Uhm, I don't know like we go out and we do the things that we used to do and it's just like-- it just doesn't feel the same that it used to feel like - 

00:36:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:36:45
MADELENE - I'm not enjoying myself when I'm out with them. I don't laugh. 

00:36:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:36:50
MADELENE I don't, I don't feel good about it and I don't really know why. 

00:36:50
Reflection of feelings 

00:36:55
SHANNON KELLOGG You know, we've been talking about this for the last couple of weeks and I really hear how much you're in and I, I know that it's something that you feel like you're stuck in, right? 

00:37:05
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:37:05
SHANNON KELLOGG And you know, one of the ideas I have about how we might be able to think about this and how to get unstuck a little bit is, uhm, is kind of an idea I have. So I don't know if you're open to this but may be I can draw it out for you like on the whiteboard and try and explain kind of this idea I have about what might be happening for you. 

00:37:25
Psychoeducation: The cognitive triad of depression 

00:37:25
MADELENE Okay. 

00:37:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Would that be okay? 

00:37:30
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:37:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

00:37:30
MADELENE Yeah, you can show me that. 

00:37:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay, okay. So I might get up my whitebir-- my whiteboard here. And so basically there is, uhm, there's this way of thinking about some of the depression that happens, uhm, like after a breakup and you know, what you've been talking about with like the low mood and not wanting to do stuff and this feeling really bad and like not enjoying stuff. 

00:37:50
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:37:55
SHANNON KELLOGG So those are all symptoms of the depression that we've been talking about, right? 

00:37:55
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:37:55
SHANNON KELLOGG So with depression, it doesn't just impact one area of our life, it kind of-- it sort of filters into everything and there's this way of thinking about it as a triangle. And it's called the cognitive triangle of depression. 

00:38:10
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:38:10
SHANNON KELLOGG And basically, it says that when you are feeling depressed, you sort of see everything through this filter and all the good stuff kind of gets ignored and you focus on like the really negative stuff, right? 

00:38:25
MADELENE Oh, yeah. 

00:38:25
Self-disclosure for insight 

00:38:25
SHANNON KELLOGG And so you focus on the negative aspects of yourself, you focus on the negative aspects of other people and the negative aspects of like your future. And so, I mean I'll give example from, from what I'd experience is-- so say that I you know, applied for a job that I really wanted, was really important to me and I didn't get the job after the interview. 

00:38:50
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:38:50
SHANNON KELLOGG So I, I got the interview, I was really excited about it, I thought this was a really good fit for me and then it was a no go. So I started feeling like you know, I felt really down of myself like I blew this interview, they don't like me, I'm not smart enough you know, feeling like I just really, uhm, didn't do what I wanted to do in interview and I started feeling negative about other people like you know, everybody else has it easy, they you know, don't really care, they didn't take the time to get to know me. And I started feeling negative about my future like thinking that that was the one job that would have made me feel really happy, you know. 

00:39:25
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:39:25
SHANNON KELLOGG So I was filtering out all the other good aspects or good things like thinking hey, you know, actually I'm able to, to get a different job but there's been lots of times in the past where I didn't get the job after the interview. 

00:39:35
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:39:35
SHANNON KELLOGG And so it's like you don't even pay attention to the positive stuff, it's all like the negative stuff is there. 

00:39:40
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:39:45
SHANNON KELLOGG So I was wondering, I mean, does that make sense kind of the way I'm explaining at it? 

00:39:50
MADELENE Yeah, that make sense. I mean, I feel like that's what I'm doing right now with everything. I'm looking every-- at everything in a negative way but it's almost like I don't know how's-- I can't help it. So I'm not trying to look at things in a negative way. 

00:40:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Exactly. 

00:40:00
MADELENE It just naturally happens you know. 

00:40:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:40:05
MADELENE So I don't know how to change that or like look at things in a better way than I am. 

00:40:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Right. And I think that, that, uhm, is a very real thing where it feels like that's really just all it's there. And the way that we can try and move forward from that is first kind of identifying even what those negative thoughts are. 

00:40:25
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:40:25
Collaboration in Identifying negative self-talk 

00:40:25
SHANNON KELLOGG So we'll start there and then we'll kinda talk about them and see if we can look at it from a different angle. Okay. 

00:40:30
MADELENE Okay. 

00:40:30
SHANNON KELLOGG So you're not alone in this. I can help you kind of work through that, you know. 

00:40:35
MADELENE Okay. 

00:40:35
SHANNON KELLOGG So may be let's start with some negative thoughts you have about yourself. 

00:40:35
Identifying negative self-talk 

00:40:40
MADELENE Okay. Well, I don't know I guess like I guess I feel like I'm not pretty enough like some of the other girls at school like may be that's why my boyfriend broke up with me because he doesn't think I'm good enough that way and I don't know I, I feel like may be I'm boring. Everybody thinks I'm boring like I wasn't entertaining enough for my boyfriend. He didn't think I was funny. He didn't have a good time around me. I don't know. 

00:41:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Well so-- and so those are all really very painful things to, to feel, right? 

00:41:15
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:41:15
SHANNON KELLOGG And is it okay if I kind of just jot down a few of those main core concepts that we-- feeling down about your looks, feeling worried about being boring and worried about feeling - 

00:41:25
MADELENE Not good enough. 

00:41:25
SHANNON KELLOGG - not good enough. Okay. Because you were saying earlier that there's this way in which it feels like you don't want to focus on just negative stuff but it's really hard to get out of there. It feels like you're stuck, right? 

00:41:40
MADELENE Yeah, it does. 

00:41:40
SHANNON KELLOGG So if it's okay with you, I'm gonna try and help you get unstuck by helping you think about other times when you didn't feel that way or other parts of yourself that you feel better about. So let's start by talking more, I wanna hear more about the parts of yourself that you're feeling kind of negatively about. And I wonder if you can tell me more about the idea of worrying that he thinks that you're boring that's why he broke up with you because I hear you saying that you're worried that he thinks you're boring. On the other hand, I remember you talking like may be a month ago that you're saying that you thought that he was kind of not interested not as if you were interested in. And that you weren't even sure that he was that exciting, right? 

00:42:25
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:42:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Is that-- I mean, you remember that? 

00:42:25
MADELENE Yeah, I guess so. When I think about it, when I'm with my friends and other people in my life I guess I don't feel as boring as I do when I'm around him for some reason. I, I don't know why. I've never really thought about that before but I guess sometimes or when I was with him I just like-- I didn't feel as good about myself. 

00:42:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:42:50
MADELENE I don't know why may be sometimes I mean I really like being with him and he made, he made me happy but I don't know he boo me off sometimes and... 

00:43:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. Well, I think that, that being with somebody who boos you off and kind of doesn't treat you that great, that does, that hurts your self-esteem. That makes you feel kind of bad about yourself. 

00:43:15
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:43:15
Disclosure of insight 

00:43:15
SHANNON KELLOGG And you know, I know in the past when I have felt bad about a breakup sometimes it's less about the guy honestly and it's more about the idea of he doesn't want me anymore, you know. 

00:43:25
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:43:30
SHANNON KELLOGG And it sounds like that's what you're saying is, hey, he kind of blew me off and he wasn't really that interested in me and it almost sounds like since you're focusing on that, I think it's easy to forget that you weren't that thrilled with him sometimes you know, he was kind of not everything you are wanting either. 

00:43:45
MADELENE I don't know, I was kind of honestly they came about like and then things with him. 

00:43:50
SHANNON KELLOGG I kind of thought you were the way you were talking about it. 

00:43:55
MADELENE Because-- just because the way he treated me and everything but it was hard because he made-- he made me feel good cuz it made me feel like I had somebody but at the same time it was making me feel bad too. 

00:44:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:44:10
MADELENE So I guess you're right about that, that part. 

00:44:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Well, I hear what you're saying about sometimes he made you feel good and you like to being around him but other times he made you feel really bad. 

00:44:20
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:44:20
SHANNON KELLOGG And I definitely, I think there's something to that relationship with him in particular that was kind of making you feel worse about yourself because I have heard you talk about other people like other guys who wanna date you and, and your friends who like wanna hang out with you a lot. And it seems like other people are really you know, they, they love to hang out with you and they have a great time with you. And I don't hear the same concerns about yourself when you're with them, right? 

00:44:45
MADELENE Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right about that. I mean, yeah, I guess, I don't know there's been some other guys who wanted to date me and - 

00:44:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:44:55
MADELENE - they're like really, I don't know when we hang out we have a really good time together and like I have fun and then laughing. 

00:45:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:45:05
MADELENE But I guess it's just-- it was just hard for me to get out of the relationship that I was in. I didn't know how to do it. 

00:45:15
SHANNON KELLOGG I see. 

00:45:15
MADELENE I just felt like I was stuck almost you know. 

00:45:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Felt like you were stuck. 

00:45:15
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:45:15
Open-ended questions for exploration 

00:45:20
SHANNON KELLOGG What do you think when you look back to that kind of stuck feeling, was there something that you were hoping would be different or something that would happen that would, that would make you feel better about it? 

00:45:30
MADELENE I just thought like, I just thought that he would change the way that he treats me cuz honestly if he change the way he treated me like we could have had an awesome relationship and I thought that he was gonna get better and he was gonna start you know, respecting me more but - 

00:45:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:45:45
MADELENE - I guess it just never happen so... 

00:45:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, and then it felt really disappointing that it didn't happen the way you wanted it to. 

00:45:55
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:45:55
Disclosure of insight 

00:45:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. You know, I have, I have an idea about what might have been happening in that instance with him if you want to hear it. 

00:46:00
MADELENE Okay. 

00:46:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Tell me if you think this might be happening is that sometimes when people make us feel (inaudible ) they say more negative things. We have this desire to kind of please them and we feel like, oh, if he really likes me and if he thinks that I'm great then I feel really good about myself, right? 

00:46:20
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:46:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Uhm, and so it's almost like we work harder to try and get their approval. 

00:46:20
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:46:25
SHANNON KELLOGG And the problem with that is that then the person gets to decide how we feel about ourselves, right? So he gets to decide if we feel good or not. 

00:46:30
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:46:30
SHANNON KELLOGG And the problem with that is that you know, I-- we wanna be able to feel good about ourselves regardless of what, somebody else thinks about us, right? 

00:46:40
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:46:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Because whether he likes you or doesn't like you there's gonna be lots of people who have different feelings about that but when you know that hey, I know what I think about myself and I know they have a lot to offer and funny I have a lot of personality. If he doesn't think so, that's great you know. 

00:46:55
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:46:55
SHANNON KELLOGG May be he's the boring one, right? 

00:46:55
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:46:55
SHANNON KELLOGG So it's kind of like thinking about it as it's nice when people like you and it feels really good but he's not the one who gets to decide you know. 

00:47:05
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:47:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:47:05
MADELENE I guess you're right about that I mean... 

00:47:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Does that seem like you... 

00:47:10
MADELENE I guess and like the grand scheme of everything. He's just one guy and there's a lot more people out there and a lot of other people out there. It's just we were together for so long, it's just hard to focus on that sometimes you know. 

00:47:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Exactly. 

00:47:20
MADELENE But I can, I can see what you're saying. 

00:47:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:47:25
MADELENE How I shouldn't just focus on that one guy and what happen between us, the time we were together you know. 

00:47:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Right and I know how easy it is cuz like you said, you guys were together for a really long time and you were, you cared about him, I know you did. Uhm, but looking back sometimes when you focus on just the things that you wish were different or the things that you weren't happy with in the relationship - 

00:47:45
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:47:45
SHANNON KELLOGG - that's the part where it's hard to see the bigger pictures. 

00:47:50
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:47:50
SHANNON KELLOGG So that's why it kind of challenge you a little bit because I remember that there was other stuff there. 

00:47:55
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:47:55
Challenge 

00:47:55
SHANNON KELLOGG And I think that we only sometimes you're remembering only the stuff that you know, oh, he was great or he made me feel good sometimes. 

00:48:00
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:48:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Right. 

00:48:00
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:48:00
SHANNON KELLOGG So I hope that's okay that I kind of try and remind you these things cuz I wanna be able to help you know that there's other stuff there. 

00:48:10
MADELENE Okay. 

00:48:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

00:48:10
MADELENE So are you saying, I should start doing like trying to do other things where I like not think about that, is that what you were saying? 

00:48:15
SHANNON KELLOGG I don't know. I mean, what do you think? 

00:48:20
MADELENE Uhm, I don't know, that could be a good idea cuz I mean even though I have been going out and trying to make myself feel better about this I still think about it - 

00:48:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:48:30
MADELENE - while I'm out there. 

00:48:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:48:30
MADELENE So if I can get myself to go out and do things where I'm not thinking about it - 

00:48:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:48:35
MADELENE - then I think that would make me feel better. 

00:48:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay, I think that would be great if you're willing to try that and kind of even noticing when you start kind of going down that path of thinking about him. If you can kinda take him and say, oh, it's happening, I'm thinking about him and I'm kinda starting to get down on myself again. 

00:48:50
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:48:50
SHANNON KELLOGG And remind yourself, hey, he's one person, yes, he meant a lot to me but I'm here with my friends now and I'm gonna focus on stuff that I like about myself and the people I'm with now. 

00:49:00
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:49:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:49:05
MADELENE That's a good idea. 

00:49:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

00:49:05
MADELENE I mean it's gonna be-- I think it's gonna be kind of hard at first - 

00:49:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:49:10
MADELENE - to not focus on him. 

00:49:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:49:10
MADELENE But I think that the more I do it, the less I start thinking about him, it's gonna get easier for me. I hope so. 

00:49:20
SHANNON KELLOGG And so at least. I think so. 

00:49:20
MADELENE But, uhm... 

00:49:20
SHANNON KELLOGG It will, it will get better. 

00:49:25
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:49:25
SHANNON KELLOGG The hard part about breakups is that when you're on the thick of it, it feel so bad and it feels really painful - 

00:49:30
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:49:30
SHANNON KELLOGG - and it always gets better. 

00:49:30
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:49:30
Immediacy 

00:49:30
SHANNON KELLOGG So how does it feel that we're talking about the breakup? 

00:49:35
MADELENE Uhm, well, it was really hard, it was hard at first to talk about it. 

00:49:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:49:40
MADELENE It was something that I really didn't wanna talk about but I don't know, it, it feels good to get some of these things off of my chest and to talk with somebody about it. 

00:49:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:49:55
MADELENE And have them listen to me and like - 

00:49:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:49:55
MADELENE - it seems like you understand what I'm saying because you've had similar experiences - 

00:50:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:50:00
MADELENE - so that makes me feel better about it. 

00:50:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:50:05
MADELENE But I don't know, it feels, it feels good to talk about it, I think. It's a good start - 

00:50:10
SHANNON KELLOGG I know when-- it's a good start. 

00:50:10
MADELENE - to get, to get pass this so... 

00:50:15
SHANNON KELLOGG I'm glad to hear that. I know that when you came in you're feeling really kind of down and stuck about things and I wonder if it feels, if it feels different in some way. 

00:50:25
MADELENE Yeah, because before I didn't wanna talk to anybody about it, I just internalized everything but I find that talking to somebody about it kind of like it feels like it lets that out of me so I can - 

00:50:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:50:35
MADELENE - get it out and I can almost move past it, easier now if I get-- if I let it out. 

00:50:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

00:50:45
MADELENE So I'm happy that I'm talking about it. 

00:50:45
Open-ended questions for behavioral activation of change 

00:50:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. So I wonder if that-- do you think that that's the case with you a lot times like when you talk about stuff that it's kinda weighing on you. Does it feel better usually? 

00:50:55
MADELENE Yeah, it does feel better when I talk about things cuz for me one of the things I do a lot is automatically just keep it inside and not talk to people about it. 

00:51:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:51:05
MADELENE But I'm starting to learn that. I can't do that because the more I keep things inside, the more I just eats a way of me and it almost feels like it becomes worse and it really is. 

00:51:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:51:20
MADELENE So like talking to you right now it's almost like lifted all-- like a way off my shoulders. 

00:51:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:51:25
MADELENE So I'm starting to feel like I can focus on other things in my life. 

00:51:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

00:51:30
MADELENE So it's nice. 

00:51:35
SHANNON KELLOGG I'm so glad to hear that. I think that, that - 

00:51:35
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:51:35
SHANNON KELLOGG - is one of the benefits of having a place where we can say, look, this is our time for you to think about everything that's been going on kind of inside in your head and we have a chance to really just take a look at it. And sometimes when you take a look at it, it, it doesn't feel as bad anymore, you know - 

00:51:50
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:51:50
SHANNON KELLOGG - it feels like it's manageable and you can handle it. 

00:51:50
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:51:50
Focusing on strengths and resiliency 

00:51:50
SHANNON KELLOGG And I have seen you-- there-- you have so many great qualities and you have so many characteristics that are really strengths and I feel like reminding yourself about those things when you're feeling really down because those are still there. Those are still inside of you. 

00:52:10
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:52:10
SHANNON KELLOGG It's just hard to see them. 

00:52:10
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:52:10
SHANNON KELLOGG When it was kind of negative thoughts are there, you know. 

00:52:10
MADELENE Yeah, definitely. 

00:52:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, have you thought about you know, you had mentioned a couple other guys have asked you out and I know that many guys have, have-- not interested in you in the past and you always had your boyfriend, right? 

00:52:25
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:52:25
SHANNON KELLOGG And you didn't even, uhm, think about you know, other guys. 

00:52:30
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:52:30
Open-ended questions for behavioral activation of change 

00:52:30
SHANNON KELLOGG And I wonder you know, talking about what you went through. Is there, is there anything that you think about that you'd want different in your next relationship? 

00:52:40
MADELENE Well, now that I'm starting to look back in my relationship and see it from the different perspective instead of being inside of it. I think I need-- if I want to get another boyfriend, I need to be with someone who doesn't, who doesn't talk to me the way that Chris talk to me sometimes. And who doesn't blow me off. I think I need someone who really like respects me - 

00:53:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:53:10
MADELENE - and listens to me and cares about me a lot. 

00:53:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:53:10
MADELENE I think that's important. So if I do get another relationship I think - 

00:53:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:53:20
MADELENE - that something I need in my life. 

00:53:20
SHANNON KELLOGG I agree and you deserve all of those things. You deserve somebody who respects you and who treats you well and who doesn't blow you off because I mean guy should want to be hanging out around with you. You're a lovely young woman and - 

00:53:30
MADELENE Thank you. 

00:53:35
SHANNON KELLOGG - any guy who doesn't, he's crazy you know, he's-- and so I think that sometimes if we know what I call, uhm, with our red flags so that when you're kind of thinking of a potential guy that you might wanna date. If we think about what red flags might be about, hey, this guy must be trouble, right? 

00:53:50
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:53:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Are there any red flags you could think of that to notice that might be a bad sign for future guys you might date. 

00:54:00
MADELENE Uhm, well, I usually go for like bad boys so that's probably why - 

00:54:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:54:05
MADELENE - that happens. 

00:54:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Wait. So what's a bad boy though like what-- like tell me what's that? 

00:54:10
MADELENE Uhm, I don't know they're like guys who they're kind of like rebellious something like do what they're not supposed to do and like talk back to people. I don't know but I don't know why I like bad boys. 

00:54:25
SHANNON KELLOGG What do you think of the-- what is it about something must be appealing, right? 

00:54:30
MADELENE Yeah, I think it just like there's like a dangerous side to it but I don't know, I mean bad boys are fun in everything but may be they're not good boyfriends I guess. I don't know. 

00:54:40
Open question for action/change 

00:54:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. Well, why do you think that makes a good boyfriend? 

00:54:45
MADELENE Uhm, well, I think a good boyfriend is somebody who would-- will be able to listen to me. 

00:54:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:54:50
MADELENE Will be able to support me in what I want to do. 

00:54:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:54:55
MADELENE Somebody that we can go have a good time together. 

00:55:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:55:00
MADELENE I just think somebody, somebody who overall really respects me and wants the best for me. 

00:55:05
SHANNON KELLOGG That sounds great. 

00:55:10
MADELENE Yeah, I just have to find someone like that. 

00:55:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Have you met any guys like that in past even just friends or people that you know, I mean, do they exist those people like that? 

00:55:15
MADELENE Yeah, I, I have a lot of guy friends who, who really respect me and who, who really treat me well. 

00:55:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

00:55:25
MADELENE I guess I just never pursue them in that way but... 

00:55:30
SHANNON KELLOGG I see. So is it may be like broadening your scope of like who you would-- who you might consider dating in terms of like, hey, before I was really attracted to the bad guy and like that dangerous but now, I'm kind of sometimes we can sort of shift what we're attracted to because we think you know, I really value somebody who's respectful and like who listens to me and so you can almost shift and like broaden your scope. But before I would have only considered dating this ca-- type of guy you know. 

00:55:55
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:55:55
SHANNON KELLOGG And may be now I can think of other types that I might, I might actually really like. 

00:56:00
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:56:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:56:00
MADELENE I've never really thought about that before and considered it but if I did wanna get into another relationship may be I could you know, consider some of my friends-- some of my guy friends who actually treat me in that way instead of - 

00:56:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:56:15
MADELENE - automatically go in for the one I hope will treat me well. 

00:56:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Ah, the one we're trying to change, right? 

00:56:20
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:56:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Cuz that's so hard to try and change somebody as oppose to you know, finding somebody who already thinks you're spectacular you know. 

00:56:30
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:56:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:56:30
MADELENE Definitely. 

00:56:30
SHANNON KELLOGG So I mean that's so cool that you're willing to kinda be open to that and whether it's a friend that you've know in the past or even guys that you meet in the future you know, just kind of being able to view that hey, - 

00:56:40
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:56:40
SHANNON KELLOGG - these are the characteristics, these are what I'm really looking for. 

00:56:40
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:56:40
SHANNON KELLOGG And this is what I you know, I'm interested in. 

00:56:45
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:56:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uhm. 

00:56:45
MADELENE It's a different way of thinking for me but... 

00:56:50
SHANNON KELLOGG It is. 

00:56:50
MADELENE I mean, I think change is a good thing. 

00:56:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

00:56:50
MADELENE Because if I don't-- I guess if I don't change anything then it's-- I'll end up where I'd-- where I am right now if I don't look at things differently so... 

00:57:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, and that's all you can ask of yourself is just to be willing to look at things differently and to say - 

00:57:05
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:57:05
SHANNON KELLOGG - look, you know, I've been through really hard times in the past and didn't work and I ended up feeling really bad. 

00:57:10
MADELENE Uh-hmm. 

00:57:10
SHANNON KELLOGG And you know, how can I help myself to not, not go through that you know. 

00:57:15
MADELENE Yeah. 

00:57:20
SHANNON KELLOGG So I, I really respect that you're willing to, to think about that and to think of how you can have a better time in the future you know. 

00:57:25
MADELENE Yeah, definitely.

Microtraining Associates Presents 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents Shannon Kellogg Psy.D. and Lucy Vail, MFT Shannon Kellogg Psy.D 

00:58:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Welcome to 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents. In this video we'll review five key components of working with teens. The first and most important stage of working with an adolescent is building rapport. So this means building a strong trusting relationship with the teen and having a good working alliance. Next, we'll review with an adolescent who's struggling with depression and adolescent who's having difficulties with anger management and adolescent who's having trouble with anxiety. Lastly, we'll demonstrate how I work with the teen in a school setting. Even if you're not working directly in a school setting, we'll demonstrate how to work effectively with parents and teachers. When people ask me why I enjoy working with adolescents and kids, my answer is honestly that I genuinely like them and that's one of the most important aspects of working with this population is really liking who you're working with. So you know, getting along well with teenagers, being able to connect with younger people that's essential and it's not for everybody and that's okay. But for people who enjoy it and who love doing it, teenagers will really respond to that because they can tell us if you like them and that is the first and most important step of any working relationship. My experience has include a wide variety of settings over the past ten years in working with teens and adolescents thus, it included, ah, my post doctoral works supervising, ah, family and youth parent partnership program, working in a school setting, ah, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings, ah, with kids, adolescents and families. I've also thought at the college and graduate school level teaching courses of psychology, helping skills and introduction to psychotherapy and marriage and family counseling. 

01:00:15
Lucy Vail MFT 

01:00:15
LUCY VAIL I have really enjoyed working with adolescents for over 20 years even before becoming an MFT, I worked with adolescents in prevention in programs in Boston, in the public housing projects. We had groups of adolescents that met right within their own public housing project and we are able to use alternative interventions like art therapy, hatha yoga, meditation, music and to build resiliencies and promote a healthier lifestyle. Then as an MFT, I've worked with teens in a school setting, in and outpatient mental health clinic and also in day treatment for, uhm, with teens that had such severe emotional struggles that they weren't able to function in a traditional school setting. I think this is one of the most difficult stages in life, it's the streaky transition going from childhood to adulthood. And I guess I have a certain real compassion for this difficult stage and I really enjoy working with adolescents and helping them make this transition successfully whatever that means for them into a healthy successful adulthood. My approach with adolescents is client centered and narrative. I think it's a critical first stage to spend time joining and building rapport with adolescents. And I do this by using unconditional positive regard, uhm, being nonjudgmental, being very present and genuinely curious with the adolescent and discovering-- being genuinely curious about their story and their unique perspective. 

01:02:05
Anger Management and Adolescents 

01:02:10
LUCY VAIL Although we might traditionally think of males when thinking of anger and aggression increasingly both males and females adolescents are referred to counseling, struggling with anger and aggression. Anger can be a socially acceptable and safer way to express more vulnerable emotions such as fear, anxiety, disappointment, depression. It can act like a mask and once you scratch the surface more challenging feelings are revealed. By the time an adolescent is referred for counseling, it's likely they've been struggling with the negative effects of anger and aggression for quite sometime. I'm not surprised to find them having very low self-esteem, struggling with, ah, shame and self-blame. There's a very common misconception that this anger and these aggressive behaviors are an inherent unchangeable part of oneself. When actually these behaviors may have been learned and they may have been serving a very useful purpose. They also might be highly and somewhat easily changeable. 

01:03:30
Narrative Cognitive Behavioral Exploring Personal Stories Externalize Preferred Identities Thoughts Behavior Actions Consequences 

01:03:30
LUCY VAIL Here, we use a combination of narrative and cognitive behavioral therapies to help adolescents struggling with aggressive behaviors. First, we use narrative approaches of exploring one's own relationship and story of anger and aggression. Then we externalize the anger and together we work to create preferred stories and identities and preferred behaviors. Using cognitive behavioral techniques, we look at the relationship between thoughts, behaviors, actions and consequences and through this we can really slow the process down and start to look at these, ah, moments just seconds where one can choose another behavior, a behavior that will work better for them and be more beneficial. Encouraging self-efficacy and personal power to change one's behavior can be very liberating to an adolescent who previously thought that they have no choice or no chance of changing these problematic behaviors. The aim is to inspire and empower adolescents, to change their behavior and change it to suit their own needs. Every time an adolescent is referred to counseling for anger and aggression there is likely a story behind this. And there's likely a very reasonable explanation for their behavior by looking at the history, origins, and personal story the adolescent can gain some distance from the story and develop a broader perspective. It can be very freeing to entertain the idea that these dispu-- anger and these aggressive behaviors are not an inherent part of oneself. Next I meet with Anthony who's been struggling with the negative effects of his aggressive behavior for quite sometime. And together we're going to look at his story, externalize the anger and develop a alternative or some alternative behaviors for him to choose from.

LUCY VAIL As mentioned earlier in the building rapport section, joining with the adolescent client is paramount. Forming an alliance and trust must be the first on the list. A warm, unconditionally accepting, non-judgmental, non-blaming, collaborative stance will lay the foundation for future exploration and experimentation. Educating and empowering the client to make alternative choices to aggressive behavior promote self-efficacy and helps your client eliminate unfavorable consequences. The intervention that I'm using here with Anthony is gaining perspective and beginning to externalize the anger. We do this through questions and curiosity. We look at the history of the anger. When did all start? Does anyone else in your family struggling with aggression and anger? Do you think you could have learn this? We try to name the anger. If you have to give this a name, what would you call it? We map the effects, the anger has had on the clients life. What kind of effect has this had on you? What would it be like if you didn't struggle with anger? We look at the ABC's or action, behavior and consequences. This comes from ART or aggression replacement training. There's three parts to the anger, the action, what happened to trigger the anger? The behavior, how did you react? What did you do in reaction to the trigger and the consequences? What was the end result? 

01:07:35
Mindfulness Witnessing the anger Noticing each moment Body cues Triggers External Internal Positive self-talk Acknowledging slight accomplishment Self-congratulations Building confidence and self-esteem 

01:07:40
LUCY VAIL Next we'll look at mindfulness. This includes witnessing the anger, noticing each moment and noticing body cues. In that moment when you just begin to get really worked up, do you notice anything in your body? Some people say they have sweaty palms, heart racing or a headache. I wonder if you could notice that for me. Then we look at triggers both external and internal. You know your triggers, it's not a mystery. External triggers are outside influences, outside forces. Internally triggers are thoughts, memories. I might ask, do you know what your triggers are, external triggers and internal triggers? Next is positive self-talk, acknowledging slight accomplishments, giving self-congratulations, building confidence and self-esteem. Is there one thing that you could save yourself to help yourself get through it? May be it's not worth it or I got this or I'm okay or these suckers are gonna get me this time. 

01:08:55
The Session 

01:09:00
LUCY VAIL So well, Anthony, thank so much for coming. Uhm, I appreciate it, I know that this probably is not your very favorite place to be. There isn't somewhere else you'd rather be, is there? 

01:09:10
ANTHONY Uhm. 

01:09:10
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:09:10
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:09:15
LUCY VAIL Probably million places, right? Who's idea was it for you to come, do you know? 

01:09:15
ANTHONY I don't know. I know my mom definitely thought I was crazy or something. 

01:09:20
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

01:09:20
ANTHONY My teacher, Mr. Martin didn't really enjoy (inaudible ) face but... 

01:09:25
LUCY VAIL Okay, right. 

01:09:25
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:09:25
LUCY VAIL Well, that make sense, yeah, so I heard about that, you're having a little trouble with Mr. Martin, huh, in Mr. Martin's class. 

01:09:35
ANTHONY Yeah, he made me really mad. 

01:09:35
LUCY VAIL Yeah, what happens when you get really mad? What does that look like? It's different from everybody, right? 

01:09:40
ANTHONY I just-- it's something I can't really explain it, it just kind of something comes over me and I can't control my anger and people just really agitate me. 

01:09:50
LUCY VAIL Okay. Do you-- so in this-- the recent time right Mr., uhm, Martin pissed you off or something, right and you threw a stapler at him. Has there been other instances like that where, uhm, you throw things or do you yell or, uhm... 

01:10:05
ANTHONY I mean, yeah, I mean, who doesn't get angry? Okay. I don't have a problem. 

01:10:10
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:10:10
ANTHONY Who doesn't get angry every once in a while, yell at someone or throw something down, I mean, I guess it kinda started when I was in my fourth grade or something cuz I had-- started really get in trouble for it but - 

01:10:15
LUCY VAIL Right. 

01:10:15
ANTHONY - but I don't think it does anything wrong with it. 

01:10:20
LUCY VAIL Right, right. Well, it's prying for a perfectly good reason, huh? I mean people don't get angry for no good reason you know, they don't just start flying off the handle for no good reason so I can understand that. Uhm, do you mind if I ask you question? 

01:10:35
ANTHONY (inaudible ). 

01:10:37
LUCY VAIL Has there been anybody else in your family that struggles with the same kind of thing with anger or-- is that a crazy question? 

01:10:45
ANTHONY I mean, I guess my dad gets angry all the time so everyone know well - 

01:10:50
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:10:50
ANTHONY - who get angry and yell but I mean, everyone gets angry. 

01:10:55
LUCY VAIL Yeah, it's true everybody does get angry. Uhm, when your dad gets really angry what does that look like? 

01:11:05
ANTHONY He yell, sometimes he'll throw something, rip up a paper if he's not at it, I mean... 

01:11:10
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:11:10
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:11:10
LUCY VAIL Stuff like that. Uhm, do you know if it ever got him into trouble in any way or? 

01:11:15
ANTHONY I don't know, I guess it could have - 

01:11:15
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:11:15
ANTHONY - when he was younger. 

01:11:20
LUCY VAIL Yeah, yeah. Hmm, anyhow, uhm, well, I really appreciate you meeting with me. I know you don't wanna be here, uhm, I was thinking though if you're open to meeting with me for a couple of times we could just see if-- you know, the thing I wanted to tell you is I'm here for you. I'm on your team, I totally-- Anthony, and I was thinking if you have to meet with me a couple times, why not see if there's any chance we can make some headway with thing, huh? 

01:11:50
ANTHONY Sure. I guess so. 

01:11:50
LUCY VAIL All right. I mean it's been getting you into a little bit of trouble, right? 

01:11:55
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:11:55
LUCY VAIL Do you think-- are okay with the way things have been going? It's not your question or would you like things to go a little bit differently or how are you with it at the, at the moment? 

01:12:05
ANTHONY I mean, I don't wanna get angry. I don't choose to get angry. I mean, I don't wanna be in trouble obviously, I don't wanna be here so... 

01:12:15
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

01:12:15
ANTHONY I-- yeah, if you could fix it, I'd be great I guess. 

01:12:15
LUCY VAIL Okay, so if there's something we could do here to even just make it a little bit better that would be worth your while to come a couple times, huh? 

01:12:20
ANTHONY If you think that would help then yeah, sure. 

01:12:25
LUCY VAIL Okay. Well, I am certainly willing to give it a shot. I've got no guarantees but my idea which I usually tell people is, let's meet a couple times, talk about it then we'll check in and if you find that it's not worth your time or you don't wanna come back then you don't have to come back. 

01:12:40
ANTHONY Okay. 

01:12:40
LUCY VAIL Okay, nobody has to see me that doesn't want to see me. All right. I don't wanna be-- anybody to be here that doesn't wanna be here so all right, well, that's a deal. All right, so I was thinking you told me your dad kinda struggles with anger or sometimes too. Uhm, what do you think about that? What do you make of that, that both you and your dad struggle with this? 

01:13:00
ANTHONY I mean, I guess it could be related to us but - 

01:13:05
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:13:05
ANTHONY - may be it's something in our family, that runs in our family. (inaudible ) maybe? 

01:13:10
LUCY VAIL Do you think so? Yeah. Do you think that could be a possibility? 

01:13:15
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:13:15
LUCY VAIL I often think about that because this is what I think Anthony, people are born mad, right? You're not like two hours old and you're mad a sec, right? So there's gotta be something going and usually people either learn it from someone or there's something really making them angry. So I guess that's a possibility, who knows right? You could have gotten it from your dad. It could be, ah, a thing that you learn from him that's-- I see that a lot, yeah. So what seems like the way I think about like this anger, his kind of have been bossing you around, huh. What are some of the things that anger has been getting you to do besides throwing the stapler at Mr. Martin. Are there other things that anger get you to do or... 

01:14:00
ANTHONY The other day I had a pretty big fight with-- argument my-- with my sister. 

01:14:05
LUCY VAIL Uh-hmm. 

01:14:05
ANTHONY And we, uhm, we kind of gotten into a big fight and then I got my parents angered and I thought like the more everyone else yelled at me the more angry I got and the more I just wanted to everything to stop and I wanted to just get out of there as fast as possible. 

01:14:20
LUCY VAIL Okay. Yeah, it, it sounds like not a good situation, huh? 

01:14:25
ANTHONY It's not fun though. 

01:14:25
LUCY VAIL What happens when you and your sister fight, is there you know, yelling, hitting, throwing, it's different for everybody so I just wondered what that looks like. 

01:14:30
ANTHONY Lots of yelling, lots of door slamming. It hasn't gotten physical so that's-- I guess a good sign. 

01:14:35
LUCY VAIL Oh, that's good, yeah, yeah. So anger has been kind of getting you to-- getting you into some trouble at home too. 

01:14:45
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:14:45
LUCY VAIL It sounds like it's been getting you into trouble at school with Mr. Martin and it's been getting into trouble at, at home too, huh? Yeah. Uhm, if you had like name this thing, what would you name it? 

01:15:00
ANTHONY I don't know just like temper tantrum and that's... 

01:15:00
LUCY VAIL Temper tantrum, okay. All right, so temper tantrum has been kind of getting the best of you? 

01:15:05
ANTHONY I guess you could say that, yeah. 

01:15:10
LUCY VAIL Do you know what I mean by that? Could you, could you imagine like if temper tantrum is like bossing you around? I just this-- I have this idea that like you know, this temper tantrum has been bossing you around and getting you to get into trouble in school, in the classroom, at home and stuff like that. 

01:15:25
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:15:25
LUCY VAIL What do think about that idea? Have any thoughts on that? 

01:15:30
ANTHONY It make sense I guess like how it kinda controls my life in a way I can't, I can't stop it, I have no control over it. 

01:15:35
LUCY VAIL Wow. Those are some powerful things, controls your life, you've no control over it. Well, I have some ideas and I was wondering if you might be open too? 

01:15:45
ANTHONY Sure. 

01:15:50
LUCY VAIL Okay. One thing is this, so we were talking about this anger pitching a fit, did you say pitching a fit? 

01:16:00
ANTHONY I think it's a temper tantrum. 

01:16:00
LUCY VAIL Temper tantrum, sorry, temper tantrum. I might gonna keep it straight. This temper tantrum has been kind of bossing you around, getting you to some trouble, uhm, what kind of effect does it had on your life? 

01:16:10
ANTHONY Well, it gets me to all of trouble. It makes me have to be grounded or be here. 

01:16:15
LUCY VAIL Oh, wow, yeah. 

01:16:15
ANTHONY And (inaudible ). 

01:16:18
LUCY VAIL Don't worry, I don't take offense. A lot of people don't really see me. So it's been, it's been-- some of the effects is that it's, it's been getting you into trouble, getting you grounded, really? 

01:16:25
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:16:30
LUCY VAIL Whats-- can you tell me more about that? 

01:16:30
ANTHONY Well, I get in a fight with my sister and my parents or like this and my parents think that keeping at home and locking me up in my room is gonna help but really to make me even more mad. And it doesn't help at all. It just makes me mad and why I yell at them more so. 

01:16:45
LUCY VAIL Right. So long-- how often is that happening? How often do you find yourself grounded? 

01:16:50
ANTHONY In the past month it happens almost every week now. 

01:16:55
LUCY VAIL Really. 

01:16:55
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:16:55
LUCY VAIL Well, that's a lot. That's a whole lot. What do you think it would be like at home if, uhm, well, you said temper tantrums were, uhm, did you say controlling your life? 

01:17:10
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:17:10
LUCY VAIL Were there-- was the words that you use? What do you think your life would be like if, if temper tantrums weren't controlling your life like if you-- can you even imagine that like just for a moment? 

01:17:20
ANTHONY I mean, I guess it be nice - 

01:17:20
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:17:20
ANTHONY - but I honestly I don't see that happening any time soon. 

01:17:25
LUCY VAIL Right. 

01:17:25
ANTHONY It's-- and it's not me if I guess that people around me would stop irritating me then yeah, it could, it could happen but... 

01:17:30
LUCY VAIL Right, so it's hard to imagine right now? 

01:17:35
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:17:35
LUCY VAIL Yeah. Well, I have some ideas and, uhm, I was hoping you might be open to hearing them. 

01:17:40
ANTHONY I guess I'm here so I got... 

01:17:45
LUCY VAIL Okay. Will you tell me if you do not like my idea? 

01:17:45
ANTHONY Okay. 

01:17:45
LUCY VAIL Because this is actually a place where you can tell me, no, that's not true, I don't like that idea. It's not like I'm a teacher and you know, respect me and follow all my ideas but if I have an idea that you think is a bad idea or doesn't fit with you I hope you're gonna tell me. 

01:18:00
ANTHONY Okay. 

01:18:00
LUCY VAIL Okay, deal. Uhm, one thing is this, I like to look at anger in like three parts, right? And then one easy way to think about it is like ABC. I know it sounds kinda stupid to begin with but I believe you hear me out? 

01:18:15
ANTHONY Sure. 

01:18:15
LUCY VAIL Stick with me, okay. So ABC I think of it like action, behavior, consequences, right? So AB action is like the trigger and that's like what gets you angry, right? We can talk about that more in a minute but you probably know what gets you angry, right? Isn't that like a big mystery? You had a list of things that really gets you angry? Yeah. The behavior is like what you do in response to that, right? What you do in response to the trigger? Sometimes throwing a stapler at Mr. Martin or you know, yelling at your sister slamming doors whatever it is, right? And then C is the consequences, what happens. Ah, being grounded, Mr. Martin send you to the principal's office. I'm not trying to like go through the painful recent history but I'm just saying, that's the kind of consequences of re-- your reaction to the triggers, right? Because sometimes if we can really break it down and look at it, there is a possibility that I can help you come up with, ah, another kind of reaction to anger. And I would like to see you getting like a little bit more control of the anger. What do you think about that? 

01:19:25
ANTHONY That sounds a bit good idea, yeah. 

01:19:25
LUCY VAIL Okay. I know you said that you couldn't imagine at the moment that it was kinda like something that you thought had control over you wasn't a possibility but I have to tell you I have a little hope but I have some ideas and I'd love to give it a shot if you give me a shot, uhm, to hear some of these things and then we can see if it can help at all, all right? 

01:19:45
ANTHONY Okay. 

01:19:45
LUCY VAIL Okay. So actually I wanted to time out and kind of rewind for a second, do you mind? 

01:19:50
ANTHONY Okay. 

01:19:55
LUCY VAIL Uhm, you said something that really struck me a little while back. And you said that it hasn't gotten physical yet. 

01:20:00
ANTHONY Uh-hmm. 

01:20:05
LUCY VAIL Well, I wonder what you think about that cuz you would also told me that anger has control over your life, right? What do you think about someone that's been able to stop it from getting physical? 

01:20:20
ANTHONY Well, I mean, I guess (inaudible ) that means I would have some sort of control over it and so may be there's still hope. 

01:20:30
LUCY VAIL Right. Have you ever thought about that before? 

01:20:30
ANTHONY Not really and that's-- it's kind of comforting to know that-- to realize that there are some sort control at some level on my part. 

01:20:40
LUCY VAIL Right. I really get such a strong sense from you Anthony that you really wanna make things better and I really just-- I really appreciate that. Is there anything else that you think of that you tell yourself that, uhm, keeps you from kinda taking it to the next physical level? 

01:20:55
ANTHONY (inaudible ) to tell myself to calm down sometimes cuz I, - 

01:21:00
LUCY VAIL Yeah. 

01:21:00
ANTHONY - I think I really realizing it what I'm really getting really angry and I just kind of ro-- remove myself from the situation sometimes. 

01:21:10
LUCY VAIL Right. 

01:21:10
ANTHONY And just take a breather and be away from the problem. 

01:21:15
LUCY VAIL Excellent. Good for you. So you've got this thing have half already figured out. You're making my job look really easy. I don't hardly have to do anything. You know, you brought up a good point, many good points, one of which was that, uhm, what did you say if you stop for a minute? What was your-- how did you say it? I have such a bad memory. You said, if I stop for a minute or if I take a break or... 

01:21:35
ANTHONY (inaudible ) just take a breather, get out, remove myself from that situation. 

01:21:40
LUCY VAIL Oh, remove yourself from the situation. That's what I was thinking. I had my idea. Now, it's a crazy idea but, uhm, are you open to hearing it? 

01:21:50
ANTHONY Go ahead. 

01:21:50
LUCY VAIL Okay. For example, something we might be able to try out in Mr. Martin's class, right? What about if when you start to get upset and you're like just about to blow, right? What about if we worked out with Mr. Martin, you have some kind of way to tell him that you don't have to tell the whole class and you could just step outside for like a minute and catch your breath. What do you think about that idea? 

01:22:15
ANTHONY I think that could work. It could prevent some issue in our class, yeah. 

01:22:20
LUCY VAIL Do you think Mr. Martin might be open to that? 

01:22:20
ANTHONY I don't know, he's kinda crazy so I, I would hope so and I think he also doesn't want me to be throwing things at him anymore but - 

01:22:30
LUCY VAIL Right. 

01:22:30
ANTHONY I think if he is (inaudible ) from you may be. 

01:22:32
LUCY VAIL Okay, well, that's one idea I was thinking as I could run that by him with your permission is I would ask him about that. And I know we all have a meeting next week and I could ask him if he'd be open to us giving that a try. All right, so that's one thing we could do. Uhm, something along those lines I wanted to ask you was, is there like when you start to get really upset, right? Uhm, right before you're gonna-- use your language use-- have a tantrum, right or throw a tantrum. Is there anything that you notice in your body like some people tell me, oh, my heart races or I get sweaty palms or I get a headache or is there anything you notice in your body when you think of it? 

01:23:15
ANTHONY I think my palms get sweaty sometimes they just kinda-- I can feel my body tensing up like - 

01:23:20
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

01:23:20
ANTHONY - I can really just like, I get tense and angry. 

01:23:25
LUCY VAIL Right. Okay, awesome, all right. So in this moment, right in the moment where you get a signal, a body cue, you get a signal that you're about to get really upset, right? Or you know, throw a tantrum or-- that is a great moment where you could choose another behavior. I know you said that you feel like you don't have a choice that has control over you, uhm, but I also have some hope because I know you've been able to stop it before it gets physical, right? 

01:23:55
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:23:55
LUCY VAIL If we take one example, like let's say, Mr. Martin's classroom, uhm, is there anything you think of that you could do differently if you were able to kind of take a time out and recognize them in that moment? Is there anything you could do differently or... 

01:24:15
ANTHONY I ha-- I've tried everything that I've-- I've tried all kind of-- I tried to stop and kind of ignore him (inaudible ) ever more mad. I tried to just take a deep breath but then it just doesn't work for me. You just-- something he-- sometimes he just does things that really just anger me and I can't, I can't stop it, you know, I mean? 

01:24:30
LUCY VAIL Right, I get it, yeah, yeah, you've been struggling with this for a long time, huh? And it's hard to do something different. Uhm, don't think I don't get it cuz I totally do. It's really hard to do something different. I'm wondering about this idea of like just, just walking away, it's hard. So I'm warning you right now, it's super hard to do but I'm wondering if you'd be willing to just give it a try. 

01:24:50
ANTHONY Ah, I'm willing to try anything that will help at this point. 

01:24:55
LUCY VAIL Okay, so this is not gonna be easy. I'm telling you right off the bat. Okay, but if Mr. Martin was up for this thing where you could just step outside for like one minute, you've already told me that when you can step away or catch your breath or you take a moment that it's been really helpful to you. So I'm wondering if we should try that, try that with Mr. Martin for a little while and see if that might make a difference. 

01:25:15
ANTHONY I think (inaudible ). 

01:25:20
LUCY VAIL Okay, good. I think it's where the (inaudible ) do. I wanted to talk about this, uhm, thing about triggers for just a minute. And, uhm, do you have any idea what your triggers might be? Do you know what I mean by that triggers? 

01:25:40
ANTHONY Not really, can you explain? 

01:25:40
LUCY VAIL Yeah, so what I'm talking about, there are things, uhm, usually most people have a number of things, it can be a short list, it could be really long list of things that really pissed you off or things that really get you upset. And, uhm, like in Mr. Martin's classroom, okay, may be we could use that as an example. What's, what's one like trigger-- one thing that triggers you in Mr. Martin's classroom like the other day for example. 

01:26:10
ANTHONY Well, I know that sometimes he doesn't appreciate like he doesn't appreciate my work (inaudible ) that I really worked hard and I think that I did a really good job and I deserve a better grade than he gives me. And he just doesn't recognize it. 

01:26:20
LUCY VAIL Okay, in that moment, what are you feeling in that moment? What's it like? 

01:26:25
ANTHONY I feel like I'm not appreciated sometimes. 

01:26:30
LUCY VAIL Okay. So when you're not appreciated you feel that's, ah, a trigger for you? 

01:26:35
ANTHONY Oh, and my hard work is sort of not recognized. 

01:26:40
LUCY VAIL Okay. All right, so, uhm, taking that in mind, right? One thing I wanted to, uhm, just kind of look at for a second is usually, sometimes we can breakdown triggers into like external and internal triggers. And the reason I'm, I'm asking you look at this with me is because sometimes it's helpful to see what's kinda, kinda get you angry? What's gonna set you off? You know, these are the moments that, uhm, that anger and tantrums really kinda get the best of you and get you into trouble, right? So, uhm, external triggers are things on the outside that upset you like Mr. Martin not appreciating you or your sister like playing music you don't like or things like that, right? Internal triggers are things that either memories that you have or thoughts you have about yourself like for example sometimes like someone, uhm, I've had were, were people like get really angry and, uhm, have a lot of aggression in the classroom because they're taking a test and they're telling themself, I'm stupid, I'm never gonna be able to get this right. I'm never gonna be able to get this right. That's an internal trigger and then they get really, really upset. So does that make any sense to you? 

01:28:00
ANTHONY Yeah, I think, I think (inaudible ) more external like - 

01:28:05
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

01:28:05
ANTHONY - it's the things that other people do to me like I don't-- my internal triggers don't really set me off if that makes any sense. 

01:28:10
LUCY VAIL Yeah, yeah, that makes perfect sense. Well, that's great, you know, that's more information is better, huh. We can use that. Well, I have to say that all the stuff that you've talked about so far has kinda given me some hope, what about for you? 

01:28:25
ANTHONY It's definitely really open my eyes that there might be some hope and I might be able to control myself a little more. 

01:28:30
LUCY VAIL Right. So what do you think just to kinda take at-- take a, a breather here for a second. We've been talking about the recent incident with Mr. Martin and things that have happened at home. We talked a little bit about, uhm, the history of anger in your family and that kind of thing. We talked about this to these tantrums, getting the best of you and kind of getting you into some trouble. Uhm, looking at body cues and triggers, stuff like that. So with everything that we've been looking at so far, what do you think you're telling yourself about it at this point? Have any ideas? 

01:29:10
ANTHONY I mean, I think I definitely have a little bit more hope that I might be able to change and there might be tools that I can use to may be move forward instead of just keep moving back and taking further steps back. 

01:29:30
LUCY VAIL Okay, great. Well, that's good news, huh, a little bit of hope. 

01:29:30
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:29:30
LUCY VAIL I'll take a little bit of hope, little hope is not bad, right? Uhm, sometimes people find it helpful and I hope you will tell me if you do not think that this would be helpful, you'll be truthful with me. Okay. Sometimes people think it's helpful to think of like a little something that they could say to themselves, ah, not out loud to yourself when, uhm, you get in that critical moment where you're gonna try to make a choice for a better behavior like stepping out of Mr. Martin's class for example. Some people think it's helpful to-- where they find it's helpful to say a little something to themselves like I can do this or like, uhm, I'm gonna get through this or, ah, you know, I'm not gonna let it get the best of me right now or do you think that would be helpful at all to you? 

01:30:25
ANTHONY I'm definitely willing to try it. 

01:30:25
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

01:30:25
ANTHONY But I'm not sure that that's really gonna be enough for me. 

01:30:30
LUCY VAIL Okay, well let's see, let's take that as one first step. Right, you already, you have like, ah, a lot of things you're gonna try to do differently this week, right? 

01:30:40
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:30:40
LUCY VAIL Or in the next couple weeks of Mr. Martin so, what's one thing that make sense you that you could tell yourself? 

01:30:45
ANTHONY Calm down, this isn't the end of the world. 

01:30:50
LUCY VAIL Okay, calm down this isn't the end of the world. All right, that's good. So I was kinda wondering how you Anthony feel you're doing in all this right about now. 

01:31:05
ANTHONY I'm definitely doing a lot better about myself than when we started. I mean, I still feel like I have a long way to go and that there's-- it's still gonna be kind of a long haul for me but I definitely feel like I gotten some more tools that will help me. 

01:31:20
LUCY VAIL Excellent. What do you think about the statement you made just a little while ago that anger had total control of-- I think you said total control, did you or did I make that up? 

01:31:30
ANTHONY I think I said, yeah. 

01:31:35
LUCY VAIL Okay, uhm, what do you think about that? 

01:31:35
ANTHONY I think my opinion has changed a little bit. I think after talking through it I've realized that to some extent I do have control over certain aspects of my anger and that I might be able to control it more with some helpful tools. 

01:31:55
LUCY VAIL Okay. So you have a little bit hope? 

01:31:55
ANTHONY A little bit, yeah. 

01:32:00
LUCY VAIL Yeah. If you, uhm, let's say we met for a little while, okay, like three months. Is that too long Anthony? Three months, is that over to think of-- okay, all right, all right. One month, okay - 

01:32:10
ANTHONY I'll give you a month, I'll give you a month. 

01:32:15
LUCY VAIL - let's say le-- okay, you give me a month, thanks. If we met for one month and everybody agreed, your parents, Mr. Martin, you and I agreed that we don't need to meet anymore because everything is going much better I assume. What would that look like for you? Can you describe that for me for a minute? 

01:32:35
ANTHONY What do you mean what it look like for me? 

01:32:35
LUCY VAIL What I mean is how would things be going with Mr. Martin or how would things be going with your sister? 

01:32:45
ANTHONY Ideally, I think we would all sort of get along better and we wouldn't have these arguments and these issues when I have to come in all the time and everything would be a lot more peaceful. It would be more peaceful world for me. 

01:33:00
LUCY VAIL Okay. And would your interactions be like with Mr. Martin? I guess what I'm asking is I'm asking if you kinda dream, in your wildest dreams. I know okay, you might not be like going out to eat with Mr. Martin or you know, having him over your house for Christmas, okay that might not-- might never go there. But if you were to dream for a moment, how would your relationship be with Mr. Martin a month down the road and... 

01:33:25
ANTHONY More humane, uhm... 

01:33:25
LUCY VAIL Okay, more humane, what would that look like? 

01:33:30
ANTHONY I would be very-- more calm, we wouldn't fight, we wouldn't have these arguments in the middle of class. We wouldn't have to interrupt class to workout issues. 

01:33:40
LUCY VAIL Okay, can you imagine that at all or how are you doing? 

01:33:45
ANTHONY I'd like to imagine it, yeah. 

01:33:45
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

01:33:45
ANTHONY It could be-- I'd be nice. 

01:33:45
LUCY VAIL All right. So while I hear you saying, even though you might not be imagining it right now, you have hope that you could imagine it. 

01:33:55
ANTHONY Yeah. 

01:33:55
LUCY VAIL Okay, all right, well, I'll take it. That's good enough.

Microtraining Associates Presents 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents Shannon Kellogg Psy.D. and Lucy Vail, MFT Shannon Kellogg Psy.D. 

01:35:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Welcome to 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents. In this video we'll review five key components of working with teens. The first and most important stage of working with an adolescent is building rapport. So this means building a strong trusting relationship with the teen and having a good working alliance. Next, we'll review with an adolescent who's struggling with depression and adolescent who's having difficulties with anger management and adolescent who's having trouble with anxiety. Lastly, we'll demonstrate how I work with the teen in a school setting. Even if you're not working directly in a school setting, we'll demonstrate how to work effectively with parents and teachers. When people ask me why I enjoy working with adolescents and kids, my answer is honestly that I genuinely like them and that's one of the most important aspects of working with this population is really liking who you're working with. So you know, getting along well with teenagers, being able to connect with younger people that's essential and it's not for everybody and that's okay. But for people who enjoy it and who love doing it, teenagers will really respond to that because they can tell us if you like them and that is the first and most important step of any working relationship. My experience has included a wide variety of settings over the past ten years in working with teens and adolescents thus, it include my post doctoral works supervising, ah, family and youth parent partnership program, working in a school setting, ah, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings, ah, with kids, adolescents and families. I've also taught at the college and graduate school level teaching courses of psychology, helping skills and introduction to psychotherapy and marriage and family counseling. 

01:36:45
Lucy Vail MFT 

01:36:50
LUCY VAIL I have really enjoyed working with adolescents for over 20 years even before becoming an MFT, I worked with adolescents in prevention in programs in Boston, in the public housing projects. We had groups of adolescents that met right within their own public housing project and we are able to use alternative interventions like art therapy, hatha yoga, meditation, music and to build resiliencies and promote a healthier lifestyle. Then as an MFT, I've worked with teens in a school setting, in and outpatient mental health clinic and also in day treatment for, uhm, with teens that had such severe emotional struggles that they weren't able to function in a traditional school setting. I think this is one of the most difficult stages in life, it's the streaky transition going from childhood to adulthood. And I guess I have a certain real compassion for this difficult stage and I really enjoy working with adolescents and helping them make this transition successfully whatever that means for them into a healthy successful adulthood. My approach with adolescents is client centered and narrative. I think it's a critical first stage to spend time joining and building rapport with adolescents. And I do this by using unconditional positive regard, uhm, being nonjudgmental, being very present and genuinely curious with the adolescent and discovering-- being genuinely curious about their story and their unique perspective. 

01:38:35
Working with Adolescents and Anxiety 

01:38:40
SHANNON KELLOGG In working with Madelene(ph) I used the combination of CBT and mindfulness and acceptance techniques. CBT helps to identify her cognitions and distortions in thinking such as catastrophizing or dichotomous thinking. And using mindfulness to be able to distance and gain perspective on her thoughts and emotions have non-judgmental acceptance and come back to the here and now. We first explore the different areas of anxiety related to her ideas about being perfect and wanting to please her family and her friends. We talk about what her triggers are, what causes her to feel the most anxiety about herself and her future. She finds that her triggers are sometimes the media, watching the idea of a perfect person on TV with a perfect wife, the perfect boyfriend as well as feeling like her friends have it all and that it comes really easily to them. So she has this really idealized image of how life should be and how she believes other should view her and how she should be. We talk about her idea of being accepted and what it would take to be good enough. I administer her (inaudible ) which helps us be able to evaluate the specifics of what's going on in these examples. So for instance when she endorses the idea that she tends to focus on her flaws and dismiss her own achievements. I'm able to ask her about examples of when this has happened. And we're able to help her identify the fact that she is really overly focusing on the negative flaws and totally dismissing all these great achievements that she's had. And oftentimes people who are anxious and perfectionistic they tend to have a really strong belief that their flaws and their difficulties are who they are. And their achievements are very much minimized. So this is a cognitive distortion so we have to point out that this is a distortion and often they have expectations of themselves that are quite unrealistic and often entertainable. When we're able to recalibrate the expectations that the anxiety and the perfectionism has caused they're able to have more room for being imperfect. And they're able to see that their self-worth is not related to being perfect and having everything perfectly controlled. A lot of times with anxiety, adolescents want to have everything planned out and controlled so they feel like they're able to control the future and what happens. And the truth is, is that we need to be able to tolerate difficult emotions and tolerate when things go wrong. So part of our work together in this session is showing that things have gone wrong in the past and she's able-- she's been able to tolerate it. Uhm, when things go wrong, it's not the end of world and a difficult negative emotion such as feeling upset, disappointed or shame it's a temporary feeling and it will pass. And so we're able to increase her emotional tolerance for that negative affect and show her that, that negative affect will pass and she'll be able to kind of get through it and be stronger afterwards. Another key intervention in working with this client is being able to challenge her assumptions about what makes feel good enough. She often has much higher standards and expectations of herself than anyone else. She assumes that her mother or friends are expecting things of her in order to be good enough when in fact that's not a reality. Part of my work with her is being to suggest to her that the expectations that she has placed on herself may not be a one to one correlation with what other people really expect of her. Uhm, in this case, the client's mother had actually called me and was really concern because she did place so much pressure on herself. And in fact the client was able to recognize that in some cases, the pressure is coming from her and not from external sources. So a lot of times, uhm, I'll work with a teen or adolescent and I'll help them recognize that whether you're perfect or not, your friends and family are going to love you. And you love them regardless of-- they're perfect and so you have to be able to give yourself the room to make mistakes or do things wrong. It's just part of being human and knowing that you can tolerate that when do go wrong.

4 Key Interventions for Working with Anxiety Identifying anxious thoughts and unrealistic perfectionistic beliefs Identify triggers for beliefs Increase flexibility in thinking Increasing self-efficacy Increase emotional tolerance Relaxation training 

01:43:10
SHANNON KELLOGG The four key interventions in working with Madelene(ph) include, first identifying her anxious thoughts and unrealistic perfectionistic beliefs. This might include her thoughts about my whole future depends on this test. I can't handle the pressure, everyone expects me to score 100%, I'll let everyone down. Next we identify triggers for her beliefs, this includes being judge by others, having uncertainty about her future and feeling insecure about a new situation. Next, we increase flexibility in thinking by asking question such as, what's the worst that can happen? Are there times in the past when you've had difficulties? Have you handled this before? When we increase flexibility in thinking we're able to increase the client self-efficacy. Increasing self-efficacy is the next step. We ask questions about, how did you handle difficult situations in the past? Where are the qualities that your friends or family like about you? Next, we work to increase emotional tolerance. We discuss how feeling emotion such as shame or embarrassment in the past have always passed and shall be able to get through difficult emotions. The feelings will pass and you can handle them. Last, we focus on a key aspect of working with teens who have anxiety, relaxation training. This includes deep breathing and often includes progressive massive relaxation. When the teen is able to train herself to relax and have control of her breathing and difficult anxiety provoking situations, she is able to manage her stress and calm down the physiological reaction of anxiety in her body. 

01:44:55
Helping Skills Attending, listening, and observing Psychoeducation Using challenges Open-ended questions 

01:44:55
SHANNON KELLOGG The helping skills I demonstrated in this session are adapted by Clara Hill's helping skills model. The first skill is attending, listening and observing skills which helped to be able to identify the core cognitive distortions. In this case, I ask more about situations when she's feeling anxious when the anxiety is worse, when it starts and I'm able to really clarify the situations that I understand her anxiety and perfectionistic traits. The next skill that I demonstrate is psychoeducation, helping clients to identify and use relaxation skills and techniques that will help the physiological effects of anxiety. Next, I demonstrate the skill of using challenges in order to gain insight. In this example, we talk about the snowball effect. We help the client to identify the initial dichotomous thinking before it snowballs into a larger catastrophic feeling of failure. Next, I use open-ended questions for exploration. I ask the client non-judgmentally about the situations in which she feels most anxious and has the most perfectionistic tendencies. A final note in working with teenage girls with anxiety. It's often important to recognize other emotions that may be present due to socialization and expectations about how girls should behave in the world. There are certain emotions that are sometimes less acceptable such as anger or sadness. When we're able to identify the other emotions and be able to process those in a healthy way, a lot of times the anxiety in the teen is decreased as a function of learning how to really process their emotions. 

01:46:50
SHANNON KELLOGG So tell me more about what's been worrying you, what's been on your mind? 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, I just started high school so it's, it's been exciting but, uhm, - 

01:46:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:47:00
UNKNOWN - it's you know, it's, it's different. 

01:47:00
Open-ended question for exploration 

01:47:00
SHANNON KELLOGG It's different. 

01:47:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:47:00
SHANNON KELLOGG What's been different? 

01:47:05
UNKNOWN Ah, everything you know, new friends, - 

01:47:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:47:05
UNKNOWN - new school, it's bigger. 

01:47:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

01:47:10
UNKNOWN Uhm, the classes are a little bit tougher but... 

01:47:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Tell me more about the classes, they're tougher, they're more difficult. 

01:47:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, uhm, you know, the, the teachers I feel like have a different style, they, uhm, (inaudible ) in those school I don't think they cared so much. Well, not that they didn't care but they believe, okay, if you don't do all and this you saw other things that will be better but in high school it's, uhm, you know there's definitely a lot of like important place on tests - 

01:47:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:47:45
UNKNOWN - and homework, assignments and everything, I don't... 

01:47:45
Listening and attending 

01:47:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Right, yeah, it sounds like it's a big change. 

01:47:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:47:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, so tell me more about-- last week you talked about that you were feeling kind of worried about some of the test and that's when you get the most worried. 

01:47:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:48:00
SHANNON KELLOGG What happens with that? 

01:48:00
UNKNOWN Uhm, even thinking about test kind of makes me a little bit anxious. 

01:48:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:48:05
UNKNOWN But, ah, I start out feeling like okay, I, I can do this it's, it's gonna be, it's gonna be different this time because you know, I haven't had the best kind of time taking them. 

01:48:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

01:48:20
UNKNOWN But, uhm, getting closer, I, I get really anxious it's harder for me to eat. Uhm, sleeping is tough, I-- I'm kind of averaging like five, six hours of sleep because all I can think about is my test the next day and sorry, even my palms are sweating just thinking about it. 

01:48:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:48:40
UNKNOWN And sometimes my throat kind of you know, like gets-- it's hard for me to breath sometimes. 

01:48:50
Listening and attending 

01:48:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. So you get really, really nervous. 

01:48:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:48:50
SHANNON KELLOGG And when does it start-- when do you start noticing that happening? 

01:48:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, it, it really depends. It-- if it's a quiz it's kind of like the moment when I walk into the classroom or the periods building up when I'm like nervously flipping through my homework and, and my test prep-- my test (inaudible ) stuff but, uhm, on days when it's a big unit test - 

01:49:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:49:20
UNKNOWN - it's, it's probably two, three days before and - 

01:49:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

01:49:20
UNKNOWN - it's, it's usually all I can really think about most nights. 

01:49:25
Identifying anxious thoughts 

01:49:25
SHANNON KELLOGG What do you think about when you're you know, up at night and you can't sleep? 

01:49:30
UNKNOWN I think about, I think about how important the test is, how it's gonna mess everything up if I don't do well. 

01:49:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Why do you worry or get messed up? 

01:49:45
UNKNOWN I just, I just feel like if I don't do well on my tests then, ah, it's kind of stupid but I feel like my future is, is kind of bleak and - 

01:50:00
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:50:00
UNKNOWN - it's, it's, it's going to go on a downward spiral from there. 

01:50:05
Identify cognitive distortions 

01:50:05
SHANNON KELLOGG So downward spiral what, what does that mean? Why do you worry what will happen? 

01:50:10
UNKNOWN If I don't do well on this test then I'm not gonna do on the class and if I failed then I can't do my sports so I get caught out of my sports, all of my club activities and I might have to drop out of high school if it gets worse and if I failed multiple test and multiple classes then it just-- I'm just worried that it, it'll get to the point where my parents are you know, are gonna be like embarrassed of me and I don't like disappointing them. 

01:50:45
SHANNON KELLOGG What do you worry about in terms of disappointing them? 

01:50:45
UNKNOWN I just-- I wanna be that daughter that they deserve to have. They, they worked really hard to make sure that I have you know, the clothes and, and having enough food and having a nice place to live. And I feel like if I don't, if I don't do perfect, if I don't get those straight A's I, I basically made all of their hard work worthless. 

01:51:15
Restatement and clarification 

01:51:15
SHANNON KELLOGG It sounds like your parents have done a lot for you and it means a lot to you to have their approval and I wonder what that would look like. What do you think their warning of you? 

01:51:25
UNKNOWN I think they warn-- you know, how moms kind of have the book clubs and then it's not actually about the books sometimes it's about drinking wine other times - 

01:51:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:51:40
UNKNOWN - it's about you know, talking about their kids. I feel like that's the most (inaudible ). 

01:51:43
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

01:51:43
UNKNOWN I, I wanna be that kid who, who the mom is so proud to talk about at her book club. 

01:51:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:51:50
UNKNOWN Or the dad talks about when he's at playing golf with his friends, the straight A's, uhm, and all the activities got into an Ivy League eventually may be one day finds a great job at the same time maintaining this kind of booming social life. 

01:52:10
Refocusing on client 

01:52:10
SHANNON KELLOGG So I hear what your idea is and what your parents want from you. What about you? What do you expect of yourself? 

01:52:20
UNKNOWN I think I kind of want you know, the same thing. I-- you watch these movies and all of my favorite characters are that you know, kind of perfect person. The, the girl with the straight glossy hair, she's beautiful, she has a lot of friends, she has you know, the best looking boyfriend at school. I know it's all kind of stupid but, uhm, she, she's you know, super smart kind of has everything go her way almost seems that she doesn't have to try for it. 

01:52:55
Identifying triggers for thought about ideal self 

01:52:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Is that what you're wanting for yourself to have this, this perfect grades, the perfect boyfriend, uhm, and sort of effortlessly just have everything. 

01:53:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, doesn't everyone want that? I, I don't, I don't know, I mean it, it kind of seems like everyone wants that but and a lot of my friends seem to have it. 

01:53:20
SHANNON KELLOGG So tell me more about-- I mean, what would it look like if you are to feel like you have everything you want. What would that-- what would be different about your life? What would be the same? 

01:53:35
UNKNOWN I, I think everything would be kind of easier. Uhm, if I can loose that extra five pounds, if I can-- if my grade goes up. If I score perfect, 100% on the tests if you look everything it, it's just-- it's easier. 

01:53:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:53:55
UNKNOWN And I don't have to try so hard may be next time and I, I can get more sleep and... 

01:54:00
Identifying intensity and duration of anxious thoughts 

01:54:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Do you spend a lot time thinking about those things or wishing things were different? 

01:54:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, uhm, you know, (inaudible ) group that I'm in it's kind of impossible not to compare myself with other-- with everyone else. Uhm, at night (inaudible ) I don't really get much sleep, it's, it's really all I can think about is how-- that's, that's everything they wanna be and I, I just feel like I'm not good enough or I, I can't get there and I feel like I'm trying so hard and I just, I just can't get there. 

01:54:35
Disclosure of insight 

01:54:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. Wow, so it sounds like there are so many high expectations that you have on yourself and I think that it can be so easy to look at other people and feel like they have it all and that things are effortless for them but a lot of times they might be feeling just as worried or insecure as you sometimes feel. Uhm, and it sounds like you have the-- this idea of how you should be in order to kind of feel good enough. And I wonder if you, ah, a lot harder on yourself and anybody else would ever be. 

01:55:10
UNKNOWN How-- I don't know, I just-- I, I feel like-- I, I truly understand what you're saying about how you know, it might not look so easy but I mean, I'm, I'm with my friends a lot of the times and it just, it just seems-- doesn't seem like they have to try. 

01:55:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

01:55:30
UNKNOWN And may be because they're so perfect that they don't have to be hard on themselves. I just feel like this might be the only way, that makes any sense. 

01:55:40
SHANNON KELLOGG So you feel like you have to be really hard on yourself in order to get yourself to, to be the way that you feel like you should be? 

01:55:45
UNKNOWN Right. I, I think setting high goals and having a high expectation of myself is, is the only way to kind of get to meet that you know, meet that place that-- where I wanna go and... 

01:56:00
Perfectionism Quiz: Identifying specific thoughts 

01:56:05
SHANNON KELLOGG You know, a lot of the expectations you have of yourself it seems like, uhm, you have a lot of pressure that you place on yourself. And I have a quiz that I made, uhm, that will help me better understand kind of what sort of thoughts you have inter-- that are surrounding the anxiety you might have or some of the pressure you put on yourself. So if you want to just look at these questions, uhm, and just answer yes or no and you know, just answer your initial kinda go with your (inaudible ) when you're reading the questions. And then I'll just give us some more information, uhm, that I'll-- you know, more what's going on. 

01:56:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:56:45
SHANNON KELLOGG There you go. 

01:56:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:56:50
SHANNON KELLOGG All right. So let's just go through each one that you check yes to and I'll ask you more about it. So you said that you try to anticipate things prior to when they happen. Ah, so when does that happen? 

01:57:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, it's, it's kind of happened like with everything that I do. My friends, my mom always kind of tease me for being sort of a control freak. 

01:57:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

01:57:15
UNKNOWN Uhm, I, I like knowing that, I like knowing that everything is gonna be okay. 

01:57:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

01:57:20
UNKNOWN I like planning everything, uhm, to (inaudible ) that's why I, I set up the study schedule before because I know that if I, if I can crack down it and know that all of this is gonna be on the test then if I know that material through and through then I'm going to get an end. I can just make sure that, that I have-- that everything is perfect, I guess. 

01:57:45
SHANNON KELLOGG It sounds like it kind of gives you a sense of security like you can may be control things better if they're really planned out. 

01:57:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I, I wil-- I would definitely say so, uhm, I mean, for the times where I haven't plan, uhm, where I just kind of grow up and I kind of forget, it just-- I, I, I get even more anxious. 

01:58:05
Challenges to gain insight 

01:58:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Well, tell me more about the times that you've screwed up because I mean, I can't imagine, it's, it's really impossible that anybody would be perfect all the time. I mean, I certainly make mistakes a lot and it just sort of part of-- it's part of life, you know, it's just kind of part of being human. And so I wonder-- I mean, looking back to times when you might have made mistakes or things didn't go you know, the way you wanted them to. Tell me about what happened. 

01:58:30
UNKNOWN There have been moments where I just kind of like slip off. I forget to-- I read the wrong the chapter or I kind studied the wrong material. I've, I've gotten like C on reading quizzes before and, uhm... 

01:58:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay, and what happened when you got the C? 

01:58:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, well, I was annoyed obviously but I mean, it was okay because I ended up getting in there anyway but... 

01:58:55
SHANNON KELLOGG So it sounds like I mean, it felt bad, now entirely you want-- you know, you're like okay, I wish hadn't gotten a C but in the end you know, it kind of worked out. You, you're still able to kind of you know, you passed your class and everything was okay. 

01:59:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:59:10
Psychoeducation: Recognizing and challenging distortions 

01:59:10
SHANNON KELLOGG I think you know, sometimes the feeling of disappointment, uhm, is really strong but sometimes feelings are stronger than the actual reality of like what's happening. So it might feel overwhelming and feel like, oh, my gosh, it's the end of world but it's actually not the end of the world and sometimes once a little bit of time passes we realize, okay, that wasn't so bad, I got through it and you know, it wasn't the end of the world you know. Uhm, and I think it's hard to remember that it's not the end of the world in that moment and it sounds like you're worry about happening again is that this time if something goes wrong it will be the end of the world, right? 

01:59:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:59:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Cuz you talked about being worried that like you know, you'd get a C or you wouldn't pass your whole class and then you wouldn't get into college, right? So it, it really gets overwhelming. It's called the snowball effect where like one little worry, it starts kind of small and then it like snowballs and it gets bigger and bigger you know. And one of the things that we can do is we can help you remember that, hey, this could be a snowball and we don't want it to get totally out of control and you can help yourself kind of stop it before it starts rolling, right? 

02:00:20
UNKNOWN I swear, I've never really thought about it like that before. 

02:00:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Does that make sense like what I'm saying with the snowball thing? 

02:00:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:00:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

02:00:25
UNKNOWN You know, because, uhm, my, my mom also teases me on that of many things that she kind of makes fun of me for - 

02:00:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

02:00:35
UNKNOWN - in a nice way but, uhm, how I seem to blow things out of proportion sometimes but I, I think just like in the moment like you were saying it just-- it gets really overwhelming. 

02:00:45
Increasing affect tolerance 

02:00:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, it feels really bad. And you know, as you learn to kind of recognize that hey, this is just a feeling and it's actually not a reflection of anything about you. It feels worse than it is that feeling will get smaller as time goes on you'll be able to kind of handle things like that better and you'll notice that it doesn't bother you as much you know. So there's ways that you can kind of break that, that pattern, you know, uhm, it just take some practice. So you said that you tend to dismiss your own achievements and concentrate instead on the flaws. Can you give me an example of that? 

02:01:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, I just-- sometimes I feel like the flaws are just so much more out there you know. 

02:01:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

02:01:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, I mean, it sounds that I-- there haven't been good things that happen to me. I went to homecoming with the person I really wanted to - 

02:01:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Oh. 

02:01:40
UNKNOWN - and, uhm, I was nominated for homecoming queens that was really nice - 

02:01:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Oh, my gosh. 

02:01:45
UNKNOWN - and, ah, homecoming princess, sorry. 

02:01:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

02:01:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, which was exciting but I, I think-- I get really caught up in, in the school and everything and sometimes it seems like the things that are wrong or like what, what I look back on my day. I really focus on those-- that little thing that didn't go right. 

02:02:05
SHANNON KELLOGG I see. So there might be ten things that go really well and that you do really well and it's the one thing that kind of is off that you're more focus on. 

02:02:10
UNKNOWN Right and I, I feel like it just makes me sound horrible. Uhm, and I, I realize that you know, that the problem and I should be a bit more thankful for a lot of the blessings that I have had but I just-- I'm not really the person that I wanna be you know. And, uhm, I feel like those little mistakes are-- it's, it's what's preventing me from getting there. 

02:02:40
Immediacy and self-disclosure 

02:02:40
SHANNON KELLOGG It sounds like even talking about it right now you're being really hard on yourself and saying, you know, ah, I should be more thankful for that and it's that kind of critical way of thinking about yourself that it's really hard for me to even hear because I feel like you've got all these great things going for you and you are so hard on yourself. And I wonder if you know, when you hear me saying that, saying that there's always other great things about you, are you able to kind of-- does that bring true for you? 

02:03:10
UNKNOWN Uhm, I don't know sometimes I kinda feel like people are just saying it to say, you know, - 

02:03:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Really? 

02:03:15
UNKNOWN - because, ah, it, it's kind of like when you're younger - 

02:03:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Ah. 

02:03:20
UNKNOWN - and, and you're on the soccer team and someone, someone totally messes up the goal or something like they're goal keeper and, and there was an easy shot and they just completely messed it up but everyone is like, oh, you're so great, don't worry and it's, it's that kind of conceit you know, try-- trying to make them feel better even though you know that they didn't really do that well. I, I feel like people when they're complementing me it's, it-- it's not totally genuine. 

02:03:50
SHANNON KELLOGG So you're dismissing your own achievements and you feel like the feedback you get from other people is that they're just being nice. But what I wanna help you realize is that you have accomplished a lot and there are a lot of really great qualities that you have and there are times that you'll make mistakes and it's all okay you're still the kind of person who, uhm, people really like being around and it sounds like your friends and family are there for you even when things don't go so well. So I think that you feel like there is this way in which if you're not perfect or you don't have this you know, uhm, you know, perfect grades or the perfect life that they'll somehow be disappointed in you. And I think that it's-- that's not really the case. It sounds to me like people love you for who you are, you know, and we just have to work on you being able to recognize that hey, I've got a lot of great things on and there are some things that you know, are not always gonna be perfect. 

02:04:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:04:45
SHANNON KELLOGG Uhm, I wonder you know, you are saying that you kind of dismiss some of the achievements that you've had. Looking back, are there any things that you've accomplish that you feel really proud of that you've done? 

02:05:00
UNKNOWN Uhm, well, I-- we've had some class (inaudible ) sometimes and, uhm, it always makes me feel good when the teacher always ask me to go first because he knows that I do a good job on it or, uhm, I was-- I made a (inaudible ) time on my swim team and - 

02:05:22
SHANNON KELLOGG Wow. 

02:05:22
UNKNOWN - and that was really exciting. It, it's those things like that, that, that I'm, I'm, I'm kind of proud of but I don't really wanna brag about it or anything. 

02:05:30
Focusing on strengths and resiliency 

02:05:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Wow! So you just listed a lot of different things that you have done it that sound really cool. I mean the debate, from what I know of debate it can be pretty intense there is a lot of pressure and you have to think on your feet. So I mean you must be out there and just debating and able to think fast. 

02:05:50
UNKNOWN I, I don't know, I really like doing it and, uhm, I guess different from test is like when, when I first start thinking about it I really get nervous but, uhm, in test it's like me versus this paper that my teacher made. 

02:06:05
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

02:06:05
UNKNOWN And when I'm in the-- a debate I'm against human that I know in my class and I don't know I'm just, I'm just able to do a better job in them. 

02:06:15
SHANNON KELLOGG So it sounds like you have this confidence where you feel really good about what you have to say and you're able to really just show it you know, you kinda bring it. 

02:06:25
UNKNOWN I guess so. I don't really know. 

02:06:25
SHANNON KELLOGG That's really cool. I would love to see you in a debate. I would-- can we like tape it sometimes so I can see? 

02:06:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, ah, okay. 

02:06:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay, may not, I won't do that to you but I just-- I love hearing about it sounds like you just have so much confidence and you really kinda own it, you know. It sounds really neat. 

02:06:45
UNKNOWN I guess so. I don't-- I don't know. I feel kind of embarrassed talking about it. 

02:06:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Uhm, I feel like when there are things that are really exciting like that whether it's swim team or whether it's you know doing a really long debate. I wanna be able to celebrate that with you and I mean these are really neat things cuz you know, it's like life is so sure and when we focus on the negative stuff, it really bugs us down. And then when you talk about all those other cool stuff that you've done that's like to me it's just amazing. I mean, are you able to kind of enjoy that when it happens, what? 

02:07:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, I mean definitely in a moment there is-- there's like the time where it just happens and I'm so happy and I feel like all of my hard work paid off but then - 

02:07:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

02:07:30
UNKNOWN - uhm, I kind of get into this like, oh, onto the next thing, what about all these other things and... 

02:07:35
SHANNON KELLOGG So you're just onto the next thing that you want it. 

02:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:07:35
SHANNON KELLOGG So you push yourself. It's hard to step back and just enjoy what you've kind of-- what you've had. 

02:07:45
UNKNOWN Also I just, you know, you see some of those people who brag all the time and I don't wanna be one of those people. 

02:07:50
Reframing self-esteem; Encouraging new ways of thinking 

02:07:50
SHANNON KELLOGG I don't think you ever have to worry about bragging too much. To me it sounds like you are the opposite of someone who brags, you really dismiss what you-- you dismissed what you've accomplished and I don't think you ever have to worry about (inaudible ) who brags. I would encourage you to try and brag more because you have a lot to be proud of and I get it that you don't wanna come off as full of yourself but it's okay to give yourself a pat on the back, you know and you need to do that. So even though there'll be a voice inside of your head saying, oh, don't brag, let it go. Don't worry about that. I don't think that's gonna be a problem. So I wanted to go back to something that you said about your parents earlier, uhm, you said that it seems like your mom has this really high expectations and you want to them to be able to kind of be proud of you, right? And from talking to your mom on the phone, I got the impression that she was so proud of you and was actually worried about you that you're placing so much pressure on yourself. 

02:08:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, yeah, I mean (inaudible ) talk about it with me before I think that's why she wanted me to come here. 

02:08:55
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, and would you be open to her coming in the session sometimes so we can talk about some of these things? 

02:09:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I definitely would, uhm, sh-- you know, her opinion means a lot to me and - 

02:09:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Uh-hmm. 

02:09:10
UNKNOWN - I feel like sometimes, uhm, this whole like me being stressed out all the time put some stress on our relationship. So I would definitely want to talk to her or talk with her. 

02:09:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Talk with her. 

02:09:20
UNKNOWN Specially when there's you know, someone else. 

02:09:25
Encouraging new interpersonal skills 

02:09:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Sure and I can help you figure out you know, what, what we wanna accomplish when we all meet together, uhm, because the sense-- I had the sense that she was very proud of you and would be really open to talking with you. She said, you know, if we ever want her come in she's happy to do that. So I'm so glad to hear that you're, that you're open to that because sometimes what we think that others are thinking of us is not always really what they actually think you know, and so it's nice to be able to hear what her thoughts actually are and, uhm, and so I'm glad you're open to that. When you were talking about, uhm, kind of the tightness in your throat and kind of feeling shaky when you get more anxious. One of the things, uhm, that can sometimes be very helpful is to do deep breathing. Uhm, have you ever had any experience of like breaking or any type of relaxation stuff? 

02:10:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, yeah, I've done yoga before a couple of times. 

02:10:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Ah, okay. 

02:10:20
UNKNOWN Just like a couple of classes with my friends and, uhm, - 

02:10:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

02:10:25
UNKNOWN - and some team where my friends (inaudible ) wanted-- uhm, our coach recommended that I think we tried some and, uhm, at the beginning and at the end we kind of go through like these breathing patterns and things. 

02:10:40
Relaxation skills 

02:10:40
SHANNON KELLOGG So do you think that, that type of breathing might be helpful for you. Is that saying that you are willing to kind of learn with me, I can teach you more about how to do it. 

02:10:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, definitely. 

02:10:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay, uhm, because the idea behind the deep breathing is that when you're feeling really anxious and shaky, if you're able to kind of put your body into relaxation mode, uhm, it's not compatible with being anxious. So if you can, uhm, teach yourself to kind of relax through the breathing then those other feelings of the tightness and your throat will kind of go away, right? Uhm, and so the more you practice, the more you're able to kinda turn that on and help your body relax. Uhm, so let's go through and we'll kinda teach you how to do it and then we'll talk more about it. So what you wanna do is just kind of, uhm, relax and put your feet on the ground and, uhm, we'll start by acknowledging that every breath we take, we want to be really slow and deep breaths. So imagine as if you're kind of filling up a balloon or blowing out a candle, how you kind of wanna extend the breath. And you'll breathe in to your nose and out to your mouth. And I'm gonna have you place one hand on your stomach and as you breathe in to your nose you'll notice that we want your stomach to expand kind of like the air is filling up your stomach. And then when you breathe out, uhm, your stomach will kind of come in and you'll feel your hand move a-- as you push out the breath slowly to your mouth. So let's try three deep breaths together. So first into our nose, you feel the air filling up your stomach. 

02:12:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:12:20
SHANNON KELLOGG And out through your mouth and in to your nose. Hold it and out of your mouth. And one more time in to your nose, feel your stomach expand and hold it and out through your mouth. And let's do one more, in and one more out. Okay, so how was that for you? 

02:13:10
UNKNOWN It feels good, it, it remind a lot about, uhm, I was talking earlier about the yoga and stuff and things afterward-- afterwards. 

02:13:15
Open question for behavioral activation/change 

02:13:15
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, okay. I mean, do you think, do you think that, that would be helpful for you? 

02:13:20
UNKNOWN I think so because every time I, I leave a class at-- or say yoga class - 

02:13:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

02:13:20
UNKNOWN - I always (inaudible ). 

02:13:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Right. 

02:13:25
UNKNOWN And even though we only did it a couple like a couple of times I kind of felt myself going back to that place where I'm just kind of you know (inaudible ) my, my body is, is more relaxed. 

02:13:40
Relaxation scheduling 

02:13:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah, and what's, what's close that you can do to deep breathing anywhere so if you're in class before a task, if you're out with your friends and you start to notice that you're feeling nervous or if you notice your tight, ah, tightness in your throat you can do the deep breathing and nobody will know and it kinda helps your body just get back into that relax mode. And what I would recommend is also finding it a time during the day that you can practice it. That way when you do the deep breathing, your body kind of recognizes that okay, this is relaxation time. When do you think would be a good time to merely practice or when do you think that would work? 

02:14:20
UNKNOWN I think I should do it, uhm, probably in the morning cuz - 

02:14:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

02:14:25
UNKNOWN - sometimes I'm feeling little frazzled like thinking about all the stuff that I have to do that day. 

02:14:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Yeah. 

02:14:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, definitely before a test. 

02:14:30
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

02:14:30
UNKNOWN And, uhm, probably at night may be - 

02:14:35
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

02:14:35
UNKNOWN - because, uhm, hopefully it will help me get a better sleep than I've been getting recently. 

02:14:40
SHANNON KELLOGG Right. I hope you kinda relax so that you're able to, to sleep better. 

02:14:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:14:45
SHANNON KELLOGG And, and I think that if you're able, yeah, to do it in the morning and at night that would be great and then, uhm, planning to do you know, five to ten minutes is all you need of really that deep breathing. And then like you said before a test or anytime you start to feel anxiety coming back you know, whether it's a-- you know, in your classroom, in the car, you can go ahead and do the breathing. Uhm, did you have any questions about it? Did it feel-- did you understand kind of what I was saying about the stomach going in and out? 

02:15:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. I definitely felt it. 

02:15:10
SHANNON KELLOGG Okay. 

02:15:10
UNKNOWN Uhm, I was wondering if I should do it, uhm, with-- in silence or with music in the background. I was wondering if like - 

02:15:20
SHANNON KELLOGG Ah. 

02:15:20
UNKNOWN - I thought like my friends might notice because I don't wanna look you know, like the weirdo who's just doing like this breathing. 

02:15:25
SHANNON KELLOGG The deep breathing. 

02:15:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:15:25
SHANNON KELLOGG Well, you know, when you're at home just doing it, it's up to you if you wanna have relaxing music in the background that's great. Uhm, and when you're out with your friends they won't really notice. So don't put your hand on your, uhm, stomach but other than that if you're doing the deep breathing they would really even be able to tell.

Microtraining Associates Presents 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents Shannon Kellogg Psy.D. and Lucy Vail, MFT Shannon Kellogg Psy.D 

02:16:50
SHANNON KELLOGG Welcome to 5 Approaches to Working with Adolescents. In this video we'll review five key components of working with teens. The first and most important stage of working with an adolescent is building rapport. So this means building a strong trusting relationship with the teen and having a good working alliance. Next, we'll review with an adolescent who's struggling with depression and adolescent who's having difficulties with anger management and adolescent who's having trouble with anxiety. Lastly, we'll demonstrate how I work with the teen in a school setting. Even if you're not working directly in a school setting, we'll demonstrate how to work effectively with parents and teachers. When people ask me why I enjoy working with adolescents and kids, my answer is honestly that I genuinely like them and that's one of the most important aspects of working with this population is really liking who you're working with. So you know, getting along well with teenagers, being able to connect with younger people that's essential and it's not for everybody and that's okay. But for people who enjoy it and who love doing it, teenagers will really respond to that because they can tell us if you like them and that is the first and most important step of any working relationship. My experience has include a wide variety of settings over the past ten years in working with teens and adolescents thus, it include my post doctoral works supervising, ah, family and youth parent partnership program, working in a school setting, ah, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings, ah, with kids, adolescents and families. I've also taught at the college and graduate school level teaching courses of psychology, helping skills and introduction to psychotherapy and marriage and family counseling. 

02:18:30
Lucy Vail MFT 

02:18:35
LUCY VAIL I have really enjoyed working with adolescents for over 20 years even before becoming an MFT, I worked with adolescents in prevention in programs in Boston, in the public housing projects. We had groups of adolescents that met right within their own public housing project and we are able to use alternative interventions like art therapy, hatha yoga, meditation, music and to build resiliencies and promote a healthier lifestyle. Then as an MFT, I've worked with teens in a school setting, in and outpatient mental health clinic and also in day treatment for, uhm, with teens that had such severe emotional struggles that they weren't able to function in a traditional school setting. I think this is one of the most difficult stages in life, it's the streaky transition going from childhood to adulthood. And I guess I have a certain real compassion for this difficult stage and I really enjoy working with adolescents and helping them make this transition successfully whatever that means for them into a healthy successful adulthood. My approach with adolescents is client centered and narrative. I think it's a critical first stage to spend time joining and building rapport with adolescents. And I do this by using unconditional positive regard, uhm, being nonjudgmental, being very present and genuinely curious with the adolescent and discovering-- being genuinely curious about their story and their unique perspective. 

02:20:25
Working with Adolescents in a School Setting 

02:20:30
LUCY VAIL In this section, we use a case example of Anthony to walk you through one students referral to counseling. In addition to showing how Anthony ends up with a therapy referral, we will demonstrate several difficult conversations that often occur on a school campus setting. One is with a teacher and another with Anthony's parent. Every school campuses like a village and it has its own specific unique culture. It's important as a counselor or therapist in school campus to get to know this culture just as we join with clients and build rapport with clients you'll need to build rapport and join with the school campus. This can be done easily through getting to know everyone from the principal to the landscaper, lunch lady, nurse, teachers and you'll get to know how to best navigate and communicate with people in this setting. As with any village, news travels fast so maintaining confidentiality is critical on a school campus. This can be particularly tricky where you're amongst other professional such as the principal, nurse, teachers who may not be accustomed to maintaining the same level of confidentiality that you're mandated to.

Counseling on a School Campus Integrated treatment Access to clients Groups 

02:21:50
LUCY VAIL There are great benefits to offering counseling on a school campus. First, integrated treatment with instant access to teacher, school psychologist and parents. You have easy access to clients. And the school setting presents an opportunity for consistent and regular sessions. Groups may be more easily formed on a school campus where regular consistent group attendants can result in deep peer interactions and support. In this section, we'll follow Anthony from his arrival at the school in the middle of the school year to his referral for counseling. Anthony enrolled in the school three months ago in the middle of the school year. He's been to several different schools in the past few years and as his family moves frequently. He lives with his mother and younger brother all are currently living with an uncle who has a wife and six children. Anthony's home environment is chaotic and has little adult supervision. Anthony may have witnessed domestic violence in the past between his mother and father as well as more recently with his mother and other boyfriends. This is how Anthony was referred to counseling. Anthony enrolls at school with little identification and without a parent. After just two weeks, Anthony sent to the principal's office several times for disruptions and aggression in the classroom. Anthony was involved in a school fight with another student who Anthony reports disrespected him. Teachers discover that at the previous school, Anthony had an IEP or Individual Education Plan under the classification of severe emotional disturbance. In a short time, Anthony has become known as the bad kid by administration, teachers and other students. Later in this series we work with Anthony on his anger and aggressive behaviors. However, in this section we will look at a difficult interaction with Anthony's teacher and with his mother. In both cases we present a less favorable example and an alternative example of communicating with a more strengths focus. In this demonstration, I have a conversation with Anthony's mother. I have made several attempts to contact his mother by phone with no result. Today, Anthony's mother has called and left a message for the therapist, ah, requesting a return call because she has received a call from the pins-- principal about this fight that Anthony had with another student on campus. This next conversation is with Anthony's teacher understandably this teacher is overwhelmed by the demands of teaching in an urban high school. He has little to know time to discuss individual students. And when the therapist does get a moment of his time, he basically unloads about his struggles with Anthony and his idea that Anthony is an unchangeable bad seed. Here are two demonstrations of interactions with a teacher in his classroom. In the first example, the therapist listens patiently while the teacher unloads about intense struggles of having Anthony in his classroom. The therapist decides to just agree in order to keep the peace with the teacher. In this second example, the therapist does a number of things differently which in turn shifts the teacher, his view of Anthony and in turn the teacher's approach with Anthony. The therapist listens and gently employs a strengths focus to highlight what is working with Anthony. Point out Anthony's efforts to improve his behavior and express how well Anthony responds to positive feedback and begin to get the teacher on board with classroom interventions that will support support Anthony in meeting his goal of better managing his aggression. The same and similar skills and approaches are used with this teacher as is used with a therapy client. As a therapist on a school campus, you're an advocate for your clients. In this example, the therapist isn't advocate for Anthony's preferred identity. As Anthony works to manage his overwhelming emotions and new ways, the therapist reinforces a strengths focus to the teacher which will affect the way the teacher interacts with Anthony which ultimately will set the stage to support Anthony to try his new strategies for manning his be-- managing his behavior in the classroom. 

02:26:50
The Approach and Introduction Advocating for the Recognition of Strengths and Resiliencies Collaborating on an Intervention 

02:26:50
LUCY VAIL This conversation takes place in three sections. First, the approach and introduction. In the preferred example, this step includes a full and proper introduction and a moment of joining with the teacher. Second, advocating for the recognition of strengths and resiliencies. Here, I model the recognition and focus on Anthony's strengths rather than focusing on his recent struggles. This opens the teacher to the possibility of a preferred identity for Anthony, an identity of bright and committed student in the face of adversity rather than aggressive, punk, cool will never change. After developing a connection with the teacher and fostering some hope for Anthony's transformation the teacher is more open to this other aspect of Anthony and he's more willing to participate in a classroom intervention. 

02:27:50
Example 1 

02:27:55
LUCY VAIL Excuse me, Mr. Martin, I wanted to talk to you about Anthony Ramirez, he's one of the kids in your class, I think? 

02:28:00
MR. MARTIN Who? 

02:28:00
LUCY VAIL Anthony Ramirez, he wear sunglasses and a hoody a lot. He's been really struggling with anger lately. 

02:28:05
MR. MARTIN And who are you? 

02:28:10
LUCY VAIL I'm sorry, I'm a counselor on campus. I've been seeing Anthony for counseling. 

02:28:10
MR. MARTIN Hmm, yeah, Anthony he's, ah, he's quite a troublemaker. I've sent him to the office numerous times, ah, he's always disrupting my class, fighting with other students. 

02:28:25
LUCY VAIL Okay. 

02:28:25
MR. MARTIN Ah, I want him out. 

02:28:25
LUCY VAIL Oh, I know, I'm sorry, you've been having so much trouble, he's really been struggling. 

02:28:30
MR. MARTIN What is it you wanted to talk to me or ask me about? 

02:28:30
LUCY VAIL Right, well, what I wanted to ask you was how he's doing in your class, what your impression of him is, ah, he was just referred to me for counseling. 

02:28:40
MR. MARTIN He's good kid, ah, but he's got a lot of trouble you know, he's disrupting the class, he's fighting with students, he wears a sunglasses in the class when I'm trying to teach. He's disruptive. I need him out. 

02:28:50
LUCY VAIL Right. I understand, well, you know, I'm hoping that if I can see him every week in a regular basis then it might make some kind of difference that's what I'm hoping. 

02:29:00
MR. MARTIN Well, you can hope all you wanted but I don't think there's any hope for this kid. 

02:29:05
Example 2 Part 1: The Approach and Introduction 

02:29:10
LUCY VAIL Hi, Mr. Martin. I'm Lucy Vail, I'm one of the counselors on campus. I've been meeting with kids that struggle with the variety of different things and I was wondering if I could talk to you about Anthony Ramirez. 

02:29:20
MR. MARTIN Yes, sure, I've seen you but I didn't what you did. 

02:29:25
LUCY VAIL Right, uhm, aren't you the coach of the baseball team? I hear you have an undefeated season. 

02:29:30
MR. MARTIN Yeah, I am. You watch baseball? 

02:29:30
LUCY VAIL Yes, congratulations! I haven't been to a game yet but it's all my list of things to do. I definitely want to do that. Uhm, I was wondering if you had just a minute to talk to-- talk about Anthony. 

02:29:40
MR. MARTIN Yeah, I have a minute, ah, you know, he's a real pain in the butt. 

02:29:45
LUCY VAIL Right, I know. 

02:29:45
MR. MARTIN I might take him out in my class. 

02:29:45
LUCY VAIL I know. 

02:29:50
Part 2: Advocating for the Recognition of Strengths and Resiliencies 

02:29:55
LUCY VAIL Thank you so much for talking, ah, but I'll just take a minute of your time, I know you teachers have a million things going on. Uhm, I've been meeting with Anthony for about a month now and one thing I've got to say for Anthony is he's been on time every single week. 

02:30:05
MR. MARTIN Hmm, I'm surprised. 

02:30:05
LUCY VAIL Right, I know. Actually, he has agreed to meet with me and he shown up every week. He's really struggling and behind closed doors he really wants to get this aggression under control. I think that it's very hard for him to admit it in front of class or in front of teachers. 

02:30:25
MR. MARTIN Okay, well, a couple of weeks ago, ah, he started causing up a storm, we got all frustrated. He tore the test, threw it at me, ah, he's disruptive in class and I want him out of here. 

02:30:35
LUCY VAIL Right. 

02:30:35
MR. MARTIN He's, he's a real troublemaker. 

02:30:35
LUCY VAIL Right, I know, he told me about that incident. He's-- I, I can imagine that that's not easy for you when you've got 30 other kids in your classroom to worry about. So, uhm, he's really been trying to get his aggression under control you know, Anthony has had a pretty tough life. He's seen a lot of aggression at home. And that kind of behavior is really hard to change when she been doing it for a while. Sometimes I get a sense from Anthony that that's the only way he knows how to deal with his aggression or actually any other emotion. 

02:31:05
MR. MARTIN What is it he's gonna do about it? 

02:31:05
LUCY VAIL Right, well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. We have a couple of ideas and I was wondering if I could run them by you. 

02:31:10
MR. MARTIN I definitely have a minute, I'd love to listen to it. 

02:31:15
LUCY VAIL Okay, great, I appreciate that. 

02:31:15
Part 3: Collaborating on an Intervention 

02:31:20
LUCY VAIL What I've been working on with Anthony is, uhm, recognizing that moment just that second when he's about to blow and he's really getting upset. And in that moment, uhm, talking to him about making better behavior choices. One of the things we've been playing around with is if in your classroom and he recognizes that he's starting to get really upset, if he can just step outside for a minute like a minute to three minutes, just stand outside the classroom door. 

02:31:50
MR. MARTIN Uh-hmm. 

02:31:50
LUCY VAIL I really feel that if he can catch his breath, remove himself from the situation he's gonna be able to make better behavior choices. This is something that I've had a lot of success with, with other kids by kinda removing themselves from the situation and in that moment they're able to make a better behavior choices. 

02:32:05
MR. MARTIN Uh-hmm. Yeah, you know, as long as he's not taking advantage of it and just, ah, doing not to get out of class, I think it be great. 

02:32:15
LUCY VAIL Right, right. Well, that would definitely have to be part of our, our agreement that if he's, if he's using it just to get out of class we'll have to do something different but I really appreciate if you could just you know, support him the first couple of times, this wouldn't be forever, it's just for a month or two to give it a try. 

02:32:30
MR. MARTIN Yeah, I definitely be open to the idea of helping this kid, ah, make some changes. 

02:32:35
LUCY VAIL I've got to say, one thing I've really noticed about Anthony is he responds really well to positive feedback like when I started to see him and I was telling him, thank you so much for being on time then he's really trying to be on time next time. And, uhm, my sense is if you could support him just a couple of times with this, he's gonna like the positive that he gets from you. 

02:32:55
MR. MARTIN Uh-hmm. 

02:33:00
LUCY VAIL If he can make better choices, he's gonna develop more positive relationships with teachers, administration, he'll stay out of trouble for a little while and my senses with a kid like Anthony, he's gonna really enjoy that and wanna do better and better over time. So I'm wondering if, uhm, next week in the IEP meeting, is that something that you could support us with if I bring that up as an idea? 

02:33:20
MR. MARTIN Yes, that's something I would definitely support as an idea. 

02:33:25
LUCY VAIL Okay, great, well, I appreciate it, thank you. 

02:33:25
MR. MARTIN You're welcome. 

02:33:30
In this next demonstration, the therapist speaks to Anthony's Mother on the phone. The second example includes a moment of joining, establishing roles as ally and support, advocating for recognition of strengths and resiliencies, encouraging parent involvement in counseling and collaborating on an intervention. 

02:33:50
LUCY VAIL Hi, Ms. Ramirez, this Lucy, I'm Anthony's counselor at school. I'm returning your call. 

02:33:55
MS. RAMIREZ Ah, yes, hi, uhm, I just wanted to talk to you because the principal he just called and he said Anthony got in a fight or something with another kid and honestly, I don't know what to do. I have had it with this kid. I, I, I've offered-- I threatened to ground him for two years. I've, I've tried everything that is in the book and I just cannot make him behave. I don't know what to do. Can I put him in foster care or something cuz seriously he's hank-- he's uncle offered to take the belt to him. I'm at (inaudible ) end, I'm seriously willing to try to do anything. I don't know what to do. 

02:34:30
LUCY VAIL Right, right. I understand. I'm so sorry, I know you've been struggling with him for a really long time. You know, I'm hoping that if I meet with him on a regular basis that it might, uhm, that it might be able to help. 

02:34:45
MS. RAMIREZ No offense but you know, honestly I don't think that will work. I-- we've met with other counselors and nothing seem to help. 

02:34:50
LUCY VAIL Right, right. Well, I understand. I'm gonna go down to the principal's office right now and see what's going on. Uhm, are you going to be coming in to school? 

02:35:00
MS. RAMIREZ Uhm, no, I can't come in right now but I will be able to pick him up after school. 

02:35:05
LUCY VAIL Okay. I'm wondering if you might wanna come in and meet with me some time? 

02:35:15
MS. RAMIREZ You know, I just-- I really can't come in right now. 

02:35:15
LUCY VAIL Okay, all right, well, Ms. Ramirez thank you so much for calling. Please feel free to call me anytime. 

02:35:25
MS. RAMIREZ All right, bye. 

02:35:30
Example 2 Part 1: Introduction and Establishing Role as Ally and Support 

02:35:45
LUCY VAIL Hello, hi, is this Ms. Ramirez? It's Lucy Vail, Anthony's counselor at school. 

02:35:50
MS. RAMIREZ Ah, yes. 

02:35:50
LUCY VAIL Well, it's great to finally talk to you. I'm so glad that you called. I know that Anthony is really been having struggles lately. 

02:35:55
MS. RAMIREZ Okay. 

02:36:00
LUCY VAIL And you know, I just wanted to say that I think that he's a really good kid. We've been working together for about three months now and from everything he's told me I can tell that you're such a warm and supportive mother. 

02:36:10
MS. RAMIREZ Well, thank you. 

02:36:10
Advocating for Recognition of Strengths and Resiliencies 

02:36:15
LUCY VAIL I know that Anthony has had some kind of incident today and I wanted to first start by telling you that in the time that I've been seeing him, he is always been on time. He's always really respectful and I really think he's a great kid, he was just going through a tough time. 

02:36:35
MS. RAMIREZ Oh, well, thank you and honestly I'm kind of surprised that he's been on time. I mean, I'm glad he is but I really just don't know what to do with that boy. I mean his principal called me today and he said that he had gotten in a fight. 

02:36:50
LUCY VAIL Right, right, right. I know, I was just down at the principal's office talking to them and I have to say, Anthony seems really upset with his behavior today. And I just wanted to let you know that it seems like the principal is really impressed with the fact that Anthony's been coming to counseling consistently over the last couple of months. You know, although most of what Anthony and I-- Anthony and I talk about is confidential between us, I just wanted to let you know that I really feel like he genuinely wants to better manage his anger. Him showing off for counseling tells me that he's ready to change and willing to kinda give some things a try. I think it's just really hard for him to admit it in front of other people. 

02:37:35
MS. RAMIREZ Well, I'm glad to hear it because honestly, I don't see it at home. I mean, he barely talks to me and when he does talk to me, all he does is swear or is really disrespectful. 

02:37:45
Encouraging Parent Involvement 

02:37:50
LUCY VAIL Right, right, I understand, I'm sorry. I know you've been having a really hard time with him. You know, I would really love to meet with you here, uhm, and that eventually meet with you and Anthony. Uhm, I could even come to your house if that's better for you? I really encourage you to come in. There's no charge and I feel like if all three of us could meet together, you'd have a little extra support. 

02:38:10
MS. RAMIREZ I really do care and, and, and I really do wanna help him. I just-- I feel so bad that it's gotten this far and, and I just-- I feel like such a bad parent and - 

02:38:25
LUCY VAIL Right. 

02:38:25
MS. RAMIREZ - I just don't know what to do to help him. 

02:38:25
LUCY VAIL Right. Well, I understand. I mean you've had a really hard time with him and sometimes you just need a little extra support, a little-- a new perspective. I'd really love to offer you my support. 

02:38:40
MS. RAMIREZ Okay. I guess I can come in. Uhm, can we meet next week on my day off? 

02:38:45
Collaborating on an Intervention 

02:38:50
LUCY VAIL Sure, whatever works for you. Would you mind if I made one little suggestion, uhm, between now and then? 

02:38:55
MS. RAMIREZ Okay. 

02:39:00
LUCY VAIL Okay, well, here's the idea. Anthony has been working really hard to make better choices when he gets angry. One thing that we've talked about is he feels like if he could just step away or catch his breath for one minute when he's really getting upset that in that moment he might be able to make better choices. So I'm wondering if you could support him in that like let's say, if around the house he's getting really upset. Would it be possible to just kind of gently remind him, does he wanna take space or just step aside, step outside, catch his breath for a moment? Because in that moment I think he's really gonna be able to make some better choices. 

02:39:45
MS. RAMIREZ Well, I can try it but I really don't know if I'll do it. 

02:39:50
LUCY VAIL Right, right. I understand that's all you can do is give it a try. So I'd be interested to see between now and then when you come in next week if you were able to give it a try. 

02:40:00
MS. RAMIREZ Well, I'll tell you if I do. I'll, I'll see you next week. 

02:40:05
LUCY VAIL Okay, see you next week. 

02:40:05
MS. RAMIREZ Bye.
