DR. MARIE MIVILLE And now, it is my pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker, Dr. Kevin Nadal. So I can say I, the Dr Kevin Nadal is someone that I knew him when. When he was a beginning student in the field, full of verve and fire which he still is as you will see in just a moment. He's an amazing performer, actor, comedian. Indeed he was one of People magazine's hottest bachelors in 2006. He is already a TV personality in his own right. My favorite stories that he once won an argument with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News Channel on the O'Reilly Factor and I think, were you a student at that time? Yeah, he was a student at that time, so when I say verve and fire, I mean, verve and fire. He's wonderful. And now he's got his own Web TV show among many others and those of you who are in the, in the class, I shared the, the web link for that. So uh… it's, it's really wonderful to see uh… Dr. Nadal just blossom and just really set, uh… begin to set the next generation's tone for scholarship. As a matter of fact, umm… were you part of the Filipino, Filipino-American conference. He helped organize a couple weeks ago and so again we see our, even further diversifying of what we call multicultural counseling in psychology. More seriously doctoring Nadal is an associate professor at the City University of New York, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and The Graduate Center. He's also the Executive Director of CLAGS, The Center for LGBTQ Studies and the President of the Asian American Psychological Association. He is a national trustee of the Filipino American National Historical Society and a co-founder of the LGBTQ Scholars of Color Network. He is one of the leading researchers in understanding micro aggressions or subtle forms of discrimination that negatively impact historically marginalized groups and now, the incomparable Dr Nadal.

KEVIN L. NADAL How is everyone doing? Good, it's Friday, it's 9 o'clock in the morning. I'm so happy you all are here. I hope you all got your coffee. Umm… and I hope you all really take this weekend to uh… just really enjoy what we have to offer here. I am a teacher at college Alumni uh… Alum I should say. I, I have uh… I was part of the counseling psychology program as Dr. Miville had mentioned. Umm… I was mentored by Derald Wing Sue, is he here? Did he not come to this? Yeah, he'll come later, all right. Umm… and I, I remember when I first applied to Teachers College. Umm… and one of the reasons why I apply it was because of the winter roundtable. It was because I saw that if there was an institution that was really committed and focused on multicultural social justice issues and psychology then that was the program that I needed to be in. Umm… and so fortunately, I was able to be admitted and, and to really have a training in which multiculturalism and social justice is not an afterthought. It's at the forefront of everything that we studied. And I'm being a part of this program umm… I was able to think critically about issues related to social justice um… within the realm of psychology in a way that many people uh… don't have the opportunity to. And so I first want to uh… pay tribute to teachers college for giving me that outstanding education. Umm… today, I'm going to talk about umm… the media and social media and the power of finding your voice. Umm… as Dr. Miville has mentioned, I had been really fortunate and lucky in a lot of ways to have gotten all the different opportunities that I have. Umm… and I really uh… recognize that many people might not have those privileges and those opportunities. And at the same time, I also realize that I got a lot of those opportunities because I somehow learned how to manage this system that we live in this system of racism and heterosexism and sexism and every other ism you can think of. Umm… knowing that uh… the system tells you that you don't have a voice, the system tells you in many ways that things aren't fair or just and that while that is true that we need to do everything possible to make sure that our voices are heard. So today I'm going to talk about giving psychology away. Giving psychology away means that we can no longer talk about issues related to psychology and education and social justice within the confines of the Ivory Towers that we need to be able to relate and translate the things that we learn in our classrooms to every single person in our life. That we need to have the same types of conversations that we have with our professors and with our colleagues with our grandmothers and our nieces and nephews and to anyone that is important to you. That thinking about social justice shouldn't just be something that is in a box that stays in one place that it has to be distributed in all aspects of our lives. And if we really want change to happen in our world that we need to do everything we can. Every single person has that responsibility to do everything you can to ensure that Social justice is a reality in our world. So give psychology away, don't just keep it to yourself or distribute it with other psychologists or uh… psychology students umm… but offer it to others. And today we're going to talk about how to do that. So uh… when I think about uh… the media, first most uh… as I pull this up, raise your hand, if you have a Facebook account? Awesome! Raise your hand, if you have a Twitter account? Raise your hand, if you have an Instagram account? Gosh! You all are well connected. Uh… raise your hand, if you have a Pinterest account? Oh, my goodness! Raise your hand, if you have a Grinder? No, I'm just joking. Probably someone is going to raise their hand anyway. Umm… but look around you. Great, so look around or as you looked around you saw that uh… people have these tools. Umm… when I was a, a doctoral student which was only eight years ago, uh… we didn't even talk about social media because it was new, it was something that we didn't know would blow up in the way that it did. When I had clients, uh… we barely had Facebook and Linked In. And so once in a while, we would have to talk about ethics and boundaries and clients who Facebook requests you and how do you manage that. Umm… but it, it wasn't uh… something that was already in the books, umm… it wasn't something that was already written into APA or ACA ethics. It was rather just an afterthought, because it was so new. Umm… the world has changed so much in even just eight years, I think about how the last presidential election was different than the previous presidential election. And how social media and uh… just the ability to speak your mind and have millions of people uh… hear what you have to say, how that could change the entire a trajectory of our country? If President Obama uh… was not as accessible on, on social media uh… regarding when he was running for president and if you weren't talking about him or reading about him. Perhaps, he would never have become President of the United States. There's so much power, I mean, having access to the world and like Dr. Miville said, um… that that comes with other responsibilities and other consequences. Umm… but what I want to focus on is how you can use uh… that power to uh… make that change. So, I want to say thank you to a lot of people in my life. Um… especially to my uh… graduate students, my research team, my mentor Derald Sue, umm… who will watch this later or no, he, he probably won't, umm… to my colleagues, my friends who have really been there for me and my academic families. Umm… I think one of the most important things for anyone success is to have a collective, uh… to be supportive with others, to be able to umm… to embrace each other and enhance each other. And so this is uh… one, one thing that I want to do is think all these folks. So today we're going to talk about a few things. One is I'll share a little bit about my personal journey. I think one thing that we don't do enough in psychology is share our narratives. Umm… we often come to a classroom setting umm… and especially come to a therapy setting as a clinician and we talk intellectually. We ask our clients to share their emotions and their uh… experiences umm… but we're taught that self disclosure is bad. And well, that can be understandable in a lot of ways umm… we also miss out on the opportunity uh… to get to know each other. So learn from each other, to understand where other people are coming from. To know that every single person's identity and experiences influence the very ways that they interact with others and so I'm going to share my, my story and then I want to talk about the power of, of media. And when we talk about media, I've been mentioning social media. Umm… but how can you use social media even as a way to even influence mainstream media? Uh… and then finally we'll come up with various ways umm… that you might be able to use uh… social media as well as other forms of media in your everyday life. So let's start with me. This is me as a fabulous little kid. Umm… when I came out to my parents in my '20s, uh… they said, "Oh, my gosh! I have no idea you are a gay." And I said, "Really Mom, look at my childhood pictures." Like, seriously like, who does that like, I cared who wanted to be uh… a fashion model, that's what it was. As a kid umm… I think I lived uh… pretty ordinary life in a lot of ways. Uh… I was a child of the '80s. I uh… was born in the United States, uh… I like things that American kids typically liked. Umm… I wanted to be a Solid Gold dancer, I… learned every lyric to Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson songs. I uh… tried to blend in and fit in to have an experience that uh… was either neutral or positive in my life that I wanted to uh… make my parents proud. And at the same time, I wanted to fit in. And so having the multiple identities that I have uh… in my life and I have whole held on to my life. Umm… as a child I probably didn't think much about them. Uh… but in retrospect, all of those identities uh… then influenced the very ways that I perceive the world and uh… the very ways that I made decisions on how to navigate that world. I was the youngest of three boys in a immigrant Filipino family. Uh… my family immigrated from the Philippines in the '19, in 1965, uh… which is right after the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which just celebrated its 50th anniversary a few months ago. I mean, and that Immigration and Naturalization Act allowed people from all over the world, but especially from Asia to immigrate to the United States without quotas. Prior to 1965, umm… for about 20 years, there are, was a quota on, how many people from each Asian Country could come to the United States? Umm… and at the time the quota was 50 people. So when a given year, 50 people from any Asian country could come to the United States. I would say there is like a 100 people here umm… in this room right now. Uh… so, two countries this is how all of you for the given year could come to the United States uh… during that time. Umm… my parents like most post 1965 immigrants came here in search of the American dream. My parents lived in very poor uh… rural communities in the Philippines. Where going back to where they came from, I saw poverty. I saw what you typically see in those Phylicia Rashad, Save the Children commercials where they uh… had no running water, umm… there were eight siblings in my mom's family that lived in the same room. Umm… where they never thought that there would be opportunities for them. But my grandparents on both sides, they heard of this land called United States and they knew that there was this dream that was at least possible, this American dream. So they made sure that all of my uh… aunts and uncles and my parents uh… got educated. Umm… my parents got college degrees from the Philippines or they moved to uh… the metropolitan area of Manila to get their college degrees. Umm… and around that time is when the Immigration Act was passed. And so they were able as these educated professionals to come to the US. When my parents came to the United States, they had next to nothing. My mom said, she had two suitcases filled with clothes umm… and they had very little money, because my grandparents didn't have any money to give them. Umm… my parents uh… found jobs in, uh… my mom as a nurse in the local hospital, my dad found the work wherever he could. And they worked as hard as they could to provide us with the things that they didn't have. Growing up that often meant hearing lots of things that uh… reminded you of the poverty they came from which I like to call Filipino guilt. Where umm… we, we realized that we needed to be thankful umm… for uh… all the sacrifices that my parents made and maybe as a kid who want to just fit in and who wanted to be just an American kid, I didn't realize uh… how much they really sacrificed. Imagine if uh… your, your living conditions today were such that you heard that there is this other magical place across the earth uh… where you could move and live. And that meant at, at the time giving up all contact with your family back home umm… perhaps, never seeing your family again. To take that risk for the opportunities not just for yourself uh… but the opportunities for your children and in my parents case the opportunities for their hypothetical children. Umm… think about what that sacrifice would have been like. And I, I, I remember umm… just hearing stories of all the, the, that that the racism and discrimination that my parents faced at that time. And so not only did they immigrate to the US, but they came here uh… with the promise of the American dream that we're faced instead with uh… bigotry, with uh… hostility umm… and, and lots of cases for across uh… every uh… emigrant that comes to United States umm… just the isolation umm… and difficulty in adjusting to American life. I was also the youngest of three boys which meant that we were taught very traditional gender roles. Umm… my brothers were very much into sports and they love uh… playing baseball and basketball and football. Uh… I hated sports um… I was smiling in this picture, but I'm really crying on the inside. And part of me wanted to uh… to tell my parents I didn't want to play sports. But, I knew that that's what was expected. I knew that this is what boys were supposed to do. I also knew that uh… being a boy meant you weren't supposed to express emotion, you weren't supposed to cry. Uh… and having the intersectionalities of being Filipino, being the child of immigrants, on being Catholic uh… meant that my gender roles were even more umm… dominant or umm… or, or that the messages were even more dominant. Uh… because uh… they were very specific expectations of what it meant to be a boy. So when I was struggling with my sexual identity, uh… perhaps I didn't uh… get the most support that I could have. And in retrospect I think about what my life would have been like if I was a kid who at six or seven years old was taught to embrace my identity. In some ways umm… I'm glad I didn't have that experience, because I think that very uh… all of the different uh… atrocities or hardships or difficulties and discrimination that I had to experience umm… is what uh… influenced my passion and my drive today. But, at the same time umm… it would have been nice to have been told that being gay is okay. It would have been nice uh… to have been told umm… that uh… who you are and what is natural for you uh… is acceptable, is celebrated umm… and is something that uh… that society uh… would embrace and, and appreciate as well. Umm… when I think about my high school days, umm… I, I think about a combination of things umm… I think about things like uh… being really active in leadership roles, umm… joining student government on being part of multicultural student organizations. I'm really very active look at my senior picture of my life, ultimate '90s. Uh… if you can see on the left, my left ear, I would like, I hoop earring like how '90s is that. Umm… but as a kid and during that time I, I navigated the world as best as I could without being prepared. I didn't have uh… any books or articles or magazines or movies that reflected my identities or experiences. Umm… and by identities I mean my ethnic identity as a Filipino-American, umm… as a kid growing up umm… as a Filipino American kid growing up and I imagine as other ethnic groups as well umm… that are under represented in the media. We watch TV and we get excited and uh… perhaps even start to count the number of Filipinos we could see even if they are the extra in the back up of Law and Order SVU episode, because that's all that we had at that time. And Filipinos today… despite the fact that uh… we are the second largest Asian-American uh… group in the United States as well as the second largest immigrant group in the United States, as well as uh… one of the largest uh… or the largest immigrant group in many states umm… that we still are invisible on television. Umm… we have uh… our multi-racial and umm… uh… have mixed Filipino heritage who oftentimes don't embrace that uh… who oftentimes don't share that out loud. Umm… so Bruno Mars, please start telling people you're Filipino because you are, How many people here are? All right, so tell everyone today, tweet that Bruno Mars, your Filipino please talk about it. Umm… and then we had some representation, but maybe wasn't the best. So, some Filipino representation during that time was uh… stereotyping Filipino women as, as being umm… submissive or, or sexually subservient umm… and even more recently having Filipinos like Manny Pacquiao who uh… have made uh… have become successful in a lot of ways and, and represent uh… being able to come out of poverty and become successful. Umm… however also having uh… other parts of my identity that he might uh… neglect or, or uh… say negative things about umm… which that makes him not a role model for me. So, I bring up all this to talk about media. This is my first web site in 1999 (inaudible ), '96 (inaudible ) so it lasted for a little while. Umm… there is a uh… a website called Wayback umm… and you could look up what a new website was uh… in any given period if it was on file. Umm… so one that's kind of cool. But, then too it's true that things will never go away. Umm… so if you ever like send uh… pictures to each other make sure that they are headshots. And that's about it. Umm… but this was my first introduction to, to my media, my… uh… at my undergraduate University of California, Irvine. Umm… we took a class in the 90s umm… that taught everyone how to make websites and I believe it was a requirement for social sciences. Umm… and so back then they were thinking about that like this is a skill set that you all should have. And so after that class was uh… completed I maintain the website that we were asked umm… to create, to… to create umm… and for a while, I was one of the few people during this time who was blogging regularly. Sharing my thoughts about what I felt about the world, umm… talking about umm… my personal life experiences, uh… talking about politics, talking about identity uh… which was odd for people. Umm… and I know that it, it brought up a lot of reactions umm… especially when I was a psychology graduate student. Because is what uh… Kevin is doing is it, is it ethical, is it, is it appropriate. Umm… and I understand in retrospect why those were the concerns, because it was so new. Umm… however, these days to, to be having online presence is normalized. Umm… but imagine what it was like uh… back then. Umm… I also have, have been in media in other ways. Umm… so this was uh… my husband, my now husband when I proposed to him, uh… some friends uploaded it on the Internet. I mean, it's been shared many times of how I proposed to him, so Google that later, yes, I want a friend is a beautiful story. So when I think about the media, it started off. It's just me having my personal's webs, web page. Umm… and then it led to uh… things like this. Having an opportunity to umm… not only be uh… to have a voice umm… but also to increase your, uh… your visibility, your exposure, which then gives you more place. So when we talk about media what is media anyway? Umm… well, thank you for asking, Oprah. Media is a couple of things. One, media is uh… the plural form of medium. And uh… according to Webster, it is the main means of mass communication especially television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet regarded collectively. Umm… media is plural for medium, which I didn't know. So then I said, "What, did they say media on this?" And medium is an agency, agency or a means of doing something. And as I thought about that I thought that was so beautiful, because not only as media what we know it is that it is uh… the ways that we can communicate uh… to the masses, umm… the various forms of communicating to the masses. Umm… but it's also the method of doing something that method of getting your messages across to people, the ways that you can influence the world. And so when I talk about media, today I want you to think about that that it's not just that that uh… the object of media which is the uh… various forms of media. But, it's also the ways that you have the power to communicate to the world. So when you think of media you might think of, of how media has communicated, so through news programs, through magazines, uh… through uh… televisions, through new websites and web blogs, umm… so we think about the types of media. We also think about who is in the media umm… and these are some folks that we might read about regularly. Umm… that to, uh… that that we have a culture of celebrity in our world where we're curious about umm… everything that people uh… do. Who are celebrities in our, in our lives or, or in their lives and we watch them. Umm… so not only has uh… social media increased, but things like reality TV shows have increased. Umm… which uh… some might view as uh…, you know, just a part of our cultural shift. Umm… but how I might also view as uh… the ways that we accept bad quality things as acceptable. Umm… that way do I really need to know what the cardassians (ph) are doing every single second, umm… or one because it's funny, but two, umm… maybe we need to invest in more quality programming as well. Umm… when we think about the media, we think about television, uh… we think about music, we think about film and the various ways uh… that those three forms of media might have true influence in the world. Umm… so when we think about umm… shows like, "Sex in the city," umm… we see how that may have uh… given a different perspective of how women and sex and gender roles uh… could be uh… conceptualized in our country, when we think about film we see the opportunities uh… for people of various diverse experiences umm… to tell their stories, uh… through, umm… various narratives, through documentaries, umm… through fiction, umm… and uh… to be able to, uh… to reach the masses with that form. Umm… we think about film we also see that there can be a lot of limitations that some uh… films don't depict the diversity umm… of experiences in the world. And so when we uh… think about that hash tag Oscar is so white, umm… we see that reality that the Oscars for the second year in the row uh… did not have any nominations uh… for the leading actor and actress categories of any people of colour. And so why is that, who defines, what's uh… considered culturally significant or salient, I mean who defines what's not? And then we have Beyonce. Now, no one say anything negative about Beyonce. But even if you're a critic of Beyonce, umm… to recognize her as using her medium to communicate with you all, umm… her ability to use her power and her fame, her popularity uh… to share her messages uh… what are important to her and to her identity, umm… in this case, umm… sharing messages that clearly reflect her thoughts about black lives matter, about police brutality, about her racial identity. Umm… to understand that uh… when someone has this power umm… it's their responsibility to use it in positive ways umm… and to know that when someone has this power and does, does you say in responsible ways that there is a potential for backlash. And so, media can be a way to educate others, but it also can be a way uh… for others to critique you. So media has been umm… lately, mainstream media has lately uh… been paying attention to diversity. Uh… in ways umm… that some feel are too late like why haven't they done these things before. Umm… but others view as well, at least they're finally doing something. Umm… when uh… we look at television uh… we often see uh… one of two things that communities of colour are portrayed in very stereotypical ways. Umm… oftentimes in the form of a side kick, that's not the main character of a show umm… or two with that they're not portrayed at all. So in uh… fresh off the boat than we have ABC comedy uh… this is the second Asian-American family to ever be portrayed umm… on a television show in 20 years. So for 20 years, Asian people did not see an entire family on a regularly uh… scheduled network show uh… that reflected their experience and even then, uh… Asian people of other ethnicities still don't have that experience. So South Asian people uh… Filipino, Southeast Asian people might not necessarily relate to fresh off the boat, because while it's a uh… general Asian-American or East Asian-American experience uh… that their ethnic experience may not be uh… recognized. Umm… and then we have Black-ish, the beautiful Black-ish, umm… where just two days ago umm… they uh… did an episode on police brutality in, on Black lives matter and uh… representing the various reactions that people might have to these movements. And I wanna shot out Black-ish just because I thought uh… they use their platform, their medium to… really educate and influence people that might not otherwise have listened. 

00:31:00
DRE Wake up. Let's say they listen to the cops and get in the car. Look what happened to Freddie Gray. 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, and what if they make it all the way to the station? 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN You remember Sandra Bland? 

00:31:05
DRE And let's say they do make it to trial. 

00:31:10
BOW Mm-hmm! 

00:31:10
DRE You see where that gets us. Don't you get it, Bow? The system is rigged against us. 

00:31:15
BOW Maybe it is, Dre. But I don't want to feel like my kids are living in a world that is so flawed that they can't have any hope. 

00:31:25
DRE Oh, so you want to talk about hope, Bow? Obama ran on hope. Remember when he got elected, and, and, and we felt like maybe, just maybe, we got out of that bad place and made it to a good place that that the whole country was really ready to turn the corner. You remember that amazing feeling we had during the inauguration? I was sitting right next to you. And we were so proud. And we saw him get out of that limo and walk alongside of it and wave to that crowd. Tell me, you weren't terrified when you saw that. Tell me, you weren't worried that someone was gonna snatch that hope away from us like they always do. That is the real world, Bow. And our children need to know that that's the world that they live in. Come on. Let's finish watching it. Let's see what they're gonna say next.

KEVIN L. NADAL So, I show the clip just to demonstrate that talking about uh… media in the mainstream is possible that writers have the opportunity to show this uh… type of content. And that it could be produced and it could be filmed and it could be distributed. Umm… that yes, there is a lot of uh… there are a lot of systemic obstacles that prevent these types of things from being shown all the time. But perhaps, it takes that courageous writer to make sure that this is something umm… that the television show represent. Uh… I, I also show this clip uh… because of the power of what the message is umm… that usually, when something happens in disenfranchised communities, it… there are things that we tend to read about within our own circles, within our own Facebook uh… pages and timelines uh… that we don't necessarily see it, report it in mainstream media. Umm… to hear names like, Freddie Gray and Sandra bland mentioned on mainstream media's powerful. It shows that it's not just our small circles or communities that care about these issues or that recognize that there is this systemic discrimination and racism uh… that is keeping people of color and other marginalized communities down. Umm… but that it's something that people are collectively recognizing and so I also show uh… this clip umm… to, to use as a teaching tool. So I am, if this was a smaller classroom we potentially could talk more about this two minute clip umm… in so many multifaceted ways, because of the power of what it's conveying and so to know that we can also use media as an educational tool. I also want to talk about media through academia and when we think of media we might think about those things that I mentioned before movies, TVs, News programming umm… but what about your voice as the Agent of media that writing books, umm… that describe your experiences, your research and particularly writing them in ways uh… that people can understand and relate to. Regardless of their discipline or their background or their identities umm… that's powerful. Umm… to, to be able to share uh… your work umm… in ways where you might not even realize the impact that you're having on others. But, knowing that uh… when someone finally approaches you, and tells you that that your work matters, umm… that it was worth it, to know that writing your dissertation in the library at 2 am in the morning and crying, because your dissertation advisor just sent you revisions and your defense is the next day. That that is worth it when that young kid comes umm… and, and greets you 5, 10 years later and says, uh… that your work inspired me that I actually read your dissertation uh… and that it changed my life. So think about the, the books that you were exposed to. What uh… how did those influence you, umm… and how are those much more accessible now than they may have been in the past. Umm… when I think about my uh… my previous uh… experiences with, with that media or prior to this age that we live in now. Umm… I was always in search of the perfect book that spoke to my experience. Umm… I was a closeted teenager who would go to the gay section of a book store which at the time would be one shelf in the back, umm… and I would look for something, anything that could help validate my experience. And then I would pick up the book, I would go to the uh… the register, I'd pick up some other side books to distract them, magazines umm… if anyone question me, I just had to pretend that I'm normal, I'm a straight guy, I'm buying this for someone else. Uh… but that's what we had to do, because it was so hard. It was physically inaccessible to have books at your disposal. Umm… think about uh… how those change your life? If you didn't have those books, umm… how did, what, what would your trajectory be in terms of how you think about things on what your identity is. And so that is also a powerful form of media. Umm… so social media we know in talking about we've shared umm… the overall gist of this that people are on social media that this is, this is your tool, this is one of your main agents for getting your message across and for advocating for social justice. Umm… there are currently over 1.2 billion users on, on Facebook and on Twitter uh… and that there are umm… one billion users on Instagram. My favorite stat from this insta, uh… instagraphic, whatever that's called it for info graphic is this one on the right corner. Uh… social media has replaced pornography as the most popular online activity. So social media is everywhere, everyone is using it. Umm… some sites find uh… that people use social media more than they use Google search tribes or, or Google searches. Umm… that people go to check their news from their friends and what their friends are posting on as opposed to going to places that uh… are there just to share news. So news sources are, are now being replaced by blogs umm… and by op-ed pieces. And so this is the power of social media. So, Jelo(ph), you ask how can I use social media to advocate for social justice? I'm so glad you asked, because there are lots of ways. One is that you need to know that you have a voice and that you can make a difference. So, Dr. Miville talked about umm… this incident that happened in 2007, where I, I was asked to be on, The O'Reilly Factor and I was on internship at the time. Uh… and I basically with, what had happened was, was that it was 2007, and uh… a friend had asked me if I had seen an episode of Desperate Housewives? Umm… I replied, I hadn't, she said, it's, it's, it's online so 2007, was enough where they were already streaming things it up and had lots of buffering umm… issues, but they were streamed. So I, I took the time to watch it and uh… on the show Teri Hatcher's character had made a joke umm… about uh… medical schools in the Philippines being umm… inferior or deficient in some way. So, it's one small joke about Filipino medical schools umm… but given that Filipinos are very rarely uh… recognized or visible in media and mainstream media. Umm… it felts even more of uh… of uh… ouch moment, of uh… an attack on Filipino Americans. Umm… and it felt even more so of, of an attack, because Filipino-Americans umm… really are overrepresented in the medical field. That uh… majority of nurses who immigrate to the United States are Filipino. Umm… that Filipinos, that Filipinos produces uh… is the third, third country that produces the highest number of medical doctors to the United States. So, not only are you uh… making a joke about a community in a stereotypical way, but now you're actually uh… saying something that may hurt uh… the perception of Filipinos in the media or in, in people's everyday lives. And so I, this was 2007, this is where Facebook was limited to college students, so I didn't have a Facebook page. Umm… and I basically wrote a uh… petition on a site called uh… petition.word. Umm… and I forwarded it to people and the petition basically said, "Dear ABC, we demand an apology. Please remove that joke from future episodes." Umm… and uh… I was on internship and I was supposed to be like, I don't know who are working. Umm… but I sent the petition now and what, what, what I noticed was that people reporting and importing and importing it to others. So this is before sharing on Twitter and re-tweeting and Facebook sharing. Umm… and in three days 30,000 people had signed this petition, in one week 100,000 people had signed this petition. Umm… so towards the end of that week, I, I get a call from Bill O'Reilly, umm… people and they asked me uh… to come on the show. Uh… the film in New York they said, would you like to come in the show, I said, "Oh, okay, I guess yeah, that's sounds fine." No big deal. Uh… I was telling a story earlier like, I had like the worst outfit in my entire life on that day. Uh… but I had no time to change, so I had to go buy a new outfit. Umm… and uh… and I went to O'Reilly, The O'Reilly Factor. Uh… when I got there uh… they were nice to me, despite popular belief that maybe Fox News might not be. Uh… I uh… got there sitting in the green room, they uh… they had hair make up or make up and… and they, we went on the show, on the show umm… you could watch it later umm… Mr. O'Reilly umm… tried to argue with me umm… and we talked about my micro aggressions and we talked about representation in the media uh… and he tried to call uh… me out on things. I, I think I did okay. I kept my cooling at the end of the conversation, Mr. O'Reilly says, "Okay, Professor, I see what you're saying." Uh… and essentially I won an argument with Bill O'Reilly. But, I share the story not only to talk about just the process of, of getting umm… on the show, but something that was really, really powerful for me happened in the waiting room, the green room. Umm… as I'm sitting there they have like their various parts of uh… the show they're very segments. And uh… there was uh… Miss America at the time umm… who had just won, she was in the waiting room or the green room with me. And so I'm sitting there, she has like, a whole crowd of people umm… that are there for her. Uh… I came by myself umm… Fox News had like a pot of coffee and like three cookies. So I took one and her whole crew share the other two. But, what was interesting was that one of her folks like, I don't know who it was a manager or so whoever it was umm… he started a conversation with me and he says, "So what are you doing here today?" And I said, "Oh, I'm here, because this thing happened on this TV show and we're just gonna talk about it." Umm… and he says, "Wait, what, so how, how many people signed the petition?" And at the time it was like 90,000 people had signed the petition, umm… so, you know, I'm just going to talk about that. Uh… and he's like, what organization are you from? And I said, "None, just me." And he looked at me and he said, "Well, I guess it's true what they say. One voice really can make a difference." And I took that with me and I thought, "Yes, you're right. One voice can make a difference." If I as an intern uh… on my finishing my doctoral degree can influence people in the matter of days to uh… hear what I had to say and for people to support me and people to umm… to agree with my message uh… and to then take action as well, then maybe I can do more. And so I, I thought about things like umm… how can I reach even more people. Well, one thing is that, you need to social media and especially Twitter and you need to use hash tags. Now there's going to be a workshop on what a hash tag is, so let that them talk about that umm… but Twitter is the means for people to communicate with the outside world. Umm… in, or 10 years ago people may have been taught that you need to write a press release. But, what journalist and other media folks will tell you now is that press releases are a waste of time, because nobody has the time or the attention span to read a one page press release. But, they do have the time to read 140 characters of what you have to say. So use Twitter, use hash tags umm… when you see that a hash tag is trending, get in on it, because that's an opportunity for you to add your voice to that conversation. Umm… when you add your voice to that conversation, people might share and re-tweet it which again will then increase your visibility which then influences uh… your ability to, to influence other. Umm… you're an expert, write about it. Umm… I, I've been writing for uh… The New York Times, uh… I've been, I've written for Buzz Feed, umm… I've written for or I have an article coming out next week in Huffing ton Post. Umm… don't doubt yourself that you're an expert regardless of what you think you have to offer, know that everyone has something to offer. I had a conversation with somebody yesterday umm… who said that, A young Filipino-American woman uh… and she says, umm… "Yeah, I don't really want to write, because I don't think I'm an activist enough." And I said, that's even more reason to write, because you will probably write about experiences that more people relate to this idea of knowing that there is injustice in the world, uh… but not knowing what to do with it. So, know that you're an expert and write about it. Umm… write op-eds or blogs umm… about your research, academics professors, researchers, graduate students, when you publish a study and it gets into that top tier journal, that's amazing, congratulations. But guess what? 10 people are reading it. And those 10 people are probably your graduate students who are downloading it and distributing it to others. Umm… so we need to look past that model of uh… pre-review journals only. Umm… what my colleagues and I have been trying to do is, every time you write an article that's uh… published in, in an academic journal umm… you need to tweet about it. You need to write another article that's written in a more accessible way. So that people who aren't psychologists, who aren't academics understand what you're talking about. So make sure that you know that it's not just about preaching to the choir, but it's all about making sure that you give your research away to all. And when you give your research away to all, it's more rewarding, because now you're not only hearing people talk about it in intellectualized ways, you're hearing people share how your research personally relates to their life. And that is something umm… that is so powerful, because now you have influence on their identity, how they feel about themselves, the, the internalized messages that they might develop. That being a queer gay Filipino kid umm… in, growing up in the United States, uh… I internalized a lot of negative things because I didn't have anyone to validate my experience. But if, if I did or if someone before me wrote about these things maybe, maybe I would have had a different experience. Umm… share, like, re-tweet comment, umm… social media is now of uh… tool up for operating in businesses that we have to uh… view it not just as a past time or as something that's just an interest umm… but rather that uh… approaching it we need to approach it in ways where we, we take the time now to like things to re-tweet things, umm… to strategize how you share things. To have campaigns, where you have teams of people who decide on what hash tag you're going to use, who decide, when are we gonna launch this? So you yourself launching one article is one thing, but if you have a team of people where each of them get 10 people to re-tweet it at the same time or around the same time. So that when you log on to Facebook, you see that 20 people are, are sending out articles of the same article. And but maybe that will reach more people. Facebook has a uh… an algorithm uh… for what gets read and what doesn't get read. Umm… if you see that your very good friend posted something and it didn't get a like, because of who knows what, because maybe no one saw it. Uh… do your friend a favour and like it. Because when you like it that increases the possibility that other people are going to see it. Umm… obviously still like things that you actually like. But umm… but know that if we all collaboratively work together and share and comment umm… that it then has more opportunities to pop in uh… to uh… your feeds and your timelines. Umm… so think about with Facebook how sometimes you see that people that you haven't thought about in years or liking your pictures. Well, they are liking your pictures because umm… other people are liking it which then now increases the possibility that they'll uh… see it on their own timelines. Umm… and so uh… know that that same thing can happen when you post an article of importance you post, a blog umm… you write a status even on social justice issues that it needs to uh… to be liked and shared umm… in order for it to be to reach them most massive amount of people. Umm… seek out opportunities, so earlier when I started I mentioned umm… that I made a lot of things happen. And I made a lot of things happen uh… one probably, because I just tend to be bold in a lot of ways. Umm… I don't know where this comes from or what identity this uh… touches upon uh… but somewhere in my life I said, like, let's just try it and see what happens and what's the worst that they could do? Umm… If I was in racial cultural lab at same time taking that like, what does that mean for me? I don't know, you tell me. But, but I have been known to just e-mail people who work for major publications. And say, "Hey, this is what I research, do you want to publish something on it?" And maybe one out of every five times umm… I get a response and four out of every five times I don't even hear back. But, if you even got that one out of five times now that's an opportunity uh… to share your work even further. Uh… so this is an article on, on Buzz Feed umm… that was titled 19 LGBT micro-aggressions that you hear on an every day basis. And this article umm… has now been viewed over a million times. Uh… and it uh… basically what I did was I asked my friends who identify as clear a chance umm… to hold up signs uh… that share some of the common micro-aggressions that they experience. And I did this because uh… month prior, a student at Fordham did an article where she asked people to hold up signs about racial micro aggressions that they experienced. Umm… and I said give her a hat tip and give her a shout out and said well, let's do that and let's also do this for LGBT people. Umm… and so as you can see uh… several people hold up signs umm… and just share these micro-aggressions, it, you can search for this as well. Lots of people commented on many positive and lots of negative. Umm… so with negative comments, I welcome those. I don't read them, but I welcome them. That's me umm… I don't read them for my own mental health like, I don't need somebody telling me about myself. Uh… I can have my friends to do that all the time. Uh… but I, I, I welcome it because it encourages the dialogue between umm… various people. Umm… in just as an example of what one LGBT micro-aggression, this is mine, "Where are your wife and kids? In my parents' imagination is the answer." Utilize your resources, so Dr. Miville have also mention that I have a web series that has been up for a couple of years. And actually umm… at 10 o'clock a new episode uh… what's uploaded, because I scheduled it in advance. So that's another thing you could do. Umm… but I created this web series uh… because I wanted more opportunities for people to talk about the very things that my social circles talk about umm… that might not necessarily be on the mainstream. Uh… and I say utilize your resources, because the reason why I was able to do this was because I discovered that John Jay College of Criminal Justice, umm… that they have a television studio and that it's free for faculty members to use said television studio whenever they, they want. Umm… I know that Teacher's College also has a television studio, I don't know if it's free, but it's there. Umm… and I'm sure that there can be uh… that there might be opportunities for people to use those studios as well. Umm… and so knowing that these things are at your disposal umm… means that you need to maybe do something about it. Don't, don't lose those resources umm… people would kill to have a free television studio. So if you have it why not use it? So, for the past couple of years umm… I have essentially had friends come on this web series and just talk to me about umm… certain topics. Today uh… on the uh… web series we're talking about social justice and activism, in the past we've talked about micro-aggressions, uh… we've talked about uh… things like identity and uh… intersectional identities. Umm… and so these are just real opportunities to share your work in a different way uh… while micro-aggressions at the term has increased throughout the years umm… it also isn't talked about in substantial ways, at least not on television. It's been written about but not talked about umm… on television. So sometimes, when something isn't out there we can complain and say, "Oh, why are they talking about micro-aggressions?" Or you could be the one to create it. I felt very similarly about growing up and umm… having psychology books that didn't talk about Filipino-American issues and I was upset like, "Why isn't anybody talking about Filipino-Americans?" And my mentor said, "Because you have to write it." So then I literally wrote the book of Filipino-American psychology, because if I didn't write it, I would just be waiting for someone else. So now you have the power to do that. Umm… thank you. Build your relationships and build genuine relationships. This is important. Umm… and I was really careful with how I wrote this and, and presented slide, because I didn't want to look like I was name dropping umm… which I sort of I'm, but I recognize that so maybe that's good. But it's knowing who your friends are that you genuinely like, who you genuinely like, who you genuinely want to get to know better or have gotten to know better and doing favors for each other. So, I have here uh… this is Ernabel Demillo, she was a Fox News Television reporter who I became friends with and then genuinely became friends with. And now, every time I needed a story uh… I would call her, "Hey can you do a story on this?" And she would do it, because we're friends and she cares about these issues. Umm… on the middle on the right, Janet Mock and (inaudible ). Umm… Janet still in a (inaudible ) but Jean and I have become very good friends. And so I asked her or Janet, "Hey can you re-tweet this, because I know you have so many people in your uh… in your circles umm… and so or you're following." And so then they'll do it and sometimes they won't, because they have so many other things that they're doing. Umm… but developing those genuine relationships. Why do they do that for me? Umm… because they know that we're friends like, I'm not using them I don't ask them to do these things all the time. Umm… I actually care about their lives we got to know each other above and beyond what people know them umm… on through, through the media with their perception or representation is. Umm… so develop those relationships in the same with uh… who is Jose Antonio Vargas, umm… who you all might know has uh… one of the leading voices in immigration reform, umm… and undocumented experiences, umm… knowing that we were friends before he became famous. Umm… and now uh… being able to maintain that friendship umm… well, also uplifting each other. So to know that you're not using them, because they also uh… utilize you, so I can tell them about what is going on in academia and in research. I could tell them like, "Oh, yeah, it sounds like what you're talking about is very similar to this study that you should know about. But let me translate it for you 'cause you don't have time to read that 30 page article." So build relationships but build genuine relationships. Don't use people. That's not cool. But, you use uh… utilize the resources that you have and get to know people. And then just as like uh… a side note, umm… people that are famous or on their way to being famous or all like they, they don't want you to gush over them, they want you to treat them like human beings. Umm… and so if you can do that in a way where you can still praise them, but do that in a way where they don't think that you're just uh… idolizing them or that you, you only view them as uh… what their uh… representation is umm… in the media uh… but that that feels more genuine for them. Umm… finally, uh… be humble while celebrating your exposure. Umm… humility is very important for me as an Asian-American uh… as a Filipino-American. Umm… and if I, if I took that humility and just kept it as my main way of operating, then none of my things would be shared and no one would really know what I'm doing. Umm… I think there is a way that you can balance it where you can share what you do umm… be genuine about it and hope umm… that others will see uh… that genuineness and, and share it and, and be proud of you as well. Umm… I know for me one way that I do that is to always humbly thank all the people that have gotten me to where I am, to never forget those people, to never forget those friends that knew you when umm… because those are the folks that supported you when you needed it most umm… and so to be humble umm… and to be genuine and to, to uplift each other. And that's the next piece is to uplift each other. So we're not uplifting the one on the left, we're uplifting Derald Wing Sue on the right, who was on CNN last year. Umm… when you see your friend doing amazing thing or in this pace here, the mentor, your academic father doing great things umm… to share it, to re-tweet it, to celebrate him, to celebrate anything that people are doing umm… that uplift others. Umm… to, uh… to avoid hating on each other which happens a lot. Umm… even if you critique someone, you could critique someone in a way, but you're not hating on them umm… but to, uh… to do whatever we can, because of so few of us are talking about these issues and we're fighting against each other, then the message gets lost. So to do it what we can to uplift each other. Umm… Start Media early, so this is a book umm… and I'm not promoting it for you to buy necessarily, because I don't get any broiled cheese umm… but it's a children's book called, "Ouch Moments" and it was published by APA Books and Imagination Books. Umm… and basically it talks about micro-aggressions that children might experience. Umm… I wrote the after word for it uh… but it's and it's a way for children to learn from a very early age that these are uh… discrimination or discriminatory experiences and providing parents an opportunity to talk to children about things. Know that there is no wrong time to talk to children, but rather that there is an age appropriate way to talk to children. So, when you talk to children about systemic racism you might not want to talk about the violence in a way that would scare them but maybe you could talk about the injustice and the unfairness umm… that that happens in the world. Umm… when talking to uh… a young kid about LGBTQ issues, you don't have to talk to the kid about sex or sexuality umm… or, or sex in, in that way the, the behavior of sex, but rather you'll talk about difference and identity and loving each other and umm… normalizing others' experiences so start those conversations early. And then finally umm… to repeat what I said earlier use media as an educational tool umm… so beyond this formation uh… amazing. The very next day I showed this in class and I posted it on Facebook and I said educators not, not uh… are you showing formation in class today. But I said, "How are you showing an integrating formation into your class today?" Because not only is it uh… something that is trending or, or was of very much at the forefront so that your youth, your students, particularly your younger students who might be interested in, in pop culture, hip-hop culture that they're, they're talking about it. So why are we going to continue to talk about things in ways that are pre dated or that might not be relatable to them? Talk about what's happening now. Umm… when you talk to and teach uh… about these issues umm… in ways uh… that they can relate to, they'll feel more connected to the material. And when they feel more connected to the material they're learning only uh… is, is uh… is, has more potential for uh… to uh… to happen and to occur umm… but that it's more long lasting. Umm… and that's what research has shows that emotional connections to learning can lead to more impact. Umm… and so uh… I end this uh… conversation with you all today umm… by really just reminding you that you have so much voice, you have so much power, you as one person really can make a difference. Umm… to know that you can use that power umm… and do multiple things to educate people, to uh… to change people's minds, to open people up to new perspectives or you could do nothing. You can assume that someone else is going to do it. We call this the fusion of responsibility, someone else will do it. But imagine, if every single person thought that someone else would do it and now no one is doing it at all. So I invite you all to take a, take a little slip. You can make a difference, know you can impact lives, you know, you can use these multiple tools to impact lives umm… and know that when you impact lives or you impact minds, you impact not just uh… how they think about the world umm… but how they feel about themselves. So thank you very much I appreciate it, have a great roundtable everyone. 

01:03:55
[sil.] 

01:04:00
UNKNOWN Thank you very much for a great importance on talk. 

01:04:00
KEVIN L. NADAL Hi, thank you Dr. Lewis. 

01:04:00
UNKNOWN Umm… so I had a question at, so as an early career personal and assistant professor, I guess I wanted to hear a little bit about the umm… you know, I think that academia has not coughten up umm… to… social media and the impact of using social media particularly with descending on research and umm… you know, you mentioned Twitter and all these things. So I just wonder umm… what are the… costs associated with using social media particularly for folks and those of us on the tenure track, if you have any words of advice or wisdom. I'm not on Twitter, because I worry about umm… you know, the, the backlash that other scholars have received particular woman of color scholars. 

01:04:40
KEVIN L. NADAL Mm-hmm! 

01:04:40
UNKNOWN Umm… with some of that social media backlash particularly when you speak out against racism and sexism, homophobia and things like that, so if any words of wisdom. 

01:04:50
KEVIN L. NADAL Sure, so thank you to Dr. Lewis who's speaking later in the conference as well. Umm… so I also, I, I mentioned at the beginning. I said, when I talk about the positives but there are definitely a cause there is definitely uh… the realities of what the world is umm… regarding the use of media. Umm… and I think you're absolutely right that academia may not have caught up uh… to umm… just that's new world and its new way of operating. Umm… and so I say a couple things, one is that to recognize that there are, there is the reality that your work or using social media can be used against you in some way. And we've seen multiple instances of uh… academics of color who are untenured umm… mostly uh… black uh… men and women, but I've been seeing a lot of black women who have been fired from their jobs for something that was controversial that either posted on social media or maybe set in a classroom, umm… and so when you're not tenured uh… those are real possibilities of, of what might happen. So I say that umm… and I also say to know what uh… your, uh… to, to know what you're capable of doing. If you work for an institution where they might uh… be open to using social media then to still be careful but uh… to, to be umm… more aware of uh…, you know, what some of those repercussions would be. And if you're working for a school that you know you will absolutely get in trouble for posting things on social media, then don't. Like, maybe you have to find other ways to get those messages across or maybe you need uh… to create uh… Alias Twitter accounts or you need like post through organizations or you need to ask your friends or your peers, "Hey can you post this umm… this is what, uh…, you know, this is something important to me. Can you post this?" Umm… and so I, I realize that that's the uh… reality of the world. And then at the same time for me I, I've always felt like that I don't want to work for an institution where I feel stifled umm… that if someone were to uh… to, to not allow me to have my voice, then I would question uh… working for that place. And then I also know that now in retrospect, I had the privilege of saying that because I was, I now have tenure. Umm… so I think it's tricky and I think you really have to make your, you know, make your decision based on all these multiple elements. Umm… and then the last thing I wanted to say was or take, you don't be on Twitter until you get tenure umm… that's what a lot of us have done. I mean I think I was doing stuff before Twitter, but I definitely, or before tenure umm… what is that for it and slipped, Twitter to, okay, but umm… I think I was doing stuff before tenure umm… but I'm definitely like I don't, I give zero F's about like what I post now because what are you going to do, fire me? Umm… so, so maybe that's another strategy to, to wait until you get tenure as well. So I recognize the difficulties in, in that and umm… we could talk about that more if you're interested. Is there a question in the back, or, oh, here, sorry. About here first and you're there and then we'll walk over after that. 

01:08:20
UNKNOWN Thank you for a very inspiring presentation, it was really if I twitted for Twitter or whatever you call it through the whole thing. So you'll come back to your account all filled up with stuff. Umm… I'm wondering along the same lines about the opportunities umm… when I was going up for fold one of the things that I needed to make a case for was impact. 

01:08:40
KEVIN L. NADAL Yeah. 

01:08:40
UNKNOWN Right and gosh, if you're not making impact, I don't know who is. What are ways in which you think those of us that want to go in this direction can document this impact or even provide some evidence based for tenure and promotion committees to understand the positive impact at the level at which you're making it that actually is consonant with the criteria for promotion? 

01:09:05
KEVIN L. NADAL Sure, thank you. So I think one thing that I didn't mention because I thought it would be going to technical but fits in perfect with this question is to umm… to have those stats readily available. If you have a page on Facebook umm… that is uh… a page and not your personal profile. They give you all the statistics of how many times your articles have been shared or viewed or liked. Umm… and then that shows literally shows the impact that you have. So the reason why I know I could say this thing was viewed million times or it's been shared a million times is, because I have those uh… statistics that they give you because of my uh… page that I use. So it might be helpful to have your own page just for that function in itself umm… because that can measure impact. Umm… there are also websites that show umm… how many times a page has that been shared or I'm sorry viewed at least umm… and so I don't know the names of those websites on the top of my head but that's another thing. So if you write an article, you could show how many umm… how many uh… views are tagged. Umm… if you have a video like uh… TED talk or any sort of umm… video uh… to screenshot, how many times this has been viewed? How many times umm… how many comments this has? Uh… so those are all uh… public domain through, through You Tube. Umm… so I think that's one way. Uh… I think and then I think also another thing is that umm… I would imagine that committees like uh… prestigious mainstream outlets. So umm… if you don't have the stats but they see that you've written for The New York Times or Huffing ton Post or given a TED talk or any number of things that are viewed as prestigious, I think that in itself could show umm… the, the impact of your work, umm… that uh… you presume that many people have read that uh… as a result of that. Umm… Google Scholar citations are probably important too umm… so prior to Google Scholar, people were just looking at impact factor and then sort of guessing umm… based on impact factor how many times your work has been read. Uh… but Google, Google Scholar will give you a score they'll tell you how many times your articles have been cited and then they'll tell you umm… uh… I don't think they'll tell you views, but they'll tell you how many times your articles have been cited and based on that they'll give you a score. Umm… when professors are linked into Google Scholar umm… you could see whose, uh… who scored highest in departments. And I think that's very important, because uh… when people view multiculturalism as umm… in, invalid uh… field of study or they view it as an afterthought or not as important as these more mainstream topics. Umm… so for example uh… I, one of the departments I'm in is the forensic psychology department at John Jay College. And so umm… when people think of forensic psychology they think of things like umm… uh… profiles of offenders umm… and sex offenders and umm… eye witnesses and things related to the court system. Umm… but they don't think about my work necessarily. And so my work even though I'm key noting, key noting at the Teacher's College Roundtable umm… this is probably not viewed in my department as a positive thing. When I was key note at American Psychological Association, no big deal, because it wasn't American psychology law and society which is the, the conference that would have been the paper deal to, to key note that. So I, I say that umm… because any opportunity I have umm… to show that my Google score is higher than everyone in the department, I show them that uh… because regardless if you don't agree with the quality of my work umm… or the content of my work uh… that I support that the quantity of my work surpasses you and everyone else in the department. Umm… and so I think that's part of the game that we, we have to play in a way that you try to be humble in doing that, but you also want to demonstrate your point. Umm… and then one other thing that I want to say umm… well, this is a secret so I'm just sharing it with you all and some of you all have left the room, all right, ready for the secret? Okay, so in academia when you're in a department and uh… you have an experience like mine where somebody doesn't value your work or they view your content of your work as not good enough umm… and find your ally. I hope everyone will have at least one ally, I hope that that ally will also have a, an, like, a marginalized identity that you can relate to in some way and that they're going through similar things. So what this is if you have that person umm… praise each other, we are department list serves. And I say this, because uh… if your department chair isn't praising you publicly no one else is going to. Umm… but if you have your colleagues say, hi, everyone just wanted to share that doctor Nadal, just published this just wanted to share the Dr. Mazzula, Silvia Mazzula is my person, umm… that she has done this. Now, everyone sees that and they reply, congratulations that's great, whatever. Umm… but if you don't uh… have your voice, umm… if you, if you don't have that opportunity to have your work displayed umm… then they won't know about it. And uh… second secret CC, the president and the provost umm… or the chancellor on that, so that they know what your work is. So my department might not necessarily know what my umm… the care about the contents of my work, but my college president does. And the reason why is because he knows how many Twitter followers I have umm… how many uh… views and articles I have umm… and that's what matters to, to him and to the, the, the college more than anything. Was there a question in back? Yes.

UNKNOWN Yeah, umm… I was like a person who's starting to feel I really like to uh… how much you put into this information and everything. I just kind of wanted to give a shot out to Millennials(ph). I, I don't think social media would be here as we see it now if not for the millennials(ph) it was interesting how kind of like mentioned here and there, but wasn't really mentioned outwardly. And I wanted to know what your thoughts are about the millennials(ph) and how umm… the media sometimes bashes them for like being so connected to with the inter webs, but also how that has driven this whole social media to be just as big as a movement as it is now. 

01:15:45
KEVIN L. NADAL Sure. Umm… yeah, I think the millennials have definitely uh… made an impact. And I think for me it uh… so didn't use the word Millennial but I talked about, you know, young people really changing the, the trajectory of the presidential election of 2008 umm… and, and even still this day, like having that impact umm… in uh… popularizing social media and so for it. Umm…, you know, I think that there are a lot of uh… there are, there are, there are definitely a lot of thoughts about the pros and cons of having access to social media. Umm… and so the pros being that people have access to their voice and people have the ability to uh… , you know, to share things at an instant umm… when they might not have had that before when they had to wait weeks or months to publish an article or to get a book or whatever it might be. Uh… so I, I think that the, the, the, the pace and the ability to reach people is a very positive thing. Umm… and then I think like that there, there also is a, uh… something to be said about just having uh… to say uh… to, to umm… (inaudible ) the phrases very carefully 'cause don't want to be misinterpreted. Umm… that maybe we, we don't have to be so hyper active in our responses to everything. So I think that's something that happens is that people are tweeting like non-stop like, every single thought that they have. Umm… and I, I understand that, but I also don't want to, to go into a world where people are now turning to, you know, their Twitter as opposed to having umm… real life conversations with people. Umm… and then there's this whole notion umm… about like whether millennials are uh… entitled or are they umm… you know, this is uh… or, or is there something wrong with millennials being uh… having all this access. And for me I, I don't think that's the case uh… for most. Umm… I think this is the world that millennials have lived in. If you think about a, an average 20 year old, so 20 years ago it was 1996, umm… that uh… that they, this is all they've ever known that the Internet has always been around for them that uh… and then even more so. Umm… If a 20 year old, uh… 10 years ago they were 10, 10 years ago was when Facebook and My Space and umm… Twitter started coming out and so Facebook and My Space have been in the, their young adult life for, for the duration of their young adult life. So I, I think I empathize with umm… with millennials who sometimes people view as uh… entitle, because I also view them as like well, this is just, this is just what the, their world is. And so I think it's oftentimes pathologized by older adults who might not understand, umm… and so I think that uh… we need to, to be able to just meet people where they're at and just understand where people's perspectives are. So I haven't quite thought about this yet umm… in terms of like how this translates while the work that I'm talking about. Oh, he didn't like my answer, he's leaving. Umm… I didn't say anything. But uh… yeah, so I think that that's just uh… you know, a new thing that were going to have to deal with. So five years ago we had to deal with social media even existing umm… and now we have to deal with all the nuances and intricacies of social media etiquette and generational differences and perceptions of what's acceptable or not.

DR. MARIE MIVILLE And I too, I want to give a shot out to the millennials because it's actually been the millennials in my life as nieces, nephews and students who actually brought me into the social media world. Umm… and they're friendly in, in warm way and, and it's actually my being inspired by my connection with millennial youth umm… that led to the choice of this umm… theme as, as my final conference.
