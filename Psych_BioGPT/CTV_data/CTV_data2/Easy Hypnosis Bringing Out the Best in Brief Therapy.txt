ROB MCNEILLY, MBBS 

00:00:40
ROB MCNEILLY Good morning. Umm… I'm Rob McNeilly, welcome and a lot of space needs here. Umm… Apparently they were going to be a lot more people but then uh… the person who's supposed to be here couldn't be here so I'm just standing here in his place so I hope that's okay. Umm… That Rob McNeilly couldn't be here so I'm… I'm here in his place. My name is Rob McNeilly and apparently I'm supposed to begin the… this experience by reading out the learning objectives so I'm going to do that. Number one, to identify the common everyday trench into experiencing hypnosis. Two, to create an experience of a preferred outcome. So there the… the formal uh… learning objectives. Actually, I want to deviate from that just a little and… Thanks. And my three uh… I want to speak to three issues. Uh… The first is when I first learned hypnosis longtime ago, 40 years ago I learned that hypnosis is very complicated, very difficult and actually very dangerous. So one of the topics I want to speak to is hypnosis can be simple, it can be easy and it can be ordinary. The second of the three issues that I want to speak to uh… is that whatever approach we're using, whatever technique, whatever theoretical orientation, one of the most crucial, one of the most beneficial, one of the most relevant contributions that we can make is to generate a good therapeutic relationship. You're coming into here, most of you don't know who I am and before you listen to even anything that I'm saying it will be something like who is he was (inaudible) trust him, is he… is he dangerous, is he talking rubbish or (inaudible). You know, there's some kind of process that goes on in any interaction where we're looking to check out the relationship and the having good therapeutic relationship is going to be cool to anything that any of us do whatever your orientation is. And the third uh… topic that I want to speak about is the notion of expectancy. Anytime any of us have a problem, uh… anytime any client comes to us with a problem, they don't come saying 'I've got this problem on another at any moment things are going to be okay.' Whenever we got a problem, ever, anyone, anything it always has a mood of resignation around it. I've got this, it's been like this, this is how it is and this is how it's going to be. So one of the major contributions that we can make is… is to somehow uh… influence the mood that anyone brings to us resignation, I'm stuck, I can't do it, to the mood of expectancy, mood of possibility, a mood of doesn't have to be like this, things can improve. So they're the three areas that I want to… to speak to. Now hypnosis can be easy, can be simple, can be ordinary. Now we can have… now we can actively generate a good therapeutic relationship and how to generate expectancy. They are the three topics that… that I want to spend some time with. And thank you for joining us. There're a lot of other places you could say and some of you might discover… Yes. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:05:20
ROB MCNEILLY You are? 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:05:20
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) Rob McNeilly is. I'm standing in for him. Yeah, (inaudible) to my alter ego. I've been trying to alter my ego for a long time, but unsuccessfully. My name is Robert McNeilly. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:05:35
ROB MCNEILLY Yes… yes… yes. I'm glad I created some confusion, so yeah, so now you can start to wonder back can you trust me because I'm not even saying who I am, you're not sure am I really me with the real Rob McNeilly, please stand up so… so we've got that uncertainty. 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:05:55
ROB MCNEILLY Well, I've… I've lost count… I've lost count. There're another three or four since I woke up this morning, so it keeps… keeps bringing. 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN I'm just wondering (inaudible) than you. (inaudible). 

00:06:10
ROB MCNEILLY Am I speaking too loudly? 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN You're loud enough. 

00:06:15
ROB MCNEILLY I'm not loud enough… Okay, I'll see if I can get this closer. Is that any better? No… well, I'll just talk louder. All right. So just some background uh… so that you can start to wonder whether you want… whether you're in the right, whether you want to stay and please feel free to… to leave at any… at any point I'll be mortally wounded and… permanently damaged, but I'll try and cope with it. Uh… I'm from Australia. My wife and I left Hobart, Tasmania A little while ago and 31 hours after leaving our front door we arrived here. And if you want to watch presentation before Gabriel (inaudible) you… you'll know that also she's medical background or medical background I was in a family practice in Melbourne, Australia for 10 years and became really personally uh… frustrated with my incompetence and ineptitude about dealing with anything human. I could deal with broken bones, (inaudible), deliver babies but anything to do with human interaction, human dilemmas I was like that was just blank nothing. Nothing in my medical training even touched on that. And as a result of a personal crisis, my first marriage was in trouble, I was in trouble. I was in crisis with that and I went to a traditionally trained psychiatrist in Melbourne, (inaudible) who I found enormously hopeful and turned out that he was… he was doing something that he called meditation. And turned out that he had written a book, a textbook on medical hypnosis so I discovered that, the huge help that I felt personally from my time with him was something to do with hypnosis, so I thought 'Well, I'm in general practice, I'm gonna find out what this is so I signed up for two-year hypnosis training program in Melbourne which was run by a very conservative hypnosis society and over two years as I (inaudible) hinted at before I learnt that hypnosis is complicated, you need to be very careful of it, it's dangerous, don't do… don't use hypnosis for depression, certainly not with psychosis and, you know, it's pretty scary stuff. So umm… but the benefit of… of being associated with that group was that I went to a conference in Adelaide in Australia and uh… there was a speaker there who at the time was umm… the president of the International Hypnosis Society and he spoke about spending time with an American therapist Milton Erickson, that was the first time I heard about this man and I was just trying to think of the name of this fellow. I can't remember, John Hartland… John Hartland. And he said he was sitting in (inaudible) sitting room (inaudible) and found himself coming out of hypnosis. Yeah, I felt this is interesting. He's the president of International Hypnosis Society. He's written a textbook on hypnosis and he found himself coming out of hypnosis. I didn't have gone into hypnosis somebody do their (inaudible) intriguing. And then I was privileged to see (inaudible) launch of his film in those days in Philadelphia 1976 The Artistry of Milton H. Erickson. Jeff mentioned the fact that the foundation is streaming this videos and if you haven't seen The Artistry of Milton H. Erickson and I recommend it really is an experience of artistry, you see, this man uh… starting new stuff .He's really… it's a beautiful example of how they Erickson that is best. So I saw this… I saw this film as it was then and it was love at first sight. I… I saw this man working with (inaudible) and then with Nick on… on his demonstrations and here was a person interacting with people, (inaudible) people, not patients, not clients, not defective, not he made some kind of drastic cure, but working with looking and hoping to find their… find their strengths and the abilities that they had. I was touch but as I say that was 76 so how long goes that? (inaudible) 40 years or so uh… and 40 years on I… I find that now Erickson has been dead now for 36 years, he's been dead for a long time. But what… what the legacy that he left, his left behind is not diminishing. Jeff had a show of hands, ask for show of hands this morning people under 30, people under 40 (inaudible) many hands went up so all of us are getting older, you know, we're getting natures, but there is this legacy that he's lift and the fact that… that there are many people here this conference as ours testimony to that. So I was inspired by… by those films and I thought this is something I want to learn about. so I got home to Melbourne and instead of writing to this man, I… I did a somewhat spur of the moment thing and I picked up the phone rang expecting to speak to some person, some secretary, you know, organize some time with a man and Erickson picked up the phone. I was staggered, you know, really shocked and he picked up the phone and I said, 'You know, I'm from Melbourne, I would like to learn with you' and he said 'Come on over.' So that's what I did. So I had the pleasure, and joy and privilege of spending a couple of weeks with him in 1977, another two in 98 and the final week with him in 1980 (inaudible) on the Friday… Oh! (inaudible) that suddenly became more audible. Uh-huh. We've got (inaudible). Oh, very good. Thank you. So it's better now, can you hear… nothing like a bit of technology. And yeah, I think a boardroom on Friday and he was… he died 10 days later. So I've been increasingly intrigued by what I learned from that man, with that man all those years ago and I've been uh… sharing that, teaching that in strange places around the world. My friend, Tiago, who invited me to Belo Horizonte in Brazil a few years ago. I did a fascinating workshop there in Brazil and I think there were 100 people in the workshop if I remember and my Portuguese stretches to uh… obrigado which means thank you, that's it. But most of the people in that workshop who spoke no English. I had a beautiful translator, Angela. She's like a little angel sitting on my shoulder. We had a very good time, it was a useful workshop. So I've been to other places teaching (inaudible) really go anywhere if people want to learn about this the end of next year, going back to Bristol and Czech Republic. But today, uh… let's… let's have play with what might be helpful. This is not a hypnosis conference, pre-therapy conference but of course the whole brief therapy movement began with Erickson, he… he was a source of a whole lot of things that meant. And although Erickson used hypnosis formally only in about one-third of his cases, there was something about the way that he was with hypnosis that informed everything that he did. There was a kind of an element of hypnosis in much of the therapy that he did whether it was formally hypnosis or not. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
ROB MCNEILLY So I see if I can get this really fast it's not working. Technology is wonderful when it works, right? So umm… let's… let's start with the idea that hypnosis doesn't have to be weird, doesn't have to be difficult, doesn't have to be complex. And one of the important contributions, one of the myriad contributions that Ericsson made was (inaudible) speaking about common everyday (inaudible) where someone can read a book, watch a movie, drive a car I get so involved in the experience that they become disconnected, disassociated. They get so much into the experience that everything else becomes background. And I think the start has an interesting contribution here in (inaudible) people talk about foreground and background. And whatever is in our foreground us what we're focusing on and everything else becomes background, but if I look past my fingers at the wall my hand becomes background and something else is foreground. So there's always that interplay between foreground and background according to what we're focusing on and how are we focusing on it. So if we think of common everyday trance is something just that where you read a book, you get into the book, you get into the experience of the book of the reading of it. And if the phone rings, if someone… someone knocks on the… on the front door there's some interruption, you put the book down, here's the phone and the door, and you come back to the book there's no big deal, it's just something that we do. So if we think of hypnosis as if we can begin to think of hypnosis as an extension of that then it gets rid of a lot of the weirdness, we don't have to think about… How do we… how do we… how deeply to some we're gonna get into trance, how do we measure whether someone's hypnotizable. How do we uh… What happens if… if something happens in the middle, you know, it's like uh… those games that you play as KG, put on a funny face and hope that the wind doesn't change because you're going to be stuck like that for the rest of your life. And people worry about what's going to happen if we come out of hypnosis. No, big deal. Nothing… No, more big deal than someone is reading a book or watching a movie and gets interrupted. So if… if you look at hypnosis and wonder what it is, if you try and find the definition of hypnosis, I wish you good luck. You know, the more textbooks that you read that what hypnosis is, the more confused to get. There is no consensus about what hypnosis is. And it always amuses me when… when people talk about brain scans and so on of hypnosis showing that its different from meditation uh… a crazy stuff because nobody knows what hypnosis is, so how can you measure it. But if we can give a description just as a why, as a practical way of beginning the description that when we say certain things that we're going to call hypnosis, what is that we're seeing that wouldn't call hypnosis. And just as while beginning the simple way offering the idea that when we see someone in having an experience with focus and absorption that we can agree is hypnosis then that is a working description in the same way that we can say that meditation is an experience with focus and absorption that we call meditation, that mindfulness is an experience with focus and absorption that we call mindfulness that (inaudible) an experience with focus and absorption, we call EMDR then by looking at that description, we don't have to get into this the head-butting arguments about hypnosis is the same as meditation or EMDR is not hypnosis, all of that kind of nonsense that's spoken about, we can just work on the description so I hope that's agreeable. I'm not… I'm not defining anything here, just giving a description. Hopefully as a place to start with is that… is that acceptable, I hope so. In other words I don't know what to do, we've to do something different. So if we think of hypnosis then just as a description, it's been experience, focus and absorption, then if you… if you notice you can look at the slide and it's very easy as you look at that slide to start to focus on it and maybe even get absorbed in it. So if you start to look for focus to absorb experiences in everyday life there's… there are round us. That's not to say that everything is hypnosis. But if you look for focused, absorbed, experiences, there are plenty of them. You… You'll see it all throughout this conference, you'll see if you look around at lunchtime, if you look around at anytime you'll see focus on children, nothing peculiar, nothing strange, nothing weird, just ordinary. And like I say we don't need to worry about whether someone's hypnotizable, we don't need to worry about how deeply someone is. Umm… I don't know whether, you know, or come across the work of Herbert Spiegel, he was a professor of psychiatry in Columbia University and here's an experiment so he wanted to have some standard way of inviting people into hypnosis and a way of measuring this ability. So Spiegel invented his hypnotic induction profile and this is a process that takes about 20 minutes to administer and… and as a result of this you got to score from zero up to four. And if you got a score of four, you're suitable for hypnosis. If you got a score of zero, you're not suitable for hypnosis, don't even bother. When Erikson chuckle when he said that he loved to see uh… some people who'd learned from him, work with Herbert Spiegel, people who had a score of zero and are unhypnotizable and help them to go into a transfer easily because he wasn't Erickson and this approach is not one that uses a standardized something to measure, but simply helping someone to get focused and get absorbed so that we can have an experience that we call hypnosis that doesn't then need to be measured. 

00:23:10
[sil.] 

00:23:15
ROB MCNEILLY So some of you into last presentation before where we looked at… we looked at the experience of helping someone to get in to the experience of something that they like, so one easy way of inviting someone into hypnosis is just simply asked him what you like to do and for most of us well perhaps all of us, if we… if there's something we like to do which very easy for us to get into the experience of it. It's not something that's going to be difficult or going to resist, going to be a pleasure. So we can ask someone what do you like to do and then we can invite this person to uh… recall this, get into this experience, notice what it's like and start to focus on some aspect of it, invite a person to get absorbed in that to some degree and then if we look, we will see changes… physiological changes that happen not with hypnosis, we'll see physiological changes that happen with any person who becomes focused and absorbed, and the kinds of things that we'll see changing someone's blinking, they usually start, you know, the blinking usually becomes a little slower. Uh… there's changes in the breathing, usually the breathing is just a little slower and a little deeper. Often there's some decreased physical movement, not in children and children get focused and absorbed "They move around, they scream around and (inaudible) with adults." We've learned how to behave properly and when we start to get focused and absorb we're usually relatively still. Some people can also notice changes in the pulse in the neck, Ericson was very astute observer, he could notice a change in the pulse in the neck. I've never been very… very good at that but some people… some people are. So we can comment on these changes and they just the… those comments serve to umm… inherit to… to validate that something is happening and also to enhance that. So that's umm… one way that we can uh… start to have an easy invitation into hypnosis. Now I mentioned that the second and third thing I want to speak about is the therapeutic relationship and expectancy. When we ask someone what do you like to do? Generally, the mood lift, generally that's a sense of connection. We're not telling someone, we're not treating someone, we're not asking difficult questions about anything, we're actually just having a conversation like two human beings, so that in itself just asking you about what you like to do is a very umm… very natural way of helping to allow a connection to happen and I've noticed that with hypnosis that sometimes, you know, we do some hypnosis with someone and they come out of hypnosis and (inaudible) I'm cured, sometimes with a hypnotic session at the end of the hypnosis, there's a change in the relationship and sometimes after hypnotic session, someone there's been ready to say things, do things, speak about things, interact with things that were not easy before the hypnosis. So actual hypnosis experience can help in itself, can help to… to create the therapeutic relationship. Those of you who know (inaudible) work uh… might know that he… he says that hypnosis is not a form of therapy, it's a way of delivering therapy. Uh… I'm a fan of Michaels, I admire him, I'm a friend of… a friend of him for a long time and I think he's absolutely wrong about that. One of the things about Michael is that you can disagree with him and he'll smile, you know, you don't have to have a fight with him. He's big enough to be… to be able to hold his agreement. I find that… that there's something about the hypnotic experience in and of itself which can be therapeutic, it can be healing, it can be connecting just my experience. But anyhow let's umm… let's see what we can do with this. Uh… Can someone come up and have a conversation this is not going to be therapeutic. Uh… Well, not intentionally therapeutic just to have this conversation what do you like? I will ask what do you like about it and then I'll say "Can we do this, can we go there and then invite focus, invite absorption." I'm going to comment about uh… what I can say and then the only other thing I'm going to do is to ask the person whose kind enough, crazy enough to be willing to have this conversation. What's happening, what do you notice about this, happen you make use of it. This is not intentionally therapeutic, please. Hi! What's your name? (inaudible) 

00:29:15
PATRICK Patrick. 

00:29:15
ROB MCNEILLY Very good. Please, Patrick, have a seat. Now you got a microphone here if you. And I didn't know whether you need to turn that on (inaudible).

00:29:50
ROB MCNEILLY I think you should come up here. No, it's not working. We need… we need a technical person. No, we don't have such a thing. Well, I think I'll just have to let us assume that you… let's just assume it's not working and I'll repeat your answers. 

00:30:10
PATRICK Okay. 

00:30:10

00:30:10
ROB MCNEILLY No, let's get it. Yeah, we can have too much technology. So Patrick, thank you for being willing to play here. And I want to be very clear that I'm wanting to demonstrate something primarily to show how this might look and then check really to be useful for you. I'm not primarily going to be trying to be useful. 

00:30:30

UNKNOWN Hello! Sorry… 

00:32:30
ROB MCNEILLY So do you notice there's… there's something missing here… 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Check… check… check… check. Check… check… check… check. 

00:32:40
ROB MCNEILLY I think you need to sit up here because… 

00:32:45
PATRICK Yes. 

00:32:45
ROB MCNEILLY No. Do we have another microphone? 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN I will check out. 

00:32:50
ROB MCNEILLY Please. So Patrick, says he like watching Celtic, it's a football. And I know that in Scotland it be called Keltic. 

00:33:00
PATRICK No. 

00:33:00
ROB MCNEILLY Celtic. 

00:33:00
PATRICK Celtic. 

00:33:00
ROB MCNEILLY Celtic. Okay. So what did you like about watching Celtic? 

00:33:05
PATRICK Because they're the best football team in… in Scotland and they usually always win. 

00:33:15
ROB MCNEILLY They're the best team in Scotland and they always win… they usually always win. 

00:33:20
PATRICK Yes. 

00:33:20
ROB MCNEILLY Usually always win. So you like there's something about the football, something about them being the best and something about the best in Scotland. 

00:33:25
PATRICK Yes. 

00:33:30
ROB MCNEILLY And something about the fact that they win. 

00:33:30
PATRICK Yes. 

00:33:35
ROB MCNEILLY All right. And you watch this on television. 

00:33:35
PATRICK On the computer. 

00:33:35
ROB MCNEILLY You watch it on the computer. Okay, so would it be okay if we were to watch Celtic now will that be okay. 

00:33:45
PATRICK Absolutely. 

00:33:45
ROB MCNEILLY Absolutely. Patrick is not resistant to that, he loves watching this so an invitation who's going to accept that pretty easily. So if you can recall sometime recently Patrick where you're watching Celtic on your computer that's it and then as you recall that, as you remember that, as you let yourself there might be some particular match that you're watching. Might be some you might find yourself starting with one match and then going to another it really doesn't matter. But just allow yourself to be in the experience of watching this football match, that's it. And then as you're doing this to allow yourself to begin to focus on some part of this, it might be a particular player, it might be the time, it might be the score, it might be I don't know what it is and it really doesn't matter that you can just allow yourself to focus in whatever way that you happen to be that's good and then as a natural consequence to allow yourself to become more absorbed in your experience, that's good. And as you're doing this and I thought everybody else to notice, please pay attention to Patrick, not me. As you're doing this without you making any effort, Patrick, there is a change in your blinking probably other people won't see this but I can say that you're blinking less than you were. (inaudible) even be a tendency for you to let your eyes close, I don't know and it really doesn't matter, if you close your eyes that's it or if you would have left them open that doesn't matter. And you've let your arms drop and your breathe in showing that subtle change that just a little slow, just a little deeper that's nice. And there's a relative stillness in your body, probably… people probably can't see, but that badge on (inaudible) is still on your lapel. And while this is happening Patrick, you don't need to listen to me because experience belongs to you and I wonder if as you are in this experience you can notice something about it and perhaps you could tell us without disturbing it. What is it that you are aware of? 

00:36:50
PATRICK My feet of tingly. 

00:36:55
ROB MCNEILLY Patrick says his feet are tingling. Is that okay? 

00:37:00
PATRICK Yep. 

00:37:00
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. He says that okay. What else do you notice? 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:15
PATRICK I'm… I'm not sure about body ends. 

00:37:15
ROB MCNEILLY Do you hear that. He's not sure where his body ends. Is that okay? 

00:37:20
PATRICK Now it's fine. 

00:37:25
ROB MCNEILLY That's fine. Isn't it interesting that someone can have a tingling feeling in their feet and he doesn't even know where his body aims and that's okay. In another situation some people would say that was psychotic, but in this situation we're going to call it hypnosis, not a problem. And when you notice that you don't know where your body ends and that's okay, what you experience with that? 

00:38:05
PATRICK There's a calmness, there's a stillness. 

00:38:10
ROB MCNEILLY Do you hear him? There's a calmness and there's a stillness. 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:35
ROB MCNEILLY So… This is not the first time you felt calm, not the first time you felt still, but if you could allow yourself to take a moment to get to know this feeling, you're feeling of calmness and stillness, and get to know a little more thoroughly than you already do, will that be okay? Because there maybe sometime in the future that I don't need to know about, maybe sometime in the future that you don't need to know about when it could be useful for you to feel calm, to feel the stillness. So my invitation Patrick is for you to stick with this experience it belongs to you, it's your calmness, it's your stillness. You brought this experience into this room with you. It wasn't a function of anything that I recommended, because you brought it here because it's a function of you, you can take it anyway and use it. (inaudible) you take that breath anytime. So could you sit with this photon to sucking it up and when you are satisfied that you have familiarized yourself with this to your satisfaction. When you've done that to your satisfaction, then you'll know what to do. Uh-huh. So Patrick what's different now than when we started? 

00:40:55
PATRICK Umm… I know where my body ends. 

00:40:55
ROB MCNEILLY You do. 

00:41:00
PATRICK My feet still tingle a bit. 

00:41:00
ROB MCNEILLY Right. 

00:41:00
PATRICK Uh… But I'm fine with that. 

00:41:00
ROB MCNEILLY You're fine, yeah. 

00:41:05
PATRICK And it was… was interesting. 

00:41:10
ROB MCNEILLY Interesting? 

00:41:10
PATRICK Interesting… 

00:41:15
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, do you think it has the potential to be useful? 

00:41:20
PATRICK I (inaudible). 

00:41:20
ROB MCNEILLY Well, that's good. 

00:41:20
PATRICK I know it has the potential. 

00:41:25
ROB MCNEILLY Well, good. I think interest is always the possibility but usefulness is… 

00:41:30
PATRICK Oh, yes. 

00:41:30
ROB MCNEILLY Okay. Do you have any questions for me? Or any other comments that you'd like to make? 

00:41:40
PATRICK I think you've respectful tone of voice. 

00:41:45
ROB MCNEILLY Patrick says he thinks that… Respectful tone of voice. 

00:41:50
PATRICK It was very soothing. 

00:41:55
ROB MCNEILLY Soothing. 

00:41:55
PATRICK A bit like conductor of an orchestra. 

00:41:55
ROB MCNEILLY Mm-hmm. 

00:42:00
PATRICK Just like a cadence and a rhythm. 

00:42:00
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

00:42:00
PATRICK And… 

00:42:05
ROB MCNEILLY Like a conductor of an orchestra, like a cadence and a rhythm. Okay, and umm… I wanting to see if I can kind of nudge this conversation. How… how do you feel about us now compared with when you came to sit on the chair? 

00:42:25
PATRICK I never met you before. 

00:42:30
ROB MCNEILLY Never met me before. 

00:42:35
PATRICK Umm… But I fell a… a kingship. 

00:42:35
ROB MCNEILLY He feels a kinship. We scoped stick together. 

00:42:40
PATRICK umm… I'm a medical doctor as well. 

00:42:45
ROB MCNEILLY Mm-hmm. He's a medical doctor, did you hear that. He's medical doctor as well. 

00:42:50
PATRICK (inaudible) disenchanted with general practice. 

00:42:50
ROB MCNEILLY He was disenchanted with general practice. 

00:42:55
PATRICK And since 1996 I've run a medical hypnosis practice in Wellington. 

00:43:05
ROB MCNEILLY Oh! Do you know Andrew (inaudible)? 

00:43:05
PATRICK Yes. 

00:43:05
ROB MCNEILLY Uh-huh. Okay. So since 1996 Patrick has run umm… training in medical hypnosis in Wellington in New Zealand… So I'm… I'm hoping to… to nudge the what you're saying to give evidence for my proposal that just having that experience you can trust me more there's… there's more like you said a kinship what I'm saying is a therapeutic relationship has been enhanced because of that conversation? 

00:43:45
PATRICK Yes, I… I felt very comfortable. 

00:43:50
ROB MCNEILLY Felt comfortable. 

00:43:50
PATRICK I felt very safe. 

00:43:50
ROB MCNEILLY Felt safe. 

00:43:55
PATRICK I knew that I was the one could you see all that. 

00:44:00
ROB MCNEILLY Patrick knew that he was the one that we're producing all that… 

00:44:00
PATRICK But it was good to have a guidance. 

00:44:05
ROB MCNEILLY Good to have some guidance. 

00:44:10
PATRICK To intensify the experience. 

00:44:10
ROB MCNEILLY To intensify the experience. Okay, so I was the guy… I was guiding like… like you said a conductor of the orchestra. You're making the music, not me. 

00:44:20
PATRICK Yes. 

00:44:20
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. And also I'm trying to get some evidence for expectancy. Do is there anything different now that you're saying that… that could be useful for your future? 

00:44:35
PATRICK Yes… 

00:44:35
ROB MCNEILLY Yes. 

00:44:40
[sil.] 

00:44:45
PATRICK It explains why and the end take session that I have with people often they'll say "Oh, what's that hypnosis?" 

00:44:50
ROB MCNEILLY He explains why the (inaudible) session we have with people they often say "Oh, was that hypnosis?" 

00:45:00
PATRICK Because I talk in a soft cadence. 

00:45:05
ROB MCNEILLY Because he… he talks in a soft, cadence and rhythm. Yeah, okay. So we have a shared background in a lot of ways. Mm-hmm. And also I… I'm claiming that not only a shared background but out of this conversation there's the possibility for shared future that I'm claiming that as a result of the short informal conversation, Patrick is more likely to be open to uh… having serious conversations about some serious problem that might happen in the future, not that's going to happen, but my… I'm proposing that… that because of the kind of interaction we're having that makes that more likely. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:05
PATRICK I would only want to be conducted. 

00:46:05
ROB MCNEILLY He'd only want to be conducted, okay. 

00:46:10
PATRICK By world-class conductor. 

00:46:10
ROB MCNEILLY By world-class conductor. Yeah, we gotta watch out for (inaudible) session actually going to come up from the South and I've got the wrong accent (inaudible). 

00:46:20
PATRICK And you have shown yourself to be a world-class conductor. 

00:46:25
ROB MCNEILLY I have? 

00:46:25
PATRICK Yeah, you have. 

00:46:25
ROB MCNEILLY How did I do that? 

00:46:30
PATRICK One thing he said was that you've been trained by Milton Erickson. 

00:46:35
ROB MCNEILLY Uh… 

00:46:35
PATRICK The other thing you said was that you didn't believe the hypnosis was scary and difficult and so on. 

00:46:45
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

00:46:45
PATRICK And you're… 

00:46:45
ROB MCNEILLY I've been trained by Milton Erickson, who was a good (inaudible) and also I wasn't scared of hypnosis. 

00:46:55
PATRICK Yeah and fits very comfortably with my own views. 

00:47:00
ROB MCNEILLY It's with Patrick's own view. Yeah, so we have that in common too. 

00:47:05
PATRICK Yes. 

00:47:05
ROB MCNEILLY Okay. 

00:47:10
PATRICK It's almost like a (inaudible) I known you before given your geographical proximity. 

00:47:15
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, I agree. 

00:47:15
PATRICK Yeah. 

00:47:15
ROB MCNEILLY Well, I keep do asking Andrew to invite me over there. That I'm just to (inaudible) my wife says (inaudible) and maybe we can do something here. But so would it be okay if people ask some questions because they want to know. Do you have any questions of… My question is how can we get a microphone that works, but see if it's working first. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN Hello! So I guess I'm curious about I understand how you did the focusing. 

00:47:50
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Would you be able to uh… explain to me the absorption. How did you do the absorption? 

00:48:00
ROB MCNEILLY Oh! I did was… I was asked Patrick to become as absorbed as he would like to just an invitation. And I found that usually when we'll get a chance to practice in a minute so you will find it out from your own personal experience. Usually umm… when someone starts to focus on something it's natural as if there's a corollary of that, that absorption happens, just happens. Is that… is that a good answer. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Yes… 

00:48:30
ROB MCNEILLY And please don't be totally satisfied, but have the question and then see what happens when you apply what do you notice. Thanks for the question. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN I wasn't here while you comment on absorption. I wanted to (inaudible) was to deep in it? 

00:48:45
ROB MCNEILLY Uh… Yes, I think that is… the… that language does two things. It… it… it can describe something and it can evoke. And I think that by inviting someone and then commenting there is the invitation and an evoking and then also a description so that it validates it. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN I was wondering what if you know nothing. 

00:49:10
ROB MCNEILLY Thank you. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Hi! 

00:49:15
ROB MCNEILLY Say… say again. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN What if you don't know anything about what interested in… (inaudible) 

00:49:25
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible). 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN She knows anything about football what if you don't know the right questions to ask (inaudible) experience. 

00:49:35
ROB MCNEILLY Oh, I think that… that's an advantage. Uh… because if I don't know something about something I can say, you know, I don't know anything about football, you can probably tell that from the questions that I'm asking. So it's an opportunity for us to take the one down position. So then the client becomes the expert. The client always comes feeling defective. There's something wrong with him and with important people we… we… we the wise people that I'll actually… So this is going to… You're the expert in football and I'm not so that change is the… the power differential in a good way. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Okay, in a follow-up… Break the absorption because now the person's really not getting focused and into absorption what they're doing is basically explaining football to you. 

00:50:35
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) Well, there's a balance in that. I wouldn't want to say… I wouldn't want to spend 20 minutes asking him to explain the different positions of… in football. But just to say whatever the experience is can you find something to focus on in whatever way feels right for you can you get absorbed in it then off you go. And the less we know the more how can I say vague or inclusive we need to be in… a in a language. If I say in football… in football it's very important that you… you notice hey, you're holding the ball and I think in that… that kind of football untouched with your hands so the… the more specific uh… the more trouble we will get into, so keep it vague. As long as we don't pretend I don't think it's a problem. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Okay, I'll do it. I've a very loud voice so what I wanted to ask you is about your voice like… 

00:51:35
ROB MCNEILLY My voice. 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN Did you have to practice a proper cadence and the level because I notice that you're not… You don't have that obvious umm… kind of (inaudible) very casual but invite them. 

00:52:00
ROB MCNEILLY Okay, I think the voice is an interesting topic and I'm not sure how important it is. Uh… I mentioned Herbert Spiegel, he was… he was a very… very effective hypnotherapist and when he was doing the hypnosis he felt like he was calling a horse race. When he was inviting somebody into hypnosis, he would say "I want you to (inaudible)" he talk like that. He did a very good work. It's not the technique, it's the relationship. It's not the technique, it's, you know, Herbert Spiegel was professor of psychiatry. 

00:52:45
[sil.] 

00:52:50
ROB MCNEILLY He… the relationship that sounds really… 

00:52:55
PATRICK You said something (inaudible) about David Spiegel and the… 

00:53:00
ROB MCNEILLY Herbert Spiegel. 

00:53:00
PATRICK His son David. 

00:53:00
ROB MCNEILLY David, yes. 

00:53:05
PATRICK Yeah, I met David last year in Glasgow. 

00:53:05
ROB MCNEILLY Oh, yes. 

00:53:05
PATRICK And I stood up here and he did the hypnotic induction (inaudible). 

00:53:10
ROB MCNEILLY Yes. 

00:53:10
PATRICK He said that I was a (inaudible) I was moderately hypnotized… 

00:53:15
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, moderately. 

00:53:15
PATRICK Okay, what he doesn't know is that I… I have did the creative imagination skill, score 30 out of 40 and an award winning actor and a standup comedian and I just thought the hypnotic induction profile was about crap. 

00:53:30
ROB MCNEILLY No, it's not a crap. It just measures your ability to do a hypnotic induction profile that all… 

00:53:35
PATRICK That was he said imagine at one point floating down through the chair… 

00:53:40
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

00:53:40
PATRICK And you can't float down and… and I… I can't float down, I'm a scientist, you float up… 

00:53:45
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, but he's a scientist, Patrick, you should… you should know where your body finishes. Now come on get real. 

00:53:50
PATRICK (inaudible) you know, and not very hypnotize… 

00:53:55
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah… yeah, so this is what happens when we get involved with technique, we have an argument. But Herbert Spiegel did great work. David Spiegel, a beautiful human being, he does wonderful work, but you didn't like it. You didn't like the profile. 

00:54:10
PATRICK No. 

00:54:10
ROB MCNEILLY No. And that is… that is one of the dilemmas that we have when we've the technique. And one of the things that we can avoid simply by following (inaudible) following Erikson's invitations to… to let to measure the… Instead of measuring someone to invite someone to do what they're good at. You get… you get (inaudible) of that. 

00:54:30
PATRICK Yeah. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN I don't this works… Okay… 

00:54:35
ROB MCNEILLY Speak quickly while it still working. 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN Umm… What if I work with juvenile school are very fond of the various drugs, so usually they don't like to do much in their lives, but let's say… 

00:54:45
ROB MCNEILLY Well, I'd like to take drugs. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN But they love weed in Southern California. 

00:54:50
ROB MCNEILLY Right. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN So… 

00:54:50
ROB MCNEILLY They would go. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN Would you consider, I mean, I find them actually very responsive because it seems like they're primed in some way, but would you allow… would you allow them to go into that… Image. 

00:55:05
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, my second son when he was 18, he told me he was smoking too much of that stuff and he said "Could hypnosis help?" I said "I don't know." Let's just see what happens. And we sat down and I said to him when you… when you've got a good joint and you've got really good stuff uh… what's the first thing that happens? Well, how do you know when it's starting to and he went like this. 

00:55:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:55:30
ROB MCNEILLY He got stunned in front of me and his eyes turned red. He got stunned. By remembering it, so that's… 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN And I've seen that but how do you then use to some sort of… 

00:55:40
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) We can move on and then we can get to how to use it. You're asking too many questions. Now that's a beautiful question and the short answer that if we think if someone who's… who's smoking too much marijuana, it's a problem and they're getting something from it. So if we find out what they're getting from it and help them to have the experience then they can get it without the marijuana or with it, so then we're increasing the options that the short answer, but we kept to that later. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN So my question is on the difference between technique and relationship. Because I agree the relationship is important, but isn't learning how to create a relationship a technique? 

00:56:25
ROB MCNEILLY Maybe. And I think that it happened there as a natural consequence of Patrick feeling that he was playing his music that I wasn't (inaudible). So whether you say that's the technique I don't know what it is. It's an approach for me but… 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN That was good. 

00:56:45
ROB MCNEILLY Okay, I'm looking to argue, but I would… I would not put the emphasis on the technique but more on the… the experience that's just my bias. Okay! 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, one more question. 

00:57:00
ROB MCNEILLY One more question lets it make so it's the last one so that we can… 

00:57:05
ROB MCNEILLY I think (inaudible). 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN Oh! Good it worked. Okay, so I work with children and a lot of times it's children with trauma background, but I find also these, you know, the teens especially well, they found their way of coping, you know, building up their walls and, you know, being strong and stuff. So would this be useful I'm… I'm just thinking here to you have several sessions as I begin to have them do what you kinda did and, you know, maybe what they did that week… 

00:57:45
ROB MCNEILLY No, I didn't think so. I think that children I found much easier, they… they haven't learnt to be sensible like as adults and they get into an imagined experiences and into remembered experience much easier than we do. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN Well, maybe more with teens as what I'm thinking. So would it be good then to do this for a while so that… To be comfortable with this, you know, going into hypnosis experience so that work with the trauma. 

00:58:15
ROB MCNEILLY Umm… I just give you a very… very short clinical example of this. Uh… A nine-year-old girl was having nightmares because she'd seen Jaws, she's seen the horror movie. She was waking up having umm… having nightmares of sharks getting it. So I asked her what she liked to do and she said "She'd been reading Harry Potter." So I say can we play a game (inaudible). So I said I want you to imagine that you Harry Potter's cousin… sister. So you're a wizard, you're not a Mughal just imagine that you're using you want to create a spell so that you'll be safe against the sharks and she got this big green on the face and I said "What are you doing?" She said "I've just surround myself with white light" and I said "what's that going to do?" That'll protect me. Are you sure. Better… better tried out she bought the sharks in she said "They're getting frustrated because they can't (inaudible) through the lot, now they're getting bored, now they're going away" and that was it. We had a conversation that lasted for about five minutes. She'd been getting into her parents bed every night for months, after that five minute conversation just like that, no, problem. So I'm not saying that it's always easy, I'm not saying that it always happens that quickly, but I've notice with… with kids that occasionally they… they get into something and move on much more quickly than… than as adults. And the invitation is (inaudible) don't take my word for it, see what happens when you play with it. Okay, Patrick. 

00:59:50
PATRICK Thank you. 

00:59:50
ROB MCNEILLY Thank you so much. 

00:59:55
[sil.] 

01:00:05
ROB MCNEILLY So now umm… that lady on from what we're doing and… and paying attention to that… that last question about how are we going to use this. Instead of asking as we do… do in a medical situation what's wrong here that needs fixing. If we ask what's missing fear that if you had access to it, you'd be okay. Umm… Something about exploring what's missing that makes it more likely that we're going to find it. So when you were talking before about working with children in trauma umm… instead of trying to… to trick the trauma which is going to be very complex and, you know, you're going to have to go to a lot of workshops to find and how to do that. If we find that with each child what's missing for them is it a feeling of safety… Is being able to sleep, is he being able to go to school, it's going to be different for different kids and if we find out what's missing for them, then… then we're… we're going to be more uh… more likely to… to be able to focus on specifically what's going to be helpful for this kid, this child rather than treating trauma. Training trauma such a huge topic, but helping this person to find what they are wanting so that that would be okay. It can be very focused, very effective, very time effective situation. 

01:01:45
[sil.] 

01:01:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:01:50
ROB MCNEILLY So… Sorry. 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:01:55
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible). 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:02:00
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) on the… on the website by the way. And now I'm… I'm disoriented with time what time did we start and what time did we finish. 

01:02:10
UNKNOWN 11:45. 

01:02:15
ROB MCNEILLY I finishing at 11:45. Oh, my goodness! Oh! 

01:02:20
[sil.] 

01:02:25
ROB MCNEILLY I was hoping to give you time to practice with this. Maybe… Maybe if we can… if I can do another demonstration then we're going to (inaudible) Oh, sorry. (inaudible) now. 

01:02:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:02:35
ROB MCNEILLY Okay, so let's… let's just for the sake of time I want to know that Patrick, you know, could we play this is just a request, you can say no. Is there something that you would want to do something about if you've got some problem that we could talk about here? Putting on the spot please feel free to say no. I'm just looking at a way of kind of shortening the whole process. No… nothing… nothing obvious. Okay, so I can have another someone else to come up here and thanks. You need to sign away your life on a piece of paper there, just make the checks (inaudible). 

01:03:20
[sil.] 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:03:45
ROB MCNEILLY I think… I think its… its (inaudible) that microphone, you should give additional (inaudible) I think. Hello! 

01:03:50
KASHA Hello! Sir. Kasha. 

01:03:50
ROB MCNEILLY Kash… 

01:03:50
KASHA Kasha. 

01:03:50
ROB MCNEILLY Kasha. 

01:03:50
KASHA Kasha. 

01:04:00
ROB MCNEILLY Thank you. Thanks for willing to play. 

01:04:00
KASHA Sure. 

01:04:00
ROB MCNEILLY And what are you wanting to do here Kasha? Is to do start with the same kind of conversation I had with… with Patrick. But this time to give a little focus so I'm going to be looking to if you to have an actual problem something that you wanted to do something with, so then I can… we can explore what's missing for you and it's going to be quite abbreviated and the time constraints. So I'm much sort of rush (inaudible) and to try to get away with that… with that being disrespectful. 

01:04:30
KASHA Okay. 

01:04:30
ROB MCNEILLY And once we've worked at what's missing for you then we're going to go looking for it in the (inaudible) and then see how we can connect with that. That's the short version of what we're going to play… So Kasha what… what… what… what… where are you from? 

01:04:50
KASHA Originally from Poland, but Santiago. 

01:04:50
ROB MCNEILLY Poland. 

01:04:50
KASHA I'm from Santiago (inaudible). 

01:04:55
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible). 

01:04:55
KASHA (inaudible). 

01:04:55
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, I… I know that two words in a few language. Uh… I don't know how to say thank you in Polish. 

01:05:00
KASHA Dzi?kuj?. 

01:05:05
ROB MCNEILLY Dzi?kuj?. Oh yes, dzi?kuj?… dzi?kuj?. Uh… So what have you been doing recently that's been fun, that's been enjoyable that you thought off I could do a bit more there's this will be great. 

01:05:15
KASHA I haven't been doing more of it, but I would like to maybe which is dancing. 

01:05:20
ROB MCNEILLY Dancing, yes. When someone says I like dancing, I think here we go, you cannot have problem with dancing. 

01:05:30
[sil.] 

01:05:35
ROB MCNEILLY Beautiful. So what is it that you like about dancing? 

01:05:40
KASHA Umm… I like the spontaneity… 

01:05:40
ROB MCNEILLY She likes the spontaneity. 

01:05:40
KASHA Movement. 

01:05:45
ROB MCNEILLY And movement. 

01:05:45
KASHA Music. 

01:05:45
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. Just see the spontaneity that you see when you dancing in the spontaneous movement, there's no stiffness, there's no it's all there. Beautiful… So is there something that we could uh… make some difference to (inaudible) that you'd be willing to I'm not saying, you know, probably wouldn't make it worse but well, that's possible, but probably not. 

01:06:10
KASHA Yeah, I… I have so easy cliché, I'm sort of embarrassed to share it. 

01:06:15
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

01:06:15
KASHA But I'm gonna put it out there anyway… 

01:06:20
ROB MCNEILLY What? 

01:06:20
KASHA Which is I've a lot of love. I've wonderful children blah… blah… blah. 

01:06:25
ROB MCNEILLY She has a wonderful love, wonderful children. 

01:06:25
KASHA I would somehow wanna more love. 

01:06:30
ROB MCNEILLY You want more love. Okay, so how can (inaudible) more love is important to you, silly question, but anyhow I'll ask it. 

01:06:35
KASHA There is a part of me that feels inherently unloved at times. 

01:06:40
ROB MCNEILLY Oh, you are Polish. 

01:06:45
KASHA (inaudible) this is my roots. 

01:06:45
ROB MCNEILLY There's no cure for that so… 

01:06:50
KASHA That's right. This nobody likes it… 

01:06:50
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah… You got enemies around always have the… But… 

01:06:55
KASHA (inaudible). 

01:06:55
ROB MCNEILLY Erickson said we need to study anthropology if we want to work with it, but umm… so I got… I got lost in my anthropological thing. What is it about how come you want more love? What… what is that? 

01:07:10
KASHA Yeah, I don't understand your question. 

01:07:15
ROB MCNEILLY You want more love? 

01:07:15
KASHA Mm-hmm. 

01:07:15
ROB MCNEILLY How come this is important to you? 

01:07:20
KASHA Well, I felt like when I… Why do I want it. 

01:07:25
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

01:07:25
KASHA (inaudible) if I know. Umm… 

01:07:30
ROB MCNEILLY What it is about wanting love that's important to you. Whether it's about… 

01:07:30
KASHA It's the connection… 

01:07:35
ROB MCNEILLY Okay. 

01:07:35
KASHA The closeness. 

01:07:35
ROB MCNEILLY Closeness, very good. 

01:07:40
KASHA It's the… it's the beauty and warmth of it. 

01:07:40
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, the closeness, the connection, the beauty and warmth of it. 

01:07:45
KASHA Peace in the world… 

01:07:45
ROB MCNEILLY Please can you… can you start to hear the connection between, you know, what's… what's missing here and what's present in the dancing, can you start to see the juxtaposition there, not totally clear perhaps yet, but let's… let's see as we… as we go. So what's missing for you that if you had, you already have love but if you had more love what's missing for you that if you could have that you'd have more love, so there will be more… 

01:08:10
KASHA I would I guess I would feel like I fully belong and I'm fully okay. 

01:08:20
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) so you… so you… so that you fully belong and you… and you fully okay. 

01:08:30
KASHA Mm-hmm. 

01:08:30
ROB MCNEILLY All right, okay. So that's what's missing. This is very simplistic and because of the time we've got a really pushing this kind of a… a bit… bit abrupt, but just to make the… the point. So can we go dancing? 

01:08:50
KASHA Yes. 

01:08:50
ROB MCNEILLY All right… all right. So just in whatever way that makes sense to you. Okay and as you allow yourself to remember the experience of going dancing. As you recall a particular time or maybe we start with this and then go to that or maybe general feeling I don't know and it really doesn't matter. But you know the experience for your dancing, the spontaneity, it's spontaneous, you're moving, yeah and… 

01:09:25
KASHA Partner. 

01:09:25
ROB MCNEILLY And partner or a partner and as you allow yourself to focus in whatever way you happen to be, in your experience you're dancing, you're moving, spontaneous, the partner and as you are in this experience which is yours. How can you allow yourself to be even more…(inaudible). Than you already are? And just allowing yourself to be as absorbed as you are without being concerned about whether you (inaudible) absorbed as you think you should or I think you should or something but just to be okay and connect with your absorption in any way that you are. And as you doing this anyone could look and see. If you look at Kasha you can see even though she's dancing there's some stillness in her body here and there's a slight smile on your face almost like you're enjoying your experience. Then you breathing that's it. Just that little bit slow I don't know whether you can see it, its little deeper that's it. And you close your eyes spontaneously and there's some little fluttery movements of your eyelids. You probably can't see it from back there, but I can see there is a little fluttering movements of your eyelids. That lets me know that you are in this experience. And as you are in this can you allow yourself to notice your experience of feeling connected and notice your experience of being fully okay. You must experience your dancing, it's spontaneous, those movement, your partner and you're connecting, fully connecting. Can you feel that? And that you are okay? Can you feel that? Yeah, good. So if can you take a moment to somehow. 

01:12:15
[sil.] 

01:12:20
ROB MCNEILLY That even more connected than you already with your experience at dancing, just (inaudible) yourself really be in this. 

01:12:30
[sil.] 

01:12:35
ROB MCNEILLY Like you can (inaudible) really get into the experience of dancing and you're doing that I think good. But then Kasha, I could say that getting even more love is what dancing. 

01:13:00
[sil.] 

01:13:10
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) What is it about your experience of dancing that can help you to be even more fully connected, more fully okay, so that you can have even more love than you already have. And I can ask you that question and I don't need you to answer you, you're welcome too. The main thing is that you can have that connection yourself. It'll be okay with it. Are you're going to say something? Yeah? 

01:13:45
KASHA Where that came to me was open. 

01:13:50
ROB MCNEILLY Where that came to you was open. (inaudible) so open when you're dancing. And when you're dancing and you're open is that help you to be more open to receiving more love? 

01:14:00
KASHA Mm-hmm. 

01:14:05
ROB MCNEILLY You being more fully connected, more fully okay, you're open to that? 

01:14:10
KASHA Mm-hmm. 

01:14:10
ROB MCNEILLY Mm… 

01:14:10
KASHA And sort of trusting I have. 

01:14:10
ROB MCNEILLY And sort of trusting that yes. Because I don't know but I can imagine that when you first learned to dance it took a little while to be open to that. 

01:14:25
KASHA Not… 

01:14:25
ROB MCNEILLY Not very long. You were a quick learner. 

01:14:30
KASHA I… I dance before I walked. 

01:14:30
ROB MCNEILLY She danced before she walked. I don't know (inaudible) dance right out of the womb, Billy Elliot (inaudible). 

01:14:40
KASHA Oh, I think. 

01:14:40
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, I dance right out of the womb. I dance before I was born. But you dance soon after you're born anyhow. That's easy for you. 

01:14:50
KASHA Mm-hmm. 

01:14:55
ROB MCNEILLY And because dancing is easy for you. 

01:14:55
KASHA Effortless. 

01:14:55
ROB MCNEILLY It's effortless. Because it's effortless, you can now enjoy discovering, learning, using, connecting with your openness to connecting more fully to being fully okay and being open to having more love and you're smiling. 

01:15:30
KASHA Mm-hmm. I want to say sweet. 

01:15:35
ROB MCNEILLY Sweet. You want to say sweet. Say it. She says sweet. Okay. So can you just sit with this for a moment and when you… when you're ready you don't have to stay in this experience forever because you can return to it anytime. You know, there might be times when you don't really feel like stopping… you don't feel like stopping the dancing, but you can always get back to it. So would it be okay if just in a moment just as soon as you're ready you come off the dance floor, you stop the dancing for the moment, you come back into this room and before you go what's different now than when we started? 

01:16:20
KASHA Sweetness. 

01:16:20
ROB MCNEILLY Sweetness. 

01:16:20
KASHA Certain openness. 

01:16:25
ROB MCNEILLY Certain openness. 

01:16:30
KASHA I mean, you look like a friendly follow from the beginning, you still are. 

01:16:35
ROB MCNEILLY Really. So, you know, there that man he said he jumped off 100 story building, 99, 98, 97 I'm doing all right so far. So I seem like a friendly follow. And in other words, somehow you more open to me and my wanting to put words in your mouth and you're more open to me now than you were before we started this conversation. 

01:17:00
KASHA What I actually noticed in the experience is we are going through that I was willing to go deeper that into circumstance go forward. 

01:17:05
ROB MCNEILLY Yes… yes… yes… yes. So again this… this kind of experience helps the… helps the trusting in the relationship. And also do… do you see how there's some possibilities now the future not… not certainties but there are some things that you might be more open to now. 

01:17:25
KASHA And maybe the way even I see sort of shortcuts. 

01:17:30
ROB MCNEILLY Mm-hmm. 

01:17:30
KASHA Like metaphor. 

01:17:30
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, so there's some expecting there. So beautiful, thank you so much for trusting me with that. 

01:17:40
KASHA Thank you. 

01:17:40
ROB MCNEILLY And it will be okay people ask some questions (inaudible) it's very clear to you what was happening because you are in your experience. 

01:17:50
KASHA Right. 

01:17:50
ROB MCNEILLY But someone looking (inaudible) what was this so I don't know that. Will that be okay? 

01:17:55
KASHA Sure. 

01:17:55
ROB MCNEILLY So observations, questions. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN She never mentioned the music. 

01:18:00
ROB MCNEILLY She never mentioned the music. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:18:00
ROB MCNEILLY No. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN I expected her to say I was… I become lot more than (inaudible). 

01:18:05
ROB MCNEILLY She didn't. 

01:18:05
UNKNOWN music… 

01:18:10
ROB MCNEILLY She didn't mention the music. Not. 

01:18:15
KASHA Do you want me to answer this? 

01:18:15
ROB MCNEILLY Yes. 

01:18:15
KASHA Apparently so with that wasn't for whatever reason (inaudible) the kind of moving and twirling and turning. 

01:18:25
ROB MCNEILLY So she didn't mention the music, she mentioned spontaneous movement… 

01:18:35
KASHA And freedom like… 

01:18:35
ROB MCNEILLY And freedom. So I said spontaneous movement. She didn't talk about music. I didn't talk about music. If she talked about music I'm going to talk about music. If I'd put music in that would have been a function of me which I probably would have been okay. 

01:18:50
UNKNOWN But she didn't mention it. 

01:18:50
ROB MCNEILLY She didn't mentioned, so I didn't mention. Is that answer of your question, there's nothing wrong with it, but (inaudible) to say she didn't mention the music, it's like for you the music might have been something to mention and for me I was thinking, you know, Poly does a poker or something else or some kind of Polish dance or something (inaudible) that's me. I just going to focus on. Yeah. 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN How many senses do you need? 

01:19:25
ROB MCNEILLY How many sessions do you need? 

01:19:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:19:30
ROB MCNEILLY I don't know. 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN Did you hear the music (inaudible). 

01:19:30
KASHA You know what… It's interesting as you guys mentioned it I certainly love music, but I don't think that I hear music in my head like people do. I have no (inaudible) in my body so I know some people hear music, I… I listen to music, but I'm so much (inaudible). 

01:19:50
ROB MCNEILLY So as to how many sessions though see it depends umm… 

01:19:55
KASHA I guess it depends where we going. 

01:20:00
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, so in…in… in response to… 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN Senses not sessions. 

01:20:00
KASHA Oh! 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN Senses. 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN Senses. You're taking how many senses… 

01:20:05
ROB MCNEILLY Oh, senses. I'm sorry. 

01:20:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible) may be you just (inaudible) one thing (inaudible). 

01:20:10
ROB MCNEILLY Well, I think that… that happens. The answer to that question will happen by… by you listening rather than me speaking. 

01:20:20
KASHA I was seeing myself dancing. I was kinda feeling inside my body, but I don't know I was still I don't know. 

01:20:35
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) You could feel in your body, but you're still I mean, really make up your mind. You know, (inaudible) you're still moving, yes. 

01:20:45
KASHA (inaudible) movement process. 

01:20:45
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

01:20:45
KASHA Process but I was really… 

01:20:45
ROB MCNEILLY So the… the… the question is legitimate question an important one and you will get the answer for each individual person by listening to what the other person says. And if you want more, you can ask. 

01:21:00
UNKNOWN Necessarily you missed that like do you hear something, you feel something… 

01:21:00
ROB MCNEILLY You can ask. 

01:21:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:21:05
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) either that… that's for you. Sometimes I ask and sometimes I don't. 

01:21:15
KASHA I mean, I know when I (inaudible) I ask like if you could probably smell or something… 

01:21:20
ROB MCNEILLY Good question. 

01:21:20
KASHA And some music I could probably (inaudible). You asked me but I was going to the image and the internal sensation of… 

01:21:30
ROB MCNEILLY So we're… we're kind of doing a bit of a squishy thing here because of the time. If there was more time we might, you know, what else… what else (inaudible) and so. 

01:21:35
UNKNOWN What was the hypnosis session (inaudible)? 

01:21:40
ROB MCNEILLY Yes. 

01:21:40
KASHA How long? 

01:21:40
ROB MCNEILLY Yes, I heard the question. 

01:21:45
UNKNOWN Forty five minutes. 

01:21:50
ROB MCNEILLY You know, five minutes three hours. Thirty years. Yeah, I think we make a stop and uh… then we do… what we do and then usually the client will say that's enough or I want more. I've had situations where I'm just getting started and the client says "Well, I'm… I'm done, I'm finished." And other times where uh… I'm… I'm already just to stop and they just getting started. So you find out by asking really feedback, thank you. Yeah. 

01:22:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:22:35
ROB MCNEILLY Oops! 

01:22:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible) or what happened to the (inaudible). 

01:22:40
ROB MCNEILLY What… what happened with the problem? 

01:22:45
KASHA Well, we open this to open this and sweetness or something that kind of positive… 

01:22:50
ROB MCNEILLY We didn't deal with the problem. And that's unpopular because it's avoiding, you're not dealing with the real problem. I am determined to do everything I can to avoid the problem of experiencing being run over by a bus. I'm going to persist with that. 

01:23:15
UNKNOWN Can you say that again? 

01:23:15
ROB MCNEILLY It's an important… important point. This is not a problem solving approach. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN We cannot follow. 

01:23:25
ROB MCNEILLY If… if a person has a problem of wanting more love by being more open, more okay, more… more fully present and they have that they don't have a problem. So the problem isn't solved, its dissolved. It's a different… different process. 

01:23:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:23:55
ROB MCNEILLY But it seemed weird doesn't it. You know some people say "Oh, this is very superficially, you're not dealing with the real problem. Ask someone who had a real problem and it's dissolved and they usually okay. 

01:24:10
UNKNOWN Assume like you change the association to it. 

01:24:10
ROB MCNEILLY Change the? 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN Association to it. 

01:24:15
ROB MCNEILLY I don't know… I don't know how to explain it. I think that all… all I can do is to demonstrate something and then invite you to play with that and make your own sense of it. I… I don't have a list that's to complicated question for my simple brain its… all right. 

01:24:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible) resource that you're you listening… 

01:24:35
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible) yeah. 

01:24:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible) somehow I don't know how either in viewing the problem or accompanying the problem in a way that changes the relationship… 

01:24:50
ROB MCNEILLY Well, I would say it changes the relationship with the experience so that it's… they're not problematic but just something that you can learn or do deal with. So its… it's the relationship with the situation changes and what was a problem now because it is a situation that was a problem and now it's a situation that's not a problem that's how I describe it. 

01:25:20
UNKNOWN It seems to me that with both of the volunteers (inaudible) essence of what happened was that you both indirectly and directly gave them a mission to change. 

01:25:35
ROB MCNEILLY Mm-hmm. 

01:25:35
UNKNOWN And I think that (inaudible) was going on. 

01:25:45
ROB MCNEILLY Yes, exactly. I would take it one step further and saying not only permission to change but I'm as much as possible generating an expectancy that change is inevitable. It's… it's a… it's a curve board, it's skewed biased position, it's not a neutral position, it's a nudge in position. Thanks… Yes. 

01:26:15
UNKNOWN When I (inaudible) that was the initial what's missing was dancing. 

01:26:20
ROB MCNEILLY Yes. 

01:26:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:26:20
ROB MCNEILLY What's missing? 

01:26:25
UNKNOWN Is dancing. 

01:26:25
ROB MCNEILLY No… no… no. What's missing was connection. 

01:26:30
UNKNOWN No, (inaudible) initially it starting with dancing… 

01:26:30
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah… yeah, so what if we look at what's missing like in the problem here's the problem the problem was… was full of connection and being okay and so. And we see that's missing that's why she wasn't getting more love, it's missing which is why that's a problem and its present in the dancing. 

01:26:55
UNKNOWN What was interesting to me… 

01:26:55
ROB MCNEILLY (inaudible). 

01:26:55
UNKNOWN What was interesting to me is that she was dancing alone what (inaudible) dancing. 

01:27:00
ROB MCNEILLY No, she said she had a partner. 

01:27:05
UNKNOWN Oh, you did have a partner. 

01:27:05
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah… yeah, she said that. 

01:27:05
UNKNOWN Yeah… 

01:27:05
ROB MCNEILLY She said that partner maybe you couldn't (inaudible). 

01:27:10
KASHA I did have a partner, yes. 

01:27:15
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah, she had a partner. Question… 

01:27:20
UNKNOWN It seems to (inaudible) what you are doing (inaudible) my interest is there it seems so (inaudible) like when treating anxiety, teaching people to sit with your anxiety and (inaudible) with your anxiety. 

01:27:30
ROB MCNEILLY Yes. 

01:27:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

01:27:35
ROB MCNEILLY Yeah. 

01:27:35
UNKNOWN So opposite of that. 

01:27:35
ROB MCNEILLY Well, one of my teachers (inaudible) said it's a problem being half hours whichever cheek is missing. So sometimes it's useful to sit with the anxiety and there are some anxieties that… that are best avoided like if I put my hand on a hot… hot plate on the stove, I'll get anxious. Now I'm gonna sit with it, I'm gonna about it. So I'm looking at the practicalities here and I'm inviting (inaudible) consider saying you must or you mustn't to just increase the options. Now we have to finish. Thank you so much for so… 

01:28:15
[sil.] 

01:28:20
ROB MCNEILLY So I just wanted to put in a plug for my… for my book. Its just… just there and if you wanting to find out more about this and what we've been doing the book is there. So I'm doing a transparent bid of marketing here. 

01:28:35
KASHA That this book. 

01:28:35
ROB MCNEILLY That's the book… that's the book. That's in the book, yeah. And also I've got umm… a series of about 35-minute videos that if you sign up from my website you can have free access to those. They're just another easy introduction into what we've been playing with it. So I think it's time to stop and thank you so much for being willing to be here. There are a lot of other places you could be. And thanks for your willingness to be (inaudible) as to what we've been playing with (inaudible). If you've got any questions I'm about here. Thanks.
