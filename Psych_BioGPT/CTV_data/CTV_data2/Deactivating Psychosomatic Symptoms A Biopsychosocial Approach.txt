BRIEF THERAPY 

00:00:55
INSIDE OUT 

00:00:55
With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:00:55
and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief Therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal, and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategist in the area of Brief Therapy; each will demonstrate their approach with real people, with real life problems.

DEACTIVATING PSYCHOSOMATIC SYMPTOMS: A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL APPROACH 

00:01:40
LEN SPERRY, M.D., PH.D. 

00:01:50
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. I'd like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:01:55
1-1 

00:01:55
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos, and this is our guest today, Len Sperry, who's going to talk to us about his approach to Brief Therapy. Len, how would you define brief therapy? 

00:02:05
LEN SPERRY I would define it as, rather simply, doing therapy in a focused fashion. I don't put a limit on the number of sessions. Although, it can be as, uh, little as a single session, or it could be many, I, I, don't think the number is the issue. I think, the emphasis is on focusing, and the emphasis is on coming to some kind of, uh, of, of, of a closure as opposed to the opposite of Brief Therapy, which is, which is interminable therapy, which is therapy that goes on forever, and there really isn't any kind of... 

00:02:50
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Woody Allen kind of therapy? 

00:02:50
LEN SPERRY Very much so. So no progress and no end in sight. 

00:02:55
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:02:55
1-2 

00:02:55
LEN SPERRY Brief Therapy's just the other side of it, it has a sight in mind, and, and, and a definite plan for getting there. 

00:03:05
JON CARLSON Well can you help us understand your approach to Brief Therapy, you know, what, what are the steps or stages that it follows? 

00:03:10
LEN SPERRY All right. Well I would prefer to describe it as an orientation rather than, uh, than an approach or a theory, and by orientation I mean, that at this point I don't believe there's, there's enough, uh, research evidence, there's enough, even clinical experience base, for us to, to say we have a theory of, or a, a fully developed approach to Brief Therapy. But we can say this, and that's what I would contend, that we have an orientation, and the orientation is to a client and the therapist relationship to the client. So real, real specifically if I may. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON Yeah, how does it work? 

00:03:55
1-3 

00:03:55
Len Sperry, M.D., Ph.D. 

00:03:55
LEN SPERRY The, the focus on the client means that I start with the assumption that the client is the locust (ph) of change. I can't do the change for them, it comes from them. Self-healing is the basis for all change in medical as well as in the psychological therapies. The second point is, is that, uh, if it's client centered, it means that the client, as well as the, the therapist or any other providers that are working with them, have to understand the client's formulation, that is their explanation for why they're having the symptoms they're having. 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:04:40
1-4 

00:04:40
LEN SPERRY Now, with the, the second part of this, after a client focus is, is an emphasis on the bio-cycle social formulation, and that is an explanation that works holistically and comprehensively enough and in an integrative fashion for how the three domains of the biological or the somatic, the psychological, and then the social or systemic, uh, really interrelate, and how they drive a person's, uh, behavior, and, and how they actually accord the person a sense of meaning in their life. So, that becomes affected through the role of the therapist and the therapist, in my orientation, is someone that, that has to be, uh, able to, to function in, in varying roles, the role of coach most of the time. 

00:05:30
Jon Carlson, Psy. D., Ed. D., ABPP 

00:05:35
JON CARLSON And can instill hope for something in the client. 

00:05:35
1-5 

00:05:35
LEN SPERRY Instilling hope, and, and also offering the individual, uh, suggestions, offering them, uh, some support, offering them some corrective feedback. Uh, at other times, the therapist needs to be a conductor, needs to be the expert, and, and in many instances such as, uh, of, the interview with, with Kathleen, there's gonna be the element of, of the wizard. So there's gonna be some magic making that takes place too. 

00:06:05
JON CARLSON How about drill sergeant? Does that come in, where you get a chance to be this dominator at times in this approach? 

00:06:10
LEN SPERRY Well, I, I, that's sort of the conductor, you know, you're the, everyone plays by the conductors score, and, and, that's the expert role, I.... 

00:06:15
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) Okay. All right. 

00:06:15
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

00:06:20
DIANE KJOS Well, just what are the, what's the roots or the basis of this? How did you get to this approach, for yourself? 

00:06:25
LEN SPERRY Bio-cycle social orientation is one that's been around forever, since the beginning. I, I think it probably was the, was the first of, uh, of the approaches. So when Hippocrates talked about the, the, about the four humors, he was talking really about the bio-cycle social approach. 

00:06:45
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Oh. 

00:06:45
JON CARLSON So whence was the treatment of choice? 

00:06:45
1-6 

00:06:50
LEN SPERRY Yes. More, more recently, George Engle in the late, uh, 50's, early 60's started talk, writing about the bio-cycle social model, and it was adopted very quickly in psychiatry as an approach that was different from the prevailing bio-medical model. Now, in the last half a dozen years the American Psychological Association, as it's moved to more of an understanding of, of, uh, psychology, psychotherapy being, uh, a healthcare specialty has endorsed the bio-cycle social model also. 

00:07:30
JON CARLSON Well you were trained yourself though as a psychologist originally. 

00:07:30
LEN SPERRY Yes, I was. 

00:07:35
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) And, uh, how did you move on? What was your thinking as you moved more in to the, was it to learn this biological part of things? 

00:07:40
1-7 

00:07:40
LEN SPERRY Well I became, uh, painfully and immediately aware of, of the, the biological component, with, uh, my work, both with individuals and with families. When illnesses such as diabetes, uh, were causing all kinds of havoc and had, had I been, uh, trained much later, I would've had, uh, ample opportunity to start to learn the bio-cycle social model 'cuz it's being taught in graduate schools, uh, routinely today. 

00:08:15
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) Now, yeah. 

00:08:15
LEN SPERRY But it wasn't 30 years ago and that's one of the reasons I went back to medical school. 

00:08:20
JON CARLSON So you kind of pioneered this approach. Can, can you talk about how change takes place though? I guess I'm still not sure. 

00:08:25
LEN SPERRY All right. Well the process of change is still not very well understood. What exactly causes, uh, a reversal in a way the client thinks, the way the client acts, and even the way their whole biological being starts changing because this change does occur. We know that, that, that, the, that the, uh, brain structure actually starts accommodating those change. 

00:08:55
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:08:55
LEN SPERRY We know that the, uh, person's neural hormonal system actually starts shifting and changing their (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:09:03
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) They look different. They look different. 

00:09:03
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:09:03
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) They can be look different, yes. 

00:09:03
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:09:03
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:09:03
1-8 

00:09:03
LEN SPERRY They can very much look different. So. 

00:09:05
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Right. So how, how do you bring about change? I mean, what's this bio-cycle social, how does it work? 

00:09:10
LEN SPERRY Well, I, I would think about it in terms of, of, of strategies. Maybe that's, uh, a useful way of beginning this discussion and I would see the, the change process as involving, first a way of connecting with the client and today that's being talked about as engagement. 

00:09:35
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Engagement, okay. 

00:09:35
1-9 

00:09:35
LEN SPERRY Right, and so, so with much bigger and much broader than empathy, it involves a way of joining a person, but even more importantly it involves understanding the person's formulation, understanding their own explanation, understanding their expectations for treatment, understanding their readiness for change. All right? They may not, they may not be ready right at this moment. 

00:10:00
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:10:00
LEN SPERRY They may show good intentions by coming to treatment, but the therapist who's not, not keyed into that may start, uh, way above the level that they're at. So... 

00:10:15
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Right. Mm-hmm. Sometimes we just assume that people are ready for action and ready. They're just maybe contemplating a change. 

00:10:25
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Yeah. And they're not. And they're not! 

00:10:25
JOHN CARLSON Yeah. 

00:10:25
LEN SPERRY So would one engage the person. First, the second main strategy and stage also, would be to do an adequate enough assessment of the individual, so that we would be able to understand the patterns in their life. 

00:10:40
JON CARLSON An engagement assessment. 

00:10:40
1-10 

00:10:40
LEN SPERRY And then the third, the third stage and, and, uh, strategy at the same time, is, is then to establish some kind of, a, of, of, of, of, a, of, of a treatment goal, and, uh, and sort of treatment interventions, to modify that, that, uh, uh, that pattern or those series of patterns. So in a Brief Therapy, we're not talking about reconfiguring and restructuring a person's whole character, their whole personality. We're talking about shifting their patterns in a way that's going to be much more, uh, conducive to them being, uh, responsible, them being able to cooperate better, them being able to, to be a transcendent person, and not, uh, not sort of stuck in, in, um, in the rut they are in their lives. And in the fourth, the strategy, fourth stage really is to maintain those changes and to prevent relapse. 

00:11:40
JON CARLSON And we don't, we don't do with of that maintenance, 'cuz, like, you know, by reading literature, that people often will go back to previous levels of functioning, when we successfully treat them. 

00:11:50
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Right. Yeah. 

00:11:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:11:50
LEN SPERRY Right, and I think many people who, who are, uh, experimenting with different ways of doing Brief Therapy have come on to the idea that you don't wait till the end to start working on, on, uh, preventing relapse and recurrence, but you start really, right at the beginning. 

00:12:10
DIANE KJOS I see, I see a lot of similarities to other brief therapies, but I see what, seems to be what's different about your approach is this paying attention to the, I mean, giving words to paying attention to the bio-cycle social. 

00:12:25
LEN SPERRY Yes. 

00:12:25
DIANE KJOS I think others do to differing degrees, but would you say that that's the kind of difference that, how this compares, and what makes it (crosstalk inaudible )? 

00:12:34
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Yes. It probably is, and, and it's, it's an approach that is particularly useful with certain kinds of clinical situations, and, and it's almost in those situations demanded. 

00:12:45
Diane Kjos(crosstalk)Oh. All right. And what would those be? 

00:12:45
LEN SPERRY Well, with the complex, uh, difficult, uh, presentations where symptoms are diffused and some people would say, smoky. 

00:12:55
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:12:55
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Right. 

00:12:55
1-12 

00:12:55
LEN SPERRY So it's not clear if the person is a medical problem. It, it's not clear, if, if, if, if it's medical and psychological, or medical and, and, uh, systems related. 

00:13:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) And even environmental, sure. Yeah. 

00:13:10
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Or environmental. So we have those situations. There, there's also two other situations, at least two, where, where, uh, the bio-cycle social orientation has, uh, value clinically, and those are when you have the axis five individual, the axis five client or patient. 

00:13:30
JOHN CARLSON (crosstalk) What's that mean? 

00:13:30
LEN SPERRY Which means they have all five axes, there's, the, that, that have to be the focus of treatment. So they have one or more axis one, major symptom, uh, disorder. 

00:13:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) DSM four. 

00:13:40
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Mm-hmm 

00:13:40
LEN SPERRY DSM four disorders such as, uh, major depression, or, uh, or, uh, a panic disorder, of, and axis two when there's a concurrent, uh, personality disorder. 

00:13:55
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) When they show issues. 

00:13:55
Len Sperry, M.D., Ph.D. 

00:13:55
1-13 

00:13:55
1-14 

00:13:55
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Yeah, almost always we're talking with, uh, with the personality disorders as the bio, as, needing to pay attention to the biological, in this case, the temperament component, because without, without attending to that, you can't really deal with the psychological. I'm going to give you a quick example. The, the person with a, with a borderline personality disorder, that's depressed or has some medical problems on top of that, usually are so affectively labiled or out of control that if, if, uh, their temperament isn't, uh, the focus of treatment initially, you may never really be able to, to get their, uh, psychological attention and, and, uh, have them feel that they're in enough control over their, uh, uh, acting out behaviors, if it involves, uh, uh, uh, self-harm, behaviors like slashing, of, or, or they're constantly, uh, becoming, um, uh, so in, involved in , uh, projective identification, that they can't, they can't really focus on an issue. So, there's obviously a, axis three, is, uh, medical disorders and then severe stressors in axis four, and, uh, then GAF or global assessment of functioning, that's, that's, that's really quite low. So, when we're talking about individuals who are below, about, uh, 45 or so on the GF, we're not talking about the typical psychotherapy, typical counseling client. We're talking about someone whose, who has, a, a rather complex, uh, sort of lifestyle of, of dysfunction. Their whole life and the life's around them have, are, are sufficiently disrupted and impaired that they, they, they really are not going to be, to be as adequately, uh, approached, and I think respond to change if you use a single modality and, and your focus is only on the psychological or only on the systemic. 

00:16:00
1-16 

00:16:00
JON CARLSON That sounds like it's really integrative in, in what you do with this approach, it sounds like, you know the, the one approach might just deal with talking and one might use acting, one might use feelings. It sounds like you tailor this approach depending on the presentation or the diagnosis. 

00:16:15
LEN SPERRY Tailoring is, is a critical part of it. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON In, in a minute we're going to watch you work with, uh, uh, a challenging young woman, Kathleen. Can you set this up for us and for our audience, for our viewers, what they might look for? 

00:16:30
LEN SPERRY Sure. Kathleen is an individual that's pretty convinced that she has seizures and, and, uh, a kind of panic that, uh, would present itself in, in, a, in a person with, uh, uh, a somatic personality and... 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) And her body physically okay? 

00:16:55
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:16:55
LEN SPERRY And, and what I asked the, uh, viewers to look for, is how these, these biological presentations that she has relate to the rest of her life. 

00:17:10
1-16 

00:17:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) What's implicated about your work though? Is there something that we, they should focus on with you? 

00:17:15
LEN SPERRY Sure. Uh, focus on, on my efforts to try to understand her frame of reference or her formulation of this, of, of this concern she has and focus on, also on my efforts to try to, after I have some understanding of that, which is, becomes a shared understanding, that she and I work together to try to change that formulation or that story, or that narrative, in a way that's gonna be useful for her. 'Cuz right now, she's at, at her wit's end, and, and her life is not moving ahead. In fact it's moving backwards. So how can we help her get her life moving in the direction that she wants? How can I help her use the, the resources she has, the strengths she has as a person to, to be more of the person that, that she was meant to be? 

00:18:10
DIANE KJOS This should be interesting. 

00:18:15
1-17 

00:18:15
JON CARLSON Yeah, let's watch the process. 

00:18:15
2-1 

00:18:15
LEN SPERRY Okay. Hello Kathleen. What concerns, uh, brought you to this, uh, this, uh, session today? 

00:18:25
2-2 

00:18:25
KATHLEEN Well I, um, been having, uh, panic attacks or they might call it epilepsy, um, for like about five or six years now. Right before I got married, I was having these attacks where it would start coming up my leg and going into my, my arm. I'd get like really, really tight, and it'll go over to my left arm then go down my, my leg, and they never could understand what the problem was. I've gone to see, um, doctors and currently seeing a therapist and a, um, psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist says that these panic attacks, the kind that I get, do not, um, you know they don't occur, uh, with a panic attack. So, 'cuz like I pass out and then I will, kind of like awake, like I might fall and hit my head, or something like that, and then I will, will awake and won't know where I'm at, and they say that those do not relate to panic attacks. So, but I think, to me I do get panic attacks, but they just cannot pinpoint what kind I do get. 

00:19:45
LEN SPERRY So you mentioned panic attacks and epilepsy or seizures? 

00:19:45
KATHLEEN Correct. 

00:19:50
LEN SPERRY So, in your mind do you have one or both? 

00:19:55
KATHLEEN Um, in one way I think I have both, and in the other I think have panic. I really, I really wish I could pinpoint down what kind of, either, either/or I have. 

00:20:10
LEN SPERRY Okay. If you could do that? 

00:20:15
KATHLEEN Yes. 

00:20:15
LEN SPERRY How would your life be different? 

00:20:15
2-3 

00:20:15
KATHLEEN Oh, much better, much better. I wouldn't, like, have to worry about anything or, I mean I know people worry about things, but I would feel more at ease with life. Um, you know with being married and everything, you know I have to think of, uh, really, um, if we want to have children, my husband and I, I have to get off medication first, or see if I'm well enough to have children. So that kind of is, uh, not worrisome, but it's on my, it's on both of our minds. 

00:20:55
LEN SPERRY So if you could get clarity, whether it's one or both, it would make all the difference in the world? 

00:21:05
2-4 

00:21:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Oh, much, it would because I'd be able to, like I say, enjoy life. I'd be happy. 'Cuz I mean, I just don't laugh. I just sit there and I'm like a bum. I just don't, my husband like laughs and everything. He's like, "Why don't you laugh?" I say, "I can't!" But when I'm away from him, 'cuz I volunteer at a hospital, in a gift shop, I'm fine. I'm happy. I'm content there. It's like every time that I go to start a job, that's when it happens. I get panicky. 

00:21:35
LEN SPERRY A job you mean, not a volunteer? 

00:21:35
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) A job, correct. No. When I go to start a job, I get all panicky and then I can't work, and then my husband gets all mad with me, saying, you know he's like, "Well why can't you get this job, why can't you stay on a job?" And, you know he doesn't get like really violently mad, but he just gets upset which I don't blame him. 'Cuz he was going to, uh, Purdue University, in Hammond, Indiana. 

00:22:00
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:22:00
KATHLEEN And at the time we were having, you know, problems with me having these attacks and, um, I was going, having these and he was about to graduate and, he, he just promised, he asked me, "Please don't have any of your attacks while I'm trying to have my finals." And what did I do? I had, I had panic the whole week of his... 

00:22:20
2-5 

00:22:20
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Oh my goodness. 

00:22:20
KATHLEEN And oh, was he mad, but at least he graduated and... 

00:22:25
LEN SPERRY How did he manage to do that? 

00:22:25
KATHLEEN I don't know, he just did. 

00:22:30
LEN SPERRY So, somehow he was able to take his final exams and? 

00:22:35
KATHLEEN Yes. Mm-hm. 

00:22:35
LEN SPERRY And didn't seem to, the, your, your symptoms didn't seem to make a difference? 

00:22:40
KATHLEEN No. 

00:22:40
LEN SPERRY What kind of difference did those symptoms make in your life during that time? 

00:22:45
KATHLEEN Well, we had to go from like a, um, we were planning our wedding at the time, and we had to go from like say, a 200 people wedding down to only 40. That's including myself and my husband. 

00:22:55
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:22:55
2-6 

00:22:55
KATHLEEN 'Cuz we had to, we said, why have a big wedding and the day of, me be on the floor with panic attacks, or whatever I have, and we have to cancel out and lose all the money? Well we just had a, um, uh, regular wedding and then we had, um, just a restaurant, um, reception, with our families and then we had a big party at the house, like for all our friends and everything, casual party, and I was so much better. 

00:23:25
LEN SPERRY Mm-hmm. 

00:23:25
KATHLEEN So. 

00:23:25
LEN SPERRY Did the thought ever occur to, did you discuss the both of you whether, maybe not to have any reception at all? 

00:23:35
KATHLEEN Um, what like a big reception or? 

00:23:35
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)None. Nothing. 

00:23:35
KATHLEEN Um, well, at first. 

00:23:40
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) I mean, because, at a, uh, um, reception with 200 people, could've had, uh, panic attacks. You could've had it at, with 40 people. 

00:23:45
KATHLEEN Right, but I was fine that day. 

00:23:50
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:23:50
KATHLEEN I was fine. 

00:23:50
LEN SPERRY What do you think accounts for that? 

00:23:55
KATHLEEN I don't know, I really don't. I mean I think I was, see if I don't think about it, I don't get them. 

00:24:00
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:24:00
KATHLEEN So I probably had a lot on my mind, where I said okay. You know, they just didn't even appear that day, and then that day we had our outside party. Nothing. Nothing happened that day 'cuz I was to be busy running around making sure everything was in its, uh, place and all. I was fine. 

00:24:20
2-7 

00:24:20
LEN SPERRY Was that sort of a rule for you, that you'd noticed then? If you're, um, if you're preoccupied, if you're got things that need to get done then, then it, it, that day it isn't a problem? 

00:24:35
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Yes. Right. If I'm preoccupied, like if I, you know, sit at home all the time, watching TV, or taking naps, then I, you're sitting in the same house and you're not doing nothing, where if you get out and volunteer or just go shopping, and not buy anything, at least you're out of the house, you're doing something. 

00:24:55
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Okay. Is that kind of an iron clad rule? I mean, it hasn't failed you yet? 

00:25:00
KATHLEEN Right. Yeah. I, I asked my husband, I said, "Now if I don't work, please can I have at least two or three days of volunteering?" And he's like, "Fine." 'Cuz I mean it will get me out of the house for at least four or five hours, and, um, around people that I love, or like a lot. 

00:25:15
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Okay. Any reason why you've set on, settled on two or three days, instead of one day or five days? 

00:25:20
2-8 

00:25:20
KATHLEEN No. I mean if I, um, I just said like two or three 'cuz I know she, the lady needs me one day, or two days, I'm sorry, a week and then plus we're planning on moving and so he's like, "Do two days a week of volunteering and then the rest of the week pack." You know, 'cuz like get ourselves packing 'cuz the house won't pack itself. 

00:25:45
LEN SPERRY You don't have that kind of house, that packs itself? 

00:25:45
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) No, I wish. I wish we did. 

00:25:50
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) All right. Yeah, and where are you going to be moving to? 

00:25:55
KATHLEEN Oh, hopefully, um, Oaklawn (ph). It's a suburb a little bit, um, southwest of where we're living right now. Get closer to family, 'cuz like all our friends and everything have moved. Our neighbors have moved and so it's kind of hard. 

00:26:10
LEN SPERRY Is that gonna be a good move? 

00:26:10
KATHLEEN I hope, because we've been in, it's been my house for 32 years. 

00:26:15
LEN SPERRY Oh it was in the family? 

00:26:15
KATHLEEN Right, it was my mom and dads', and that was my only house, that I've known, and, um... 

00:26:20
LEN SPERRY Well where are they? 

00:26:20
2-9 

00:26:25
KATHLEEN Oh, both of them are deceased. 

00:26:25
LEN SPERRY Oh, they are? 

00:26:25
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm, and I was the only child, so it was kind of hard at first and everything, and my husband same thing. His mom and dad are divorced, er, I'm sorry, uh, deceased too. And he never, see he right now, he is seeing a, uh, doctor and a therapist, 'cuz he has never really mourned his parents. 

00:26:45
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:26:50
KATHLEEN And I said, "Now, now you know how I feel!" 'Cuz I mean, I, I mourned but I didn't mourn, and that really affected me too. 

00:27:00
LEN SPERRY So there's more mourning for you to do, maybe? 

00:27:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Um, not really, No. I mean some, uh, like occasions, say maybe Mother's Day, Father's day, you know, like little things here and there will, or anniversaries, birthdays will come up, but it's not as bad. Where like with my husband it, he never, never mourned. He just took it real lightly. 

00:27:20
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:27:20
KATHLEEN And myself, I was never really allowed. 

00:27:20
LEN SPERRY All right, and how long ago was? 

00:27:25
2-10 

00:27:25
KATHLEEN Uh, my dad was, um, 12 years and my mom 11. 

00:27:30
LEN SPERRY All right. So they're very close together? 

00:27:30
KATHLEEN Um, nine weeks of each other. So, it was, it was hard. 

00:27:35
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:27:35
KATHLEEN But I had family and friends that were around. 

00:27:40
LEN SPERRY All right, and you got through things, uh... 

00:27:45
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Yeah, I got through. 

00:27:45
LEN SPERRY But then, but four or five years ago these, these things, these episodes, these attacks were started happening? 

00:27:50
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Mm, these things came up because... Right, because at first, in 1982, I start getting what they thought were, um, uh, epilepsy and I went through every test known to man. 

00:28:00
LEN SPERRY Kay, Is this 92? 

00:28:00
KATHLEEN Nah, 82, I'm sorry, 82. 

00:28:05
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) 82. 

00:28:05
KATHLEEN And I had every test that, um, sorry, excuse me, test known to man done. 

00:28:10
LEN SPERRY Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
2-11 

00:28:10
KATHLEEN And I came out fine. And now I think I need to see a neurologist to see what is wrong but if I went right now, it would come up, uh, negative, but what I need is the test to be done while I'm having my panic attack to see what is wrong. 

00:28:30
LEN SPERRY Mkay. You think that can, will be arranged? 

00:28:35
KATHLEEN Um, well, I would have to see if I could get one. 

00:28:40
LEN SPERRY Mm-hmm. 

00:28:40
KATHLEEN Done. 

00:28:40
LEN SPERRY How do they usually come on? 

00:28:40
KATHLEEN Oh, I just, um, I just get like really tense and I stop, I stop breathing, but then I tell myself, "Breath, breath, you know just keep breathing." 

00:28:50
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:28:50
KATHLEEN And then, it's like I'm lifting weights, that's the way I feel, and then I, my arm drops down and then maybe a few seconds later, it'll start up again, and I have to either be laying down on a couch or laying on a bed flat. 

00:29:05
LEN SPERRY All right. 

00:29:05
KATHLEEN So I don't fall anyway, 'cuz I don't want to hurt myself. 

00:29:10
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk) Right. And about how long would that whole episode last? 

00:29:10
KATHLEEN (crosstalk) Um, my last one I had lasted practically all day. All day long from, uh, from like 10 in the morning till almost nine at night. 

00:29:20
LEN SPERRY All right, and when was that, the last one? 

00:29:25
KATHLEEN Oh, probably in March. 

00:29:25
LEN SPERRY Of this year? 

00:29:30
KATHLEEN Yes. 

00:29:30
2-12 

00:29:30
LEN SPERRY All right, and when was the first one. 

00:29:30
KATHLEEN When was the first one? Hm, oh, that was around, few months before we got married, no, I, uh, I take that back, it was in. Let's see, [ph] when did he graduate, 92, had to been like, uh, fall of 92, that I've been doing, having these. 

00:29:50

00:29:55
KATHLEEN Um, December of 92. 

00:29:55
LEN SPERRY All right. 

00:29:55
KATHLEEN And that's when we were planning the wedding, and see I was planning, I was, we were gonna have the, like I said the big wedding and everything, and I think a lot, I would, if I try to, if I get a lot of stuff on my mind, you know built up and everything, then I get stressed and that brings on the panic. 

00:30:15
LEN SPERRY Will you describe that first panic, back in 1992 in the fall? 

00:30:20
2-13 

00:30:20
KATHLEEN The first one I had, I was in bed and all of a sudden I was, the pain came up my leg into my arm and I grabbed the bedpost and I went over to this side and I grabbed the bed post and I just, I didn't know what it was. 

00:30:35
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Right. 

00:30:35
KATHLEEN And I just called my husband, you know my husband I just called him and called him and he finally came in and then I got out of the bed and then it started again, and I sat on the floor and I held his hand and I went, you know same way and everything and we didn't know what to do. I mean we tried calling my, um, neurologist and everything, they wanted me to come in, but I couldn't go in. 

00:30:55
LEN SPERRY So what were you feeling? Cuz you were, these were what, like some, some, uh, sharp pains? 

00:31:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh god I didn't know what. Demons (inaudible ). Not sharp pains, no it was just, like really, really tight. 

00:31:10
LEN SPERRY Tightness? 

00:31:10
KATHLEEN Yeah, coming all the way up and going down, and then it would start all, over again, and I mean I had like, three, four hours. 

00:31:20
LEN SPERRY So this, these were shooting sensation? 

00:31:20
KATHLEEN Uh, No, just real tight. 

00:31:20
JON SPERRY Tight, tightness. 

00:31:20
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Tight. Mm-hmm. 

00:31:25
LEN SPERRY And what about other, other things you noticed? 

00:31:25
2-14 

00:31:25
KATHLEEN Um, Really those are the only kinds of experiences I get. 

00:31:30
LEN SPERRY All right, did you remember anything else, uh, at, at that first time, (inaudible ) does your breathing change? 

00:31:40
KATHLEEN Yes. My heart gets really, goes really fast, and then, um, I would stop breathing, like I'd get scared. 

00:31:45
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)All right. 

00:31:45
KATHLEEN And I. 

00:31:50
LEN SPERRY And hold your breath. 

00:31:50
KATHLEEN And then what I was told, you know, "Breath, breath, you know continue breathing, but slowly, now pace your breathing." 

00:31:55
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Okay. All right. What, what kind of feelings did you have. 

00:32:00
KATHLEEN Scariness, I was very scared. 

00:32:00
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)All right, how scared? 

00:32:05
KATHLEEN Um, Just as scared as you can get and just wishing they were over. 

00:32:10
LEN SPERRY Uh-huh. Um, Were you so scared that you thought, uh, something fatal was gonna happen? 

00:32:15
KATHLEEN No, not really, no, not that I was gonna die or anything, I was just scared, I was just, I wish they would just get out of my system, I wish I'd never had them, wish they would never come back. 

00:32:30
LEN SPERRY Okay, and didn't you mention demons? 

00:32:30
2-15 

00:32:30
KATHLEEN Um. 

00:32:30
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Describe that? 

00:32:35
KATHLEEN Not really demons, but it was just, uh, a very, like when you go on, uh, like a scary ride or anything like that you just get scared, and that's how I felt. 

00:32:45
LEN SPERRY Mkay. 

00:32:45
KATHLEEN I felt like that. 

00:32:45
LEN SPERRY Have you ever had anything like that in your life before? 

00:32:50
KATHLEEN No. No, that's just the first time it's ever happened. 

00:32:50
LEN SPERRY Well you had mentioned, uh, something to similar to, like when you're going on a ride, uh, anything quite that intense? 

00:33:05
KATHLEEN Mm, No. Not really, it's just, you know I just get scared and it just, like I said, you just want them to go away, never come back, but they just do when, um, when I get all stressed out. 

00:33:20
LEN SPERRY Okay. Do you know anybody else who's had anything like that? 

00:33:20
KATHLEEN Um, not really, no, it's just, this is, uh, I'm the, um, I take that back, I do have, uh, a cousin who has panic attacks, but I've never seen him hav'em. 

00:33:30
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:33:30
2-16 

00:33:30
KATHLEEN I was told. But, um, no I'm the first one in the family, that's ever had anything like that. 

00:33:35
LEN SPERRY All right. And so your parents were pre, were pretty, uh, healthy? 

00:33:45
KATHLEEN Yeah they were fine, until their, their deaths and everything like that and fine, nobody. 

00:33:50
LEN SPERRY An, and their, but their deaths were really a surprise? 

00:33:55
KATHLEEN Um, Yes both of them were cancer. Yeah, so they, it was hard. 

00:34:00
LEN SPERRY Did you have, uh, any particular kind of reaction, around the time of their deaths? 

00:34:10
2-17 

00:34:10
KATHLEEN Oh, I remember when, um, um, they operated on my dad the second time, and they found the cancer, and the doctor did not come into the room, and he told my mother on the phone, in, in, In his room saying that he had cancer of the, in between the liver and pancreas and it was an inoperable and all. And when my mother told me, I just screamed and I said, "I hate god, I just hate him!" And my mother brought me to the side and she said, "Don't you ever do that!" You know I was just, eh, it's just mad, you just get mad, anything that's, just comes out of your mouth, and the same thing when my mother was ill, my aunt would bring her to the doctor and I'd be talking to her on the phone. But it would just be going in one ear and out the other, you just didn't want to hear it, it was just no I don't wanna hear about it, at all. 

00:35:00
LEN SPERRY So you didn't want to hear it? 

00:35:05
KATHLEEN No. 

00:35:05
LEN SPERRY Um, there's was one thing, but the other, you were also very angry. 

00:35:05
2-18 

00:35:05
KATHLEEN Mhm. Yeah, I was very angry because, I wish I could go back a few times and say like where I, important papers that I need, um, you know just have a talk with them. But, uh, that's, the first thing I get [ph] up down to say, to dad, "Why?" You know, why, why'd you take him? But I look now, I think that god did not want me, or my parents, I take that back, did not want me to, um, watch them suffer, or to have to take care of them, you know if they got worse. So I think that they left me, when they were just beginning to get sick, and didn't want me to take care of them. Uh, it hurts, but in the other, other sense I think it was much better. 

00:35:55
LEN SPERRY Okay, So there, it could've been worse? 

00:35:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Right, right. 

00:36:00
LEN SPERRY For them and for you. 

00:36:00
KATHLEEN Mm-hm. Correct. 

00:36:00
LEN SPERRY How do, what do you suppose is the reason why you, you've had these, uh, attacks? 

00:36:05
KATHLEEN Like I really wish I could answer that question. I don't know. I don't know at all. 

00:36:15
KATHLEEN And I know you're not a doctor. 

00:36:15
KATHLEEN No. 

00:36:15
2-19 

00:36:20
LEN SPERRY Uh, Well I also know that, uh, that most people try to make sense of things that happen in their life and they think about, the different kinds of explanations and, and, uh, sometimes those, those, uh, those explanations help them, uh, to, to sort things out and to, to sort of put things to, to rest. What kind of thoughts have you had about, uh, that? 

00:36:50
KATHLEEN What like with my parents or? 

00:36:55
LEN SPERRY Specifically how these, these attacks you've had, back starting in May, in 92. 

00:37:00
KATHLEEN I just wish they would leave me, and just leave me alone. I just, sometimes I look at some friends and you know they're all healthy and all, and I say to myself, "Why can't I be like them?" You know, no illness's or nothing, but they could probably have some illness's that they've never said to me. 

00:37:15
LEN SPERRY Well you said the, that you wish they would leave, they being? 

00:37:20
2-20 

00:37:20
KATHLEEN Meaning the, either the panic attacks or the epilepsy. I just wish I never had anything. I mean I don't mind having the occasional cold here and there, but, um, I just wish I could get rid of the attacks. 

00:37:35
LEN SPERRY Okay. Well and before you said you'd really, you'd be satisfied if you just had an ex, if you just had, uh, explanation, that would say, "This is just panic or it's both or it's just epilepsy." Then you said your life would be? 

00:37:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Occasional cold. I'd be fine, I'd be happy. 

00:37:55
LEN SPERRY Okay. So is that two different things you wanted? One instances you're, you're willing to just settle for an answer in the other you say you want it to go away. 

00:38:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Um, Well see I just wish. Well I would like it to just lead a normal life, have no illness's, no nothing. 

00:38:10
LEN SPERRY Okay. You know anybody who leads that kind of life? 

00:38:15
KATHLEEN Hmph. No. I mean I know a lot of people are, they have, you know, illness's and backaches an this that and the other, but, uh, nobody's perfect. 

00:38:25
LEN SPERRY Well what about yourself? 

00:38:30
KATHLEEN Nope. I'm not [ph] perfect. 

00:38:30
LEN SPERRY Well so, then, then, uh, you'd expect you wouldn't have perfect health then? 

00:38:30
2-21 

00:38:35
KATHLEEN No, but, I mean, I just wish that I never came across having these. 

00:38:40
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:38:40
KATHLEEN But, somebody must've wanted me to have them. 

00:38:40
LEN SPERRY Uh-huh. Mm Somebody! 

00:38:45
KATHLEEN Somebody, I don't know who, but, um, they chose me. 

00:38:50
LEN SPERRY Mm-hmm. You mean sort of like a spell? 

00:38:55
KATHLEEN Well not a spell, but, um, I've seen people that have gone into my neurologists office and I mean, there worse off than me. I mean there was like a little boy that was in a, uh, wheelchair, and I mean I said to myself, "My god that could be me, that could've been me." I could've been, uh, in a wheelchair, couldn't walk or talk, or not drive or anything and walk or, um, you know my head could be in a brace or something like that or." I'm lucky, I'm lucky I could, you know, hold a job, walk, you know go to, um, concerts. You know, uh, lead a normal life. So. 

00:39:35
LEN SPERRY All right. So maybe things aren't so bad after all? 

00:39:35
2-22 

00:39:40
KATHLEEN Nope, there not, there not. 

00:39:40
LEN SPERRY What's your whole hope, about the next six months, what are you expecting out of it? 

00:39:50
KATHLEEN Oh, hopefully to get out of our house, moved into a new bigger home, or apartment or whatever, and hopefully we'll start having a family, and just be happy as pie. 

00:40:05
LEN SPERRY Well how does the ideal of a, of starting a family, how's that for you? 

00:40:10
KATHLEEN Sounds good, I'd like to. 

00:40:15
LEN SPERRY Any, any reservations about it? 

00:40:15
2-23 

00:40:15
KATHEEN No. Cuz I don't want, I was the only child and I didn't like it. I'd like to, um, have at least two children if possible. So at least they have somebody to hang on to and I just don't want it to be my husband and myself when we get old. I'd like to have grandchildren and all, something I'd look forward to. 

00:40:40
LEN SPERRY Okay. When, when you say that, "The changed." Your eyes shifted one direction and then the other. You didn't know that, that happened? 

00:40:55
KATHLEEN No. 

00:41:00
LEN SPERRY It's almost as if your words said one thing and, and your body was saying something else. 

00:41:05
KATHLEEN No, I didn't know that. 

00:41:05
LEN SPERRY Yeah. 

00:41:10
KATHLEEN No, but I'm looking forward to, um, you know, getting everything together. 

00:41:15
LEN SPERRY Well sometimes people can be looking forward to something, a lot, um, but still have misgivings. 

00:41:20
KATHLEEN Right. 

00:41:20
LEN SPERRY Do you think sometimes you may be that way? 

00:41:25
2-24 

00:41:25
KATHLEEN No, no I don't have any misgivings, I just want to have a nice life with my husband, raise, raise a nice family and, um, just get on with, with life, be nice and happy. Have occasional, you know, you know, problems in the family, everybody will have problems like that, and just grow old together. So that's what I think. 

00:41:55
LEN SPERRY All right, what's the likelihood that, that's going to happen? 

00:42:00
KATHLEEN I think it will. I think it will happen. 

00:42:00
LEN SPERRY All right, even with, with all these, uh, uncertain medical concerns? 

00:42:05
KATHLEEN I think it will, or I really want to get down to it, to figure out what the heck is wrong with me. 

00:42:10
LEN SPERRY Okay. There, there's gonna be three possible, uh, answers. The one is, is that it's something very well defined, which may or may not be treatable. 

00:42:25
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

00:42:25
2-25 

00:42:25
LEN SPERRY Another, uh, possibility is, a second possibility is that there really isn't anything at all that's, that, medical test can pick up, at least at this stage of, uh, of the development of, uh, the condition. And the third is, is that it might be something that's, uh, can, can be diagnosable, but at which, at which attitudes and, and, certain, uh, beliefs that you have may, maybe, uh, making it an exacerbating, making it worse. If, uh, if you could get that answer tonight, uh, and be absolutely, um, certain that, that was the exact, uh, diagnosis, and there wasn't anything else and it was going to be one of those three, which of those three could you, would you be fine, easiest to live with? Which would you find most difficult to live with? 

00:43:35
2-26 

00:43:40
KATHLEEN I, I would just want to be happy, just be very happy. 

00:43:50
LEN SPERRY But you only have those three choices. 

00:43:50
KATHLEEN Yeah, Um, I couldn't answer you right now, I don't know. 

00:44:00
LEN SPERRY You don't? 

00:44:00
KATHLEEN No, not right now. 

00:44:05
LEN SPERRY What's keeping it from knowing right now? How are you keeping yourself from knowing that? 

00:44:10
KATHLEEN I, couldn't answer that, I really don't know off-hand. 

00:44:20
LEN SPERRY Okay, well let's say you don't know off-hand, what, what inklings do you have? 

00:44:25
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Right. Like of? 

00:44:25
LEN SPERRY Oh what, what, which of those three would be the most difficult for you to accept? And just based on what, which you know about yourself, as a person and how your life has gone. 

00:44:40
2-27 

00:44:45
KATHLEEN I, I really don't know off-hand. 

00:44:45
LEN SPERRY Okay. Let me ask you something else, could you, um, um, demonstrate what that, that, uh, that tightness was like, you know without describing, can you show me, in your body, what it was like? Show Me. 

00:45:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh, um, what it would be, it would come up my leg, it'd be real tight. 

00:45:15
LEN SPERRY Without words. 

00:45:15
KATHLEEN Okay. Come up here, up to my there. 

00:45:20
LEN SPERRY You can't use words. 

00:45:20
KATHLEEN Up here. Real tight. Go across. Down and down an up an tight. 

00:45:30
LEN SPERRY So, if I was to come in to, the, the, the room with your husband that, that day, and how would I see you? 

00:45:40
2-28 

00:45:40
KATHLEEN Um, you'd probably be sitting up against the couch on the floor, and I would have a hold of both of his hands. Cuz at that time I was afraid if somebody would let go of my hands that I was gonna, like fall, or anything like that. I mean I was on the floor, but still I had to hold onto somebodies hands, or if they just even tried to, you know let go a little bit to get blood back in their fingers, I would feel like I was falling. 

00:46:10
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Right. Okay, and if you fell what's the worst thing that could happen to you? 

00:46:15
2-29 

00:46:15
KATHLEEN Well, I'd fall, I'd fall, get back up. But I never did, I, I fell quite a few times; I mean I fell in the shower two times. But, um, I feel them coming on, and what, what I do is get on the floor and then when I, accident, when I, usually go into them, like this one time I, I fell and then the next thing I went to go like this and, I rug burned my whole nose. 

00:46:45
LEN SPERRY Mm-hmm 

00:46:50
KATHLEEN So. 

00:46:50
LEN SPERRY What's the worst thing that could happen to you? 

00:46:55
KATHLEEN Well, I couldn't die, from these. Um, My. 

00:47:00
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)You're, you're sure of that? 

00:47:00
KATHLEEN Yeah. My husband always tells me, but I think it's in anger, that he says, "He would leave me." Cuz he's just tired of these, but I thinks it's just he says it because he's mad, because these keep coming on and on and on. But I just get these, I think when I'm all stressed out, when I have two or three different things on my mind, at the one time and I just get so stressed, that I just go into having the attacks. 

00:47:30
LEN SPERRY And you say he was very angry at you? 

00:47:35
KATHLEEN Yeah he gets mad, but then what he does, is he goes out to cool off, you know take a ride or whatever, and it doesn't bother me. But I get very. 

00:47:40
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)It doesn't bother you that he's angry at you? 

00:47:45
2-30 

00:47:45
KATHLEEN Well, I understand now, because we've been through it so many, so long. 

00:47:50
LEN SPERRY Mm-hmm. 

00:47:50
KATHLEEN So many years, that he just goes off, and just drives around and then he'll come back. Cuz he say, "I can't stay around here with you, cuz I know how I'll, you'll be in and everything." So, he comes back and then he's okay, he understands. 

00:48:10
LEN SPERRY Okay. What does he understand? 

00:48:10
KATHLEEN Well, I mean he understands that I'm going through these and he wants me to get, get better. He does! 

00:48:15
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:48:20
KATHLEEN Cuz he wants to, you know, both of us have children and carry on a good life. 

00:48:25
LEN SPERRY Okay. Have you, uh, had any, of, uh, couples counseling? 

00:48:35
KATHLEEN No, no, not at all. 

00:48:35
LEN SPERRY Okay so right now, you're, you're getting some, some, uh, counseling yourself? 

00:48:40
2-31 

00:48:40
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Yeah, and he's getting counseling himself, cuz he has not gotten over his grief from his parents. So he, um, he likes going to that too. 

00:48:50
LEN SPERRY Is it possible that there may be some issues, uh, with, with, the marriage relationship? 

00:48:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Marriage or something? I mean if we ever had to go to a marriage counselor, we'd go. But, um, you know, I mean, I don't think we wouldn't say no to it, we'd go. 

00:49:05
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:49:05
KATHLEEN And just see if it was that or if it was both of are, are, um, attack, uh, I mean my panic attacks and his, um, grief. 

00:49:15
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:49:20
KATHLEEN You know, just to see. I'd do that. I'd be game. 

00:49:25
LEN SPERRY What's the earliest experience you can remember as a child? 

00:49:35
KATHLEEN What do you mean? Anything? 

00:49:35
LEN SPERRY Yeah anything, sure, something that happened maybe once, just, just a single time. 

00:49:40
KATHLEEN That I got in trouble or just anything? 

00:49:45
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)No, the earliest thing you can remember. 

00:49:45
2-32 

00:49:45
KATHLEEN Earliest thing, hmm, I remember getting in trouble from my dad, my neighbor and I went across the street and both the fathers, uh, we were playing, like in a new home they were building, and they found our little tricycles at the corner, but no us and they'd, both the fathers went over and, oh boy, we got a whipping, going, coming home. 

00:50:15
LEN SPERRY Okay. How old were you? 

00:50:15
KATHLEEN Oh, about three. 

00:50:20
LEN SPERRY Okay, so this was another little girl and another? 

00:50:20
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)My next door neighbor. 

00:50:25
LEN SPERRY Little girl? 

00:50:25
KATHLEEN Yes. 

00:50:25
LEN SPERRY All right, she was about the same age? 

00:50:25
KATHLEEN She was a year younger. 

00:50:25
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

00:50:25
KATHLEEN I was about four and she was about three so, you know. 

00:50:30
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)All right. All right, and who's ideal was it? 

00:50:35
KATHLEEN Uh, well we got up to the corner and, I, are other neighbors were, across playing in there, we just kind of looked at each other and we said, "Okay, let's go for it." 

00:50:40
LEN SPERRY Okay, All right, right, right. Which part of that whole experience do you remember most physically? 

00:50:50
KATHLEEN The spanking. 

00:50:50
2-33 

00:50:50
LEN SPERRY Okay, so how, what's, tell me about how that, that came about? 

00:50:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)That hurt. 

00:50:55
LEN SPERRY Were you standing up or sitting? 

00:50:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh yes, standing up, because my, my dad, both the dads had to carry the bikes back and us, and, and hitting us and telling us not to go over there anymore, so. 

00:51:05
LEN SPERRY Okay, you remember that pretty, pretty good? 

00:51:10
KATHLEEN cross-talk]Not really that one, there was another time that I went into a swimming pool and this, in a neighbor's house two doors down, I kept asking my mom, "Mom I'm going swimming?" "No you're not, no you're now!" I said, "I'm going swimming!" So I go out, went into the pool and I mean we were up to our chins, with the water, and, um, my, my dad found out that I was in the pool and so did the other neighbor , it was the same girl, oh my, we got hit, coming out of the pool. 

00:51:40
LEN SPERRY Okay. And what part of that do you remember most? 

00:51:40
KATHLEEN Um, that the water was up to my chin and I could barely breath. 

00:51:45
2-34 

00:51:45
LEN SPERRY All right, and what was, what was your, uh, your feeling, just as, as your, the water was up to here and. 

00:51:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Nothing, my neighbor was saying, "Are you supposed to be in that pool?" And I said, "No." 

00:52:00
LEN SPERRY Okay, So, the waters up here, and, and, and you remember that, tell what, what do you remember about that? 

00:52:10
KATHLEEN Oh just being in the pool and having fun. 

00:52:10
LEN SPERRY And how were you feeling? 

00:52:10
KATHLEEN Fine, I was feeling fine. 

00:52:15
LEN SPERRY Was it an adventure, was it, was it scary, was it? 

00:52:15
KATHLEEN No it wasn't scary, no it was fun. 

00:52:20
LEN SPERRY All right. 

00:52:20
KATHLEEN Cuz I like to swim. 

00:52:20
LEN SPERRY All right. You said you were wondering, you were concerned whether you were going to be able to breath like that? 

00:52:30
KATHLEEN Well, a little bit, cuz I mean I was on my tippy toes and all the way up to here, so, cuz it was a four foot pool, and I was under that, under that height. 

00:52:40
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Okay, okay, sure. And how old were you at the time? 

00:52:40
KATHLEEN Um, four. 

00:52:40
LEN SPERRY Okay, well you did some pretty daring things. 

00:52:45
KATHLEEN Oh, yes. 

00:52:45
LEN SPERRY As a, as a child. Sounds like you were kind of independent too. 

00:52:50
KATHLEEN Uh, yes and no. But I. 

00:52:50
2-35 

00:52:50
LEN SPERRY Well, how would the but to no part, how we weren't you? 

00:52:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Um, well the no thing, um, this was really stupid, how I, I look back at it, um, my parents they used to go to my neighbors houses, you know, like they trade and just go for a night, like on a Saturday, and I could not go to sleep until my mother was in the house and I could see if they went out, out, to like far away, and then, you know, waiting for them to come back. But they were either, either, one, two, or four houses down, I could not fall asleep until she got in the house, and I could never understand that till this day. 

00:53:30
LEN SPERRY Okay, and what's your understanding? 

00:53:30
2-36 

00:53:30
KATHLEEN Well now I look, thinking that it was just I had to have her in the house, like the, um, the, um, how can I, can't even think of a word, that she just had to be in there, the protectiveness. That she had to be in the house before I went to sleep, and she wouldn't fall asleep until I went an, when I used to go out to, and then she wouldn't fall asleep till I got home. 

00:53:55
LEN SPERRY And somehow she understood that and excepted that and, and your life went on and her life went on? 

00:54:05
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:10
LEN SPERRY If, put your, uh, husband in, in your mothers place, would, would he have understood that, would he have? 

00:54:15
KATHLEEN Yes he would, he'd understand. 

00:54:20
LEN SPERRY He wouldn't , he wouldn't have gotten mad at you? 

00:54:20
KATHLEEN No, see I was always afraid when I was growing up, that when I would get married, I'd be afraid, say my husband would go off for the night, that I would not be able to fall asleep till he got home. It's the other way around, I could fall asleep, and then he would come in, but, we had made a pack I said, "Look, if you spend the night at a friend's house, call, let me know." Cuz if he doesn't he hears from me, I let him know. 

00:54:50
LEN SPERRY How do you let him know? 

00:54:50
2-37 

00:54:50
KATHLEEN Oh give him a few nice words. I'll, I'll have an argument with him, and he says, "Okay, yeah I know I'm dumb, I know I did a dumb thing." But, um, we've got a good understanding, a good friendship relationship marriage. 

00:55:10
LEN SPERRY Okay, who are you most like, your mother or your father? 

00:55:10
KATHLEEN I'm a bit of my dad, I, I have a lot of my dad, I'm not, I, I don't have patience, and I do have my mom. So more like my dad, but I have my mom too. 

00:55:25
LEN SPERRY Okay, and I, there's just one of you, did one of them, um, sort of, uh, spoil you a little bit more than the other? 

00:55:35
2-38 

00:55:35
KATHLEEN My dad, oh god my dad, I always went a lot of places with him, like just to the store, um, you know, he'd say, "Let's go to the store." "Ok." Get in the car and go with him, but I was closer to mom in a different way. But when my dad did die, it just, it hit, I don't know, because if it was a first person very close to me that died or what. To this day, I don't know that answer but I think that's what it is. 

00:56:05
LEN SPERRY Yeah. Makes sense. 

00:56:05
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

00:56:05
2-39 

00:56:05
LEN SPERRY Makes sense. You know, the, while you describe things is not much different at all from other people that have been very, uh, concerned about, about the kind of symptoms you describe, and often times they tell similar kinds of early life experiences as you've described, and almost always there's a sense where they're doing one of two things; they're either holding on really tight, uh, to themselves or feeling that their breath is holding them, in, very, very tight. And do you want to know what tends to happen with those individuals? After a period of time, something very interesting happens, and they wouldn't have predicted it, uh, other people they'd know never would've guessed that it would've happened, but it happens. You know what it is? 

00:57:25
KATHLEEN No. 

00:57:25
LEN SPERRY All of a sudden out of the clear blue, that sense of tightness starts easing up, it tightens up a little bit, eases up a little bit and then it's, it's gone 

00:57:50
KATHLEEN That's very good. 

00:57:50
2-40 

00:57:50
2-41 

00:57:55
LEN SPERRY And that means then, that the breathing kind of starts back that normal rhythm again. So breath is something that, uh, we don't have to even think about it's, there's an automaticity to it, it's, it, it just happens, it's like your, your heart, uh, and when, when the breathing comes back it's as if what were, what were concerns and what were problems to them they may still be there. But they don't seem to be quite the same, there's a little bit different coloring to them, the texture, of, uh, of those concerns is a little bit different and many of the things in their life's that were going well before, continue to go well and some of the other things in their life's that weren't going quite so well, they start being less of a problem. Now that, that doesn't mean that they're perfect anymore and that, that everything has gone away, but there's not quite that, that, that sense of, of, uh, impending, uh, concern. And do you know why I'm, why I'm thinking that's gonna happen? 

00:59:30
KATHLEEN No. 

00:59:30
LEN SPERRY The, the story you told, about, about the, uh, bicycles and the new house and about, uh, the swimming pool, both those, those situations in the short run didn't seem, uh, like they were absolutely happy endings but your life went on after that. 

01:00:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah it did. 

01:00:00
2-42 

01:00:00
LEN SPERRY And it was, there, it was, uh, little point in time, seconds maybe a couple of minutes, and, and you got past, this, this, the spanking that came from, the person who you're probably the closest in your life. 

01:00:15
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. They were just trying to teach us, not to do wrong 

01:00:20
LEN SPERRY Yeah. Well and they may have been trying to teach you something else too. 

01:00:25
KATHLEEN True. 

01:00:25
LEN SPERRY Probably even more so, and then it's, uh, how, how to stay alive, to stay healthy. I think that's what, what, uh, the lesson was in both those stories. 

01:00:40
KATHLEEN I think so too. 

01:00:40
LEN SPERRY And, uh, that's a legacy, that your parents gave to you. 

01:00:45
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:00:45
2-43 

01:00:45
LEN SPERRY You always have those memories. Things weren't going well for a while, they were very exciting up until that time when you were, you were roaming around the house and in the pool, and then this little, uh, reality, bit of reality comes in. 

01:01:05
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:01:05
LEN SPERRY But nothing, nothing really bad happens, you don't die, you don't, uh, lose privileges and, and get grounded for, uh, 10 years, but, there out of that, that experience something, uh, good came, your relationship was restored with your father, I'm sure he loved you as much as he did. 

01:01:30
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh god Yeah! Yes he did. 

01:01:35
LEN SPERRY And, uh, I'm wondering if, if, uh, that pattern, little pattern may, may repeat itself, just every so, occasionally in your life, in, in little mini fashion, in little miniature fashion. 

01:01:50
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)It might, I think it does. Yeah cuz I miss my dad a lot and that, you know like I said, with certain things, I do miss him. Wish they were here, like when we have children and I would miss. 

01:02:00
2-44 

01:02:00
LEN SPERRY And, and here's what I want to suggest to Kathleen, that one of the ways that you've been able to keep that fond memory of your father alive, happens in your relationship with your husband. 

01:02:15
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm, right. 

01:02:20
Okay, so you two mix it up a little bit, uh, what does it, what, what, ends up coming out of that? He shows you who, you're still together. 

01:02:30
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:02:30
LEN SPERRY You've got a life plan, it's maybe a little bit here and there. 

01:02:35
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Here and there. 

01:02:35
LEN SPERRY Yeah. And the future may not be absolutely clear an you'd like to have this, the, the children and grow old together and have little grandchildren's. But, Mm, you never know exactly how every stuff will be. 

01:02:50
KATHLEEN We're just gonna have to go day by day. 

01:02:50
2-45 

01:02:50
LEN SPERRY Yeah, right. And, and you have a unique way of remembering your father, and, an, an I think that the important part of this whole thing is, the experience you have of feeling, uh, energized and so alive. I think it's happening in both instances. 

01:03:15
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:03:15
LEN SPERRY When you were a little girl and, and you wouldn't have to take me out, there's a sense of aliveness that's, that there, because it's not like, the rest of your everyday life experiences. And, well you're in a very interesting, interesting situation and the thing that's interesting about it, is what would happen if you, if you change that little pattern you have with, with, uh, with your husband? Is it, will you forget about your father, will he still have that, um, have that, that place in, in your life and in your heart? 

01:04:00
KATHLEEN Well he'll always. 

01:04:00
LEN SPERRY I think he will. 

01:04:00
KATHLEEN He will! 

01:04:00
2-46 

01:04:00
2-47 

01:04:00
LEN SPERRY All right, and you know what maybe, that at some point in time, just like I said, that, that just sort of goes away, that kind of inner sense that something isn't right. I think that same sense can go away too, and that, uh, you won't need to quite remember your father through these, these, uh, experience of these bodily, uh, tightening's and, an, and, uh, and symptom's and you'll still be able to, to love him, cherish him, remember him, and it will mean your life is going to go on and your husbands, your life with him is going to go on. So that's what I think might happen. But, you know what, everything is, it might take a different path through, but you're gonna be the one that will know that. 

01:05:10
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm, yeah. 

01:05:15
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:05:15
KATHLEEN That's right. 

01:05:15
LEN SPERRY All right. We need to stop. 

01:05:20
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. Mkay. Well, thank you very much. 

01:05:20
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)I'm glad we had this chance to talk. 

01:05:20
KATHLEEN Thank you very much, [ph] doctor 

01:05:25
JON CARLSON Kathleen seemed like, really a challenging client, is this a good example of your approach to brief therapy Len? 

01:05:30
3-1 

01:05:35
LEN SPERRY Yes it is, Kathleen is, is a challenging client and I, I do see a number of persons like her and I think that's one of the reasons why this Bio Cycle Social approach, as, has some value and, and I think it's going to have, uh, some impact, on, on clients that tend to be more challenging, more difficult, and more [ph]aft confusing, the very presentation is confusing, diagnoses. 

01:06:00
JON CARLSON Well most of us have been trained in mental health, we've been trained a lot in the psychological and the social dimensions, but this one has a pretty strong overlay for the biological. When you formulated this case, can you talk about how those three relate together? 

01:06:15
3-2 

01:06:15
Len Sperry, M.D., Ph.D. 

01:06:15
LEN SPERRY Well the biological is the substrate or it's, uh, the, the, the actual base on which the cycle social, uh, relate and connect. She came to her, to this, uh, particular session with the same concerns, that I think she's taken to her neurologist, the other physicians she's working, to the psychiatrist she's now working with and a counselor. And that is, presenting with, uh, with what appeared to be biological symptoms and she claims, and that's her formulation, that she has a medical problem and the question is somebody is gonna have to come up with the exact diagnosis. 

01:06:55
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Right. 

01:06:55
3-3 

01:07:00
LEN SPERRY Well, her medical, uh, related type symptoms, she describes having seizure like behavior, they're atypical kind of seizure presentations, are clearly related to other aspects of her life, the social dynamics in her life and her own psychodynamics. So in this particular instance I think we're seeing that a presentation that appears to be biological shouldn't necessarily make the mental health counselor, who isn't trained in, in medicine or one of the allied health professions, feel like they can't deal with, with a client like this. I think it's a question of, of trying to understand the person in their whole realm, biologically, psychosocially, and how those, uh, three relate to each other. 

01:07:50
Jon Carlson, Psy. D., Ed. D., ABPP 

01:07:50
JON CARLSON Let's watch how you work, let's watch some clips from the video right now, and one of the first clips we're gonna watch is, when you start to ask some questions and it's important I guess in, when you work with people with health related issues that you can distinguish, which part is psychological and which part is, is the biological. Let's watch a clip here and see how you do that. 

01:08:15
LEN SPERRY Okay. If you could do that, how would your life be different? 

01:08:20
3-4 

01:08:20
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Yes. Oh, much better, much better. I wouldn't like, have to worry about anything or, I mean I know people worry about things, but I would feel more at ease with life. Um, you know with being married and everything, you know I have to think of, uh, really um, if we want to have children, my husband and I, I have to get off medication first or see if I'm well enough to have children. So that kind of is, uh, not worrisome, but it's on, it's on my, it's on both of our minds. 

01:08:55
JON CARLSON Was her answer to this question helpful Len, in creating a differential diagnosis, and which part is biological and which part is psychological? 

01:09:05
3-5 

01:09:05
LEN SPERRY It certainly set the stage for me to be, to be strategizing how I would proceed. It's interesting she could have listed those four, five items that were concern to her, in, in a, in a different order with the biological ones on top, stopping the medication, having a child. But what, what did she do, she started with the relationship issues and I, for me I was thinking right there, well we need a bio, or, or more detailed and more focused kind of biological, uh, set of questions that I need to ask. To rule that out and then I'm going to focus on more the, uh, psychosocial, particularly the relational issues. 

01:09:50
JON CARLSON In this next clip we're gonna watch, we begin to see her really having paradoxical, or at least, there's some real conflictial kinds of answers. I mean she went through, in the piece we're gonna watch, she's giving you body language, that gives you one answer and words that give you another answer, and I, I watched this, as she did this, you let this go through, you didn't confront her, I think she shook her head no as she said yes, and you, should you let things like that go? 

01:10:15
3-6 

01:10:20
LEN SPERRY Yes in this instances, uh, my sense was to, to pursue that would, would probably rupture this, the, the sense of, uh, joining, I had, engagement is, is not yet been achieved at this, at this juncture yet, and I'm working toward that. It would have been, it would have, uh, been a [ph] pared victory for me to, to pursue that. It would have been, another way of looking at it, it would have been a, uh, therapeutic error of, uh, high magnitude. 

01:10:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Set you back, yeah. 

01:10:55
JON CARLSON So you'd win the battle and lose the war? 

01:10:55
LEN SPERRY Yes. 

01:10:55
JON CARLSON Let's watch this, clip. 

01:11:00
LEN SPERRY Did, uh, reception with 200 people, could've had, uh, panic attacks, you could've at, with 40 people. 

01:11:05
KATHLEEN Right, but I was fine that day. 

01:11:10
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:11:10
KATHLEEN I was fine. 

01:11:10
LEN SPERRY What do you think accounts for that? 

01:11:15
KATHLEEN I don't know, I really don't, I mean I think I was, see if I don't think about it, I don't get them. So I probably had a lot on my mind, where I said ok, you know they just, didn't even appear that day, and then that day we had our outside party, nothing. 

01:11:35
LEN SPERRY Mk. 

01:11:35
3-7 

01:11:35
KATHLEEN Nothing happened that day cuz I was to be busy running around making sure everything was in its, uh, place and all, I was fine. 

01:11:40
LEN SPERRY Was that sort of rule for you, that you'd noticed them if you're, um, if you're preoccupied, if you're that, [ph]things that need to get done then , then it, it, that day it isn't a problem? 

01:11:55
KATHLEEN Right, if I. 

01:11:55
JON CARLSON As I watch this clip, I'm just impressed with, her emotions and aphect or really lack thereof, was that useful for you, information to? 

01:12:05
3-8 

01:12:05
LEN SPERRY And very useful information, and just because she didn't present with a full blown seizure history doesn't mean that the biological dimension is not operative here. What often happens, in individuals that have a difficult time showing emotions, is that they have a difficult time doing it or it's almost impossible. There's a term for this that's called alexithymia, and that word means, uh, without feelings, words without feelings. We often see this, kind of presentation is difficulty expressing emotions, even understanding, even being able to label them, uh, in, in what's called a somatizing client. 

01:13:00
JON CARLSON Somatizing that's, soma means bodies, so this would be, they would hold the feelings in the body? 

01:13:05
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Somatize. Well, rather than expressing, uh, conflict, rather than in a way of, uh, of manifesting, uh, uh, internal sensations, of, of fear, those get channeled immediately into organ symptoms. 

01:13:25
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Physical. 

01:13:25
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)So they [ph]express it inwardly rather than outward like? 

01:13:30
LEN SPERRY Yeah, they, they should, they express it, uh, medically rather than, uh, in feelings terms rather than psychologically. 

01:13:35
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

01:13:35
3-9 

01:13:35
DIANE KJOS Cuz she's almost shut down looking, you know there's, you just, I'm not [ph] paying anu, I'm not here, kind of sense or, you know, it's like, "Can I get your attention please?" Almost, yeah, yeah. 

01:13:45
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Yes, yes. And it, and it's a real disadvantage and for someone like Kathleen, one of the ways she, one of the very few ways she has to, to make contact with other people, to get their attention, to communicate to them is to do it with these, with these medical symptoms, and it's, if she could have another option, which is an option most other people have, that are not somatizers, her life would be very, very different. But really she only, she's a one channel person when it comes to communicating. 

01:14:25
JON CARLSON Well in this next piece, you ask her about feelings and her feelings, let's watch what she says or does. 

01:14:30
KATHLEEN But I couldn't go in. 

01:14:30
3-10 

01:14:35
LEN SPERRY So what were you feeling? Cuz you were, these were what, like some, some, uh, sharp pains? 

01:14:40
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh god I didn't know what. Demons (inaudible ). Not sharp pains, no it was just, like really, really tight. 

01:14:45
LEN SPERRY Tightness? 

01:14:45
KATHLEEN Yeah, coming all the way up and going down, and then it would start all, over again, and I mean I had it like, three, four hours. 

01:14:55
LEN SPERRY So this, these were shooting sensation? 

01:14:55
KATHLEEN Uh, No, just real tight. 

01:14:55
JON SPERRY Tight, tightness. 

01:15:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Tight. Mm-hmm. 

01:15:00
LEN SPERRY And what about other, other things you noticed? 

01:15:00
KATHLEEN Um, Really those are the only kinds of experiences I get. 

01:15:05
LEN SPERRY All right, did you remember anything else, uh, at, at that first time, (inaudible ) does your breathing change? 

01:15:15
KATHLEEN Yes. My heart gets really, goes really fast, and then, um, I would stop breathing, like I'd get scared. 

01:15:20
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)All right. 

01:15:20
KATHLEEN And I. 

01:15:25
LEN SPERRY And hold your breath. 

01:15:25
KATHLEEN And then what I was told, you know, "Breath, breath, you know continue breathing, but slowly, now pace your breathing." 

01:15:30
3-11 

01:15:35
JON CARLSON What do you, learning about Kathleen during this part of the [ph]interview, and her response to your question about feelings? 

01:15:40
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)A lot! A lot! And I think she, she really laid it out there, she said, "This is the only thing I was experiencing, was these physical sensations." She, wasn't in touch with feelings, because she wasn't experiencing them. I learned that with her, for me to pursue more [ph]feeling oriented, uh, efforts to, to further, uh, um, assess her situation or to make interventions that would be directed in the, you know, in the [ph]affect channel, probably wouldn't work, they probably would be, uh, would just fall on deaf ears. 

01:16:25
DIANE KJOS She might say yes, or she might just go on to something else, or she might, just sort of look like, at you like, "What do you mean, I was frightened, what do you mean?" Like, yeah. 

01:16:35
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:16:35
3-12 

01:16:35
JON CARLSON In, in, in one hand it is appears like she's reading resistance, to, to, you and maybe your very direct, on the other hand, uh, isn't this the way she [ph] can grasp life? 

01:16:50
LEN SPERRY I think you're right on Jon, she is resistant if we're framing this as a good client only answers appropriately with, with [ph] aphex. But she doesn't have, that is a strong suit, at all, so she, she was telling me, "If you're going to understand me, understand my world and then we can communicate, then we can get, we can be engaged in, in, in treatment." 

01:17:20
JON CARLSON One of the things that impresses me about what you're doing, is you keep changing your approach to, the client. It's kind of like Arnie Lazareth, I think called being an authentic chameleon. 

01:17:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:17:30
3-13 

01:17:30
JON CARLSON And you're authentic in your approach and yet you keep having to modify, you're not using this one size fits all model with her, you don't just reflect, or you don't just confront, you have to really shift yourself. 

01:17:45
LEN SPERRY And that's the challenge. 

01:17:50
JON CARLSON Well in this next thing we see you shift further in this next piece, and what you shift from becoming a little bit more, you know confrontative, as you point out a contradiction within her. 

01:18:00
LEN SPERRY Yes. 

01:18:00
JON CARLSON And the way she talks and what she does so let's watch that. 

01:18:05
LEN SPERRY Different things you wanted, one instances you're, you're willing to just settle for an answer in the other you say you want it to go away. 

01:18:10
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Um, Well see I just wish. Well I would like it to just lead a normal life, have no illness's, no nothing. 

01:18:20
LEN SPERRY Okay. You know anybody who leads that kind of life? 

01:18:20
KATHLEEN Hmph. No. I mean I know a lot of people are, they have, you know, illness's and backaches an this that and the other, but, uh, nobody's perfect. 

01:18:35
LEN SPERRY Well what about yourself? 

01:18:35
KATHLEEN Nope. I'm not perfect. 

01:18:40
LEN SPERRY Well so, then, then, uh, you'd expect you wouldn't have perfect health then? 

01:18:40
3-14 

01:18:40
KATHLEEN No, but, I mean, I just wish that I never came across having these. 

01:18:45
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:18:45
KATHLEEN But, somebody must've wanted me to have them. 

01:18:50
LEN SPERRY Uh-huh. Mm Somebody! 

01:18:55
KATHLEEN Somebody, I don't know who, but, um, they chose me. 

01:19:00
JON CARLSON You're pretty gentle with her though, on this piece, you don't, you know, she, uh, you don't push it with her, you just seem to elicit this information and allow her to do what she's gonna do with it. 

01:19:10
3-15 

01:19:15
LEN SPERRY Yes. It may just be, Jon and Diane, that this is part of her style, which is to send out messages, uh, to others and see what happens, and I would suspect that's, uh, a singularly important part of her personality style and for me to be annoyed with that or to criticize it probably would, would, would further make the engagement process almost impossible. 

01:19:50
DIANE KJOS The, the, the thing that I hear though, is that she's really giving this thing power, in a sense that while she wants to be in control, it's somebody gave her this or some cosmic power determined and would you at some point challenge that in, in, in some way or, how would you? 

01:20:10
LEN SPERRY Very definitely! If I wouldn't do that in this, in the first meeting, and your, you picked up on something very important and there's something outside of her that's. 

01:20:20
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)First session. Controlling her. 

01:20:25
LEN SPERRY Yeah. 

01:20:25
DIANE KJOS She talked earlier about demons. 

01:20:25
3-16 

01:20:25
LEN SPERRY She sure did, and, and that would, would need to be followed up on, we would follow up on that differentially, I don't, uh, suspect that this is delusional. But often, uh, the somatic client will make these kinds of attributions because they're the only thing that makes sense to them. They can't have a, uh, feeling vocabulary to, uh, to, uh, uh, rely on and, and say, "Well this is because of, I'm feeling this way because of, of trauma or because of, uh, conflicts I had with, uh my father or someone else that was important to me." But what she can do, is say, "Well I'm, I'm having these symptoms, if the doctors can't find out what it is, if there's not some immediately diagnosable situation, then what are the other possible explanations?" Well one of them is, is that it may be uh, from some outside influence. So I will certainly come back to that, at this point though I'm, I think it would have disrupted the, uh, the flow of things. 

01:21:35
3-17 

01:21:35
JON CARLSON Well in this next piece, we're gonna give you some, you're gonna have some more opportunities not to be annoyed or not to be angered at her, as she won't answer your question in the way you want it answered. 

01:21:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Frustrating. 

01:21:50
JON CARLSON Let's watch this. 

01:21:50
LEN SPERRY There, there's gonna be three possible, uh, answers. The one is, is that it's something very well defined which may or may not be treatable. 

01:22:05
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:22:05
3-18 

01:22:05
LEN SPERRY Another, uh, possibility is, a second possibility is that there really isn't anything at all that's, that, medical test can pick up, at least at this stage of, uh, of the development of, uh, the condition. And the third is, is that it might be something that's, uh, can, can be diagnosable, but at which, at which attitudes and, and, certain, uh, beliefs that you have may, maybe, uh, making it an exacerbating, making it worse. If, uh, if you could get that answer tonight, uh, and be absolutely, um, certain that, that was the exact, uh, diagnosis, and there wasn't anything else and it was going to be one of those three, which of those three could you, would you be fine, easiest to live with? Which would you find most difficult to live with? 

01:23:20
KATHLEEN I, I would just want to be happy, just be very happy. 

01:23:30
LEN SPERRY But you only have those three choices. 

01:23:30
KATHLEEN Yeah, Um, I couldn't answer you right now, I don't know. 

01:23:40
LEN SPERRY You don't? 

01:23:40
KATHLEEN No, not right now. 

01:23:40
3-19 

01:23:45
LEN SPERRY What's keeping it from knowing right now? How are you keeping yourself from knowing that? 

01:23:50
KATHLEEN I, couldn't answer that, I really don't know off hand. 

01:24:00
LEN SPERRY Okay, well let's say you don't know off hand, what, what inklings do you have? 

01:24:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Right. Like of? 

01:24:05
LEN SPERRY Oh what, what, which of those three would be the most difficult for you to accept? And just based on what, which you know about yourself, as a person and how your life has gone. 

01:24:20
KATHLEEN I, I really don't know off hand. 

01:24:25
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:24:25
JON CARLSON Well what was going on with you when, when you gave her these three choices and, uh, she came up with at least two more with, "I want to be happy." Or "I don't know." 

01:24:35
LEN SPERRY Yes. Well, I of course would've, would've preferred her to (inaudible ) to, to answer the way I would like to have (inaudible ) uh-huh. 

01:24:48
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)I would've like to be, yeah. 

01:24:48
3-20 

01:24:48
LEN SPERRY But, but that's, that's not her, I, I think what she did was shut down, there was something probably about that first option that, that her mind started working over, processing, and I don't know that she heard the rest. 

01:25:05
DIANE KJOS Oh, cuz I saw her go, then she kind of, her eyes went up three times, I mean she, up and back, and up and I mean oh, and I was thinking she was picking those three and yeah I don't know. 

01:25:15
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Her eyes, yeah. 

01:25:15
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Yes, yes, she was. When she was trying to process, uh, those maybe, I don't know if it was parts of all three or if she was reflecting on, on, on that first one. 

01:25:25
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Oh, just reflecting. 

01:25:25
3-21 

01:25:25
LEN SPERRY But I wanted to, I wanted to push the limits on this and one of the reasons for doing this, is to see what kind of, uh, resources she has. It's not uncommon for individuals, particularly who, who, somatize, to, to, to confabulate, that is to come up with, uh, explanations that just are, don't' match what we understand, uh, the way a medical process, biological process works. But, she just wasn't even up to, to trying that, we, we're meaning makers and, as, as individuals and we all try to figure out what's happening in are life, but Kathleen here, was, I think really stumped and, uh, so I took that in and I, from a client focus point of view that was valuable information, so I didn't need to [ph]add my counter transference. 

01:26:30
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:26:30
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Your frustrations. 

01:26:35
LEN SPERRY I, I was trying to understand her and, and, uh, this was very valuable information. 

01:26:40
JON CARLSON Okay, counter transference would be, like dealing with a difficult teenager or dealing with some other resistant person? 

01:26:50
3-22 

01:26:50
LEN SPERRY Sure, and, and being either, uh, angry, confused, frightened, those are all kind of counter transference that one could have here. And that again, is probably her way of testing people and I didn't need to, I didn't need to get [ph] sucked into that. 

01:27:05
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Uh, [ph]sucked into that. 

01:27:10
LEN SPERRY No. 

01:27:10
JON CARLSON And what you did do though, is that you stopped, and then you tried on a different chameleon color here and you went on, you shifted gears and asked her to, uh, talk, to act out or to describe her symptoms or demonstrate her symptoms, I think your words were. Let's watch how she answers you. 

01:27:30
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)I shifted gears. Okay. 

01:27:35
LEN SPERRY Let me ask you something else, could you, um, um, demonstrate what that, that, uh, that tightness was like, you know without describing, can you show me, in your body, what it was like? Show me. 

01:27:50
3-23 

01:27:50
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh, sure, um, what it would be, it would come up my leg, it'd be real tight. 

01:28:00
LEN SPERRY Without words. 

01:28:00
KATHLEEN Okay. Come up here, up to my there. 

01:28:05
LEN SPERRY You can't use words. 

01:28:05
KATHLEEN Up here. Real tight. Go across. Down and down and up real tight. 

01:28:15
LEN SPERRY So, if I was to come in to, the, the, the room with your husband that, that day, and how would I see you? 

01:28:25
3-24 

01:28:25
KATHLEEN Um, you'd probably be sitting up against the couch on the floor, and I would have ahold of both of his hands. Cuz at that time I was afraid if somebody would let go of my hands that I was gonna, like fall, or anything like that. I mean I was on the floor, but still I had to hold onto somebodies hands, or if they just even tried to, you know let go a little bit to get blood back in their fingers, I would feel like I was falling. 

01:28:55
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Right. Okay, and if you fell what's the worst thing that could happen to you? 

01:29:00
KATHLEEN Well, I'd fall, I'd fall, get back up. > 

01:29:05
JON CARLSON What did you learn from this Len? Was it that she couldn't do this or she wouldn't do this? 

01:29:10
3-25 

01:29:15
LEN SPERRY The formulation that, that, that's been emerging as, uh, this, this, session went on, was that in addition to this somatizing style of presenting herself and seeing the world, there's a, there's a strong measures of power and control here. These are, are psychodynamics as well as system dynamics, and that was what I was getting some confirmation on. That she has to do it her way, or let's maybe it would be better to say she prefers to do it her way. She, she likes to follow her own drummer, an now she's, she's willing to cooperate to certain extent, but, uh, and I think this, this shows, she could've talked out loud all three times. But she, she muted her, her demonstration, so this is what I, this particular segment was telling me. 

01:30:10
JON CARLSON And then in this, this next piece, she shift to get an early recollection were you looking, hoping that it would be a Burger King, when she went there and got it her way? You know as we went through this and, uh, what were you looking for by these early recollections? 

01:30:25
LEN SPERRY What I wanted to do is for her to confirm and then also elaborate my formulation of what, what is happening. Now (inaudible ) 

01:30:37
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Was it selfish? It was to do, for your formulation or as well as to help her, uh, get inside or have meaning? 

01:30:40
3-26 

01:30:45
LEN SPERRY It's gonna be both. Now see she has a formulation of how her whole life and particularly these symptoms and these relationships all fit together, It's very difficult for her to explain these. She needs to, to, to think about them in a more systematic way and that's what I was, uh, attempting to, to, to help her understand, but for myself also to develop my own formulation of what would happen. Now the early recollections are a projective technique and they. 

01:31:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Like a Rorschach or like (inaudible ) 

01:31:26
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Very much so. 

01:31:26
JON CARLSON Okay 

01:31:26
LEN SPERRY Or a, uh, sentence completion test. The individual has to, uh add meaning, to, to a given situation, so I've the, the question and I'm filed off to see what her reaction was, what was most important to her, how she processed that, if there were feelings involved or sensations and then her thoughts. 

01:31:45
3-27 

01:31:45
DIANE KJOS Now is, having watched this "I don't know!" piece, I'm, as you're doing it, I'm thinking, she's going to say, "Well I really don't have any." There's, but, but you access it there, where you really did get something there and that's sort of like, you're going to keep trying one thing after another. 

01:32:00
LEN SPERRY One of the things that was, was very clear here, is though she can't get in touch with, with her feelings and aphecs, she can get in touch with, with images and sensations and those are very strong modalities for her and those modalities are important to know. Because those would be the way we would try to work therapeutically with her, if this, if this, uh, therapeutic relationship would continue. 

01:32:30
JON CARLSON Okay, well let's watch how you get early recollections from her. 

01:32:35
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:32:35
LEN SPERRY What's the earliest experience you can remember as a child? 

01:32:40
KATHLEEN What do you mean? Anything? 

01:32:45
LEN SPERRY Yeah anything, sure, something that happened maybe once, just, just a single time. 

01:32:50
KATHLEEN That I got in trouble or just anything? 

01:32:50
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)No, the earliest thing you can remember. 

01:32:55
3-28 

01:32:55
KATHLEEN Earliest thing, hmm. I remember getting in trouble from my dad, my neighbor and I went across the street and both the fathers, uh, we were playing, like in a new home they were building, and they found our little tricycles at the corner, but no us and they'd, both the fathers went over and, oh boy, we got a whipping, going, coming home. 

01:33:25
LEN SPERRY Okay. How old were you? 

01:33:25
KATHLEEN Oh, about three. 

01:33:25
LEN SPERRY Okay, so this was another little girl and another? 

01:33:30
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)My next door neighbor. 

01:33:30
LEN SPERRY Little girl? 

01:33:30
KATHLEEN Yes. 

01:33:35
LEN SPERRY All right, she was about the same age? 

01:33:35
KATHLEEN She was a year younger. 

01:33:35
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:33:35
KATHLEEN I was about four and she was about three so, you know. 

01:33:40
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)All right. All right, and who's ideal was it? 

01:33:40
KATHLEEN Uh, well we got up to the corner and, I, are other neighbors were, across playing in there, we just kind of looked at each other and we said, "Okay, let's go for it." 

01:33:50
LEN SPERRY Okay, All right, right, right. Which part of that whole experience do you remember most physically? 

01:33:55
KATHLEEN The spanking. 

01:33:55
3-29 

01:34:00
LEN SPERRY Okay, so how, what's, tell me about how that, that came about? 

01:34:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)That hurt. 

01:34:05
LEN SPERRY Were you standing up or sitting? 

01:34:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh yes, standing up, because my, my dad, both the dads had to carry the bikes back and us, and, and hitting us and telling us not to go over there anymore, so. 

01:34:15
LEN SPERRY Okay, you remember that pretty, pretty good? 

01:34:20
KATHLEEN cross-talk]Not really that one, there was another time that I went into a swimming pool and this, in a neighbor's house two doors down, I kept asking my mom, "Mom I'm going swimming?" "No you're not, no you're now!" I said, "I'm going swimming!" So I go out, went into the pool and I mean we were up to our chins, with the water, and, um, my, my dad found out that I was in the pool and so did the other neighbor , it was the same girl, oh my, we got hit, coming out of the pool. 

01:34:45
LEN SPERRY Okay. And what part of that do you remember most? 

01:34:50
KATHLEEN Um, that the water was up to my chin and I could barely breath. 

01:34:55
3-30 

01:34:55
LEN SPERRY All right, and what was, what was your, uh, your feeling, just as, as your, the water was up to here and. 

01:35:00
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Nothing, my neighbor was saying, "Are you supposed to be in that pool?" And I said, "No." 

01:35:10
LEN SPERRY Okay, So, the waters up here, and, and, and you remember that, tell what, what do you remember about that? 

01:35:15
KATHLEEN Oh just being in the pool and having fun. 

01:35:20
LEN SPERRY And how were you feeling? 

01:35:20
KATHLEEN Fine, I was feeling fine. 

01:35:25
LEN SPERRY Was it an adventure, was it, was it scary, was it? 

01:35:25
KATHLEEN No it wasn't scary, no it was fun. 

01:35:30
LEN SPERRY All right. 

01:35:30
KATHLEEN Cuz I like to swim. 

01:35:30
LEN SPERRY All right. You said you were wondering, you were concerned whether you were going to be able to breath like that? 

01:35:40
KATHLEEN Well, a little bit, cuz I mean I was on my tippy toes and all the way up to here, so, cuz it was a four foot pool, and I was under that, under that height. 

01:35:45
LEN SPERRY (crosstalk)Okay, okay, sure. And how old were you at the time? 

01:35:50
KATHLEEN Um, four. 

01:35:50
LEN SPERRY Okay, well you did some pretty daring things, As a , as a child. 

01:35:55
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh, yes. 

01:35:55
JON CARLSON So what does this mean, you know we've all got memories, why is this so important? 

01:36:00
3-31 

01:36:00
LEN SPERRY Well, she's constructing her past, in that, in a way that's, uh, makes sense, and is consistent with her life in the present. 

01:36:10
JON CARLSON You mean, this didn't really happen? 

01:36:15
LEN SPERRY Sure, the, the events happened, uh, what she's recalling of, of those two events, are the highlights, the features that, that make most sense to her, that fit her formulation of the way life is and what she is supposed to be today. 

01:36:30
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Today? So what, what did you get from that, what does it, uh, what does it tell you? 

01:36:35
3-32 

01:36:35
LEN SPERRY Well it told me a couple of things, the first thing is, it confirmed my, uh, therapeutic suspicion about the place of control, in having things her way, and the importance of, of, of, rearranging life and other peoples life so that she could feel secure. Remember she's an only child and, uh, and the second thing this showed me was that she is an adventurous person, that fear is, uh, is not something that's, that's not overwhelming her, as it might for many children who, who are in a pool that's, where the waters four foot deep. It's , it's an adventure for her, I'm wondering why now, uh, she isn't seeing her life as an adventure, but, but she's seeing it as a threat, she's seeing it as an enormous threat and she is expressing that, uh, that message with these, uh, somatic symptoms. 

01:37:45
3-33 

01:37:45
JON CARLSON You'd think the consequences were so clear for her though, when I, and when I'm adventuresome or when I do what I want to do, I get punished and, uh, I also disappoint my parents. Was, is that a reason may be why she is so tied up in herself? 

01:38:05
LEN SPERRY Well let's speak to the first part, I, I, I'm not sure that I would conclude that she was a disappointment to her parents, um, but, uh, with regard to the first part, yes. 

01:38:15
JON CARLSON I mean they punished her, dad got a big, you know, whipping. 

01:38:20
3-34 

01:38:20
LEN SPERRY Okay. But in, in many cultures and many ethnic, uh, uh, uh, styles of upbringing, punishment is one way that you show a child that you care for them and I'm not getting the impression from her, throughout any of this interview, that, that, that, that, uh, punishment was seen as something that, that, uh, was, was onerous or, or, or, uh, or, or traumatic for her. Actually, it was the exact opposite, it was a point of contact with her, it was one of the ways she could probably get, uh, her fathers undivided attention and that she could spend time with him alone and this I would guess is, is important to her. 

01:39:10
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)Something positive. There's almost a sense of triumph, "I really got a whipping!" You know like, it was like you know, "I really got a beautiful bike!" or a, "I really got a great prize!" And yeah. 

01:39:20
3-35 

01:39:25
LEN SPERRY On addition to the, the, uh, three channels we mentioned before, of, uh, the, uh, sematic, and the, uh, the, uh, imagional one, imaginary one, she's very good at images. I think the tactile or kinesthetic, which is, uh, related to the sematic, is an important channel for her. One of the ways, in which she was actually getting contact with her father, was through those, was through those spankings and again this hypothesis now, because we haven't really checked it out with her. But I suspect that, uh, she wasn't evaluating these as negative experiences, but more the way you were suggesting Diane. But these were, these, these were, uh, these were high points in her day and she was sort of proud of them, even now. 

01:40:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah, (inaudible ) I'm much more animation, as she told these pieces, then early on. 

01:40:25
JON CARLSON When this next piece, you help her to see how she is like others, who've been where she's been, and help her to develop a new story, let's watch how you spin this yarn for her. 

01:40:40
LEN SPERRY Okay. 

01:40:40
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:40:40
3-36 

01:40:40
LEN SPERRY Makes sense. You know, the, while you describe things is not much different at all from other people that have been very, uh, concerned about, about the kind of symptoms you describe, and often times they tell similar kinds of early life experiences as you've described, and almost always there's a sense where they're doing one of two things; they're either holding on really tight, uh, to themselves or feeling that their breath is holding them, in, very, very tight. And do you want to know what tends to happen with those individuals? After a period of time, something very interesting happens, and they wouldn't have predicted it, uh, other people they'd know never would've guessed that it would've happened, but it happens. You know what it is? 

01:41:55
KATHLEEN No. 

01:41:55
3-37 

01:42:00
LEN SPERRY All of a sudden out of the clear blue, that sense of tightness starts easing up, it tightens up a little bit, eases up a little bit and then it's, it's gone 

01:42:20
KATHLEEN That's very good. 

01:42:25
JON CARLSON It looks like she really got that to me. 

01:42:25
DIANE KJOS There's, uh, (inaudible ) that, the way her face looks and the way she's just intrigued by this whole piece, and, uh, really buying it. 

01:42:35
JON CARLSON Was that your sense? 

01:42:35
LEN SPERRY It was, there's, there's an element of the recognition reflex here, which is, it's, uh, it's, uh, nonverbal expression of, of her whole being, uh, responding to what, uh, what, the truth of her life (inaudible ). 

01:43:01
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)(inaudible )It's a confirmation. 

01:43:03
3-38 

01:43:03
LEN SPERRY Yeah, and well, and it, it is a, it appears to be a confirmation of, of, uh, of the formulation that I'm, uh, and this new story that I'm, I'm, I'm offering to her. 

01:43:10
DIANE KJOS And it's her eyes and her, the shaking of her head, the expression of her face, it's like, "Yes, yes." 

01:43:20
LEN SPERRY It's it's at this point, that I would say, that we've, we have joined in, uh, in a mutual effort to work together, this is what, what engagement means. So engagement has occurred at this point, we've been working up to it, but it's, it's, it's, it's occurred and it's, it's in process. 

01:43:35
JON CARLSON It almost looked hypnotic, to me. 

01:43:40
LEN SPERRY Yes it did. 

01:43:40
JON CARLSON I mean, that she was almost in a trance as you were talking to her. 

01:43:45
3-39 

01:43:45
LEN SPERRY Yeah, and trances aren't, aren't abnormal situations that are very much a part of most peoples life's, and I've noticed, I haven't any research to show this, but my experience is, is that, uh, person's that somatize tend to very easily, um, um, move into states, and, and it's very easy to induce, uh, states, hypnotic like states with them. 

01:44:15
JON CARLSON Well in the final clip, we're gonna see, you bring a lot of things together, you talk about her father, and you talk about her husband, and you talk early memories. Well what's this all about? 

01:44:30
3-40 

01:44:30
LEN SPERRY Well, I'm trying to, to pull together an explanation that makes sense to me professionally and one that, even more importantly cuz this is a client focused approach, that, that really fits her. My, uh, role in this session was, was really to help her articulate what her formulation is, what her, what her explanation about all these things that are happening in her life, because if she can have that, she has and is able to use in, in a very positive way, these, these power and control dynamics. Right now there, there not really working for her, there, there in a sense working against her, and so I would like to, to have her be able to understand her, her own personal narrative in a way that's, that's going to be, that's gonna work, make, help her be a responsible and cooperative individual, cuz I think that's what she wants to be. 

01:45:40
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk)So is going. Yeah, we, restructuring that, outside forces or demons sort of perspective of being visited by? 

01:45:45
LEN SPERRY Yes. 

01:45:50
JON CARLSON So what began as this biological session, really ends with a note of really weaving in the social and the psychological with this, uh, next piece we're gonna see. Let's watch it. 

01:46:00
KATHLEEN No. 

01:46:00
3-41 

01:46:05
LEN SPERRY The, the story you told, about, about the, uh, bicycles and the new house and about, uh, the swimming pool, both those, those situations in the short run didn't seem, uh, like they were absolutely happy endings but your life went on after that. 

01:46:30
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, right. Mm-hmm. Yeah it did. 

01:46:30
LEN SPERRY And it was, there, it was, uh, little point in time, seconds maybe a couple of minutes, and, and you got past, this, this, the spanking that came from, the person who you're probably the closest in your life. 

01:46:50
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. They were just trying to teach us, not to do wrong 

01:46:50
LEN SPERRY Yeah. Well and they may have been trying to teach you something else too. 

01:47:00
KATHLEEN True. 

01:47:00
LEN SPERRY Probably even more so, and then it's, uh, how, how to stay alive, to stay healthy. I think that's what, what, uh, the lesson was in both those stories. 

01:47:10
3-42 

01:47:10
KATHLEEN I think so too. 

01:47:15
LEN SPERRY And, uh, that's a legacy, that your parents gave to you. 

01:47:20
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:47:20
LEN SPERRY You always have those memories. Things weren't going well for a while they were very exciting up until that time when you were, you were roaming around the house and in the pool, and then this little, uh, reality, bit of reality comes in. 

01:47:35
KATHLEEN Mm-hmm. 

01:47:40
LEN SPERRY But nothing, nothing really bad happens, you don't die, you don't, uh, lose privileges and, and get grounded for, uh, 10 years, but, um there out of that, that experience something, uh, good came, your relationship was restored with your father, I'm sure he loved you as much as he did. 

01:48:05
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)Oh god Yeah! Yes he did. 

01:48:05
3-43 

01:48:05
LEN SPERRY And, uh, I'm wondering if, if, uh, that pattern, little pattern may, may repeat itself, just every so, occasionally in your life, in, in little mini fashion, in little miniature fashion. 

01:48:20
KATHLEEN (crosstalk)It might, I think it does. Yeah cuz I miss my dad a lot and that, you know like I said, with certain things, I do miss him. Wish they were here, like when we have children and I would miss. 

01:48:35
JON CARLSON Well looks like you really had a nice connection there at the end, with her, seems like she came a long way. 

01:48:40
LEN SPERRY Yes. 

01:48:40
JON CARLSON Are there any final comments that you might have about this interview, as you look back on it, and reflect on it? 

01:48:50
LEN SPERRY, M.D., PH.D. 

01:48:50
3-44 

01:48:50
LEN SPERRY Sure, and one of the pieces that, that wasn't covered here, that wasn't pursued, Diane mentioned it earlier, was the ideal of these outside forces, she used the word demons at one point, then we heard her say, uh, near the very end here, uh, about parents trying to keep them from doing bad, doing wrong. I, I would want to pursue, if there was subsequent interview, some of the cultural factors here. 

01:49:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Right. 

01:49:25
LEN SPERRY > What we do know so far is that Kathleen is, uh, is first generation Irish, and we might expect that, uh, that part of her, uh, upbringing involved, uh, of good, evil, uh, uh, battles and, and, and that there may be some superstition involved here. 

01:49:45
JON CARLSON (crosstalk)Yes. 

01:49:45
LEN SPERRY So the sensitivity to the cultural issues and, and how, how they affect her and the meaning they have for her would be something, that, that we would want to pursue. 

01:50:00
DIANE KJOS Mm-hmm. 

01:50:00
JON CARLSON Well thank you, this has been very, very helpful, in that this biological, psychological social approach just has so many different modes. It seems like each time there's a different modality that we're looking at. 

01:50:10
3-45 

01:50:10
DIANE KJOS Well it's, the other piece that it, that intrigues me, I think is that, is your ability to make those shifts, because she looked like a really difficult client and yet you were able to reach her by moving from one sort of, approach or one mode to another, and that was an intriguing piece of this whole video. 

01:50:30
LEN SPERRY And it's, it's not magic, it's, it's something that just takes, uh, a little, uh, focus on and a little experience, and I, I would guess that, that, uh, everyone that's in the psychotherapy professions is going to be able to, to reach clients such as, as Kathleen. By becoming, uh, aware of the need to focus on some of those other areas. 

01:51:00
JON CARLSON Well thanks for helping us get started.
