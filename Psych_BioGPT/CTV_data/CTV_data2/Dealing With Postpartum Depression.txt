Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:00:55
WINNIE KING , M.D. Hello I’m Dr. Winnie King in the lobby of the children’s hospital at Montefiore in New York city. So that’s why you are here and see a lot of activity in the background. Becoming a new mother is supposed to be a wonderful time of joy and fulfillment but for many women it can be a time of fear, shame and terrible despair. It’s called postpartum depression and its more than just the baby blues. It’s a devastating condition that left untreated can have a lasting effects on the whole family. This year about a half million women will suffer from postpartum depression in the United States alone. Yet most of them won't even try to get a help. Adrianne was one of those women, here is her story. 

00:01:35
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I came out the room, wild. Wildly I could just tell he came out with this, there was tremendous energy and he had this voice on him. He was a loud, upset, colicky um, not very easy could taken soul baby. 

00:02:00
TED HEWLETT Then I remember giving him his first bath and I was like I was convinced that neighbors are going to call child protection services on us because Ethan just screamed but so much of it was like that trying to get him to sleep, trying to get him to eat um, he just… he just dint want to be anywhere except you know, hack in the womb. 

00:02:15
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I couldn’t put him down. I couldn’t and it was… it was out of an overwhelming sense of gratitude and passion for this little child but it was also out of a… a just an object fear of what would happen to him if I left his side. There is a part of me desperate for some one that I could say, could you please hold him for one hour so I could take a nap but at the same time to do that it felt like cutting off my own arm. When the newness of it and the high of it started wear off and started to fall apart even more and so actually when we would fall asleep I was up and pacing like an animal. I mean, I couldn’t my mind of racing and um, I needed to check on him constantly and my heart would raise. I completely lost my appetite. Um, I was wired on coffee all the time, I was snappy with Ted. I didn’t want to be touched by him. I wanted so desperately help but it be help at the same time the guilt of that was overwhelming. The self learning was really, really, really, really profound. 

00:03:25
TED HEWLETT I kept thinking that if I could ease the level of work that she was doing or if I could you know, if I could just stay up another night and get her little more rest that it would just go away and it didn’t go away. 

00:03:40
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I was terrified I would leave. I was terrified I would walk out of the door again to the car and drive away and never come back. Um, I was never terrified that I would hurt Ethan um, but I was terrified I would go mad. 

00:03:55
TED HEWLETT I always wanted her snap out of it. I was like wake up, get over it, pull yourself out of this hole that you are in. At one point, Adrianne was out driving around in the middle of the night just because either you know we were trying putting him in the baby seat on the… on the washer and the drier and that didn’t work as well as driving around. So you know, she is driving in the middle of the night just sobbing because she is so exhausted. 

00:04:20
ADRIANNE HEWLETT So I was driving in this amazing thunder storm and crying and screaming and just sort of calling out for help and just saying I can’t do this… I can’t do this. Ethan fell asleep and so I pulled in to the drive way. The car kept running um, we were outside so that he was on. I called into the back seat with him and I fell asleep and Ted came out, woke up and we weren’t there and of course he was frantic and he came out just like what is going on? I said I can’t, I can’t do this anymore. I don’t… I don’t know what to do. And then back on that night I think I wish I had gotten help earlier. I started look back on myself as with compassion and go… you know really I’m not going to be ashamed off. 

00:05:10
WINNIE KINGS Wow! Such an amazing story. Just hearing all of the emotions that you went through I mean, you just can’t help it but feel for you... what made you finally decide to get help? 

00:05:20
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I took a trip with Ethan it was the first time, that I allowed myself to leave the house with him and really go see some friends and get out and enjoy myself and it was um, about an hour and a half drive. I went, I saw my friends we had a wonderful time. It was I felt a little bit like myself again, got back in the car and I felt elated just elated and my mind was racing and the music was up and I looked at the odometer and I was going at 100 miles an hour. 

00:05:50
WINNIE KINGS A 100 miles an hour? 

00:05:50
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I was going at 100 miles an hour and I thought I don’t really know what I’m doing anymore. I’m… I’ve crossed a line… 

00:06:00
WINNIE KINGS Yes. 

00:06:00
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Somewhere and I need to get help. 

00:06:05
WINNIE KINGS That did it. 

00:06:05
ADRIANNE HEWLETT That did it 'coz I was unknowingly putting my baby in danger. 

00:06:05
WINNIE KINGS Sure… 

00:06:05
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Yeah. 

00:06:10
WINNIE KINGS Sure… Well, you know there is some one here you has helped countless women through these feelings and her name is Dr. Shari Lusskin and she is the director of reproductive psychiatry at New York University school of medicine and this is an amazing story isn’t? 

00:06:20
SHARI LUSSKIN Unbelievable. 

00:06:25
WINNIE KINGS What… what’s going on here? Is this what people call the baby blues? 

00:06:25
SHARI LUSSKIN , M.D. Reproductive Psychiatrist This is not the baby blues. The baby blues is a mild form of mood change in the postpartum period. It's characterized by mild sadness, mild anxiety, mild insomnia, a mild sense of being overwhelmed and it goes away within two weeks. What you had is a postpartum depression. A postpartum depression is like depression at other times at a women’s life but it occurs in the context of having had a baby. 

00:06:55
MAJOR DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS • Extremely Sad Mood • Changes in Sleep Patterns • Loss of Appetite • Anxiety, Thoughts of Self-harm • Loss of Interest or Enjoyment in Activities 

00:06:55
SHARI LUSSKIN So sad blue, hopeless or helpless mood difficulty sleeping even when the baby is sleeping, losing your appetite, having thoughts of hurting yourself or escaping, having thoughts perhaps of even harming the baby. These are all symptoms of postpartum depression. 

00:07:15
WINNIE KINGS I know that you are very anxious about… 

00:07:15
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Yes. 

00:07:15
WINNIE KINGS …Ethan where you ever worried that you are gonna hurt him? 

00:07:20
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I was never worried that I would intentionally hurt him. 

00:07:20
WINNIE KINGS Hmmm… Hmmm… 

00:07:20
ADRIANNE HEWLETT But I was worried that because my level of confidence as a mother was so low that unintentionally I might do something to him. 

00:07:30
WINNIE KINGS We know Shari, we do hear in the news about women who do hurt their children or even kill them and that wasn’t going on here but what’s going on in that case when the mother is actually hurting the baby. 

00:07:40
SHARI LUSSKIN The women who hurts the baby or commits infanticide has a postpartum psychosis until proven otherwise. That’s a very different illness from what most women get. 20% of women in the postpartum period get depression only one to two per thousand get postpartum psychosis. And in postpartum psychosis the ability to know what's real from what's not real is lost and that’s what leads to problems. 

00:08:10
WINNIE KINGS Well, does every women who has a thought about hurting her baby.. Is she a person who is having postpartum psychosis? 

00:08:15
SHARI LUSSKIN I’m glad you brought up that point. Obsessions about harming oneself or harming the baby are very common in postpartum depression but rarely mean that the women will hurt herself or hurt the baby… 

00:08:30
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:08:30
SHARI LUSSKIN …that’s much less common. 

00:08:30
WINNIE KINGS Well, we don’t know for sure what causes postpartum depression but we do know that they are some women who may be at increased risk for and you should really be on the lookout for it, right? 

00:08:40
SHARI LUSSKIN Absolutely. Women who have a prior history of a mood disorder or an anxiety disorder, women who have had pre-menstrual mood changes, women who had a depression following a previous pregnancy whether they had a baby or pregnancy loss, women with a family history of pregnancy related mood disorders are all at very high risk. 

00:09:00
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. Well, now Adrianne you had some risk factors in your medical history didn’t you? 

00:09:05
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Yes I did. 

00:09:05
WINNIE KINGS Tell us about that? 

00:09:05
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I had had two depressive episodes previously one in my 20s and one in my 30s. We have a family history of depression and ah, I was been treated for depression during my pregnancy also. 

00:09:15
WINNIE KINGS Did you think that this could happen to you. Had it ever occur to you. The link between having had depression in the past and having this. 

00:09:25
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Yeah… I… it was… it was a fear, a mild fear but I was also very taken with the fact that I was pregnant, I was going to have this baby… 

00:09:30
WINNIE KINGS Sure. 

00:09:30
ADRIANNE HEWLETT …and move on that it was very much in a small voice in the background. 

00:09:35
WINNIE KINGS And you were on an anti-depressant weren’t you? 

00:09:35
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Yes I was. 

00:09:35
WINNIE KINGS and then you discontinued it? 

00:09:40
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I discontinued after I had the baby 'coz there was because I just had a baby. 

00:09:45
WINNIE KINGS Ha..ah..ha.. that changes everything. Child changes everything yes. Well, you know Shari isn’t it a good idea to prescribe anti-depressant for postpartum depression? 

00:09:50
SHARI LUSSKIN Well, anti-depressants are generally prescribed for postpartum depression but sometimes postpartum depression is a little more complicated and you need more than just an anti-depressant or another type of medication to really control the mood. So I’d encourage you to discuss all the symptoms you have with your doctor and your family history in detail so that you make sure you get the best combination of medications possible to get well as fast as possible. 

00:10:20
WINNIE KINGS Sure. Well, I see a lot of pregnant woman or women that have had a baby in my practice and the first question they always ask me is are these medication safe? I’m breastfeeding or I’m pregnant. What about anti-depressants. Are they safe in… 

00:10:30
SHARI LUSSKIN Well… 

00:10:30
WINNIE KINGS …women who are pregnant or breastfeeding? 

00:10:30
SHARI LUSSKIN The vast majority of anti-depressants appear to be safe in pregnancy meaning they don’t cause birth defects and they don’t cause serious complications in the neonatal period. But recently there has been some data released and some warnings by the FDA that raised the question about whether certain anti-depressants increase the risk of mild congenital defeats and whether anti-depressants increase the risk of transient neonatal difficulties. The thing to do is to inform yourself become an educated consumer, look at the internet, collect the information you may know more than the doctors you’ve been to but don’t be your own doctor. Take that information to a healthcare professional, discuss it in detail and decide if the benefits outweigh the risks in your particular situation. 

00:11:20
WINNIE KINGS Yeah, well you obviously did very well. And you look great. 

00:11:25
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Thank you. 

00:11:25
WINNIE KINGS What work for you? 

00:11:25
ADRIANNE HEWLETT The combination of finding the right medication for myself and talk therapy. I have a wonderful therapist… 

00:11:30
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:11:30
ADRIANNE HEWLETT …and we worked pretty intensively during that period of time. 

00:11:35
WINNIE KINGS Well you know Shari, Adrianne says that she wish that she'd got a help a lot sooner. You know once she sort off crossed that road and saw life in a different way she think why did I wait so long? Why do most women take so long to get help? 

00:11:45
SHARI LUSSKIN Well first of all. with 20-20 hindsight you too can be a doctor. Ha..ha..ha.. women don’t get help because they are ashamed of feeling depressed. It's that simple. 

00:11:55
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:11:55
SHARI LUSSKIN Guilt, (inaudible [00:11:58) and ashamed. 

00:12:00
WINNIE KINGS Sure and who should they reach out to when they want help? 

00:12:00
SHARI LUSSKIN Well, if you happen to have a psychiatrist or mental healthcare professional that you knows that’s an obvious place to turn. But of course the pediatrician may be the person you see the most often even more than you see your obstetrician. Basically reach out to whoever you can… 

00:12:15
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:12:15
SHARI LUSSKIN …family, friends, healthcare professionals seek help and don’t take no for an answer. Don’t let somebody write it off as baby blues when it's really not. 

00:12:25
WINNIE KINGS Well, what can happen if a women doesn’t get help? 

00:12:30
SHARI LUSSKIN An untreated mental illness really at any point in a women’s life can become a chronic relapsing condition if it's not treated but even perhaps more importantly it can affect the marriage or the relationship with the partner and they can have lasting impact on… 

00:12:40
WINNIE KINGS Sure. 

00:12:45
SHARI LUSSKIN …baby and the other children of the family. 

00:12:45
WINNIE KINGS Absolutely. Well you know Adrianne is one of the lucky ones and she got the treatment she needed and what a difference for the whole family. 

00:12:55
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Does (inaudible ) wants some juice. It was slow, it was very gradual but that I would say there was a point where I was looking at my relationship with Ethan and, and saying, Wow. I’m much more relaxed around him. I’m much less scared about something happening to him and the big thing was I started to have fun with him and I started to have nice (inaudible ) again. 

00:13:22
TED HEWLETT Being a dad to Ethan is fantastic, it's challenging, it’s a daily improvisation ah with training(ph) for the world. Ha..ha..ha.. 

00:13:30
ADRIANNE HEWLETT I’m looking at the world entirely different way that sort of colors that I’ve never seen before, not that it's not challenging, not that I’m still not exhausted but its… its… its better than I could have even dreamt off. 

00:13:50
WINNIE KINGS Adrianne what advice do you have for mom’s out there that are feeling the way you did? 

00:13:50
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Get help. Yes, call a mental health professional, start with friends, family, start talking. 

00:14:00
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. So you do that. The better… 

00:14:00
ADRIANNE HEWLETT Yeah. 

00:14:00
WINNIE KINGS …life starts to feel. 

00:14:05
ADRIANNE HEWLETT It's immensely treatable. 

00:14:05
WINNIE KINGS Yeah.
