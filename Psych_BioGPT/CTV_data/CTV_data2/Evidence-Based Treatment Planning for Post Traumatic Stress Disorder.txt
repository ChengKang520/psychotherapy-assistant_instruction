Evidence-Based Treatment Planning for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 

00:00:30
NARRATOR The following is a presentation of John Wiley & Sons. It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program focuses on posttraumatic stress disorder. 

00:00:45
Timothy J. Bruce Ph.D. Arthur E. Jongsma, Jr. Ph.D. 

00:00:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Hello, and welcome. I'm Art Jongsma, and joining me is my colleague Dr. Tim Bruce. Together we're going to discuss with you empirically informed treatment planning for posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. 

00:01:00
Modules DSM criteria for PTSD Essential Elements of Treatment Planning Brief History of the EST Movement Empirically Informing a Treatment Plan for PTSD Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention Evidence-Based Treatment Plan for PTSD 

00:01:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE This program is broken into a number of modules. In it, we'll describe the DSM criteria for PTSD, discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process, provide a brief history of the movement to identify empirically supported treatments, or EST's. We'll then show how to empirically inform a treatment plan with findings from the EST literature on PTSD. We'll spend some time discussing common considerations in relapse prevention and present an example of an evidence-based treatment plan for PTSD. 

00:01:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Before we get started, one thing should be noted. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan for PTSD can be empirically informed by incorporating goals, objectives, and treatment interventions consistent with those of identified EST's and with evidence-based practice guidelines. You'll also see brief scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. 

00:02:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE It's important to note that these scenarios are selected examples of the EST's and don't represent delivery of any one of them in their entirety. 

00:02:05
Defining PTSD-DSM Criteria for PTSD 

00:02:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Let's begin by looking at the DSM criteria for the disorder. 

00:02:10
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A: Traumatic Stressor Criterion B: Intrusive Recollection Criterion C: Avoidant/Numbing Criterion D: Hyper-arousal Criterion E: Duration Criterion F: Functional Impairment 

00:02:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Diagnostic criteria for PTSD include a history of exposure to a traumatic stressor, meeting two criteria as well as symptoms from each of three symptom clusters: instrusive recollections, avoidant/numbing symptoms, and hyper-arousal symptoms. A fifth criterion concerns the duration of symptoms and a sixth relates to functional impairment caused by the disorder. 

00:02:35
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion A: Traumatic Stressor 1. Experiences or witnesses an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury to self or others 2. Response of intense fear, helplessness or horror 

00:02:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. First, let's look at the stressor criteria. For PTSD, the person has to have been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following have been present. One, the person has experienced, witnessed or been confronted with an event or events that involve actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others. Two, the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Note, in children it may be expressed instead by disorganized or agitated behavior. 

00:03:15
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion B: Intrusive Recollection 1. Recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event 2. Recurrent distressing dreams of the event 3. Acting or feeling as if the event was recurring-illusions, hallucinations, flashbacks 4. Intense emotional distress at exposure to internal or external cues reminding one of the event 5. Physiological reactivity upon exposure to internal or external reminder cues 

00:03:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Exposure to the stressor is followed by a response involving symptoms from each of three symptom categories: again, intrusive recollections, avoidance/numbing and hyper-arousal. By intrusive recollection, we mean that the traumatic event is persistently re-experienced in at least one of the following ways. One, recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event, including images, thoughts, or perceptions. Again, note, in young children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the trauma are expressed. Two, recurrent distressing dreams of the event. And again, note in children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content. Three, acting or feeling as if the trauma were recurring. Includes a sense of reliving the experience, illusions, hallucinations and disassociative flashback episodes, including those that occur upon wakening or when intoxicated. Again, note in children, trauma specific re-enactment may occur. Four, intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event. Five, physiological reactivity upon exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event. 

00:04:40
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion C: Avoidance/Numbing 1. Avoids thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma 2. Avoids activities, places or people that trigger trauma recollections 3. Cannot recall important aspects of the trauma 4. Diminished interest in activities that were formerly enjoyable 5. Feeling detached from others 6. Restricted range of affect-feels numb 7. Pessimistic, fatalistic attitude about the future 

00:04:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The second set of symptoms required for this diagnosis reflect persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness, not present before the trauma. As indicated by at least three of the following: one, efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings or conversations associated with the trauma. Two, efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma. Three, inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma. Four, markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities. Five, feeling of detachment or estrangement from others. Six, restricted range of affect, for example, unable to have loving feelings. Seven, a sense of fore-shortened future, for example, does not expect to have a career, or marriage, or children, or a normal life span. 

00:05:40
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion D: Hyperarousal 1. Sleep disturbance 2. Irritability 3. Concentration difficulties 4. Hypervigilance 5. Exaggerated startle response 

00:05:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE The third set of symptoms characteristic of PTSD involve persistent symptoms of increased arousal not present before the trauma indicated by at least two of the following: one, difficulty falling or staying asleep. Two, irritability or outbursts of anger. Three, difficulty concentrating. Four, hypervigilence. Five, an exaggerated startle response. 

00:06:10
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criterion E: Duration Symptoms present more than one month Criterion F: Functional impairment Impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning 

00:06:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. To meet the criteria for PTSD, the duration of this response involving the symptoms just discussed must be more than one month. As with any mental or emotional disorder, the disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 

00:06:30
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Specifiers: Acute-Symptoms less than 3 months Chronic-Symptoms more than 3 months With or Without Delayed Onset (6 months after trauma) 

00:06:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Specifiers used with the diagnosis of PTSD in the DSM include whether it is chronic or acute and whether it is with or without a delay in its onset. The condition is considered acute if the duration of symptoms has been less than three months, and chronic if it's been more than three months. Delayed onset refers to symptoms whose onset occured after six months from exposure to the stressor. 

00:07:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Having reviewed what constitutes PTSD, we'll now move on to the process of psychotherapy treatment planning and describe its essential steps. 

00:07:10
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan Identify Primary & Secondary Problems Describe Behavioral Definitions Diagnosis based on DSM/ICD Criteria Specify Long-term Goals Create Short-term Objectives Select Treatment Interventions 

00:07:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE There are six essential steps in developing a treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual client's unique presentation. These steps are: identify the client's primary and secondary problems. Describe behavioral definitions of the problem, that is each problem's behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physical and interpersonal manifestations. Make a diagnosis based on DSM or ICD criteria. Specify the long-term goals for the treament process. Create short-term objectives for the client. And select therapeutic interventions. 

00:07:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment, but as a first step in creating a treatment plan, the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems, often by assessing which are most related to current distress, disability or both. Usually a primary problem will surface, and secondary problems may also be evident. Some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:08:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave, or interact will be to some degree unique to them and their situation. So each problem that is selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how it's evidenced in your particular client. Therefore, as a second step in the treatment planning process, the behavioral definition of the problem, that is the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, physical and interpersonal features of the problem are specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria such as those found in the DSM or ICD, which should be kept in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:09:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis, is based on an evaluation of the client's complete clinical picture. The clinician must compare the behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features causing distress or disability to the criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder as described in the DSM or the ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnoses per se, in formulating their treatment plans. But instead they prefer to focus on changes in the identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions, and the like. Having said that, most third party payers require a diagnosis, and most EST's are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems. So it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. 

00:10:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of the client's primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measurable terms, but can be broader and indicate a desired general positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:10:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Writing short-term objectives for the client to achieve is step five in developing a treatment plan. In contrast to long-term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and client in assessing progress. They're also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations, and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objectives should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:11:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapist interventions is the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention planned for every client objective. If the client does not accomplish the objective after the initial interventions have been implemented, new interventions should be considered. 

00:11:35
A Brief History of the Movement to Identify ESTs 

00:11:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Although it can conceivably be argued that the movement to empirically inform psychological treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in the early 1990's in Great Britain and then in the United States. 

00:12:00
Division 12 of the American Psychological Association: The Society of Clinical Psychology 

00:12:00
Division 12 Task Forces: The Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures (original) Task Force on Psychological Interventions (succeeding task force) http://www.Psychological Treatments.org 

00:12:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE On the forefront of the movement in the United States was Division 12 of the American Psychological Association, The Society of Clinical Psychology. In 1993, Division 12 organized a task force chaired by Doctor Diane Chamblis and charged it with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments whose efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. 

00:12:20
"Well-Established" "Probably Efficacious" 

00:12:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The group established criteria for judging quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorized treatment meeting these criteria as well-established or probably efficacious. Both sets of criteria required replicated demonstrations of efficacy through high quality trials or case series. The well-established category requires independent replication as well as other features, the details of which can be found in the workbook. 

00:12:55

00:12:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE By 1996, the group had identified a preliminary list of 25 EST's meeting their criteria. By 1998, the list had grown to 71 EST's. In 1999, Division 12 took full ownership of maintaining the growing list. The current list and information center can be found on its website.

00:13:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Since the work of this original group, other reviewers have emerged. Using the same or similar criteria to review literature related to these and other populations, problems, and interventions. These are some examples.

TIMOTHY BRUCE Descriptions of the treatments identified through many of these early reviews, as well as references to the empirical work supporting them, clinical resources and training opportunities can be found at the TheTherapyAdvisor.com. This resource was developed by personal improvement computer systems with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health and in consultation with the members of the original Division 12 task groups. There are also some organizational efforts to disseminate evidence-based medical and or mental health practices or practice guidelines worth noting.

Introduction to ESTs for PTSD 

00:15:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Empirically informing a treatment plan as described in this series involves integrating those aspects of identified EST's into each step of the treatment planning process discussed previously. Let's briefly look at efforts to develop and identify EST's and evidence based treatment guidelines for PTSD. The psychotherapy outcome literature in PTSD has grown significantly over the last decade. There have been several independent reviews of this literature that have identified empirically supported treatments and or treatment guidelines for PTSD. Although the conclusions and recommendations of these various reviewers are highly similar, there are some notable differences, largely dependent on the criteria used by the reviewers. 

00:16:05
From APA Division 12: Well-Established ESTs for PTSD: Prolonged Exposure Cognitive Processing Therapy Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Available at: www.psychologicaltreatments.org 

00:16:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Using the most rigorous criteria of all reviewers, APA's Division 12, The Society of Clinical Psychology, has identified three therapies that have met their original criteria for a well-established EST. These treatment approaches are prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, a treatment that combines exposure and cognitive therapies, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR. All of these treatments are what are called trauma focused, meaning the focus is on helping the client process the memory of the trauma. 

00:16:40
From APA Division 12: Probably Efficacious EST for PTSD Stress Inoculation Training Available at: www.psychologicaltreatments.org 

00:16:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Division 12 has also identified one therapeutic approach as having met their criteria for probably efficacious. This therapy is called stress inoculation training. Stress inoculation training is not trauma focused but rather helps train skills intended to facilitate the client's current adaptive functioning. 

00:17:00
Ponniah, K., & Hollon, S.D. (2009) Empirically supported psychological treatments for adult acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder: A review. Depression and anxiety.26(12)1086-1109. Well-established Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapies that use exposure with or without cognitive restructuring EMDR 

00:17:00
Possibly Efficacious Treatments: Stress Management/Stress Inoculation Training 

00:17:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Another very recent and independent review was conducted by Ponniah and Hollon using criteria highly similar to those used by Division 12. These reviewers concluded that trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapies that use exposure, with or without cognitive restructuring meet the criteria for a well-established EST. Although noting that it has a lesser body of supporting evidence, these reviewers also cited EMDR as meeting these same criteria. Stress inoculation training was again judged as showing efficacy, but not at a level warranting its status as a well-established EST. These reviewers categorized it as possibly efficacious. Using criteria less rigorous than the probably efficacious used by Division 12. 

00:17:50
Little evidence to support the use of: Relaxation training alone Group CBT Family therapy Supportive counseling 

00:17:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Lastly, Ponniah and Hollon noted that they found little evidence to support the use of relaxation training alone, CBT delivered in a group format, family therapy or supportive counseling. 

00:18:05
International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies First-line options of CBT comprising: Exposure therapy Cognitive therapy Stress inoculation training Therapies that combine exposure with formal cognitive therapy or stress inoculation training EMDR 

00:18:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Other reviewers have used criteria less rigorous than Division 12's for a well-established EST. These criteria have typically valued high quality randomized controlled trials, but did not require independent replication of results as did Division 12. Reviewers using these criteria have drawn more inclusive conclusions regarding empirically supported treatment options for PTSD. One example is found in the guidelines for the treatment of PTSD copyrighted by the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. These guidelines conclude that CBT comprising exposure therapy, cognitive therapy, stress inoculation training or therapies that combine exposure with formal cognitive therapy or stress inoculation training, should all be considered first line options for the treatement of PTSD in addition to EMDR, which was also indicated as an appropriate first line option. 

00:19:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Consistent with the NICE guidelines and Ponniah and Hollon's findings regarding the lack of evidence for group format therapy, the guidelines recommend that the treatments discussed should be delivered through one on one therapy. 

00:19:15
Najavits, L.M., (2007). Psychosocial treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. In P.E. Nathan and J.M. Gorman (Eds.) A guide to treatments that work (pp. 513-530). New York: Oxford University Press First-line options: Trauma-focused Therapies (e.g. exposure, EMDR, cognitive therapy) Present-focused Therapies (e.g., SIT) 

00:19:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Lastly, Najavits, in the latest edition of Nathan and Gorman's, "A Guide to Treatments that Work", came to similar conclusions using similar criteria. She noted that both trauma focused therapy, such as exposure, EMDR and some applications of cognitive therapy as well as more present focused therapies, such as stress inoculation training are all first line options and as such allow therapists some latitude in first line choice. 

00:19:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. So Tim, let's talk briefly about these therapies and the conclusions of these reviews. Treatments for PTSD may focus on the past, on the original trauma, the present, or both. 

00:19:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, in general, the past focused or trauma focused treatments, they ask the client to imagine, think, talk about the trauma that precipitated the PTSD repeatedly and in some detail, while processing the memories and the emotions that it evokes. 

00:20:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. There are numerous named therapies that fall into this past focused category, including imaginal exposure, prolonged exposure, narrative exposure as well as EMDR. 

00:20:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, generally speaking, that's true, there are a number of them. 

00:20:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And present focused therapies, what about those? 

00:20:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, present focused therapies emphasize helping the client learn and implement skills that strengthen their current adaptive functioning. Examples include stress management approaches such as stress inoculation training and some applications of cognitive therapy are present focused. And as you said, many therapies will focus on both the past and the present. 

00:20:55
Cognitive Therapy 

00:20:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Okay, let's move on to cognitive therapy, or cognitive restructuring. It's focused on identifying and changing maladaptive thoughts and beliefs related to the trauma or that have come about as a result of it. 

00:21:10
Key Concepts in Cognitive Therapy Identifying biased self-talk Generating alternative self-talk, Engaging in prediction testing Behavioral experiements 

00:21:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, cognitive therapy typically involves teaching the client the connection between thinking and feeling, you know? Identifying biases in the thoughts that may be perpetuating maladaptive emotional reactions like unwanted fear and avoidance in this case, challenging those thoughts, and generating alternatives to them that correct for the bias. 

00:21:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The focus may be on trauma related thoughts and feelings or on more present day consequences. 

00:21:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it's used in both past and present focused applications. When cognitive restructuring is focused on present day issues, the biases and alternative thoughts are often converted into predictions and then tested through behavioral experiment exercises. 

00:21:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. That's where the therapist helps the client convert the biased and alternative thoughts into predictions of what will actually result should they try some activity that they may fear or avoid or are otherwise reluctant to do it. 

00:22:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. And then the client performs the activity to test which prediction is most accurate. 

00:22:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. This is repeated with the biased predictions until the alternatives replace them as more believable. 

00:22:15
Cognitive Shift: Shift in belief from biased, maladaptive appraisals to alternatives that are more reality based 

00:22:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, ideally the process is repeated and expanded until this quote, unquote cognitive shift, you know, in the belief of the alternatives is accomplished and then consolidated. It's belieavable. 

00:22:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Does cognitive therapy use all of the usual didactic techniques and strategies including psychoeducation, guided discoveries, Socratic questioning, role playing, imagery? 

00:22:40
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes. Yeah. It does. It also uses interventions that derive from behavioral traditions such as teaching you know, adaptive coping and problem solving skills and the like. 

00:22:50
Cognitive Processing Therapy 

00:22:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Some therapies for PTSD combine exposure and cognitive restructuring. 

00:22:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. 

00:22:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Cognitive processing therapy is one of these, right? 

00:23:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, cognitive processing therapy is an empirically supported treatment that was originally developed for sexual assault victims but has been expanded to other trauma populations. 

00:23:10
Cognitive Processing Therapy Involves trauma-focused exposure to a narrative written and read by the client Cognitive restructuring of the thoughts and feeling elicited by exposure to the trauma memory. 

00:23:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. I understand it involves trauma focused exposure but using a narrative of the trauma written and read by the client as well as cognitive restructuring of the thoughts and feelings elicited by it. 

00:23:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, that's a, that's a great description. And with PTSD subsequent to sexual assault, themes of that cognitive restructuring are likely to include issues like safety, trust, intimacy and the like. 

00:23:35
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Uses exposure to images of the trauma with concurrent eye movement in a highly structured protocol 

00:23:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Now, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR. It's a more recent therapy that uses a form of imaginal exposure to the trauma memory but within a highly structured protocol that involves the eye movement component. What's that protocol like? 

00:23:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Well, the classic EMDR procedure asks clients to hold an image related to the trauma in their mind's eye while tracking an object back and forth across their visual field, usually the therapist's fingers. But some therapists have used other distracting tasks such as flickering light bars and tapping and things like this. 

00:24:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The client is asked to monitor this image as well as thoughts, emotions and physical sensations associated with it while they engage in the eye movement task. And repetition is a part of this exposure procedure also? 

00:24:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. You know, if no change is detected by the client in any of those domains while they're doing the eye movement task, then the eye movement task is repeated. If change is detected in any of them, the client then holds this new experience, whatever it is, and then repeats the procedure. 

00:24:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The procedure is repeated in this way until a therapeutic change is achieved in which the image, thoughts, feelings or all of these change in a way that's less threatening, more reassuring to the client. 

00:25:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, that's exactly right. And then this new perspective is reinforced by holding it while doing the eye movement procedure, kind of strengthening it. Other images are then subjected to the same process until the change has, if you will, generalized across various images related to the trauma. That is, in general terms, the classic EMDR protocol. 

00:25:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. EMDR has been the subject of controversy. Wasn't that partly because of its widespread adoption by so many therapists before its efficacy had been demonstrated convincingly? 

00:25:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, that's part of it I think, you know. To me a more fundamental concern has to do with its use of imaginal exposure to the trauma memory. One of the current criticisms of EMDR is that it uses a form of imaginal exposure. And imaginal exposure is an existing treatment that has already established its efficacy. Some critics have called into question whether the unique features of the treatment, such as the whole eye movement component add any unique contribution over and above the imaginal exposure. 

00:26:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. So the issue is whether a newly developed treatment that adds ineffective components to an already efficacious therapy should be recognized as an independent evidence based treatment. 

00:26:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. 

00:26:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. But given that criticism, the treatment delivered in its classic form still has shown efficacy in the treatment of PTSD. 

00:26:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE It has, and the review groups we discussed earlier have acknowledged that. 

00:26:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Now, let's move on to stress inoculation training or SIT. 

00:26:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Okay. 

00:26:30
Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) A multi-component, present-focused therapy...focused on improving their current adaptive functioning 

00:26:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. This is a multi-component present focused therapy that is tailored to the individual client's needs and is focused on improving their current adaptive functioning as opposed to focusing on the trauma itself. 

00:26:45
SIT Interventions Psychoeducation Calming and coping skills training Interpersonal skills building Cognitive self-talk interventions Exposure 

00:26:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. SIT, stress inoculation training, includes pyschoeducation, calming and coping skills training, such as relaxation training, interpersonal skills building, such as assertiveness skills, as well as cognitive interventions such as guided self dialogue, which we're going to show a little later, an example of that. And at times has included exposure, although in clinical trials, that component is often left out when it's being compared to exposure. 

00:27:15
SIT Techniques Dialog Modeling Covert (or imaginal) modeling Role-playing Self-reinforcement 

00:27:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. SIT uses several techniques typical of behavior therapy such as modeling or covert or imaginal modeling, role playing, self reinforcement to teach skills. 

00:27:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, and it's tailored to the individual client's needs based on a thorough assessment of what would best improve that particular client's current adaptive functioning. 

00:27:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. But in EST reviews using Division 12 criteria, or its equivalent, and in guidelines using something similar, SIT does not meet criteria for well-established treatment. 

00:27:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE That's true for PTSD. The guidelines from NICE recommend using trauma focused interventions first-line. 

00:28:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And reviewers using less rigorous criteria suggest that SIT is a first-line choice with other well-established treatments. 

00:28:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, most treatment providers recognize value in attending to the present with some clients like SIT does. And most will not use trauma focused interventions if they feel the client can't or won't discuss the trauma in any detail, leaving SIT as an option. 

00:28:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The NICE guidelines suggest building trust and alliance in these cases toward the goal of doing trauma focused therapy. But in some cases, a client just can't or won't do it. 

00:28:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it's true in severe trauma. I mean this issue with present focused therapies that exist in the guidelines today may eventually be addressed as more studies are done. In the meantime, it's important for therapists to know of it and why it's there, you know? They can decide which recommendations best serve their clients. 

00:28:50
Integrating the EST into Treatment Planning 

00:28:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE After determining that posttraumatic stress disorder is the primary presenting problem, we then add to the treatment plan those behavioral manifestations of PTSD that define the client's expression of the disorder. Although there are commonalities in the presentation of PTSD, the treatment plan is tailored to each client's particular expression of it. 

00:29:15
Examples of Behavioral Definitions 1. Has been exposed to a traumatic event involving actual or perceived threat of death or serious injury 2. Reports response of intense fear, helplessness, or horror to the traumatic event 

00:29:15
Examples of Behavioral Definitions 3. Experiences disturbing and persistent thoughts, images, and/or perceptions of the traumatic event 4. Experiences frequent nightmares 5. Describes a reliving of the event, particularly through dissociative flashbacks 6. Displays significant psychological and/or physiological distress resulting from internal and external clues that are reminiscent of the traumatic event 

00:29:15
Examples of Behavioral Definitions 7. Intentionally avoids thoughts, feelings, or discussions related to the traumatic event 8. Intentionally avoids activities, places, people, or objects that evoke memories of the event 9. Inability to remember various important aspects of the traumatic event 10. Displays a significant decline in interest and engagement in activities 11. Experiences feelings of detachment or distance from others 12. Experiences an inability to experience loving feelings 13. Reports a sense of a forshortened future 

00:29:15
Examples of Behavioral Definitions 14. Experiences disturbances in sleep 15. Experiences intense anger and irritability 16. Reports difficulty concentrating as well as feelings of sadness and guilt 17. Reports hypervigilance 18. Demonstrates an exaggerated startle response 

00:29:15
Examples of Behavioral Definitions 19. Engages in a pattern of substance abuse 20. Acknowledges increased marital and family conflict 21. Displays eruptions of occasional violence 22. Displays social withdrawal, sadness, and thoughts of suicide 23. Symptoms present more than one month 24. Impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning 

00:29:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. You may select from the list of behavioral definitions of PTSD shown here. For example, with this disorder your client will obviously include a history of exposure to a traumatic stressor. Then there will be one or more symptoms from each of three symptom clusters: intrusive recollections, avoidant/numbing symptoms, and hyper-arousal symptoms. You may include a symptom statement that is also commonly a part of PTSD but is not a DSM criteria symptom such as engages in substance abuse or has occasional eruptions of violence. Some statement about the duration of symptoms should be included as well as a statement about the functional impairment caused by the disorder. 

00:30:00
Examples of Long-term Goals 1. Eliminate or reduce the negative impact trauma related symptoms have on social, occupational, and family functioning 2. Returns to the level of psychological functioning prior to exposure to the traumatic event 3. No longer experiences intrusive event recollections, avoidance of event reminders, intense arousal, or disinterest in activities or relationships 4. Thinks about or openly discusses the traumatic event with others without experiencing psychological or physiological distress 5. No longer avoids persons, places, activities, and objects that are reminiscent of the traumatic event 6. Feels more relaxes and is less irritable and reactive 

00:30:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE The next step in treatment planning is to determine long term goals. These are generated collaboratively with the client. Examples might include: eliminate or reduce the negative impact trauma related symptoms have on social, occupational and family functioning, or no longer experiences intrusive event recollections, avoidance of event reminders, intense arousal or disinterest in activities or relationships. Of course, there may be other goals that you want to pursue as well. 

00:30:30
Assessment Phase Short-Term Objectives 1. Describe in detail the nature and history of the PTSD symptoms Therapeutic Interventions 1. Establish rapport with the client toward building a therapeutic alliance 2. Assess the type, frequency, intensity, durations, and history of the client's PTSD symptoms and their impact on functioning (e.g., The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for the DSM-IV by DiNardo, Brown, and Barlow) Short-Term Objectives 2. Cooperate with psychological testing. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Administer or refer for psychological testing or use objective measures to assess for the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms (e.g., MMPI-2, Impact of Events Scale, PTSD Symptom Scale, or Mississippi Scale for Combat Related PTSD); re-administer as needed to assess outcome. See the Workbook for more complete information 

00:30:30
Short-Term Objectives 3. Acknowledge any substance use. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess the presence and degree of substance use by the client. 2. Refer the client for a comprehensive substance use evaluation and treatment, if necessary Short-Term Objectives 4. Verbalize the symptoms of depression, including any suicidal thought. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess the client's depth of depression and suicde potential and treat appropriately, taking the necessary safety precautions as indicated. 

00:30:30
Short-Term Objectives 5. Describe the traumatic event in as much detail as comfort allows. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Gently and sensitively explore the client's recollection of the facts of the traumatic incident and their emotional reactions at the time Short-Term Objectives 6. Cooperate with a psychiatric evaluation to assess for the need for psychotropic medication Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assess the client's need for medication (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and arrange for prescription, if appropriate. 2. Monitor and evaluate the client's psychotropic medication prescription compliance and the effectiveness of the medication on his/her level of functioning. 

00:30:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. We now direct our attention to client objectives and therapist interventions consistent with empirically supported treatments for PTSD. While common to all forms of therapy, the assessment phase of PTSD treatment typically involves obtaining a detailed description of the nature and history of the PTSD symptoms as well as the impact of PTSD on his or her social, occupational and interpersonal functioning. Psychological tests or objective measures may be used to supplement the clinical interview and, or track treatment response. The initial assessment often includes assessment of comorbidity, such as substance abuse as well as depression and suicide risk. The client may also be asked to provide a cursory description of the traumatic event without giving details or exploring the feelings associated with it. And of course, the assessment phase may involve an evaluation for medication. 

00:31:30
Psychoeducation Short-Term Objectives 7. Verbalize an accurate understanding of PTSD and how it develops Therapeutic Interventions 1. Discuss how PTSD results from exposure to trauma results in intrusive recollection, unwarranted fears, anxiety and a vulnerability to others negative emotions such as shame, anger, and guilt; and results in avoidance of thoughts, feelings, and activities associated with the trauma. Short-Term Objectives 8. Verbalize an understanding of the treatment rationale for PTSD. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Educate the client about how effective treatments for PTSD help address the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral consequences of PTSD using cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches. 

00:31:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Empirically supported treatments for PTSD emphasize initial and ongoing psychoeducation. In addition to helping facilitate a client's progress in the therapy, the process and content of psychoeducation is used to reassure, instill hope, motivate, and otherwise enhance a therapeutic relationship. Common themes include conveying a conceptualization of PTSD consistent with the treatment model describing the treament approach and its rationale and enhancing engagement of the client in treatment. Examples of objectives and interventions consistent with psychoeducation may look like this. Reading material may be assigned to supplement psychoeducation done in session. 

00:32:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Let's take a look at a brief vignette reflecting assessment and psychoeducation interventions. In this scene, the therapist does some initial assessment of PTSD symptoms and some initial pyschoeducation about PTSD. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN What brings you in for counseling today, Bonnie? 

00:32:35
BONNIE It's been a rough several months for me. I'm, I'm not sleeping well. I'm having nightmares. I'm on edge and irritable and sometimes I have flashbacks. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN I see. Your life has changed and you're struggling with tension, anxiety and some bad memories. Can you tell me a little of what may have triggered all these problems? 

00:32:55
BONNIE Well, I worked as a bank teller and the bank was robbed by a masked man with uhm, a big gun. 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN I am sorry. I'm sure that was very frightening for you. 

00:33:05
BONNIE Yeah, it certainly was. I, I haven't been back there since it happened. I don't even drive down that street. 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN Okay. And how is it for you to talk about the robbery? 

00:33:15
BONNIE I don't talk about it with anyone. It, uhm, it brings it all up again. But I know I'll have to here. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN I do need to learn some things about it. But let's take it at your pace. 

00:33:25
BONNIE Okay. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN How long ago was the robbery? 

00:33:25
BONNIE It's been about six or seven months ago now. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN And was anyone threatened or injured during the incident? 

00:33:35
BONNIE He shot the guard in the leg and he threatened to kill us all. Uhm, he put the gun right to my friend Gail's head and, and she screamed. Uhm, she was right next to me. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Oh my. This had to be terribly scary for you and everyone else in the bank. 

00:33:50
BONNIE Yeah it was. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN And since the robbery, you have experienced several problems you haven't had before? You mentioned trouble sleeping, feeling more irritable, flashbacks. Can you tell me about the flashbacks? 

00:34:05
BONNIE Uhm, I'll just suddenly see some image from the incident, like, like Gail's face or the guard's leg after he was shot. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN I see. And of course you've said that you haven't returned to work or even gone near the bank. You've avoided driving on the same road. You've also avoided talking or thinking about the robbery? 

00:34:20
BONNIE Uhm, that's right. I, I try not to think about it, but sometimes it just jumps into my mind, or something may remind me of it. Uhm, like a TV commercial about a bank or something like that. So I don't watch TV anymore, and I used to enjoy doing that. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN So the thoughts force themselves into your mind at times, and how do you feel when that occurs. 

00:34:40
BONNIE I get all nervous and tense all over again. Sometimes I feel shaky and, you know, like a little sick to my stomach. Uhm, it's awful. I hate it. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN So it's almost like the robbery was happening all over again. 

00:34:55
BONNIE Exactly. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN I can sense your frustration over this. What you are experiencing is posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. It's often seen in men and women in the military as they encounter life threatening traumatic experiences on the battlefield. Your life threatening experience occurred right here close to home. But your emotional, behavioral and physical reaction is similar to our servicemen and women. PTSD is a type of anxiety disorder that is triggered by being a witness to or experiencing directly a traumatic event that brings on intense fear. PTSD often includes intrusive recollections of the trauma, like the flashbacks and nightmares you've been having. 

00:35:40
BONNIE The nightmares are awful. Uhm, they'll wake me up in a sweat. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN I know. Unfortunately, that's part of it. It's also common to feel upset, tense, or anxious or have trouble sleeping after experiencing such an intensely fearful event. Now most people avoid things that remind them of the event, like thinking about it, talking about it, seeing things on TV that remind you of it. And in your case, going back to the bank. 

00:36:10
BONNIE That sounds like me. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, you're experiencing PTSD, and you have taken a big step today by seeking counseling to help you overcome it. 

00:36:20
BONNIE I have been thinking about coming here for a while. Uhm, my husband has asked me over and over to get some help. Can this really be treated? 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Yes. There are approaches to treating PTSD that have been found effective for many people. We'll talk about the options. I also have a book I would like for you to read that explains more about PTSD and its treatment. I'll give it to you as you leave today. How's that sound to you Bonnie? 

00:36:45
BONNIE Good, thank you. 

00:36:50
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Well, we're in the assessment phase here, but really quite early in the assessment phase, particularly at the beginning of this vignette. 

00:36:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah, it's clear what we're seeing here is the assessment of the symptoms of PTSD. Uhm, you know, she talked about flashbacks, and she's looking at avoidance. 

00:37:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Yes. 

00:37:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE And uh, so this is what this represents. What it doesn't represent, although you know in the vignette you kind of see it fade. 

00:37:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. A fade out and a fade back in. 

00:37:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, so what's occurring during that fade is a very comprehensive assessment that you would do with this disorder. 

00:37:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Looking at comorbidity issues. 

00:37:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE There's common comorbidity with this disorder. So you're seeing an excerpt of just that aspect of dealing with the PTSD. 

00:37:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Sure. One of the things I liked about how she handled the client was a lot of reinforcement of, I understand. And a lot of communication using I messages and it's a way for that client to feel that she's in touch with the therapist. 

00:37:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, you know, empathy for uhm, you know the individual who's been traumatized. It's very much communicating that. She did a good job with that. 

00:38:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. There's rapport building going on here and this client, you know, we talked about some of those factors that are relationship oriented rather than just technique oriented. 

00:38:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Oh, absolutely. 

00:38:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And these are quite important. This is a difficult thing for this client to talk about. 

00:38:15
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Oh yeah, and you know, this is one type of trauma. You know, some PTSD is very very severe. These things become very critical in terms of keeping the client in the therapy and trusting. I think one of the things that uh, is important to know is, you know, where is this going? So this is going into, uh, not only here's what's going on. This is PTSD, but also the conceptualization of PTSD that then supports why we treat it the way we do and the rationale for that treatment. 

00:38:40
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. You're seeing some psychoeducation going on here too, not just assessment, but there's certainly psychoeducation going on. 

00:38:45
Prolonged Exposure Therapy Objectives and Interventions Short-Term Objectives 9. Cooperate with Trauma focused Prolonged Exposure Therapy Therapeutic Interventions 1. Utilize prolonged exposure to process memories of the trauma at a client-chosen level of detail, for an extended period of time (e.g., 60-90 minutes); repeat in future sessions until distress reduces and stabilizes (see Prolonged Exposure Therapy for PTSD: Emotional Processing of Traumatic Experiences: Therapist Guide by Foa, Hembree, and Rothbaum; or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder by Resick and Calhoun. 2. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he or she does self-directed exposure to the memory of the trauma. 

00:38:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, and it kind of, you know, demonstrates how these things aren't just cut and separate a so on. It all kind of blends. Having briefly reviewed assessment and psychoeducation objectives and interventions, let's move now to integrating objectives and interventions consistent with the therapeutic features of identified EST's for PTSD. In prolonged exposure, the client recounts in detail the traumatic memory in the order in which the events unfolded, including his or her thoughts and feelings along the way. The client is essentially providing a running commentary on what they remember happening. Typically the therapist periodically asks for a rating of discomfort to assess the client's response and to get some indication of the degree of extinction. The process is repeated until the recounting no longer evokes high levels of distress and until the trauma memories are experienced as memories rather than a reliving of the event. Homework exercises in which the client does self-conducted imaginal exposure may be assigned after the client has made some progress and understands the procedure and its purpose. 

00:40:00
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Let's take a look at a vignette depicting a client participating in an initial session of imaginal exposure to the memory of a trauma. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN As you know, Bonnie, our goal this session is to start talking about the robbery incident in a little more detail. 

00:40:15
BONNIE Yeah, I, I know. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN I'm going to ask you to go through it as you remember it. You can tell me whatever you like and if there are things you don't want to talk about, you don't have to. Okay? 

00:40:25
BONNIE All right. Uhm, can I stop if I need to? 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN Absolutely. Take this at your own pace. If you want a break, just stop. You can continue when you're ready. It may help to remind yourself, Bonnie, that you've been talking about this with me already and you've been able to do it. 

00:40:50
BONNIE If I get upset, uhm, I'll be okay. It'll pass. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN Perfect. You remembered your positive self statements. 

00:40:55
BONNIE Yeah. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN As you describe the incident, I'm going to periodically ask you to give me a quick SUDS rating. Just give me what you feel at that moment and continue on, okay? 

00:41:05
BONNIE Okay. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN why don't we begin by getting comfortable. Taking a few breaths and relaxing a little bit. So what is your rating right now, Bonnie? 

00:41:20
BONNIE About a three or four. I'm a little nervous. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Okay. You're fine. Nervousness is to be expected. Are you ready to begin, or do you want to relax a little more? 

00:41:35
BONNIE No, let's go ahead. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Good. So why don't you begin by telling me how your day began as you came to work that day. 

00:41:45
BONNIE Well, I got to the bank at my usual time of 9:30. Uhm, the other girls were arriving about the same time. Uhm, Gail, who was the teller next to me was a few minutes late because she was taking care of her sick daughter, who was staying home from school that day. Uhm, Gail was, was worried about her being home alone and almost didn't come in. She should have stayed home and she would have missed the robbery. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Good. You're doing fine. Your rating? 

00:42:15
BONNIE Uhm, five. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Okay. Go ahead and continue when you like. 

00:42:20
BONNIE Uhm, well, the manager is always the one who unlocks the door at ten in the morning. Uhm, the guard was over talking to Tom at his desk. Everything just seemed normal. Nobody came in right away but then uhm, this guy bursts through the door with a mask on. 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN Okay. What's your rating? 

00:42:45
BONNIE Uhm, seven. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN Okay, so this part is a little more provocative for you. That's understandable. You doing okay? 

00:42:55
BONNIE Yeah. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Take your time Bonnie, and remember it's safe here. These are only images. Try to think of them like a motion picture. Do you want to continue or wait a little bit? 

00:43:15
BONNIE No, it, it's okay. Uhm, as soon as I saw him I froze. Uh, he yelled, "Everybody put your hands in the air." And then he, he showed us his gun. I remember that I started shaking uncontrollably. I, I thought I was going to panic. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN That's understandable. It was a frightening situation to be in. 

00:43:40
BONNIE It, it was. I'm shaking a little now just thinking about it. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN That's okay. Try to just let it be. You're doing fine. Again, they're just images. What's your rating right now? 

00:44:00
BONNIE Uhm, still about a seven. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Take whatever time you need. Do you want to relax a little bit? 

00:44:10
BONNIE Yeah. 

00:44:15
[sil.] 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN You can continue when you want. So he backed up toward the door? 

00:44:20
BONNIE Yeah. I could see his shoes but I wouldn't, didn't want to look up too much. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN That was smart thinking. 

00:44:30
BONNIE Yeah, and then he ran out the door. Everybody was kind of frozen. Uhm, Tom ran over to the guard to see if he was okay. I saw that Gail was crying and shaking. Uhm, I sat down next to her and I was shaking and crying too. We just hugged each other. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN I see. You helped comfort each other. 

00:45:00
BONNIE Yeah, we, we just hugged each other. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN What's your rating now Bonnie? 

00:45:05
BONNIE A four. 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Okay. Why don't we stop Bonnie. You've done really well. I know this wasn't easy for you but you made it through the whole thing. 

00:45:20
BONNIE Yeah, I, I didn't know if I could. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN I understand. That's anxiety making a false prediction again. You did make it through. You did a great job. Why don't we take a second to relax and then we can talk about where we're going from here. 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:45:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Here we have the beginning of exposure. And pairing that again with some cognitive restructuring. But she's getting the client to talk about her trauma in some level of detail this time and with some emotion tied to it. And she also brings in the relaxation side and trying to get her to calm herself and take it at her own pace and be safe. 

00:46:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I mean, one aspect shown here, I think it's a demonstration of the rudiments of exposure. You know, you're recounting this trauma. This is a good example of that kind of verbal approach, not the narrative, but the verbal approach. 

00:46:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. She's not writing it out, but she is talking it through. 

00:46:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE She's not writing it out. She is recounting it kind of as it unfolded in whatever level of detail she can. 

00:46:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And she may write it out at a future session. 

00:46:30
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE She might. Taking SUDS ratings to watch what's happening. In regards to relaxation I think it's important, uh, for viewers to also hear that you know, approaches to exposure now are, are not emphasizing relaxation as much but trying to access really essentially what is referred to kind of the memory network associated with the trauma. So there is going to be some discomfort. And the idea basically is, is that has to be exposed and then, for therapy to be therapeutic, whether you do this through cognitive restructuring and working with the thoughts associated with it or or you just let that thing kind of drain all the, you know, emotion from it. 

00:47:10
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Let them stay with the feeling rather than to escape from it using calming techniques. 

00:47:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Exactly, so this demonstrated kind of an overuse of relaxation to calm her, which may be appropriate initially for some. It depends at the therapist's judgement. But ideally you're wanting to access- 

00:47:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. There's a balance that needs to be maintained. 

00:47:25
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, you don't want to re-traumatize, but you want to access what's, what's scary. But I think all in all, uhm, this does show the, the basic structure of, of prolonged exposure. You know, getting at that account of the trauma, tracking the anxiety and so on. So it does do that. 

00:47:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Applications of cognitive therapy have also been identified as empirically supported in the treatment of PTSD. As discussed earlier, cognitive therapy typically involves teaching the client the connection between thoughts and feelings, identifying biases in the thoughts that may be perpetuating maladaptive emotional reactions, challenging those thoughts and generating alternatives to them that correct for the biases. 

00:48:10
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive restructuring may be focused on trauma related thoughts and feelings, on more present day consequences, or both. When cognitive restructuring is focused on present day issues, the biased and alternative thoughts may be used for prediction testing through behavioral experiments as discussed previously. 

00:48:30
Cognitive Therapy Objectives and Interventions Short-Term Objectives 10. Identify, challenge, and replace biased, negative, and self-defeating thoughts resulting from the trauma. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Explore the client's schema and self-talk that mediate his/her trauma-related fears; identify and challenge biases; assist him/her in generating appraisals that correct for the biases and build confidence in them. 2. Assign the client to keep a daily log of automatic thoughts associated with themes of threat and danger (e.g., "Netative Thoughts Trigger Negative Feelings" in the Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner, 2nd ed. by Jongsma); process the journal material to challenge distorted thinking patterns with reality-based thoughts and to generate predictions for behavioral experiments. 3. Reinforce the client's positive cognitions that foster a sense of safety and security and decrease fearful and avoidance behavior (see "Positive Self-Talk" in the Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner, 2nd ed. by Jongsma). 4. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she identifies fearful self-talk, tests, though behavioral experiments, the predictions from these dysfunctional thoughts, and creates reality-based alternatives; review and reinforce success, providing corrective feedback for failure (e.g., Overcoming Posttraumatic Stress Disorder by Smyth). 

00:48:30
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Accordingly, objectives and interventions reflecting the use of cognitive therapy and PTSD treatment highlight primary emphases on identifying maladaptive self talk, challenging its biases, and generating alternatives that correct for the biases and are more reality based. Homework assignments are often used to strengthen cognitive restructuring done within the session and may involve journaling exercises that reinforce positive changes and those representing behavioral experiments. 

00:49:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Let's look at a vignette showing the use of cognitive therapy techniques for PTSD. In this vignette, the therapist is following up on some initial session based psychoeducation and reading to help the client identify biases in her thinking that have resulted from exposure to trauma and that are contributing to some of her distress. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Bonnie, today I'd like to continue to focus on how the PTSD is affecting your thinking patterns. Are you okay with that? 

00:49:30
BONNIE I guess so, sure. Is this about that material you asked me to read about the ways uhm, that thinking can trigger anxiety? 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN Exactly. We've talked about how thinking influences our emotional reactions to things. And we've talked about how to listen to yourself talk. PTSD can introduce changes in the way that we think about those things, and those thoughts can create the negative emotional reactions associated with it. This pattern then makes people want to avoid thinking about it at all, because the feelings that are triggered are so distressing. 

00:50:10
BONNIE Uhm, yeah, I, I read about uhm, biased thought patterns and remembered something about uh, catastrophizing or something like that, right? 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Yes. That's the one that we will be exploring. Very good. And there's one called filtering, and black or white thinking, and discounting, and several others. Let's look at your thoughts about the bank robbery and see if there are any of these biases that may be causing you to stay fearful and avoid reminders of the robbery. Since our last session, you got a chance to record some of your self talk about this issue? 

00:50:45
BONNIE Uhm, yeah. I put some of my thoughts down about it. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN What did you find? 

00:50:50
BONNIE Uhm, well I wrote that if I think about it or talk about it I'm going to get upset. Uhm, and I wrote I'm afraid I'm going to fall apart just like I did when the guy finally ran out of the bank. I fell to the floor uhm, shaking and crying. I couldn't help it. It was just awful. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN I know this isn't easy, and I appreciate that you're trying. You've done a very good job of capturing the kind of self talk we want to become more aware of. Now can you see that this self talk is predicting that if you think about the incident, you'll experience the same emotions you did when the robbery actually occurred and that you'll fall apart if you do? Can you think of that as a prediction? 

00:51:35
BONNIE Okay. Yeah. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN And when you're thinking these thoughts, how does it make you feel? 

00:51:40
BONNIE Scared. 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN Yes. It would anyone. And anyone's tendency at that time would be to avoid thinking about it, wouldn't it? 

00:51:45
BONNIE Yeah, which is exactly what I do. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Exactly. So let's examine whether this prediction is actually true, and if not, let's see if we can identify how it's biased. You did actually shake and cry after the real incident, something we'd all agree is a normal reaction. But this prediction, the one I want to focus on, is that talking or thinking about the incident will make you break down just like when it really happened. Do you agree? 

00:52:15
BONNIE Yes, that's true. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN And althought you've been trying to avoid it, you actually have talked about it several times with me. So let's be very accurate here. What have you felt when talking about the incident to me? 

00:52:30
BONNIE I don't know. I guess nervous at first? I was afraid to, but I did. It still scares me to think about it, but I've been able to do it here. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Yes you have. That's being very accurate. And that's not the outcome that the prediction is making. If I talk about it it's going to get worse. I'm going to break down. In fact, you've been nervous, scared to a degree, but you've been able to do it. You haven't broken down but do you see how the self talk isn't quite accurate about what's going to happen when you think or talk about the robbery? The prediction is wrong. 

00:53:05
BONNIE Yeah, I hadn't really thought about that. I guess I have talked about it with you. It's not that easy though. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN I understand. It's not easy. But it is something you've been able to do. 

00:53:20
BONNIE That's true. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN So Bonnie, this prediction that if you think or talk about the incident, your feelings will overwhelm you and you will lose control and break down. It hasn't been happening that way. In reality, it hasn't been easy, but it has been manageable. So what biases from our list might be operating in this fearful prediction. 

00:53:45
BONNIE That's catastrophizing isn't it? 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN Yes it is. Catastrophizing is a common consequence of having experienced a trauma. After something like that, there's a tendency to overestimate the liklihood that the worst case scenarios are going to happen. But when we're catastrophizing, we're also discounting our ability to cope with and recover from experiencing the feelings associated with the trauma. When you think that recalling the robbery will result in such drastic consequences, it makes your fear of talking about it escalate, and your desire to avoid it stronger. 

00:54:20
BONNIE I understand, but what do I do about it? 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN As a first step, why don't you try replacing the thought of I'm going to lose control with something more accurate like even if I cry and shake, it will pass. I can pull myself together. I can face these memories in small steps. 

00:54:40
BONNIE Tell myself even if I cry or shake, I can handle it. I can face this stuff in small steps. 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN That thought is more accurate. It also counters the part of catastrophizing that forgets that you can cope. 

00:54:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Well here the therapist begins by explaining biases and trying to get this client to understand the biases behind her self talk. 

00:55:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, I mean, we're in the middle of cognitive restructuring. This client's at, you know, obviously done some reading. They've probably done some work looking at self talk and its influence and now she's moving into looking at biases (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And you can see how the client's beginning to label her own self talk, I think at one point. 

00:55:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, she's learning something about it, isn't she? 

00:55:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. That's right. 

00:55:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE I mean, there are four or five different biases they had in there. 

00:55:25
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. I thought also it was interesting how she was beginning to realize that her own self talk is inaccurate, because the therapist points out, listen, you did talk to me. You talked your way through this trauma at least once at some level of detail and it didn't overwhelm you. 

00:55:35
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, part of challenging the bias in a way by using evidence to challenge the bias. 

00:55:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And she's teaching her how predictions can flow from her self talk so that they can be tested. 

00:55:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, and I like that she addressed the notion that just because you can understand alternatives, you've got to convert these into predictions. You've got to go see that they're valid before the belief in those all turn into this is really going to occur and be permanent. 

00:56:00
Cognitive Processing Therapy Objectives and Interventions Short-Term Objectives 11. Write and read a narrative account of the trauma while examining thoughts and feelings associated with it. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Utilize cognitive processing therapy techniques by asking the client to write and then read a narrative account of the traumatic incident while cognitively restructuring biased, maladaptive thoughts and feelings associated with it. 2. Assign homework in which the client listens to a recording of the narrative read during the last session; review during subsequent session; process thoughts and feeling associated with it. 

00:56:00
Short-Term Objectives 12. Participate in present-focused exposure therapy involving safe, but currently feared activities 

00:56:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Cognitive processing therapy is an empirically supported treatment for PTSD that combines trauma focused imaginal exposure and cognitive restructuring. Exposure in CPT is to a narrative account of the trauma written and read by the client. Cognitive restructuring of the thoughts and feelings elicited by it is conducted during and often after the exposure. In a treatment plan, these primary emphases can be captured in objective statements such as this, and therapeutic intervention statements such as this. In present focus treatments for PTSD, live exposure or exposure in vivo is commonly used. Exposure is to objects, situations and/or activities that are associated with the trauma and often feared and avoided. 

00:57:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE These exposures are to safe situations, but ones that elicit maladaptive emotional, physical, cognitive and behavioral reactions in the client due to their association with the trauma. Examples include driving a car again after being involved in an accident, or using elevators again after being assaulted in an elevator. Exposure is designed to help the client realize that the feared situation is no longer dangerous and that the anxiety associated with it does not persist when they do the feared activity repeatedly. 

00:57:30
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Direct and assist the client in constructing a fear and avoidance hierarchy of trauma-related stimuli 2. Utilize in vivo exposure in which the client gradually exposes themselves to objects, situations, places negatively associated with the trauma 3. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she does an exposure exercise and records responses (see "Gradually Reducing Your Phobic Fear" in the Adult Psychotherapy Homework Planner, 2nd ed. by Jongsma or Overcoming Posttraumatic Stress Disorder by Smyth); review and reinforce progress, problem-solve obstacles 

00:57:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. A fear hierarchy, in which situations are identified, rated, and then ranked from least to most feared, typically guides the exposure. Therapeutic sessions and homework assignments involving graduated exposure characterize the bulk of the treatment. 

00:57:50
Stress Inoculation Training Objectives and Interventions Short-Term Objectives 13. Learn and implement calming and coping strategies to manage challenging situations related to trauma Therapeutic Interventions 1. Teach the client strategies from Stress Inoculation Training such as relaxation, breathing control, covert modeling (i.e. imagining the successful use of the strategies), and/or role playing for managing fears until a sense of mastery is evident (see Clinical Handbook for Treating PTSD by Meichenbaum) 

00:57:50
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Stress inoculation training, or SIT, is an empirically supported present focused treatment for PTSD that involves building the client's skill set for managing challenging situations then strengthening those skills to practice with increasingly challenging tasks. In it's application to PTSD, SIT often involves challenging feared and avoided situations associated with the trauma and the training of skills facilitative of that. 

00:58:20
Short-Term Objectives 14. Learn and implement guided self-dialogue to manage thoughts, feelings, and urges brought on by encounters with trauma related situations Therapeutic Interventions 1. Teach the client a guided self-dialogue procedure in which he/she learns to recognize maladaptive self talk, challenges its biases, copes with engendered feelings, overcomes avoidance, and reinforces his/her accomplishments; review and reinforce progress, problem-solve obstacles. 

00:58:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. But SIT is individually tailored and designed to enhance overall functioning, so its focus may go beyond those situations. Guided self dialogue is an intervention derived from SIT and used in other present focused treatment for approaches to PTSD. It teaches the client a tailored skill set that may involve calming strategies, positive realistic self talk, rehearsal and self reinforcement for use in managing challenging situations. 

00:58:55
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE The technique guides the client in the preparation and execution of challenging situations. Its use is developed and rehearsed in session and then applied and strengthened through practice with increasingly challenging situations. In this vignette, the therapist teaches the client a guided self dialogue approach to a challenging situation associated with a trauma. Let's take a look at it. 

00:59:20
UNKNOWN So let's talk about an approach we want to try that's designed to help you with a goal of doing things that you've been avoiding. It's called Guided Self Dialogue. 

00:59:30
BONNIE Okay, how, how do you do it? 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Well, we're going to break any tasks into four steps. With each step, we're going to identify self talk and any coping strategies we want to use to help us manage it. Let's use this sheet. It helps take us through each of the steps. So, the four steps are preparing for the activity, managing demands of the activity, managing your own feelings during the activity, and looking at it afterwards, recognizing how you did and building upon it. 

01:00:10
BONNIE So these are examples of things I might want to ask myself or say to myself? 

01:00:15
UNKNOWN Yes. Before any activity, let's look at these and see if you feel any apply. We may come up with a few of our own too. So under preparing for the activity you want to ask yourself what exactly is it I have to do? We want to be very specific and break it down into steps. Then what exactly am I afraid of? Again, we want to be very specific and challenge the fear with these questions. First, what is the true liklihood of it actually happening the way I'm picturing it? Here we want to be as objective as possible, like we've been doing. And if it's not likely, we want to let it go and think about what actually is likely. But if what we are afraid of really could happen, we want to ask, how bad would it really be if it happened? And how would I want to cope? Okay Bonnie, under preparing for the activity, one of your fears is that while you are driving by the bank you're going to panic and do something out of control like having a wreck or just stop. And to that question, what is the actual probability of that happening? You said, not likely. 

01:01:30
BONNIE Well, I might panic, but it's, it's probably not likely that I'll lose control. At least not when I think of it objectively. I'm still nervous about it. 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN Nervous that...? 

01:01:45
BONNIE I won't handle it well. 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN That's understandable. It brings us to the next one. How bad would it actually be if you got nervous or even panicked? And what would you want to try to do? 

01:01:55
BONNIE Well, I wouldn't like it, but I guess I would just pull over if it got bad until I could calm down. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN Now, that's an option. And the self talk might be, if I get too nervous, I'll just pull over and calm myself down until I can go again. 

01:02:15
BONNIE Yeah. 

01:02:15
UNKNOWN You might find that panicking isn't the most likely thing. But does it feel better to have a plan for it? 

01:02:20
BONNIE Yeah, I'd rather be prepared. 

01:02:25
UNKNOWN I understand. So, let's imagine you did panic and felt you had to pull over. How would you want to try to calm yourself? 

01:02:35
BONNIE Just breathe and relax like we've done. 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN And what would you try to do with your thoughts? 

01:02:40
BONNIE Just talk to myself, try to build my self confidence. 

01:02:45
UNKNOWN Saying what? What helps you regroup and get you back to what you were trying to do? 

01:02:50
BONNIE Probably something like it's just your heart racing, you can do this. Things like that. 

01:03:00
UNKNOWN I think that's excellent. So we have a plan for dealing with nervousness if it gets too uncomfortable. Do you think you will need it? Or do you think driving by anxiously perhaps is more likely? 

01:03:10
BONNIE Actually, just talking about it and thinking of how, and stuff, makes me feel like I can probably do this. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN Okay, so let's go through each question you answered, put this activity together and the self dialogue you came up with. Then we can rehearse doing the whole thing in imagination. 

01:03:30
BONNIE Okay. 

01:03:30
UNKNOWN So our situation is driving by the bank. Under the question, what am I afraid of? You said panicking and losing control, possibly having an accident. When we asked about the actual probability, your answer translates to something like this: panicking isn't likely. If it happens, it's not likely to overwhelm me, make me lose control and cause an accident. I may get nervous, but I can handle that. Do you want to keep those or modify them in any way? 

01:04:05
BONNIE That sounds good. Uhm, I may want to say, if it happens, it's not going to overwhelm me instead of it's not likely to overwhelm me. 

01:04:15
UNKNOWN Okay, good. That helps more? 

01:04:20
BONNIE Yeah, it makes me feel stronger. 

01:04:20
UNKNOWN Okay. good. Next, we're going to explore the question, how will I manage my feelings while I'm driving? We came up with I'll stay focused on what I'm doing, use my breathing to relax. It's just my heart beating faster. I can do this. Do you want to use this or do you want to modify it in any way? 

01:04:45
BONNIE No, I think that will help me. Maybe we could add, uhm, it will go away when I get through this. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN Okay. And finally, we looked at the unlikely worst case and asked, if I do get to feeling too nervous, what will I do? That came out as, if I need to I can always just pull over and calm down before starting again. How's that sound? 

01:05:10
BONNIE Good. 

01:05:10
UNKNOWN So let's put all these pieces together and rehearse, using them to accomplish driving by the bank. 

01:05:20
BONNIE Okay. 

01:05:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Guided self dialogue. Here is a procedure that I don't think is used as pervasively as some of the others. But the client is now in the position of trying to understand what this is all about. The therapist is explaining the steps, points out the four steps, and even gives them on paper so that the client can see them. And it's really a combination of a lot of different techniques, isn't it? 

01:05:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE It is. And what your seeing is kind of a somewhat concrete looking approach to it. Let's go through these steps, but the idea basically is that the client eventually internalizes this. And this comes out of stress inoculation training and the idea also is to pull from these various skills that the client has uhm, acquired during the therapy. Their congnitive restructuring skills, their calming skills, you know, whatever skills they need. Management of anxiety, and so on into this kind of consolidated approach to dealing with stressful situations. So, you know, again, back to stress inoculation. We're going to build our skills to manage stress, in this case posttraumatic stress or a specific fear and avoidance related to it. And so you're seeing the beginning of it, but the notion is they're going to do this over and over again. 

01:06:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. And so you see cognitive restructuring. You see behavioral stuff. You see some exposure techniques going on. And the therapist points out that even exposure has taken place here. Just talking about it has seemed to reduce your anxiety. 

01:06:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. And I think it represents again, a technique commonly used in stress inoculation trainings, one of the EST's for PTSD. This technique comes out of that, and it kind of shows its major components, it's major techniques. 

01:07:00
EMDR Therapy Objectives and Interventions Short-Term Objectives 15. Participate in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) to reduce emotional reaction to the traumatic event. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Utilize Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) to reduce the client's emotional reactivity to the traumatic event and reduce PTSD symptoms 

01:07:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Lastly, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR, is an empirically supported treatment of PTSD that may be part of your treatment plan. As discussed previously, EMDR uses a highly structured protocol involving imaginal exposure to trauma images combined with bilateral eye movement. In a treatment plan, it is sufficient simply to identify the treatment approach and its major objective or objectives when describing the use of a defined structured protocol such as EMDR. 

01:07:40
Relapse Prevention 

01:07:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Whether treated pharmacologically, psychologically or both, PTSD, like all anxiety disorders is prone to relapse. Let's take a look at some common considerations in relapse prevention and how they can be incorporated into your treatment plan. 

01:07:55
Relapse Prevention Objectives and Interventions Short-Term Objectives 1. Explain the rationale of Relapse Prevention interventions Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 

01:07:55
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. One of the first steps in relapse prevention is to provide a rationale for the procedure. This typically involves a discussion of the risk for relapse and how using the relapse prevention approach can lower that risk. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this. 

01:08:15
Short-Term Objectives 2. Distinguish between lapse and relapse. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Discuss with the client the distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a temporary setback and relapse with a return to a sutained pattern thiking, feeling and behaving that is characteristic of PTSD. 

01:08:20
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Another initial step in this relapse prevention approach is to distinguish between a lapse and relapse. A lapse is presented as a rather common, temporary setback that may involve for example, re-experiencing an intrusive recollection of the trauma, or finding oneself avoiding something safe associated with the trauma after having not done so for some time. Relapse on the other hand is described as a return to a sustained pattern of thinking, feeling and acting that is characteristic of PTSD. The rationale for this distinction is that lapses do not need to develop into a relapse if they can be caught and managed. This component of relapse prevention can be captured in a therapist intervention such as this one. 

01:09:00
Short-Term Objectives 3. Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Assist the client in identifying and listing situations in which the client is at greater risk of relapse; review previous situations that have been triggers for obsessive compulsive thoughts or behavior. 

01:09:05
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Accordingly, high risk situations that might make the client vulnerable to a lapse are identified. This discussion may be informed by past difficult experiences or anticipated new ones. Some examples might include having an interpersonal conflict after not having had one for some time, going to a new place where exposure hasn't been done and being in the presence of old triggers for it, having a stressful day, week, or other period and starting to ruminate negatively about the trauma. The therapist intervention such as the one on your screen now illustrates how you might state this identification process. 

01:09:45
Short-Term Objectives 4. Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Identify and rehearse with the client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur. 

01:09:45
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE For the high risk situations identified, the therapist leads the client in a rehearsal of using skills learned in therapy to manage them including the skill of developing a tolerance for occasional thoughts and feelings while working on how to begin problem solving them. Identifying and rehearsing the management of high risk situations can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this one. 

01:10:10
Short-Term objectives 5. Encourage routine us of skills learned in therapy. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Instruct the client to routinely use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., continued everyday exposure, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 2. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information can be kept (e.g., steps in problem-solving, positive coping statements, reminders that were helpful to the client during therapy). 

01:10:15
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. In addition, to using skills learned in therapy to manage high risk situations, clients are also urged to use strategies learned in therapy during their day to day life. Examples include everyday exposures, self statements reflecting the new messages gained through cognitive restructuring, and problem solving. The intervention now on your screen reflects this prevention emphasis in the treatment plan. Sometimes clients benefit from having a coping card or other reminder of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. If you decide to use this aid, it can be captured in the treatment plan by including this second intervention for objective number 5. 

01:11:00
Short-Term Objectives 6. Schedule Periodic "Booster" Therapy Sessions. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Schedule periodic maintenance or "booster" sessions to help the client maintain therapeutic gains and problem-solve challenges. 

01:11:00
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally, periodic booster session of therapy can help reinforce positive changes, problem solve challenges and facilitate continued improvement. So clients are invited to periodically revisit therapy for these purposes. Treatment intervention number six describes the use of booster sessions in the treatment plan. 

01:11:20
Short-Term Objectives 1. Learn and implement strategies to prevent relapse of disruptive behavior. Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention the discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 2. Discuss with the client the distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with a temporary setback and relapse with a return to a sustained pattern of thinking, feeling and behaving that is characteristic of PTSD. 3. Identify and rehearse with the client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur. 4. Instruct the client to routinely use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., continued everyday exposure, cognitive restructuring, assertive communication), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 5. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information can be kept (e.g. steps in problem solving, positive coping statements, reminders that were helpful to the client during therapy) 6. Shcedule periodic maintenance or "booster" sessions to help the client maintain therapeutic gains and problem solve challenges. 

01:11:20
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. The table on your screen shows an example of how the therapist interventions we've discussed could be incorporated into a psychotherapy treatment plan to help the client achieve the objective of learning and implementing relapse prevention strategies. 

01:11:40
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE On your screen now apears an example of a final treatment plan that incorporates all of the steps of evidence based psychotherapy treatment planning that we've presented in this program. It includes the the primary problem, behavioral definitions of the problem applicable to your client, the diagnosis or diagnoses, the long-term treatment goal or goals, and short-term client objectives and related therapist interventions consistent with those of empirically supported treatments, including those related to assessment, initial and ongoing psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, trauma focused prolonged exposure, more present focused exposure in vivo, tailored applications of stress inoculation training and relapse prevention.

More complete information on the Objectives and Interventions seen in this program can be found in the Workbook and Facilitator's Guide. 

01:12:45
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. Today's discussion focused on evidence based psychotherapy planning using goals, objectives and treatment interventions consistent with those found and identified in empirically supported treatments and evidence based treatment guidelines. As you can see, there's a significant body of research in this area. 

01:13:05
DR. TIMOTHY BRUCE As mentioned previously, the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of evidence based psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health problems. It's designed to be informative in nature and does not intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about empirically supported treatments, references to the empirical support, clinical training materials, and training opportunites are provided in the companion workbook to this DVD. 

01:13:35
DR. ARTHUR JONGSMA, JR. We hope this information will help you in helping your clients live happy and productive lives.
