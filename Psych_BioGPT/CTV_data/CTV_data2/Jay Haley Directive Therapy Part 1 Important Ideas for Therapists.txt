Jay Haley (1923-2007) was known as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, strategic therapy, and brief therapy. His early work was in collaboration with some of the foremost thinkers of our time such as, Gregory Bateson and Milton H. Erickson, MD. He was a professor at Stanford University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, and at the California School of Professional Psychology. He published more than 20 books and over a hundred papers.

Jay HaleyWell, I think this is a very exciting time in Therapy. Uh, It's exciting because there's no orthodoxy. There's no way to do it, that everybody agrees upon. The problem is if you don't have an orthodoxy, you can't be a deviant. It used to be a nondirective therapy time. All you had to do was tell somebody what to do and you were outside the pale. You were a deviant. Now if you do it, you're likely to become a school therapist because everybody is doing it differently, and there's no right way. It means that, uh, people go to training and learn how to do it and then find out some other trainer teaches very differently. Or they go to a workshop and find a way to do it, and then go to another workshop, which is very different from the first one. And I think what you begin to realize is that, uh, at this time everybody's gonna have to design their own therapy, that there isn't a proper way to do it. There has to be a way that you can satisfy yourself that it's the best way to do it. You'd think, uh, that after a hundred years, there'd be agreement on how to formulate a problem, how to intervene, how to do a follow up. But there isn't even an agreement that you should formulate a problem or that your job is to change people(inaudible ). There's many therapist who still consider it the tradition to be that, uh, you, you don't set out to change someone, you help them understand themselves and if they change or not its up to them. That's a legitimate position that many people take. There is some consensus developing, and I think, uh, the way therapy's financed is bringing us together. That it used to be that a brief therapist was almost a cad, really, and now everybody's taking workshops in brief therapy, uh, with some enthusiasm. It's curious that the business people who know nothing about therapy are determining the length of it and how it's to be done, and a whole variety of, uh, rules that get established. But even so, you can be surprised at the premise. I was a therapy watcher for a long time or I'd go watch a therapist and record 'em, and then sit down and go over the tape on why he or she, uh, did what they did. And I was often surprised at what I thought they were doing; they didn't think that's what they were doing. And I think that's the case now. That, uh, there's basic premises about therapy that get carried on, and sometimes there's misunderstanding about 'em. Ah, let me give an example of a therapist I worked with named Leo Schiff. He had a 12 year old boy problem. A women, a mother brought in this boy and said, "He wet the bed, and he'd always wet the bed," and she'd had him to every therapist she could take him to and had any kind of machinery, and the kid, right, went right on wetting the bed. So Dr. Schiff was one of a series of people she'd taken him to. So he said what a Director of Therapy says, uh, "Would you be willing to do anything to get this boy over this problem?" And she said, "Yes." And he said, "Well, I want you to pay the boy $50 every time he wets the bed." And she said, "Alright," and she did. And the boy made about $150 and stopped wetting the bed. And she was telling her pediatrician about it. The pediatrician says, "That's crazy. You don't reward a kid for the behavior you're trying to extinguish." And she said, uh, "Well, I don't care, he stopped." It's, uh, the pediatrician was thinking in terms of Learning Theory and Reinforcement, and so on, and Schiff wasn't but it looks like he should be. Ah, so that, uh, what I'm saying is, there's variety of premises that people are working with that, that if you're designing your own therapy, you have to put some thought on what's actually happening and how does it fit the premises. You really, uh, you need to have two or three kinds of theories if you're going to design your own therapy. You have to have a theory of why people are the way they are. And, uh, I think we're best on that theory. Everybody has a theory of how somebody got the way they are. If you say something about, uh, say a bulimic, everybody will have a theory of how they became bulimic and why. When it comes to a-, another theory, though, that you also have to have, that's a Theory of Change. And they may not be related to the theories of why people are the way they are. Theories of change are more difficult. If you ask a therapist what's your theory of change, they tend to become inarticulate. That is, they often know what to do but they don't know how to describe it because the language isn't very appropriate. Because most of the language was created for explaining why people do what they do, the origins of, the variety of symptoms that occur. But there, I think there's about three major theories that came out of the nineteenth century, which was a very interesting and fertile time. You know, for those of you not familiar with it, there's a very good book called, "The Discovery of the Unconscious," by Ellenberger. For he describes what happened about 1880, when therapists began to try to, uh, understand why some people did something and then said, "They couldn't help themselves." That is, they'd would, uh, not be able to take a bath, and say, "They can't help themselves." Or they'd, they'd not be able to stop anything, and say, "They couldn't help themselves." Most symptoms tend to be opposites. But the, the involuntary behavior when they said, "I don't know why I'm doing this. I'm ruining my life with this, by drinking so much, and I don't know why I do it." Well they got interested in that problem, which is the basic clinical problem of symptomatic behavior and they came up with three explanations. One was The Unconscious. Either it was created or discovered at that point. For they said, "A person was driven by an unconscious ideas to do things and therefore, consciously they didn't know why they did it." and it seemed logical as a theory, to make them conscious of their unconscious, and Freud was born into that. There was another explanation, and that was Multiple Personality. That a person was doing something and didn't know why because another personality took over. And that was a very interesting theory in about 1880. And we've had an anniversary phenomenon. In the 1980's it's come back again, now. As I understand it, in 1980 there were about 200 cases of multiple personalities worldwide. In 1987 there were 6,000 in the United States alone. So the personalities are multiplying. There's people whose whole practice is multiple personality. Because once they discovered childhood sex abuse and that the multiple personality might be the logical outcome of that, they, uh, picked that up as the theory and, uh, define everything as multiple personality, many, many do. It gives 'em a way of working. There was a third explanation and that was Spirit Possession, in 1880. That a, a spirit possessed the person and drove 'em to do things, and they didn't know why because they couldn't deal with the spirit. This is probably the most common explanation still, worldwide. In Africa, China, South America it's very big. In Brazil, ah, there's something like 30,000 spiritist centers and those are just the legitimate ones, I mean the legal ones. They, uh, are very skillful at getting a spirit who possesses you to cure you. They have some interesting ways of working. I don't know if it's very big in this neighborhood but in many parts of the world it is very big. At any rate, those were at least three of the theories that came out. And the one Freud choose was The Unconscious. That you're driven by unfortunate things in your unconscious to behave as you do. And, uh, he made a very powerful ideology out of that and a powerful way of working, which persist to this day. He also made a decision at that time, that I think is very important. There's turning points in therapy. Here's a paper he wrote, a little excerpt. He wrote this paper, it's called "Heredity and the Aetiology of the Neurosis," in 1896. And he says, it's the first time he mentions the term psychoanalysis, and he says, "By means of this method," which was psychoanalysis, "Hysterical symptoms are traced to their origin, which invariably proved to be an experience in the person's sexual life, well adapted to produce a painful emotional reaction. Going back into the patient's life step by step, guided always by the structural connection between symptoms, memories and associations, I finally came to the starting point of the pathological process and I had to realize that the same factor was at the bottom of all the cases subjected to analysis. Namely, the effect an agent that must be accepted as the specific cause of hysteria. It's indeed a memory connected with the person's sexual life but one that presents two extremely important features. The event, the unconscious image of which the patient has retained, is a premature sexual experience with actual stimulation of the genitalia, the result of sexual abuse practiced by another person; and the period of life in which this fateful event occurs is early childhood, up to the age of 8 or 10 before the child has obtained maturity." He says, "I've been able to analyze 13 cases of hysteria completely. The experience mentioned was not lacking in a single case. It was present either as a brutal attempt committed by an adult or as a less sudden and less repugnant seduction, having however, the same result. In 7 cases out of the 13 we were dealing with a, lay, liaison between children. Sexual relations between a little girl and a boy slightly older, generally her brother, who had himself been the victim of an earlier seduction. These liaisons were something continued for years, up to puberty. The boy repeating upon the little girl without alteration, those practices he himself had experience in the hands of a servant or a governess." So that, he's saying, um, he says that, he doubts that whether a passive, ex, sexual experience occurring after the age of 8 or 10, probably isn't the foundation of a neurosis. But, now that's a hundred years ago that, uh, he proposed this explanation of why young women had the symptoms they had. And, uh, if he had stayed with that, he would have had to deal with the fathers and the brothers. He would've had to deal with the mothers who weren't protecting the daughters. He would've been in what we're into today. But, it, he didn't go that direction. A few months later, he changed his mind and he said, ah, "This were the wishes and the memories that were false of these young women." And he didn't say, one or two were, he said all of them were. And with that, he took the situation inside the person, as a matter of memories and perception, rather than into the action of the family, which we now are dealing with, now. I think it's also interesting that essentially he said, these are false memories. And we're into that situation now, with so many, uh, cases, some of 'em quite tragic. Where a therapist helps a person remember something that didn't happen and the person then accuses the parents, and everybody gets in an uproar and very upset over something that actually was a false memory. So the therapist had, a, a, are finding it necessary to separate out false memories from real memories, which is no easy task. But at any rate, uh, he made that turning point and it kept everything inside the individual. And it was unfortunate in other ways, that, I remember in the 50's, that if a young woman said, her father had incest with her, she was hospitalized. It was routine, because there must be something wrong with her, uh, a delusion, an inner nature. So they, women, young women took quite a beating when they tried to make an issue of this. So these are not ideas that, that disappeared. They're ideas that continue today. Certainly, the psychodynamic ideas haven't disappeared. But the practice is also, if you're going to be a therapist and decide how you're going to practice, they had a, a set of procedures, which were a very large influence in the field. For some reason, it became the rule that there should be no directors. Nobody should tell anybody what to do in therapy. A nondirective therapy became a pride, really. It was also, that the therapy should be neutral and not be personally involved with anybody because that was pathological. It was also, that the therapist wasn't responsible for change. That, uh, if people would, were helped to realize why they had the problem, then whether they changed was up to them. But if they didn't change it wasn't the therapists fault. It was a comfortable theory for therapists, really. It assumed that awareness was the cause of change. That you make interpretations. Help people remember or help people realize the connection between the past and the present, and it was based on the theory of repression, that ideas and feelings are repressed and they have to be brought out. And many therapists, who are not psychodynamicist, still accepted that idea. That is, these premises slide into the field and people accept them without, uh, thinking them through sometimes. So the therapist will be trained to ask people how they feel, on the assumption that's going to bring out repressed feelings, and that's good for people. So there's a whole series of premises in, in any simple thing that one does. At any rate, that was a powerful movement because of Freud's ability to organize, as well as write so well, and, uh, present his ideas so well it, that it, it really, uh, had a tremendous effect on a field that's still there. And one of the ways it's still there is your supervisor's been trained in those ideas. And I think, one of the things that happen is, supervisors change more slowly than therapists out in the field. So the therapists out in the field are meeting problems, which the supervisors were not trained to deal with. The, certainly, they weren't trained to give directives. So they have, a, a problem if the therapist says, "What'd I do with this guy who's beating his wife?" and the supervisor comes from a tradition where he would say, "Why is that so upsetting to you?" or "Have you some issue in your personal life about beating her?" They didn't know what to do when a guy beats his wife, really. So they had to change the conversation into a different direction. At any rate, those ideas are still around, as we all know, and you have to pick and choose among 'em, um, what you'll take and what you won't take. Then there was another, that actually, uh, the tool that The Unconscious was developed with, was hypnosis. I think almost all therapy comes out of hypnosis, and, certainly, Freud came out of that. There was another one, uh, whole set of ideas that came from Pavlov, who was also a hypnotist. And that's where the Behavior Therapist came from and it had a totally different set premises. If you were around in the 1950's, which not a lot of people still were. They, uh, it was interesting to see how different the premises were when, when Behavior Therapy appeared and Family Therapy appeared. But the behaviorist, uh, didn't make any interpretations. They didn't assume it was a repressed unconscious. They gave directives. They weren't nondirective. They felt a therapist should be responsible for the results. They, uh, emphasized reinforcements in changing them. But they didn't assume, if a person understands himself he'll change, though they did some training in learning. So you could have, and still can, two therapist in a mental health agency, side by side in rooms with similar patients, with totally different approaches. The, the therapy is, is based on different premises and involves different actions. You, you know, I saw this effectiveness one time. When you're older you do, uh, see some changes in therapy. Years ago I was on Gregory Bateson's project on communication and we were in a VA Hospital where we were housed, and there was a, uh, a, a lunch session every week of the people doing research. They would come and everybody would gather at lunch, and people would present what they were doing in research. And they, uh, staff at the VA Hospital there, were all analysts with an elderly analyst as the director of training and they would come to these research lunches to get wiser. And there were two young men in the same building we were in, who said they had a new idea. And they said, uh, they wanted to present it, so they did. And they said that, uh, there'd been a, they didn't put it this way, but somebody had the idea that the reinforcements that you use with animals could be applied to human beings, and that you could use the therapist as one of the reinforcements. Seems kind of obvious but it wasn't that obvious in those days. That was a tremendous jump, really, from positively reinforcing rats to doing it with a client. At any rate, they said, uh, That if you had a patient and you want him to behave in a certain way, like you want him to express his emotions more, what you do is every time he expresses something emotional you nod and you smile, and when he doesn't express something emotional you don't respond. And they said if you do that, in an hour you'll have a very emotional patient. And I remember the director training, of training getting angry at this. He said, "This is the behavior of cad. Uh, That it's totally improper to deliberately try to change somebody's behavior and particularly do it outside their awareness, when they don't know that's what you're doing, that's wrong." And I remember one of the young men saying, uh, "Well, you do it anyhow." If a patient does what you like, you tend to nod and smile, if they don't you don't respond. And the Director of Training said, uh, "If you do it and you don't know you're doing it it's alright." But that's, uh, a situation that's not uncommon now. That, uh, there's still objections to giving directives to change people outside their awareness and it's one of the ethical decisions that all of you have to make, whether you'll do that or you won't do that. Then as these issues don't go away, there was another approach that came out of the Nineteenth Century that I think is best represented by Milton Erickson. It's a, it's an approach that used hypnosis, naturally, and, uh, it looks like The Unconscious divided about 1900, between those who said it was full of awful ideas and those who said it was a positive force and that if you got out of the way of your unconscious it would, you would do a lot better, letting it do it. And that was the view represented by the hypnotist of, around Erickson. It was that, uh, the unconscious was powerful and it was powerful in a positive way. Erickson would even say, that if he misplaced an article he wouldn't hunt for it, he figured his unconscious misplaced it and it would come out when it was time. I mean, that's a confidence he'd had. It's the difference between a supervisor who will say to a, a trainee therapist, "Follow your impulses in there with the family" and one who will say, "My God, don't follow your impulses because heaven knows what kind of impulses you're gonna have." There, those are two different philosophies of life, really. But that positive unconscious idea came, uh, around a form of therapy that, that came out of hypnosis, which was that the therapist was responsible for a change. That the therapist got very personally involved in order to get people to do things. It didn't assume that inside, our interpretations should be used and it had a positive unconscious. One of the things about this approach is it, uh, got tied up with family therapy and the big changes it came with that id-, those, that set of ideas. And, uh, it began to be, uh, assumed that you should change one person to change another. That if you wanted to change a child you should change the mother. That, it, it's like shooting pool in away, that you, you hit one ball to hit another ball, in a way. And, uh, what began to be noticed at that time was that people live in organizations and individual therapy ignored this, really, and wouldn't, ah, the, like the dynamists, the pyschodynamists wouldn't even talk to a relative on the telephone, far less meet with them. And the idea that you should bring the family together or the people are responding to their social situations was really the basis of family therapy. I don't know if people realize how revolutionary that was at that time. It was, uh, it was this, that up until the 1950's any symptom was caused by the past and had no function in the present. It was an irrational something carried over from childhood. In the 1950's with the family approach, it began to be argued the symptoms are appropriate behaviors. They're adaptive behavior to that situation and in order to change things you've got to change the situation. So you have to change the nature of the hospital or the nature of the family or the workgroup if you're going to change the individual. And that's, uh, that was a revolutionary set of ideas and still is, I think. It's one where, um, where you have to think about a person's problems as being a minimum of two people. And, uh, you know, the way Gregory Bateson used to put it, is, is the mind is outside the individual. It's in the social group. So that, uh, there was a confusion of what's an individual and what's a social group, developing at that time, that we're still struggling with, I think. But at any rate, the ,uh, there were other ideas about there being premises that you have to investigate that came in this century and one was Systems Theory, which came out of cybernetics in the 1940's, and it, uh, assumes that what a person does is a response to what somebody else does, and that was a revolutionary idea. I mean, it would, it, it's at most elemental form, if a husband went too far the wife reacted. If the wife went too far the husband reacted. If they both went too far the kid reacted and that actions of a family were stabilizing the system. It's really a theory of a correct, self-corrective system. It's not a good theory for change. It's how not to change, is what Systems Theory is. It's a governed system, really. But there, uh, there were another couple of ideas that came out this century. One was the idea that people are in a family life cycle. That there's stages of family life and the psychological problems don't occur randomly. They cluster at certain points in life, like you have problems right after marriage, often, and with the birth of a child you have big problems. And then when the kid starts school, and then the period of adolescence, which I'll emphasize some today. And then a period of leaving home and then a retirement and old age, which is lasting forever now. We have, uh, a couple who were married 64 years ago and they came in with a marital problem. So, uh, those of you who think those problems are going away in time, uh, they might not go away. But, uh, everybody's adapting to how to deal with, uh, with people who are just so old that we haven't had experience with them. I mean, we had a 56 year old father dealing with his father and he said "How should I fix a 56 year man dealing with his father?" Nobody knows how he should deal with his father. So, uh, we're working it out, little by little. One of the ways to think about the family life cycle is that people can develop problems at a certain stage and the goal of therapy is to get 'em beyond that stage. That is, if a woman gets depressed when she has a baby, if your goal is her, you think about helping her understand what was depressing about becoming a mother. If you're thinking about in the stages of life, you think your goal is to get her home taking care of that baby properly, like any other mother would be home taking care of her baby. So you get her past the having birth stage into the next stage. When a kid won't start school, you organize to get him in school to get past that stage. One of the more ambiguous stages is adolescence because it doesn't have a clear point of beginning or a clear ending and it, it's uncertain what the purpose of it is. But it seems to me, to, uh, to prepare people for leaving home. That there's two things that you have to be able to do to leave your house and leave your home. One is you have to be able to support yourself and the other is you have to have a social base outside the home that you can go to, like a boyfriend or a group or whatever. Most adolescence problems focus on those two areas. The kids won't make a living, won't go to school, won't learn and so they're incapable of living on their own or they get involved with the wrong sort of people or don't have the social base outside the family. So they can't leave and they just stay home. And those are the two main areas that you work on with adolescence. But they have a, they have a purpose, which is only preparing for the next stage, really. And the really difficult stage is leaving home. I think they, the most severe problems, like psychosis occurs when somebody comes into the family and when somebody goes out of the family. So you get 'em with birth of children and you get it with people leaving home, which is a hard problem for everybody. Now, there's another set of ideas in this century that I think people are just adapting to, it's so recent, and that is the, the idea that therapy can be compulsory. Because all the therapy theories you were taught were based on the voluntary patient, the one who said, "Will you help me and I'll be glad to pay you some money to help." With Compulsory Therapy the courts are ordering people into therapy and that's a different kind of thing all together because the people aren't asking for help. They often don't want help. They're just there to keep out of jail or something worse. And that's a different therapy. As an example, we had a young woman who dealt with a family with, I think it was a delinquent kid, whose court case was coming up and she brought in the whole family and they worked together very well, and got organized, were very positive with her about this experience. And the kid went to court, and they had an appointment the next day to discuss what happened and the family didn't show up, and the kid got off. And then, when she called the family to have 'em come in and they said, they didn't need therapy, and she realized she'd been used, that the family had come in to get the kid off. That's the only reason they came in to therapy and it made her bitter. It took a supervisory job to help her be more cheerful again. Because she felt betrayed, you know, and it makes you uncertain with the next client and that's not a good way to work, where you, where you're not sure of basic issues. At any rate, Compulsory Therapy is not very common. It may be a third of the cases in the country for sex abuse cases, drug abuse cases, violence. The courts have discovered therapists and they're using therapists and therapists are letting themselves be used, is the curious thing. That is one of the one to think about it, is that you, as the therapist, you're always the agent of somebody. It used to be you were the agent of the individual and you were with the individual against the family. Then in the 60's, it began to be you were an agent of the family again, and, uh, against the community, helping people deal with the community. But with this system, you're an agent of the state and the state is using you to quiet trouble-makers, is what is happening. And there's not only individual cases but there's agencies, which are entirely full of compulsory cases, and people are forced into therapy, really. And, uh, that's a new thing in the world and it has, it has special problems. For example, most therapists in, evolving, with families have, have worked into a kind of Systems Theory in which they, they don't have a villain and they don't have a victim. They have a collaboration that creates the situation. But the courts have to have a villain because they have to have a person who has to be punished for doing wrong. And, uh, that linear way of thinking many therapists have been trying to get away from and they have to think that way to deal with the court because that's the way the court thinks, and it's a special problem. It's, it's one which, uh, is increasing and nobody knows, really, if therapy causes less recidivism then going to jail does. They just know that going to jail doesn't seem to solve these problems so maybe therapy will. But you'd think that the therapist would strike over this or something but they don't. They just accept these clients and do what they can with them, and each, each therapist has to find a way to work with people who don't want to be there. I mean, as an example, uh, we had a guy who came in with his wife, arrested for smoking, uh, might have been marijuana, but at any rate, uh, the therapist said, "Would you like help getting over this addiction?" and he said, "No," and he said "I've smoked this for years, uh, and I enjoy it, and I'm on urine tests now and I won't do it but as soon as that's over I'll do it again." So the therapist said to the wife, looked for some kind of way to motivate this guy to go through a change. Oh, it's PCP cuz I remember the therapist said, "You realize PCP is one of the few drugs that causes brain damage?" and the young man said, "I haven't seen any brain damage." And, uh, so he, then the therapist tried for the wife saying, "Would you prefer he didn't smoke this?" and the guy says, "She smokes it with me, like more than I do." So he, there's no leverage for, they're there because the court told 'em to go there and put in a certain length of time, that's all. I remember the, the wife said, uh, that she was a little concerned. She wanted a baby and she was concerned about the effect of PCP on the baby. So the therapist looked delighted and he came out behind the mirror and had to get a pamphlet and this stuff and he brought it in to her, the pamphlet on, on the unfortunate effects of drug use on the fetus. And, uh, he said, "You certainly shouldn't be smoking this if you're going to get pregnant." And the guy said, "Oh, I don't think I want a baby" and there we were. But everybody has to find a way to work with them and motivate them or see them or set some rules for, uh, what they'll do in relation to the court. And your also into the problems of what's confidential because confidentially, uh, confidentiality can become an issue on what, uh, rights that the courts have to know what you, uh, talking about with a client. We tend to recommend that the, you can report that the person came there and you can give recommendations but what happened between you is really up to you. But there's no rules for that, between therapist and the court. There's, there's no agreements that have been made to clarify many of these issues. So it's a, it's an interesting time, where you're even having therapy with people who don't want to be there. But if you're going to, uh, if the, you're going to think about it the best therapy for you to have, for you to do, the ideas, uh, are important. I think you have to, uh, choose the theory that you'll accept for yourself, and that will apply to most cases. I think it's best to realize that there's no truth. That we used to think that there was a truth out there. That, that if a person, uh, was depressed, there was a truth about why there were depressed and that you had to find that out before you could do anything about 'em being depressed, or if a person had a symptom of any kind. And I think it's better to think about what set of ideas will help you help people, independent of whether they're true or not. But you need, uh, to have a theory that leads to a variety of operations. That a method doesn't work anymore. It used to be, that the method worked for middle class people who came, spent their time and spent their money and said the right things and so on. But, now you have lower class and upper class and so many ethnic groups that any straight forward method isn't gonna work with them much. You've got a Muslim in trouble with his third wife; you're not able to do marital therapy like you would with a college couple. There's tremendous variety out there now. In, near us in, uh, public high school they had multicultural day, where all the kids came in their national costumes and there were 180 cultural groups represented, and a lot of those end up in therapy. So a therapist has to be able to deal with that variety of people these days. So there's no simple set of operations or simple theory that is going to do it. You have to be able to adapt your therapy. Really what you're doing is creating a therapy for each case, because each case is different. You can't get the people to fit your method. You've gotta, uh, get your approach to fit the people. I think, uh, one of the things you should abandon is the theory of diagnosis, the DSM Forum because you need a positive view of your clients and that is not a positive view of people. I don't think you'd want any friends who could be described in that manual. You wouldn't wanna hang out with people like that. And, so to diagnose somebody like that and then spend all your time trying to help them is hard because you don't like 'em to start with. And it's better to just drop them, I think. It's, it's good for institutions and for various purposes but it's not good for therapy. We need a therapy diagnosis that gives you a guide in what to do. I think the behaviorists were helpful with that. If you say, "A kid has a school phobia," you don't know what to do with that. If you say, "The kid has a school avoidance problem," then you obviously have something you can do to help that kid not avoid school. I mean, it gives you some guidance to some action. And the traditional diagnosis doesn't really help at all in, in fact it can interfere. I think it's also helpful not to have a Research Theory because it's just too complicated to, er, think about cases in terms of the research issues or as training for doing therapy. To, to go through psychology research training, I don't think it's helpful. It isn't too clear what type of training is helpful but a researcher, for example, is supposed to not contaminate his data in anyway and that's what you do in therapy is you're into the data and trying to change it. A researcher, he, he or she, has to, uh, stay neutral and distant from what the material is and in therapy you don't want 'em to stay distant, you want 'em involved, at least if you have that approach. So research is not a very good training but it, it isn't clear that we have people who had trained in psychiatry to do therapy, people trained in social work, people trained in psychology and the trainings are totally different and based on totally different premises, and, uh, yet somehow they're all doing therapy and all sure the way they were trained was the right way. That's a curious time. But at any rate, uh, I think you need a, a certain, you have to make some decisions that, uh, of how you're gonna work. That is, you have no choice in the matter. For example, you have to think of what unit you're going to think in if a problem comes in. Is it going to be a unit of one person or two people or three people or more people? If, uh, if a woman comes in and she's so anxious she can't even have the door of the room closed, and you have to explain her, you can explain in terms of her, her and her problem is in her anxiety. You could also, if you wanted, uh, have a theory that, uh, she's married and that her contract with her husband is that she has something wrong with her and he'd help her and therefore, she's got to have some anxieties so he can reassure her and help her. And then you have a two person description, it's the same woman or you could have a description that she's caught between her mother and her husband because they don't like each other and her mother wants her to leave her husband and she gets anxious caught in this triangle. It's the same woman but your unit is larger when you go to three. One of the things I think is helpful is, is a three person unit because you can have Coalition Theory then. You can have two against one, which you can't have with two people or one people. If you think of marriage therapy as involving a third person, either you the therapist or a mother in-law or a kid. If you think in triangles you work with marriages differently. Really Family Therapy was, uh, the introduction of a third person into marital therapy and the realizations that people were responding to the the therapist not to just each other. But at any rate, you have to make, you have to decide on a unit, uh, and, uh you have no choice in that because whatever you do is gonna, uh, be a premise involving how many people are involved. You also have to decide whether you're going to focus on a problem or not. Some people feel you should focus on the problem. Some people feel you should focus on what's behind it or around it or near it or a different kind of thing. I think that you get much more cooperation from people if you focus on the problem. That's what they came in to get over and it used to be, people say, uh, "Well a problem isn't important, let's deal with what's behind it, the roots," but I think they did that because they didn't know what to do with the problems and they were better on the theory what was behind them. I think if you know what to do with problems and you focus on them you get a lot more cooperation. One of the things we used to do in Family Therapy was try to save children. A family would come in and say, "This kid is the whole problem," and the therapist would say, "Well maybe so but this kid over here looks kind of strange and this one is odd too and your marriage looks pretty shaky," and then they would ask the family to do something and they would get a lot of resistance. And it seems better to agree with them, this kid is the whole problem and therefore, certain things have to done, and you reorganize the family and save the kid that way. Because if you just, uh, agree with them only and, I mean, it's especial, it's, it's the same with a symptom as it is with a kid. Whatever they come in with, I think it's best to focus on that. In fact, was ask on, uh, when they call in, "What's the problem?" and a surprising number of 'em would state a problem, which we can then focus upon. At any rate, you have to make a decision, whether you're going to start with a genogram or you're going to start with what brings you here today. I don't think, uh, taking social history is a good idea with clients. It teaches them this is a history-taking process therapy and then they get, uh, uncertain when you begin to tell 'em what to do later or you change your approach. I think it's better to, uh, gather your information during the interview, which means, you're always working with less information than you'd like to have but it comes up in the, in the context of an interview in a way that's more useful. To discover they have an uncle who supports the family, for example. It's better to have it come out in session rather than a history taking way. There's another issue that everybody has to think about and decide upon, and that's whether to think in a hierarchy or not. You can think in terms of everybody being part of an organization and that's a crucial part of their lives or you can think of individuals living with each other, each one an individual and, uh, if you do it that way you don't think in terms of one person having higher status or power than the other. I think it's best to think hierarchically, particularly when you have colleagues involved in a case. That the, that is if you think about a hierarchy in which there's experts at the top because the family calls upon them for help, then you have grandparents and parents and children, and a hierarchy among the children, that those people have different status, different power, different authority. Often the grandparents in this culture don't have that much authority but if you're dealing with an Asian family, they do have. So you have to treat the grandparents differently, I think. But if you think that way, you don't have to think that way, there are people who sit down with the family in a very democratic family where everybody's equals in this conversation. And I think it's better to, uh, think hierarchically and the first thing you do when you get a case is think who else is, what a, what colleague is involved with this case, who has more power than I do. For example, we had a, a family which the father sex abused his son and, uh, they were in therapy for about three months, with things progressing it looked like it was solved when the father was suddenly taken out of the home by protective services without the permission of the therapist and it wasn't that they had new information, it was that they just got caught up on their paper work, really. And, you have to know when you begin, what power people, colleagues have in this case and, uh, can you get it, yourself designated so that somebody's not medicated without your permission or hospitalized without your permission. There's kids taken out of the homes these days without the therapists permission and you have to either go through a life of disappointment or work this out when you first get on a, first get a case, if you think hierarchically. If you don't think hierarchically then you don't need to do that. If you think hierarchically and a family comes in, you're into the question who do you ask about the problem because whoever you ask you're designating as the authority on the problem, if you think that way. You know, I was once training a guy named Gerald, was seeing a father, mother and a delinquent boy, and I was behind a mirror and watching them and I called him out and I said, uh, "I'm supposed to be your, supervisor of you and I don't know what you're doing. What's your plan?" and he said, "You just watch," and he went back in with 'em. So, uh, so I watched awhile and then I called him out again and I said, "I've been watching. I still don't know what you're doing," and he said, "I'm nudging the father," and I said, "What do you mean nudging the father?" and he said, "Well this fathers been out of it and the mother had the responsibility of this kid and I would like the father more involved so I'm building him up, and I'm nudging him," and I said, "What is nudging?", and he said, uh, "Well I'm nudging him higher." He said, "Whenever father speaks I pay attention. When mother or son speak I don't pay so much attention." I said, and he said, "You just watch." So he went in the room and I watched and I could see this father rising in status as the therapist paid so much attention to him. And, uh, you think that way if you think hierarchically, that, that you have a laying on of hands power. That whoever you listen to rises in authority whether you like it or not. I mean, you may want to be sympathizing with an adolescent daughter but the more you listen to her and pay attention to her the more she's rising in authority in the family, which you may or may not want. If you think that way, you have a choice. There's another, perhaps the most important one is, uh, you have to have a Theory of Motivation. You have to think why do people do what they do? There's even some argument that the brain, people say there's, uh, a nudgual of the brain, which is devoted to explaining why people do what they do. That this is a compulsion you have to explain. That if somebody jumps up down here, everybody here has to have an explanation, why did they do that? You can't just let it go. An important thing is to have a, in therapy, a motivation that helps you do therapy. It gives you some guide lines. And I think, uh, the Theory of Repression is probably the worst theory that ever came along for therapist, on why people do what they do. That it's really much better to think the problem is the people help each other and they help each other by harming themselves, and that's a problem. That's the motivation, for example, if you see a wife yelling at her husband and you wonder, "Why does she yell at her husband, it only makes it worse for her?" You can have a theory that she yells at her husband because she has hostile feelings toward him or toward men kind in general. And, uh, that's a possible explanation. You could also watch what happens to her husband if she doesn't have him around, and what you notice is he sort of drifts away, that, uh, he goes into some kind of a depressed state. Then she yells at him and he comes out of it, he knows what's wrong, it's her, and that stabilizes him. So you see her as being helpful, doing a positive thing, and if you see her that way, you can work with that woman much better than if you see her full of hostility, anger and all that. I think with adolescents it's much better to think of them as helping parents. Even by hitting a parent, they're helping a parent. It's the best way to think. What I'm talking about is, what's the best motivation to have in therapy? It doesn't mean you'd have the same motivation for the people out in the street. I mean, therapy is a very special place. But if you see a, a daughter threating suicide you can assume that this is some inner-nature problem of hers or you can see that as stabilizing the parents, that she does this when the parents start to split, and that this is a positive way of working. If you can have that theory you have a much better acquaintance with your, with your clientele because you're, you're thinking of a, of a adolescent as not a pain in the ass but as co-therapist, really, who's not doing it well. They tend to harm themselves as a way of being helpful and one of the things you can think about is how could they get, you could get them to be helpful without harming themselves, and, uh, there's ways to do it. You could make contracts with them. As an example, kind of a bizarre one, there was a young woman, bulimic who was dying, she was starving, really, and she wouldn't even come in, and her parents came in. She wouldn't come out of her room. So the therapist went to the home and saw the parents, and discovered that father was dying of a heart attack or he, he was, had a serious heart problem and wasn't supposed to drink and he was drinking and that was going to kill him. So the therapist was out in the hall with the father, with a heart problem, and the daughter in the room unwilling to come out starving to death. So with the help of the supervisor, "Would you stop drinking if your daughter eats?" and he said, "Yes." They made that contract, and the daughter started eating and the father stopped drinking. And the, the daughter never did come in. The parents came in and reported on her progress. And she, uh, she was a very serious anorexia girl, and she gained weight. But that is based on the assumption that she was being helpful and the father was being helpful but they're being helpful in the wrong way, and that they needed some guidance in being helpful in a positive way. Because I think often a daughter goes through some extreme thing, um, which you can hypothesize is either to stabilize the marriage or to pull depressed parents out of a state because they have to come out of it to deal with the daughter. But you need a Theory of Motivation and you better choose one that gives you the best way of working as a therapist. It's a, let me talk about a way of doing therapy, if, if you choose certain premises, if you assume the basic unit is two or more people, preferably three. That you focus on the problem. That you think hierarchically, and that you have a motivation that people are positively achieving ends for their symptoms. Then you have a certain way of working. It's important to choose a way and not to mix your premises. For example, uh, if you see that a daughter is harming herself to help the parents sometimes you'd be tempted, if your insightful, to say to the parents, "I, I think your daughter is harming herself to help you." This is a grave error, really, because what's gonna happen is the parents are gonna get upset at the fact their marriage is so bad off that their daughter has to harm herself to help them. As they get more upset the girl's gonna escalate to help them. So you're gonna produce the very problem you're trying to get rid of by being insightful and explaining things to people. You have to decide whether you're gonna explain everything to the clientele or you're gonna have your own way of working that your premises, and you, uh, don't explain to them but you have to decide about that. I think it's, to mix insight and directives is not a good idea. Actually I think if people, if you give people insight, make interpretations they'll get even with you. Nobody really likes that. One of the ways they'll get even is by staying with you forever. That they'll never go away and I think it saves you so much, uh, work and effort if you just don't make interpretations, you know. You, uh, unless it's, unless it's a family that is dedicated to interpretation, that's had a lot therapy. If, if you have New York family, you've got to make interpretations but you don't do it on the assumptions this will change them. You do it on the assumption this is a way of joining them in order to get them to do something. So I think it's just better to drop that.
