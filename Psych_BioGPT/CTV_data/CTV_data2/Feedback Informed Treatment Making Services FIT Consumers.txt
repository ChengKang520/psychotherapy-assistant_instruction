The Evolution of Psychotherapy Feedback Informed Treatment: A Demonstration Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. International Center for Clinical Excellence 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Is it that time, it's 10:40 and you are here at a demonstration of Feedback Informed Treatment. I'm grateful that you showed up. And I hope to illustrate together with my colleague, Bob Bertolino, uhm, who is a professor at Maryville University and St. Louis and one of the ICCE. That is the International Center for Clinical Excellence, ah, Senior Associates. Bob is also the person who edited the manuals, the FIT or Feedback Informed Treatment manuals together with the number of other people that are here in the audience that lay out how to incorporate feedback into your work. So, I thought I would start by doing a brief introduction to feedback informed work, and then, Bob has graciously agreed to, ah, work with me as if you were a client filling out the measures. And then, if there's any time left at the end, ah, we'll have you come up to the microphone and ask. Sound like a deal? 

00:00:55
 Yep. 

00:00:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy Feedback Informed Treatment: A Demonstration Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. International Center for Clinical Excellence 2013 ANAHEIM Feedback Informed Treatment FIT is a pantheoretical approach for evaluating and improving the quality and effectiveness of behavioral health services. It involves routinely and formally soliciting feedback from consumers regarding the alliance and outcome of care and using the resulting information to inform and tailor service delivery. 

00:00:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. So if we can go back into the slides for a minute, uhm, this is the demonstration of feedback informed work. What is FIT? FIT is a pantheoretical approach for evaluating and improving the quality and outcome, ah-- quality and the effectiveness of behavioral health services. Essentially, it involves routinely and formally soliciting feedback from consumers regarding the alliance and the outcome of care and then using the resulting information to inform and tailor service delivery. So, it's not associated with a particular way of working or model and it is not a treatment model. We don't have a way of thinking about how change happens. Nearly, it's a way for evaluating whatever method you might use to find out, is your client engage in the process and is that ga-- engagement process leading, ah, to improvement in their lives. 

00:01:50
Feedback Informed Treatment FIT is not only consistent with but operationalize the American Psychological Association's (APA) definition of evidence-based practice. To wit, FIT involves, "The integration of the best available research...and monitoring of patient progress (and of changes in the patient's circumstances — e.g. job loss, major illness) that may suggest the need to adjust the treatment...(e.g., problems in the therapeutic relationship or in the implementation of the goals of the treatment)" (p273, 276-277) 

00:01:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, one more time back to the slides. And FIT, we say, is not only consistent with but operationalize. This is the definition of evidence-based practice. There is a lot of talk about evidence-based practices outside these walls and of course, at this conference. Exactly, what is it? People who develop models are inclined to treat that term as a noun, as if an evidence-based practice is a model that they practice. That is not any recognized definition of what evidence-based practice is. Evidence-based practice according to APA is definition which is the same by the way as the, ah, Institute of Medicine which is the same in many places outside of United States, Canada, and Europe. Ah, FIT involves the integration of the best available research. What do we know? Early change in treatment is a good predictor of change throughout the treatment process. What else do we know? Engagement, one of the best predictors of treatment outcome. What, ah, predicts client engagement? What predicts client engagement is the alliance. The best integration of the best available research and monitoring of patient's progress and of changes of patient's circumstances such as job loss or major illness that may suggest the need to adjust the treatment. Well, what do you adjust if you're going to adjust the treatment? Look at the definition. Again, this is straight out of APA's definition which was published in May 2006 in the American Psychologists. And it says, "problems in the therapeutic relationship or in the implementation of the goals of the treatment." That is evidence-based practice. In other words, evidence-based practice is a verb, not a noun. Ah, and what we have to do is monitor and measure to make sure that our clients are getting what they came for in the treatment process. Our particular way of doing FIT which was approved in February by SAMSHA as a evidence-based practice, you can see that if you go to the samsha.gov website and search for the partners for change, ah, ah, Outcome Management System International Center for Clinical Excellence version. 

00:03:50
The Evidence •Currently, 13 RCT's involving 12,374 clinically, culturally, and economically diverse consumers: •Routine outcome monitoring and feedback as much as doubles the "effect size" (reliable and clinically significant change); •Decreases drop-out rates by as much as half; •Decreases deterioration by 33%; •Reduces hospitalizations and shortened length of stay by 66%; •Significantly reduced cost of care (non-feedback groups increased). www.scottdmiller.com/performance-metrics Overall: (General o well-being) Individually: (Political well-being) Interpersonally: (Family and relationships) Socially: (Work, School, Friendships) The O.R.S Relationship: I felt heard, understood, and respected. We did NOT work on or talk about what. I wanted to work on and talk about. Goals and Topics: We worked on and talked about. The therapist's approach is NOT a good fit for me. Approach or Method: The therapist's approach IS a good fit for me. The S.R.S 

00:03:50
SCOTT D. MILLER We now have about 13 randomized clinical trials, thousands of culturally, economically diverse clients. What we find is that routinely, outcome-- routine outcome monitoring and feedback as much as doubles the effect size of the services individual providers, ah, gift. Number two, it decreases drop-out rates by about half. Number three, it decreases deterion-- deterioration rates by about of 33 for simply monitoring the outcome and the alliance over your care and then discussing it with your clients. Number four, reduces hospitalizations and shortened length of stay by about two-thirds. And last but not least, significantly reduces the cost of care compared to non-feedback groups in the randomized clinical trials. So, I think there's fairly good news about incorporating some way of monitoring the outcome and alliance in care our particular way. And it is just one way there are other groups that have measures, ah, as well. I am not suggesting our measures are the best measures ever on the planet. I will tell you this. They are free, uhm, and you can get them-- thank you, ma'am. Ah, you can get them on my website at scottdmiller.com/performance-metrics. We do ask that you complete, ah, and agree to the terms of a licensing condition. Ah, that license basically says if you do something silly with the measures, I don't know, rolling the map into little doobies and smoke with them with your client. Ah, you know, that shits on you. Uhm, what we give you in exchanges the measure. Ah, ah, and you can get them again on the website. When you use the measures, you can use them on paper and pencil format or you can get fancy and use an electronic program. There are variety of once I licensed measures to a number of groups that do that. And when you do that, you can actually feedback about your effectiveness. Let me just switch the slide deck here and show you, uhm, what this might look like. So, you would get data that sums up your clients and gives you in-- information about how many clients, you're seeing the numbers of sessions, the average number of sessions, treatment length, uhm, and if you look s-- look all the way down forward as relative effect size. It's going to compare how effective you are to other clinicians in our database. Ah, so, you-- that's right. Isn't that some scary stuff right there? Yeah. It's, ah, it's better to live in denial. Ah, and, and, and think you're effective and attend lots of CE events then, they really know, ah, how effective we are. Here's the good news. Most of you will find as I find that we're average. And that's very good. As you've heard me say in other presentations, average treat to client in the U.S. at least in the research that we have is better off than 80% of the untreated sample. So, on that relative effect size line, if you're hitting right about zero. Uhm, that means you are average. If you're slightly lower than that, it means one of two things. There are not enough cases in the system yet to give you an accurate view of your effectiveness, or number two, you now know where your edge of professional development life. This is a place where you can go to work and try to improve both engagement and outcome of the client you see. How can you do that? 

00:07:15
Putting Data to Work 

00:07:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, what you're going to do is, ah, get some kind of graph that compare your client's progress, your individual client's progress to help people like them to progress over time. This isn't fixed in stone, it's merely a jumping off point. A place to discuss with your client. If clients are scoring in the green zone, then they are scoring more like the people who end their work-- your work with you successfully. Uhm, if they're scoring in the red zone, then at that particular time, they're scoring more like the people who end unsuccessfully which gives you and the client a crucial opportunity to adjust what you're doing. Make sense? Many of you are talking about this in detail on Sunday in a two-hour workshop on Feedback Informed Treatment. In the meanwhile, what I'd like to do is, ah, move into just a brief demonstration of some key skills that we think, ah, you should have if you are going to begin using outcome measurement. So, uhm, one of those key skills is about introducing the measures in trying to engage the client in the process of filling out the forms. Seems like it should be quite simple because, of course, there are only four questions and yet what we find is most of the difficulties that arise when doing feedback informed work take place in that first crucial two or three minutes when the therapist is trying to invite the client into giving feedback both about their progress and their outcome. So, Bob has volunteered to act as if this is our first visit and I'm going to ask him to fill out the form. Afterwards, I'll stop and point out the various, ah, things I said that we think are crucial to say when you introduce the form. All right. Bob. Please call me Scott. 

00:09:05
BOB BERTOLINO Nice to meet you, Scott. 

00:09:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, welcome here. 

00:09:10
BOB BERTOLINO Thank you. 

00:09:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, you know, we work a little bit differently, ah, than you may be accustomed to. I don't know. Have you, have you had an experience been in therapy before? 

00:09:20
BOB BERTOLINO Uhm, no. This is my first time. 

00:09:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay, good. Uhm, then let me just explain to you how the process works for us. Uhm, we want to make sure when you come to see us that you're getting what you want. And so, each time you come, I'd like to ask you to fill out a brief measurement tool. And this tool sort of tells me whether or not the things we're doing together are actually helping. It's based on how you experience things outside of the office. Does this make sense? 

00:09:50
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:50
SCOTT D. MILLER And so, the form actually asks you to look back over the last week including today and then mark-- and make a mark on four different lines. Individually, how things are going for you personally. Interpersonally, in your relationships and generally that means close relationships, family, loved ones, things like that. Socially, work, if you were in school, friendships, more outside the home. And then kind of an overall catch-all category, uhm, just how are things, maybe an average of the first three, could be something that we don't ask about. Does this make sense? 

00:10:35
BOB BERTOLINO So, uhm, to the left side means I feel worse - 

00:10:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:10:40
BOB BERTOLINO - or not so good - 

00:10:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes. 

00:10:40
BOB BERTOLINO - or-- okay. Right. 

00:10:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. And so, this cursor, we'll just move it right here and you can put a mark anywhere along this line. Low score to the left, high scores to the right. 

00:10:50
BOB BERTOLINO Okay. 

00:10:50
SCOTT D. MILLER And here's what we know about this kind of work. If what I know is going to be of help of you then you should see signs of that sooner rather than later. This doesn't have to take years in order to be helpful. Weeks is when you should start seeing something is happening. If it does, we can keep going. No limits. I'll see you for as long as you like. Sort of like is your dentist in a way. 

00:11:20
BOB BERTOLINO Okay. 

00:11:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Right? Uhm, you can come and have check-ups, etcetera. Uhm, however, if it's not working, then I will change and adjust and adapt to try to make a better fit, ah, and see if I can find something more to do. If that doesn't work, maybe we could discuss do we need to add something to this, additional kinds of services, talk to other people, attend to group potentially. And last but not least, sometimes-- often-- but sometimes, you know, I just don't-- I just-- I'm not the right person. I just don't know the thing that will help you. In that case, when that does happen, I promise I work with you to find some place or someone that can be of more help. Does it make sense? 

00:12:10
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. Yes. 

00:12:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Do you have any questions about that? 

00:12:10
BOB BERTOLINO Does everybody do this? 

00:12:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Eve-- does you mean therapists? 

00:12:15
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:12:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Not yet. But I, I do have plans. I think it's good when people like yourself ask that, ah-- ask, ah, ask how do-- how will we know if it's working, so I think that's an important part of it. And, you know, I don't know if you know but my, my profession as a psychologist to just actually ask people coming for services what prevents most from going. Seventy-eight percent, 78% say they are not sure it will work for them. And so, by having you fill this out, we're gonna see if it's, if it's working or not. And if it's not working, nothing to fear, we'll work it out. 

00:12:55
BOB BERTOLINO That's great cuz I'm not sure. 

00:13:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. You're not sure about of it working. 

00:13:00
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:13:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Well, let's try and see what happens. 

00:13:05
BOB BERTOLINO Okay. 

00:13:05
SCOTT D. MILLER And so, does this make sense to you then? 

00:13:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:13:05
SCOTT D. MILLER And all you need to do is just move this along the line and then you just, ah, left to click there. Good. Perfect. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:30
SCOTT D. MILLER There we go. And, does it feel about right if you look them over? 

00:13:35
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. Tha-- that looks right for me. 

00:13:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Here's the glue part. When I hit the done button here, ah, the computer, ah, gives us a signal and tells us how are things. And you've gotten the green signal. Ah, that green signal, if you read in the box is the client's score more like people who are, who are in and likely to benefit from clinical services. Begin treatment as usual. 

00:14:00
BOB BERTOLINO It's good. I mean, I'm crazy like everybody else. 

00:14:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Oh, well, I guess it could be viewed that way. Uhm, more, it basically says you're in the right place that there are some things that you would like to work on and try to saw it through. Make sense? 

00:14:15
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:14:15
SCOTT D. MILLER One other really nice aspect of this is it gives us a kind of a timeline about when those changes should happen. And if you look at the graphic here, you'll see if over time with our first score right here which looks like about an 18 or so, that blue line that cuts across the screen, if from visit to visit you're at or around that blue line, then we're on track. And if we're below that blue line around the red line, then we should talk about it and I should figure out what more I need to do. Okay. Does it make sense? 

00:14:50
BOB BERTOLINO So I, I do this every time I come to see you? 

00:14:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yes, every time. Hopefully, in the beginning, we sit down chat, fill it out, and then we can talk about whether or not what we did last time made a difference for you. 

00:15:00
BOB BERTOLINO Okay. 

00:15:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Make sense? 

00:15:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:15:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. So, I did notice, Bob, that when looking just at the individual scores that the interpersonal item, that second one was a little bit lower than the rest. 

00:15:15
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:15:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Is that the place you'd like to start or some other place? 

00:15:20
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, I have a lot of trouble in my relationships so that-- that's really the biggest thing for me. 

00:15:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Perfect. We stop here? 

00:15:30
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:15:30
SCOTT D. MILLER You've seen us introduce and have the ORS scored. There were number of items that we said and Bob feel free to jump in here at anytime to comment on them. One was to simply invite them in by saying each week, we're going to monitor and measure the progress. I always say I work a little differently than you maybe accustomed to. Why? Because quite often, people have never done anything like this especially if they've been in services before. I then say, if what we do works then we can continue for as long as you like. So, if you're doing better from visit to visit, I'm not going to kick you out. This has nothing to do with manage care or insurance. When it's working, more services are better than fewer services. The third and last thing I say is that if what we do doesn't work, I'll do one of three things. I will adjust. Me. I will adjust, ah, in consultation with you about, ah, what we're doing here. The second thing is that als-- I'll try to discuss with you who else and what else we might should be doing. Do we need to, ah, add auxiliary services, additional services. And if that doesn't work around eight to 10 weeks or so into this process, then I'll work you to find someone else or someplace else to go. This is the introduction of the ORS. From there, I then noticed that when Bob filled out the measure that the scores in one particular area were lower. And I, I asked about that. Quite often, this simply indicates the client that we're already started. It makes a nice transition into a more traditional therapeutic conversation. That's the introduction. I ask you if you're going to begin using outcome tools, don't short-change the introduction. Please don't treat the ORS or whatever outcome to who you'll use as a bookend. The thing you do in the beginning then you do your magic, and then you do the other scale at the end. Rather, really take the time to introduce and engage the client in the process, ah, throughout using the measurement tools. Last, you saw the graph. And I'm going to show the client a graph at each and every visit much as you would if you saw your physician for high blood pressure. Is the medication working? Is the dietary and exercise routine actually resulting in the lowering of blood pressure? Are your scores in line with scores that are appropriate for you as a person if we're making progress? We then do our session. And when we do our session, uhm, we talk about whatever style you want to do and we're going to end our session by completing the SRS. Once again, let me just take a brief moment and introduce the SRS to Bob and then be can begin to filled questions if you have them. So, Bob. 

00:18:35
BOB BERTOLINO Scott. 

00:18:35
SCOTT D. MILLER You recall at the beginning of this session I said that we fill out these tools. You filled out one of them and I always like to end the conversation I have with people a second measure, a tool that, uhm, is a little bit different. This was, ah, this was about-- this is more about how would you felt like things went her between us. Uhm, whether or not you felt like I heard what you were saying that we identified what you want to work on and whether or not you feel like the approach fits for you, or something is missing. So, it's very simple like the last time. Four questions. But let me say before you fill it out that I'm not interested in perfect scores. A 10 out of 10 doesn't mean much to, to me really. Ah, life is not perfect and neither am I. You don't have to worry about hurting my feelings here. I'd really, I'd really like to know how was it for you. I guess I should say one other small thing. Sometimes, you may feel I was completely off, that happens on occasion, but most of the times, these are small things that you may think you know, it's not even woth mentioning. I'd like it if you mention it so that we can talk about it and decide that together. Does it make sense to you? 

00:20:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. Okay. 

00:20:05
Please rate today's session by discussing on the line nearest to the description that best fits your experience. I did NOT feel heard, understood, and respected. Relationship: I felt heard, understood, and respected. We did NOT work on or talk about what. I wanted to work on and talk about. Goals and Topics: We worked on and talked about. The therapist's approach is NOT a good fit for me. Approach or Method: The therapist's approach IS a good fit for me. There was something missing in the session today. Overall: Overall today's session was right for me. 

00:20:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. So, let me show you the scale. It's called the SRS or the Session Rating Scale. And again, it has four basic questions. The relationship and the scores go from negative to positive. So, I did not feel heard, understood, and respected and I did. Same for goals and topics. Did we cover what you hope to we would cover during our time together? And approach and method. Did it feel like it was a good fit or was there something missing that you were hoping for? And then last but not least is overall. Kind of a catch-all question. Does it make sense? 

00:20:45
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:20:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Would you be willing to do that? 

00:20:45
BOB BERTOLINO Yes. 

00:20:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:21:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. Great. So, you adjusted that last one. 

00:21:15
BOB BERTOLINO Uh-hmm. 

00:21:15
SCOTT D. MILLER At the last, was there something you were thinking about? 

00:21:15
BOB BERTOLINO Well, uhm, if I understand this-- I mean, I think overall you know, it, ah-- I felt like we-- we're really much-- we're really, uhm, in sync in terms of what was concerning me and you know, I, I definitely feel comfortable. Uhm, but I think initially because I, I kind of feel the way we're going about is this maybe not quite where I hope it would be. 

00:21:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:21:50
BOB BERTOLINO Uhm, I, I guess I initially thought maybe we were more off than, than I really think we are. So, uhm, I think overall I feel comfortable and this is good. 

00:22:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:22:10
BOB BERTOLINO So, it's just that one part. 

00:22:15
SCOTT D. MILLER So you felt like, initially, we were a-- we were off. Do you mean in-- initially in the beginning part of our conversation or here in the end you thought initially? 

00:22:20
BOB BERTOLINO I mean initially when I was thinking about it here. 

00:22:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:22:25
BOB BERTOLINO And like-- as I-- uhm, maybe it didn't go you know, cuz we were off in terms of how we were approaching it - 

00:22:30
BOB BERTOLINO Uh-hmm. 

00:22:30
SCOTT D. MILLER - but then, ah, I actually realized I, I do feel a little bit better and I feel more comfortable. 

00:22:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:22:35
BOB BERTOLINO So, that's great. Uhm, that's why I adjusted it up. 

00:22:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Good. So, it did feel like I heard and understood what you said? 

00:22:45
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:22:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, and somehow just talking about things oftentimes helps. 

00:22:50
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:22:50
SCOTT D. MILLER At the same time, it looks like you've given me really specific feedback as well. If we look at the marks here on goals and topics we're a little bit lower than we are in understanding. 

00:23:05
BOB BERTOLINO Uh-hmm. 

00:23:05
SCOTT D. MILLER And on the approach and the method, the way we work together today - 

00:23:10
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:23:10
SCOTT D. MILLER - it looks like you would have preferred something in addition to what we did. 

00:23:15
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, so - 

00:23:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:23:15
BOB BERTOLINO - I think we, we drifted a bit - 

00:23:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:23:20
BOB BERTOLINO - uhm, more than I was hoping. Ah, I wanted to talk a little bit more about my relationship and I felt like we, uhm, started to but then we moved into some other stuff. And - 

00:23:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:23:30
BOB BERTOLINO - so... 

00:23:30
SCOTT D. MILLER And so, we-- you would like to have talked more about the relationship, - 

00:23:35
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:23:35
SCOTT D. MILLER - what was going on your partner, - 

00:23:35
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:23:35
SCOTT D. MILLER - but somehow rather it ended up drifting. 

00:23:40
BOB BERTOLINO Right. 

00:23:40
SCOTT D. MILLER And would you like me to sort of like put aback or was-- or you're thinking maybe I sort of drifted in the things that I thought were interesting. Or, how do you think about that? 

00:23:50
BOB BERTOLINO Put it back. 

00:23:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Would you hope that I might structure and say, "Hey, Bob, let's get back on track? Or, are you were thinking, "Hey, Scott, why are you taking me off track?" 

00:23:55
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, I like kinda wonder. I thought you, you know, you knew what you're doing. 

00:24:05
SCOTT D. MILLER That, that is never a safe assumption. 

00:24:10
BOB BERTOLINO So, I, I kinda work with the flow. 

00:24:10
SCOTT D. MILLER This is really important, ah, for me what you've said, ah, because it tells me, ah, number one, I need to stay frosty and make sure that I'm not taken as off-track. It also sounds like you're giving me permission to ask in-- when we're working together in the future. Are we on the right track - 

00:24:25
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:24:25
SCOTT D. MILLER - during the visit? Ah, make sure that we're not drifting off into subjects that, that may not be as important - 

00:24:35
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:24:35
SCOTT D. MILLER - as what, ah, concern is about your partner. Is that correct? 

00:24:35
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:24:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Is there anything that we did here today or did not do these two pieces that might prevent you from coming back for a second time? 

00:24:50
BOB BERTOLINO Uhm, not now. I mean, not that-- I mean, we have a chance to talk about it, I think I probably would have gone out and thought a little bit more about it. Uhm, I, I think I would have made an appointment but I would have gone thought about it. 

00:25:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:25:00
BOB BERTOLINO A little bit more. 

00:25:00
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:25:00
BOB BERTOLINO This makes me feel better about it that you don't think that there's-- that you're interested in, in really what I have to say about this rather than you kinda feel like or this needs to go. 

00:25:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Absolutely. Uhm, and sometimes, I can get off on a tangent, ah, and I, ah, will be mindful of that in the future times that we work together. 

00:25:25
BOB BERTOLINO Oh, I haven't done this before so I don't really know what - 

00:25:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah, perfect. 

00:25:25
BOB BERTOLINO - what supposed to happen anyway. So, that helps. 

00:25:30
SCOTT D. MILLER This, this really is it, having a dialogue, making sure than you leave your feeling like "I got what I came here for." And if something occurs to you after our conversation today and you're think you know, "I would-- I really want Scott to know this," you could either text me that. If you're not comfortable with that, you could give me a call, okay? Would you prefer that I call you to check in midweek or what do you thinking? 

00:25:55
BOB BERTOLINO That'd be fine. 

00:25:55
SCOTT D. MILLER It would be okay? 

00:25:55
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:25:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. Good enough. And so, then let's just look at our books and see when we can get back together again. 

00:26:00
BOB BERTOLINO Okay. 

00:26:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. Let's stop here. 

00:26:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:26:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah, thanks. Uhm, I would like to say that this doesn't happen very often that I don't get feedback just like this, but I will tell you and I know Bob who also uses the measures regularly. He has his clinic doing this has developed his own system, ah, that uses the measures as well. That the longer you do it, the more feedback you end up getting from more of your clients. So, it does take some time. Initially, when you use the forms, you're much more likely to get very high scores on the SRS for example. However, I hope that you saw and, Bob, if you'll free again to jump in here, the things I was doing to try solicit at negative feedback. And these aren't things that come to me naturally, that what we've learned really from the study of top performing clinicians who were the first to point out that they solicited much more negative feedback than the average performers. So I say things like this. Uhm, I'm not interested in perfect scores. A 10 out of 10 doesn't mean very much to me. Life is not perfect neither am I. I'm truly interested in developing professionally, and each person I meet with gives me of that chance one more time. And what else did I say? Ah, there were probably a couple of others that were-- that, ah, that I, that I said in, in response. Ah... 

00:27:40
 Small features. 

00:27:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, this is another big one, thank you, that have-- that has come up again from top performers. They'll say, you know, it could be something big but most are-- and if it is, I'd like to know. Ah, most time it's not. It's a small thing that you might think isn't worth mentioning. Please mention it so that we can discuss it together and decide that together. Now, Bob gave on the form a-- let's just total this up here, and look at the graph. Uhm, Bob gave a score of 31.2. And if you look at the computer screen, it says 90% of those who complete this scale score higher. I'm hoping that that sort of does the same thing as taking you by the shoulders as a clinician and giving you a good shake. It's basically saying this really as important to pay attention to. The cutoff on the SRS is actually 35 to 36. Scores below 36 are considered poor. When he marks the form-- and I think this take some practice especially if you feel like you've been present heart and soul with your client and then they basically say you suck. That a practice presence of calmness and not panic and not defensiveness needs to be there. If you cannot do this without being defensive then don't do the measures. Ah, it-- the point here is to get clients to tell us what we did it took a part to individual items and large measures because Bob started talking, and identified what it was that seem not be going well in the process. He mentioned, ah, the approach and method that we somehow got off track. I simply tried to understand that. Bob, do you have anything to, ah, add or ex-- your experience of this? 

00:29:40
BOB BERTOLINO Well, it's just that I was purposeful and moving the, ah, slide all around on the last, uhm, domain because that happens a lot. Clients will look and then they'll change it. They are making adjustments. Sometimes they can't even say why and so, uhm, Scott asking me questions about that. That, that degree of attention I think really makes a difference that lets the client know you're really listening and paying attention and noticing. And sometimes they can explain exactly why which was my ambiguous response but that's what happens. And, uhm, there's also a sense from some clients. They feel like, "Oh, if I mark it a little lower I'm hurting your feelings," or "I don't want you to feel bad about yourself" and they'll go onto a protective mode even though they have one foot out the door. So, uhm, that was-- I wasn't-- you won't find, uhm-- you-- you'll find-- quite a few clients that are secondly guessing themselves as they're doing it. So... 

00:30:35
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. All right. I think all of these things you said, Bob, are really critical. And the, the one that I, I want to underscore is that when you first start this, you may get very little feedback, you'll get perfect scores on the SRS. And I'm telling you and Bob is telling you don't take that shit seriously, ah, ah, because a 40 may simply be, "Can I go now, please?", ah, when they fill it out. The second thing we say and I said in the workshop on Wednesday was you get three chances to deconstruct the client's feedback. You're at the end of your visit. They know it's-- the, the time is up, you're waiting, you're other person that you're gonna see next is waiting. Three questions is what you get. After three questions, if you haven't gotten any specific feedback then you need to give up because you're just becoming annoying after that. One last piece I hope you saw is that when Bob gave feedback and I was trying to understand it, then he said-- he hinted-- and this was spontaneous, we hadn't planned this-- but he hinted that you know, I'm-- I wa-- I' m not sure if I, if I would have come back. I'm sure I would set another appointment. Two things to notice. The scores weren't that low seemingly, but still a doubt was in his mind about whether or not he is coming back. The, ah, the second thing to notice is that when that happens and my god stands up, ah, straight and says, "Wait a second. Pay attention to this," this is when I'll say, "If you'd like to, you can call me or text me with any further observations. One thing we've learned from top performing clinicians as we well, they tend to have more unplanned therapist-initiated contact between visits than average therapists. Now this doesn't mean we should all in, in a, ah, sort of evidence-based fashion start calling our clients between visits. What it means is that when your gut tells you they may not be coming back, don't wait for that to happen. Pick up the phone, give them a call and sau, "How are you doing?" Uhm, when that happens in healthcare, I think people are mostly shocked that the physician, the dentist, ah, the periodontist, whoever it is to call you and says, "How was it? Are you doing okay?" Uhm, what I'm trying to do with this point is secure on-going engagement with the client. Does this make sense? Okay. Bob and I thought we do one more brief, ah, example of the scale, ah, with somebody with a question that comes up quite often. Ah, and that question is, what happens if clients aren't on us on the scale? Let say a client comes in and they are mandated into care. Ah, what do you do then? So, let me just start this process over again. 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:40
SCOTT D. MILLER And we're going to assume that the introductions for the ORS have been done and I'm giving Bob who has been sent here by the courts, ah, for whatever reason. Ah, I'm giving Bob a, ah, the-- giving Bob the ORS. So, Bob, would you be willing to fill this out in? 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. So, let's, uhm, take a look here what happens. Uhm, we get yellow this time, Bob. And, essentially, what it says is the client s--scored more like people who are not in treatment and reporting that they are functioning relatively well. 

00:34:30
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:34:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Is that true? 

00:34:35
BOB BERTOLINO True. 

00:34:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Wow! And so, what else e-- the other things it says is that we need to be quite careful because when a person who'd doing quite well sees a person like me, there is a large chance that we could make people worse. 

00:34:55
BOB BERTOLINO That's awesome. 

00:34:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. So I don't want that to happen. And I'm guessing that, ah, if things are going so well and I don't want to make you worse, can I, can I ask you what, what brought you in? Why, why might you come to see a person like me? 

00:35:15
BOB BERTOLINO My PO told me grow up so I, so I gotta be here otherwise they're, they're not gonna let me drive again. They're gonna, ah-- they said they might just you know, put me back in prison. 

00:35:25
SCOTT D. MILLER What? 

00:35:25
BOB BERTOLINO So... 

00:35:30
SCOTT D. MILLER So, you can see a guy like me and I can make you mentally ill or you can go back to jail. 

00:35:35
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. That's right. I better be mentally ill. 

00:35:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:35:40
BOB BERTOLINO Ah, ah, I didn't have a choice, so... 

00:35:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. You're, you're following through. You're doing what they told you because you don't wanna end up violated back in, back in jail. 

00:35:50
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:35:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, you wanna be able to drive, get out of the house, etcetera. 

00:35:50
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. I'm excitedly to tell them I'm good. 

00:35:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Well, the score certainly say that things are going relatively well. I guess the question is how to convince them of that. Would you agree? 

00:36:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:05
SCOTT D. MILLER So - 

00:36:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:36:05
BOB BERTOLINO - let me, let me-- I, I rarely do this, but I'm, I'm wondering if I could ask you to fill this out, ah, one more time but fill it out from the perspective of your PO. Would you be willing to do that? 

00:36:25
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, all right. 

00:36:25
SCOTT D. MILLER So, here we go. Now-- and before you fill it out, I want you to think back now from your perspective because we know you are, you, you are doing well. Interpersonally, individually, socially, things are on track. It's just that they don't think so. 

00:36:45
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:36:45
SCOTT D. MILLER And for as long as they don't see you as good, as doing as well as you think you are then you have to come to a place like this. And I imagine you can think of a bunch of other things you'd rather do. 

00:36:55
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:36:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. So, think like that probation officer he or she. 

00:37:00
BOB BERTOLINO She. 

00:37:00
SCOTT D. MILLER She. Would you fill it out as if you were her. 

00:37:10
[sil.] 

00:37:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. All right. Thanks. So, she sees things quite different in quite you do at the present time. 

00:37:30
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:37:30
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. And if we look at those individual marks, one thing you are in closer agreement about is your interpersonal relationships. Can you say - 

00:37:40
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:37:40
SCOTT D. MILLER - something about that? 

00:37:40
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. That's - 

00:37:45
SCOTT D. MILLER It could be less, less room there. 

00:37:45
BOB BERTOLINO - that's not, that's not work out me there. 

00:37:45
SCOTT D. MILLER It's not work out you there. 

00:37:50
BOB BERTOLINO Uh-hmm. 

00:37:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Would she say you're stronger in that area then? 

00:37:50
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:55
SCOTT D. MILLER If she say, as a result of what? 

00:37:55
BOB BERTOLINO Ah, well, she just say it's not a big deal. She just say you know, just, you know, be good. 

00:38:05
SCOTT D. MILLER All right. 

00:38:05
BOB BERTOLINO And-- but she would really say anything. We haven't really talk about my relationship 

00:38:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Now, okay, are you in a relationship? 

00:38:10
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:38:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. Uhm, married? Single? 

00:38:15
BOB BERTOLINO Girlfriend. 

00:38:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Girlfriend. 

00:38:15
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:38:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right. Some areas where she thinks things are little bit different, ah, or more different rather are individually and socially. 

00:38:25
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:38:25
SCOTT D. MILLER So, let me ask, what would she have to notice different about you - 

00:38:30
BOB BERTOLINO She... 

00:38:30
SCOTT D. MILLER - that would tell her things are actually the way you use they say they are socially or individually. 

00:38:40
BOB BERTOLINO Well, she doesn't believe me when I say I'm not drinking. 

00:38:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:38:40
BOB BERTOLINO So she thinks I need to not drink cuz I had three DUIs. 

00:38:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. All right. 

00:38:50
BOB BERTOLINO So, she's-- that would she thinks, but... 

00:38:50
SCOTT D. MILLER And that-- which, which one does that go on? Does that go on both in here? 

00:38:55
BOB BERTOLINO It's up here - 

00:38:55
SCOTT D. MILLER That's the individual. 

00:38:55
BOB BERTOLINO - where she like just thinks that I have a problem. I don't really think - 

00:39:00
SCOTT D. MILLER Okay. 

00:39:00
BOB BERTOLINO - I have a problem. 

00:39:00
SCOTT D. MILLER And you're saying that's handled. You've got that down. 

00:39:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:39:05
SCOTT D. MILLER But she's feeling quite different about that. 

00:39:05
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah, she's on when the... 

00:39:05
SCOTT D. MILLER And the key here you said is she has to somehow find out how good things really are. 

00:39:10
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. 

00:39:10
SCOTT D. MILLER How she gonna find this out? What would she notice about you that would make her feel more confident about that? 

00:39:20
BOB BERTOLINO Well, I think she... 

00:39:20
SCOTT D. MILLER We can stop. We can stop here. 

00:39:25
BOB BERTOLINO Let's get an end to it. 

00:39:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. So, for, for Bob and I, for the members of the ICCE, for people who are doing feedback informed work, honesty is not a word that you're going to hear used about the measure. It's about taking the perspective of the client and the others around them. And Bob here says things are great, that he's obviously not here for a treatment of himself. He's here for POD, Probation Officer Disorder. And so, that's the problem we're treating. What is it that she wants, and most importantly, what is it that she needs to see so that she'll feel confident as you do about how well you're doing, etcetera. In this interview, we'll just continue to unfold, uhm, depending on your particular style or way of working. This is how we would integrate the measure with the client who is, uhm, who is mandated into care. 

00:40:25
BOB BERTOLINO Or with, like my agency, we do, we work with that adolescents, and adolescents, it's not there. They're not the ones who initiate services. So, it-- uhm, a lot of times they're, they're scoring very high. They're parents are caregivers. Someone else is saying there's a problem. So, the same kind of approach. 

00:40:50
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. So, this is one of the basic skills of, ah, feedback informed work which is introducing the measures and integrating the measures into the contact. Again, I'm hoping you won't treat this like bookends but rather integrate them throughout the conversation you might have like you saw in the interaction here with Bob when he's role playing a mandated client. We have about, ah, 18 minutes or so left, if you have a question or a comment, we're glad to hear them. Please come up to the microphones, uhm, and Bob and I can, ah, answer. Maybe we start here to the right if that's okay. Yes? 

00:41:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Right. Thanks. Yeah. Ah, excellence stuff. I really appreciate it. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about how you balance the time so when you know, you have 45 minutes or a 50-minute session and lot of manage care situations? So, how do you balance the time you know, taken that time at front and then still have a time to do to work that you wanna do in the session with the client? Thanks. 

00:41:50
BOB BERTOLINO Uhm, my responses, it's, uhm, it's seamless really of what my experiences been as a clinician. Uhm, once they understand the process, it becomes a part of their everyday practice and really the amount of time is so small. It takes, you see, less than a min-- minute to do the measure. Uhm, if you handscored, it takes a little longer on paper. If you're using electronic system, the results are instantaneous. But it becomes just part of the everyday process that's, uhm-- that you use and it-- yeah. 

00:42:25
SCOTT D. MILLER I think it's the same as, ah, setting an appointment. It just become as you say a routine part of the process. This does take some practice - 

00:42:30
BOB BERTOLINO Yes. 

00:42:30
SCOTT D. MILLER - to make that happen. And he-- what's the worst that can happen? You get to the end of the session, 50 minutes and the client gives you feedback. If you're getting relatively low scores, you will be saving yourself time and, ah, and other problems by taking that 10 minutes in between visits and talking it over with your client. 

00:42:50
BOB BERTOLINO I would say to make sure there is time, uhm, Scott did well with this. Eh, they'll make sure that they don't just give two minutes. Because if there's feedback that you need to respond to, you need to make sure there's enough time to be able to get you know, helpful feedback. 

00:43:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Perfect. 

00:43:05
 Yes. I'm interested in how this might be applied to a group program so the participants, the clients are all in groups through, ah-- this is a two-week group program. Have-- is there an adaptation or use that could be applied? Thank you. 

00:43:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Uhm, there are-- first of all, a lot of people doing groups and discussing how to do this on the ICCE website. So, if you're not a member of ICCE, please join. It's absolutely free. There are no ads. Ah, they are simply people like yourselves that are struggling to integrate the forms into their work. In addition, manual number five, ah, manual number five in the FIT series that Bob edited has a whole section about how to do this in groups. Third, there is a special measure that GSRS or the Group Session Rating Scale that we published its first validation study in January of this year so that there's a special scale for the, for the-- for groups at the end. You use the same ORS at the beginning of your group. You've added another wrinkle or complication and that is when you have people in house for an intensive service process. In that case, you wanna treat it. You wanna-- you don't wanna do it every time you do a service otherwise it's gonna drive the clients crazy. Instead, think of the unit of service like a week. So, you might do the ORS at the beginning of one week and then the SRS at the end of the week. Those are some, those are some potential ideas. 

00:44:35
 All right. First of all, I thank you for your work. I've been using that ORS and SRS for a little over a year and it has completely revolutionize the way, the way that I do counseling. 

00:44:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Wow. 

00:44:45
 I cannot imagine turn to a counseling session without it, so I, I thank you for that very much. Uhm, I, I guess it is a really quick question regarding the SMA treatment response. Do you find that that's dependent upon maybe a particular diagnosis or like a community mental health consumer versus a, a product-pay affluent client. Do you find differences in their treatment responses? 

00:45:10
SCOTT D. MILLER It, ah-- I don't know about private pay versus not private pay but the system has been used to large-- in the largest numbers are from public health centers. Ah, there's no correlation between client diagnosis and, uhm, treat-- expected treatment response. There's hardly any correlation between diagnosis and treatment outcome. Ah, so diagnosis we don't, we don't see any, any, any correlation really. What we're looking at is the clients' likelihood of improvement over time. Uhm, how do they experience that. And it just gives us an opportunity as we've said that if, if it's not res-- if the client is not responding as expected, we can have a conversation about it. 

00:45:55
 Hi. 

00:45:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Hi. 

00:45:55
 This on? Okay. Uhm, right now, I do more psychological assessment than therapy and although I think many people see assessment as a terminal service or you just-- or referring on to people. Uhm, I'm just wondering if there are tools that your senders have developed or that you know of that perhaps assess client satisfaction with, uhm, debriefing or follow-up or assessing outcomes in that matter? 

00:46:20
BOB BERTOLINO Debri-- I'm sure I understand... 

00:46:25
SCOTT D. MILLER I, I can say this that, uhm, you can use the ORS - 

00:46:30
 Okay. 

00:46:30
SCOTT D. MILLER - to triage. So the lower the score, the more you want that client to-- in the front of the cue getting services quickly. Ah, not only because they are much more distress but also because they're likely to respond to the services. Secondly, I love that somebody who does assessment wants to find out how did the client experience their, their, ah, their-- the work they did. So why not give the SRS at the end of an, an assessment. Because, really, the value of your assessment is increased if the client and follows the crew with the recommendations. 

00:47:05
 Great. 

00:47:05
SCOTT D. MILLER And that's gonna often be dependent not so much in the accuracy of your diagnose or assessment, but how they felt about you in the process. 

00:47:10
 Okay. 

00:47:10
SCOTT D. MILLER So lovely. 

00:47:15
BOB BERTOLINO In our web-based system in my agency, we have individual, ah, family, ah, group therapy, we have school-based services, residential programs, transitional living and so on, and all of the youth and young adults, uhm, are put into, uhm, a wait-- on the wait list and it gives, uhm, you can see the scores and we can kind of, Scott was saying get an idea of the degree of crisis or severity of, uhm, their distress. And then, we can oftentimes move them into a program that might be a better fit at that point, so it does help us to-- in the terms of our response and the non-profits and agencies with those big wait list. This is a, this is a big issue. So... 

00:47:55
 Yes. I am-- I'm beginning a, a sex therapy research study in January and I'm using both the ORS and the SRS. And my questions are I had thought there was an, an article about using about using them where it actually you use both at the beginning of the session to ask how they were thinking about it since they saw you last week. 

00:48:20
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:48:20
 And I think it wasn't true if that's correct. So, I'm asking about how the use of it. In other words, uhm, ah, it's a 15-week program then we'll be taking them through. Should I do it every week? I actually have a plan to do every week for, for six weeks and then every other for the last half. And then, do you have a manual for those doing it manually? 

00:48:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Let's take the last question. First, there is a series of manuals that Bob, that Bod edited and many people in the room contributed to. I'm very proud of these manuals because they were written by team of practitioners who've actually implemented these things a-- around the globe. Cindy May(ph) is here in the audience she, ah, contributed, ah, a huge amount to their construction, etcetera. You can get those on my website at scottdmiller.com. There are six of them. They go for various aspects. There are simple reads. Ah, they are not technically complicated or siding tons of researches really kind of how to-- I don't know of any-- I-- I'm sure there's somebody who's done the SRS at the beginning and ask about the prior time, but I'm not aware of that. Uhm, the question you're asked about frequency of use. Ah, here's a, here's a, here's a key. We often have programs and I'm, not trying to knock it. But if the feedback cannot change what you're doing, then why ask for feedback? So, if your feedback is set or if your program is set and people are going to go inex-- and I know you may not say that, but if you're going inexorably through this regardless of their progress or feelings about it, then don't use the measures. Ah, it will just be inferiorating, ah, to people. Secondly, the frequency has to be determined individually. If your client has a low score and the expected treatment response is steep but your client's not changing, then you should continue to use the measure on an on-going weekly basis at a minimum. If, however, your client has reached the expected treatment response, after that you can begin to space out the cut-- the, the, the administration. So, it has to be based on the individual's response to the services offered as opposed to some set time limits when we assess. 

00:50:25
 Great. Thank you. 

00:50:25
 All right. My question was answered by the gentleman's question here, so the other part of the question was, have you found this new clinical practice to be a value when you have a clinical rapture in a session in augmenting that and repairing it? Second part of the question is, on both ends of the spectrum where you have people that are passive say and they're people pleasing and so they're giving you high scores or the other part of the spectrum where they're very kind of passive aggressive, and not telling you what you're doing wrong? Do you find that it's a good avenue for conversation within the therapy especially if there's been a rupture in therapy? 

00:51:10
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah-- I don't know how to say this but I'll just say it directly. I don't know any passive, aggressive people. I'm serious. I do know therapists who talked about passive aggressive people. And I don't say this to be funny, I say that we're shifting the burden to the client when we say they are passive aggressive with us and that's why they didn't get feedback. It's not their job to give us the feedback. It's our job to get it. Now, I don't wanna sound like I'm being mean or tough. What I, what I would say is, it's not because they are dishonest or passive aggressive or passive. You didn't get the feedback, figure out how you're going to get it. And so, what you'll need to do in order to do that is sit down and plan for this and deliberately practice how you're going to get the, the-- how you're going to get feedback from people. All kinds of people. And when you don't get it, if you're getting all high scores, that's the thing to notice - 

00:52:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:52:05
SCOTT D. MILLER - and sit down and think about what it's gonna take for me to get it from that person. 

00:52:10
BOB BERTOLINO Yeah. Practice, practice. 

00:52:10
 So so hoping-- I'm hoping that what you find also is that when the client is using this in yours in conversation that's able to come up about all of these high scores that they're taking more responsibility for their own health and their own healing. 

00:52:25
 This sounds as a therapist's agenda to me. 

00:52:25
 Okay. Thank you. 

00:52:30
 Yeah. 

00:52:30
 Scott, you're the second person in this conference to mention texting with clients - 

00:52:35
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:52:35
 - and yet, ah, if-- ah, ethics law and ethics presentation I've gone have said stay away from it especially in training agencies cuz - 

00:52:45
 Yeah. 

00:52:45
 - it might be a junior person who's getting a personal text on their own - 

00:52:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:52:50
 - space, so I wondered how you do that. 

00:52:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Ah, ah, you know, you'll-- you have to decide if you can tol-- the degree you can tolerate the risk, uhm, I, I think, uhm, I-- I'm interested in engaging clients. And right now, we're in ethical border line grey area about all this, uhm, and I, I think it will-- they'll probably need to be some cast cases etcetera. I, I find it appalling that we can't call, that we can't text, that, that, ah, that we see ourselves as only delivering services in our room face-to-face. I-- it's one of the reasons why are field is slowly dying, that we can't reach out and engage people, you know. 

00:53:40
 Thank you. Thank you. 

00:53:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. Will you please all come to my ethics defense? Ah... 

00:53:55
 Okay, so this is just a comment of gratitude and I've been using the system out of, ah, counseling agency that I've volunteered for. And I've just-- I've me-- it's a humbling experience as - 

00:54:05
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:54:05
 - a young mental health provider and I intend to use this throughout my whole professional career. So, thank you very much. 

00:54:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Oh, you're welcome. Let me, let me say one other thing about that. We have some brand-new research that was done. I mentioned on Wednesday by Daryl Chow. Uhm, and, ah, this humbling comments is really-- it really strikes in my heart. In fact, my hairs at the back of my neck are raising. Daryl found that one thing that separated the best therapists from the rest-- listen to this-- was that they were more frequently surprised b y client's feedback. If you let that sink in for a minute, I hope you-- it-- I hope you interpret it the same way. When you've heard it all, you've heard nothing about that client. So, when people are surprised as like, "Oh, my god! This is new. I can act differently. I can go on a different direction." So maintain that sense of "wow". A new person in my office, that's a big challenge in our work. Once you've heard it all, you're listening to nothing anymore. So, I think it's beautiful, what you said. 

00:55:15
 I'd, I'd like to just make a quick comment. Uhm, I'm glad you formalized the process. I was sitting in my office one day and I said there are three questions I'm not asking and that is do you feel listened to, do you feel respected, and do you think I'm the right therapist with the methods that I'm using? And the client said, "Why? Are you afraid you're gonna lose your job?" 

00:55:40
SCOTT D. MILLER Hmm. 

00:55:40
 And, and you know, to tell you the truth, I wanted to know. 

00:55:45
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:55:45
 And, and, ah, i-- it's struck him so odd that I would ask those questions. And I thought, we as profession, need more feedback not less. 

00:55:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:55:55
 So, I just wanted to make that brief comment. 

00:56:00
BOB BERTOLINO Right. Yeah. 

00:56:00
BOB BERTOLINO What I've noticed about our therapists-- ah, there's about 50 therapists at our agency and we've been using the measures for about 10 years. And, uhm, they are-- the one thing that would break their hearts is if they do-- that they weren't helping their clients. 

00:56:15
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:56:15
BOB BERTOLINO That's the one thing. And so, they incessantly talked about this and are puzzling over it and talking with each other. And it's gratifying to watch because you can learn so much just watching them, listening to their conversations. But they care. That's really what matter. I think it's a big step in that direction of engagement, uhm, for the purposes of something bigger. 

00:56:40
SCOTT D. MILLER And make sure that you integrate that comment into your introduction of the SRS. You know, when you give it simply say "It's really has nothing to do with my, my keeping my job or getting fired from my job. 

00:56:50
BOB BERTOLINO Uh-hmm. 

00:56:50
SCOTT D. MILLER It really has all to do with me finding out I'm not giving you what you want. And I'm truly interested. 

00:56:55
BOB BERTOLINO Uh-hmm. 

00:56:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:57:00
 In residential settings, particularly with adolescents, I'm wondering is there, uhm-- are you extending the SRS specifically to the parents of the adolescents as well evaluating cure performance with them as well as with the adolescent? And then, secondly, have you guys ever, uhm, extended the SRS to staff in residential-- the academic department and residential into those other-- because you know, treatment isn't isolated just in therapy. It's an experience as a whole. 

00:57:25
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. 

00:57:25
 So, I'm wondering if you could address both of those if you let them. 

00:57:30
BOB BERTOLINO So, those are all great ideas. What we do is we use the SRS. I'm specifically with the case manager of the therapists, uhm, but, ah, we-- and we don't send it out to the parents because we kind of feel like that's more client satisfaction. It's after the fact. That's not really in the moment feedback. But when every week, you can get them engaged. We are asking them questions, maybe not on the form but we are asking them about their perceptions and what we can do differently. We have used the SRS, uhm, in residential settings to get our polls of what the kids feel like is happening, uhm, in terms of their experience, ah, on a particular day. But, uhm, it's not use, uhm, in relationship to, ah, like in ORS. They just-- they're comfortable with the form and so they'll ask the kids, "Hey, can you fill one of this out about how you, you like you're doing today and how you feel like, uhm, things are going with staff. And they'll do it on like any given shift at any point in time. Uhm, and I know that's not how it was designed, but they appreciate a value of that feedback. So, uhm-- but much of it-- what we're gonna find I think down the road is the kind of stuff you're talking about is, "Let's see what can be done." 

00:58:40
SCOTT D. MILLER I think we have time for one more question. 

00:58:45
 I have, ah, kind of a cross between a question I'm misgiving about both instruments. For the, ah, SRS, it seems to me it would work best with non-relationship-focused therapists like, uhm, CBT. Because if you're analytic, for example, that with inter-- it seems to you that it produces a third person in the relationship, the forms, or if you're something like clients-centered, this is the stuff that should be coming out in the interview itself. So, it feels like it's kind of-- for, for relationship-focused therapists that it's shifting, ah, the relationship to, to something other than the therapists. And they'll say the other part and then shut up. The, uhm-- as to the other one, the, ah, outcome, it seems like what you're doing is persuading the client something about his experience other than what he's experiencing that you're saying things like. Well, you're not as-- ah, I'm, I'm hypothetical. I'm hyperbolizing. You're not as bad off as you think you are, look at this graph, or you're better off than you think you are, uhm, and then I'm done. Thank you. 

00:59:55
SCOTT D. MILLER Was there a question? 

00:59:55
 Uhm, well, I, I could have said it is true that, uhm-- I, I, I don't me to be, to be disputing. I'm, I'm just-- I'm troubled by both and I wanted your response. I'm not trying to argue. 

01:00:05
SCOTT D. MILLER No, no. That's fine. I'd say read more. Read more about the materials. I, I think these are important questions that you asked or comments that you make, uhm, ah, and, and download the article on the website. They're free. Uhm, and, and, and read bit more and see if it doesn't address some of those concerns which I think are, are important. 

01:00:25
 Thank you. 

01:00:30
SCOTT D. MILLER Yeah. Okay. Thank you all for coming. Thanks. 

01:00:35
BOB BERTOLINO Sure.
