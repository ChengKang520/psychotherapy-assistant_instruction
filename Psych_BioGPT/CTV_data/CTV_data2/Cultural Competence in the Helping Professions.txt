00:00:00
DERALD WING SUE Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Derald Wing Sue and welcome to the first in the lecture series of counseling the culturally diverse, theory and practice. This, ah, lecture series is being sponsored by both, uhm, Microtraining Associates and John Wiley and Sons, our publisher. The lecture series can be used as freestanding, ah, presentations on multicultural counseling and therapy or used in conjunction with the book that my brother and I wrote on counseling the culturally diverse. 

00:01:00
DERALD WING SUE Today's topic, really, is about cultural competence in the helping professions. There are a lot of questions and, hopefully, throughout this series and today that we will be asking and attempting to address. One of them is, what is multicultural counseling and therapy? Isn't good counseling, good counseling? How applicable are our standards of clinical practice for racial-ethnic minority groups or other populations like gay/lesbians, the disabled, and so forth? Is there any difference between counseling a white client and counseling, let's say, a Black client? What do we mean by multiculturalism and diversity? Do other special populations, for example, such as women, gay, lesbians, the elderly, and those with disabilities constitute a distinct cultural group? And lastly, what we will address today is what do we mean by the phrase, "cultural competence?" To answer these questions requires us to seriously consider changing our views about the world that we live in. 

00:02:20
DERALD WING SUE We live in a world in which we oftentimes function in what I call an "invisible veil" that prevents us from understanding how our worldview prevents us from seeing the world's, ah, view of other individuals. There are essentially one major concept that I call ethnocentric monoculturalism that prevents us oftentimes from seeing the worldviews of others. Now what is ethnic centro- uhm, ah, ethnocentric monoculturalism? It is the individual, institutional and societal expression of the superiority of one group's cultural heritage, their arts and crafts, their language, their, uhm, ah, religion, their traditions over another group and the power to impose these standards upon a less powerful group. As I mentioned before, there are these five components that we need to carefully consider as we enter into multicultural training. 

00:03:30
DERALD WING SUE First component of ethnocentric monoculturalism is belief in the superiority of one group's cultural heritage over another. Uhm, that group that is, ah, uhm, coming from that perspective, perceives their own group as superior, as favorable, as normative, in terms of its operation. Members of that society tend to perceive that their cultural group, ah, is superior and that they possess these feelings of superiority. 

00:04:00
DERALD WING SUE The second component of ethnocentric monoculturalism is a belief in the inferiority of all other groups' cultural heritage. Now, this is not necessarily conscious, but there is a belief that other societies, other groups, other racial-ethnic minority groups, for example, come from traditions, cultures that are inferior, less desirable, and we have oftentimes, terms that we use, for example, in the past, we would describe Native American, uhm, groups and cultures as primitive and less civilized, and this, ah, uhm, uhm, communicates the, ah, ethnocentric evaluation placed upon groups, uhm, ah, who are, uhm, uhm, racially, culturally different in our society. 

00:04:55
DERALD WING SUE Now the third component is the power to impose these standards on a less powerful group. The dominant group in this case has the ability to impose their standards of normality-abnormality, right, wrong, good and bad upon the less powerful group. Now power is the distinguishing feature of ethnocentric monoculturalism because all groups in many respects are ethnocentric, but it is the power to impose these beliefs and standards upon another group that creates difficulties and problems. Oftentimes, for example, to give you, uhm, ah, ah, ah, ah, a, a concrete example of what I'm talking about, oftentimes, our societies values the psycho-social unit of individual, of, of individualism. That is the unit of operation that our society works from. What we fail to realize, for example, is that three-quarters of the world, the psychosocial unit of operation is not the individual. It is the family, the group or the collective society. And as mental health professionals, we may be guilty in some sense of saying that individualism, autonomy, freedom, independence is highly desirable, and thus, the other groups that have a collectivistic orientation are seen as overly dependent, immature and so forth. And this indeed is communicated through our standards of practice in the mental health, uhm, ah, professions. 

00:06:40
DERALD WING SUE  The fourth component of ethnocentric monoculturalism is that it is embedded in the institutions and organizations of this society, in the programs of policies and practices that are truly invisible to us. They exist in chain of command systems, in evaluation systems, and training and educational systems, and they attain what I call "Godfather-like status," in terms of, uhm, how they determine, uhm, what is appropriate and inappropriate in terms of institutional behavior because most systems are monocultural in their operation. For example, many of you are going to a university, to a counseling psychology program, a clinical psychology program, a so, a social work program. What you need to ask is that, are the policies and practices of your training program monocultural? Because if they are, they are forcing compliance and may not accept differing viewpoints and, and, uhm, ah, situations. And what we have discovered that is very important in our work with institutions and organizations is that oftentimes, what happens is that you can be trained to become culturally competent in mental health practice, but it does very little good if the very institutions that hire you punish you by virtue of policies and practices when you exhibit that cultural competence. And so, as a helping professional, you need to begin to understand how organizations and institutions, uhm, ah, function. 

00:08:35
DERALD WING SUE The fifth component, of ethnocentric monoculturalism,is what I call the invisible veil. Ethnocentric monoculturalism is such a invisible aspect of our existence because it is culturally conditioned in all of us. These values and belief systems form our worldview. We never or seldom think about them. They are an invisible veil that dictates how we see the world. So that when we see different customs, cultures or behaviors evidencing unbeknownst to us, we evaluate them as being pathological, deviant or something undesirable. And it is that invisible veil that mental health providers must unmask unless, ah, or what we, ah, ah, ah, what happens in our mental health practice, is that we can become guilty of cultural oppression in our working with cultural di, ah, culturally diverse, uhm, ah, clients. 

00:09:45
DERALD WING SUE Now, how do we become, ah, culturally competent in terms of our work with various racial-ethnic groups, with women, with those, ah, individuals with disabilities, with gay/lesbians and so forth? And this strikes at the very core of the fact and in terms of all the research coming out that the traditional theories of counseling and psychotherapy are culture-bound. And because they are culture-bound, they may be inapplicable to other, uhm, ah, groups and populations that we hope to help. Now, what are, uhm, the components that we need to do in order to become culturally competent? The first one is having all of us become culturally aware of our own values, biases and assumptions about human behavior. What are the stereotypes, the perceptions and beliefs that we hold that, about culturally, ah, distinct groups in our society that may hinder our ability to form an effective helping relationship? It goes without saying that almost all of the social psychological literature indicates that none of us are immune from inheriting the racial biases if we talk about race of our ancestors and forbearers. For me to believe, for example, that I have been born and raised in the United States for some 64 years and somehow, or, I have become immune to, ah, inheriting the cultural conditioning of the biases of our society, I believe is the height of naivet√© or the height of arrogance in terms of the understanding. 

00:11:35
DERALD WING SUE So the first thing we need to do is, what is the worldview that we bring to the helping relationship? Let us become, ah, aware of them. The systems and the theories that we have been taught, whether it be Rogerian theory, Freudian theory, Cognitive Behavioral theory, uhm, ah, any number of these, uhm, ah, orientations and schools of thought come from a perspective of human nature. If we adopt them, we, in essence, are adopting a worldview that unknowingly, we may inappropriately impose upon culturally, ah, diverse clients that we work with and so without this awareness or understanding, again, I would say that we are in danger of imposing our values and our standards upon groups in our society that we are supposed to help, but indeed we may be oppressing in one way or another. 

00:12:40
DERALD WING SUE The second, ah, component of cultural competence is to have each of us acquire the knowledge and understanding of worldviews of culturally diverse groups and individuals in our society. What biases and values and assumptions about human behavior do these groups hold? The most, uhm, these questions I would ask of you probably drive home the second point. Do you believe that Asian-Americans have a different worldview? Do you believe that African-Americans have a different worldview? Do you believe that Native Americans, Latino-Hispanic Americans have worldview? Do White Euro-Americans hold a worldview? My answer, of course, is yes. I can also go further in terms of asking other socio-demographic, uhm, ah, variables as well. I oftentimes ask, ah, my wife oftentimes actually tells me this that men and women have different views of the world and I think that many of us would agree to that. 

00:13:50
DERALD WING SUE So the question is that if gender can determine worldviews, why not race, culture, and ethnicity? And again I would go to primarily the example I just made about, for example, that, uhm, ah, Asian-Americans believe that once identity is formed from the constellation of the family, the group or like the whole community. In the United States, we value rugged individualism. That is the worldview of western, uhm, thinking. Asian thinking is that one does not exist apart, uhm, ah, from the family and it comes out, it affects many ways that we behave. Let me give you one example. You know, when my father meets someone on the street, his question, when, well, let me go back, when most of us greet one another in class or when we're, ah, greeting each other in other environments, our first question, (coughs) excuse me, may be something like, "How are you today?" My father never greets individuals like that. His question is always, "How is your family today?" and I submit to you that those two questions represent a different view of the world, an individualistic perspective and a group or collectivistic, uhm, ah, perspective and the individualism, collectivistic, uhm, collectivism dimension, really is a powerful determinant of worldviews. 

00:15:35
DERALD WING SUE Worldviews also differ among racial ethnic minorities and those of our white brothers and sisters and it does this, ah, through social-political areas that we will discuss throughout this, uhm, ah, lecture series. For example, a worldview is not formed just solely through cultural upbringing and, uhm, uhm, you know, differences and values. How differences are perceived in a society or culture forms a worldview as well. As an Asian-American born and raised in a pre, primarily, I would say mono-cultural society, my experience of being different, of prejudice, of stereotyping also forms an intimate element of my, ah, worldview, so that it affects racial realities, so that the racial reality that I will say here and we will get into in detail in future, uhm, uhm, lectures, the racial reality of people of color is far different from the racial reality of White Americans and it is a class of, a clash of worldviews and racial realities that oftentimes result in what I call, uhm, ah, the major misunderstandings and difficulties we have in terms of, ah, understanding one another's worldview. 

00:17:05
DERALD WING SUE +The third major component of cultural competence is having each of us begin the process of developing appropriate and effective helping, ah, intervention strategies in working with culturally diverse groups and individuals. Now, I think that something, ah, will become very clear to you that the field of mental health oftentimes believes in universal applications of concepts or standards of normality and abnormality, but oftentimes universal that when you, good counseling is good counseling. It doesn't matter whether you're red, white, black, yellow, whether you're a man or woman, gay or straight, good counseling is good counseling. Almost all of the studies that are coming out in the field of multicultural counseling and psychotherapy indicate that different groups perceived helping differently. Ah, to give you an example, uhm, in traditional Western counseling, we're oftentimes very task-oriented. As a psychologist or a therapist, I am taught to get to the heart of the matter, identify the problem. Solve it. So when a client might come in, I might be very focused upon what is the problem and let's find ways to solve it. 

00:18:30
DERALD WING SUE Now, uhm, when, what we don't realize oftentimes, is that in many cultures, directness, getting to the point is perceived negatively. While it may be a, a value, ah, valuable approach, subtlety and indirectness, for example, is highly valued by many clients. In my early work with international students, when I, they would come to me in the counseling center, uhm, ah, with, with difficulties and issues, I would start the session by focusing in on what they define as the issue or the problem. They became very offended by that. Ah, it is very important that, ah, as my father has taught me that subtlety is considered very appropriate and, as a result, indirectness of how you talk about the problem is very important. So we're talking now about different techniques and strategies that are linked to culture that many of us need to become, ah, aware of. 

00:19:35
DERALD WING SUE The other thing about helping processes and strategies is something that, ah, we have become increasingly aware of. Most forms of counseling and psychotherapy is focused upon remediation, that is, clients with problems come to us and we help them with problems that they are encountering or that they, in some sense, ah, possess. Very little of our training is based upon prevention. Multicultural counseling and psychotherapy moves the focus to prevention as well as, uhm, ah, ah, remediation. If indeed prevention is important, then we have to begin to ask if problems are not located within the individual, but in the system. 

00:20:25
DERALD WING SUE  Let us now talk about issues of discrimination, prejudice, and stereotyping. If you are working with a, uhm, a client of color, whose problem is really part of the social system that oppresses them, uhm, ah, in one way or another, it seems to me that the helping professional should direct their attention to, ah, ending or meliorating the oppressive forces in the, uhm, ah, client's environment to prevent them from becoming victimized in one way or another. And this is something that we're realizing that, that the role of helping professionals in multicultural counseling and psychotherapy means that they have to exercise appropriate systems intervention in order to be effective in working with, uhm, ah, different client, uhm, ah, populations. 

00:21:25
DERALD WING SUE Another issue of, uhm, appropriate, ah, intervention strategies deals with a pet peeve that I've always had and that is that I think all of you, uhm, in your coursework, have talked about how can we adapt theories of counseling and psychotherapy to be more appropriate when we work with Asian clients, Black clients, when we work with, uhm, ah, gays, people with disabilities, the elderly and so forth and what we're trying to do is modify, uhm, the current Western European theories and apply them to our culturally-diverse population. I ask you this question, what did China, Africa, Latin America ever do if they never had counseling and psychotherapy? 

00:22:20
DERALD WING SUE Now, I, that question is a very important one because western cultures believe that, that counseling and psychotherapy never existed until they came along and invented it. Well, helping, indigenous helping has always been in cultures and societies. If you look at China and Japan, they have always, if they have survived all these thousands of years without counseling and psychotherapy, ask yourself, "How did they do it?" Well, maybe counseling and psychotherapy isn't needed, is not important. I truly don't believe that, but what I want you to entertain is that all groups, all societies have indigenous help-giving, non-western networks that may not look like anything like counseling and psychotherapy, but may have been equally effective. And so, what we do in western psychology with many of the racial ethnic minority communities, is that we go into a community like what we did in San Francisco. We went into Chinatown, destroyed the natural help-giving networks that were present in the community, set up our western offices and sat back and wonder why it was that the Chinese, ah, ah, citizens didn't come in, ah, for help and I guess what I find is that this is another example of, uhm, how good intentions went astray. 

00:24:00
DERALD WING SUE So I ask you that, "What can we learn from these non-western indigenous healing methods?" And it is important because I propose and submit to you that a, a form of helping would look far different if we went into, ah, communities and build up from these indigenous healing practices than if we took theories of counseling and psychotherapy from a western perspective and tried to modify them. So I believe that it is very important for us to begin to look at indigenous healing practices in Japan, in Hawaii, in Africa that, ah, may be more appropriate in application to the culturally diverse groups that we have here. The last, uhm, ah, ah, step to cultural competence that I feel very important for all of us to be, again, is to as I've said understand how organizational and institutional forces either enhance or negate, uhm, the development of multicultural competence and it does this in a very damaging way. Many of us don't realize that we, when we are employed by a mental health agency, that when I teach here at Teachers College, that there are policies, practices, and rules that determine what is appropriate or inappropriate for me to engage in. Supposing those rules and regulations do not allow me to manifest my cultural competence in, ah, ah, in my teaching with students or in my work with clients. And if that is the case, it is very important for mental health professionals to begin to think about intervening in organizational policies and practices that oppress you and other, ah, individuals who may be culturally, uhm, ah, different. 

00:26:10
DERALD WING SUE And this is not an easy thing. We have avoided this in terms of our education and training. Organizations have powerful hooks on us. You know, they can prevent us from being promoted. They can fire us. They can isolate us. For us to go against the norms and policies of an organization can bring great repercussions. And one of the things that you will surely learn, uhm, throughout your reading of the book, "Culturally, Counseling the Culturally Diverse," and in this lecture series is indeed the fact that I propose to you that we need to become individuals who will intervene in our systems as well and in terms of, uhm, organizations. My brother Dave and I have, uhm, for many years, worked upon a model of cultural competence that you can see in the PowerPoint that we will also be, ah, that will accompany this tape and, ah, will also be present in the, uhm, ah, in the tape itself, but we see, we've developed what we call a multive, ah, Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence. And this occurs at the individual level, at the profe, professional level, at the organizational level and at the societal level. You can see that these four areas are in concentric circles, each pointing a relationship with one another. It is very difficult to, uhm, ah, change, uhm, to individually become culturally competent without all three others of these, ah, areas of focus having, uhm, ah, change as well. 

00:28:05
DERALD WING SUE Let me talk about the individual level, which is primarily what your training is aimed at. That is that we want you to become culturally competent. We want you to have the skills, the knowledge, the expertise, the sensitivity to work with culturally, ah, ah, di, diverse clients. That is the focus here. And as a result, the major barriers oftentimes at the individual level is the prejudice and the biases that you inherit by virtue of being born and raised in the United States. You have been fed misinformation oftentimes, not for, you know, because of, of your, ah, choice or desire. None of us, I say, was born into this world wanting to be racist, sexist, homophobic and so forth. We took this on through a powerful process of cultural conditioning, through information or education that we, ah, oftentimes think is aimed at freeing us, indeed traps us and feeds misinformation, uhm, ah, to all of us and, ah, it occurs with our friends and organizations that instill in us certain biases. And even though, however, that we may freely admit that we have these biases and we nur, need to overcome them to become, ah, culturally competent, it is a very difficult process because the first step to do this on an individual basis is to become aware, to make the invisible visible. 

00:29:50
DERALD WING SUE The power of our cultural conditioning is that it's outside the level of our awareness. I don't know that I have biases. I experience myself as a good, moral, decent individual and all of you, I think, that are viewing it, really would never consciously oppress or hurt other individuals. Yet we have an, ah, a subtle conditioning that imbues in all of us certain biases that unless we open them up and look at them carefully, will dominate and dictate how we behave when we encounter, uhm, our clients of color. I mean, oftentimes, a client of color will ask a white counselor, for example, a question like, well, if they are, for example, involved in the inter, ah, interracial relationship, they will ask the white counselor, how, as a test of, uhm, ah, test of their trust in them, uhm, "How do you feel about interracial relationships?" If you're the white counselor and you, on a conscious level believe it's okay, but on an unconscious level you have hesitations or are out of touch with the biases, you might simply say, "Oh, I think it's okay." What is happening here is that your non-verbose are contradicting your verbal communication outside the level of awareness and the client of color will pick this up, that you either are uncomfortable or as many black, uhm, ah, brothers tell me that, isn't this typical of white folks? Say one thing but mean another. 

00:31:40
DERALD WING SUE This is something that all of us need to work with because, ah, it's become clearer and clearer in all of the studies that are going on, that clients of color tend to terminate counseling and psychotherapy at greater than a 50 percent rate after the first initial contact with the helping professional. And my brother and I have always asked why is that so? And I think that in talking through focus groups, to clients of color, they will indicate to us that Dr. Jones doesn't seem to really understand the Asian experience, the Black experience or I don't know what it is, but there's something about Dr. Jones that makes me uncomfortable. These factors really prevent a, a therapeutic alliance from occurring, unless you, the helping professional, begin to look at yourself as a racial cultural being that has inherited biases. 

00:32:45
DERALD WING SUE  I also want to say at this point that I've been talking about white people of color as relationships, something that, uhm, in the most recent edition of, "Counseling The Culturally Diverse," that we're beginning to look at, is that multicultural counseling and psychotherapy is more than White Black, White Asian, White Latino, White Native American. It is also Asian Black, Black Latino, uhm, ah, Latino Native American, Native American White, all of these different combinations and so, this represents, ah, ah, an area that none of us, no group is free from this exploration of themselves as a racial, ah, cultural being. 

00:33:35
DERALD WING SUE There is a second level in this multidimensional model of, uhm, ah, developing cultural competence that we call the Professional Level that prevents us oftentimes, uhm, ah, from becoming culturally competent. At the professional level, what I say is that the field of psychology, for example, the field of social work, the field of psychiatry, the field of the mental health professions are culture-bound. All you have to do is look at the definition of psychology. Now simplistically, we define psychology as a scientific study of the mind or behavior. Now, ah, that might be appropriate at some level, but, you know, if you look at history, psychology originated from African-Egyptian civilization. At that time, it was defined as the study of the soul and the spirit. The Greeks took it over and redefined it as the study of the mind and ultimately western psychology, the study of behavior. So what we again have is that even the definition of psychology that we look at today is culture-bound and in some sense doesn't tap into the, ah, the multiple dimensions of the human experience. We are not talking about just the mind or the cognitive aspects of behavior, ah, nor behavior, but we are talking about, uhm, aspects that deal with our feelings, with, uhm, ah, our, our, ah, ah, social and our, our political, our spiritual, ah, aspects and western science has tended to really ignore an important dimension of the, uhm, ah, human experience. 

00:35:35
DERALD WING SUE The other thing that really, uhm, is culture-bound from a professional level, ah, is that all of us as psychologists belong to, let's say, professional organizations. I belong to the American Psychological Association. The American Psychological Association has standards of practice and codes of ethics that determine the appropriateness of my professional and ethical behavior. Now, that is fine and good, but supposing those standards of practice and codes of ethics are also culture-bound? And in many of the studies that we're, uhm, ah, uhm, looking at, we find that, uhm, that there are codes of ethics, standards of behavior that are entirely culture-bound. For example, uhm, in most forms of counseling and psychotherapy, psychotherapy, we're taught not to give advice and suggestions to our clients because it would foster dependency. We say that we don't disclose our thoughts and feelings to clients in one way or another or unnecessarily influence them. We don't serve dual-role relationships. It is unethical because there is a conflict of interest that, uhm, may occur. We do not accept gifts from our clients because it unduly obligates us and we'll lose objectivity. 

00:37:05
DERALD WING SUE  Well, again, those are very rational western, uhm, ah, dictates that form the basis of codes of ethics and standards of practice, but supposing culture, different cultural groups consider those behaviors that we call therapeutic taboos to be precisely aspects of a helping relationship. African-Americans consider a helper, a healer who expresses and discloses their thoughts and feelings to be authentic and genuine. So that the objective approach of western counseling and psychotherapy is oftentimes by, ah, black clients or African-American clients perceived as the person having something to hide. Among Asian cultures, gift-giving is a culturally-sanctioned approach. If you, the helping professional, refused a gift, you are unwilling, ah, unwittingly refusing what they consider to be an intimate aspect of their cultural, ah, being. Uhm, these are things that our field seldom recognized and it calls, it calls for almost a complete paradigm shift in terms of how we deliver, uhm, helping to other, uhm, ah, individuals. 

00:38:30
DERALD WING SUE  The third level of cultural competence deals with change at the organizational level. Almost all organizations, mental health, uhm, ah, agencies, schools, ah, business and industry tend to operate from what I call mono-cultural, uhm, ah, policies, ah, mono-cultural, ah, practices, uhm, that in some sense may be inappropriate for, for many, let me give you a work-related, uhm, ah, issue here. Several years back, uhm, ah, I was asked to go into a, uhm, ah, major, ah, company, a Fortune 500 company, to help the company deal with what they considered to be unrest among the Asian-American employees in technical, ah, ah, workforce. Ah, one of the things that, uhm, they said was that, uhm, ah, you know, they took a survey and the Asian-American, uhm, employees that were, uhm, ah, working there, on the survey indicated that they did not feel that they were fairly treated by the company, that they were not promoted when otherwise qualified, that they felt that they would leave the company because their movement into middle, middle and upper management was seriously hindered, uhm, ah, in terms of, of the company policies and practices. Well, the group of White, uhm, ah, ah, vice presidents, directors asked me to come in and they indeed said to me that we value the work of our Asian technical workforce. Johnny Cheng(ph) is one of the most outstanding, uhm, ah, computer programmers we have and they followed up with the, the, uhm, the word, "but", when they, our Asian employees do not make good leaders. They don't speak up in our, ah, team meetings. They don't contribute to the dialogue and, ah, I don't think that we're being unfair, when indeed, uhm, ah, we don't promote them to be managers. They are good technical workers, but they make poor managers. 

00:40:55
DERALD WING SUE Now, this strikes at something that have always, ah, in our research, ah, study, that's a dominant stereotype of Asian-Americans, that we make poor leaders, that we are inarticulate, that we're good with science, math and numbers, but we don't relate to people well personally. Even though my wife oftentimes accuses me that it's true about me, I don't want you to, ah, (laughs) believe that, but in essence, what we're talking about is a dominant stereotype of Asian-Americans. Now, I began, uhm, to work with this team and asked them, "What are the criteria that you used to evaluate whether someone will be promoted to a supervisory or a management position?" Well, first of all, they countered by saying, "Well, ah, I know this is going to sound very bigoted and racist but maybe Asian Americans don't make good leaders and executives and, and top managers." And I would counter by saying, "Well then, how is it that Jap, ah, that Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong businesses and, ah, leaders are so successful?" And this baffled them for a while, but they came back by saying, "Well, maybe leadership is different in those Asian countries," and I said no. 

00:42:15
DERALD WING SUE  Among Asians and Asian-Americans, leadership is defined differently by how White Western society, ah, defines it. Leadership among Asians is the ability to work behind the scenes, to achieve consensus and to improve, ah, team productivity." It is not necessarily the person out front who is speaking up and, and so forth. It is the person who works behind the scene and I said that, "Why don't you do this? Ask co-workers of a team who do you believe is the individual that aided this team in terms of the highest productivity. And I bet you that many Asian and Asian-Americans names will rise to the surface," and indeed that is what happened. In fact, one of the things that we discovered was that, if you look at their performance appraisal system of, ah, which is a, uhm, ah, a policy in a system in an organization that determines who you, ah, recruit, who gets promoted and who gets hired and, and, and retained, that, uhm, one of the qualities of being a good manager that they actually listed was being aggressive, taking charge. It was all these western concepts of what constitutes a leader and when, when they were able to see that, they acknowledged the fact that this criteria within the company, while it treated every one the same and was applied equally regardless of Asian or White, it unfairly discriminated against, uhm, ah, Asian-American employees. 

00:44:05
DERALD WING SUE Now, uhm, the truth of the matter is that while they acknowledged this, several years later, I went back, the performance appraisal system was not touched and this gets to something that we will talk later about, uhm, ah, social-political issues that are going on. I realized that, uhm, why did they not touch the performance appraisal system? It was then that I realized that changing a performance appraisal system alters who will be promoted and who won't be. Those people who have always benefited from that policy will continue to benefit. If you alter it, they may no longer, uhm, ah, benefit. So that what I have subsequently learned is that performance appraisal systems in any organization or institution represents a most powerful force of, of, uhm, ah, trying to get change to occur. Companies and organizations are very willing to have, ah, their employees changed individually, on an individual basis, and so have, uhm, diversity training for their employees, but when I began to focus on organizational policies and practices, huge resistance begins to occur. So I want you to think about that when you are working for a school district, a mental health agency, uhm, ah, you know, ah, in government, uhm, ah, a business or industry, know that organizations are powerful forces that oftentimes are invisible in terms of how they control and dictate, uhm, your particular life. 

00:45:55
DERALD WING SUE The fourth level of competence and, and I, ah, ah, do admit that this is getting to a level, a very broad level here is the societal level. Uhm, you know, to me, uhm, one of the down, pitfalls of training culturally competent mental health professionals, is that we become too individually focused. And in essence, none of what, nothing of what we do or who we are, is apart from our society. Our society really holds powerful ability to define our reality. You can define power as economic might, ah, as military might. I define power as one group's ability to define the reality of everyone, uhm, ah, else. A good colleague and friend of mine, Dr. Robert Guthrie, who recently passed away, an African-American psychologist, wrote a very interesting, uhm, ah, book and well, you know, he wanted to indicate that the history of psychology was a White Western history and that the contributions of the, ah, psychologist of color was completely left out and not a part of the uhm, ah, of the history in terms of the textbooks that, ah, were going on. And what, uhm, the, you know, I really like the content, but I was more intrigued, and his book became a bestseller by virtue of the title. The title of the book as it relates to was, "Even the Rat was White." That was the title of Robert Guthrie's, uhm, ah, book and as many of you know, uhm, ah, we're oftentimes accused that, that psychology is based upon rat psychology. Robert Guthrie tends to say that even the rat used in psychological of, ah, experiments was white and as, he was symbolically saying that psychology and how we perceive everything is a White Western European, ah, perspective. And it is that reality that inundates the core curriculum of what we are being taught and that is what needs to be, ah, challenged because that is the power of determining racial reality. 

00:48:25
DERALD WING SUE  Let me give you several other examples that hopefully, will drive home this point so that you can begin to really think seriously about what you are being taught in traditional, uhm, ah, classes and, ah, what you read in textbooks years ago and I think in some school districts, it's still maybe true. I was taught that Columbus discovered America. Think about that. You know that's, we all know that, I mean, Columbus discovered America. What I found, uhm, ah, dis, disconcerting, however, was many Native Americans students would oftentimes say, be puzzled by that and say, "Well, we always knew where we were, we weren't lost. How can we be, di, be discovered?" And indeed what they indicate is that, it was Columbus who was lost. He thought he discovered the Continent of India and named the indigenous peoples Indians. And so, what I guess I'm saying is that, by virtue of saying Columbus discovered America, there is a hidden message. It elevates one group, white individuals and denigrates indigenous people. Now, people would say that's not the intent of it, but it is worldview that automatically does that. 

00:49:55
DERALD WING SUE Now, it becomes even more oppressive if I was to, ah, give you an example of a well-intentioned teacher teaching history about Columbus discover, discovering America. A teacher oftentimes will ask, ah, give a multiple choice exam, a true-false exam and in the true-false exam they may say something, ah, like Columbus discovered America. True or false? Now if you are a white student, that's easy, you'll mark true, Teacher, I got that right and, ah, the teacher will say, "Good work, Johnny or Mary. Yes, it is the right answer." Supposing you are a Native American and you know a different history? If you mark true, the teacher marks it wrong, that's the punishment, I mean, the, the part of the, the teacher, if you mark it true, the teacher will say, "Right." But in essence what you have done is sold out your integrity. If you mark it wrong, ah, false, the teacher, will say, "That's wrong, Johnny or Mary. Go back and study some more, uhm, ah, history." You are a caught in a double bind, a Catch 22 that becomes very oppressive and it is painful, truly painful, uhm, for people of color in this society to be fed a racial reality that they know is untrue. 

00:51:30
DERALD WING SUE Okay, likewise at the societal level of cultural competence I would also ask you, uhm, this particular, uhm, ah, question, "Who owns history?" Now, I also want you to think about that because the, the historical bias of U.S. culture and society, the answer to who owns history, is the answer to who holds the power in our, ah, society. So in essence I, I say, ah, the power to define reality and the fact that we go to school, fed a historical bias and buy into it forms a worldview that oftentimes, uhm, ah, proves to prevent us from becoming culturally competent. 

00:52:20
DERALD WING SUE Now there is another issue, an area, ah, that we need to be aware of. You know, oftentimes when I, ah, work with students in terms of, ah, counseling and psychotherapy, I will begin to talk about issues of, of race. I will talk about my, ah, Asian-American, ah, experience and what people will respond to me when they listen to it is that, "Derald, ah, why do you always have to talk about being Asian-Americans? After all we're all human beings. We're all unique. Uhm, ah, and you were either all human beings universal identity or in essence we're all unique." And I don't think that the individual saying that realizes that they have negated an important aspect of my group identity. In the past what I have found difficulty is, is communicating this to, uhm, ah, individuals. 

00:53:25
Levels of Identity: Individual, Group and Universal 

00:53:25
DERALD WING SUE So that, ah, some of the research that we began to look at indicates that we indeed have three levels of identity. The first level is at the Individual level of identity, the second level is the Group level of identity and the third level is the Universal level of identity. At the Individual level of identity, it is true that we are unique, that none of us, uhm, are completely similar to one another. Even though my brother Dave was born and raised in the United States, that he and I came from the same family upbringing, we're on the same genetic, ah, gene pool, uhm, similar experiences and, and so forth, we are also different, uhm, ah, from one another. We do not share completely identical, ah, uhm, gene pools. While even identical twins might have a similar genetic endowment, they have many non-shared experiences that make them quite different, ah, from one another. So that is indeed a fact. 

00:54:40
DERALD WING SUE There is a second level, uhm, well, let me go to the third level before we talk about the second level of group identity because the second level seems to cause us much difficulty. The third level of identity is the universal level of identity. It is similar to what, ah, the Shakespearean character, ah, Shylock once said, "That when I cut myself, do I not bleed?" saying that we are all human beings under the skin. And that is correct as well, that we all, ah, originated, ah, come from the same, ah, ah, species, Homo sapiens, we have common life experiences like, ah, birth, uhm, aging, death and so forth. We have biological and physical, ah, similarities. Anthropologists tell us that what is universal about the human condition that, ah, separates us from other, uhm, ah, ah, others in the animal kingdom is our ability to be self-aware. To, to be aware of ourselves in our context and that we have the ability to communicate at a highly sophisticated level with one another. So these things are aspects that are universal that oftentimes I hear makes us uniquely human and human beings that have commonalities. 

00:56:10
DERALD WING SUE It is the second level, the Group level of identity that causes most of us great difficulty in the society. This level is what I call, that touches on race, culture, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic class. All of these aspects of group identity or socio-demographic, ah, factors that influence, uhm, ah, our identity and they do form powerful means that, ah, of this that our society seems to have great difficulty touching. For example, uhm, I can give you one example, uhm, that years ago I had a student who wanted to come into our multicultural counseling program. He's a white student and he interviewed, we, we required them to interview with two faculty members and then go through a group interview. He came in, uhm, ah, and, ah, interviewed with me and, ah, I asked him during the interview, "Well did you talk to another faculty member, uhm, ah, on our, ah, in our department here?" He said, "Yes, I did." And I said, "Who was it?" Now unbeknownst to me, it was Dr. Elvin, ah, Jones, a good African-American colleague who was, ah, at that time, ah, Head of the Department of, of Educational Psychology. Ah, and the student, ah, kind of hesitated and said, "Geez, I can't remember his name." And I said that, "Well, uhm, you know, can you describe him?" And his description was that, "Well, he's a real good dresser," which he eliminated nearly all of the faculty in our, ah, department at that time, but in essence, uhm, ah, still there were a few individuals. I said, "Well, ah, you know, what did he look like?" And the white student hesitated and said that, "Well, he had short kinky hair." And I said, "Oh, you mean Professor Jones?" And he said yes. 

00:58:20
DERALD WING SUE Now I at that time wondered but I, I think I knew at some level it would have been so easy since we had 20 faculty members, there's only two faculty of color, Dr. Jones and I, for him to say that it was a black professor at the end of the hall and you begin to think why was it so difficult and it is so difficult because our society has made it difficult for us to honestly acknowledge, recognize and dialogue about race and racial, ah, issues and this again is something that we're going to be, ah, talking about. So that we need to as to a society look through these hang-ups about these group identities, uhm, that each of us have. 

00:59:10
DERALD WING SUE At the, uhm, at the group level of identity there is wider complexity as well for example, uhm, not all the, well, you know, I share multiple identities, all of us do. You know, I'm a man so with, with the, a socio-demographic with being a man that's one group of identity. I'm Asian-American and suppose I am gay as well, I have three identities that are operating, so when I go to a counselor and work with the counselor, for them not to recognize all three of those identities nor the one that is most salient can, ah, create difficulties in communications. The salience of identities also vary. For example if I'm with straight, ah, Asian friends it may be my gay identity that is very strong. If I'm with my gay friends, it may be my, ah, a different identity that, ah, ah, that is, is currently going on. So it really varies here so that when you do counseling and psychotherapy it is very important for you to integrate and touch the individual level, the group level and the universal level of identity. Avoiding any of those levels is to negate an intimate aspect of our identities in a holistic, uhm, ah, fashion. 

01:00:45
DERALD WING SUE Now given, ah, that preparation, what I would like to do is to define for you what we are going to talk about, ah, considerably, which is what is multicultural counseling and therapy and how do we define cultural competence? 

01:01:05
DERALD WING SUE Now multicultural counseling and therapy can be defined as both a helping role and process that uses modalities and defines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients, recognizes client identities to include individual group and universal dimensions. Advocates the use of universal and culture-specific strategies and roles in the healing process and balances the importance of individualism and collectivism in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of client and client systems. Now that's a very complex definition and let me try to break them up into units so that, uhm, in your discussions and readings you can begin to think about it very, uhm, strongly. The definition I have just given you contrast strongly with the traditional definition of counseling and psychotherapy from a western, ah, perspective. 

01:02:20
DERALD WING SUE First of all, ah, multicultural counseling and psychotherapy, uhm, involves helping roles and processes, that's one dimension. Now, uhm, I'm going to use shorthand language here, uhm, by calling multicultural counseling and therapy, MCT. Uhm, ah, MCT involves broadening the roles that counselors play and expands a repertoire of therapy skills considered to be helpful and appropriate in counseling. What I'm trying to, ah, indicate in this definition of multicultural counseling and therapy and everything that has gone, ah, ah, before that, is that counselors to be culturally competent need to play multiple roles that involved traditional helping roles but systems intervention and counseling roles as well so that teaching, consulting advocacy becomes a part of the roles and processes in multicultural counseling. 

01:03:30
DERALD WING SUE Second, what I emphasize is that MCT is consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of the culturally diverse groups that you will work with. Effective MCT means using modalities and defining goals for culturally diverse clients that are consistent with their racial, cultural, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation backgrounds. For example, I've given to you, giving advice and suggestions maybe completely appropriate as a, uhm, ah, as a strategy when working with certain groups. 

01:04:10
DERALD WING SUE The third component in this definition is that, it is for MCT operates and acknowledges the individual group and universal dimensions of existence. MCT acknowledges that we are unique, that we share things with certain groups and that we are all similar in many, ah, ah, respects and any, any approach that fails to recognize all three dimensions in some sense negates the important aspect of the holistic identity of clients that we work with. 

01:04:50
DERALD WING SUE The fourth component of MCT is the universal and culture-specific strategies. I'm not going to, uhm, ah, go into this, ah, in, in a, ah, great amount because we will talk about this in future lecture series. But there is, uhm, little doubt that almost all helping relationships whether we call it counseling, therapy or healing as, ah, my, ah, as, ah, Africans tend to call, ah, healing types of, of, of, of forces that there are commonalities that are present and shared in the healer and in the healing process. But there are also culture-specific areas and the task for culturally competent counseling is for us to balance both of them and acknowledge when one is, ah, effective and when to use both or, ah, one over the other. 

01:05:50
DERALD WING SUE The fifth one is a acknowledgement of MCT that it recognizes the importance of individualism and collectivism. Most west, western helping approaches as I've mentioned is individualistic in orientation and it doesn't mean that it is not applicable to Latino cultures, African-American cultures, Asian-American cultures. It recognizes, however, that that has to be moderated by our understanding of collectivism when we work with clients because clients are not simply individuals that are apart from, ah, the context from which they operate. I am part of the Sue family and I am part of the community and a part, what happens to me is really, ah, ah, intricately bound to the context of community that I come from. 

01:06:50
DERALD WING SUE The last one that I, ah, the sixth type of distinction of MCT is that the focus is on client and client systems and that's the key element, client systems. MCT assumes a dual helping role. It does acknowledge the legitimacy of one-to-one helping with individuals. I mean that is part of helping, of counseling, of therapy and of, of healing. However, oftentimes these systems from which our clients come from, the school district, uhm, the community, ah, that they come from may be the focus of their trouble so that healing must be directed at the system. The example I would like to quickly give you is that, an incident, ah, when I was, ah, consulting with a school district that had an African-American youngster, about 12 years old, who's constantly getting in fights on the playground. Uhm, he was one of the only black students on that primarily white school campus and he was constantly getting into fights. He was referred for counseling in the counselor's office who made, who asked the school's, school psychologist to make an assessment and they recommended that he had to stop his fighting behavior, he had to take, uhm, ah, medication and they diagnosed him as having a, ah, ah, burgeoning conduct disorder that they located as inability to deal with his impulsive anger and so forth. 

01:08:40
DERALD WING SUE  Now the focus of treatment was individual. Well when I came as a consultant I began to look at the broader scope and what we've realized was that, and I posed this through the counselor that, "What would you think if you knew that Johnny, the black student, was getting into fights because he was called names? He is being called a nigger. Ah, ah, he was teased mercilessly by, by all of the, his, his white classmates? Ah, would it alter your diagnosis in what you would do?" And it was clear to me that the intervention had to be the client's system, the school district, the campus climate, the teachers had to be educated, the students had to be, ah, educated. The focus in terms of working primarily with Johnny and it seemed inappropriate to me, "stopping fighting behavior." Well I can understand "stopping fighting behavior," but R.D. Laing, an existential psychiatrist I think, ah, made this statement that I want you to, ah, consider. He was making a statement of schizophrenia and he asked, "Is schizophrenia a reaction to a healthy environment or is schizophrenia a reaction to a sick environment?" 

01:10:15
DERALD WING SUE Now what am I saying by that? You know, while I can easily define Johnny's fighting behavior as being inappropriate, uhm, detrimental, uhm, pathological or sick, would it make any difference if it was a sick system that created the fighting? Is it possible and I'm not saying this is true, but is it possible for us to perceive that his fighting is an appropriate response in terms of the repertoire of responses that he has to a really hostile, invalidating, sick situation? And that's what I say is important for, uhm, all of us to begin to look at. 

01:11:00
DERALD WING SUE Now let me quickly go on over at this point as you read the textbook or think about this therefore, "What is cultural competence?" I've defined for us what multicultural counseling and therapy is and forgive me, let me read to you our definition again. Again it is quite complex, ah, has many implications here. 

01:11:20
DERALD WING SUE  Cultural competence is the ability to engage in actions or create conditions that maximize the optimal development of client and client systems. Multicultural counseling competence is defined as the counselor's acquisition of awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to function effectively in a pluralistic democratic society, the ability to communicate, interact, negotiate, and intervene on behalf of clients from diverse backgrounds. And on an organizational and societal level advocating effectively to develop new theories, practices, policies and organizational structures that are more responsive to all groups. This is what we call the, the aspect of equal opportunity, ah, for everyone. 

01:12:30
DERALD WING SUE In some sense the definition of cultural competence is, fits nicely into the goal of social justice. What is this definition? What are the characteristics of this definition? And I'll finish this, ah, quickly. First this definition of cultural competence in the helping professions, as I've mentioned before, makes it clear that conventional one-to-one in the office objective form of treatment aimed at remediation of existing, ah, problems may be at odds with the social, political and cultural reality and experiences of clients. Second, cultural competence can be seen as residing in three major domains, attitudes and beliefs, knowledge and indeed skills, the component. Your training needs to be aimed at those three levels to become culturally competent. Third, cultural competence, in a broad sense as I've mentioned before, is directed at both the individual and organizational institutions. I again emphasize that cultural competence must include, include macro levels of in, ah, intervention not just the micro level. Last, our definition of cultural competence speaks strongly to the development of alternative helping roles, change agents, consultants, teacher, uhm, ah, facilitator of indigenous healing practices are all roles that we seldom look at or occupy or get trained in. These roles tend to have certain qualities in them that conflict again with traditional forms of counseling and psychotherapy and I want you to think about it. 

01:14:35
DERALD WING SUE The roles of change agent, advocate, ah, teacher have a much more, one, have a much more active helping style. Two, work occurs equally well outside the office, in the home of clients, in institutions or the community. Three, being focused on changing environmental conditions as opposed to simply a change in the individual client. Four, we oftentimes need to view clients as encountering a problem rather than helping one, I mean rather than having one. And this is really an important basic, ah, a change in focus that has great meaning, that, ah, these roles tend to be oriented towards more prevention than remediation. And six, something that we as counselors may find great difficulty with, it means shouldering increased responsibility for determining the outcome of an intervention. 

01:15:45
DERALD WING SUE Now, ah, I, I, we've come to really the end of, ah, today's, ah, lecture on becoming culturally competent, but I really wanna leave you which is one parting, ah, ah, summary of what we all need to do. Again we all need to really become aware of our own worldview, who we are as racial cultural beings, what are the values, biases and assumptions about human behavior that we have and would it affect our roles as helpers. Secondly it's really quite important that we begin to reach out and understand the worldviews of our culturally diverse clients, not only from cultural difference but the social-political experiences of being marginalized groups in this society and so I, you know, I, I realize that it's impossible for any of us to understand all the worldviews of so many different groups in our, uhm, ah, society. But understanding one allows us to begin to understand other groups better and cautions us to, ah, ah, not to prematurely make evaluations that go wrong. Thirdly, it is very important for us to begin to break out the rigid confines of how we define the helping role and process. Effective multicultural counseling and therapy goes beyond the conventional counselor, ah, ah, clinical helping role. Lastly, all of us need to become much more involved with how organizations and institutions function, we have a responsibility to intervene at those levels and we have a responsibility to, in some sense be involved at the societal level with social policy. We need to begin to influence social policy so that we are on the journey to cultural competence and indeed social justice. Thank you very much for listening.
