"Group Discussion on Treatment and Intervention" - Guillermo Bernal, Ph.D., Nolan Zane, Ph.D., Beth Boyd, Ph.D., Jeannette Johnson, Ph.D., Steven Lopez, Ph.D., Linda Garro, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN So, uh, let's open up the conversation about, uh, what you've heard from yesterday's and from this morning's presentations on treatment of, uh, um, Asian Americans, Latinos, African Americans and American Indians. Uh, and the commentaries on, on, on the sessions. So, let's, let's hear from you. Joe. 

00:00:45
JOE I have a, a question for Steve and for Linda, and you know what I'm going to say about your approach, which is that I love the focus on processing, very, uh, interested and committed to thinking that way in therapy. Um, the concern I have about this, and it sounds like good therapy, and, of the, when the, there are certain notions of cultural confidence like Stan (inaudible ) talks about, dynamic sizing and scientific (inaudible ), which again, are often in the name of cultural competence, but that strike me as, uh, what would any good therapist be doing in terms of achieving inter-subjectivity as though they're (inaudible ). So, the question I have is, how do we keep culture from falling off the map with that kind of approach? And, um, what is it that's required in terms of background knowledge, skills, beliefs, and those sorts of things, that help one figure out and assess whether a local social world is, indeed, a social world, as opposed to an individual's psychotic experience or what have you? For example, if I tell you UFO aliens are chasing me, they'd have to be part of my (inaudible ), what, what I bring to therapy, but to make a judgement about whether that's, um, something you work with or not requires some sort of background knowledge. It seems obvious, in that case, I'll (inaudible ) worried about psychosis, but what if I told you that a witch was after me? There would have to be some kind of knowledge that we, you know, in the name of cultural competence, I would think, that would be required before you would even know how to work and interpret that as whether it's a reasonable aspect of a social world or not. So I just wonder, how is this, it seems to require some cultural knowledge in addition to just the skills of achieving inter-subjectivity, and I'm wondering what, then, happens to the cultural competence stuff, that was posited before, is providing that? 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Wonderful, thank you, uh, Joe. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Great comment. Not the first time we've heard it, not the first time we've heard it from you, uh, yeah, but, uh, you know. And it's, it hasn't been easy (inaudible ) our, our work. Uh, we get, 'oh, this is great, this is new stuff,' uh, and then, 'this is just, Western psychology.' Um, it it, or is the, or is the group-specific, uh, process. And so, we're, it, it's been a challenge. Uh, so, um, yeah, it is good clinical learning, no question about it. I think it's maybe an empirical question. My guess, my hunch, is that those who exhibit these skills with diverse clientele are going to do a better job than those who don't exhibit these skills and work with diverse clientele. And I also think that by understanding the, listening to narratives and how they define the problem, how they understand the, the theory, is culturally infused. I don't have a problem that psychosis is both part of a local social world in psych pathology. I don't think that they're disjointed. I don't think it's, they're isolated. I think they overlap. Um, so, I, I think that's, I would love to do a study like that to see if people who adhere to this, these behaviors, do a better job with culturally diverse folks. The other thing is that, no question about it, primary knowledge, background, we, uh, and there's no one that's really developing hypotheses, uh, but what I see, in listening to these therapy sessions, is there's very little shared negotiation. We only had about four that qualified, of all the statements, out of 41 sessions, that, appro-, approximated a shared negotiation. It's on the therapist, this is what it is. There's little about, uh, there's a lot, there's some accessing the client's point of view, and there's some about expressing the therapists point of view, but, it's, there's little, uh, you know, for example, somebody will ask the client what do they think, or, they, they'll say something and the client will respond, and the therapist will pick up where the therapist was before the client responded. So, they provided the space to listen to the client's point of view, but they don't integrate it in any way whatsoever. So, you raise, um, important points, uh, Joseph, but yes, this is good clinical care, but I think this good clinical care falls short in working, uh, people who have been clinicians fall short, in, in, uh, can fall short in these ways, before (inaudible ). I don't know if others want to comment on that. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN Okay. Other comments, or, uh, on this or on anything else, uh? 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. We talked a bit about what we would actually be doing when we're in sessions with clients. I'm wondering if any of you have opinions on what we need to be doing to better train our current batch of clinicians coming up through the ranks, or rehabbing our more seasoned clinicians. What kind of skills do we need to be emphasizing that they have, they acquire, what kind of self reflection, anything of that domain? 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN I don't have the answer, I just hold the mic. Um, actual, actually, uh, uh, Joe (inaudible ) and I were talking about, uh, de-centering experiences, and I, and I think, um, that, uh, there, there has to be, uh, mechanisms. And, you know, when you look at the, the way clinical psychology, psychologists, and I'm just going to speak to clinical psychologists, because, you know, the mental health profession has, like, I would say, most of the services not delivered by, uh, uh, uh, clinical psychologists (inaudible ) some ways we're, we should be speaking to, uh, clinical social worker programs, and, and, things like, and psychiatric nurses programs. But, (inaudible ) uh, uh, is we don't really have a lot of mechanisms to get students to, uh, shift their lenses, or de-center them. Um, um, there, there was a, a training model that was developed, uh, years ago, uh, by Paul Pedersen, called the Anti-Counselors Training Model, where, uh, the therapists, uh, role-played sort of a cultural alter-ego, and that, that's really one of the, you know, mechanisms by which we can, but I, uh, train our students. I think the other thing is that, you know, given all this, uh, the, the, the exciting research being done is that we need to look at a lot of these constructs that, um, that most people vary on across cultures, but that are maybe more salient to certain cultures, like historical trauma, like, like, (inaudible ), and that we don't usually train our students in, in, in terms of those, uh, understanding what those constructs are. But what I really am, uh, uh, surprised by is that we don't have many training models, like the Anti-Counselor Training Model, to really get our students to, we need to challenge our students to sort of, uh, take the perspective, uh, of, of, clients and as, as, uh, Steve(ph) was saying, really get to, uh, where you can negotiate. I want to make a comment real quickly about, uh, that, that, I think that, that we, you know, (inaudible ) and the inauguration of clinical psychological science may say, 'look, most people are not getting mental health services when they really need them.' So, I think that we have to get out of talk therapy, a little bit, to really, you know, when, when we, we need to expand this whole notion of what we mean by therapy, and, and, at UC-Davis, we're looking at how traditional ethnic arts movements, uh, uh, may, uh, enhance, uh, not only ethnic identity, but, uh, uh, counteract depression. And, and, so, a lot of the communities, when we look at them, have activity settings, as (inaudible ) says, that actually are very therapeutic. And we're not really capitalizing on it because we're so oriented to the talk therapy models. So, so, so I love Steve's, uh, and Linda's approach, but I think that we need to get past that and look at, also, alternative models of really delivering behavioral change, interventions, that simply go beyond talking about it. And you know, most Asian patients, they, they don't really understand how talk therapy is going to (inaudible ) uh, get them a job, or, or save their job. And so, so, uh, we need to sort of think outside the box in terms of just what therapy actually is. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Well now that I have the mic, um, I'm going to also make, make a comment, uh, um, uh, which is that I think one of the things that we've been talking about in the last two days, uh, or some of the tension that I've seen is between the issue of the universal and the particular. Uh, because, we're in the business, of course, of developing theories that, uh, uh, ought to be universal, uh, and, and, uh, uh, with developing hypotheses and that we can generalize (inaudible ), but also the tension is with the, with the specifics, with the individual. And with treatment that is useful and helpful to the particular characteristics and needs and, and context of that person. So, I think we go back and forth between those kinds of tensions. Um, and I'm reminded of, uh, of, uh, I think, something that, uh, Fred, uh, wrote about, and also Ricardo, uh, that has to do with, um, um, what was it he, I, yeah, uh, 'every person, in certain respects, is like, uh, all others, uh, like some others, and like no others.' Uh, and that's from Kluckhohne and, uh, uh, what is it, Struckbeck, yeah, Murray, and Murray, from 1953, and that talks about the, the universal, we're like all others. We're like some others as part of the cultural, and we're like no other that we're, we're, we're individuals. And so, then, how do we develop, uh, interventions that, uh, actually address all those aspects? So, when we talk about, um, I think, I think, what, what, what, um, Steve is doing, he's trying to do that in terms of the individual and the individual and (inaudible ) uh, the, the, the patient, uh, the, the treatment, and, uh, and, and, and also as well as (inaudible ) in terms of developing, talking about processes that focus on the individual for a positive outcome. Um, I think the other, um, and I'm going to come back to that in a minute, uh, in a minute. The other, the other aspect of this has to do with, uh, that we've been sort of skirting around, in a sense, the, uh, the issue of social justice, and the issue of the power differential that exists, uh, between the production of psychology, the production of treatments, the production of science, uh, and, and the, and the disparity with, uh, traditional and historically, uh, oppressed. And so, we haven't really talked about oppression, uh, uh, well, we've talked a little bit about it, but really not. So, we're talking about, really, this empowered peoples, uh, uh, so, culture, in a sense, has been a proxy for oppression, has been a proxy for, um, dis-empowered groups. So, so long as we have treatments that have been developed in, uh, um, probably dominantly, up, um, upper middle class, white, uh, or upper middle class groups, and that are being applied massively, as it's being done today and has been done for years, to everybody, and now being exported, internationally, as the treatment that works and is effective. Then we have, we have a serious problem in terms of another form of, uh, uh, of uh, of massification and of acculturation at an international level, uh, not only at the local level. So, I'm concerned about that, and I think that we, some of us, at least, I will be involved in adapting treatments, so that at least the treatments, uh, for some groups, take into consideration, uh, the group aspect, uh, of the, uh, you know, I'm also involved in doing process research, which I didn't talk about at all. Uh, but that's another story, and we'll tell you about that later, um, because I haven't published it yet. So, so I'm also interested in looking at the mechanisms and that kind of stuff because I, we, we all talk to each other, you know, in, in, in certain respects. So, I think that the, the issue of the universe and the particular, and the, the, the, the issue of, uh, of social justice, we really have sort of, have been skirting around that. Um, so, it would be wise to talk about that. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN I think that's what I was going to say as well, I was thinking that, um, 25 years ago, when I was in graduate school, in clinical psychology, and started raising, kind of, these questions, I was told that has nothing to do with psychology. If you want to talk about that stuff, you should go to therapy. Well, I mean, 25 years later we're, we're, we're starting to talk about, there's a, a, a group of us here talking about it, and there's other groups that, you know, are actively engaged, but I think, how do we de-center our students? I, I, I, I think we do have to take more of that social justice kind of approach, we have to, I, I think counseling has, has been doing that for some time, and you can really see the differences in how students really view a lot of these issues, um, and I think that's something (inaudible ) I, I don't know why clinical has not, you know, fully engaged with that (inaudible ). I, I think that, in some ways, we still think, well, that has nothing to do with psychology. Um, but it has everything to do with serving people, that we're all trying to serve, and to do it in ways that are congruent with their world views and their, their experiences. So I, I would say that would, that would be (inaudible ). And, and I, I, I say that as I am thinking of one student who I cannot get to understand that people see things from different way, and it's, it's, I have to say, it has to be a problem, you know, of the, the core of what, what we do in our programs. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN I have one thought. Only one thought. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN That's a good one. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) I've been training clinicians quite a bit lately, and, and I hear a lot of clinicians on cultural competence again, uh, a lot of frustration, and what I hear is, we hear a bunch of stereotypes about groups. And then sometimes we hear that we're racists, and we have to understand our racism. Well, I believe that you can't live in a racist society and not be racist. I mean, I recognize, it's not pleasant, but I recognize some of my racism over my wife's family. It's not pleasant, but do I want to talk about that in a public setting? And will I benefit from learning how racist I am, and telling my partner over here, or whoever, how racist I am? And I just think, sometimes, you know, the, the well-intentioned, thoughtful approaches, can backfire. We have to think about the people who're receiving our training, and what are they going to be opened up to consider? Um, so, we have to learn from their perspective, as well, and take that into account, where they're at, just like a good client, and work accordingly. And sometimes I wonder if we're too strong. That's my, I mean, maybe that's my approach, but, I would not go to a cultural competence training that the focus is on teaching me how racist I am. I, that's, (inaudible ) not something I want to have in a public setting, uh, yeah. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Of course, yeah. Other comments, or thoughts. Hi. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Um, I just want to thank all the speakers for their, um, talks. I've been reading a lot (inaudible )future. Um, I was just thinking, though, um, how else can we improve on the assessment and treatment of ethno-cultural groups. And, um, part of my question was answered, and I was going to ask you about empowerment in assessment and treatment, if that's important, and, you had touched on that social justice is very important in this. And, um, the part that really stuck with me, um, was that, psychopathology can come from colonization, and I was thinking this is not only for ethno-cultural groups; it can be for, um, a person suffering from eating disorder, who is oppressed by media, um, with certain images that are expected of them. So, it can go across cultures. Um, and so, I was wondering, in, um, public health, or other prevention-focused projects, um, empowerment and awareness of, you know, (inaudible ) of your identity as well as, um, social justice issues, how they're approached, these issues, um, is a focus, and I'm wondering how much of that can be brought in to clinical psychology in assessment, um, in a more conspicuous way. Um, so, you know, perhaps, in the, um, interview process, um, there can be some questions about, um, certain ways, maybe not direct, about how discriminated do you feel in this nation, but in a different, more nuanced way, can you guage where that person is at and then try to adapt the treatment process for that person so that it's not just a restoration of your balance, um, or your faith, or, um, more of hope, but also in, in addition to those, empowering that individual. And hopefully, all therapy is empowering individuals already, um, but beyond that, um, really, um, having them come out of therapy, um, becoming a stronger person than they were and feeling like they have the agency to go and do something about it. Um, and also, um, CBT works well enough, um, we're measuring symptom outcomes, and I'm wondering, you know, how much of this can include this empowerment process if we're measuring outcomes in a different way, um, thinking about the long-term quality of life of patients, rather than just symptom reduction? We don't really know much about that. Um, so, just, it's a very loaded question. So, any thoughts about this would be very helpful. Thank you. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Great. Thank you. Comments? Who would like to hold the mic? 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN All right, I'll give it a shot. Peer pressure. So, um, so you asked many questions, uh, (inaudible ) one or two of them that I'd like to talk about, and you asked, your theme was empowerment, right? Am I right about this? 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN Yes, that's right. 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN And then your theme was empowerment within the context of therapy, was that right? Okay. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN So, how can, uh, therapy encourage empowerment? So, let me answer that in a different way, because there's been a lot of research in the field of resilience. So, resilience, we just touched on that, and resiliance is broadly defined as about overcoming adversity. And overcoming adversity can be done in a small way, like you come from a bad relationship and you have to get out, or it can become, come from a big way, like you are born into poverty, you've witnessed domestic violence, you went to a bad school and pe-, the kids beat you up while you were growing up, so there's all kinds of adversity like that. So, resilience, um, was studied by Emmy Werner and she did a study called the Children of Kauai. And the Children of Kauai is a fascinating study started in 1954, there were 654 children born on the island of Kauai. So, at that time, uh, Hawaii wasn't a state, and it became the 50th state in 1960, but it, this study took all these kids. Now, in Kauai, at the time, there were places where there weren't running water, there were places where there were, was no electricity, and most of the families were plantation workers, and these kids came from those kinds of families without running water without electricity, and plantation worker families. They were mixed-race kids, typically. Some Hawaiian, mixed Filipino, a lot of Chinese-Hawaiian, so they were all, all the minority groups mixed. It was a microcosm of society. So, when the children were born, at the age of zero, she got a sample, 654 kids, and she went in and she measured babies, she measured mothers' perception, she made, and she got a lot of proxy measures. So the babies she gave the standardized, uh, infant measurements, the mothers and fathers she gave the standardized parent concern, mental health, blah biddy blah, and then she got the proxy measures, which, uh, around, were about environmental measures and socioeconomic status, et cetera. She did that when the kids were two, she did it when they were ten, she did it when they were 18, she did it when they were 40 years old, and now a woman name Laurie McCoven(ph) met, uh, has gotten the data, and Laurie is trying to get money, or perhaps a government (inaudible ) to do a follow-up on 50-year-olds. So, Emmy's main question is, was, what, how do kids from adversity, uh, live positive and healthy adult, adaptive lives? With all that data, what do you think she found? She did a, a path analysis which was really fascinating. So, she had all that longitudinal data, she had really good follow-up. So, I can tell you some of the findings from that, which will speak to your question about empowerment. The straightest shot to resilience in adversity, uh, from her data, is mother's competence. So, if you're born to a competent mother when you're, like, zero, and your mother's competent, you have a straight shot to adult positive adaptation. So, pos-, adult positive adaptation when you're 40 means you have a job, you haven't been divorced, really, you haven't gone to jail, you haven't been in mental health institutions, stuff like that. But how many of these kids had a competent mother in that situation? Not that many. So what are some of the other ways, from her path analysis, that you can get to positive, healthy adaptation, or, as you call it, empowerment, and as I would call it, resilience, because they were overcoming adversity, or somebody else might call it something else, but, how do you not, kind of, succumb to the bad things in life? So, what she found was that when the kids were ten, there were four factors that really predicted when you didn't have positive, uh, when you didn't have a competent mother. Four factors that predicted positive, healthy adaptation at the age of 18. One of these factors was what she called, uh, let me see her language, was, uh, social, oh, it was, it was a word, it was a phrase that means, uh, that ha-, happy kids who encouraged social, socially positive engagement. Okay, so there are kids who are in her room, you know, and these kids just think, 'oh, what a brat, get this kid out of here.' But then there are other kids that come into the room who are playing, who, who will come up to you and ask you a question, or you will engage in positive interaction with them. So, that's one factor, the ability to elicit positive responses from your environment, from the adults in your environment. Another factor was what she called a close bond with a caretaker, so it doesn't have to be the mom, it doesn't have to be the dad, it could be the older sister. So, in my family, for example, I was the oldest, and I was the, the caretaker of, uh, four brothers and sisters, and, not that it did any good, but, you know, but, a close bond with the caretaker. You know, a, a, a, a, a care, a caregiver of some kind. The third factor was what she called engaging in social re-, socially responsible activity in the household. What that means is it is not so bad for the kids to help out in the house, that girls who had to help with dinner, or boys who had to help with something else, these are, these three factors, and there's a fourth one I actually can't remember, uh, are what encourages, uh, resilience as the kids grow up. So, you call it empowerment, and I would say that when you have a client in a clinical setting who has not yet discovered what their resilience factor is, it would be the client, the therapist's responsibility to help them uncover what that was. And it doesn't take a panorama of things, it takes one thing, because it generalizes to other situations. In an indigenous population, many people, many kids are taught not to value what they've learned, like helping out in the house, or, um, their long history, longstanding history of, of their, of their group, to help somebody learn (inaudible ) is to help them learn how they can uncover their own resilience. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Okay. (inaudible ). 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN How's that? 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN Thank you very much.
