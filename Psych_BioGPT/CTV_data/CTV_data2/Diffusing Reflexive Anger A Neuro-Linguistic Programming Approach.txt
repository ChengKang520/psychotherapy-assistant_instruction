BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief Therapy clearly identifies the therapeutic focus and goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of Brief Therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems. 

00:01:35
DIFFUSING REFLEXIVE ANGER NLP STEVEN ANDREAS THERAPIST 

00:01:45
JON CARLSON I am Jon Carlson. I like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:01:55
DIANE KJOS And I am Diane Kjos and this is our guest Steve Andreas, who is going to talk to us about brief therapy using Neuro-Linguistic Programming or NLP. Steve, just how would you define brief therapy? 

00:02:05
STEVEN ANDREAS , M.A. NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING Brief Therapy is any therapy that’s quick and effective and thorough and lasting. And quickness depends, you know, on a lot of things. I have a videotape where acrophobias less than 7 minutes from saying hello, how are you, they're done. And it’s usually not that fast and obviously some things are gonna take a lot longer than that. And I think it kind of depends on the context, on the kind of problem a person has and so on which you consider brief. 

00:02:35
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

00:02:35
JON CARLSON Well, help us understand your approach to Brief Therapy. Just how does it work? 

00:02:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, fundamentally it works by changing people's experience. And one of the things in NLP is… is sort of based on is the notion that all our experiences are based on visual, kinesthetic, and auditory experiences. That if I had to say to you, can you think of the dog? You make a picture of a dog, you might smell the dog, you might hear the dog bark and have the feel of the… of the dog licking you or something like that. And then basically all of our experiences, the ones that make us successful and the ones that drive us crazy are based on these little elements. Now, beyond that there're even smaller elements within this. It’s sort of like the DNA code of our experiences. Like there're these three basic possibilities most of us don’t spend a whole lot of time smelling and tasting. I mean, it’s important for eating and so on. So when you're making decisions are… are relating to another human being normally that’s… it’s the visual, auditory, kinesthetic. Now, within each of these there are sub-pieces or smaller pieces, so an image can be far away or it can be close, it can be bright or dim. It can be large or small and so on. And these are even smaller pieces, and by chunking it down this way you can change people’s experiences in very quick and easy ways. 

00:04:00
JON CARLSON And you don’t have to send them to Hawaii, you are somewhere to change in experience, you can actually do with a… 

00:04:05
STEVEN ANDREAS We can send them in their mind. 

00:04:05
JON CARLSON Well, how do you do that in therapy? What’s the process that you use to get people to actually bring about this kind of change? 

00:04:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Basically, you just teach them how to do it. It’s a matter of teaching. It's not so much something you do to someone, it's something with someone. And if you know something about the structure of the problem then you can suggest the solution. So, for instance some people are depressed because they have all their happy memories as small, dim, faraway pictures, so they can't enjoy them. And they have all their terrible experiences, as a great huge billboard things right in their face, so they feel terrible all the time. Now, it's kind of a simplistic example that’s it’s one that at least for teaching purposes is often quite useful. If you teach them the reverse side, so the… the horrible experiences that happened to them recede into the distance and they're little small postage stamps. That way they still have the information about what harmed them and what to avoid in the future. So it’s not like amnesia, but it doesn’t bother them. And if they have their rich experiences, the really good ones, up close so they can step into them and have a (inaudible ), then they can have a happier life. But sometimes it sounds too simplistic, but sometimes it’s as easy as that. 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

00:05:20
DIANE KJOS Hmm… 

00:05:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Sometimes it’s not. 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON Is that a cognitive theory, then what you're changing one's thinking? 

00:05:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, primarily. 

00:05:25
JON CARLSON And what’s the way they would think about a problem or think about a situation in which… example you have… 

00:05:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! In terms of other… of other modalities, it's closest to the cognitive behavioral therapy. 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:40
DIANE KJOS Of course this reminds me that when I was a child and my mother would put me to bed and she'd say, now just think about the happy things that happened today. 

00:05:45
STEVEN ANDREAS It's a good idea. I don’t know of the way she said made you do that. 

00:05:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! 

00:05:50
STEVEN ANDREAS But that’s a good program. 

00:05:55
DIANE KJOS Kind of bringing forward the… the past and parts. 

00:05:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, why not? 

00:06:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:06:00
STEVEN ANDREAS I mean, it’s horrible. You know, this horrible things happen to people sometimes and I think it’s too bad that had happened had… that it had to happen to them once, why should it have to happen to them over and over again. 

00:06:10
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:10
JON CARLSON Does your theory have some explanation for how that happens? 

00:06:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:06:15
JON CARLSON You know, in terms of how people reverse these images? 

00:06:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, in terms of how they reverse them, it’s just a matter of teaching them to do it and most people… 

00:06:20
JON CARLSON So they (crosstalk)(inaudible) see these ugly things rather than the good things? 

00:06:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, seeing also the desired program. I mean, the programming comes from the computer model. And when a baby is born in the world it doesn’t come with a manual, what you call the… the manual that teaches you the access codes and the instructions and so on. So most of us are programmed randomly or we’re programmed by events that simply happen in a kind of a random order. You know, parents do the best they can, but typically they do exactly the wrong thing. One woman, I know, had a phobia, because the parents would hold her next to a wall and say, “look, you can see how you could fall.” And they install that phobia. Now, they were… they were trying to protect her. They were trying to do a good thing, but the words they said literally programmed her have a phobia of, when she looked over an edge she could see how she could fall and then she felt that. 

00:07:10
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:10
JON CARLSON So then is essentially these problems occur through programming and all you are doing then is reprogramming? 

00:07:20
STEVEN ANDREAS You can think of reprogramming has some other meanings. That word has meanings in terms of cults and religions. 

00:07:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! 

00:07:25
STEVEN ANDREAS But, yeah, basically it’s teaching people to do a different sequence. 

00:07:30
DIANE KJOS What… What are the roots of a basis and what influenced you to… to go in this direction? 

00:07:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I used to be in gestalt therapy. I did that for about eight or ten years with Fritz Perls and that was all diving into the feelings and emoting into the future thing and all the rest of it and I still think that at the things that were available at that time it was perhaps one of the better ones. But, you know, he just works so much faster with much less fuss and bother. And in terms of the roots of it, the roots are primarily Milton Erickson and Virginia Satir, were probably two of the finest therapists that ever lived. You know, I will say that without reservation. They were both marvellous. And I had the pleasure of being with both of them a little bit from time to time in studying their work. A lot of NLP is derived from their work, a lot of principles. And in terms of what NLP is, it’s really hard to say, again because it takes kind of a mindset of thinking about things in a different way. If I asked you to define physics, where would you start? There are so many physical principles. There are mass and momentum and energy and the interplay of all those things and all the rest of it. And it’s really hard to get across that NLP isn’t just kind of a new gimmick or a new thing or a new… slightly different approach. For instance, years ago a very sweet guy named Sid Jourard really worked on transparent person. 

00:08:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:08:55
JON CARLSON Sure! 

00:08:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And the basic idea was ridiculously simple, it’s be honest, be direct, be transparent so that there is no… nothing hidden. 

00:09:05
JON CARLSON What you see is what you hear? 

00:09:05
STEVEN ANDREAS So won… Yeah, what you see is what you get. Now, it’s a wonderful idea and I heard he was a real sweet guy. I never met him. I’ve heard nothing but good things about him, which is really unusual. NLP is much, much more than that. It’s a set of principles and understandings that continues to evolve and develop that… We claim, may be optimistically, can be used to understand any human behaviour including sports, business communication, relationships, interpersonal, intrapersonal etc. And I can give you a couple of examples. There are some… We care phobias by doing a particular thing. There is a (inaudible ) who does phobias by teaching people to go through them very quickly. So she says, “and then, and then, and then”, and she teaches people to go through the phobia very quickly. She doesn’t cure the phobia, but they go through it so fast that it doesn’t hurt very bad. There is another guy, I think his name is Brian Weiss or Wise who does past life regressions. 

00:10:05
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:05
STEVEN ANDREAS And he claims to cure phobias. Well, he does it by… At the end of this past lives regression, people have a sense of this immense series of lives and here is this little life here and within that is this little phobia. And it’s so small that it doesn’t bother them anymore. 

00:10:20
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:20
STEVEN ANDREAS  They still have it and watch ‘em and they still kind of twitch a little bit, but it’s so small in this large perspective and we call it a perspective pattern. And so we claim that we can look at any kind of process and… and analyse it in terms of the kinds of patterns that are involved, the presuppositions that people are using that underlie the work, the kinds of elements that they do. So, it’s like physics can be used to build bridges, can be used to build bombs. 

00:10:50
JON CARLSON Sure! 

00:10:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Or… Or do, you know, bone replacements and so on and the principles can be used in lots of different ways. 

00:11:00
JON CARLSON Well, how did Steve Andreas aka John Stevens get to be a neuro-linguistic program personal… 

00:11:05
STEVEN ANDREAS I’m just working my bunds off. 

00:11:10
JON CARLSON Yeah, but that too but. 

00:11:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I learned as much as I could and at a certain point in my life and I started generating new patterns. 

00:11:15
JON CARLSON And is there an education, just you go get a doctorate in NLP? 

00:11:20
STEVEN ANDREAS No, no, it’s not in the universities, not in the universities Jon. Few… A few places Jon, sometimes sort of sub rosa sort of… 

00:11:30
DIANE KJOS Sub Rosa! Alternative methods or alternative subjects. 

00:11:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, and sometimes you don’t… they don’t say what it is. 

00:11:30
DIANE KJOS Call that! Yeah, good! 

00:11:35
STEVEN ANDREAS But… But it’s the same process, yeah. Now, I just… I just went to the… like two guys in development, Richard Bandler and John Grinder. They were the first developers and there were a bunch of, you know, a generations after them. 

00:11:45
JON CARLSON Ah…Ah… 

00:11:45
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And still learning there’s lots to be learned. I mean, we probably know that much about so far, but it’s a lot, you can really go on. 

00:11:55
DIANE KJOS How does this compared with other brief therapy approaches is it (crosstalk)(inaudible)… 

00:11:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, the way you mentioned this, it’s pretty… it’s close in a lot of ways to cognitive behavioural. They do a lot of rehearsal. They do, you know, imagine this and visualize this. But knowing more about the mechanics of it, we could do things a lot faster and lot more effectively, I think, I claim, you know, I mean, who knows. The other particular development is solution-focus people. 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON Sure! 

00:12:20
STEVEN ANDREAS There’s a lot of parallels there. Searching for the solutions rather than problems, working without positive outcomes rather than problems. 

00:12:30
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON Okay, talk a little bit about the structure that takes place. When you actually do NLP or NLP therapy, are there stages or are there phases that one goes through it? 

00:12:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, yes and no, because all these things are happening at once. I mean, as I’m talking to you, I’m gesturing, I’m changing my tone of voice or I’m making pictures and so and so. Really it all happens at once. When we… When we teach people how to do this, we chunk it down into a lot of different processes. One is simply understanding the presuppositions of people we use. 

00:13:05
JON CARLSON So that’ll be like the first step, trying to understand? 

00:13:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I’d say, in working with a client the first step really is finding out what their positive outcome is. And most clients come in with a negative outcome. “I don’t want this. I don’t wanna get angry. I don’t wanna yell at my wife.” I don’t, it’s all negative. 

00:13:20
JON CARLSON Okay, so they gotto get a road map, so they know where they’re headed to? 

00:13:25
STEVEN ANDREAS They need a picture to start going for. 

00:13:25
JON CARLSON Okay! 

00:13:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Or some kind of an image. 

00:13:25
DIANE KJOS A goal? 

00:13:30
STEVEN ANDREAS A goal. 

00:13:30
DIANE KJOS Positive goal? 

00:13:30
STEVEN ANDREAS A positive goal, rather than being immersed in the problem. I mean, okay, that’s a problem, I understand that hurts, you don’t like that. Now, what is it that you do want? And this is again straight out of Virginia Satir. 

00:13:40
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:40
STEVEN ANDREAS She would always do that. People would come in with problems, you say, “okay, that’s what you don’t want, what do you want?” 

00:13:45
JON CARLSON Okay! 

00:13:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And notice the hand gestures. 

00:13:45
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:50
STEVEN ANDREAS You see, that’s just something totally automatic to me now. “That’s what you don’t want, what do you want?” 

00:13:55
DIANE KJOS Ah! 

00:13:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And it’s saying, you know, “(inaudible ) you don’t want” and they put their picture there and you go like this and you say, “what do you want?” And you make an opportunity for a new picture. 

00:14:05
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, that’s what I mean when I say, it’s all simultaneous, that in terms of a step wise process, yes, I can talk about that, but it’s really everything that’s happening at once. 

00:14:15
JON CARLSON So, you establish quite early on with that positive goal is that traction, you wanna go, then what? 

00:14:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Then we start going toward it and we start trying it out. And that’s a key thing again out of Virginia Satir. She would repeatedly go, “well, try it out. You wanna say this to your husband, blah, blah, blah, Try it out, how does it work? Find out how that person responds.” And they call it road testing. 

00:14:40
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:40
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Just try it out and we find out what doesn’t work or what objections there are, deal with the objections, find a way that the objections can support the general outcome or adjust the outcome so that the… so the outcome is… is met. 

00:14:50
JON CARLSON Okay, so sort of a behavioural process, you go through it, they call successive approximation. 

00:14:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Yes! 

00:14:55
JON CARLSON You keep trying to move towards that… 

00:15:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:15:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:15:00
JON CARLSON …eventual goal. 

00:15:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

00:15:00
JON CARLSON How does neuro-linguistic programming, they’ll do this differently than say behaviour modern which I’d give you an M&M or something that you’d want as you performed well on that, you know, that behaviour (crosstalk)(inaudible)? 

00:15:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, there are some parallels there, but M&Ms are kind of clumsy and people get associated with them and… 

00:15:20
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:20
STEVEN ANDREAS We use as the M&Ms people’s feeling good about reaching their goal or progress toward it. That’s… The M&Ms are built in, you really don’t need an extrinsic motivation. 

00:15:30
JON CARLSON So how do you do that? I mean, how do you, you know, structure those road test as you call them? 

00:15:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, we just start out, “how would you like to feel in that situation? How would you like to behave in that situation? Can you see what that would like?” And sometimes people can’t generate that right away, so you say, “well, do you have a friend who can do this?” “Oh yeah, I’ve a friend Bill who can do this.” 

00:15:50
JON CARLSON So you use a visual friend. 

00:15:50
STEVEN ANDREAS “Can you see… Can you see Bill doing this?” 

00:15:50
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:55
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, and then you can… you can do step-wise chunking of visualization. So you can say, “now, did you like what Bill did there, and let’s say going up to a girl and introducing himself or something like that?” “Oh yeah, he… he does it great. He’s so smooth.” “Great! Now, take that same movie and now put yourself in there, so you see your body, so you adjust the picture so that it’s you doing that. Now, how do you like that?” Because there might be adjustments that you need to make to fit with your personality and your… who you are. So you keep running movies like that until they like it. 

00:16:25
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:25
STEVEN ANDREAS And then you can have ‘em get into the movie so that rather than seeing it out there they’re actually inside it… 

00:16:30
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:30
STEVEN ANDREAS …doing the moves and whatever. 

00:16:35
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:35
STEVEN ANDREAS And you test again. “Well, how did that go? Did you have any hesitations or how did it work? How did the girl respond?” And so on and you just literally build experience like that until you find a chunk that works. 

00:16:45
JON CARLSON And… And you really stick with the visual. They have to get a visual picture or rather think that you might say, what does it sound like or what does it feel like? 

00:16:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Absolutely! Well, we’re interested in the feelings to know how well it works. That’s the evaluation part. 

00:17:00
JON CARLSON That's the kinaesthetic modality? 

00:17:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! And there are two elements… two chunks in the kinaesthetic modalities, so if you’re teaching someone to play golf for instance, what you’re really interested in is the kinaesthetic, so how the muscles feel, you know, as you take that swing. 

00:17:15
JON CARLSON Okay! 

00:17:15
STEVEN ANDREAS And literally all good athletes do this. 

00:17:20
JON CARLSON Right! 

00:17:20
STEVEN ANDREAS They make a picture of some, Sam Snead or whoever doing golf… 

00:17:20
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:20
STEVEN ANDREAS …and then they just step into it and they feel the muscles in their body and they fit right into it. 

00:17:25
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

00:17:30
STEVEN ANDREAS And then they bang on. 

00:17:30
JON CARLSON Actually research shows that those muscles twitch. 

00:17:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:17:30
DIANE KJOS Hmm… 

00:17:30
JON CARLSON That subliminal level… 

00:17:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:17:35
JON CARLSON …which they don’t even move. 

00:17:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:17:35
JON CARLSON And so you get that image then. For the first, you get the positive outcome. 

00:17:40
STEVEN ANDREAS With… With the auditory too. 

00:17:40
JON CARLSON Okay! 

00:17:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, with golf there wouldn’t be a whole lot of auditory, but if you’re talking to someone in their way. 

00:17:45
JON CARLSON That sweet sound of the ball. 

00:17:50
STEVEN ANDREAS The sweet sound of the ball or whatever. 

00:17:50
JON CARLSON Right! 

00:17:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:17:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:17:50
JON CARLSON Might be one that you’d play on, so really to make the learning complete… 

00:17:55
STEVEN ANDREAS You wanna use all systems. 

00:17:55
JON CARLSON …so you probably not only get the picture you get the feeling and you’ll also get this, you know. 

00:18:00
STEVEN ANDREAS I use image in a somewhat sloppy way as… as not… sometimes just as a visual image but usually as a visual image with all the rest. 

00:18:10
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:10
STEVEN ANDREAS And we tend to be a fairly visual culture. And one of the… one of the things about the visual system is that you can represent a great deal of information simultaneously. 

00:18:15
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:20
STEVEN ANDREAS In one picture… You know, one picture is worth a thousand words. 

00:18:20
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:20
STEVEN ANDREAS In the auditory system it’s sequential. 

00:18:25
JON CARLSON Okay! 

00:18:25
STEVEN ANDREAS So, you can’t represent a whole lot of information in the auditory system. In the visual system you can get a whole bunch all at once and then add in the auditory… 

00:18:30
JON CARLSON Yeah, okay! 

00:18:35
STEVEN ANDREAS …add in the kinaesthetic. 

00:18:35
JON CARLSON That’s where you might start? 

00:18:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Typically! 

00:18:35
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

00:18:35
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, different people have different preferences. Some people have difficulty visualizing and then we have a method called the As If Frame. You say, “well, pretend you could visualize.” And usually that’s all the text. 

00:18:50
DIANE KJOS Well, that brings me to… to another question and that is, are there… are there different kinds of clients that this just work with? And what I was thinking as you were talking about the visualization, what if somebody doesn’t see? 

00:19:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, the hardest involved(ph) is psychiatrist. 

00:19:00
DIANE KJOS Oh! 

00:19:00
STEVEN ANDREAS  And mostly that’s because they’ve such a belief system and the change is slow and that this is the way to do it rather than this or something like that. 

00:19:10
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

00:19:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Some people have difficulty reporting on their internal experience and sensations and visualizations and so on. So yeah, there are some people it doesn't work as well with, but it’s a fairly small percentage, 5 to 10% percent, maybe you have do a little education about what… what’s going on in there. And for most people that’s the case. If… If I ask you to imagine a friend of yours, you can do that, right? 

00:19:35
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:35
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:35
STEVEN ANDREAS  Now, if I say, “now, is that a still picture or a movie?” Probably I’ve to go inside and check. 

00:19:45
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Because it’s not a usual thing that people would ask. 

00:19:45
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And yet, when you go and say, “is it hard to do? 

00:19:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah, they just… 

00:19:50
STEVEN ANDREAS You just go inside, “Oh, yeah, it’s a still or it’s a movie?” 

00:19:55
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And so mostly it’s just introducing people to this world, which is for the most part unconscious or preconscious or not fully conscious. And it’s that level where we can make these really fast changes. 

00:20:10
JON CARLSON I’ve seen neuro-linguistic programming work and I’ve experienced it myself and yet there is a part of me that wants to know is there research that supports my observations? 

00:20:20
STEVEN ANDREAS I can satisfy that part instantly, there is no research. So, no… Actually there’s a fair amount of research but most of it is badly done, most of it is done on trivial, inconsequential pieces of NLP. And basically the answer is no. There is no research that I would point to with any kind of sense of certainty or pride or anything and say, yeah, this is backed up by research, no. 

00:20:45
JON CARLSON And is that something that will happen in the future? 

00:20:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I hope so. You know, it takes a lot of money to do these studies and most of us who are involved in NLP are too busy, you know, going out further extending the frontier… 

00:21:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:21:00
JON CARLSON Huh…huh… 

00:21:00
STEVEN ANDREAS …to wanna hang around and… and do research, but it needs to be done. It’s certainly… I mean, I come from hard science background. I’ve got a bachelors in chemistry from Caltech and I know a little bit about research design from grad school in psychology and so on. It needs to be done, hasn’t really been done, yeah. 

00:21:20
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… Yeah! 

00:21:20
DIANE KJOS Well, I think in a few minutes we’re gonna be watching this video of you working with a woman who comes in really with anger as the issue. And… And I’m curious as to what… How do you prepare and what do you think about prior to working with a client? 

00:21:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, that’s easy. I think… Well, I try to think about as little as possible, because… I mean, I didn’t have any information on her, about her before she sat down and say, “well, what would you like?” It’s a little bit about how I work. And I wanna be as open as possible to her, so if anything I do a little Zen meditation or something like that to clear any clutter out of mind and just really be open to that person and what they want to do and so on. 

00:22:05
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… As our viewers who’re watching this segment in your work with Melissa, are there things that you could think you like them to pay particular attention to, in terms of how you’re working with her? 

00:22:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s a very… it’s a nice tape. I’m very pleased with it. I’d like you to watch… I guess I’d want people to watch her responses, because that’s really where the answer is. 

00:22:25
JON CARLSON Okay! 

00:22:25
STEVEN ANDREAS I can try a wonderful intervention and if it falls flat it falls flat. 

00:22:30
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:30
STEVEN ANDREAS And there are times and there were I suggest a new way of looking at things or a different way of thinking about things. And she’s pretty responsive for the most part. And for the most part she goes, “oh!” Or she… she… You can see the change happening in her. So back to your initial question, how fast is brief therapy? Instantaneous! 

00:22:50
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:50
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

00:22:50
STEVEN ANDREAS But it may be a little tiny piece. It isn’t the whole piece that they want. So I see changes, lots of little changes, lots of little pieces that then eventually… It’s like building a house. You put a brick on top of a brick and you put some cement on it and… and you build and eventually you get the whole house, but the little pieces are very fast. 

00:23:10
JON CARLSON So as… as a viewer, I’m gonna watch the client, I’m gonna to watch Melissa. Help me a little bit to know what to look for? I mean, what are you looking at, as I think we often say, watch her… 

00:23:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Sure! 

00:23:20
JON CARLSON …then I think everybody is gonna watch a different part. They’re gonna… 

00:23:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:23:25
JON CARLSON May be they’ll pay attention to the content or maybe somebody will watch the process. What are you watching? 

00:23:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I'm watching as much as I can, but particularly facial shifts, breathing shifts, expressiveness. 

00:23:40
JON CARLSON Her facial shifts, expression, breathing? What is breathing? How do you tell that? 

00:23:45
STEVEN ANDREAS You just watch. People breathe… When… When people are feeling… It’s part of the whole parasympathetic relaxation that when people are moving toward an outcome and away from a… and a problem state, they’re gonna be tense, the reading typically of shallow, there’ll be more tension, there’ll be more tension on the face as you go through a parasympathetic response, which is more than relaxation, all things are okay, you get a broadening, the shoulders come down, the… the chest relaxes, breathing is typically deeper, more belly breathing rather than high chest breathing. People breathe… They’ll appear in stress and… and more rapidly and so on. I mean, I could go on for hours. 

00:24:25
JON CARLSON And so you can see that by watching the close move? 

00:24:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, sure! 

00:24:25
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:25
JON CARLSON And then we’ll watch the face, the expressions, the… the muscle tension? 

00:24:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Because… See that’s… that's what I’m watching to know whether something has worked or not. 

00:24:35
DIANE KJOS The change in color on the face I would say. 

00:24:40
STEVEN ANDREAS The change in color and movement and activity and so on. 

00:24:40
JON CARLSON So, they’re not gonna pay so much attention to the actual content as we are (crosstalk)(inaudible)? 

00:24:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s kind of nice to know a little bit about content, to know what’s inducing the changes or what’s leading to the changes. 

00:24:55
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

00:24:55
STEVEN ANDREAS But it’s more process than content. 

00:24:55
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And… And in particular notice her when… well, at one point I’m asking her to visualize two different people in two different space… spaces and how she behaves in one and how she does in the other and so on. And when shifts are suggested by me, I see try out this or… or try saying this to your so and so and there’s any shifts that go on there, because that’s really where the answer is. 

00:25:20
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:20
STEVEN ANDREAS I can be brilliant and do wonderful stuff and if that person doesn’t respond then it ain't brilliant, then it ain't wonderful. 

00:25:30
JON CARLSON Well, let’s watch now and see the process of neuro-linguistic programming takes place. 

00:25:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Which is an awful mouthful and I apologize for the name, but it's great stuff. 

00:25:40
JON CARLSON Thanks! 

00:25:40
DIANE KJOS Thanks Steve. 

00:25:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay Melissa, we just sat down here and got wired up and you just told me you had tons of therapy and that’s… and that’s too bad, because… What I do is a little different some… in some ways. And what I’d like you to do is think about a question. What changes you’d like to make today? And as you do thinking about that, I’ll talk a little bit about how I work with people. Number one, I don’t think the therapy is something that you do to somebody else, I think it’s… think of it more as education and… So I think about it mostly as teaching people how to use your brains. There’re some people’s brains drive nuts and other people make some creative and happy and so on. And another difference between what I do and what a therapy is that I don’t really care how… why things got the way they are, I’m more interested in how people have their problems or… or whatever is going on with them and if I know enough about how things work then we can make some little adjustments with your permission and… and do things. And that brings up another thing. It’s perhaps the most important part of my little preamble here, that if any time during this session, we’ve got 45 minutes, anything happens that you don’t like or you have any consents about, you just tell me… 

00:27:00
MELISSA Okay! 

00:27:00
STEVEN ANDREAS  …and we stop. I don’t mind encourage you to continue, but under no circumstances am I interested in pushing you to do something you don’t wanna do. 

00:27:10
MELISSA Okay! 

00:27:10
STEVEN ANDREAS In fact, I’m only interested in making changes that every part of you feels good about. It’s really important, because otherwise the changes won’t last. So, what kind of changes would you like to make today? 

00:27:25
MELISSA I’m very angry. 

00:27:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Angry! 

00:27:30
MELISSA I have a lot of anger that I tend to explode at people. 

00:27:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:27:35
MELISSA I… I mean, over stupid things. I can never slow myself down… 

00:27:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:27:45
MELISSA …before I explode. 

00:27:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Great! 

00:27:45
MELISSA I mean, it’s this wage of anger. 

00:27:45
STEVEN ANDREAS How do you get angry? 

00:27:50
MELISSA Just over what stupid things like… I got angry yesterday because they wouldn’t let me register for school. 

00:27:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:27:55
MELISSA And I was yelling at this woman across the counter and she’s like, “ma’am I can't help you!” 

00:28:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay. Now, before you got to the yelling, what did you do inside your brain? 

00:28:05
STEVEN ANDREAS I was… I was thinking of how angry I was and how this was so unfair and how can they do this to me. 

00:28:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And when did that… How did that start? So, what happ… some… You came up with some papers or something? 

00:28:20
MELISSA I came up with some papers and they told me, you cannot register because you’ve to take a prerequisite. And I’m like, but this prerequisite I’ve tested out of. 

00:28:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:28:30
MELISSA I’m in the class above that. 

00:28:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:28:30
MELISSA And even though I haven’t taken that class I still should be able to take this class. 

00:28:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

00:28:35
MELISSA No, like well you’ve to go see counsellor. And I am like, I’m not going to waste my time. 

00:28:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! But you’re going to waste your time being angry? 

00:28:40
MELISSA Right! It’s a habit. 

00:28:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, good! Well, see things that are arbitral are wonderful, because if… if something rolls off in a particular sequence, then if we change that, the whole thing will be habitual throughout your life in other ways too. 

00:29:00
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:29:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, you said something in there about, “it’s unfair?” 

00:29:05
MELISSA It’s like, I was… I was mad, because… I was like… It was like they were doing this purposely to me. 

00:29:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So you were a targeted victim? 

00:29:15
MELISSA Right! 

00:29:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Right? 

00:29:15
MELISSA But I know this not true. But when I am angry, you know. 

00:29:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Well… But how do you think about it? I mean, when you go back to that moment where you go, they’re doing this intentionally, they’re… they’re out get me or whatever was going in there. How do you do that? How do you represent? What kind of pictures do you make? What kind of voices do you have or? 

00:29:40
MELISSA I don’t know. It was just something inside me going, I can’t believe this is happening. I… 

00:29:40
STEVEN ANDREAS “You can’t believe this is happening”, and just before that? 

00:29:50
MELISSA I was… I don’t know. I… I don’t know. 

00:29:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Well, (inaudible ) keys to find out. Close your eyes, go back to this thing where you’re handing the papers and they tell you about how you need to… how this prerequisite and you don’t have it and so on. When does it first start? It’s really important to get things right at the beginning, because then you can send your brain in a whole different direction. 

00:30:15
MELISSA As soon as the word came out of his mouth. 

00:30:20
STEVEN ANDREAS So, he said? 

00:30:20
MELISSA “You don’t have this class. Let me go check with my boss to see if he can overwrite it.” 

00:30:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… And then? 

00:30:25
MELISSA And then when he walked away… 

00:30:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:30:30
MELISSA …I’m thinking… 

00:30:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:30:30
STEVEN ANDREAS …I can do this class. Don’t tell me I can’t do this class. And I was like… Then it just kind of snowballed and I was just like… 

00:30:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! And we want to catch the first little piece of the snowball. 

00:30:45
MELISSA Right! 

00:30:45
STEVEN ANDREAS So, where does it start? Right after you? 

00:30:45
MELISSA Right after you start, you can’t do that. 

00:30:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So what is the first thing that goes on in your mind? 

00:30:50
MELISSA Yes I can. 

00:30:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Yes I can? 

00:30:55
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:30:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Take the class? 

00:30:55
MELISSA Yes! 

00:30:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

00:30:55
MELISSA And then it was, how, you know… I can’t… I can't believe this, that’s… 

00:31:05
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s never happened to you before? 

00:31:10
MELISSA What, that I couldn’t take a class or? 

00:31:10
STEVEN ANDREAS That you couldn’t believe that… I mean. 

00:31:10
MELISSA No, it happens to me all the time. 

00:31:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Exactly! So you could believe it, right? 

00:31:15
MELISSA Right! 

00:31:15
STEVEN ANDREAS But you said you couldn’t believe it? 

00:31:20
MELISSA I just get frustrated. 

00:31:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:31:20
MELISSA Oh, I get tensed! 

00:31:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:31:20
MELISSA  Right now I’m getting angry, because I don’t know what to… even how to explain it. 

00:31:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Can you tell me a little more about what’s going on there. If we can really get the… that really beginning of the snowball, that’s where it’ll be most useful. I mean, there are several things I can do even knowing what I already know. 

00:31:45
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:31:45
STEVEN ANDREAS  Because there are certain presuppositions around anger, one of which you mentioned as they’re doing this intentionally, right? 

00:31:55
MELISSA Right! 

00:31:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Did you say something like that to yourself? 

00:32:00
MELISSA No, I just… I was like… 

00:32:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Was that a little later? 

00:32:00
MELISSA That was later. 

00:32:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:32:05
MELISSA That was after I walked away when I was like, I can’t believe you’re doing this to me. 

00:32:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, okay! 

00:32:05
MELISSA How could they do this? 

00:32:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So you definitely had the sense of them doing it to you? 

00:32:15
MELISSA Right! 

00:32:15
STEVEN ANDREAS It wasn’t just a bureaucracy and this is the rules and you have to just find your way through the rules, right? You didn’t see it that way? 

00:32:20
MELISSA Umm…Umm… 

00:32:20
STEVEN ANDREAS So how did you see it? 

00:32:25
MELISSA That I worked really hard to get out of high school early. 

00:32:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:32:30
MELISSA I was a studious student and I took precalculus, that’s the class I need to take, precalculus, and I took it in high school. 

00:32:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:32:40
MELISSA The class I wanna take is physics, I took it in high school. 

00:32:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:32:40
MELISSA I can do these classes. 

00:32:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

00:32:40
MELISSA  I’ve passed these classes. 

00:32:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:32:45
MELISSA And now that I wanna take ‘em at a college level all I wanna do is go look at my transcripts, look at the classes I’ve taken here before. 

00:32:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

00:32:50
MELISSA I am a good student. 

00:32:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

00:32:55
MELISSA Then the rules. 

00:32:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:32:55
MELISSA And it was like, no you have to go see the counsellor and I’m like… 

00:33:00
STEVEN ANDREAS And you know bureaucracies are like that don’t you? 

00:33:00
MELISSA Yeah, but I can’t stand that. 

00:33:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, seeing the choice though given that bureaucracies are like that and you’re probably gonna find this… this is gonna happen again and this happened before, you mentioned that this happens a lot of times, right? 

00:33:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:33:15
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s like the inherent stupidity of the world suddenly puts itself in your face? 

00:33:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:33:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Right? 

00:33:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:33:25
STEVEN ANDREAS So the question is, how would you like to respond to this? 

00:33:25
MELISSA I don’t wanna blow up by people. 

00:33:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! So? 

00:33:30
MELISSA I don’t like to do it. 

00:33:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, if I got on a bus here and I said, I don’t wanna go to Milwaukee and I don’t wanna go to New Orleans and I don’t wanna go to San Francisco, how would the bus driver know where to take me? 

00:33:45
MELISSA Unless you tell him? 

00:33:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! So, where would you like to go? What would you like to do different rather than blow up? 

00:33:50
MELISSA Tell people what the problem is. 

00:33:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:33:55
MELISSA Tell ‘em… 

00:33:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Would you like to feel calm about it? 

00:33:55
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:34:00
STEVEN ANDREAS And realize, you know, there is a lot of stupidity in world, there is a lot of rules, right? 

00:34:05
MELISSA I hate stupid people. 

00:34:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I don’t find them as (inaudible ), but they do exist. 

00:34:11
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:34:15
STEVEN ANDREAS And the question is, would you rather get up, you know, blow up and make a big mess of things or would you like to find your way through the system? 

00:34:20
MELISSA Find my way through the system. 

00:34:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So, how would you like to feel about this? What could you say to yourself or how could you think about this, so that when confronted with bureaucracy and no you can’t do that and so and so and so, so. You just go up, “oh tell me more” or something like that? 

00:34:40
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:34:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Tell me what I need to do, you feel calm and so on and find your way through the system? Would that be okay? 

00:34:50
MELISSA But that’s gonna be hard, yeah, but… 

00:34:50
STEVEN ANDREAS You think it’s gonna be harder than blowing up and getting angry? 

00:34:55
MELISSA No, it’s gonna be hard to stop myself from blowing up and… 

00:35:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And what would make it hard? 

00:35:05
MELISSA Because it’s this habit, this is formed. 

00:35:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, what we can do here is build your new habit. 

00:35:10
MELISSA Okay! 

00:35:10
STEVEN ANDREAS And it’ll run off just the way you want it, just as repetitive way and just as 100% as the habit you’ve already got, will that be alright with you? 

00:35:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:35:20
STEVEN ANDREAS (Inaudible ) doing it? 

00:35:23
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:35:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! How would you like to be able to respond in this situation? Think about it a little bit. Go back to this particular one, it’s always good to have a particular thing that we deal with and then we can always generalize to other examples of the same kind of thing. 

00:35:40
MELISSA I think, I would have liked to said, “okay, I understand, I’ll go talk to the counsellor.” 

00:35:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

00:35:50
MELISSA “Thank you very much.” 

00:35:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:35:55
MELISSA Instead of saying, “I can’t believe you!” 

00:35:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, an outrage. 

00:35:55
MELISSA Yeah! I mean, because it wasn’t the person’s fault. I mean… 

00:36:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, it’s not their’s, they’re just part of the system. 

00:36:00
MELISSA Right! 

00:36:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Right? So, they’re in fact, you’re… you’re acting like your ind… you’re being targeted, right? And here is this poor guy and you’re targeting him. 

00:36:10
MELISSA I know. 

00:36:15
STEVEN ANDREAS He’s just part of the system. 

00:36:15
MELISSA I know. 

00:36:15
STEVEN ANDREAS I can’t believe you’d be that kind of person? 

00:36:20
MELISSA I am. 

00:36:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, close your mind… excuse me, close your eyes. 

00:36:25
MELISSA Okay! 

00:36:25
STEVEN ANDREAS And go back to… so you imagine… re-roll the same movie again, only this time, when you hand over the papers or whatever it was and he tells you, you can’t register and so on, just… you don’t have to tell me anything about it, just tell me how it goes as you imagine doing that. Being calm and just saying, “okay, who do I need to talk to you about this?” Or whatever… whatever is satisfying for you. 

00:36:55
MELISSA Okay! 

00:36:55
STEVEN ANDREAS That’s alright? 

00:37:00
MELISSA I say, “okay, thank you” and then, you know, I walk away. 

00:37:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:37:10
MELISSA I could… I could… I could see that. 

00:37:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:37:10
MELISSA But I don’t think I could ever do that. 

00:37:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, let’s do another piece of that, but that would be satisfying for you, right? 

00:37:20
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:37:20
STEVEN ANDREAS If you could do that you’d be happy, is that right? 

00:37:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:37:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, let’s double-check. Close your eyes and ask inside, is there any part of me that would have any objection to dealing with this kind of situation in this way? And just be sensitive to any feeling or any voice or any picture that might come up or any part of you might object, have any objection to this? 

00:37:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:37:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:37:50
MELISSA There is a part. 

00:37:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… What’s the objection? 

00:37:55
MELISSA That… It’s… It’s their fault and since they are the one to blame. 

00:38:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh you wanna blame somebody? 

00:38:05
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:38:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh! 

00:38:05
MELISSA I wanna yell at somebody, I wanna scream. 

00:38:05
STEVEN ANDREAS What does… What does blaming do for you, blaming somebody else? 

00:38:10
MELISSA It makes people see what they did wrong. 

00:38:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, they’re just following the rules. What are they doing wrong? 

00:38:15
MELISSA I’m not talking about just that situation, I’m talking about everything, like other instances. 

00:38:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, you’d like them to understand that there could be a different way of doing things… 

00:38:30
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:38:30
STEVEN ANDREAS …they’d be more respectful of you. 

00:38:30
MELISSA Right! 

00:38:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that right? 

00:38:30
MELISSA Is that a good way of playing it? 

00:38:30
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:38:30
STEVEN ANDREAS  Okay! Do you think they’re gonna listen to you better if you blow up and get outraged at ‘em or if you were calm? 

00:38:40
MELISSA If I was calm. 

00:38:40
STEVEN ANDREAS I think so. So if you really wanna change your bureaucracy or if you wanna change some other situation or to say somebody else is disrespectful of you, wouldn’t it actually be easier if you could just be calm and centred and self-composed and say, “look, I didn’t like what you did. That doesn’t fit for me. I want you to change it.” 

00:39:05
MELISSA But they don’t listen. They’re never gonna listen. 

00:39:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Sometimes they won’t listen. Do you think they’re gonna listen better if you’re angry or if you’re calm? 

00:39:15
MELISSA Well, how would if I start off calm that I can get angry if they don't listen? 

00:39:15
STEVEN ANDREAS You can always get angry, you’re good at that, you know, you can do that. 

00:39:20
MELISSA I don’t know. 

00:39:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Right? We’re not into taken away choices here. 

00:39:25
MELISSA Okay! 

00:39:25
STEVEN ANDREAS You can always get angry later. And sometimes anger gets people to notice you. But, you know, there’re other times where people would just say, “oh, well, they’re just angry and so they’re just blowing it off”, and they just say, “well, it’s just ‘cos she’s emotional, you know women are…” 

00:39:40
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:39:40
STEVEN ANDREAS That stuff. 

00:39:40
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:39:40
STEVEN ANDREAS You probably got to know once in a while. 

00:39:40
MELISSA Uh…huh… Yeah, right! 

00:39:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So, now check again. Ask if that part, given that part wants to be able to get angry if it want’s to sometime later. Do you have any objection to having this as a general new program or a general new pattern to deal with such situations? 

00:40:05
MELISSA Uh…huh… 

00:40:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Because you know I have a hunch, I know it’s true for me that if I were in one of those official’s positions and someone starts yelling at me, it’ll tend to harden my position. I will go, you know, well it’s (inaudible ) and do anything, sorry, because I wanna get rid of you as soon as I can. 

00:40:25
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:40:25
STEVEN ANDREAS But if you are calm with me and said, you know, well, this is the situation and I took this in high school and so on, so on. I took… and said, you know, lay out whatever the reasons are, I’ll be much more inclined, I think. I know I would be and I think most people would be much more inclined to bend the rules or to try and find a way around the rules or something like that. 

00:40:50
MELISSA Okay! 

00:40:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Does that make sense? 

00:40:50
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:40:50
STEVEN ANDREAS I think it’s true. I mean, check for yourself, close your eyes again and think about running through one of those situations in… 

00:41:00
MELISSA Same situation or any situation? 

00:41:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, take the same one and then take another one. 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! There is one. 

00:41:25
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:41:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, what is it? See, the only way we can make a change that’ll stick it’s if all parts of you are happy. Is there any part of you that’s says, no, no, no, I don’t like that or it’s… it’ll mess with something that I wanna have happen, then it won’t last. So we really need to get all the objections and satisfy them all. So what’s this one? 

00:41:45
MELISSA The other situation? 

00:41:45
STEVEN ANDREAS The other objection. No, you don’t have to tell me the situation. In fact, that’s another thing I should have mentioned about this is, usually we can work more and more… mostly without content. 

00:41:55
MELISSA Okay! 

00:41:55
STEVEN ANDREAS So we don’t need details and names and places and dates and stuff like that. 

00:42:00
MELISSA Okay! Umm… 

00:42:00
STEVEN ANDREAS So you tried it in another situation and there are some rejections there? 

00:42:05
MELISSA No, there’s no objection. I could clearly see how I’d have gotten a benefit… 

00:42:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Gotten more? 

00:42:10
MELISSA Yeah, I got more out of it if I were… 

00:42:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh good! Well, I misinterpreted your expression. 

00:42:15
MELISSA If I were calm down. 

00:42:15
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, this kind of… You’ve this kind of dry look on your face and I thought, oh, another objection, great! Try another one. Think of another one. Would it work better there too? 

00:42:30
MELISSA And all of ‘em. 

00:42:30
STEVEN ANDREAS And all of ‘em? 

00:42:30
MELISSA I… I can… All of these situations from the past that I’ve, you know, gotten so angry… 

00:42:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Blown up? 

00:42:35
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:42:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:42:35
MELISSA I could have… I guess it’s like I want them to understand. 

00:42:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

00:42:40
MELISSA You know, don’t you understand what I’m going through, don’t you understand I’m having problems? 

00:42:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

00:42:45
MELISSA Understand, you know, and don’t you… 

00:42:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And you thought by yelling at ‘em… 

00:42:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:42:50
STEVEN ANDREAS …you could make ‘em understand? 

00:42:50
MELISSA Yeah! This is how I feel. 

00:42:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:42:50
MELISSA This is how angry I feel, okay I understand. 

00:42:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:42:55
MELISSA And… 

00:42:55
STEVEN ANDREAS I think it works better the other way around? 

00:42:55
MELISSA Yeah! I’m starting to see that too. 

00:43:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, great! Now, let’s do a little thing that will help sort of program-listen to your mind to make it really easy for you. 

00:43:10
MELISSA Okay! 

00:43:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Think about what you would see the first time… Well, take these three examples that you just did, so that, was it see or hear, you actually said you can’t do that, is that a key thing? Someone saying you can’t do that or? 

00:43:25
MELISSA No! 

00:43:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:43:25
MELISSA Just the contacts. 

00:43:30
STEVEN ANDREAS What’s common to all those three? 

00:43:35
MELISSA Somebody is preventing me from doing something. 

00:43:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Someone’s preventing you from doing something, someone’s blocking you in some way? 

00:43:40
MELISSA Right! 

00:43:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, great! And how do you… how do you think about a block like that, someone's preventing you? Do you have any kind of image or words or anything? 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:44:00
MELISSA The think that comes out my mind that is too bad to deal with it. 

00:44:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Tough? 

00:44:05
MELISSA Deal with that. 

00:44:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Tough one? 

00:44:05
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:44:05
STEVEN ANDREAS And this kind of shrug and dismissal? 

00:44:05
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:44:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that… Is that part of it? Because when you did it just now there was this kind of little toss of the head. 

00:44:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:44:15
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s like tough luck… tough luck, right? 

00:44:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:44:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, good! Okay! I may shift gears here. I was gonna do one thing and I might do something else, then we have more time to do some other things. Let’s… Let's think of a future situation in which this might happen? Can you can imagine a future possibility may be with somebody who’s bugged you in the past or something like that? 

00:44:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:44:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Run through a future possibility. Close your eyes. Just imagine somebody blocks you in other way and so stuff like that or whatever. This is a road test. 

00:44:55
MELISSA I’m angry. 

00:45:00
STEVEN ANDREAS You’re angry? 

00:45:00
MELISSA I’m angry. 

00:45:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And what does the angry part want for you? 

00:45:05
MELISSA It wants me to hurt that person like they hurt me. 

00:45:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… Okay! So there’s hurt underneath this? 

00:45:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:45:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that blocking you? What’s… What's the route to that? Just come from a long time ago, being hurt in this way? 

00:45:25
MELISSA About a month. 

00:45:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm? 

00:45:30
MELISSA About a month ago. 

00:45:30
STEVEN ANDREAS A month ago! So is there a particular person who hurt you in this way? 

00:45:35
MELISSA My ex. 

00:45:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Your ex! Great! Let’s do a different thing in that? Would you be interested in reaching forgiveness with this person? 

00:45:45
MELISSA I didn’t do anything wrong. 

00:45:45
STEVEN ANDREAS No! I know. I… I believe you. And forgiveness isn’t for the other person, it’s for you so that you wouldn’t have to be… have the feelings of hurt or anger or resentment or revenge. 

00:46:00
MELISSA Right! 

00:46:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that anything would be of interest in you? 

00:46:05
MELISSA I wanna let it go. 

00:46:10
STEVEN ANDREAS You’d like to let it go? 

00:46:10
MELISSA It’s bugging me everyday. 

00:46:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Yeah, that’s the problem with it and that’s… that's why forgiveness is particularly useful in situations like this. Okay! I need a little more information then. When you think of this person, where is the image located? How far away and so on? Tell me more about this image? I… I don’t mean content, I mean like how far away is it, is it… is it big or small? 

00:46:40
MELISSA It’s far right there. 

00:46:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Right there, that’s why you’re looking about here? 

00:46:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:46:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So about this far away? 

00:46:45
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:46:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And how tall? How big? Life size, small? 

00:46:50
MELISSA Life size. 

00:46:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Life size! So it’s like he’s standing right here? Okay, and is there any voices to it? 

00:46:55
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:46:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Good! And I don’t want an… I don’t need the content, but is it like straightened(ph), angry, calm, peaceful, what kind of? 

00:47:05
MELISSA Yelling and screaming. 

00:47:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Yelling and screaming, all good stuff like that, okay! Now, can you think of someone who harmed you in past but you’ve forgiven them? 

00:47:15
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:47:15
STEVEN ANDREAS How do you represent that person? 

00:47:20
[sil.] 

00:47:25
MELISSA My mom. 

00:47:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And… And where is… And you think of your mom, whom you’ve forgiven, where is she? Is she in the same location or something different in your personal space? 

00:47:40
MELISSA She’s closer. 

00:47:40
STEVEN ANDREAS She’s closer? Okay! Where? 

00:47:45
[sil.] 

00:47:50
MELISSA I don't know. I’d say, may be right next to me. 

00:47:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Right here? 

00:47:55
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:47:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And close to you? This… And I hear your voice change, so there’s a little softness there, right? 

00:48:00
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:48:00
STEVEN ANDREAS So I believe you, you have forgiven her. Some people, they've sort of forgiven but not, but I hear in your voice that you really have forgiven her. There is a softness and a warmth there. Okay, great! Now, here is the… here is the hard part, this is the easy part. 

00:48:20
MELISSA Great! 

00:48:20
STEVEN ANDREAS And we lead into the hard part and with lots of warning. If you wanna forgive this person here, one way to do it is to represent him over here close and so on in the same way that you represent your mom. Now, I don’t think you’re unwilling to do that right now, most people are, right? 

00:48:40
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:48:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, what are your objections? Where do the objections get in? 

00:48:45
MELISSA I hate him. 

00:48:45
STEVEN ANDREAS For what he did? 

00:48:50
MELISSA I hate him for lying. 

00:48:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:48:50
MELISSA I hate for the way I was treated. 

00:48:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:49:00
MELISSA And… Yeah, that’s about it. 

00:49:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, this may be, take a little while to get this understanding across, but the first thing I wanna mention is, I assume you had some warm feelings for this person as well, okay, but he violated some of your values in ways that are very important for you to maintain, right? 

00:49:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:49:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, how… how long did you know this person? 

00:49:25
MELISSA Eight months. 

00:49:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Eight months! So you know him pretty well? 

00:49:30
MELISSA I thought I did. 

00:49:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, now you know him better. 

00:49:30
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:49:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Not in the way you wanted, but… 

00:49:35
MELISSA No! 

00:49:35
STEVEN ANDREAS …but now you know him better. Usually in blame there is a presupposition that he could have done differently. 

00:49:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:49:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, I think may be with some therapy or some knock alongside of the head or something like that he could probably do differently? 

00:49:55
MELISSA Probably. 

00:49:55
STEVEN ANDREAS But, at his time he was who he was, he did what he did and you needed to maintain your values, whatever went on violated your values, right? And you needed to, sorry, this is it. Can you understand that he couldn’t have any different than he did? 

00:50:15
MELISSA No! 

00:50:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! When you try and said another one. Can you think of sometime in the past when you harmed someone else? May be telling unintentionally or whatever and now looking back on it I assume you’ve some regret, alright? 

00:50:30
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:50:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, at the moment that you harm them, could you’ve done anything different? 

00:50:35
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:50:40
STEVEN ANDREAS I don’t think so. This is for your self-forgiveness that… I have the idea, crazy or not, that everybody always does the best they can, given their knowledge, given their background, given their habits, their economics and so on… and so on so. People make the best choices they can at the time. Then I think that you made the best choice you could at that time, given what you knew at that moment even though it resulted in harming someone? 

00:51:10
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:51:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that true? Does that make sense to you? But at that moment in time, maybe 10 seconds later you go, “oh, I could have done different!” But at that moment you made the best choice you could. Now, I don’t know what kind of fears this person had or what kind of insecurities or what lead this person to lie to you. But I’d believe that if he was in the room here, we could find out what was it that lead him to think that that was the best choice that he could make in that situation. 

00:51:50
MELISSA How do you know what it is? 

00:51:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Do you? Okay, so you’ve some understanding, some compassion? 

00:51:55
MELISSA Some compassion. 

00:52:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

00:52:00
MELISSA But I still hate him. 

00:52:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, he still did something that hurt you? The question is whether you’re willing to let go with that? What we could do or say it to make that possible for you? 

00:52:15
MELISSA Honestly one part for me doesn’t wanna let it go. 

00:52:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:52:20
MELISSA For a fear that if I ever see him again. 

00:52:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Which would be susceptible again? 

00:52:25
MELISSA No, that I just wanna being a one, I don’t forgive you, I… I hate you, I can’t believe you did this. 

00:52:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

00:52:30
MELISSA It’s that revenge thing. 

00:52:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

00:52:35
MELISSA But then there’s part of me that want’s let it go. 

00:52:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now what would revenge do for you? 

00:52:40
MELISSA Make me feel better. 

00:52:45
STEVEN ANDREAS That’d make you feel better. I’d like you to feel better. I don’t think revenge is a best way to do it, it’s a way. Now, tell me… tell me this. Close your eyes and go into wild revenge fantasies, what would you do if you have… if you were totally omnipotent and you had all the power in the world and you could take revenge on this guy and be into a bloody pop or whatever. How would that make you feel? 

00:53:15
MELISSA Like I won. 

00:53:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So, would you feel stronger? 

00:53:25
MELISSA No, I'd sad feel equal. 

00:53:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Equal! So you feel unequal now? 

00:53:30
MELISSA I want him to feel the hurt that I felt. 

00:53:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! And that would make you feel equal? 

00:53:35
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

00:53:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Is there any other way that you could feel equal to him or even superior? Because you know, forgiveness is something that not many people can accomplish. It takes a good deal of strength, of character and compassion and a lot of human qualities. 

00:54:00
[sil.] 

00:54:05
STEVEN ANDREAS No sale? 

00:54:05
MELISSA What? 

00:54:05
STEVEN ANDREAS No sale? 

00:54:05
MELISSA No sale. 

00:54:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, you might have to go on the feeling, you know, (inaudible ) angry at every… rest of the world, which isn’t quite fair to them either. I mean, he wasn’t fair to you. I guess fairness is a big thing for you, right? It’s for me too. Now, I wanna tell you a story about Milton Erickson. Do you… Have you heard of him? He’s a great medical hypnotist and a great therapist. 

00:54:35
MELISSA Probably in psycho I wanna to have. 

00:54:40
STEVEN ANDREAS He was… He was a doctor in a mental hospital and he was doing regular physical exams of… of the various staff and the patients and also the candy stripers, the (inaudible ) on women who are helping out. And he examined this 75-year-old alcoholic, you’ve been a trouble to the world for most of his years and probably would live another 20 years. The guy was in good health and he examined him and send him out and then he examined a candy striper and the candy striper was 16 and he looked into her eyes with, you know, little gadgets and so on and he found unmistakable signs of that fatal disease and then she’d only live six months. And he had to leave the room to get his composer. And as he says that, he said he went out and he says, “get… get this through your head Erickson, life is not fair.” Before he could come in and then he had to tell this young woman that she had six months to live. Now, that doesn’t stop us from trying to be as fair as we can. And to the best we can in our relationships to be fair and to be honest, but life is fundamentally not fair. Look around you, some people are in wheelchairs, some people aren’t here. Does that make any difference in your understanding of this person over here? Probably life wasn’t fair to him either. 

00:56:30
MELISSA Yeah, I know. 

00:56:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Close your eyes. Stay with that feeling for a little while. Now, this one other piece that I’m sure would be very important here, before you would be willing to forgive him. You would need to be protected, because if you forgave him, you might be tempted to go back with him on the same basis that you were before and then you would be vulnerable to the same kind of treatment again. Does that make sense to you? So you would need to feel assured in yourself that if you forgave him, you would need to have some kind of resolution about, you know, “I’m sorry this happened and I’m sorry he had to be who he was and so on, but that’s not what I want in my life.” Or something like that so that you’d be safe, because sometimes you know this happens all the time in battered women and stuff, they forgive their husbands, they go right back in, they get beat up again, you don’t want that, right? You know, do you have a sense, if you close your eyes and imagine going into the future and imagine that you felt the same toward him as you do towards your mother. Do you feel safe? Is there any danger? 

00:58:00
MELISSA There is that danger that I would go back. 

00:58:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And what could you… What could we do here that would make that no longer a danger? That you might recog… For instance I’m just gonna talk on a little violent and you do whatever you want to. That if you tell in your mind clearly, here is a person who had many qualities that I liked, we had many good times together, but lying is just, it’s a no-no, I don’t like that, I don’t want that to be a… to be a part of my life, unless I was totally assured that… that absolutely would not happen in the future. I just don’t wanna have… I just… I could talk to this person and I can say, hello, well I just don’t wanna be in a relationship with this person. Is there any kind of arrangements like that that you could make inside yourself so that if you go into the future and you think about being with this person without hate and without anger, would it still be safe from any kind of future repetitions of that? 

00:59:10
MELISSA Yeah! 

00:59:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Close your eyes, go into the future and imagine that you’ve done that. And you meet him on camp or sort of wherever you’d be likely to meet him. And just road test what we’ve done here. 

00:59:30
[sil.] 

00:59:35
STEVEN ANDREAS What is it like being with him? Is it easy for you to maintain whatever distance is important to you or whatever protection? 

00:59:45
MELISSA Yeah! I can… I can do it. 

00:59:50
STEVEN ANDREAS “But”, I heard a “but” in your voice? 

00:59:55
MELISSA But it’s like I put on this… this fun, you know, of being happy and… 

01:00:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, that… that I don’t recommend this. Can you do it another way? Can you… In here you would express in compassion for him, right? What if you talk to him like that? What if you told him about how badly he hurt you, but then a voice that was not angry and blaming but just talking about yourself, just to let him know, because that’s important to you, isn’t it, to let him know that? But in such a way that you are telling him about yourself, not blaming him, saying, look, when you lied to me or whatever it was, blah, blah, blah, boy that was like a knife in my heart, or how would you’ll describe it, so that he could know what if impact he’s having on the world? 

01:00:50
[sil.] 

01:00:55
STEVEN ANDREAS My guess is you’d like to protect somebody else from this, wouldn’t you? 

01:01:00
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:01:00
STEVEN ANDREAS In the future if he’s with somebody else, would you want them to go through the same thing you went through? 

01:01:05
MELISSA Uh…huh… 

01:01:10
STEVEN ANDREAS So, you’d like to have an impact on him, right, even if you never see him again? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could say, “hey, that didn’t work for me, that hurt like hell”, or whatever your words would be and make him understand that what he did, didn’t fit for you? 

01:01:30
[sil.] 

01:01:35
MELISSA I think I can do it. 

01:01:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Imagine in your mind. Close your eyes. Imagine doing that with him and notice how he responds. Notice where the conversation goes that you be clear that your central focus is on letting him know your experience, because if you start blaming him, he’ll probably just get uptight and turn away or disappear. But if you’re just there telling him how do you feel, there is a chance that he listens, I can’t guarantee you. 

01:02:15
[sil.] 

01:02:25
STEVEN ANDREAS How was that going, you try that? 

01:02:30
[sil.] 

01:02:35
MELISSA He blames me. The… The reason he was the way he was was because of the things I did. 

01:02:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… Is there any colonel of truth in there? Okay! Can you tell him that? Is it colonel of truth of truth in there? Tell him how… whatever your understanding is of… of your part that… your part in this and just see how that goes, your imaginary conversation with him? 

01:03:10
[sil.] 

01:03:20
STEVEN ANDREAS How does that go? 

01:03:25
MELISSA Explain him I realize that I… I did some horrible things. 

01:03:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:03:30
MELISSA But that… that’s just not just by the way that I was cheating in the end. 

01:03:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, that’s clear! 

01:03:40
MELISSA That I deserved better than what was given to me. 

01:03:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, sure! And given what we’ve done so far, are you willing to consider representing him in the same way that you represented your mother so you could have those feelings of forgiveness? I think there might be a piece or two missing, but this is how we find out. 

01:04:10
MELISSA I think I could forgive him. 

01:04:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:04:15
MELISSA And then he could be like my mom. 

01:04:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

01:04:20
MELISSA The way I view her. 

01:04:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! With faults, with limitations, like all of us doing the best we can? You’re doing the best you can, aren’t you? You know, still sometimes it stinks. Do you understand the distinction? 

01:04:40
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:04:40
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, there’re people all over the world who’re doing their best they can and sometimes it’s just terrible, but they’re trying hard and some people come into the world with great limitations. And some people become limited by experiences that happen to them. Try it out, because anything we can… we can always shift back. Imagine that you take that image of him and move it over here into the same position as your mother, the same size. And if there’s any special lighting or anything like that to make it… make it the same? 

01:05:20
[sil.] 

01:05:25
STEVEN ANDREAS It’ll be a little weird at first probably. And if you have objections send him back up here again, we’ll deal with objections. 

01:05:35
MELISSA I’m scared. 

01:05:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Scared, good! Of what? Some… Some vulnerability? Can you say a little bit about it? 

01:05:50
MELISSA I’m scared… I’m scared that he would say… 

01:05:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Special things to you that would get you back into it? 

01:05:55
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:06:00
STEVEN ANDREAS What could protect you from that… from that vulnerability? 

01:06:05
MELISSA Remembering how I felt before. 

01:06:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Remembering the good times and the good feelings? Hmm…hmm… Well, there is another possibility and that is that, if you are very clear with him, what is totally out of your world that you simply will not permit that you might try again back together again. But you would need to be very careful. You need to be able to protect yourself from a repetition. 

01:06:35
MELISSA I don’t want it. 

01:06:40
STEVEN ANDREAS You don’t want that? 

01:06:40
MELISSA Hmm… 

01:06:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Then can be… What arrangements could you make inside your own mind so that you’re totally safe with that, that you can see this person, that you had very special times with and treasure those good feelings, those good times, but it’s not enough for you, you deserve better. 

01:07:05
MELISSA What can I do? 

01:07:05
STEVEN ANDREAS I mean, internally. You’ve been in live internal shifts already and they’re very lovely. What could say to yourself or how could you think about him? How could you be very clear it’s more a matter of congruence, of being very congruent in yourself that this fight, the good times you had with this person and that this particular element is personality or behaviour, you… you don’t want that to be a part of this kind of relationship, you deserve better, so that you can be very clear with him and not be vulnerable to falling back in and being mistreated again? 

01:07:50
MELISSA I would just… I know that he’s never gonna change. 

01:08:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, you can’t really know that. You don’t have a fortune teller license, do you? 

01:08:00
MELISSA No, but… 

01:08:05
STEVEN ANDREAS I don’t. 

01:08:05
MELISSA I just… 

01:08:05
STEVEN ANDREAS You don’t… You… At this moment you don’t think he will change? 

01:08:10
MELISSA Right, there is… there is this certain quality. 

01:08:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Great! And you may have very good reason to… to be correct? 

01:08:15
MELISSA I tried for eight months. 

01:08:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! So, knowing that, can you be very clear that if you see this person in… in the future and you’re with him, you can treasure(ph) the good times and know very, very clearly, no… no further? 

01:08:35
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:08:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Maybe that? 

01:08:35
MELISSA Oh yeah! 

01:08:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Take it for a test drive. Close your eyes, imagine being with this person. 

01:08:45
[sil.] 

01:08:55
STEVEN ANDREAS It worked? 

01:08:55
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:09:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now let’s try again. Let’s bring him in again. So you need that protection, for you need do forgiveness, but forgiveness is very, very healing, it can take away all that anger and resentment and hurt and so on. If you can represent him in the way you did your mom and be safe, protect yourself and protect your values. It looks good to me. 

01:09:30
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:09:30
STEVEN ANDREAS You look relaxed, some nice soft smile and then… 

01:09:35
[sil.] 

01:09:40
MELISSA I just… I realized that my mom had her faults. 

01:09:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

01:09:45
MELISSA And that my mom’s always gonna have certain faults. 

01:09:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… They might change. 

01:09:45
MELISSA Right! 

01:09:50
STEVEN ANDREAS There may be different ones. 

01:09:50
MELISSA But I’m gonna… I accept her for who she is. 

01:09:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, exactly! 

01:09:55
MELISSA And that’s what I… I could see myself doing with him. 

01:10:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… And I have faults and you have faults. We’re all human. Time is almost up, do you have any comments you’d like to make or there any questions? 

01:10:15
MELISSA I wanna… I wanna try it out. 

01:10:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Sure! 

01:10:20
MELISSA In reality. 

01:10:20
STEVEN ANDREAS That’s the place to really test drive it, absolutely, try it out. 

01:10:25
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:10:25
STEVEN ANDREAS And can you imagine trying it out in a way where you are safe, such as be with other people or something so you can always grab somebody else by the arm and say, “get me out of here”, okay? 

01:10:35
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:10:35
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s something like that, so you have a sort of a second layer of protection. Now, if you back to the original thing, the… the thing at the… 

01:10:45
MELISSA School? 

01:10:45
STEVEN ANDREAS The school thing? 

01:10:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:10:45
STEVEN ANDREAS What’s it like if you go back and do that, because that’s where we started? 

01:10:55
[sil.] 

01:11:00
MELISSA It’s just calm. 

01:11:00
STEVEN ANDREAS No problem? 

01:11:00
MELISSA It’s just stating okay, is there anyway around this. 

01:11:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

01:11:05
MELISSA No, there is not, you have to do this. Okay, thank you very much, have a nice day. 

01:11:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

01:11:10
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:11:10
STEVEN ANDREAS It looks like… It looks good. I mean, looking at your body and your breathing and everything, it looks… it looks comfortable, right? Now, try want one at… You had tried to… to… You’d imagined two or three other incidents where you’re gotten angry in the past… 

01:11:25
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:11:25
STEVEN ANDREAS …go back to them now. Just… Just run ‘em without any particular intention, just see how they unfold by themselves. 

01:11:35
[sil.] 

01:11:40
MELISSA I can see myself with my father. 

01:11:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

01:11:45
MELISSA Yelling… Him yelling and screaming at me and in the past I would yell and scream back, you know. 

01:11:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Right back, yeah! 

01:11:50
MELISSA But I’ll be… 

01:11:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Which gives him a great excuse to… to yell more at you, right? 

01:11:50
MELISSA Yeah, I know, but I… I could see myself actually saying, okay, you know, alright I understand of, you know, not getting tons, I was calm. 

01:12:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Great, great! 

01:12:10
MELISSA It’s a weird feeling. 

01:12:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that good? Well, it’s unfamiliar, isn’t it? 

01:12:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:12:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now I… I wanna check on one thing. You said you could see yourself being calm, were you just… like looking at yourself on TV or were you actually back in there with your father facing you? 

01:12:25
MELISSA I was back in there with my father face-to-face. 

01:12:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! I thought you were probably doing that the way by your behavior, but I want to check, because sometimes people see it over there, it doesn’t work… 

01:12:35
MELISSA Right! 

01:12:35
STEVEN ANDREAS …in reality, if you get in… 

01:12:35
MELISSA No, I’d actually be standing. 

01:12:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Great! 

01:12:35
MELISSA I could see for instance he’d be standing there and… 

01:12:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Great! 

01:12:40
MELISSA Just calm, cool, relaxed. 

01:12:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Alright! 

01:12:45
MELISSA Thank you! 

01:12:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Thank you! This is delightful. Do you have any other questions? We got about a minute left may be? 

01:12:50
MELISSA No, that’s it. What do I do if it doesn’t work? 

01:12:55
STEVEN ANDREAS You call me up. 

01:12:55
MELISSA I’ll call right up. 

01:13:00
STEVEN ANDREAS I'm serious, yeah. I’ll give you my phone number. 

01:13:00
MELISSA Okay! 

01:13:00
STEVEN ANDREAS I'm serious. Sometimes there’s a little piece missing. This looks really good to me and I don’t know if you’re tracking what we were doing, but repeatedly I would ask for objections and problems and we tried something out well or didn’t quite do it and you tried the one thing out and you were being nicey nice on the outside, but hrr… inside so. 

01:13:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:13:20
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, we kept working it over and kept improving what we were doing, so my guess is we were just fine. But it’s always possible that some part of you is kind of hiding out and kind of thinking, well, I think that’ll work and then when it comes to the situation you go ah…ah… 

01:13:35
MELISSA So I should get that comfort feeling. I should play it over my head before. 

01:13:40
STEVEN ANDREAS You shouldn’t need… You shouldn't need to do anything. 

01:13:40
MELISSA I just go in there and win. 

01:13:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Just go in there and win. 

01:13:45
MELISSA Okay! I can do it. 

01:13:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! I think you can again. Thanks a lot. 

01:13:50
MELISSA Thank you! 

01:13:50
STEVEN ANDREAS I think we’re done. 

01:13:55
[sil.] 

01:14:00
JON CARLSON Let’s look carefully now at some selected clips from this very productive interview. The first one we’re gonna look at is were you really worked with Melissa and get her to loosen up her thinking. 

01:14:10
MELISSA And even though I haven’t taken that class I still should be able to take this class. 

01:14:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

01:14:15
MELISSA No, like well you’ve to go see counsellor. And I’m like, I’m not gonna waste my time. 

01:14:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! But you’re going to waste your time being angry? 

01:14:25
MELISSA Right! It’s a habit. 

01:14:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay, good! Well, see things that are arbitral are wonderful, because if… if something rolls off in a particular sequence, then if we change that, the whole thing will be habitual throughout your life in other ways too. 

01:14:40
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:14:40
JON CARLSON In this piece Steve, just what are you hoping to accomplish? 

01:14:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I’m doing two things here. One is building motivation by showing that she’s complaining about this guy is wasting my time so that’s an excuse to get angry. 

01:14:55
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

01:14:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And I’m saying, “look, you’re willing to waste your time getting angry.” So I’m applying the criteria into her response to make her little more likely to wanna let go with that. And the other is, when she mentions that it’s a habitual response, she’s seeing it as an objection on a problem and I wanna see her… her to see it as a solution, that when we change the response it’ll be just as dependable as the old habit. 

01:15:20
JON CARLSON Okay! 

01:15:20
DIANE KJOS So having the habit of getting angry when you change that to the habit of not getting angry? 

01:15:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

01:15:25
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:15:25
STEVEN ANDREAS So it’s great that it’s habitual. 

01:15:25
DIANE KJOS Ah okay! 

01:15:25
JON CARLSON Let’s move on to the next clip. In the next clip you really help her to focus more on how she would eventually like to respond. 

01:15:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:15:40
MELISSA And it was like, no you have to go see the counsellor and I’m like… 

01:15:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And you know bureaucracies are like that, don’t you? 

01:15:45
MELISSA Yeah, but I can’t stand that. 

01:15:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, seeing the choice though given that bureaucracies are like that and you’re probably gonna find this… this is gonna happen again and this happened before, you mentioned that this happens a lot of times, right? 

01:16:00
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:16:00
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s like the inherent stupidity of the world suddenly puts itself in your face? 

01:16:05
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:16:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Right? 

01:16:05
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:16:05
STEVEN ANDREAS So the question is, how would you like to respond to this? 

01:16:10
MELISSA I don’t wanna blow up by people. 

01:16:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! So? 

01:16:15
MELISSA I don’t like to do it. 

01:16:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, if I got on a bus here and I said, I don’t wanna go to Milwaukee and I don’t wanna go to New Orleans and I don’t wanna go to San Francisco, how would the bus driver know where to take me? 

01:16:25
MELISSA Unless you tell him? 

01:16:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! So, where would you like to go? What would you like to do different? 

01:16:30
JON CARLSON In that piece, you really try to get her not to look so much at what the problem was or what she didn’t wanna do, but it looks like you’re trying to get her to look at what the future would look like if she’s done it right. 

01:16:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, this is a key piece of NLP. Most people are problem-oriented and they… they know what they don’t want, they know what the problem is, but they don’t know really what they do want and that’s really like the bus driver. If you don’t know what you do want, you can’t really get there. And so I’m asking her to focus on a positive outcome which is a key part of NLP. 

01:17:05
JON CARLSON So she’s really having to change the way she thinks? 

01:17:05
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s turning things around. This is a piece of Virginia Satir, who did a great deal. People… She would say, you know, “okay, that’s what you don’t want, what do you want?” 

01:17:15
DIANE KJOS “What do you want?” 

01:17:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

01:17:15
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:17:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:17:15
JON CARLSON In this next clip, you really even take it further in getting her to switch positions. Let’s watch that. 

01:17:25
MELISSA Instead of saying, “I can’t believe you!” 

01:17:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, an outrage. 

01:17:25
MELISSA Yeah! I mean, because it wasn’t the person’s fault. I mean… 

01:17:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, it’s not their’s, they’re just part of the system. 

01:17:30
MELISSA Right! 

01:17:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! So, they’re in fact, you’re… you’re acting like your ind… you’re being targeted, right? And here is this poor guy and you’re targeting him. 

01:17:40
MELISSA I know. 

01:17:40
STEVEN ANDREAS He’s just part of the system. 

01:17:45
MELISSA I know. 

01:17:45
STEVEN ANDREAS I can’t believe you’d be that kind of person? 

01:17:50
MELISSA I am. 

01:17:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:17:50
JON CARLSON This was really an eye-opener for her that she was seemed to be doing the very thing that she was having done to her or was… 

01:18:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! Well, again it’s utilizing her criteria to motivate her to change, to show her that in fact this thing that she’s complaining about so heavily in the world is actually what she is doing when she gets angry. 

01:18:10
JON CARLSON Is that a pretty countered(ph) phenomenon that people really… 

01:18:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Do what they complain about? 

01:18:15
JON CARLSON Right, yeah! 

01:18:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh yeah, sure! 

01:18:20
JON CARLSON Yeah, they do on to others that not what they want done on to them? 

01:18:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

01:18:20
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:18:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, it’s a common thing. 

01:18:25
DIANE KJOS One of the things that fascinated here is your… you know, you really early into the interview and you’ve got a real good give and take going with her. You’ve established a… a nice working relationship where you can point out her faults and she’ll say, “yeah, that’s exactly what I did.” 

01:18:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I’m being playful with her and I’m not looking down on her. 

01:18:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:18:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Criticizing her and saying, “hey, look what you’re doing here!” And that kind of attitude of just being a friend and being kind of along for the ride goes a long way I think. You know, there are later parts of the tape where she gets very serious and I’m very serious, but this point… Humors is a great thing. Humor solves a lot of problems. 

01:19:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:19:00
JON CARLSON Yeah! In this next piece we’re gonna watch you talking about objections, okay. And can you talk about that a little bit. 

01:19:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Before you watch the clip? 

01:19:10
JON CARLSON Yeah! Ah…Ah… 

01:19:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Well… 

01:19:10
JON CARLSON I need to set that up. 

01:19:10
STEVEN ANDREAS There are two… two basic processes as I see it in therapy. One is making the change, whatever the change is, to changing a habit or changing a response from a feeling response and so on. And the other is, making sure that that change really fits with all parts of the person. And that… We need to know all the objections, because if there’re any objections, they only look sabotaging, they’ll end up being what people often call resistance. And we look at objections as simply that there’re some part of the person that has a concern that needs to be validated, needs to be addressed and dealt with it in some way before you actually make the change. 

01:19:50
JON CARLSON What happens once you get rid of these objections that the person has? 

01:19:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s not much that we get rid of them, it’s that we find a way so that the objection is satisfied within the change. 

01:20:00
JON CARLSON Okay! 

01:20:00
STEVEN ANDREAS The change is structured in such a way that any objections are satisfied and then change is easy. 

01:20:10
JON CARLSON And then the behavior is congruent? 

01:20:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Yes! 

01:20:10
JON CARLSON To the… With the person? 

01:20:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Right, all parts of the person. 

01:20:15
JON CARLSON Then it’s like more than likely to be permanent? 

01:20:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, unless something else gets on the way and then you’ve be over that. Nothing is… Luckily nothing is permanent, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to do this kind of change work. 

01:20:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. 

01:20:25
JON CARLSON Okay, let’s watch this next clip. 

01:20:30
STEVEN ANDREAS And go back to… so you imagine… re-roll the same movie again, only this time, when you hand over the papers or whatever it was and he tells you, you can’t register and so on, just… you don’t have to tell me anything about it, just tell me how it goes as you imagine doing that. Being calm and just saying, “okay, who do I need to talk to you about this?” Or whatever… whatever is satisfying for you. 

01:21:00
MELISSA Okay! 

01:21:00
STEVEN ANDREAS That’s alright? 

01:21:05
MELISSA I say, “okay, thank you” and then, you know, I walk away. 

01:21:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:21:10
MELISSA I could… I could… I could see that. 

01:21:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:21:15
MELISSA But I don’t think I could ever do that. 

01:21:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, let’s do another piece of that, but that would be satisfying for you, right? 

01:21:20
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:21:20
STEVEN ANDREAS If you could do that you’d be happy, is that right? 

01:21:25
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:21:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, let’s double-check. Close your eyes and ask inside, is there any part of me that would have any objection to dealing with this kind of situation in this way? And just be sensitive to any feeling or any voice or any picture that might come up or any part of you might object, have any objection to this? 

01:21:45
[sil.] 

01:21:50
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:21:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:21:50
MELISSA There is a part. 

01:21:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… What’s the objection? 

01:22:00
MELISSA That… It’s… It’s their fault and since they are the one to blame. 

01:22:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh you wanna blame somebody? 

01:22:05
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:22:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh! 

01:22:05
JON CARLSON In this section Steve, you seemed to use logic. Is that a big part of NLP work? 

01:22:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s using the client’s own logic. 

01:22:15
JON CARLSON Ah…Ah… 

01:22:15
STEVEN ANDREAS And it may not be logical in the sense that a teacher of symbolic logic might think about it, but it’s their criteria, their way of thinking. And if you can use their way of thinking to support the outcome that they’re going for then they’ll be totally happy with it. 

01:22:25
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

01:22:30
DIANE KJOS So somebody is to blame and…? 

01:22:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Right now she needs to blame somebody. 

01:22:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:22:35
STEVEN ANDREAS And that needs to be honored. 

01:22:35
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:22:35
STEVEN ANDREAS And blame isn’t useful ultimately. At… At the end of the tape she’s not blaming, but at this point I need to honor that objection as it’s presented to me and then find a way that that objection could be satisfied by going through and proceeding with reaching forgiveness. 

01:22:50
JON CARLSON And in this whole process she seems to be more empowered? 

01:22:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Sure! 

01:23:00
JON CARLSON You know, she’s able to take more responsibility for her own life. 

01:23:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

01:23:05
JON CARLSON And you do that so suddenly, no may be it isn’t so… 

01:23:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s basically teaching… You know, I think this is teaching rather than therapy. It’s kind of teaching people how to use their brains and people’s brain tend to run off with them and take them places they don’t wanna go. And here this is the first step in… in rehearsing a possible solution, possible positive outcome for… that… that she would prefer better than getting angry. And we’re only on the first step of it and she has an objection and we’ll keep doing this over and over again. 

01:23:35
JON CARLSON Well, this next clip we’re gonna… we’re gonna watch, you do some important teaching to her… for her. Let’s watch it. 

01:23:45
STEVEN ANDREAS So we really need to get all the objections and satisfy them all. So what’s this one? 

01:23:50
MELISSA The other situation? 

01:23:50
STEVEN ANDREAS The other objection. No, you don’t have to tell me the situation. In fact, that’s another thing I should have mentioned about this is, usually we can work more and more… mostly without content. 

01:24:00
MELISSA Okay! 

01:24:00
STEVEN ANDREAS So we don’t need details and names and places and dates and stuff like that. 

01:24:05
MELISSA Okay! Umm… 

01:24:05
STEVEN ANDREAS So you tried it in another situation and there are some rejections there? 

01:24:10
MELISSA No, there’s no objection. I could clearly see how I’d have gotten a benefit… 

01:24:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Gotten more? 

01:24:15
MELISSA Yeah, I got more out of it if I were… 

01:24:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh good! Well, I misinterpreted your expression. 

01:24:20
MELISSA If I were calm down. 

01:24:20
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, this kind of… You’ve this kind of dry look on your face and I thought, oh, another objection. 

01:24:25
JON CARLSON What do you mean in this piece here that we don’t need content, that you can work without content, facts, dates? That’s something really important in most therapies. 

01:24:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, all I need to know here is that somebody mistreated her, that somebody violated her values. I don’t really need to know the details. I don’t need to know who. I don’t need… 

01:24:45
JON CARLSON How or when? 

01:24:45
STEVEN ANDREAS …to know the gory details or when it happened and how it happened and all the horrible things that were said. That’s pretty irrelevant really. 

01:24:50
DIANE KJOS Does it… Does that help her somewhat to… to say what if works for this and what work for that and work for that or? 

01:25:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, I’m letting her do that. 

01:25:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:25:00
STEVEN ANDREAS I’m… I’m having her select other examples of situations like this and you know in a hundred years she couldn’t tell me enough about it for me to really understand her experience. 

01:25:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:25:10
STEVEN ANDREAS For by her rehearsing it in her mind, she can have a full experience of what is it like to be with this specific person and hearing what that person had said to her and all the rest of it. She needs the content, I don’t need the content. As long as I know enough about the kind of thing that she’s dealing with. 

01:25:25
JON CARLSON Oh I see! In this next clip, we’re gonna watch you have her go into a future situation. 

01:25:40
STEVEN ANDREAS You’ve a future situation in which this might happen? Can you can imagine a future possibility may be with somebody who’s bugged you in the past or something like that? 

01:25:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:25:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Run through a future possibility. Close your eyes. Just imagine somebody blocks you in other way and so stuff like that or whatever. This is a road test. 

01:26:00
MELISSA I’m angry. 

01:26:05
STEVEN ANDREAS You’re angry? 

01:26:05
MELISSA I’m angry. 

01:26:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And what does the angry part want for you? 

01:26:10
MELISSA It wants me to hurt that person like they hurt me. 

01:26:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… Okay! So there’s hurt underneath this? 

01:26:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:26:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that blocking you? What’s… What's the route to that? Just come from a long time ago, being hurt in this way? 

01:26:30
MELISSA About a month. 

01:26:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm? 

01:26:35
MELISSA About a month ago. 

01:26:35
STEVEN ANDREAS A month ago! So is there a particular person who hurt you in this way? 

01:26:40
MELISSA My ex. 

01:26:40
JON CARLSON In this piece you talk to her… you talk with her about a road test. What does a road test mean? 

01:26:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, the technical term is future pace. It’s a rehearsal into the future to try out a new set of behaviors to find out how well they work. In her mind, with her best information about the situation that she has dealt with in the past by getting angry, let’s try out the new being calm and so on. 

01:27:00
JON CARLSON And what did you see in this particular interview? 

01:27:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, in this particular piece she… she gets angry again, so it doesn’t work yet. There’s something else we need to do so I ask, you know, what’s the function of the anger? What does the anger want for you? What is its positive outcome? We look at any part of a person that resists or gets in the way of a possible solution as another resource, this is a part that has another concern. There’s something else that needs to happen to further develop the… the behavioral response that we wanna put in there to make it really work and so any more information about this. What is the anger about? And oh, there’s hurt there, okay. And something about the way she… seeing her face changed. 

01:27:45
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:27:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And she got more emotional there suggested to me that there was this much more than just the registrar and the hassle with the classes. This had some other routes and there are some other things in here. 

01:27:55
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:27:55
STEVEN ANDREAS So I asked is there some other route, you know, to this. 

01:27:55
JON CARLSON And she seemed to know what you’re talking about. Yeah! 

01:28:00
STEVEN ANDREAS It came right out. 

01:28:00
JON CARLSON It came out right away. 

01:28:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! It wouldn't necessarily but for her it did very easily. 

01:28:05
JON CARLSON In this next piece, you’re gonna talk to her about forgiveness and she seemed to have some misunderstandings about the… what forgiveness was and who it was for? 

01:28:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, a lot of people have misunderstandings about forgiveness. Some people thing they should do it for other people. 

01:28:20
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:28:25
STEVEN ANDREAS And you know there are lot of spiritual teachings about forgiveness and there is a lot of misconceptions about forgiveness, so this is again part of the educational processes. How could this be useful to you in reaching the outcome that she wants, which is to be calm and not to blow up in these situations? 

01:28:40
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:28:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! 

01:28:40
JON CARLSON Well, let’s watch this clarification and especially her response to your words. 

01:28:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Let’s do a different thing in that? Would you be interested in reaching forgiveness with this person? 

01:28:50
MELISSA I didn’t do anything wrong. 

01:28:55
STEVEN ANDREAS No! I know. I… I believe you. And forgiveness isn’t for the other person, it’s for you so that you wouldn’t have to be… have the feelings of hurt or anger or resentment or revenge. 

01:29:10
MELISSA Right! 

01:29:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Is that anything would be of interest in you? 

01:29:15
MELISSA I wanna let it go. 

01:29:15
STEVEN ANDREAS You’d like to let it go? 

01:29:15
MELISSA It’s bugging me everyday. 

01:29:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Yeah, that’s the problem with it and that’s… that's why forgiveness is particularly useful in situations like this. 

01:29:25
JON CARLSON You also look like when I watch this that you were proposing an outcome for her having her to rethink this. 

01:29:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Right, yeah! There’s nothing wrong in proposing an outcome as long as I do it gently and just offering it as a possibility. 

01:29:45
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

01:29:45
STEVEN ANDREAS For the most part we ask for the person’s outcome, but here it’s clear she’s angry, she’s resentful against somebody. I know what the solution is, the solution is forgiveness. 

01:29:55
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:29:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And it’s question of offering it to her in such a way that she can maybe find it appealing or at least there’s something to consider. 

01:30:00
DIANE KJOS And she picked up very quickly that, I want to let it go kind of piece that… 

01:30:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

01:30:05
DIANE KJOS …said this is how I’m gonna have to do it. 

01:30:05
STEVEN ANDREAS And that's actually the… the middle English root of forgive… forgiven or forgiveness is to let go. 

01:30:15
DIANE KJOS Ah! 

01:30:15
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s the actual root of the word so. 

01:30:15
JON CARLSON In this next piece you do some very interesting work with forgiveness in which you have her look at where she feels about her boyfriend and then where she feels about her mom, someone whom she had some resolution and forgiveness with. Let’s watch it as you talk about these different positions. 

01:30:40
STEVEN ANDREAS When you think of this person, where is the image located? How far away and so on? Tell me more about this image? I… I don’t mean content, I mean like how far away is it, is it… is it big or small? 

01:30:55
MELISSA It’s far right there. 

01:30:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Right there, that’s why you’re looking about here? 

01:31:00
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:31:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! So about this far away? 

01:31:00
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:31:00
STEVEN ANDREAS And how tall? How big? Life size, small? 

01:31:05
MELISSA Life size. 

01:31:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Life size! So it’s like he’s standing right here? Okay, and is there any voices to it? 

01:31:10
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:31:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Good! And I don’t want an… I don’t need the content, but is it like straightened(ph), angry, calm, peaceful, what kind of? 

01:31:20
MELISSA Yelling and screaming. 

01:31:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yelling and screaming, all good stuff like that, okay! Now, can you think of someone who harmed you in past but you’ve forgiven them? 

01:31:30
MELISSA Hmm…hmm… 

01:31:30
STEVEN ANDREAS How do you represent that person? 

01:31:35
[sil.] 

01:31:40
MELISSA My mom. 

01:31:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And… And where is… And you think of your mom, whom you’ve forgiven, where is she? Is she in the same location or something different in your personal space? 

01:31:55
MELISSA She’s closer. 

01:31:55
STEVEN ANDREAS She’s closer? Okay! Where? 

01:32:00
[sil.] 

01:32:05
MELISSA I don't know. I’d say, may be right next to me. 

01:32:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Right here? 

01:32:10
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:32:10
STEVEN ANDREAS And close to you? This… And I hear your voice change, so there’s a little softness there, right? 

01:32:15
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:32:15
STEVEN ANDREAS So I believe you, you have forgiven her. Some people, they've sort of forgiven but not, but I hear in your voice that you really have forgiven her. There is a softness and a warmth there. Okay, great! Now, here is the… here is the hard part, this is the easy part. 

01:32:35
MELISSA Great! 

01:32:35
STEVEN ANDREAS And we lead into the hard part and with lots of warning. If you wanna forgive this person here, one way to do it is to represent him over here close and so on in the same way that you represent your mom. Now, I don’t think you’re unwilling to do that right now, most people are, right? 

01:32:55
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:32:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, what are your objections? 

01:32:55
JON CARLSON What is this significance of the different locations of the mom and the boyfriend? I mean, is this really that important? 

01:33:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, it’s vitally important and people have been doing various kinds of visualization for years without realizing the importance of where you visualize things. That’s a very simple example. If you say, I could go to New York, notice where you picture is and then if you say, I will go to New York, the picture shifts. It becomes in a different location. So things that you will do and actually will happen literally occupy different position in your mind than something that you could do, which is a simply a possibility, but not… we are not committed to it. And when a person resents somebody, they’ll be literally located into different space than someone that they have forgiven. And it uses in many, many modifications, many, many applications of this, so we find a counter example to the person who’s they… they’re resentful at one person, well, forgiveness is the counter example. Here is someone who did something bad to you but you’ve forgiven them, where they are located? And that tells you actually the perceptual shift that the person needs to make in their mind. That’s the easy part, actually. 

01:34:10
JON CARLSON Right! 

01:34:10
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, if I had her shift though now, she would be very unhappy with it. She would be in some kind of danger from forgiving this guy. 

01:34:15
JON CARLSON Okay! 

01:34:15
STEVEN ANDREAS So I need to deal that’s why I leave right into what’s the objection. 

01:34:20
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:34:20
JON CARLSON But this is really powerful, because you’ve already let her know that she has been successful before, that she’s had a solution to a similar problem. 

01:34:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, absolutely! 

01:34:30
DIANE KJOS The… The other thing that I noticed about when you set this up was you asked about how it sounded that his… 

01:34:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

01:34:35
DIANE KJOS …his voice or the sound. 

01:34:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

01:34:40
DIANE KJOS And she… 

01:34:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, for us a representation is a full… it’s image, the visuals, the auditory and the kinaesthetic. The image includes all of that and so I wanna amplify that and… and bring that all out too. If I had asked about the sound with her mother, I’m sure it would have been much more calm and peaceful. 

01:34:55
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

01:34:55
STEVEN ANDREAS I know that from her response. 

01:35:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:35:00
STEVEN ANDREAS So I didn't. I could have done that too though. 

01:35:00
JON CARLSON Well, this next piece we’re gonna watch you bring out something else, you bring out some emotions. Let’s watch what happens in the interview and these emotions come forth from Melissa. And I’d like to hear after the clip why you responded in the way you did? 

01:35:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, what are your objections? Where do the objections get in? 

01:35:25
MELISSA I hate him. 

01:35:30
STEVEN ANDREAS For what he did? 

01:35:30
MELISSA I hate him for lying. 

01:35:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:35:35
MELISSA I hate for the way I was treated. 

01:35:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:35:40
MELISSA And… Yeah, that’s about it. 

01:35:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, this may be, take a little while to get this understanding across, but the first thing I wanna mention is, I assume you had some warm feelings for this person as well, okay! 

01:35:55
JON CARLSON Steve you just seem to almost ignore this very emotional moment for her. What was going on inside you and why did you choose your response? 

01:36:10
STEVEN ANDREAS This is probably the hardest question I’m gonna have to answer today. And it’s hard to answer it because it takes a whole different mindset to understand the answer. 

01:36:20
JON CARLSON Okay! 

01:36:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Feelings are responses to her memories in this case. It’s not real life, because her ex-boyfriend is not in the room. So it’s in her mind. She makes a certain set of pictures. She makes a certain set of sounds or she hears him speaking or whatever. She remembers the horrible things he did and then she has these really unpleasant feelings. Now, if were to dwell on those feelings that would be essentially problem-oriented. She has went into the situation, it didn’t work, she’s feeling bad. But I’m interested always in the solutions. I need to respect her feelings. She’s… Right now, she’s feeling bad. She’s remembering those hard times, but what my job is to find out a solution for her so that she doesn’t have to have those feelings and that’s why I don't dwell on them. 

01:37:10
JON CARLSON It’s so much of… of psychotherapy is get those feelings out. Aren’t you afraid that if you don’t tend to them they are gonna stay there and fester in her? 

01:37:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, see that… that presupposes that feelings are like pus and a boil or something. I use the word fester and these kind of metaphors are… Metaphors are wonderfully useful and they also can be misleading. And a lot of psychotherapy is based on Freud’s planning(ph) metaphor. They are fluids in the body. And by the way he got this from (inaudible ) brain worked on little pumps and pumping fluids around. 

01:37:45
JON CARLSON What metaphors do you have? 

01:37:45
STEVEN ANDREAS And it’s a good… It’s a good first approximation, but applying metaphors if you push something down here it pops up something else and… 

01:37:50
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:37:50
STEVEN ANDREAS …the (crosstalk)(inaudible)… 

01:37:55
DIANE KJOS You gotto drain it off. 

01:37:55
STEVEN ANDREAS They had to drain the primal pool of pain. 

01:37:55
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:37:55
STEVEN ANDREAS There’s nice alliteration liberation there, but it didn’t really work. And we think of it more as a computer metaphor or CD metaphor that if you don’t play the CD there is no music. There is not like there is music in a CD bursting and trying to get out or festering to get out. Instead if you don’t put the laser light on the CD, if you don’t play the memory it doesn’t happen. 

01:38:15
JON CARLSON This is kind of like a jute box theory or something? 

01:38:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, I often called at the jute box. Lot of people don’t know what a jute box is any more so. 

01:38:25
JON CARLSON Oh no, we’ve dictionaries, you know, people can look that one up. 

01:38:30
DIANE KJOS Look that one up. 

01:38:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:38:30
DIANE KJOS But… But don’t… don't… don't you think she might feel that you didn’t really care about her, because you just let her cry and ignored it, you know. 

01:38:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, she’s having these feelings and you see what I’m doing is I’m… I'm… I'm supporting her values, which is a crucial thing. Her values were… were violated and then she had the bad feelings. So rather than support the bad feelings, I wanna go back to the values that were violated and say, “look, we wanna find a way so that you can be safe, so that your values aren’t violated, so you’re not subjected to lying or deseed or whatever it was that was going on. 

01:39:05
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:39:05
STEVEN ANDREAS And in that way I think I’m fully supporting her, but in a positive way through access her positive values, what she wants to have happen rather than what she doesn’t wanna have happen. And this is one of the great parallels between this whole solution-oriented field in general in NLP. 

01:39:25
JON CARLSON Well, let’s… let's watch the next piece too which is similar and that you are continuing to build this positive outcome. 

01:39:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Now, this one other piece that I’m sure would be very important here, before you would be willing to forgive him. You would need to be protected, because if you forgave him, you might be tempted to go back with him on the same basis that you were before and then you would be vulnerable to the same kind of treatment again. Does that make sense to you? So you would need to feel assured in yourself that if you forgave him, you would need to have some kind of resolution about, you know, “I’m sorry this happened and I’m sorry he had to be who he was and so on, but that’s not what I want in my life.” Or something like that so that you’d be safe, because sometimes you know this happens all the time in battered women and stuff, they forgive their husbands, they go right back in, they get beat up again, you don’t want that, right? You know, do you have a sense, if you close your eyes and imagine going into the future and imagine that you felt the same toward him as you do towards your mother. Do you feel safe? Is there any danger? 

01:40:50
MELISSA There is that danger that I would go back. 

01:40:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! And what could you… What could we do here that would make that no longer a danger? That you might recog… For instance I’m just gonna talk on a little violent and you do whatever you want to. That if you tell in your mind clearly, here is a person who had many qualities that I liked, we had many good times together, but lying is just, it’s a no-no, I don’t like that, I don’t want that to be a… to be a part of my life, unless I was totally assured that… that absolutely would not happen in the future. I just don’t wanna have… I just… I could talk to this person and I can say, hello, well I just don’t wanna be in a relationship with this person. Is there any kind of arrangements like that that you could make inside yourself so that if you go into the future and you think about being with this person without hate and without anger, would it still be safe from any kind of future repetitions of that? 

01:42:00
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:42:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Close your eyes, go into the future and imagine that you’ve done that. And you meet him on camp or sort of wherever you’d be likely to meet him. And just road test what we’ve done here. 

01:42:20
[sil.] 

01:42:25
STEVEN ANDREAS What is it like being with him? Is it easy for you to maintain whatever distance is important to you or whatever protection? 

01:42:35
MELISSA Yeah! I can… I can do it. 

01:42:35
STEVEN ANDREAS “But”, I heard a “but” in your voice? 

01:42:45
MELISSA But it’s like I put on this… this fun, you know, of being happy and… 

01:42:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Now, that… that I don’t recommend this. 

01:42:55
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:42:55
JON CARLSON Here we see some more road testing. Can you talk a little bit about what you were doing in this piece? 

01:43:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, we’re continuing to refine the outcome. I mean, the general outcome is, it starts out being not angry and then it becomes to be calm and to be functional and so on. And we’re… we’re gradually working up to it piece by piece. Earlier she didn’t wanted have anything to do with this guy and now, at this point, she’s willing to… she can… in her mind she can have a talk with him, but she puts on this nicey nice and… and that’s gonna take too much effort, that’s gonna be hard for her, it’s gonna be a conflict, she’s incongruent about it. 

01:43:30
JON CARLSON Yeah, the danger! 

01:43:30
STEVEN ANDREAS So we just keep testing her outcome and… and imagination and when we finally get it right, it’ll work in the real world, if there are no further objections that we haven’t met. 

01:43:40
JON CARLSON The buts? 

01:43:40
STEVEN ANDREAS The buts, yeah! 

01:43:40
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:43:40
STEVEN ANDREAS I mean, this isn’t… this is partly there, we just keep refining and keep moving. 

01:43:45
DIANE KJOS Getting closer? 

01:43:50
STEVEN ANDREAS You know, it’s a little like going to the moon, you know, they shoot off the rocket and then they find out how much there are off course and then they change it and they find out they’re off course the other way and then it keep changing back and forth and gradually you get that. 

01:44:00
DIANE KJOS But really in that segment you did something that… that was kind of incongruent I guess to be in that was where you said, I’m gonna talk on for a while, you can do it you want to. In other words, so listen to me and… 

01:44:10
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s called permissiveness. 

01:44:10
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:44:10
STEVEN ANDREAS That was… I probably wouldn’t say that again if I… if I could re-edit the word that I probably would leave that out. 

01:44:15
DIANE KJOS Oh okay! 

01:44:15
STEVEN ANDREAS  Yeah! I probably just… I’d like to talk for a little while, you just listen or something like that. 

01:44:20
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:44:25
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… Well, in this next segment you’re gonna do some more rocket corrections, I guess, if we wanna use your previous analogy. 

01:44:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:44:30
JON CARLSON  And there’s gonna be more rehearsal that Melissa is gonna have of being with her ex. 

01:44:40
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… My guess is you’d like to protect somebody else from this, wouldn’t you? 

01:44:45
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:44:45
STEVEN ANDREAS In the future if he’s with somebody else, would you want them to go through the same thing you went through? 

01:44:50
MELISSA Uh…huh… 

01:44:55
STEVEN ANDREAS So, you’d like to have an impact on him, right, even if you never see him again? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could say, “hey, that didn’t work for me, that hurt like hell”, or whatever your words would be and make him understand that what he did, didn’t fit for you? 

01:45:15
[sil.] 

01:45:20
MELISSA I think I can do it. 

01:45:25
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! Imagine in your mind. Close your eyes. Imagine doing that with him and notice how he responds. Notice where the conversation goes that you be clear that your central focus is on letting him know your experience, because if you start blaming him, he’ll probably just get uptight and turn away or disappear. But if you’re just there telling him how do you feel, there is a chance that he listens, I can’t guarantee you. 

01:46:00
[sil.] 

01:46:10
STEVEN ANDREAS How was that going, did you try that? 

01:46:15
[sil.] 

01:46:20
MELISSA He blames me. The… The reason he was the way he was was because of the things I did. 

01:46:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… Is there any colonel of truth in there? Okay! Can you tell him that? Is it colonel of truth of truth in there? Tell him how… whatever your understanding is of… of your part that… your part in this and just see how that goes, your imaginary conversation with him? 

01:46:55
[sil.] 

01:47:05
STEVEN ANDREAS How does that go? 

01:47:10
MELISSA Explain him I realize that I… I did some horrible things. 

01:47:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Okay! 

01:47:15
MELISSA But that… that’s just not just by the way that I was cheating in the end. 

01:47:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, that’s clear! 

01:47:25
JON CARLSON Seems like there’s really a major shift here on her part in perception and subsequent responsibility? 

01:47:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, she started out blaming him, it’s all his fault, and she did nothing wrong. 

01:47:35
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:47:35
STEVEN ANDREAS In fact, earlier she says, I did nothing wrong and I pasted(ph) that, I just said, right, I’m sure I agree with you or something like that. I don’t really believe it’s true at that point, but I wanna maintain rapport with her. At that point it would be ridiculous for me to challenge that at that point. But this point, you know, she says, well, he says, I did a lot of things. And I said, well, this are even a colonel of truth. 

01:47:55
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:47:55
JON CARLSON Right! 

01:47:55
STEVEN ANDREAS And she takes that and amplifies. She says, I did a lot of horrible things. Now, that’s a general way, I just lead into it and see where she goes with it. And then she comes… she’s coming to balance. She’s coming to realize more than notion of not fitting that use and that’s straight out of Satir. 

01:48:15
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

01:48:15
STEVEN ANDREAS Most people… If… If there’s problem between people in a relationship, you’re wrong, they don't say, no you are wrong. And its all blaming and it’s all you should change rather than me. She is coming to balance here. 

01:48:25
JON CARLSON And you did that. You… You really suggested a shift from those blaming you messages to those more responsible? 

01:48:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

01:48:35
JON CARLSON I messages… 

01:48:35
DIANE KJOS I messages! 

01:48:35
JON CARLSON …which was really gets into the communication training. 

01:48:40
STEVEN ANDREAS It’s more… Yeah, basically it is. Now, it’s parts of the person, because she’s communicating with part of her brain that represents her ex-husband… ex-boyfriend or whatever. And it’s communication training like intracerebrally. 

01:48:50
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:48:50
JON CARLSON Yeah, sure! 

01:48:55
DIANE KJOS And there is a great deal of emotion going on with her if you weren’t watch her face and… and her eyes. 

01:49:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah, she’s great feeling person. 

01:49:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:49:00
JON CARLSON And (inaudible ). 

01:49:02
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! And… And that seems to be part of how she’s changing her thinking, the… the emotional component of it. 

01:49:10
STEVEN ANDREAS I would say the emotional comes after that perceptual. 

01:49:15
DIANE KJOS Oh okay, okay! 

01:49:15
STEVEN ANDREAS That… Which… When I suggest different ways of communicating or saying, you know, I messages versus you messages. 

01:49:20
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:49:20
STEVEN ANDREAS That that will change her ex’s response in her mind to something a little more productive, that allows her to be a little more reasonable and the result of that is the feeling change. 

01:49:30
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:49:30
STEVEN ANDREAS I would… I would say. Oh who knows? 

01:49:35
DIANE KJOS It’s sequence, yeah, yeah! 

01:49:35
JON CARLSON In this next clip we’re gonna see my favorite part of this video and that’s where you actually ask her to change the representation… 

01:49:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:49:45
JON CARLSON …from where her boyfriend was to where her mother is. 

01:49:50
STEVEN ANDREAS Alright! And this is something we do only after we’ve dealt with all these objections and she’s satisfied, oh yeah, this would be a good thing, I’ll be safe, I’ll be protected. I… I don’t need anger to get my point across. I don’t need anger to get people’s attention and all of rest of it. 

01:50:05
JON CARLSON Right! 

01:50:05
STEVEN ANDREAS But this is actually… This is the crucial piece, the rest is just making the path so that that will work. 

01:50:15
JON CARLSON I guess if works it’s the therapist dessert, it’s the part that you’ve earned the last. This is all put together. Let's watch. 

01:50:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Well it’s always nice to see people get happy. Try it out, because anything we can… we can always shift back. Imagine that you take that image of him and move it over here into the same position as your mother, the same size. And if there’s any special lighting or anything like that to make it… make it the same? 

01:50:45
[sil.] 

01:50:55
STEVEN ANDREAS It’ll be a little weird at first probably. And if you have objections send him back up here again, we’ll deal with objections. 

01:51:00
MELISSA I’m scared. 

01:51:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Scared, good! Of what? Some… Some vulnerability? Can you say a little bit about it? 

01:51:15
MELISSA I’m scared… I’m scared that he would say… 

01:51:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Special things to you that would get you back into it? 

01:51:20
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:51:25
JON CARLSON What was going on when she’s with you and she said, she was still scared? 

01:51:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Well, it’s not really going on with me, but often you… you lay all the groundwork, you think you have dealt with all the objections. 

01:51:35
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:51:35
STEVEN ANDREAS And then when you actually make the change, phew… up comes another objection. 

01:51:40
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:51:40
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:51:40
STEVEN ANDREAS It wasn’t deal with and this is… this is why we do all this road testing. 

01:51:45
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

01:51:45
STEVEN ANDREAS We do all the testing. And by the way this is a page straight out of Virginia Satir. 

01:51:45
JON CARLSON Hmm…hmm… 

01:51:45
STEVEN ANDREAS We watch her films she’s continually suggesting ways to communicate within the family and saying, now, try this out and what does he say back and they’ll switch potions. And she’s doing all the stuff. It’s basically the same thing, only here I’m just doing it in her mind. 

01:52:00
JON CARLSON So you didn’t feel a sense of failure like I haven’t done my job? 

01:52:05
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh, no! It’s just part of my job to deal with the objections. And see I respect objections. I believe that at this point if I had forced her to change that position and she went out in the world, when next time she encountered this guy, she’d be scared and she’d feel vulnerable and probably would be vulnerable. I don’t wanna do that. I wanna send her out into the world bullet-proof. 

01:52:25
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:52:25
STEVEN ANDREAS I wanna send her out there… So when she sees her ex, she feels good and solid and she can talk to him and she can use eye language and she can… if he yells at her she can just let it just wash off like the water off, that’s back. I wanna her to be bullet-proof. 

01:52:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:52:40
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:52:40
STEVEN ANDREAS And so I… when an objection comes up it’s like, oh good, here’s another one. 

01:52:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah, let’s clean that one out. 

01:52:45
STEVEN ANDREAS Because that’s part of the solution. 

01:52:45
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:52:50
JON CARLSON Well, go and do and her final clip is we’re going to watch the closing segment, we’ll get an idea in this piece just how bullet-proof she really is. 

01:53:00
[sil.] 

01:53:05
STEVEN ANDREAS …layer of protection. Now, if you back to the original thing, the… the thing at the… 

01:53:10
MELISSA School? 

01:53:10
STEVEN ANDREAS The school thing? 

01:53:10
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:53:10
STEVEN ANDREAS What’s it like if you go back and do that, because that’s where we started? 

01:53:20
[sil.] 

01:53:25
MELISSA It’s just calm. 

01:53:25
STEVEN ANDREAS No problem? 

01:53:25
MELISSA It’s just stating okay, is there anyway around this. 

01:53:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Hmm…hmm… 

01:53:30
MELISSA No, there is not, you have to do this. Okay, thank you very much, have a nice day. 

01:53:35
STEVEN ANDREAS Right! 

01:53:35
MELISSA Yeah! 

01:53:35
STEVEN ANDREAS It looks like… It looks good. I mean, looking at your body and your breathing and everything, it looks… it looks comfortable, right? 

01:53:45
JON CARLSON Wow, what a dramatic change! If we took that first piece… 

01:53:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:53:45
JON CARLSON …when she came in it was so railed and here at the end it’s! 

01:53:50
DIANE KJOS And it’s sigh of relief. 

01:53:50
JON CARLSON No big deal. 

01:53:50
DIANE KJOS Wow! 

01:53:55
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

01:53:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:53:55
STEVEN ANDREAS It looks good to me. I mean, ultimately the… the real test isn’t reality. 

01:54:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:54:00
STEVEN ANDREAS And you don’t… you never know for sure. Some other part can pop up, they could be some other objection. People don’t always think of all the different aspects of things. You’re doing your best with the person who is here and ultimately the… the real road test is on reality. 

01:54:15
DIANE KJOS Is it… Is it pretty common that the person comes in with… with one issue or one problem and then there’s something underneath, because… you know, she started out with this… 

01:54:25
JON CARLSON Oh, yeah! 

01:54:25
DIANE KJOS Very minor kind of registration thing and all of a sudden there is this boyfriend. 

01:54:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Yeah! 

01:54:30
DIANE KJOS Is that pretty common thing? 

01:54:30
STEVEN ANDREAS Sure, often that’s the case. Now, you call it a minor thing, she’s… but she’s responding. I guess she yelled and screamed and I don’t know what she did. 

01:54:40
DIANE KJOS Hmm…hmm… 

01:54:40
STEVEN ANDREAS But she saw it as a real problem. And she’s probably got other problems so probably plenty of other pieces of work she could do, but this is when I asked her, you know, what change would you like to make today? That’s what she came up with. 

01:54:55
DIANE KJOS Do think that making some piece with the boyfriend would then affect the other types of, I would guess they would, other types of encounters that she has too. 

01:55:00
STEVEN ANDREAS Oh, sure! Oh, yeah! And she had all the list of them, it wasn’t just the registrar or other people in her life where she had been blowing up and getting angry and that she generalized all of those. 

01:55:10
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:55:10
JON CARLSON Well, thanks for giving us some insight into some processes that we can use as we encounter the clients in our future. Thank you Steve. 

01:55:20
STEVEN ANDREAS Thank you.
