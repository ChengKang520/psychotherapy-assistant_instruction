The Diagnosis and Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, By Barry L. Jackson, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
BARRY JACKSON Okay, as we get started, look at your score and let's just go through the Just For Fun score scale here and see where you landed and I'll point out my purpose in doing this in a moment. If you have one or, 1.5 or less, you've answered dishonestly. Go back and redo it, or you're delusional or very, very healthy. You choose, I don't care which one, you decide. You're the clinician. 1.6 to 2.8 you're normal like most of us. You do things and sometimes lead into this OCD kind of casually. How many of you have ever done some of these, let's, let's look at the first score. How many of you worried about your waist size? Be honest, raise your hand. Yes, very good, very good. I see the men are honest too. After menopause, a woman gets you know worried about what happens, okay. Well okay, men don't have menopause but we get beer bellies. And some of us do worry about that. Recheck to make certain the lights were out. Anybody? Ever, no you don't care? Yes, a couple, couple, worried about their electric bill. Yea, okay. Wash your hands several times in a single day? Yea, okay, nothing wrong with that. Okay, hygiene. Counted stairs as you go up or down.Yea, I confess to this. When I'm really stressed I sometimes count stairs. I attribute it to the fact that I have progressive bifocals and I can't see the, where I'm stepping. You know, I got to really look down. So I count, it's not the real reason. That's what I attribute it to. Arrange a coffee break, arrange your office or desk multiple times before starting your work. Never? I do. It's a way of procrastinating. I'm glad to see I've got another one over there like I am. Unable to sleep without your bedtime ritual. This must be the healthiest guy in the world. He hasn't raised his hand once. Oh okay. Thought about what if, what if. Okay, I'm a what-if'er. Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The instruction is, I beg your pardon, the instructions are on that list somewhere. Anyway, you take 'em and you divide 'em. You take your score, add it up, divide it by the number of questions. Very simple. So let's, let's resume. Let's start over and everybody calculate your score. I want to see how healthy you are. All, all the parts, all the parts. Yes, all your scores. 

00:03:45
[sil.] 

00:03:55
BARRY JACKSON Now if you thought any of the questions in number one were unreasonable, score that. This is a sad day when we can't do simple math and we need to resort to our, he'd rather be delusional. Yes, yea, it's a good way to get through the day. People really like me, oh that's a delusion. People came to my workshop because they enjoyed me, yea. That's a delusion. The point in this exercise, while you, while you're calculating your scores, is to point out that normal people do things that might be considered abnormal and this is particularly concerned if you look at the new DSM criteria. I'm not here to teach about the DSM but I would, would point out that it is total revamping. If you haven't read it, you need to read it and understand, go to a workshop or a couple workshops and understand the whole theoretical base from the DSM to the 5 has changed dramatically. I've been in the profession 44 years and I've seen them all and it's really changed dramatically. The current one is based essentially on Harry Stack Sullivan's theory of human development. If you're not familiar with it, go back and read Harry Stack Sullivan. You remember the name. Go back and reread him. Essentially the theory is that what happens in childhood determines what happens as an adult. All behaviors after childhood are subsequently traced back to childhood and we just have to go back there and find these things. As a result of this, the entire field and the way you look at things has shifted. Now I won't go further than that. Some areas have been declassified, like Ausperger's syndrome is gone. It doesn't exist anymore, OCD is a whole new category by itself. So you'll see some really big changes. A lot of controversy about what got included and what didn't get included. A lot of scandal about the drug companies getting some people surreptitiously onto the committees. And there are a whole series of things we could go on all day and talk about. What I find is interesting is there's a change in this whole way of understanding Axis 1, axis 2, axis 3, axis 4 and that whole thing. Global functioning is all changed. You need, you need to become aware of that. And in that change, I think the thing that concerns me the most is that in some instances it lowers the threshold for diagnosis. And as I perceive that, it makes normal behavior like you just described, abnormal. I have some concerns about that, so I gave this little test just as a, poke some fun, get your attention at things. But there is, I think, a more serious side that we are I think in danger of making everybody mentally ill. Yes. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Do you have a very quick description of what the axis business is? 

00:07:35
BARRY JACKSON No. No, essentially they're gone. They're just gone. You still have to meet so many criteria, but the number of criteria have been diminished, in some cases. I just recommend you read it very carefully or go to a couple workshops. I spent four days in a workshop in early May and then I went back in June to another workshop that was given by the APA. Two very different people, two very different approaches to the same information. Just a lot of controversy. I have a close friend who was on the committee and they're all, by the way, they've all been sworn to secrecy and had to sign statements, non-disclosure statements, which is very interesting to me. Never before has that happened, so. So anyway that's my advertisement. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Do we know what the basis of this sworn to secrecy is? 

00:08:45
BARRY JACKSON I don't know. I have been told in the workshops two different stories. Essentially there was a lot of in-fighting and at least in one situation one thing that everybody on the committee, central committee agreed on except one person. And they wanted that eliminated, and that item got in because that one person wanted it. That was an influential person. There are, apparently there are so many politics involved and so much pressure involved that from various groups, a lot of things are left open to question. Now there's going to be a walk over, a cross over if you know what that means. There's going to be a tie in between the ICD and the DSM, in terms of numbers. A walk-over so you will be able to know numbers. That is in the new DSM already. You'll see the new numbers. Now that's not going to take place for another two years. For some people said why are we even publishing this now, why don't we just wait until the new ICD is done. Again, they spent somewhere around twenty million dollars. The previous one was something like two million, to try to get this published. And the pharmaceutical corporations put most of the money up for the bill. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Sorry, I'm just trying to follow along. What, I don't know what ICD or T is. 

00:10:20
BARRY JACKSON The ICD, International Code for Diagnosis or Diseases. It's what the physicians use. It's widely used in, well, probably here when you're in medicine. Certainly it's used all over Europe. When I've spoken there, some people were using the ICD, some were using the DSM. If you're a psychiatrist, you're probably using the ICD. If you're a psychologist or a counselor, you're probably using the DSM. Okay. All right, I just wanted to put that there because there are some significant changes in the OCD and for our purposes, clinically the same criteria exists. That has not changed. The severity is changed and that's part of what's gone now. The axis are gone and now you have to judge the severity. And I find that interesting too because that somewhat subjective based on which clinician is reading which kind of things. So, with that in mind, we'll trudge forward. If you have questions and don't want to wait, do feel free to raise your hand and I will pass the microphone around. And because they don't have a little clicker that allows me to wander around the room, they have enough of them but I didn't ask early enough I guess, so I will have to stand up here and click away. Is this microphone working? Yes it is. I will put this one on the table and if people have questions, please someone polite enough to hand it to them, I'd appreciate it, thank you. Don't bang on the table. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:30
BARRY JACKSON We're going to talk about prevalence today. Diagnostic criteria, making the diagnosis, and we're going to have some case presentations and each table will get a case and you'll work through that and we'll have a few minutes then for you to come up with a decision, a rationale for that decision, and then we'll share it with the group. So you'll want to identify who's going to be the spokesperson and remember, you're on camera, so if you volunteer, you're going to be filmed. We'll look at standard treatment interventions and then we'll kind of wrap it up and ask questions and so forth, okay. The DSM 4 and 5, we'll just kind of summarize it by that way, the code in the old manual was 300.3. You have several criteria you must meet. I'm not good at standing in one place. I apologize to my technician over there. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
BARRY JACKSON The requirements in order to get a diagnosis of OCD really are recurrent, persistent, upsetting thoughts severe enough to cause marked distress. This is directly out of the manual. Or significant impairment in daily activities. Now this is important and there's actually a definition of what significant impairment is. It requires one hour of activity related either thinking about it, working on it, every day. One hour. That's what's identified as significant. These recurrent thoughts motivate an individual to create and repeat ritualistic behaviors which are intended to reduce or control these thoughts. The changes here came out in May of 2013. They were already I think two or three years late and there are still people on the committee that thought it should have been later yet. They're highly controversial as I've indicated, and now as I've also indicated, there is a chapter specific to OCD. There are some new specifiers and a way in which we look at the OCD behavior. Let's talk a little bit about prevalence. Now I think it's important that you recognize that the data that we look at from the United States really mirrors what we see in the world, about one percent of the US population annually has a problem with OCD. In a lifetime, about two and half percent have this recurring problem. The World Health Organization rates, says that these rates are typical across the world. There are several implications for that. One is culture is not a factor. If we see this in all cultures at about the same rates. Gender's also not a factor. We see it in males and females at about similar rates. So gender and culture are not factors in this which leads us to look at some other things like brain development, neurobiology. So there's good indication that whatever is going on is neurochemical. There's another indication about this and that is age is a factor. For whatever reasons, onset of male behavior can be very young, as early as 6. Generally by age 15 in males we see this behavior. In women, it comes on much later, between 20 and 29. We don't know why. We just know this is the case, and again, we see this across cultures. So it's not a cultural artifact. The DSM has five criteria that one looks at. First, recurrent obsessions or compulsions, not both. You can have both, but it doesn't have to be both. Obsessions or compulsions, and we'll talk more about those definitions. They must cause significant distress, impairment, and consume at least one hour daily. A person must realize the excessive or unreasonable nature of the compulsions, so I have to realize that what they're compelled to do is unreasonable. That does not apply to children, so when you're looking at a child, they may not have the cognitive awareness to recognize that what they're doing is unreasonable. You know, it's beyond their comprehension perhaps. In the presence of another axis one disorder, content is not restricted to that disorder. Now that's in the old DSM 4 is your still using it. Okay, that axis has to be looked at. In the new DSM, 5, that axis is gone, however, if you think about it in terms of what those conditions were under axis one, then they're the same conditions. If they exist, then you may or may not have OCD behavior. All right, is that clear? Many of you are probably operating on the DSM 4 TR still. You know, some agencies are. The United States, they're using both and in other cultures that I've spoken, they're still using the 4, some because they just don't want to move to the 5 because they don't like it, others because their agencies or the insurance companies or whoever's reimbursing them hasn't moved up to the 5 yet. The disturbance is not the result of substances or general medical condition. So I'm not having these compulsions because of some physical illness, okay. Now let's look at the specifiers. Recurrent, intrusive, images thoughts must impulses also occur in other disorders, for instance, body dismorphic disorder, specific or social phobias, triptilomania which now by the way they simplified it. It's just hair pulling. So for those of you who have had difficulty pronouncing this or spelling it, you don't have to worry anymore. 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN What's body dismorphic disorder? 

00:19:20
BARRY JACKSON Body dismorphic disorder can come in several formats. Most typically, it is a situation where I think my nose is too large so I have it operated on. I think my belly doesn't show enough of my six pack or eight pack, so I have a tummy tuck, liposuction. And there are some stars, people like Joan Rivers or Cher, a musician, who certainly from all outward appearances would probably qualify. They have multiple surgeries to improve their appearance. They're never satisfied with whatever happens. Again, this was you know probably what Michael Jackson had as he was you know bleaching his skin color and having multiple facial surgeries. So that's one aspect of it. The outward behaviors, they physically have themselves altered. Sometimes it can be simply, I don't like my appearance so I exercise to death, which can also then qualify as a eating disorders or those kinds of things as well. Yes? 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN I've got a client who well, let's just say, doesn't like can't have any relationship with his genitals. Does that, is that dismorhpic or does it actually have to get to the point of surgery or 

00:20:55
BARRY JACKSON It doesn't have to get to the point of surgery but the reality he may not like his genitalia for whatever reason. There might be something other than this that would be appropriate diagnosis. But no, it doesn't have to result in surgery, It can be just saying I'm ugly, my nose is too big, my penis is too small, whatever. 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN He doesn't, he hasn't looked at it, you know, in decades, as in 

00:21:15
BARRY JACKSON Yea 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN But anyway, okay, that answers the question. 

00:21:20
BARRY JACKSON Yea, again, there may be other things going on and I'd be happy to talk to you later about that but as a clinician, you have a better knowledge than I would of him because I've never seen him. Yea. Anxiety disorders, major depression, all of these can have these persistent, recurrent thoughts, the what-if's you know, the fears that are unreasonable. These are the kinds of things that you may see in other disorders and so they have to be ruled out. Now they can co-occur with OCD and that, that's another tricky issue. They can be co-occurring. Does the behavior have a compulsion that provides pleasure? This is one of the specifiers. For instance, eating disorders. Initially, eating disorders, sexual paraphylias, psychological gambling, substance abuse, all of these you may feel compelled to do, but at least initially they're chosen kinds of behaviors to some extent and they bring pleasure. You get some fun out of it. I drink and hey, I like being drunk. After a while, you're no longer in control of that drinking. you're no longer in control of that drug use, you're no longer in control of, of the eating disorder. It now controls you. And so that is one of the specifiers, so body dismorphic behavior, I may feel my nose is ugly or my belly's too fat but I don't binge and purge. I don't exercise myself to death. That becomes a different disorder. Neither the obsession nor the compulsion are pleasurable to the patient. So my obsession with clean hands, and then the activities I do to clean my hands, they become unpleasant. And that's a key specifier because if they are providing some kind of pleasure, then it doesn't qualify as an OCD. Yes, there's a question. 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN I have a client, he, he's priphasia, 45 years old. He, is okay? he try any opportunity in public his penis. His penis front ladies. He really enjoy it. He doesn't enjoy sex with his wife, he enjoy touch himself, he couldn't control it to explore his body to young ladies. He enjoy it, but problem he worry his workmate, his boss, know this happen. He worry to catch in prison. That's he worry. 

00:24:20
BARRY JACKSON Well, there mere fact under the OCD diagnosis, the mere fact that he enjoys doing this disqualifies it for that diagnosis. That would have to come under something else. A sexual paraphylia or sexual disorder of some sort. So it's not OCD the minute you say, well, he enjoys it. That disqualifies it under these rules. Okay, you may or may not agree with those. You may disagree with the rules but that is the diagnostic criteria rules. Okay. Again under the axis one disorders, here are some of the things that patients with OCD may have that are co-occurring. Major depression, about 52% of people with OCD are also depressed and attempt suicide, attempt or complete. So we see suicide ideation very high in OCD people and depression is very much related to that. Generalized or specific phobias. I'm afraid of simple things. A specific phobia might be, as a kid you grew up and you're walking down a sidewalk and they have the lines and cracks in the sidewalk and you say oh, the old game, if you step on a crack, you break your mother's back. We'd laugh and oh ha ha, we knew it wasn't real, but some people begin to think that's real. If I do this, somebody else will be injured. And so they avoid doing certain things. I won't step on a crack, you know, whatever. You ever watch the TV show, the American situation comedy investigative show called Monk. This guy is, he could keep us all employed forever with his phobias and his, his paranoid behavior. He certainly was OCD among other things, as a character. Substance abuse and addiction, they're about self-explanatory. I don't think I need to talk about that. Avoidant personality disorder. Again people avoid things for specific reasons and there's a high connection with OCD behavior. I don't, I don't want to interact with people because I'm afraid that they won't accept me because I'm obsessed about my appearance, or whatever. There are a whole series of things. I'm sure you could come up, everyone here could come up with an example or maybe five. Learning or disruptive behaviors, Turret's disorder, again a high number of OCD people have Turret's sydrome. 35 to 50 percent of Turret's people also suffer OCD. So if you have some of these conditions, any of these seven, you'd want to look at it. And finally obsessive compulsive personality disorder and there is a difference. So I need, if you're not familiar with it, you do need to read what a personality disorder is and go back to that. That's different than a behavior disorder. But there is a lot of overlap. And clinically you'll get a little bit here some cases where you're going to have to make those kinds of determinations. That's what the case study will be about, or one of them anyway. The obsessive compulsive personality disorder comes under 301.4 in the DSM. There is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfection and control. Orderly, orderliness, perfection, and control. Symptoms must begin in early adulthood and have no obsessions. And that's a clear thing. There's not obsessions, there's not compulsions. They're just absolutely perfectionists. Now a co-occurring disorder with that, anyone can guess? Very common. Eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa, and bulimia, both very much associated with a young woman, very much associated with this personality disorder. Now young men are frequently not looked at in this area. However, working at a university with sports teams, I found two categories that I looked at all the time and a third one which I didn't because we just didn't have a team. Gymnastics, swimming, anyone want to guess the third. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN Ballet 

00:29:10
BARRY JACKSON We didn't have a ballet. She said ballet. Yes I would say that would be there. But I'm specifically thinking about young men and sports activities. We didn't have ballet at the university. University wrestling, Olympic style wrestling. Collegiate interactive wrestling, and why, because all of those focus on weight. There are weight classes and those kind of things, so swimming was a big issue for men and women. They're in those little lycra outfits and they show absolutely every ounce, lots of other things too. But the issue for a lot young women and young men in those sports is perfection of their body and it's not just because they're trying to be better at the sport. It is largely their appearance, and so that's an issue. Yes, there's q question, please? 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Just if you can help with what looks unfamiliar for me, it's an obsessive compulsive personality disorder that symptoms must not involve obsessions or compulsions. Can you try to explain that? 

00:30:25
BARRY JACKSON I can't tell you the rationale that they, this committee came up with. I can tell you that what they're looking at is you're not doing ritualistic behaviors of saying I've got to wipe the doorknob ten times before I touch it. It's more a concern about your own personal perfection, did I write a perfect paper? You might rewrite that paper 25 times before you turn it into the professor and still think it's not good enough. Even though you get an A plus or an A plus plus. You get a hundred and he give you ten extra points. It wasn't good enough. I look at that as a compulsion to be perfect. The team that put this together in the first place did not. So that's that striving for perfection. A lot of that is also connected with inappropriate not necessarily behaviors but inappropriate thoughts that children have about their parents. Usually the opposite sex so daughters with fathers, sons with mothers, and wanting to be accepted and loved so on, so there's a whole lot of those things which you don't see in obsessive compulsive disorder. You know, I'm not worried about you know, I'm a girl and I don't worry about whether I'm going to disappoint Daddy because I'm not perfect. In personality disorder, yes that can be an essential element of what you see. That's just one example. There was a question over here. Can we pass the microphone over? 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN I'm interested to know what if you have any experience. I've checked out some of the literature in relation to sexual abuse and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. And there's some comparison there as you were saying with the eating disorders about the need for the control. And a lot of the clients who I have worked with have experienced sexual abuse, have had a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive personality disorder and I wanted to know if you had any findings in that area. Well the answer is there's a lot of correlation between relationship issues with daughter and father, son and mother. We see it more often with daughter and father, and that I think is somewhat culturally determined. I can get into that in length, and I'll try not to. But some behaviors in our culture are more accepted by the culture for women to behave and not for men. An example would be, you may see this a little far-fetched but it is related, if I slept in the same bed with my 11 year old daughter would you accept that as being okay? No, that's that, see I'm seeing heads going no, no, no. But if you slept with your 10 year old or 11 year old son in the same bed, the culture would accept that. Same behavior, different gender. So we, we assume automatically, this is the underlying cultural assumption said if you're as a man sleeping the same bed with your daughter, you're doing something sexual, and that's bias that's built into our culture. You probably haven't thought about it. I've experienced this. I raised my two children by myself, and it's was very interesting. I like kids and I would see a child, even today if I see a child in a restaurant and you know, it's looking over at me and staring and I just wave back, if I'm by myself, what do you think women think of me. She's smiling, she says yea, that dirty old man you know. He's a pervert. You know, but if a woman does that, that's perfectly acceptable. Oh come on over and talk to the baby. Oh gee, hold my baby. If I say gee, can I hold your baby? Are you kidding? You must be a pervert. So there are sexual things underlying a cultural assumptions. Women frequently, as I deal with men's and women's groups, don't recognize their cultural biases against men on certain issues, just like women say men don't recognize their biases against women. I mean it goes both ways, and I'm not trying to start an argument with anybody on feminism or whatever, chauvinism, I don't want to get into that, but it is an element of what we see in diagnostic categories. Another interesting one that would show this up as well, women are, tend, tend to get personality disorder labels when men get other labels for the same behavior. Okay, you're a borderline personality disorder because you object to things and you feel aggression but you don't act on it. A man who acts on it, what is he? Anti- personal or anti-social personality disorder. You're just narcissistic, histrionic, but we're brutal so we're violent so we're anti-social. So you see these kind of things that are somewhat culturally underlying how we diagnose things. And so you do need to be aware of that. The same behavior in a woman, in violent behavior, will not necessarily, generally, not be labelled the same way as though a man. And we see this also, it's riddled throughout our culture, western culture. Women do certain behaviors and they're put in prison for less time than men. In fact, there was no recorded history of a serial killer in the United States who was a women until Karen Warren, it was in the 1970's. They simply didn't even look for women when they did the profiling, the psychologists and the FBI, they were looking for a man who was killing other men. They assumed he must be a gay guy and so they totally missed her for about a dozen years because they assumed that women just don't do these things and that's just not true. Same thing is true now with women who are schoolteachers sexually assaulting their pupils. You know, famous case in the United States, the woman slept with her twelve year old pupil who was an islander who looked a lot older than twelve and you know she was married and had sex with him and had kids with him and all that, and they gave her house detention. Can you imagine a 30 year old man sleeping with his twelve year old student. He gets life in jail. So there are, you know, it's riddled throughout our culture and these are they're biases. Now I know that's going far afield from where we are but the correlation that you want to know about is are there correlations? Yes, correlation as you know doesn't mean causation. And that's the point of my saying these other things. There are biases in there that make us look at it as it's correlated. It may not be the cause, it just may be related in some way and we don't necessarily know what's caused it. However, there is some evidence and that was specifically your question, that inappropriate sexual behavior between father and daughter leads to eating disorders. There is some, and suicide and all the other attendant kind of things that are co-occurring. Now inappropriate sexual behavior is somewhat culturally determined. There's some cultures in which you are expected to learn your sexuality from your parent, and that may be your mother who's teaching a young man to masturbate. I encountered that in a culture. So we would see that as child abuse. So one has to be careful how we look at it, and that's one of the difficulties I see with cross-cultural counseling, that we cannot escape our culture and we walk into another culture and we're presuming things which to them, no big deal. You know, incest, we consider that terrible, but in some cultures, you know it's not all that bad. You know, it's not life damaging. So, but yes, and we have another question so, and then we're going to move on 'cause I'll be too far afield and we'll run out of time. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN I have client, he's 22 years old, closer, okay. 22 years old, this boy has sex with mother. Mother 42, he starts sex with mother when he was 20, and they both were happy so they kept going. But now how to deal with 

00:39:15
BARRY JACKSON Well, again, I'm not going to try to pass judgment. Let me just make another comment. The old Maude Taylor song, I went to college and you know, she became my lover and she was much older than me and I woke up in the morning and kicked me in the head and that kind of stuff. Do you know that song? Anybody? Okay, several of you do. It's very interesting. If I as an older man go out with an older woman, I'm robbing the cradle, you know, whatever. If a older woman goes out with a young man and has sex, he's lucky. Right? He's lucky. But if a younger woman has sex with me, he raped her. Oh boy you know what he wants. So there are different underlying values and prejudices that our genders have. It's just the way it is. So, incest, you know, mom and son sleeping together, well we have laws against that so I guess that makes it wrong. And now I'm not condoning it, it's not, it's not that. It's just I don't know how to answer that question culturally neutral. I don't know how. Let's move on. Several common themes that we see among obsessions and compulsions. DSM does not specify the nature of the content by the way, or form of an obsession or a compulsion. Clinical practice however has given us some clue as to various themes that are fairly common. Causing harm to yourself, cutting. And you see this again, just because they're cutting or beating themselves up doesn't mean that they're OCD. That, that's a symptom that you see in other things. So you have to be careful about that. Attacking others, beating others up. Again, you see these in other issues so you have to be careful. Contamination from dirt and germs. Very common, Howard Hughes, Michael Jackson, they were always concerned about it. You know I'm going to have to wear a mask and... in some cultures, my son is, son in law is Japanese. I went to Japan with him and everybody was wearing a mask. You know, in Tokyo, I could see it. The air is so dirty, but even in outlying areas where the air was clean they were wearing masks. They're afraid of getting the flu from somebody else. Not all of them, but you see it in a significant population. Is that obsessive compulsive? Well, maybe by our standards but by their cultural standards, no, it, it's normal. So again, you have to be somewhat sensitive to these issues. Making and forgetting important things, or, mistakes and forgetting important things. I'm afraid I'm going to make a mistake. I'm afraid I'm going to you know forget something so I come up with a solution, I make lists. You know I have to admit, that's my compulsion, I make lists and I count steps. Committing a sin. Some cultures are very sin dominated. Again, I can't do this, it's wrong, it's a sin, I'll go to hell. If you're not a believer, well that seems kind of strange to you but in their context, it makes sense. Committing homosexual or pedophilic acts. That's becoming, homosexual behavior is becoming more and more accepted worldwide but there're still cultures that will kill you for it. You know, off with your head. Pornographic images. And these aren't necessarily looking at them. Some people are driven to look at them. Some just imagine them. So we have to kind of deal with those issues. Compulsions. Hand washing for dirt, germs, contamination. Checking, rechecking to avoid mistakes, such as check everything. I go back and, and make sure you know I left Wellington New Zealand and I made sure that I turned off the water heater and I turned, you know, unplugged the television and I turned off all the lights and I disconnnected this that and the other thing. Why? Because we might have an earthquake when I'mg gone. That's a real probability, you know, over there, but I do these things and that's fine. Do I go back and check them, and how many times? That's a compulsion. Okay. It's not so much that I do these things out of caution. It's do I go back and question it. I'm on the airplane flying for four hours. Oh did I, did I turn this off, did I turn that off? One solution that many OCD people have is they simply make a list and then they go through and they check it when they've done. Then they get on the airplane and say yea, and they check that list about ten times. So they're still obsessive compulsive, they're not actually physically checking, did they turn the light off. They're checking their list. Did I really turn that off? Oh yea I checked it. I guess I did. So these are some of the kinds of things you'll see. Confessions, prayer, people who go you know in and confess ten times in a week. And there are people like that. I started out as a Lutheran minister and you'd be amazed sometimes what people come in and tell you and it's a sin, it's like where did you get that idea? I mean it's, you had an extra piece of chocolate, you know. Yea, but I, my mother told me not to. Okay. All right. Counting, rearranging, avoiding, forgetting, losing items, making lists avoiding forgetting. So these are the kinds of things. Hoarding, and hoarding's become a, a more obvious issues nowadays because they have those shows on television, reality tv, hoarders. God, they need help. Compulsions. People with OCD usually attempt to ignore or suppress a thought initially. That's what they try to do, and they use thoughts to avoid these things. That's their initial response. It doesn't work so they escalate to repetitive behaviors and then they develop rules about these behaviors. Now interestingly enough, the behavior themselves do not have to relate to the activity. Most times we think, oh well, he turns a doorknob fifty times, what, what's his problem? Oh he must have been locked out as a child. It may have absolutely nothing to do with that, but he's going to turn that knob a certain way, going to turn it three times to the right, four times to the left, once back to the right and then I can open it, like it's a combination lock. It may have absolutely nothing to do with the obsession, but they've ritualized it in a way that it relieves the tension that they feel. These obsessions cause them tension. They cause them physical and emotional pain. And I say physical because some people physically are so anxious and nervous that, that they'll get sick, they'll have diarrhea, they'll vomit, they'll, they'll do all sorts of things that are, you know, very uncomfortable for them. So they're looking for a relief. As the disorder progresses, the rules get more and more complicated. So one of the ways you can look at how long this person's been involved and how terrible the situation is for them is look at how complicated are the rules. And I've had a couple patients where I've said, can you write down the rules for me? And the answer is yes, in great specificity. Six, seven pages in some case in very you know small writing and they, they tend to be very obsessive about how they write it. Diagnostic challenges. Diagnosis is often missed for a very long time and it really amazed me when I was reading through the literature a couple of years ago in preparation of this particular workshop. On average, 17 years after the first obsessive compulsive onset before it's finally diagnosed. 17 years. So it becomes extremely ingrained and it becomes more difficult. And again, if we think back to this morning's lecture about behaviors and the neurobiological connection, think of how much undoing you have to do biologically, to get rid of this thinking. That's why it's so tough. It's not just the behavior, it's ritual. It's ingrained in our, the imprint of the brain mechanisms. Generally, it's 11 years. 17 years before the first incident. About 11 years before it technically meets the criteria for the DSM. So you see a progression of about, on average, six years before it gets to the point where it's really now involving time of about an hour or more a day which then is necessary. So prior to that, it may be involving time but it's not meeting those criteria of an hour or more, so it is, it's disruptive but it's more mild. If we identified and dealt with 17 years earlier, how much easier would it be to correct? But a lot of it goes undiagnosed because people are embarrassed, they're ashamed. It's not recognized, it's low level initially. Is there anything wrong with counting steps going up and down? No, I don't think so. No, and i notice I do it when I'm really stressed. It's probably a good thing because I live in an old house that has very steep stairs. It was built in the late 1700s, very steep stairs and very narrow treads. If I'm carrying something, it's good to know how many steps there are. There are 13 exactly. I don't know why they decided 13. That wasn't a lucky number but you know, see that's a disorder right. We're worried about lucky 13 or unlucky 13. Okay, denial. A sense that they cannot get, you know, things under control but if they were strong willed they could. What else do you see this with? What other disorder? Anybody? Addictions, yes, addictions, we see this all the time. If I was just strong, in fact, we have this bias. I do a whole workshop on this. Is addictions a mental disorder or a moral failure? You know, the field is split. Some people say you know it's a moral failure, if they would just be strong. AA's position is pretty much that. You know, and so they give you lots of support and I'm not criticizing, they're effective. But that's pretty much the underlying thing is that, you know, we're going to help you redo your life through the twelve steps. We're going to help you fix this problem through the twelve steps. If you just work the program, you'll get better. That's the philosophy. Again, it works. I'm not critical of it. I'm just saying that's the philosophy. Then other people say well, no it's a brain disorder and if we correct the neurobiological aspects of it, we'll do away with it. And those people frequently want to give you drugs. So you see the difference. Or they want to give you maintenance drugs, you know, methadone for addictions. Those kind of things. So we see delays. Waxing and waning of symptoms. They come and they go. Do I always count the steps? No. I notice that when I'm tired or I'm stressed, I count steps. Do I always make lists? No. I notice when i'm tired or stressed, and getting up here to do a workshop, I make lists of things I want to cover. You know, ironically, my list is sitting over there. I probably won't even look at it but I made it and that may, that reduced stress. Yea, I'm probably diagnosable. I'll come and see you for treatment. He said, David said, Good. Co-morbid disorders. That's the biggest thing that hides it. It's frequently ignored because it looks like some other thing which we treat, and then we wonder why they're not getting better. Because we're not really treating the right thing and our clients don't tell us. They lie to us. There is such a thing you know as I want to get better because I want to please my client, or my counselor, so I pretend to get better. And then I'm feeling really good, oh I'm doing great and they pretend. And then two days later they commit suicide and you wonder why. Would you hand this lady the microphone please? Thank you. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN With regards to the, the lying situation, you know the client having the problem, they might lie about it. Is that always necessarily true or they not necessarily aware of, of the cause of it, like for example someone may say that they had a bad experience prior and that's why they do what they do now, and then maybe their belief. They may not necess-, so it may not necessarily be a lie, if you know what I mean? 

00:52:45
BARRY JACKSON Yes, I do. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Distinguishing the difference between the lie and the person knowing. 

00:52:55
BARRY JACKSON If they believe it to be true, it's not a lie by definition. Okay, so that's the first response. They believe it to be true, therefore it is true for them. They're not lying. It's when they are specifically hiding it from their therapist because they want to give a better impression. The second thing is to keep in mind, if they're truly not aware, then it doesn't meet OCD because you have to have awareness. Remember that's one of the five criteria. You must be aware of the situation and what's causing it and what's happening and going on. So that, that's, now aware in the sense of maybe not the ultimate underlying reason why you're this way but you have to be aware that you are this way and it's causing problems. Okay. Clinical interview, no big social, or no big surprise to all of you here, you're clinicians you know. A thorough biopsychosocial history is essential. You need to look at all of these things. Current symptoms, age at onset is important and so you really want to look at that to see, and the reason it's so important is because you want to know how long this has been going on to see the severity to some extent and under the DSM 5 severity becomes a real critical issue here for the diagnosis. Effective life functions. What is it effecting, how is it effecting them? You know, severe cases, it begins to interfere with their life and work and in their marriage and in all sorts of things. Safety evaluation. Are they safe? Are the things they're doing harmless? I count stairs going downstairs. That's harmless. That's going to hurt me, it's not going to hurt anybody else. Unless I miscount, you know, maybe then I take a header. Psychiatric history. Looking at other issues. Again, this is co-morbid kind of situation. You want to see are some of their symptoms coming from something other than what you thing it is? Presence of other psychiatric disorders, family history. There is a component of family history kinds of things where one parent is OCD, the child may be, or a brother or a sister. So we do see some connections in that way. Really uncertain why. The neurobiologists say, well it's genetic. I'm unaware of any evidence that that's true. I don't know. General medical history. You want to know things again because there may be co-occurring disorders that are there. A disorder may be physiological one that looks like a psychological one. Early stages of MS can also look like mental disorders. So you need to be aware of that. So there are some things that you should try to rule out and get a good history on them. Screening tools created, OCD evaluation, consistent checklists, measure of level of severity, used before during and after. It's important you get a baseline so you do it before, when you first diagnose this, get some information, use some of these checklists, use some of these things. And then periodically check to see whether or not you're client is telling you the truth. And then at the end. So you can see whether or not there's been progress made. These are some of the instruments. All of this information is available on the disk that was given to you. I know some of you are fiercely writing down things. It is on the disk, so... these are some of the tests that are used that were not specifically designed for OCD behaviors but have proven effective in some, some ways. Behavioral avoidance test is kind of interesting because it can be used for avoidant behavior disorder as well as OCD. So, and several of the other things obviously. I'm moving us along because I want to get to the case studies and we're already after four. We started at, about ten minutes late, so I would like to try to keep us close to four thirty. OCD diagnosis, again only appropriate if all five criteria are met. And these are the criteria I went over previously. Some of the standards treatments, I'm going to go through these fairly quickly. Theoretical approach is psychoanalytic. Remember, Harry Stack Sullivan is a psychoanalytic theorist, Freudian sort of background. And the DSM 5 is more or less built on that theoretical principle. Assumes that early personal history and childhood development coping mechanisms determines the existence, course, and severity. Treatment focuses on early influences, family, relationships, their impact on development. Techniques regression, displacement, reaction formation are learned. Those kind of things. Remission of symptoms through isolation and undoing techniques. Treatment outcomes, evidence is poor. I can whip through this fairly quickly because what we do know is that all the evidence in medianalytic research, all the evidence in the individual studies is really lacking. It is not strong evidence at all. It's much more anecdotal in some cases. We just don't see a lot of progress. One of the problems is psychoanalysis can take years. And frequently when you're doing really, really long work with an OCD patient, they drop out because they're not seeing any benefit and this is so painful for them, they look for something else. And that something else may be alcohol, drugs, or suicide. Or other things. Cognitive theory states that expectations of beliefs about threats, control and responsibility influence anxious responses to neutral stimuli, to neural, so there's something to neural stimuli, there's something that's out there. We respond to it, become anxious. The focus is on the perceptions, internal thoughts, images and belief systems which affect behavior in the presence of intrusive ideas. The old ABC model of Ellis. Beck's RET. I find interesting the probability estimates and responsibility applied. Probability estimates are simply, you've known young men, your friends coming home from little league playing baseball, and you're all walking down the sidewalk and you're avoiding stepping on the cracks. The other kids re stepping on them.Did any of their parents, their mother have a broken back? No. Did you ever step on a crack? Yea by accident. I told my mom. Did she have a broken back? No. So what do you think the probability is that you stepping on this is going to cause your mother to have a broken back? Oh, uh, well but I still can't do it. And so you begin to do cognitive reframing essentially. So probability estimates are interesting. Give me an estimate of what do you will happen if this happens, what do you think the estimate of this will happen? And then when this happens, you say okay, you said it will happen one out of five times. Okay, let's do it five times and see what happens. And it never happens. I mean you do it five times and nothing happens. Oh. You must have been wrong. So it's a way of getting people to look at it differently. Responsibility pies are the same issue. If, you divide up the responsibility. All right, this did happen but what's the reality? How responsible were you for this behavior? And did something you do really cause this behavior? Yes? 

01:01:25
UNKNOWN How do you get the person to actually do that testing? My experience is you say say oh let's do it, well they can't even do it once. So how do you actually get them to do that test? 

01:01:40
BARRY JACKSON Yea, there are several techniques, one of which is, I say, well would that be true of me, if I stepped on a crack what would happen? Well I don't know. Well let, let's see. I step on a crack and nothing happened. Okay, do you think you might risk doing this? No. But it might take a while, so you test out realities and you find out where they can in fact do something and then you have them do it in a controlled environment, and if nothing happens, then you say, oh that's probably an unrealistic belief, false belief so let, let's kind of rethink some things. And you know it's not going to happen in one day. It's not going to happen in two or three sessions. It's going to be a progressive thing where the person begins to rethink and re-challenge their own assumptions about life. 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN Can I just check something here because my experience, just talking with the couple of clients that I have, is that they're very aware that it's not rational and they absolutely go along with exactly what you're saying, but when it comes to actually touching that fear 

01:02:50
BARRY JACKSON And that's why you use a technique of systematic desensitization. So that, that's a very effective technique. Okay. Cognitive, let's see, did I push the wrong thing? CBT. There was a mention this morning about cognitive behavioral therapy and its change in the role of structure. CBT without surprise is the one that has the most success. Behavioral techniques, cognitive behavioral techniques have had the greatest success rates in this OCD behavior. One learns to avoid, learns to fear and avoid, and so we have to learn, unlearn those behaviors. I'm moving here rapidly because I want to get to the case study and I think it's probably about quarter after and we need to move. As thoughts and behaviors are practiced, they become more frequent and less, uh, more distressful so we want to do a reverse of the SR loop. Systemic desensitization, paradoxical intention, that's a nice one I use a lot. And say well, look, I want you to go do this, just go do it. Yea, okay, and they do it, and they see the paradox in something. I'm saying well if I do this I'll be a bad person. Okay, go be a bad person, go do this. And it, it forces them to reconsider whether they're a bad person. I mean so you can find lots of paradoxical techniques. You just prescribe the symptom essentially and people respond. They behave differently. I'm going to move ahead because I think many of you know this stuff. If you don't, I'll be happy to talk to you more about it. Treatment outcomes. Behavioral, well researched, remission in approximately 60 percent of those people. Counseling rates drop by 22 percent so people do get better with behavioral stuff. APA says 13 to 20 weeks. Treatment found most effective in 8 to 10 weekly sessions, or three weeks daily. Exposure and response prevention is most effective. So the more you expose them and the more review it, the more effective it is. This is consistent with what was said this morning. They say around 20 to 25 visits, very consistent in that regard. One of the things that's interesting too is it's been found to be effective instead of these hour long, half hour long. Now I know this morning we talked about 90 minutes might be the optimal, but we found frequent treatment 3 or 4 days or even 5 days a week for half an hour or a phone call. I'll see you three days a week and then you'll check in with me by phone and tell me what's going on. I was thinking about a paradoxical intention. It just kind of came to me, one I use with eating disorders. I'd say to the young woman when was the last time you purged? And she said this morning. And I said well it's four o'clock now. When would you purge? Well about seven. Okay so you've gone nine hours. Okay. Will you promise not to purge again until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning? Can you do that? Yea, I can manage that. And I said and then you can eat all you want and throw up all you want and then see me at four in the afternoon. Inveritably, four in the afternoon they come and I say well how'd you do? Well I didn't eat anything. I ate normally, I didn't throw up. Why, I told you you could. It's a paradoxical intention. You tell them they can do the symptom, and they frequently don't. So, then I'll say well okay you've just gone thirty some hours. You're under control. No it's not going to last all the time. Prepare them for failure. You know, there are going to be times when this happens again. So let's see. Tonight when you go home and you eat what you want to, and you feel the need to you know throw up, go do so. That;s a paradoxical intention, a paradoxical assignment basically. Follow up sessions that are really recommended are over a ten week period, you should do some follow up. Group and family therapy has proven to be very effective and as effective as individual therapy where you involve the family, you talk about issues. Obviously group and family, group in particular, when you get a group of people together with the same disorder and they get to talking, it normalizes. They say, well I'm normal but I'm doing things I don't like. It doesn't normalize the behavior, it normalizes them. They think of themselves as normal, the behavior they don't like. And that, that's very effective and it's lower cost obviously. Insurance companies love it. Your boss will love it. You'll have more productivity and all those kind of things, all those measures that we sometimes get into. Medical approaches, gets into medicines. There are a number of them that have been approved. SSRI's and so forth. Here are the names of those. That handout is on the back table. What is interesting is that none of these medications by themselves have proven to be more effective than CBT. And what we know is that although they give relief and it lasts for a period of time, generally these drugs are given for a two year period and then tie traded off. And what we see is very often a recurrence, a higher recurrence of the disorders in people who have used medications without therapy. Medications and therapy have the greatest impact together. And if you compare therapy alone with medicines alone, therapy alone wins all the way and it's much cheaper. What I'd like to do is get to the summary and then to the cases, so does anyone have the time. I think it's probably twenty past, okay, so you'll have just about ten minutes to complete this assignment. And then we'll spend a few minutes discussing it and then we'll close for the day. I do apologize but we did get started a few minutes late and I couldn't avoid that because some of you were coming in late and I didn't want to start until everyone was here. And I want to thank you before we get into the groups. You've been great, great questions, I appreciate it, not at all upset by that. And it's a much larger group than they told me. They told me seven. So I'm glad to see that a few more people decided that I might have something valuable to say. I hope you don't regret that. Anyway. Prevalence, 1 to 2 and a half percent worldwide. That's WHO says that's true. Present in all cultures at about the same rate. Affects males and females equally although males, onset is earlier. Symptoms vary but common themes. We've gone over those. The DSM criteria are specific. And you have to meet all five criteria. That is true also in the new DSM 5. Evidence suggests that behavioral therapies are the best, most effective, and a follow up is important because these symptoms wax and wane, so at a time when there's stress, they're more likely to fall back to previous behaviors and so a little bit of tuneup. You know, you're, you take your car in and get it fixed and it runs fine and a thousand miles down the road a spark plug's not firing right so you get it tuned up. You go into your physician periodically just to make sure you're okay and everything's fine. They do new blood levels and whatever they do. And we all see that as normal. We don't see it as normal as coming back to a counselor just to touch base and see how we're doing. It should be. And so I recommend that for all disciplines whether you're using CBT or something else that we just have periodic follow ups and it might be just a ten minute phone call. How you doing? It might be a half an hour appointment. How you doing? And so I try when in my practice at the university which, from which I've retired, but I would see students every couple weeks. You know, or they'd call, call in if they were too busy. I say let's, you know, let's set an appointment. And come back, it'll be half hour, you know set the appointment. If you don't need it, just call in and say I don't need it. But just call, 'cause you know someone else can use that time. And 99 percent of the time they either came or called, and a call is fine because I'd talk for a minute or two and say, you doing okay? Yea. They felt supported and that was all they needed. So I do recommend that. That follow up is really necessary. And then always leave the door open. If you have a problem between now and that next appointment, call me, but if you can wait, that's good. If you can't call me. Yes? Another question. 

01:12:35
UNKNOWN Sorry, just very briefly. With regards to support for the people who live with those people, is there a lot of information out there for them as well. 

01:12:45
BARRY JACKSON Define a lot. I would say not a lot. The group work is good if you bring the family in. A lot of families don't want to be involved. They're embarrassed. They want to minimize, oh no, it's okay, it's okay. No it's not okay. And sometimes that's because somebody else in the family does the same things so they're in denial. They don't want to admit to it. So there's not a lot of literature that I'm aware of. And my population was college students, so I wasn't working with families 'cause usually the student is from elsewhere and it's not convenient for the families, but I did a lot of group work with them, bringing in, you know, four or five of them that had the same problems. I did that with eating disorders as well and those kinds of things. It was helpful to sort of normalize not the behavior but themselves. And I would always point that out. We're not saying that this is normal behavior. We're saying you're normal with a behavior that's not beneficial to you. You know it's no different than saying you have heart disease, well now you're suddenly not normal? No, you're a normal person with a heart problem. Okay. Let's get to the, the case studies and here's the rules. I'm going to give you a case. And give you about seven minutes. There are four cases, four tables, that works out well. And I want you to go through it quickly using the criteria, the DSM criteria, and decide what they have, if anything. Okay. And I will flip back to the slide with the criteria. And get one person who's going to be the spokesperson, write something briefly as to what you think that is, and get on with it. Okay, and then you're going to stand up and give us about 30 seconds about what it is and why you think it is and I'll give you what clinicians have told me. Okay, thanks.

Before you continue watching this video, please download and read the "Case Studies" handout. 

01:15:00
BARRY JACKSON If everyone's ready, who would like to go first? I won't go by the case number. Who wants to go first? Don't everyone volunteer at once. Okay, we have, we have a candidate. Now what I'd like you to do for filming purposes is to stand up, come up here, well, it can be him, we don't, we don't, no, oh, we pulled the boss card out here. Okay, boss, come on up here. Come up here. Right next to me, pretend you like me. I don't bite, not hard. And you're going to speak to the camera and you're going to explain first of all, they don't know you're case. You have to tell them the case and then tell them what you decided and why. 

01:15:50
UNKNOWN Our case is Sarah, she's a 36 year old, single, never married, woman. She lives with her 76 year old mother. She's the fourth child and only daughter. Her father is recently deceased. The family has no financial concerns. Sarah has an advanced degree in nursing and an excellent supervisory position in a nearby hospital. She's well respected at work for her abilities. Sarah has never seen a therapist before. Sarah presents with concerns about her mother's health. Her mother has advanced arthritis and difficulty walking. She's alone during the day while Sarah works. Lately Sarah has been worrying constantly about her mother. She finds herself preoccupied at work and repeatedly telephones her mother to check and recheck on her safety. Her anxiety is having a negative effect on her job performance. She's forgetful and then ruminates on the possibility of making an error that injures a patient. As a supervisor, she has little patient contact. She finds herself continually rearranging her office desk and feels out of control when items are misplaced. Sarah is annoyed when she's interrupted while working. She knows these behaviors are excessive and that worries her more. These symptoms have never been present in Sarah's behavior in the past. Okay, can I just say that our program, we actually work with carers, so I'm hoping I'm speaking on behalf of everyone here 'cause these are my notes, these are the issues that we identified. Firstly, she could meet a lot of the DSM categories. However when you consider that her father is recently deceased, so she's now taking on a caring role for her mom, who has obviously a medical condition, she has not had any history of these behaviors in the past, she has an excellent at reputation at work and is well- respected. She's presenting with some concerns about her mother's health which under the circumstances of her father death, I think there's some trauma, some grief and loss, some stress and anxiety, and so the only query we had was around the feelings of out of control when she's rearranging her office desk. However, that again can also be a stress response because of all that she's going through at the moment. So we don't believe she has a diagnosis of OCD. 

01:18:30
BARRY JACKSON And what do you think her diagnostic category would be? 

01:18:35
UNKNOWN Well, why don't I ask my team? Well, I'm thinking she's, she's definitely got stress and anxiety. 

01:18:45
BARRY JACKSON Okay, yes, it's an anxiety disorder. It's treatable, very good, thank you. Who would like to go next? 

01:19:00
[sil.] 

01:19:05
BARRY JACKSON Well, don't everyone charge at one time. Here we go. I ask you to, if you can stand in front of your group and then that way all these wonderful colleagues can be on tv too. 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN Hi. I'll just read the case. 

01:19:20
BARRY JACKSON Hold it up close to your face. 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN Hank is enrolled in his first year of university. He is majoring in psychology. He has always had an interest in the discipline and thinks studying psychology will help him with his shyness. He has from earliest memory collected odd things. He checks on his collection several times daily to ensure that nothing has gone missing. Until moving onto the campus, his concern about losing an item in his collection seemed unreasonable, even to him. Now that he has a roommate who he does not know well and who finds Hank's collecting odd, he thinks his fears may be justified. He finds himself checking and rechecking the collection. He worries about what will happen if something is lost. He will repeatedly take out the items and count them several times before carefully replacing them, only to repeat the process. Before entering the university, he would perform this activity nightly. At the university, he is unable to do this nightly without detection and thus finds he cannot sleep. In order to protect the collection he has devised a series of traps to alert him to the disturbance of his collection by others. He organizes his desk and chair in a manner that will betray an intruder curious about his collection. He is suspicious of his roommate and the roommate's friends who visit their rooms. He tries to socialize with the roommate and his friends by drinking with them in the rooms but seldom leaves the quarters except for class or library work. I haven't got the diagnostic terminology here but we all came to agreement that it was the obsessive compulsive and relation disorders and the reason we differentiated between the, it's the behavioral one not the personality disorder. 

01:21:25
BARRY JACKSON Are you saying it's a personality disorder or a behavioral disorder? 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN No, we thought it was a behavioral disorder because it's something that he first initially enjoyed doing and now he doesn't enjoy doing. It's causing him distress and it's changing his daily life passion because he can't sleep and he's constantly thinking about it. He, it's, we think that it's, there's also another disorder in there as well because of the paranoia with the people. I mean, we reali-, we all discussed that it, that he has a concern with the safety issue of his objects so that's another symptom as well. 

01:22:15
BARRY JACKSON Okay, can you, can you differentiate for me the compulsion vs. obsession in this case? 

01:22:30
UNKNOWN Um... 

01:22:35
BARRY JACKSON How many other people here agree with that diagnosis? How many disagree? Yea, I, yes? 

01:22:50
UNKNOWN Maybe it's more of a compulsive disorder? 

01:22:55
BARRY JACKSON Yea, it's a personality disorder because it meets those criteria and part of it is the aspect of, thank you very much, the aspect of paranoia, concerned about other people. You don't really see a compulsion here, it's an obsession about his possessions that we see as paramount. It's not the compulsion. And that goes to the earlier question that Dave had an hour ago about how to differentiate the two. And sometimes it's tricky. There's no doubt. You're right that it started early, you know, even as a child, but again he was suspicious of other people. That's the key. He was suspicious of other people, that they were going to steal his stuff or something. That's his concern. Okay, but that's, you raised some very good points and I ask the next two groups, I know it's unfair, but I'm going to ask for you to move through quickly because we're, we are over time. Come one up and smile at the camera. 

01:24:00
UNKNOWN Okay, we've got John, 29, computer programmer, neat, orderly, works from home, changes items on his bureau several times getting the exact position, clothes are arranged in terms of color and use, like the closet's done pretty much the same. Once a week, washes his clothes and irons them immediately afterwards. Upset if routine is not maintained. Two long terms relationships. One where they co-habitated and she had no issue and actually found it quite attractive that he had these behaviors. Strict routines even as a child, self-disciplined which was also valued by the family. Periodically he does have recurring thoughts about what might happen if he varied the routines and these thoughts constantly, oh sorry, these thoughts occur when he can least afford to during heavy workload and short deadlines so obviously in relation to stress. We felt there was, had no significant issues and was a non-diagnosis, yea, didn't diagnose this as OCD. Obviously didn't affect him, there was no significance to it, there wasn't the hour and he had no concept of any problem. 

01:25:15
BARRY JACKSON And I have to point out that when I give this to the group, the gentlemen here said, boy it sounds like me. So he has to be normal. 

01:25:25
UNKNOWN The closet was identical. Thank you. 

01:25:25
BARRY JACKSON The closet was identical and he's normal. Yea, there's obvious, it's a trick question because there's obvious issues in there that you say whoa, you know, he's OCD, but it's really not interfering with his life. That's a key element. It's really not interfering with his life. It may in fact be helping his life because he's so orderly. It must be true, yes. Next. Thank you very much. So the diagnosis is no diagnosis, he's normal so to speak. Why don't you go back to your group. 

01:26:00
UNKNOWN Back here, so, oh, now Irene is an attractive woman of forty. We've decided that's all she needs. She's tall, very slender, beautiful long auburn hair, she's obviously invested in her appearance. In clothes, she's a stay at home mother of two children, she has a master's degree in sociology and worked prior to marriage as a social worker. Irene does structured physical exercise twice daily, watches what she eats and drinks. Although not into health food, she does know a great deal about nutrition. At a recent annual medical examination, she acknowledged that her menstrual cycle had become very irregular and the flow was sometimes minimal. Irene thinks about food and exercise frequently on a daily basis. She carefully records her caloric intake and sometimes fluids. She worries incessantly about what her husband thinks of her figure and general appearance. She fears she will leave her, he will leave her unless she maintains, remains thin. Even though he reassures her constantly of her constantly of his devotion and love, she remains fearful. She has developed extensive routines for putting on her makeup, arranging her hair and dressing. She feels out of sorts if this routine is disrupted and will begin the process over again. This often causes her to neglect her children until she is finished. She checks and rechecks her hair and makeup in the mirror and takes corrective action wherever necessary even while exercising, and even while exercising, she looks perfect. After her second child, she exercised nearly every day while her husband was at work and restricting herself to eating only when he was around. Everybody complimented her on her recovery of her lovely shape. Irene has always been insecure about men despite the reality of her obvious attractiveness and popularity in school. She knows all of this is unreasonable but cannot prevent herself focusing on these thoughts and her image of getting fat and unattractive. She worries about what would happen if her husband did not love her. Her routine quiets her distress. So we have a consensus of the fact that she's suffering from most everything. But we have a, but there's a, there's a disparity of, of thoughts about what it is which I think probably expresses the fact that she actually is a complex, a complex issue. She's expressing obsessive compulsive behaviors in that she will continue a process, so this compulsive thing where if it doesn't continue she will start to complete it until it's done and she will even neglect important aspects of her life that she'll do in order to conduct that behavior. But this behavior is done to relieve a distress, which is actually to do with her relationship, her sense of relationship. So one thing I didn't mention that I suggested there were some attachment issues going on here, and we also had suggested in the group, part of the group is leaning more towards personality compulsive disorder but that's because of the obsessive thoughts about her perfectness and so on and so forth. So the possibly, we might run down as I'm just thinking about it that it really is her thought of personality compulsive disorder which has then manifested in a compulsive, expressive behavioral disorder, which has all generated out of a previous issue which is to do with her relationships or her sense of acceptedness which may be attachment which might be early trauma which may be you'd be triggered on sexual stuff. And the eating disorder, well that's all in the personality disorder, so she's a complex issue. 

01:29:35
BARRY JACKSON Thank you. Oh, okay, yes, and let me repeat that. Hang on one second, Did anybody have a comment, we have one comment. 

01:29:55
UNKNOWN My comment is sorry guys, I'll be quick. I'm leaning more towards obsessive compulsive personality disorder because I'm not seeing the compulsion. 

01:30:05
UNKNOWN Oh we said that was in there. If you have to make a choice, and this is where it gets difficult, if we have to decide okay, we're running by the book, so when you going to call it that, well I would suggest she's got obsessive compulsive personality, yea. In that it has expanded into a compulsive disorder because she has a behavioral pattern as well but she also has attachment issues, she also has potential post traumatic stress disorder. And that leads us to that interesting thing, do we look in spectrums or do we look in categories, so it's true. That's a really good point to bring up, you know, which is the best way to approach the client. 

01:30:45
BARRY JACKSON Right. What things did you rule out? What, you know, you sound like you included everything and that normally isn't the way it works. You've got to rule some things out. 

01:30:55
UNKNOWN Yes, I know, it's a different, it's a different format. My colleagues ruled out most things, but my colleagues stressed looking at the personality profile. I actually think that ruling out things is an error of diagnostic approach and that syndromes are more the process that's going on. But then that's, so I perhaps impose that on the group so 

01:31:20
BARRY JACKSON Yea, it sounds that way. But that's okay, you're just a dominant male, what can I say. You should note that there are three women in his group. Actually the issues you had said it, and I don't know our name I apologize, the primary diagnosis is eating disorder. The secondary, secondary diagnosis is body dismorphic disorder. That she doesn't feel good about her body but and she's controlling it by eating disorders and there's a lot of overlap with OCD, there's no doubt about it, but it is a different diagnostic category. And when you get into the attachment disorders and all that, now you're really being psychoanalytic and DSM 5 would love you. So again, I want to thank all of you. You did a great job, you've been wonderful, you've been great to me, I'm glad you were so engaged and I thank you. Enjoy the rest of your conference and good night.
