RICHARD HILL I've got a wonderful story. Alan is one -- where he was -- she liked the Opal. So as he was looking at a whole bunch of diamond rings and the sole one with just a blue stone and said, oh, I don't like diamonds. And proposed immediately, it was excellent. The -- okay, so we're a lovely gathering today, thank you so much for being here. And what -- I keep trying to think of how to make the title sexy and interesting and that just has the word brain and gene and it just gets rather dull. But everybody is here, so it's a really fascinating thing. We're making some effort to get some chairs, so hopefully everyone will have a seat before too long. Hopefully, all our hot air will -- including mine will warm the room up a little bit if we won’t freeze to death, if you are freezing to death, then bad luck. As the little polar bear said to his parents, you know am I a polar bear, and to his grandmother am I a polar bear, and to his cousins am I a polar bear. Finally he got to his grandfather and said am I a polar bear, and he said, son, what is the trouble. He said, I'm freezing. The essence of where we are though is, I want to get into the subject now. Brain to body, to gene, to behavior, to gene to brain to body, behavior, it's all a flow of activity, it all happens. I’ll just quickly as Suzie, are they taking some, it looks like the hotel is doing something with hot seats, good. For all of you who have seats, just snick up. I went to -- the basic, text and theory behind how the whole world is driving us crazy was already intuitively in my head and in notes. When I went to see a lecture by Dan Siegeland Lou Cozolino, in 2005 on the brain and I just sat there and said, oh my God, what I'm saying is reliable and reasonably true and actually now 10 years later, after lots of work and we published it a few years ago. It's actually more reliable than I thought it was. So I think the sense that as we work and we say, I intuitively feel this is good, this is not an unreasonable comment. So that book and a lot of the work I do and things I'm now doing, and just -- and I'm validating and I am able to strengthen and say with some authority because of research. Actually I've had and my mother said to me when I finally wrote the book and she finished editing it, I had a good literary family. She said, I have a letter you wrote when you were 25, working on a cruise ship, which has this idea in it. And she pulled it out and she showed it to me and I thought, oh my God, you know. So it is important, we are talking about the thing that is important, this, this, it's expression and it's experience. And one of the things I do in my workshop is I do all the theories around the board and say, who practices which who does what but what's missing. And everyone goes, oh, this theory, and that theory, and this idea, you missed that one. And I draw a little stick figure because I'm not that artistic in the middle. And I said, that's what's missing, because that's what's in the center of it. So hopefully by the time we get to the end of our little chat today, I've explained about it, but I've also given some insight to it and given some practical applications that we can have for it and the it is this. So behavior to brain to gene and back again. We have just set through an hour of magnificent discussion about the brain, about stress and what an excellent support act. Now, what an excellent opening to what I want to do. So let me just simply do it this way. And the brain, certainly we did and we do this. It's this incredibly blobby sort of thing hanging around inside here a couple of -- two or three pounds of stuff, very small percentage of our body, takes up about 20% of our energy. Anybody know, we should know by now, I mean, it's getting quite common, how many neurons we have in the brain. 

00:04:35
 Lots. 

00:04:40
RICHARD HILL Lots is excellent. 

00:04:40
 10 million. 

00:04:40
RICHARD HILL 10 million, fantastic, it's going well. Actually it's 100 billion, 100 billion. Although interestingly, if you try -- if you do a search of the literature to find the piece of paper that says it's 100 billion, it's very, very hard to find. So it's kind of a bit of a main, but it's reasonably true. I do feel sorry for the person who was counting them, because you have to say 6 billion for -- one, two, you know, which is a bit of a setback. But 100 billion neurons, cool. But there's a bunch of connections with them. There's actually only about maybe 30 or 40 billion in the cortex, a lot of it’s in the back area or in the cerebellum, if anybody sort of says that to you, there's not really 100 billion, there's only just say don't be smarty-pants. Ah so it's divided around the brain, some have a lot of connections, some don't. Some maybe roughly 10,000 to 20,000 average connections throughout the brain, so that's 100 billion times that’s what’s about a quadrillion connections, actually I prepared that some earlier. The – the other thing is, we also have other cells in the brain, which are broadly called glial cells, but they are the cells that look after the neurons, there's astrocytes with the graft or the health of the brain, we've got microglia, which do other things and various. And then there's about a trillion of those, so it's a lot of stuff up there, it's busy as we'll get out, full of neurotransmitters that are flying around, making things happen and not making things happen. But the really important thing to know about the brain is about 30% to 40% of the neurons are related to sensory perception and sensory information. The rest, the other 60% to 70% are concerned with the process and the duty of associating and interconnecting all those sensory perceptions into a coherent and cogent perception and experience of life. How do we do that, how does that work, that is actually called the big question. So consequently, we don't know. But that is what we're trying to figure out. How actually the firing of neurons in a skull, electronic communication creates the experience of consciousness. Well, we don't know, but let me see, does anybody want to volunteer that we don't experience consciousness? Thank you very much. The philosopher is there in the front row, that's very good. 

00:07:15
 That's the other way around, consciousness creates the brain. 

00:07:20
RICHARD HILL That's right. We have all that wonderful stuff and then we move into the beautiful stuff of philosophy and are we there, are we not, and so on and so forth. But thank you for putting your hand up, I love it. Can everyone hear at the back, and all those who can't hear me, put the hand up, you know. The essence of what we need to do is, look at the nature and of the way in which we can help the brain integrate. What happens is these parts of these elements disintegrate and they become dis -- they become unable to connect to create a coherent picture, some become overexcited, as we were hearing with Allen and Mary talking about the amygdala gets over-active, then we become over-emphasized towards scared and mad and sad. If the frontal cortex becomes –or , some aspects of the areas of the frontal cortex become over-activated, then what we do is we have other issues. If we have areas in the basal ganglia, we have problems with OCD, if we have areas -- and so on and so forth. So interpersonal neurobiology, which is the principal area I work in the neurobiology side with it, on the Dan Siegel work and various other Allan Schore, so on and so forth. It's looking for the way we can integrate. But sometimes you have to differentiate, you have to figure out what the elements are before you can understand how to bring them more back together again.

Figure AB-16: Limbic System 

00:08:40
RICHARD HILL This is just a nice little cut-away and we've seen a bit of this and there's no need to go through it, we've seen some of these things. There is your hypothalamus and your pituitary, which link up with the -- that's the part of the brain that works up at hypothalamus, pituitary, down to the adrenals, for your stress, and you've got basal ganglia and the caudate. The main thing I want to show you in this diagram is that if you actually get inside a brain, unfortunately it's not cut like that, which is really annoying. So – so I must admit the first time I saw a vet lab, a video of a vet lab, I've -- I come from the school. And so I did it with, like that. And the second one I did it with one eye open and then the third one like that, and then the fourth one like that. And then I got oh wow. So I'm into it now. But I did have difficulty when they were --, please don't have the sound effects. But the brain is made up of a whole bunch of areas, which we don't need to go on, we've had some lovely indications from early on this morning. But they all do different things, that's relevant to understand that there are parts of the brain that do different things, there are parts of the body that do different things, why? Do you ever ask that? What is my stomach, bare stomach? Interesting. And the point of that is when do we -- what do we assume, what do we take for granted, and you know the things you take for granted, the things you don't know you take for granted, because you're taking them for granted. Just when I thought I was beginning to get a grip on neuroscience, Ernest Rossi came along and said, do you ever thought about what happens in the genes. And I got interested, and why they tied me, but this is so interesting. And as Alan was saying, in the last four or five years, we've had a rise in understanding the thing called epigenetics, which we'll try now and explain over the next, not too much, but I'm just going to try and work through this a bit in the next 10 minutes. So we get an understanding of where we are and what this might mean. The gene is an extraordinarily simple, but highly complex thing. It's just got four letters, what a very, very cleverlittle system. It has four letters who arrange themselves in a very specific way, and in fact only two letters will talk to each other, two pairs of letters will talk to each other. And we have the G, the C, the guanine, the cytosine, the inosine, adenosine and the thiamine. And the G connects with the C, and the A connects with the T. And they do this in pairs all the way along and they create in their pattern of connection a thing we call genes. And these genes when interpreted through the various mechanisms which again took me a year, so I ain't going to do it in 5 minutes. But in the -- the pattern is reproduced. They then are able to produce the chemical, the proteins that enable us to be a biological entity. And not only to be a biological entity, but to be a reproducible biological entity which is the important thing. A rock is not a biological entity in sort of technical definition because it doesn't actually have the capacity to reproduce this, so if doesn’t have DNA, that doesn't and are you going to say yes, that isn’t a living thing not we. We can move into that discussion there if I leap and fall of the stage just help me out. But the thing is this 302 billion of these base pairs you know, there is so many of the damn things that we have to divide it up into 23 pairs of chromosomes to sort of be able to manage it. And you may have several thousand, several tens of thousands of these base pairs creating a single gene. Here's the thing that is just kind of spooky beyond all get out. Here we are, look at this, hundred billion neurons in the head, trillion cells in the body, trillion glial cells going on in there, then we have got various other bits and pieces, forms of organs, differentiation of everything going on. We must have a just a hell of a lot of genes in there, we must have a vizbang(ph) load, I mean there are 302 billion base pairs, good heaven, there must be billions of them. They don’t do this. So we sort of examined things to try and find out how to look in to genes and one of the things that we practiced on a lot was the little worm, little 2 or 3 inch sort of fairly clear nematode called the Caenorhabditis elegans, which you know you are into genetics when you can say that without looking at it. But the Caenorhabditis elegans is where we have been looking at what is going on, they have about 302 cells, it’s very easy, the they have got 23 about 20 to 23,000 genes and these genes are very specific. So, if something, if something happens, we go the wrong way, you could go and have a look at the gene and find out which gene and which of these nucleotides are failing or in an era, which is very handy.So what we can do to body, we went down to look at the protein coating genes in our DNA and look for how many there are.We started thinking oh there must be 60, 70, 80, 100,000, 120,000 was the first guess, it went down. The most recent count is around 20to 23,000. Boo, same number of genes as it takes to make a little 3 inch clear nematodework. Moo, how interesting. So, we actually don't use genes to create our system. Specifically, we use our genes to insight and generate our system, we also use combinations, we also use changes of the way in which the genes are expressing, there is a whole bunch of other technical stuff. But in principle, we use the genes to build ourselves rather than being built by the genes. And that was the first thing and epigenetics came after that.So as Alan was saying this morning, we don't, we are not dependent upon our genes, our genes aren’ta fixed nature of our biological expression. They are a fixed nature of the potential for our biological expression and even then it's not fixed. So, this is just a nice little -- a nice little diagram and all these proteins and things they look like things that wouldn't save a dog on a wet day, but they will keep you alive. So, clearly I also believe that when you cut yourself up,neither are they, red and green and blue, so it looks better in the pictures. So what we do with genes is very simple. We, it's really simple, here we have a section of gene this guy here called the RNA polymerase is the dude that links on at a particular point for those that are sort of thinking a little bit about it at the promoter point was called the Tata area. And it links on and splits the gene because the genes aren't held together by glue, they are held together by an electronic attraction, it’s held together by a hydrogen ionic charge, so it’s this when we get in there I don’t want to go too far in there its really fascinating but it’s actually kind of scary, everything is just held together by ionic charges and things that it’s almost not there. And in fact what we talk about in the body when she get down into this area, we started get down into the area of just information. We’re almost, when we’re getting into quantum type thinking. But we're not quite small enough for quantum yet. Oh, no, thank you so Alan. Yes.It goes crazy. The -- it divides it and it also it sucks up information from out in the cell nucleus. Sucks it up and pairs up, the bits and pieces along the way. For those of you who see a u this was God just trying to keep us on our toes because it replaces the the uracil – it replaces the thymine with uracil. So the T with a U when it goes into RNA. But let's not go, this is too complicated. I’ll just put that there, I’ll leave that to show you it’s very complicated. And that's why I say let's anybody wanted to do a workshop on this later on it takes a bit of time. It goes through, breaks it down as this, this path comes away as what's called Messenger RNA, the DNA leans itself back up again and it's ready for use next time. Isn't that amazing? And I have actually, there’s a bit of footage on, on YouTube where you can see a hemoglobin protein being produced in real-time, takes that 15, 20 seconds and we make, I don't know, about 30 million of those every minute. It's a busy place, the nucleus of the cell, but what happens is this doesn't restrict itself to the same expression all the time. There are lots of factors, there were lot of factors that change it. And let's, let's put it a way that, that maybe makes it quite clear. There is my genetic code; there is my basic Gs, Cs, Ts and As. Depending on the way, that I bring these together as a protein by various forms of punctuation. I can get this.

A woman, without her man, is nothing 

00:19:25
A woman: without her, man is nothing 

00:19:25
RICHARD HILL  A woman without her man is nothing or I can alter the punctuation, I may get A woman: without her, man is nothing.

00:19:45
RICHARD HILL How I'm Libran very even handed, but this is almost as dramatic as can happen in the body, in the genetic process. We have and I was trying to get an example of this and there are a bunch of examples but they are fairly complicated. And literally I was sitting down having a cup of coffee while I waiting for Sue, we had meeting with somebody and I was having a cup of coffee and I was reading Scientific American Mind, and there in the back of Scientific American Mind was a discussion of a lovely gene which is a called amongst the ones that uses is called the chrm 2 but it's chrm 2.But it's a particular gene that has a slight change in it, depending on the individual and the difference between these -- what's called the polymorphism, but the a different expression of the gene in different individuals is those with the, this version of chrm2 can end up being really, really difficult teenagers, really, really difficult, poor resilience and difficult to go along. There's ones on the other hand seem they would be able to cope with, with life on a very wide scope of as of dealings.They are going to deal with it in a very wide way.In fact these are called orchid children and these are called dandelion children, dandelion we can cope with anything bit of a weed, we’re fine.Orchid very sensitive and tender. Okay, let’s just put that aside, now we'll go over to this one.Take chrm2 and put it back in its early life experience, it has problematic appearance, drug addicts, alcoholics, crises or whatever, very difficult environment, low social environment with a lot of danger, lot of stress, put a lot of stress alter the quarters all levels in the system as Alan was talking to us about this morning occurs with stress. And this chrm2can alter its expression in this way so much so that one of them is difficult, problematical, terrible, IDD-sh, you know, stick them in a cell most likely to do drugs alcohol, problem, problem, problem.This one, the stalwarts of thatcommunity, those that can give and give, and give, and share, and have the greatest open hearts that you’ve ever seen. Different expression due to the environment at that time because the environment at that time creates the biochemical milieu which becomes the tenor, becomes the tone of gene expression in that moment. This is one of the ways in which we change the physical experience through the biological tone, it'smilieu. And this is what we call epigenetic, I’ll just do this very quickly because I think what I have just said then should give you pause for thought for a minute or 50. The DNA, the purple stuff in order to be able to squeeze it into the cell because it’s actually about a meter long in some circumstances and you get there into what time is the cell, what is going on here. We have a little Dudley Deck called the HISDA(ph) that forces – there’s eight of them. It’s just isn’t again all just little chemicals, all just little energies and they gather together and the DNA rolls itself around it, there’s a couple of rolls around it and that enables this to have so you've got the DNA helix rolling itself around twice, around these and then they squish themselves up. And what you can do is these little histones have a tail which goes off and you can actually add chemicals to that tail for those that are just into half the age at this stage, right. You can do a variety of different types of alterations, it's an epigenetic factor, on the histone tails.Interestingly, you can also do a chemical factor or directly on the DNA itself and it causes a gene to be quietened, what's called silenced it and when you remove those particular chemical restrictions it makes it able to be, able to speak, able to, to be listened to. And this is very, very important because in differentiation, what happens is your cells move, some cells become livers, some cells becomes stomach, some cells become brain and a fairly large percentage of the cell is actually to do with its differentiated space. So, how do you turn of brain genes and muscle genes and stomach genes and kidney genes in a liver cell. Well, these are the mechanisms this, this epigenetic mechanism is used, so that's the good sense of it. What it's actually, what we’ve actually found now as humans become more and more complex in their social arrangements in their social engagements,is that we can actually add these epigenetic markets in order to enable us to manage our expected social environment. So if you have a difficult troublesome dangerous social environment, you're going to epigenetically reorganize various cells around your body to be able to produce something that will enable you to cope with a dangerous, difficult, stressful environment. So you are going to become hypersensitive, you're going to become very watchful around your community, you're going to become perhaps a little bit more serious, not so much -- so playful. Because that could make you, put you dangerous, become hyper vigilant. And that's a good thing, sort of. We are actually and I listened to a conversation, I don't want to go on too much because it's so important. But this little conversation on the television, yesterday between a bunch of young people, couple of journalists so little conversation. They are saying what is it that is going on in Australia at the moment? And these were lot of expats. Now come and say, why are you all so stressed, and tensed, and upset, and worried, what are you on a batch are the most everything in the world says you have got the most money, you’ve got the most jobs, you’ve got the most thing, what is going on, just relax and have a good time for God sake. But we're not. And just a quick social comment, I can't resist it either way. What type of person is more susceptible to influence? Someone who is comfortable, relaxed, cool, centered in themselves, enjoying their experience or someone who is concerned, wide, fearful, hyper vigilant and looking for the thing that is -- don't worry vote for me, I'll make your life much better. But that's not what we say. Don't vote for them, they will ruin your life and you will die. And I, I don't even have to be political everyone says that. But these things actually go down to add genes right themselves in our gens and make us who we are. Okay, we are going to go expand on that, find out how that all happens. So here is just to give you an idea.

00:27:25
RICHARD HILL Gene expression and Epigenetic silencing, just quick summary of what we’re saying. We have state dependent gene expression, so we want liver cells to be liver cells to be liver cells to be liver cells as they reproduce. We have activity dependent gene expression, so we have genes that express themselves in relation to the experience we're having at this moment of time in order to best survive this experience. We have epigenetic markings which enable us to remember the sorts of things that we needed to do now, so that when that situation occurs, again, assuming that it’s going to continue that we would be ready for it, so we don't have to figure it out every time. Imagine if we had to figure out that, that was going to give you a slap over the back of our head when he came home pissed. Every time it happened, you'd be dead. So of course you buildup hyper vigilance and protectiveness and you buildup various cut-offs of your emotions and you buildup alexithymia, and you build up schizophrenia and you do all kinds things to protect yourself, dissociative behaviors and so on and so forth. And a lot of this is done just through ionic energy by making things tight, by making things loose. And we can actually work on these metaphors in our experience, the metaphors that we use at human behavior, we can actually apply them all the way down to the genes when it's done in an annoying fashion and that's unfortunately not here, but in the workshop we will do that . And when you all come to that. So let's take it down simpler one more step. 

00:28:55
Becoming human 

00:28:55
We construct ourselves 

00:28:55
From elemental materials 

00:28:55
Over time 

00:28:55
In response to experience 

00:28:55
RICHARD HILL We construct ourselves, from elemental materials of which the DNA is a vital part but not everything. Over time in response to experience. Whatever we’re doing as therapists we are going back to try and find the experience that cause them to construct themselves from their elements over time. Now the elements, this is where it also gets very interesting and why it really, it is hard Alan. I know I keep referring to you andit’s difficult because you've done it. But emotionally your talk this morning of neuroscience is the thing that will take counseling a step further. I can't under -- I can't – I can’t impress upon you in an hour what -- what was done for us this morning. So I want you to really think about it, grab his work and, don’t read and, listen to him more. That’s very important. Let’s simplify it again. DNA plus experience 

00:30:00
DNA+experience 

00:30:00
Biology+activity 

00:30:00
Behavior 

00:30:00
RICHARD HILL  creates a biology that is active and from that emerges a behavior, that enables us that is the expression of our brain. So there is three different versions of the same thing, all little bit simpler and depending upon the way your -- your particular mindset is and you might like all of them, but please just adapt so they have three things saying the same thing. Quickly I have to mention my dear and blessed mentor Ernie Rossi. When we talk about psychosocial genomics and fingers crossed I have a paper coming out in European Journal of Hypnotherapeutic Clinical Sciences next year on a definition of psychosocial genomics which Ernie made sure that I was given the 

00:30:55
Psychosocial Genomics 

00:30:55
The deep psychobiological 

00:30:55
process of "activity or 

00:30:55
experience-dependent gene 

00:30:55
expression and brain 

00:30:55
plasticity" associated with 

00:30:55
creativity and psychotherapy. 

00:30:55
RICHARD HILL  publishing the name right. But the deep psychobiological process of activity or experience-dependent, remember those things that we respond to as different from the state dependent, gene expression and brain plasticity associated with creativity and psychotherapy until all the way he pairs those two. So people say you're not a science because you're creative and I say I am a science because creativity is the only thing that alters the genes plus a four hour validation of that. Now I've got an activity for later I want to do it now I want to do it now because otherwise we’ll all be – we’ll all be benign. We need to take a pause, first of all I want everybody to a nice deep breath. I want you to think about all those new synaptic connections that you’re developing right at the moment. He said what I was there—I was that experience – or was that – that – I love the dog in the front here who just went -- so I don't care I got up. How does experience changes so rapidly, or better how easy is it for experience to changes? I have a little experiment. Ladies and gentlemen if you would just now help me out by taking all your money out and no sorry that was -- I thought it was Sunday in church. Now the -- if you could just close your eyes and if you would and I -- just to remind you that although the joke was a bit crass, laughter is a very, very good mechanism of clearing the left brain and shifting you a bit right brain. So as Susie sometimes says I know you were making a joke Richard but couldn't you have done another one. Okay I'm going to give you a stimulus; I simply want you to allow your body to respond to this stimulus. It’s a verbal stimulus, it’s very simple, more than come and smack you or anything while your eyes are closed. So here we go, here it comes no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no okay. We’ll take breath and come out. Just quickly shut out some of the feelings, some of the experiences that happened there. This is a bit like the blowing up in the row, what is some of things that happen? 

00:33:45
 Stiffening up 

00:33:45
RICHARD HILL  You felt the stiffening, yeah? 

00:33:50
 Tightness. 

00:33:50
RICHARD HILL Tightness. 

00:33:50
 Heaviness. 

00:33:50
RICHARD HILL  You feel the heaviness sorts of thing and yeah, don't move it’s like an auction. Yes? 

00:34:00
 Pulling back into yourself. 

00:34:00
RICHARD HILL You had a pulling back into yourself, that will do for the moment, that will do for the moment, be all you, down, pressing, stomach as we heard before we were talking about stress in bits and pieces. Okay, quick breath of clearing, we had laughter, thank you so much. Oh, just the -- there's an elephant in the room. Okay, second stimulus yes, yes, yes. yes, yes, yes, yes yes. Okay. I'll tell you I find it hard to keep saying yes in a very unemotional way the more I go into it, the more I want to actually say oh yeah. So some other thoughts? 

00:34:55
 (inaudible ) 

00:35:00
RICHARD HILL You felt the content and you actually put your, you actually put your, you actually put your hand in out your face lifted, yeah, expansion, did you have a thought – a verbal thought much lighter, yeah. 

00:35:15
 (inaudible ) 

00:35:17
RICHARD HILL Your brain opened up, yes you felt because the other one was like, it’s like the skull is crushing in on the organizing thing. And I'm doing that. Now, all I did was give you, the two things that are iconic representations of operation and openness and we just learn that over time so they are pretty effective ones. But, what if I gave you that no every day, what if I gave you that no 20 times a day, what if I gave you that no every time you turned on the news, every time you heard a radio program, every paper you picked up, every time you put in a school report, every time you kissed your partner, every time you whatever, kills you. And this guy here changes himself, herself, itself, this energy changes itself to protect you from being hurt. On the other hand yes call, yeah, and we all felt much better. You do that so what we do and actually this is what my book is kind of all about, it's looking at this aspect that we live in a no world what we call an externally evaluated world where our values are actually based on external yeses and nos and we actually judge ourselves accordingly. And the effect is that we bring people into our room and what do we create, a yes environment, that's what reports. The report is really just another way of saying a yes environment where people come and then you literally, they walk up the stairs or down the hall into your office. And you can see them going -- oh God, okay and they are shifting their chance at oh, God do I, and this and that and then I did, this and that, but is a, and we finished it and we say, excellent you feel so much better now yes I feel so much better, this is really good. I just say and that was on your in out there backing up. 

00:37:25
[sil.] 

00:37:30
RICHARD HILL I'll see you next week. But it is very difficult – it is very difficult and a lot of the people and lot of the work that is being done in people who are trying to change the number of people who come into our rooms are actually trying to change the way in which the world is full of no and try and create more yeses in the no or try and create a capacity to see the no into a greater tendency to see the yes and so on and so forth. Now this is all organized without us thinking about anything. you didn't do anything to come with those things, or feel those really negative critical comments, I mean, you said you didn't walk into this room, wanting to have a abusive thing in mind, but I give you a no, and you say, okay that. And a self-organizing system is what we need to understand is the way things go on. Self organizing systems kind of run themselves, but they don't run themselves in a sort of a non-organized way. A self-organizing system comes from chaos theory and complexity theory, and so on and so forth. But it's kind of the essence of -- when you see a flock of birds, that are flying over hundreds of thousands of birds, that just seem to be, it seems to be like an orchestra, that is going, someone's who is leading this? Who is getting them to go in these patterns and so on and so forth, fish as well, music I mean if I go da, da, da, da, da, da, daaa -- daaaa, how do you know that? How do you know that? I was actually going to do a sort of bit of melody, but I thought I get carried away. So, how do you know that? Isn't that fascinating? Isn't that one of the things you take for granted? That yeah I just do that, there is a whole bunch of things and this is actually how we can utilize and be effective as therapists. Within the difficulty of a self-organizing system and remember the whole idea of chaos and complexity, is it a very small impact that one point in the system can have a very unpredictable and unexpected result elsewhere. Hence those sort of statements like a butterfly flaps its wings in China, and there is a tornado in somewhere else. Equally you can have a tornado in China, and a butterfly flaps its wings somewhere else. So a self-organizing systems do however have some kind of formation and in principle, we have what's called the initial conditions. 

00:40:10
Self Organising Systems 

00:40:10
Initial Conditions- DNA, polymorphisms 

00:40:10
Organizing Principles 

00:40:10
RICHARD HILL  So, for example, a fish as a self-organizing system, it's a very different that that system organizes itself quite differently while it’s in a desert, than if it's in the water. So the initial conditions actually have a very important impact on the nature of initial of the self-organizing system. And DNA and its polymorphism that particular things is one of the foundation of initial conditions of our complex system. We also have organizing principles. Those birds in computer programs that have been done to try to simulate what it's all about. Keep your wing tip within a similar distance to the bird next to you, fly and respond within a very short space of time to a change in the bird that is next to you and why didn't that fly towards the middle. Those three organizing principles will enable 100,000 birds to form an orchestral wave of beauty and joy in the atmosphere, so unique. So what do we get, what are our organizing principles or some of them? We got a few more than just the three the bird needs, but this is particularly ones in relation to we're ongoing now. We have interactive responsive biochemicals. So we don't have biochemicals that are inert and irresponsive to others, I know just you know like if -- oil and water, they are not separate –they are -- they're interactive and responsive. They are responsive to experience, to experience so they will adapt. There's a hierarchy of response. The more it is likely to benefit you, and that could be pay attention to it if it’s a thing is going to kill you, pay attention to it if it's a thing that you might love, pay attention to it, if it's a thing that is giving you fun and joy and pleasure, depending on the circumstances. But there is a hierarchy of response depending on the circumstances. And here's the one which is absolutely vital. Responses are remembered, I alluded to that before. We are not a system, that just deals with something and out, deals with the next one and out, we deal with something, we learn, we remember, we then move on, we deal with the next thing and we may utilize that memory. So what happens here with human beings is that we change the initial conditions, regularly. So can therapy work? Yes. Can, as Alan said this morning, negative brain plasticity. Can trauma change us? Yes. Can we change it back? Yes. Will we keepreverting back to the damaging thing. Arguable, but in principle no. And here's the other one that human beings seems to have put onto it is meaning. Meaning, intention, purpose, those sorts of words which is very important emulation to mirror neurons we’ll talk about that. This is just another way of looking at self-organizing systems in the sense of the positive and negative adaptations.

00:43:40
RICHARD HILL So in the optimal side, our immune system is designed for us to be well, it organizes itself in a well way in the appropriate circumstances, we have a brain that will seek association. We have a body that prefers positive emotions. Dopamine makes you feel really good, excessive quarters all the things make you feel really bad, we don't like it necessarily, except if your in(inaudible ). Seeking -- we seek things we are interested, we are curious and we have a social brain, we have a social organism, we like to be with other people and when everything is going well, that is the way, we will orient ourselves but we are adaptive to the conditions we are in, so we will if necessary disintegrate our processes in order to be able to manage, if I can't manage my emotional reactions because my father used to or, my mother did things to me when bullies at school or whatever it is, then I will disintegrate, I will disassociate.My hierarchy of needs not Maslow(ph) but my hierarchy of needs will determine the survival so on and so forth. Habituation we get used to stuff and we forget that it's actually; we don't like it because we use it and again automation and normalization happens in our biology. So we will normalize negative behaviors, because it moves out of our conscious perceptions and into a -- it’s in our amygdala or it's in our basal ganglia, so we have automatic thoughts, we have all these preprogram stuff that is outside of immediate cognitive control. So that's again Alan, gave us the clue this morning, you must have ongoing work in order to sustain brain plasticity. So it's just another way of looking at that. So that was the yes no. So I just felt that we needed to do something, so I thought I’d bring it up a little bit.

00:45:45
RICHARD HILL Let's just have a quick look at how we remember, and I'll just pause for a moment here, this is just slightly different thing. How we're going, I'm trying to give a bit of clarity, a few different explanations. Are there any questions at this point that anyone would like for some clarity or just simply to slow me down. We're good at the moment. Okay. So remember I'm saying that what we do, one of our organizing principles is that we remember stuff. And this is one of the ways in which we can manage to go into experiences that are similar to an experience we had before and produce a behavior that has some prior --prior engagement. Now we want to stick with all the nice things like we learned how to do it nicely, but these of course memories are also come out in awful behaviors prejudism, anyone, I don't know why I keep looking at everything, I'm just so interested, but I ended up in with these poor families -- the method is -- what are -- in America the ones that are anti, the anti the country they go to when soldiers are killed, they go to the funerals and picket them and say, you're horrible, you've avoid a Baptistyou've seen this sort of stuff and the little kids are sitting they are saying you're evil, you're bad and so on and so forth. So, memories aren't always great, that's why what is part of that therapy to reframe memories that are damaging. And just at this point in the philosophy, who said that good memories are the ones that we should have. Well, I think it's a moved argument, is your immune system better, do you love more, do you hurt less, do you get better sleep, do you have better sex, do you find more engagement and have more dopamine, well dumb question.But again one of the things we take for granted because sometimes we just say to our clients just go out and be happy and everything will be wonderful, but sometimes going out to be happy gets you slapped in the face, by people. So it's not about, it's not simple, it's not simple, it's you having a sense of strength and contentment where you can be happy regardless of what comes back at you, you're not evaluating yourself by what comes back at you. But we have -- because we have the implicit and explicit memory and who is familiar with these terms implicit and explicit memory, or who is unfamiliar, who is unfamiliar with these terms, there are few hands yeah, yeah. And this is one of the really important things and it's not difficult without going to the complexity of it, explicit memories are the memories that we are able to access in a conscious way usually in a verbal expression. Implicit memories are those memories that have embedded themselves and encoded themselves in other parts of our system, but we are not able to readily access them and a lot of things like imprinting, a lot of things like a trauma and so on and so forth go into our implicit memories. But we also have memories and our biochemicals as we've seen with the DNA and epigenetics. We have memories obviously in our new neuronal so in our brain because we create synaptic connections that activate that, but also in our noural through the body, the nervous system through the body, it will also, if you tap here, and you tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, they’re all Chinese water torture, you will actually over a period of time, as Mary was saying this morning, it's like having a brush on the same spot you don't have to do it hard, you will actually increase the number of neurons or nociceptors that are on that spot and you'll hypersensitize it. So that has a number and of course then we go through all kinds of areas in our biology, we know that the stomach actually has a neural net around it, which is called the enteric memory system, and it doesn't remember like the brain remembers, because people sort of say, yes your stomach has a memory, as if it's sort of down they're going, yes, that I'm getting now, I didn't like last time and so I'm going to get you. No it doesn't, but it does have its own – its own process of solving information, it gets information that cause the problem which it solves. We also have now found that we have the same sort of processes going around the heart, which is really kind of cool and interesting and again people kind of give the impression that you're brain and heart is talking to, you give me a break, but that doesn't mean that the heart emotional nerve system because it has quite a lot of serotonin going on in the process of serotonergic nerves there isn't interacting with the brain and inducing and creating those sorts of thoughts. Nothing is needs to be on its own, look all connected, that's what the Asian -- the lovely geography Asian acupuncture is to when the Australian guy came in and he had a headache, so I gave him a needle and the thing and he had a backache, you know in the kidney, so we gave him a needle and I said Jay is might, they gave me a needle from my head, and the foot, for my back -- wow and of course the very wise guy said that you’rea crazy lot, it's all connected, and it's true. And just to give you something, we're not going to talk extensively about this because it's too much, but this is the sort of stuff, I, the Sue that you met before as a body worker, she is a remedial massage therapist who is a nurse, she's just one of the first passes out with the Masters in lifestyle medicine, I now I have40 years of knowledge that I could never have picked up on my own and it's just really, it’s the sort of like England and France.

Mind-Body Memory 

00:52:05
Fascia Brain Muscles 

00:52:05
Skin Immune System Organs 

00:52:05
RICHARD HILL But we do have all this stuff going on in our brain, we're talking there about all the muscles. 40% of their body mass and we sit around in chair and let them atrophy and then wonder why something goes wrong. We are designed to move and they speak to us and they speak to the body and they interact and they cause genetic and epigenetic behaviors. We have our organs of course, what's that wonderful thing, someone's a bit crabby, well say, woo, you’re a but liverish today dear. Yeah, if your liver is not in the right state you're going to respond accordingly. The skin that's all over you,very responsive.The fascia is another thing that's actually a sheet of gelatinous tissue that occurs between the skin and the muscle tissue and it actually is a chaotic system of integrating fluids that provides 80% of your strength. So when you lean down and pick up something like so, if I take away your fascia all your muscles will just go berserk and fall apart. Absolutely extraordinary new stuff, I think we went to the first fascia conference when was that darling in only about – only about four, five years ago, first fascia conference and that was really lovely was at Harvard. So I bought a T-shirt. And people say have you been to Harvard, I told yes, two days. But anyway, it was really good and all these things connect to each other and this guy here I'm just introducing these ideas to you at this point, obviously we can't talk about this, the immune system, if you've ever heard the term microfascism, various other terms like that, but microfacies actually have receptors all around them for the neurotransmitters. So you have serotonin,serotonergic receptors and adrenergic receptors a bunch of really(ph) things and they also send information back to the brain from the immune system. Your immune system and your brain are directly connected biochemically. You get sick, your brain is unhappy, isn't that cool. How many depressed people are simply sick. Low level sicknesses, this chronic inflammatory stuff that's being talked about now that comes from diet and so on and so forth.

Temperament Personality 

00:54:35
RICHARD HILL So implicit expression though, okay his real take home point number one, other than the 40 things that we've had before, but this is new, in the sense it's my contribution to the discussion. Our implicit expression speaks to us all the time and it speaks to us we're very familiar with it speaking to us with our behavior, sure. We're very familiar with is speaking to us through our affect, our emotionality, our mood, our feelings and things. It also speaks to us through our personality and he is not himself at the moment. That's not a problem, that's a message. That's your body trying to tell you this bit is not working, this bit is doing this, I'm getting too much that, my liver is here, my kidneys are there, I'm getting too much indolucan(ph) six, indolucan two, is gone bad, my macrophages are going bananas, what's your serotonin doing and you're setting there because we don't know, we don't know what's going on. Temperament. Temperament is a wonderful expression Joseph Kigan, Joseph – Joseph – Joseph Kagan, all right K-A-G-A-N look at him, talk about temperament and so we have those people with us sort of sensitive type of the temperament and a not so sensitive type of temperament and then there is a bunch in between. But temperament is a there's been a big discussion between the Kagan and Siegel recently about the relationships of temperament and attachment theory. And Kagan sort of thinks well temperament is here and attachment theory is there and Dan is I think sort of temperament is cool, but attachment theory is cool too, so it's really interesting. In other words we are in the now of the discussion. We are not in the,oh come catch up everybody we’re in the now and the stuff that Adam was talking about earlier and I'm talking about now and in fact this stuff, you're the first people in the world to hear it, although it's around and about I mean I didn't rethink it about a nowhere, obviously lots of people are saying it, but I think they’re a gathering and this one is one that not many people are talking about all because they are not into chronic inflammatory diseases because that's really new.Sense of wellness, particularly low level pain, because when you're in pain your immune system talks to your brain and you slip into a thing called sickness behavior and sickness behavior is a very healthy social behavior, it tends to make you down in mood, it tends to make you want to go away from other people, and it tends to make you want to lie down and not do anything, what a really good idea, if you've caught a bacteria in the social, in your tribe. Your mood inclines you to not like other people and go away from them and then you lie down, really good idea. And this is wonderful for a two to three week, illness, so what do we do with the 30 year mortgage and the five year political freedom campaign. Okay. Second take-home.

00:57:40
RICHARD HILL There's actually 10 voices, the 10th one is just so bloody obvious it’s mood affect, it’s those things. These are the things that you can talk to, to find out how somebody is, beyond just the fact that maybe they're having trouble with their mother, -- when – as Freud told. You look at their skin, what is the color of their skin, what is the color? Is it grey? Is it tight, is it flaky, is it you know, how does it look. Ask him about the sleep, sleep is vital, Susie just finished a preliminary pilot study on the relationship between sleep and mild pain. There's been lots of studies with sleep and very bad pain, but we, and as a correlation between the two and she found in the small study we have to do something much better to verify it, but there was a similar reaction of more pain, less sleep, less sleep, more pain. They're very much tied in, and depression, there is a third paper there they are the triangle of trouble. Sun, how much sun are they getting. I can't go into Vitamin D today because it's a really important thing, but Vitamin D is one of the fundamental elements, the biochemical elements in the body that produces our immune system and our capacity to be immune. It goes through, it goes through the kidney, it goes through the liver, it changes about two or three times, it pairs up with a -- in the genetic area or in the cell with a thing called the CYP 450 family and it does stuff and if you don't have any of that, it really, really not good for you and can end up you sitting in a doctor's surgery feeling this or in a councilor psychotherapist surgery feeling moody so and so. Some can be the cure, because 80% of your Vitamin D is produced by ultraviolet rays on the skin and taking it dietarily is not necessarily the way you can do it. So that's important, so Sun is important. Sugar. We are designed to be attracted to sugar, why? Because there was never any bloody sugar. Someone found out that human beings were instinctively attracted to sugar, they also found out in a 1988, Melvin is that, I’m in and out Melvin told everybody that there was actually a syndrome, that people suffered, that where sugar actually could become addictive and could actually cause all kinds of other chronic inflammatory and perhaps even have issues with the diabetes and be dealing with this thing called diabetes too. And you would think that in 1988, if someone found out that taking excess refined sugar was actually going to cause people over a space of about ten or talks about -- takes about 10 or 15 years actually to take a healthy pancreas and make it diabetic of having this excessive sugar. Then what you would do is then we would actually move towards healthy foods and we would actually improve this is excellent, this is actually what would happen. And of course what would happened in 2005 around the middle of the 2000s, you would have all these healthy people rather than oh, that's right, what we did in 1988, I said oh, cool now I know what the hamburger bundle may people eat more and hell, we’re not going to have the diabetes to -- epidemic. In 2005, noone is going to worry about it then and it’s exactly what has happened. When I read Melvin’s paper from 1988, I wanted to punch something. I thought, they did it with smoking, now they are doing with it -- sugar. Sitting, activity, Alan, yeah, there is a beautiful activity there, stress, just one thing to add to what Mary was saying this morning, stress, that releases cortisol is a reaction to a stress of danger, a stress of concern. Stress can also and I actually use a different word for the stress that comes from challenge, where here's something, which is difficult for me, but I can do it. I'm not afraid of it, I’m not mad or sad about it, and I can actually move forward. And stress of danger releases the cortisols and the adrenalines and the things that get you and shut you down,and turn off your prefrontal cortex and so on and so forth. But the stress of challenge actually turns you on and it releases dopamine, and it releases a seracolin,(ph) and norepinephrine, it actually wakes up the prefrontal cortex and it's an exciting time. How come we incorporate that into our practices? Ha, ha, several slides ahead, I’ll tell you. Sex, libidois incredibly important and if you haven’t – if you haven’t figure out, you’ve got stress, if you can't, if you're saying to your client, you are having trouble with your stomach, you know you have trouble sleeping, you find that you're barking at people and then you are going and then you say how is your sex life? Oh, oh yeah, well now listen, because the stress system turns off your libido, if you're fighting the sabertooth tiger, you don’t want to think about having sex with the tiger, particularly, anything, you know it's the last thing you want to do, I mean this is what we do when we get into stress, we turn off the libido, we turn off the stomach, we turn off the planning process, as we don’t need to plan, you know he is in fire, oh, I'm going to – the tiger – oh when the tiger is over there, you just come on and you try and survive you act and store. This is why stress based learning, only teaches you what is beneficial for the stress. Challenge based learning teaches you, what has enabled you to expand. Pain, I mentioned that briefly before, and one of the others, so pain is an enormous mechanism. What do you do, what, what -- when you feel a pain, what’s the – what thought goes through your head? Oh sorry, just put your hand up, so I can grab some of that, yep. 

01:04:05
 Stop doing. 

01:04:05
RICHARD HILL Stop doing, what I’m doing. Something, yeah, stop doing, yeah. Do something. What a brilliant mechanism. All I have to do to interrupt whatever hell you think is a good idea is give you some pain and then you will stop doing, you have to figure out what it is, because sometimes we don’t know what it is? What sells like hot cakes out at the chemistsshop, analgesics, block, mask, cover up, don’t have soldier on, be good, it’s okay, keep the economy going, don’t -- I’m sorry, you don’t matter. And the last one is the face. Exactly when we had the yes thing, it came up this is, if you got to read just even porges polyvagal theory, it will incorporate some of the areas where that goes particularly, we actually when we're in a good move, when we're in a social engagement, we actually trigger through what's called the dorsal vagus complex, we actually trigger facial muscles, which lift our cheek bones, lift our face, lift our eyes, alter our vocal cord, so that they can have a synodic(ph) tone, enable our face and our shoulders to move slowly, our gesture, all these socially engaged things and here's the thing that will spook you out and will get out is that it tightens the stapedius muscle in the ear, which attenuates the ear for the frequencies of human speech. A danger comes along, we relax, we relax, we settle, we focus, we close in, we close down, that we let go of the stapedius muscle and we attune ourselves to the sound of grouse wrestling in the grass, lower dangerous sound. Stephen Porges is resolving not curing, very dramatic autistic problems because they are in this downstate by giving them and training their stapedius muscle to work harder and I watched a film of a guy after five sessions for the first time in his life at the age of 42, when his mother walked in the room go, hello, and look her in the eye and he had on the side of his eyes wrinkles because of all these muscles. Guess what we do with Botox we autisticate our face. Guess what we're finding in people who had Botox over a long period of time. They have difficulty being able to recognize facial expressions because they lose the motor capacity and the motor understanding and it’s related to the mirror neurons that we talk about, because mirror neurons in the, their main job in the empathetic process is to give you an understanding of the other person’s motor capacities in relation to your own. Really interesting, another 44 hours. Okay, where are we quarter past two. Activity two, let’s just run through a quick things. I want to show you how easy it is, with one particular thing. Now I -- Morgan you're my good friend, so if you would be so kind is just to walk across the front of the stage there, I want to just see if you can do that properly for me. Yeah, I just want you to walk -- I'll let you knows as you maybe I just want to see you’re doing it okay. Now, that's fantastic, that's great, take your seat, that's wonderful. I really appreciate the effort and I think you’ve made a fabulous effort and I really appreciate your work, but it's not quite right. Ma'am you –if you come across, if you could just you know, I just improve on that, I mean it’s okay. You're wonderful I really like that Morgan, but it's not quite it. If you would be so kind, as just –just – just -- that's very good yeah just want it. Now look at that, isn't that fabulous, isn't that wonderful, that's absolutely marvelous. So good, thank you so much if you just sit there. It's not quite – it’s not quite the way -- it's not quite right, but really, really close. Sir, would you mind just doing it once if you could do it for me. 

01:08:45
[sil.] 

01:08:50
RICHARD HILL Who is in charge of that walk? In 15 seconds, I owned you. I became an external evaluative control of your values and you bought it. Scary, it's that simple. Now, you chose to trust me which is fine. I could have been lying this whole time, I might have stolen one of Alan's papers and just be reciting this. Isn't that fascinating, this is what we're told, that's not quite right, that's not quite good enough, oh, you could do that a bit better and you see how I did the other thing which is this and all -- wonderful, oh, so good, oh, I love what you're doing, it's not quite what I want. I really appreciate what you're saying and I loved hearing what you're doing, but I don't think that it's quite rough kid, oh, you know, I mean go. So I spent a lot of time in America coping with people who tell me that I'm really fabulous and fine, but so this sort of external evaluation is everywhere and that's a no, and that’s a no. So then of course, what we would do it would be was I did this first at an incentives business place, a seminar. And I had a whole room full of people who sold incentives to get your employees to sacrifice their lives for you. And I did all that, and I got to about this one and I think if I asked the next person you probably would have said oh, it's a waste of time, because you just – okay. I know I said, okay I've been outside to the whole and I have a all expenses paid trip to Fiji, I have transfers, I have hotels, I have mails, I have everything, who wants to come up as long as you just walk across the floor, properly for me I'll do it and the one of them would get up, not one. And what happened to me after I had given my speech, not one of them came anywhere near me, because I was showing them that their stuff was bollocks or had a whole lot of problems in it. It was really interesting. So as you said, do you think that might have been a bit self-sacrificial that like. You haven't seemeda bit invited do any of their highly paid seminars.

TRUTH 

01:11:30
RICHARD HILL So what happens is here's another terminology. I think we’ve used this, but you might like this one are you might like to form something around this. So we embody what is our experience, and that experience is to ask true. When you have someone who has blocked off their relationship between their prefrontal cortex and their limbic system in order to cope with an abusive childhood and they actually don't have a good sense of their own emotions or perhaps they don't have a good sense of other people's emotions. That's a truth to them, and when you say to them all trying to get them or you’re a bit unemotional, you're a bit, give a,no, no, no look I'm angry. Well, you don't just see I'm angry now. I give the untrue truth and then well I give the truth as well. I'm not sure whether the truth is a good thing or the untrue truth is a good thing. All I know is that there are truths that make us feel better and there are truths that make us feel rotten.And so I call the truth that make us feel rotten untrue truth, and I have to, we or I and therefore you we have to wind our way around. They are arguing the untrue truth, you know. You are having those trouble with your partner. Oh yeah blah blah -- what is the truth they are arguing, what is the untrue truth that they are arguing. What is the truth? What is this they argue, so this is a -- and it is embodied. It is embodied, it is in the way they walk, it is in the fact that they haven't been out in the sun for two years. It is in the fact that they have been sitting down on a chair and earning good money but dissolving their prefrontal cortex for lack of activity so on and so forth, nobody wants to be sick, but everybody wants to get better. Is it any wonder that we have great difficulty getting people to come into our rooms and work? I'm not sure, but in certain areas in America,when I look at the cultural things there was a heavy belief that they were sick and I'm not sure whether it’s universal, but certainly in some of the place,there is something wrong with me, I have to go to my shrink. And what was the wonderful thing Paul Hogan said in whatever was the Crocodile Dundee when he said do you see a shrink, and he said no we just tell Wally(ph), then he tell everybody else in town then everybody knows and what does it matter. So one of the untrue truth is that we need secrecy. That's not an untrue truth really because people know about you and they do terrible things to you.So, it’s kind of a truth but it’s an untrue truth because it makes you feel bad. So we need to be cautious about what people say, how easily is someone offended all these,no behaviors tend to be arguments for the untrue truth and yes behaviors.

RICHARD HILL And so again as Alan, was saying I don’t know why and what I’m doing my talk is really, I keep referring,but it's just absolutely true because it’s so wonderful. Don’t talk about the rubbish, don’t talk about what's bad, and don’t talk about the problems necessarily although you must respect them and acknowledge them and engage with them. What’s the positive where do we go, where do we take it, what’s it all about, where is the positive emotions. So let’s have a look. I want to introduced you to a term which I hope there’s a book out by this – later next year or hopefully, early beyond that I don’t know, but I’ve got a, I’ve got a -- a interesting client but they Interplay. 

01:15:10
The Interplay 

01:15:10
RICHARD HILL We need to start to look at the Interplay the mind, the brain, the body, the immune system. Now that doesn’t mean, let me put it in this way, it’s not like I’m asking you all to be able to be multiple players of things. 

01:15:20
DNA + Biology + Behaviour 

01:15:20
experience activity 

01:15:20
RICHARD HILL So let’s imagine that life it’s an orchestra.And you play the trumpet, that doesn't mean you have to learn how to play them, not saying go to learn the violin and go learn the piano and do that you’re not any good, unless you got 16 skills or whatever. But if you play the trumpet and all you do is just blare the bloody trumpet until you, until you’re blue on the face, without listening or caring or annoying then you tend to be a single minded therapist that may be doing good but you also may be doing not good, you don’t know. So, have some sense of what’s going on in the, in the, in the string section, and then the other areas of the wins and the wood wins and the tympanis and maybe you’re playing your trumpet away and you go I think actually is it my trumpet? No, I think I am on tune, I think it's the string section that’s having some trouble, I think it’s the DNA that’s having a bit of trouble, I think we had something going on in youth, we have actually got an orchid child here. Let’s go back and look at the attachment oh just a minute what I’ve got is, I’ve got someone who constantly feels drained and thinks do you get out in the sun? Do you do any exercise or how is your sleep? So on and so forth. They might say I have a such and such a concern, or such and such an issue and you might go well, this is a bit specialized for me, then you refer wouldn't it be great, if we were a team of practitioners instead of this blasted competitive commercializing people ways of, I’ve got four clients, I’vegot to keep up. No, I’m the only one who could fix you. This is the Interplay.

01:17:05
RICHARD HILL This is the interplay. What do you know about the vagus nerve? What do you know about the Autonomic nervous system? What do you know about the immune system? What do you know about the Neuropeptides? What do you know about the spinal cord? What do you know about serotonin? On the, on the – and its actions on Neuropeptide why – what do you know? What do you know? What do you want to know? I want to know a lot, I am going to go study it, I want to know a little bit, I am going to go to a Richard workshop or an Alan workshop or this workshop, and get a sense of it, so that when I play with my client, I can give my client a really strong connection of joy and as Alan said this morning neuroscience, it’s just showing us, it’s so helpful. I’ve got a client now if I, if I didn’t have neuroscience I don’t believe I would be doing as good a process as I’m doing.Yet, I think I'm doing the same process that I would have been doing anyway, but I know what I’m doing peek.So in this last couple of minutes, and then we have got a few minutes for questions. I’d like to introduce just a -- and another word description and a really simple form of thinking that applies to that. How can we get this positive – the positive psychology you know positive, I have difficulties with the term positive. Let’s get positive about this well you have to get positive – what I have to get positive, what am I negative, am I? And you’re positive for as long as you can be positive but as soon as you’re not positive what are you? Then you’re negative and if I’m negative I’m not being positive so is something wrong with me because I’m negative.So I have a little bit of problem just with the semantics of that I used to be – when I, my first inclination I was as an actor and then I did a linguistic degrees, so kind of language play.

01:19:05
Curiosity Oriented Approach To... 

01:19:05
That's interesting 

01:19:05
The problem is a message 

01:19:05
What can I create from this 

01:19:05
RICHARD HILL And I think this is being said. Jaak Panksepp has said this in his work with play.That’s in Broadman build stuff about the -- Ferguson talks about in positive psychology. It’s all a sort of the curiosity. Now when I was at the World Congress for Psychotherapy a little while ago nobody went because it’s too expensive, but the – I was talking to someone about Curiosity Oriented Approach To Therapy and she said oh we all do that we are all curious. And I said no, no, no, no, I actually got a, it’s a bit more than that zero or no, no, no. We then went into the keynote speech, who spent a whole time around an hour talking about we need to be curious in therapy and I thought nah ah, you know, but obviously it’s not universal. And when I’m talking about curious, I’m not talking about curiosity as in rapport curious, you know you tell me a bit about you, sort of Rogerian curious, which is wonderful. I'm talking about actually being curious, what can we do here we've now got so much research that says the vast majority of a productive and successful therapy is from the relationship. Then we have the belief that the therapist has in the practice that they, the technique that they use. Then we have the acceptor maybe it’s in a line, the acceptance that the client has that the therapist knows what he's doing, then we have a couple of other bits and pieces. I'm suggesting that for some people, I meant not all, so the last thing we want is another person getting up saying I have another therapy style that will cure the world. But for some people, active engagement on a relational basis with the client is a healthy thing because it is way in which you are bringing your instrument into the orchestra. And perhaps you are not an instrument in the Orchestra. Perhaps you are a chair, so they can sit down for a while. Perhaps you are a pair of glasses, so they can see the god damn music you help them understand. Perhaps you are just standing there holding my hand, maybe you’re turning around, I don't know. But you are not a benign blob in the experience and we have had that with, with a lot of therapies the -- the therapist who sat behind you and listened to it so on an so forth. You are a participant, now you can do this to any degree you want, I for example, I'm extremely self-disclosing, but I personally have very little fear about a lot of things. I, as an actor, once I went on national television there were million and a half people in the audience and I made some incredibly embarrassing mistakes, nothing bothers me. Now, really people say, there is going to be 100 people in the auditorium,really, oh you’ll benervous, I said anything shorter of a million and a half and I'm fine. But that's me, you know,that's me, so I've been a complete decayed in front of a lot of people, so I'm over it, which is I think I was -- it was a blessing, but but people came up to me after, they said oh Richard, I saw you on TV the other day, you were fantastic. I said didn't you know I did it, did you, oh, all right but you were on TV,you were fantastic, anyway that was all. So here is a three point actual verbal, process or, perhaps a mental process. First of all, to create curiosity and remember curiosity and creativity are hand in hand. Creativity is in itself everything about the positive thing without the face of the negative, even if you’re making something negative you are making something, it's more, it’s different, it’s somewhere to go. But that's interesting. Now those words, I worked on those for many years, lots of people said oh that's good or I like that or that's fascinating, now that's interesting. That changes your brain, that’s a yes, that's interesting, this is going somewhere. The second one is that the problem is almost always, the problem itself may be an issue, someone may have broken their leg, you know you got a leg defects, but the problem is almost always a message. There is always, always there and the nine voices are probably trying to talk to you collectively or singly in that problem, you know the problem is I mean I love it, don't you love it, when you got couples, have you had it and the one who is sitting there and they’re talking -- and then they point to you and they say and you are a problem too. That's interesting, I'm a problem too. I wonder what I can create from that.Now how many of you were waiting for me to be the demolished psychotherapist on the floor out, on my phone to the supervisor, going, oh sir there was a problem I was doing everything I could it was Rogerian, it was everything I was going mha aha mhu aha -- I got to do -- Which I did earlier on, and Sue will say, oh he never does that. I come out, you know, you should do that but, that's interesting, Richard you are an idiot. Wow, that’s interesting. Let me see, am I being an idiot, no actually, I'm pretty good, that was pretty good although the joke about the Church was a bit off. Wow, you’ve come and said you are, I wonder what you are trying to tell me, wonder what the message is and you’re telling me you’re an idiot. The fact that you’ve actually come over to tell me something that will hurt me, what's going on, oh sit down you might need a little bit of chair.And what can we create, now I might say, wow, thank you for telling me you’re an idiot, but I'm an idiot and I think that probably you're a really unpleasant person and that's okay and what I'm going to create from this is that I'm never going to have anything to do with you again. And what was your statement again, I don't think that that's an appropriate creativity, if it's a creativity but if I'm doing it out of no, out of no it hurts. But if I'm doing it, oh I know, off. Yes, great. Thank you, nothing more to stir, well then they might punch you on the head but you That's another issue, but this is a thing with the client, so the client comes in and says I have been coming to see you for three months and I'm worse. Again you are on the phone to this supervisor, yes, but start with, okay that's interesting, how it works , maybe you are and there is lots of research to show that a lot of therapies keep going, in particular if you're going for three months and there has been no improvement then you may actually be making it worse, you need to have something in the first five or six, I think Scott Miller was talking about this recently and they got something in the last couple of years, the first five or six treatments need to have some response, you know what are for, there to be some sense that there is a response being having even if that response is rapport. So, again did you know that, if you don't, why not and the reason why not is because it don't teaches him the damn courses. So we actually have to go to places to hear this stuff and there is more and more, the Internet is such a wonderful thing. So here is the philosophy, as we started, as you and I started. What's the purpose of life, I suggest and I live this myself is to. 

01:27:30
The Purpose of Life 

01:27:30
To creatively 

01:27:30
participate in 

01:27:30
the experience 

01:27:30
RICHARD HILL Creatively taking outwards, is to McGilchrist's right brain. Participate, be in the present, in the experience left brain focus in this experience, in life, life be in it and in being in it.We become a creative element that enables life to change all the way down to the DNA.As therapists, as people, as lovers, as friends, as carers, strangers, we are the interplay. Thank you.
