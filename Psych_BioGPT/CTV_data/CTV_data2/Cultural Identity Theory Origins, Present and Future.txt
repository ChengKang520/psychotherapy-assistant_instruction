CULTURAL IDENTITY THEORY: ORIGINS, CURRENT STATUS and the FUTURE William E. Cross, Jr. and Bailey W. Jackson 

00:00:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Hi, Bill. 

00:00:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hi. 

00:00:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON How are you doing? 

00:00:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This is gonna be fun. (laughs) 

00:00:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughs). Yeah. It's been a long time, uhm, coming actually... (crosstalk) 

00:00:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:00:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and, uhm, I'm looking forward to our just sort of having a chat. (crosstalk) 

00:00:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. Okay. 

00:00:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON I'm sure that other folks might enjoy listening in as it were. 

00:00:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That makes me think back to our luncheon we had maybe three, four years ago in which we did the same kind of thing. 

00:00:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Conversation, yeah. Yeah, I think that we might just start with what, ah, pretty much as we agreed to just kinda go into our origins (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:00:43
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, that's an interesting question because at the time it happened to me, I didn't know what was happening. 

00:00:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:00:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, I was wrapped up in the 1960's, ah, period. And, it was an overly exciting time and people were becoming poets. People were becoming, ah, artists. And even though I had a psychology background, I guess it was a time that I was becoming dedicated to psychology. 

00:01:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And, ah, I remember in my own experience the model... (crosstalk) 

00:01:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON (coughs). 

00:01:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...was in my head. It was an autobiographical statement because I was... (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...going through changes... (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:01:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and keeping tabs on this. And then later, I discovered that there were probably two experiences that caused the, the origins to kind of flow. 

00:01:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I went through a tremendous religious deconversion. I went through a... (crosstalk) 

00:01:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Tell me, I missed that part. Okay. 

00:01:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...(inaudible ) I don't know I'd, had a struggle with a God notion. 

00:01:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh-huh. 

00:01:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that they worked in reverse, a deconversion. 

00:01:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I do remember there at one point where I was still falling in my knees to pray that night. But I knew intellectually that didn't make sense because I had affirmed that maybe there was no God. 

00:01:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Huh. 

00:01:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So they gave me some insights to the notion of lag. (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:01:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We could have one identity. And you, you affirm me another. But... (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:01:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... they were kind of a struggle. 

00:01:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:01:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And the second thing was my training in clinical psychology where we always had a phase notion. You, the person enters into therapy. 

00:02:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And even as they enter, there is some sort of encounter that makes them really see the deeper issue. 

00:02:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:02:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then there's a struggle for trying to resolve what are the deeper issues and then if they're successful, move into ah, ah, called(ph), "a new state." 

00:02:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So those in the back of my mind must have been helping me to have the lenses to see the stages as Black people evolved in their identity during the '60s. 

00:02:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's great. 

00:02:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. And so it's first personal and then that person will get wrapped into some of the training that I have. 

00:02:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. Yeah. And then you went right, so talk to me about how that sort of came to paper in terms of stages. 

00:02:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's interesting. And part of it was quite social. I was, ah, dating a woman who would become my wife. 

00:02:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh-huh. 

00:02:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, ah, she was probing me on my interest and so on. And I had, I had actually lectured a couple of times at a very small level on this notion of stages but never put it to, to print. And we sat down one night after going out for a drink in her office. And she typed out an outline of the stages. 

00:03:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Of what you were saying? 

00:03:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Of what I was saying. 

00:03:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Now, that's. (crosstalk) 

00:03:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then we thought she would coauthor it. And she said no. She said, "This is your stuff." But she assisted in getting me over the hesitation to write... (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-uh. Uh-huh. 

00:03:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...coz I've never written anything for the book for the time of the original letter. 

00:03:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughs) Okay. 

00:03:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Pretty bad. 

00:03:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:03:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. My brother is a dad. (laughs) 

00:03:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. (laughs) 

00:03:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, ah, from there, a friend who you and I did know the Defoster(ph). 

00:03:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes. 

00:03:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. He was at Princeton. 

00:03:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:03:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And, ah, he was already there as, as a, a student. And he and another fellow were talking about putting together ah, a book together called, "Beyond Black or White." (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON All right. 

00:03:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Like the Defoster(ph) and, ah, I'm blocking now on the other colleague, that's terrible. Ah, and so they asked me to write a chapter. 

00:03:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON I see. 

00:03:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so the first official, ah, piece was really meant for "Beyond Black or White." 

00:03:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:03:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But it actually came out. There was a time, Black, the, but the Black world version appeared first. So that actually technically was version two, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:04:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. you know. 

00:04:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay, great, great. 

00:04:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But you have also a tie between, I, I also referred to myself as a "process psychologist"... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:04:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... or process person. So I was trained to see process. Like(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:04:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I think if I recall from our discussion, there was a similar connection in your own word. 

00:04:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, in a way. I came at uhm, what I've called the Black Identity Development theory, uhm, in a way to try to answer some dilemmas that I was faced with as a clinician. Uhm, I was, uhm, working at a, what was called in those days a growth center in the days of, ah, personal awareness and sensitivity and all of that... (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:04:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...kind of thing. And I was, ah, (clears throat) part of the staff in, in, in New York. And, uhm, ah, we would do a lot of training for groups that were coming that mostly this... (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Right. 

00:04:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...consciousness racism stuff. Uhm, and I noticed that, ah, while I was into it... (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:05:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...I mean, I, I was getting the peak experience... (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:05:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...just like everybody else, (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON you know, I began to pay attention to the fact that the people I was working with were primarily White. And I was, uhm, a young Black professional out of the streets of New York City basically. And, and there was a contradiction and so what's wrong with this picture. Or another way of saying this is what would, what I'm doing here really relevant... (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:05:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to my own experiences and the people I know. Ah, along that same time, I began to pay attention to what was happening to the very few, ah, Black and Latina folk that were in these workshops, training programs. And in most cases, what was happening to them is, ah, well, it's kind of a mixture of things. But some of them, the, the experiences we'd just write on, they would write in with the sensitivity stuff and the... (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:05:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...sharing in the blind trust walks and all of that kind of stuff. And they were moving and grooving and having peak experiences like everybody else. But there were some other folks who would just couldn't relate to this. 

00:06:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON They, they cal, they saw there's just more White stuff... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:06:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...for want of a better term, right, and would challenge me about how I got wrapped up in this, how did I get so far from the, the street? How did I get so far from the experience of Black people, ah, which was a challenge, I, and asked well, what's going on here? 

00:06:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:06:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON First, how do I make sense of the fact that there were Black folks in these workshops who were relating to this stuff and then there were others who were just vehemently, vehemently opposed to whatever was going on and there were some that were sort of in the middle. They seemed to be moving and grooving... (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:06:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...during the workshop. 

00:06:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:06:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON But afterwards, they'd pull me aside and sort of have these conversations about whether or not this was really relevant... (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:06:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON  to the, the black experience. (Clears throat) More than being sort of put off by that, I was challenged to understand what it was or how it was that these people were seeing the same experience differently. 

00:07:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:07:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  What were the lenses that they were looking through to make ex, you know, sense of these experiences? Anyway, the long and short of that story to some extent is that, uhm, from that question came, ah, sort of quest to understand what I call the lenses. 

00:07:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The lenses, okay. 

00:07:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. And the lenses were, in some sense, was a metaphor for consciousness. 

00:07:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:07:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON What was the consciousness that they were carrying around that caused them to see, these folks to see the same event and interpreted differently 'coz one of the things of, and one of things that was clear to me was that, there somewhere in there was race and racism. 

00:07:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:07:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON  But my training didn't help me understand it from that perspective. There were no models like ours there... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:07:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that would help ah, me to understand it. And so... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  In some way, race was downplayed other than a strategic, you know, and ah. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah. I mean we were, you know, we were in the hot bed of the '60s, but still we were still so immersed in experiencing that. We weren't ready to sort that back. Anyway, I then, then did a, a kind of historical, ah, analysis of the experience of Black people... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:08:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in this country to try to understand what was the consciousness of Black people at different phases all the way back to reconstruction, okay? And one of the things I could see was that, you know, the, the sort of, uhm, the lenses as we moved from reconstruction through the different periods, Garveyism... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Hmm. 

00:08:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and so on and so forth that we had different kinds of, ah, takes on our own blackness, (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON different ways in making sense of our relationships through the White people in the White society and so on and so forth. Anyway, after I kind of got it carved out and it was fol, unfolding into some stages, I said, (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:09:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON "Wow, I experienced this personally. 

00:09:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:09:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay, and by the way, this might be what's going on with those people... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. With other people. Okay. Yeah. 

00:09:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in those workshops." And so what happened then was I got to the stages. Now, the funny thing was I had written all the stuff down, came to some through. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We're like keeping like in a, not a, a journal or just... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...a diary. Okay. I didn't know that? 

00:09:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON  And, ah, so I had to sort of, uhm, you know, the stages... (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...pretty well defined, well approved. And I was sort of using them as sort of personal lenses to use to make sense of what was going on in groups I was working with... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:09:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...or in counseling sessions or in group therapy, whatever. What, is this model helping me understand what's going on? And it seemed to be working. Now, two things I think are key here for me is that at that same time, I decided that I didn't wanna share this model... (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

00:10:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...because I was really afraid of it because I had been reared on developmental models, stage models and so on. Ah, I remember at one point really being immersed in Erikson's stages... (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Great(ph). 

00:10:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and so on and watched how, uhm, some folks used those stages to pigeon whole(ph) people. 

00:10:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:10:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON So I was warned to be really careful of that. But I'd also found it helpful. And I would share it with some friends. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. All right. 

00:10:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON And people would say, "Oh, you gotta go publicly with this." 

00:10:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:10:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Well, I think for, this was for a couple of years, and then, I guess, around the early '70s, I'm doing my reading and along comes this guy, Cross, (laughter) this guy, Bill Cross. And I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:10:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...reading his stuff, and I think it was, oh, I'm trying to remember what piece it was but it was the thing you did with Hall and, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Oh, yes, Bill Hall, ah, Roy Freedle and yes. 

00:10:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...(inaudible ) and Freedle and (inaudible ). 

00:10:58
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This is at ah, ah, American college testing. 

00:11:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:11:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And he would, and they were at educational testing... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:11:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  ah, what do you call the Princeton thing, ETS, yes. 

00:11:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON And, now, was this all the White sociology, the, ah, death of. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That appeared in a number of places. I think one of them was, ah, "The Death of White Sociology." 

00:11:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON But it was also in the, uhm, "Black Psychology." (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. No. It was not that. It was in the first edition of, ah, Black Psychology by Reginald Jones. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Black Psychology, Reginald Jones, right. And I'd. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that was a reproduction of. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. And I said, "I'll be damn." This guy beat me through it." (Laughs) 

00:11:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. (Laughs) I had the same response when I read the 1970 piece in Psychology Today... (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  by, ah, Charles Thomas. I was a young kid scared of my what's a, "Oh, boy, there's, you know, there's nothing left here." 

00:11:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:11:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And when I read his piece which was a, a key piece, ah, clearly one of the first models. (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And by the way we should point out that you, myself, Charles Thomas, Jake Malone's, there was about 11 people including the few Whites... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:11:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, Whites. Almost all of them though were embedded in some form of process psychology... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:12:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...more of the, the clinical psychological, ah, or even theory making for process side... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...not the academics that was very interesting. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The whole(ph) and a few. And he, he was trained in clinical. Anyway, people were kind of position scattered in the United States, all observing what essentially was the same thing... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:12:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. 'coz it was happening in L.A. It was happening in San Francisco. But it's curious that when you talk to individuals, they became a little nervous when they heard about someone else's writing. (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Quite right. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, and in one case, one, ah, fellow, who he, he became quite paranoid and I remember he accused me of having taken his stuff. 

00:12:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, but I think I will always probably have a little touch of that when you encountered the other. (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure, sure, yeah. 

00:12:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, that's interesting. 

00:12:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Well, yeah, I, why, when I read yours, I didn't feel competitive at all, (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:12:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON well, I guess maybe a little bit. (laughs) 

00:12:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. (laughs) You wanna see your face, okay? 

00:12:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON But it was kind of like "Geez, how, how can we get together?" 

00:12:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Ah, yes. 

00:12:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON You know? 

00:12:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:12:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON And, uhm, I read your stages, and I looked at mine. And I said, it's so, you know, the basic structure... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...of what we were trying to do was the same. We def, we described the stages a little slightly... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:13:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON  a little differently. We had different names. Uhm, but, uhm, there was just so much overlapping. 

00:13:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:13:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:13:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Essentially, as, as you talk about the voices... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:13:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...because, uhm, and it, and you're almost, it's a, it's like a process within it, within a process. First, it was like we tested it personally. This is kind of doing something for ourselves. 

00:13:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:13:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And then because of respect of other people, I know I had tremendous respect for the fact that blind people were different points, ah, that different, ah, ah, positions in the social order. 

00:13:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:13:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And there was this tremendous notion of the, ah, of leveling, not feeling as if you're middleclass, that you're better than someone's working class. 

00:13:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:13:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Likewise, ah, vice versa, someone who is working class was not better than middleclass. And so I had this notion of, you know, you can't impose this on people. 

00:13:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:13:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But then to see someone who, ah, old Jimmy Reed who was a friend of mine from high school, who was, ah, wasn't a panther member. But he... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm.. 

00:13:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...was a closet, he was kind of a panther type... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, in the panther type organization. Talking to him and, wow, he was going through the same kinds... (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...of things, then going to Chicago at the OBAC, the Organization for Black American Culture. They had developed some rituals, not joined by some notion of psychology but of the artist, (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:14:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. the artist becoming. 

00:14:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Yeah, I know. 

00:14:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so all of a sudden, and then there were these caucuses (inaudible ) book that sprung out, this black sociologist caucus, black psychologist caucus. So you could even see where even groups of people work in codifying it, that the more I saw it, the more I tasted it, as you put it, the more you've heard these other voices kind of gave a little, a little, I won't say a lot, a little more confidence. 

00:14:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Sure. 

00:14:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So I must admit I still had to be pushed into writing about it... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:14:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...not so much of the fear of labeling but the whole demonic, ah, ah, ah, intimidation of writing, you know? 

00:14:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:14:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, ah, and yet in a, in a lecture format, I felt very comfortable to talk about it but... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:14:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  not necessarily to, ah, share. 

00:14:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON The other thing I, I got a hold of as a result to that, ah, whole era was the importance of the statement that theories are as ostensively for the theorist. 

00:15:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes, yeah. 

00:15:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Ah, and I mean I think what we're saying confirms that, that, that we developed them, I developed them for me... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to help me make sense of what was going on in situations, clinical situations... (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:15:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that I was learning situations that I was confirmed with and the model worked. Then they extend to which that is useful to other people... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:15:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON 'coz sometimes they extend to which it becomes popular. 

00:15:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's intriguing because it was Bill Hall who at Princeton said that if; he didn't put in these stark terms. 

00:15:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This thing seems to have value. How can you test it? 

00:15:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that's where I journeyed toward a more academic career... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, in which the issue became in conjunction with people in clinical, in conjunction with people in the applied field. 

00:15:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Nonetheless, is, does this have enough boundaries to it that we can actually apply, ah, empirical research to it. 

00:16:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:16:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that led to that, that career. Ah, sometimes, people mistake that as either or better than or whatever the kind of thing we talked about earlier. But they'll tutor me to understand that if as ah, budding African American scholars, we could not codify this in the fashion that other people could replicate. 

00:16:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that calls, that called it into question... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to arrive in this whole discourse about better than that wasn't the issue. 

00:16:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:16:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. He was saying that, "You should be able to find enough contours here to be able to demonstrate it not so much with numbers but a meaningful way to measure it." (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:16:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that led to some of the early research. 

00:16:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  I think I'm ready to move into, with some overview. 

00:16:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:16:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON I mean, this is where we saw the transition of phase... (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Phase in, phase in and out, great, yeah. 

00:16:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...from one, and one to the other. So.(crosstalk) 

00:16:40
The Present Status of Cultural Identity Theory 

00:16:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yes, of, I guess to begin with, I would say that it struck me that there was something going on... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in which a person brought with him a developed identity. 

00:17:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Then they would have some sort of encounter to want a change 'coz it, they had to end up with that encounter wanting to change. And then there'd be this kind of almost war between the new and the old. 

00:17:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so there was this middle phase, kind of a, an up and down kind of phase. 

00:17:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And then if things went well, there would be this new point of identity... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in which the person seemed to be more relaxed. And things seem to be internal rather than grasping for. And then I found I wanted to make a distinction between those people who tended to, ah, make it mostly kind of a personal psychological change... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  versus those who did that but also talked about long term commitment... (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ended up being long distance runners, so to speak. 

00:17:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, I went back to label them. And the labels, I think, are important. And, and, and it's important that we describe each one. 

00:17:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:17:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  I have decided that preconscious or something like that made it appear as though the person didn't have an identity in the first place. So I used the word, pre-encounter, to describe the identity before the encounter. 

00:18:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:18:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So pre-encounter meant the identity to be changed, the discussion of the dynamics of the identity to be changed. Encounter, I thought, was a good term because the person would have to have some kind of encounter to cause them to want to change from their old to something new. They had to see that there was something else out there... (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. 'coz in some ways, the old identity would block them from seeing... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...the other identity. And then immersion, immersion captured for me the fact that the, in the middle phases, there was a dipping into blackness or dipping into wanting to be this new self, kind of a diving in a blind faith, almost oceanic kind of thing... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:18:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and then kind of coming out... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...where you can almost imagine dipping something in some beautiful dark oil. 

00:18:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And the bowl might be silver. But when you bring it out, it's coated by the oil... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but now, no longer suffocating in it... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. 'coz there's a point in which the first part seems to maybe lead to possible suffocation. And then I'm sure the word, "internalization," which is so ubiquitous in our field. I'm not sure to where I grabbed it from. But internalization seemed to be right kind of word. It, it became internal. It became a part of the person. 

00:19:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:19:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  In that final stage, internal, ah, internalization commitment was meant to imply kind of a, a long distance journey so that when I first wrote it we'll, we'll be talking about this, I did think of pre-encounter more in terms of self hatred, that the dynamics of Kenneth Clark's notion of self hatred seemed to apply. 

00:19:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I stressed maybe less issues of miseducation but self hatred first... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...the encounter of the, an awakening to one's, ah, unauthentic or, ah, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Negative identity and a desire to change that. The immersion, immersion would be the war between the two selves... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...the old self hating self and the, and the emergence of a new. And then I did have a notion that not everybody would make it smoothly. 

00:20:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, I'd, as you know in the model, I do talk about getting stuck, regressing and so on. Then if things go well, there's a notion of internalization... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Yeah. 

00:20:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...which in its early stages did imply a notion of calmness but a notion of black people reaching a sense of consensus and as you know my more recent piece, I changed that. In any case, the original notion was consensus and unity and then internalization commitment to be where does, unity somehow is played out in a... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:20:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...long distance notion. (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Let me jump in there. Yeah, I feel like what you've done is, is, is to describe the, the stages that you, at your sort of, uhm, initial development. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:20:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON So let me do mine. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:20:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON And then we can together sort of talk about how each of them has evolved... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Evolved, okay. 

00:20:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and up into the present and maybe even into the future. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The future. (laughs). 

00:20:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, uhm, right. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I like, I like your optimism. (laughs) 

00:21:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughs) Now, it's, it, the thing is just, is so alive for me... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:21:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON  that to think that I'm gonna develop it and then what I've come up with is gonna be the sort of thing that's gonna, (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Plastic plant purposes(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that's gonna go on... 

00:21:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:21:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...forever. 

00:21:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:21:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON It's crazy. I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:21:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON uhm, I continue to work with it. I continue to learn from it. It's alive with me. 

00:21:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:21:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON And to some extent, I think that, uhm, ah, it grows as I grow. 

00:21:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:21:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON So anyway for whatever that's worth. I started with four stages. They would call the, ah, acceptance resistance. Ah, in those days, they were called redirection. 

00:21:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON And while I call it internalization now, you just reminded my first time I called it integration. 

00:21:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I remember that, yeah. Didn't you write integration in your new pieces? (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON I think I was... (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's right. 

00:21:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in an issue, I was on integration. And I must confess I was influenced by your use of the word, internalization. 

00:21:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  So you went to find another term. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON And I like internalization better... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:21:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...because I think the reason I changed from integration was that it had all of these other connotations... (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Right. 

00:22:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that I didn't really want to get into. But I started with the notion that the observation that, ah, we were, ah, actually the acceptance stage, the first stage, was really called passive acceptance. 

00:22:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:22:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON All right? And as you, as you know now in the current, it's also an active acceptance. 

00:22:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:22:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON But there was not a bad act of acceptance in those, in the initial version. It was passive acceptance which was meant to, to connote the, the notion that we were, uhm, ah, we were buying in. 

00:22:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Or to use Paolo Ferrari's terms, we were playing host to our own impression. 

00:22:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:22:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON But we were not doing it consciously, that it was passive, that it was, that it was like built into the war. It was part of a socialist. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. It was almost not, not self reflected now. It was there. 

00:22:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, no, it's not. We kind of grew up. And if you grow up in the society, it's gonna get on you, (laughs) okay? Uhm, and then the second was really, uhm, uhm, a recognition that there was a struggle. 

00:23:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:23:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON  To get rid of that stuff off me. And that's the resistance. And at that time, I called it active resistance, okay? So there was passive acceptance and an active resistance. And I was influenced by all of the stuff in the '60s which I saw would, ah, to be what was going on. We were actively resisting to some extent. 

00:23:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh-huh. 

00:23:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON The, the, the sort of consciousness of the '50s and '40s and, and before for a lot of us, all sort of trying to buy in and assimilate and so on. 

00:23:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So in some way resisting this identity which we had passively accepted. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. Right. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But we we were actively rejecting it. 

00:23:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, right. Ah, there is a term that our, a buddy of mine, uhm, colleague, Fred Jefferson uses, uhm, ah, getting rid of the internalized negativisms of the self (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:23:51
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. Right. 

00:23:51
BAILEY W. JACKSON But at any rate, uhm, so there's the resistance, uhm, and then, then third stage at the time was "Okay, once, we've been through the resistance. 

00:24:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Now, we struggle with uhm, ah, a refocusing of our energy. 

00:24:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Because the resistance is resisting to something outside of me. 

00:24:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:24:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON And so a lot of this was paying attention to where our attention was. 

00:24:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. Ah, interesting. 

00:24:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON So the consciousness who said that there is no attention, it's just, we just take what comes in. The resistance is I'm attending to those folks outside of me primarily the White folks and... (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...the White culture. And I'm trying to resist that. The redirection suggested, "Okay. Now, I'm not going to pay attention to you anymore." 

00:24:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:24:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  "I'm gonna pay attention to me." So the third stage which is now called redefinition, I, at that time, I called redirection. 

00:24:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Redirection of energy, redirection of folks, (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...focus. So it was more introspective. 

00:24:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Again, it was an attempt to describe, uhm, in the historical sense the Garvey era... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ... or in a more contemporary sense the, uhm, the, ah, those folks that, that run through the rancor at the time... (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and the, and the immemorable rockers and so on who were attempting to build a Black community almost a separatist... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:25:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...notion. 

00:25:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then they, they said redefining was a crucial part of that, (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. yeah. 

00:25:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON  And so, and then doing that independent. 

00:25:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:25:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Of what was going on outside, right? 

00:25:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:25:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Then the, then the next stage, the integration said, "Okay, once you've built that sense of self, you have a choice point. You can either stay 'separate.'" 

00:25:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON I know what some people call segregated. I'd make a distinction between that and separation. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:25:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON "But stay separate or you can take that identity and internalize it. 

00:25:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:25:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON And figure out who you are with this identity in this other culture or the term, the biculturism that, that... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:25:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...the blog talks about. 

00:25:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. The dual self. 

00:25:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON I, I said the dual self. 

00:25:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:25:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON And try to figure out whether it's a dual or whether it's a hybrid, whether it's a new self or whether it's taking that self and operating in an alien environment. But that was the integration. It's the integrating of that identity coming from the redirection stage into this. 

00:26:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  One thing as I was going curious is that on, in hindsight to me, that was a very gutsy move, your discussion of the final stage 'coz there was tremendous pressure. I, I don't think we saw it that way. But there was such, ah, euphoria around this new blackness... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

00:26:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that the notion of integration was almost anathema but you did early on talk about this notion of reintegration. Did you, (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Well, it's interested(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. did you receive a (inaudible ) from that? (crosstalk) 

00:26:34
BAILEY W. JACKSON I got some flak. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:26:36
BAILEY W. JACKSON I got some flak, ah, because when people heard that or read it, one of the assumptions they made was that you went from the "militancy of the resistance"... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:26:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...which people were, you know, I had sort of romanticized it at the time. And then you went to this redirection which people were sort of not real clear about it... (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You(ph) know, you(ph) know. 

00:26:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON They're not really sure they liked that either. 

00:26:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. (laughs) 

00:26:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Because it was like you weren't confronting the system. 

00:27:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:27:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON You were sort of naval contemplating. 

00:27:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:27:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON You are sort of like in, focusing internal, inside the community or said, "What did that have to do with fighting racism and confronting the system." But they could sort of say, "Well, okay, I understand those folks were sort of going off into anything." But this other notion of internalizing or integrating, I said, "Wait a minute. After all of that, you're gonna go back into, does that mean you're... (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:27:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...assimilating." Without recognizing that from my perspective and it me a while as I read and explain this like that." At the resistance level, one of the things I learned is about power. 

00:27:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:27:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON And how to deal with power. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Power. Okay. 

00:27:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON All right? The problem with the, the way I learned about power at the resistance stage is that it's reactive. 

00:27:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:27:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Okay, as opposed to proactive which is, which only comes as a result... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Of the actually the aging. 

00:27:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...of the grappling... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...with who I am that happens at the redirection of redefinition stage. 

00:27:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? So now, you got somebody who has the sort of, ah, understanding in my power and power politics of a social level. 

00:28:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, group on group, (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:28:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ... the resistance coupled with, hmm, a sense of direction. And I am this... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in the redirection or redefinition stage. Now, how much more powerful is that person at the internalization stage? And then I had... (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. What defines power? 

00:28:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. And then I had to tie in to make it, to show examples, I tied it back to the autobiography about the next. 

00:28:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. All right. 

00:28:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON And you could see the point at which he was at resistance and then the point at which he went to the redirection or redefinition when he went back to Islam. 

00:28:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:28:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON And then came back to the U.S. which for me is the internalization... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...with a new definition of racism. 

00:28:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:28:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON It was no longer just the White man... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:28:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...as it was in the, you know, the white devil. It was to, to use his language in, ah, in the resistance stage. Now is the White system. And it was a much more global. And we could do the same thing with Martin Luther King. We could do the same thing with my(ph) Angelo. And you could sort of track their undevelopment. And so some people get it. Some don't. But. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. In fact, you know even with the recent, ah, film, Malcolm X, there was some debate on that... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:29:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... whether or not the film was, ah, somehow misconstruing. 

00:29:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Right. 

00:29:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, and it's often where people can't understand that a person can be totally grounded in a particular group's frame of reference and struggle. 

00:29:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But that can actually end up allowing them to see other people struggle, (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:29:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. not to leave their struggle... (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:29:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but to see that... (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:29:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...it is connected to some of the bigger generic issues. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, right. 

00:29:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And still, still, I've, we, we have, when I say we, Charles Thomas and myself received a lot of flak around the issue of transcendence. 

00:29:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The transcendence mean to leave... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON To leave. 

00:29:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that you become Black and then leave it. 

00:29:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, ah, and in fact, I found the word so troublesome that later on, I'm gonna talk about the word, "bridging." 

00:29:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Because I find the word, "bridging," should mean you have two points which... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh mmm. 

00:29:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...are connected. And the person has the power and the will to go back and forth... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:30:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...whereas many people think transcend means to one direction... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:30:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...not a bridge, but leaving out. 

00:30:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Leave out, yeah. 

00:30:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:30:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's, that's true, that's transcendent to some of our, the changes, how has it, how has it begun to evolve? 

00:30:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This has, you know, and in fact, this has been something that's fascinated me just as a human being. 

00:30:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I, I, at one point, thought it was a done deal. 

00:30:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, I remember once when I was being reviewed by, ah, some fellow African American scholars that I was told, "You know you're stuck. 

00:30:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Why don't you move onto something else?" 

00:30:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I began to drift from the model like it does. 

00:30:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You know, wondered what else should I do in my life. 

00:30:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And then some young people, ah, ah, Janet Helms, ah, at the University of Maryland, ah, who you know. 

00:30:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:30:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then, ah, Thomas Parham who is his, her, her student. 

00:30:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They energized me again. They, phone calls, what are you doing, whatever. I thought they were conducting research showing it, ah, applied to contemporary scenes. And that happened about, what, six years ago? 

00:31:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yap. Yeah. 

00:31:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, and that caused me to get back into it. And then in 1991, as you know, I published the book called, "Shades of Black" ah, Diversity in African American Identity. That book has two parts, one which I attacked; an ocean of self hatred is being overused in the analysis of Black identity. And by the way, I feel comfortable using Black identity as you do, ah, in African... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON African-American (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:31:27
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...American identity. So what, I later change it. We're primarily talking about people of African descent in the United States. 

00:31:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:31:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We don't mean to imply that this is for Brazilians. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right and a more global, yeah. 

00:31:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, and then in the second part of the book I, I decided, "Hey let's go for it. What have you learned in this? What do people do their research? What doesn't fit anymore?" 

00:31:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:31:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And there are a number of things I tried to redo in the, in the 1991 version. But the first, well, it, it, it, probably two key things that I've done is to move from a notion of self hatred as being the driving force of this. And I think that's true for the past as well as the present to a notion of salience, of race... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  importance of race in a person's life. 

00:32:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, and the other was to realize that in the final stages, unity is not necessarily achieved... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  that people, black people developed a, a sense of connection. But this connection does not override some really strong, sometimes vicious ideological differences. 

00:32:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

00:32:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So that, in a sense, if you can imagine I started out with a notion of diversity in the first stage... 

00:32:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:32:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and in depth with the notion of diversity and then tried to ask these kind of micro questions, "Okay, but how are the people alike and different?" 

00:32:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:32:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Saliency of race or importance of race... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:32:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...as opposed to self hatred is important for me now in the pre encounter stage. 

00:32:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:32:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Barely I kept running into people who from my vantage point and I think the research shows it as well who are either somewhat so or very clearly so in the first stage they were pre encounter. 

00:33:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  But they seemed to have decent marriages. 

00:33:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh-huh. 

00:33:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They often were married to other Black people. 

00:33:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They often were in the black community itself. They often were carrying their light out in Black groups. 

00:33:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But there seemed to be a, a notion of culture that was missing. Or they are indifferent about it. Ah, they would say things like, ah, "I'm Black, but so what" to be a bit rude... (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, right, right, right, right. 

00:33:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, were the so what then? Yes, I am a physically black person. But I don't see where that's that important to me in my everyday life. 

00:33:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

00:33:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And as I probed deeper, they had an identity... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. or identities... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  sometimes when I, identity based on their religion. 

00:33:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I don't mean to make, ah, I'm not being antichristian but I'm simply saying it was their religion that played more of a role in their life than in the race. 

00:33:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It almost, ah, or, or they might be a lawyer. Or they might be a, a, a dude in the gang. And so the gang had more importance. 

00:33:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:33:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In their own minds, they saw this is as being black. 

00:33:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:33:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  But when you, when you analyzed it... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:34:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...from a cultural perspective, they seemed to be doing what? Placing more weight on this... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...a more salience on this... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:34:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...less salience on race and culture. I also found some people who were self hating in the classic sense of the term. They had very negative views of black people. And they had very negative views of themselves. 

00:34:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:34:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But that piece seemed to be smaller than the other piece. So then in the new writing, I talk a great deal about how we can talk about people being in pre-encounter where we describe it with dynamics other than self hatred. 

00:34:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah(ph). 

00:34:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So miseducation now has more importance in my new version than does self hatred... (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  which cut ties into your comments earlier about naivety... 

00:34:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:34:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and, and the past resistance. And therefore encounter, and, and so I almost described this issue of pre-encounters more a philosophical thing. 

00:34:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:34:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You know the person has almost, has a world view, has a voice. I like the way you use your voice, where they do have a voice. It has texture. And as long as there is no one to raise their consciousness, they're happy with it. 

00:34:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. Yeah, right. 

00:34:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And it works. And so encounters remain somewhat a saying 'coz what happens to cause the person to want to reevaluate it? Immerse, immersion remains basically the same. I try to write with greater claribly, clarity and so on. I do spend more time in the new model trying to talk about how people get stuck, how they regress, how they stagnate, but essentially that's the play on the, on the old model. 

00:35:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. Yeah. 

00:35:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, we have this issue of salience, and now, we jump all the way to the final stage, which I have placed more energy in. I became aware of about the research and experience that people do end up in the final stages... (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... placing more salience or importance on culture and race in the final stages than do the people in the first stage. 

00:35:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So their yielding, if you will, is that they all agree that race and culture has more importance to their life, whereas the people in pre-encounter will either deny it... (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or the case of the self-aiding types, they denigrate it. 

00:35:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So that would be the point of, of, of... (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON So. 

00:35:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...consensus. But, I find myself seeing black people clustering into at least three, uhm, frames of reference with regard to the importance of race... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in their everyday life. 

00:36:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. One cluster tends to be a nationalistic cluster. There were those who when they go through the identity change, they developed an ideology that is explicitly nationalistic. 

00:36:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, and they're to be, ah, distinguished from those who have, well, I call it bicultural or, ah, ah, ah, yeah, bicultural frame... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...more of a two-missed frame kind of an Americaness and Blackness frame. 

00:36:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And even those two categories can be separated from those who have a multicultural frame. 

00:36:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. Say more about that one. 

00:36:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Where, ah, in a sense, they may not only embrace their Blackness. 

00:36:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:36:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Not only their Americaness. 

00:36:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:36:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But they maybe somebody into Hi, His, Hispanic frame... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON I see. 

00:36:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... or into a gay frame... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:36:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or into a Russian frame. And in a sense, they a, a, are not saying this is, that these things are more important than my Blackness... (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but they have a sense of shared saliencies, shared importantness... 

00:37:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  to, to their cultural frame. 

00:37:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Can I only go back and give some texture to it? 

00:37:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:37:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  In the book, I try to make a distinction between nationalists who are what I call vulgar, vulgar nationalist... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

00:37:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...where in some ways, I reinvented the worst of what European, Eurocentrism has given us, almost defining race as a biologic entity... (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and almost suggesting that you are born with a certain nationalistic proclivity. And I just, I find that, ah, offensive to, ah, any kind of progressive way of looking at these issues. 

00:37:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They're to be distinguished from, ah, the more traditional nationalists. Ah, the paragon at the most beautiful example of which for me anyways, the theorist would be Ron Karenga. 

00:37:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Or, or pardon me, Maulana Karenga. 

00:37:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I remember him also for... (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, sure. 

00:37:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...a many times. Ah. Ma, Maulana has talked about the issue of nationalism from the point of view of history, sociology, anthropology, et cetera. 

00:38:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You can debate that kind of nationalism... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...because it's not in your genes, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a malleable concept. It's an intellectual concept, if you will, that can be discussed. Anyway, people come out of this, this thing, this thing we call the bra, the nigrescence experience and some developed a very well-elaborate national frame of reference. Now, the thing there is that such people tend to suggest that Blackness has a more categoric importance to their life and sometimes, they're not open... (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to having other things being important, too. 

00:38:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, I have to make a distinction, therefore, between the, the nationalist versus those people who will may come out it. They seem to, and this I borrow greatly as you know, from your own word. 

00:38:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  From an afirna, affirmation of the Blackness and a affirmation of some aspects of their Americaness. 

00:39:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's like they have a (inaudible ) with their Americaness... (crosstalk) 

00:39:03
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:03
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that not everything about it being American, none of them, one can be denied. 

00:39:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:39:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Can I deny they speak English and so and so on. Ah, and that there is this twoness to me, but this twoness does not mean I'm schizophrenic or split. 

00:39:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:39:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It means that I have a cultural entity that is actually grounded in two experiences. 

00:39:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:39:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And therefore, a Marcella's... (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON It's kind of a hybrid. 

00:39:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. A hybrid. 

00:39:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:39:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But these terms unfortunately have been used so... (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Abused. (laughing) 

00:39:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Pejoratively. 

00:39:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:39:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We see it more in a jazz... (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...where there's an unabashed affirmation of some European strains of music and some African strains and then the jazz artists often don't debate this, you know, that that... (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...I am these two things... (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:39:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  and the issue is to carry to the nth degree. Ah, with Marcella is to be an example of such a spokesperson. Well, beyond that, though, I'm, I'm discovering African-Americans who are feeling comfortable with their Blackness. They seem they have gone to the stages one way or another. They, maybe even affirmed a part of their Americaness, but they go beyond that... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and they may soar a tremendous, intellectual, artistic, or this everyday activity concern for other, even other groups and not necessarily Black groups. So, I have a student I know at Cornell who has these other two components, as American, as Blackness, but he is an expert in Japanese, ah, languages... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and Japanese culture. 

00:40:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ... Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And it's more than just a pragmatic expertise, he's into it. So, when you talk to him, there are times you need to be talking to someone from Japan. 

00:40:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. There are times you can be talking to someone from America. There is few times you can be talking about someone in this from a community. 

00:40:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So that's what I mean, by, by multicultural. 

00:40:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so, my final rewrite, not final, my latest rewriting is trying to describe internalization... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  and how it connects to these three, at least, possibilities as an example of the diversity... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:40:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that can exist, though. 

00:40:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON It's true. So, you can have, ah, a high degree of salience and come from any of these three... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Any of these three... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...points. 

00:40:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  and quite frankly, they can lead to some pretty tough, sometimes, ah, cru, ah, cru, (inaudible )debates... (crosstalk) 

00:41:03
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:41:03
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  of, ah, on the campuses, in the cities. We see, let's say for example, we talked about this early about rap music. 

00:41:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:41:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. There are some things a rap music have come in together on some of these issues. 

00:41:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:41:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  There's another, a notion of, of kinda Blacker endow but I don't wanna get that, I don't think that issue is that crude. But it's all kind of a struggling for what is the right kind of identity but by people are very common committed in it. 

00:41:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And there are some people who would say, look, if you take the notion of nationalism for example, which really is being played out as Afrocentristic as the newest version of our, ah, indention of a Black... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...nationalism. It will... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...be different during Garby, be different in Delaney. 

00:41:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure, yeah. 

00:41:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, and again, I don't say that in the pejorative of sense... (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:41:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I'm shall be saying, I think those things are, are related. 

00:41:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Ah, some, some people say, well, we don't, we had time to be bicultural... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or we don't had time to be multicultural. 

00:41:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And there are multi-culturals to say, what do you mean, we don't have time? 

00:41:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This is the reality we live in. 

00:41:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, and I'm not replacing my identity with yours but what do you mean I don't have a, a, a voice here? And then, you have the bicultural who's saying the same kind of thing, where we are these two people... (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:42:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...two clusters of people. 

00:42:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON I'm sure you run into those about who would say that the goal is to have to have this be, ah, race or your Blackness had less salience. 

00:42:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Oh, yeah, and, and, and... (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON And that's an... (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's an. (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...interesting, ah, uhm, position in light of what you're saying here. 

00:42:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I think sometimes those people, though, ah, I, when I read them, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:42:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ah, I think I'm doing justice to Steven Carter... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or Shelby Steele. I don't quite figure out what they do with race when it still exists... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughing). 

00:42:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, when you can still go into, ah, in fact, I would say race conserved, as you know, three functions in our daily life. 

00:42:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, in a person who has a well-developed Black identity... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...it seems to me they have to have three mental functions... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or maps that they have to deal with. One, being Black can be, you have to learn to defend yourself in a racist situation. 

00:42:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

00:42:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, your identity should help you to defend yourself, should function to, ah, act as a protective shield against psychological assault... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...toward being Black... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...kind of our ascription. But it's that everything? No. Ah, one also can say Black this is an internal life. 

00:43:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:43:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That it's, it's, it's culture. It's a, a way of hearing oneself or hearing other people's selves. It's a way of such the preferences, things I like that I would taste, food stuffs, newspapers, books I would buy and so on. How I view my body? Ah, how I view my hair, my lips, my, my feet, my hands and so on. But even there, if we just put those two together the, the function of defensiveness... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and the function of being anchored and connected. That's kinda traditional ethnicity... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and that can lead to real problems. That can lead to an identity where you don't see a relationship to other groups. 

00:43:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's me and they, we and they. Well, how do we explain Malcolm after Mecca? 

00:43:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:43:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. How do we explain... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:43:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...an Angela Davis? 

00:43:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Right. 

00:43:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. How do we explain some of the, some of the biracial people we meet? They seemed to have something else in addition to which is connected to these first two. 

00:43:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:43:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I've chosen for a lack of a better term on the word bridging. An identity must help you to bridge to other experiences with people who are not "yourself," and do not only do in a pragmatic sense 'coz you have to do it, but do really appreciate them in a deeper level in, in their humanity. Their humanity for their ethnicity... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:44:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... for their sense of groupness ah, and how do you make connections, sometimes, at a political level for political alliances but more than that in the case of our friend with the Japanese, that we actually dive into it and you become of part of it. Ah, so, that in a sense, those three parts seem to had to operate in a modern identity, not in all settings. 

00:44:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Let's face it. 

00:44:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. If we were in the community, fulltime. 

00:44:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Having to deal fulltime with police abuse, fulltime with, with the most raw forms of oppression. We may choose to stress maybe two of those things more so than the other. 

00:44:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:44:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But even there, even there, people who are right smack in the middle community often have to negotiate with people not in the community. 

00:44:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:44:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, to have that skill and ability to make some of those bridge, bridging tracks, transactions, in their case, maybe their bridging mode might be a little less developed because they don't need it as much. 

00:45:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON I wanna get into some of my evolution. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, sorry. 

00:45:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughing) Oh, that's great, that's great, but I was gonna... (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:45:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...just ask you if you could, if you could kinda summarize the, the major changes. 

00:45:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:45:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Can you? 

00:45:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That, I, I like that. 

00:45:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:45:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  The major change is, is moving away from self-hatred as a dynamic to this process and more of the issue of, of a, of a differentness in terms of how one has been raised. 

00:45:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, differentness in seeing how race is to be developed. 

00:45:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:45:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And in pre-encounter race usually has less importance. 

00:45:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:45:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  In addition to that, there are some people who are self-hating. 

00:45:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:45:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The rest of the model tends to be basically the same. 

00:45:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:45:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then, when I get to the last stage, what is different is an attempt to try to figure out how it is that people arriving at this new identity, nonetheless, still have differences. 

00:45:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Gotcha. Okay. 

00:45:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then, and then that difference is being played out in a philosophical frame and then also talking about how it functions on a daily basis, through defensiveness, through social anchorage, and bridging. 

00:45:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yep. 

00:45:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Those are my... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

00:45:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...those are things that. (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON All right. That's great. I, I think that, uhm, just to summarize, ah, you know some of the changes and if, if anyone reads a, a current version of the Black Identity Developed Model of mine, they, they know that the stages are not just those four that I'll let, you know. 

00:46:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:46:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON It's not just passive acceptance, active resistance, redirection, and internalization. Actually, now, we've got five stages. (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Five, great. 

00:46:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uhm, because what I did was, I said, well, there is something before acceptance. There is something before I've, in fact, embraced the consciousness of the oppressive. 

00:46:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:46:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON There is something before I have become so immersed in the, the status quo, right? I wasn't always this way. I wasn't born that way. 

00:46:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:46:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON I got them, so what, where was, alright. And so, what we've done is to put in a, a pre a stage before... (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:46:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON  the, ah, acceptance. A pre-acceptance decision. I call, I call it naive, but sometimes I call it no social consciousness. 

00:47:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:47:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON All right. And its the point at which when we're born into this world, we just don't any sense of ourselves... (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:47:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...as members of the social group. 

00:47:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:47:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON We have no social identity. We know when we're hungry. We know when we're wet. 

00:47:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:47:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON We know when we wanna be held. 

00:47:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Oh. 

00:47:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON But that's about it. But, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. When I was a clusters of propensities rather than... (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:47:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to develop. 

00:47:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, right. And there's a lot to be criticized about the doll studies, but one of the things... (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:47:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that it sort of emphasizes is that kids do have some consciousness... (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:47:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  at least by the age of three. 

00:47:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Of color. 

00:47:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, yeah. 

00:47:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And its ranking. (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Whether, right. Whether those studies accurately describes it as a whole other issue. We won't need to go in to it yet. And so, and we all know that little kids see difference. 

00:47:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:47:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON You know, we may not put a judgment or value on that, but they see it, (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

00:47:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON All right. You know, the, the sort of classic supermarket scene... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:47:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...with the little kid says, "Look, Mommy, a Blackman... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. Yeah. 

00:48:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON And I love that," you know, and the, and the man, and the mother says, no, no, don't notice that. 

00:48:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You're right, right. (laughing) 

00:48:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Don't notice that... (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. 'Coz they're reading it as an adult level... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...don't notice that. Right, right... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but you're right. 

00:48:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...right, I mean, and I have to say, no, the kid is right. I am Black. 

00:48:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:48:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON It's okay. 

00:48:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  It's okay. 

00:48:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughing). And uhm, uhm, ah, but at any rate, ah, but it's in, but it's in that encounter. 

00:48:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, kind of an imprinting almost of those. (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Right. The thing that I worry about is that kid has now learned... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:48:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that noticing that or at least verbalizing that... (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:48:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...than, you know, the, the attention to that difference is bad. 

00:48:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:48:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON And then they got to ask, well, that's a, that throws them off. Why is that bad? 

00:48:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:48:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON And then so, now I gotta get a whole lot more data to, you know, to verify this information that this is bad. That, you know, I got from an impor, an important person, my mother. 

00:48:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right, okay. 

00:48:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON You know, and she's not gonna lie to me I think and that's, anyway. We go on and on about that. That's a whole another piece. But the point is that what we have is this, this, this earliest stage of what I call cont, naive, or no social consciousness which doesn't last very long. 

00:49:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:49:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON But it's there. Okay, so now, I got that established. 

00:49:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  In, in a sense, you're saying by that, that when one does a really detailed analysis of this, one, we have to start with early childhood experiences. 

00:49:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes, yes. But the other. (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And maybe, maybe the dollar imprinting doesn't, that the color imprinting doesn't necessarily mean the, the kid hates themselves... (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:49:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but they are imprinted to certain social values... (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

00:49:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...what is given more weight and another. 

00:49:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:49:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:49:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. But it al, and it's also ah, reemphasizes the notion that we weren't born with this stuff. 

00:49:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:49:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON We learned it... 

00:49:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right, right. 

00:49:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...which is important for me because I also wanna get across the notion that we can unlearn it. 

00:49:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:49:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. But, and anyway, so we got, we have that, we have the, the, and when moving to what I call the passive-acceptance, all right. And so, this kid learns his stuff and he get, he or she gets these messages from a lot of other places, this Black child. 

00:49:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:49:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Now, when I used to make presentations to audiences whether they're academic audiences or whoever, verbally, somebody would come up to me, usually a White woman... (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:50:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and say, I really like that model, and I can relate to it, not to that I was Black, obviously, but as a woman. 

00:50:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? And she's, I answer that, it's interesting. I can understand how that could happen. Uhm, but then they'd say, but don't you have people, Black people who actively buy it? 

00:50:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:50:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Who actively collude with their own oppression to these various terms. Hell no get outta here, Black folks don't do that. 

00:50:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Kind, kinda an affirmed of Negroes. (laughing) 

00:50:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. Right. (laughing) 

00:50:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. (laughing). 

00:50:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON And then, and then, uhm, along comes, uhm, the '80s and all of a sudden we find that they are... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:50:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON  the Black folks. Ah, you know, the Clarence Pendletons...(crosstalk) 

00:50:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:50:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and so on and so forth, you know, Clarence Thomas's who, who, they're all Clarences but in anyway... (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:50:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...they sort of buy into this notion... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:51:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that, ah, uhm, 

00:51:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And they're writing about it... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:51:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and they're defending... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, right... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  it's more of defending or actually... (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...right. 

00:51:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...go with theories about it. 

00:51:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. About how we need to pull ourselves up from our boot, by our boot straps... (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:51:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and so on, and so forth, but we're just not good enough and, you know, just really almost actively playing at the self-hatred thing... (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:51:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...you know So, and so, now, and then, okay, alright, there you go. And so, I had to put in this thing co-active... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:51:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON receptors... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:51:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...but reluctantly. But in anyway, so, in awhile... (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Do you, do you still feel that reluctance today or do you find it more. 

00:51:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON (sighs). The reluctance comes from my own sense of Blackness, my own sense of embarrassment... (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Oh, okay. 

00:51:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...my own sense of, of, of pain... (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:51:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...for those folks in our community. They, uhm, not those folks, I don't put them off. Those are us. 

00:51:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:51:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON  You know, with those of, there's a part of us that, ah, where the system of racism and oppression won, if you will... (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:51:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...uhm, or is winning. 

00:51:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, that's important for us to stress just a little bit that as theorist, we can't just put in our models what we like... (crosstalk) 

00:52:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON We want, right, right. 

00:52:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but what, what the folks are actually telling us by the behavior of... (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's right. 

00:52:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...(inaudible ). 

00:52:09
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's right. 

00:52:09
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Like some people would say, "Well, why you don't you call some of this outright self-hatred?" 

00:52:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

00:52:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, I said, while if they're, if they seem happy in other dimensions... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...then I have to use another exa, ah, ah, terms... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Oh, right... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to explain it... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...right, right. 

00:52:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and same with what you're saying, you know. 

00:52:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON I didn't... 

00:52:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yet, they may offend... (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...I didn't want to put that (inaudible ). (crosstalk). 

00:52:21
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...one's personal values... (crosstalk) 

00:52:21
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. 

00:52:21
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...though, because... (crosstalk) 

00:52:21
BAILEY W. JACKSON I'm, I have some allegiance to, to, describing what is. 

00:52:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:52:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...you know, as much as I may not like it. I wanna make sure that it is what it is... (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:52:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...but you know. Okay, so, that's one variation. The other variation of change was at the resistance level. I had people going from passive-acceptance to active resistance. 

00:52:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:52:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON  But I realized that that wasn't always true either. 

00:52:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Huh. 

00:52:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON That not everybody was out there, marching and joining the panthers... (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:52:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and throwing molotov cocktails and taking over administration buildings and one thing or another, that there were some people who were trying to walk the line. 

00:52:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:53:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Who were trying to say, yeah, there's something wrong but, who also got bought by the system. 

00:53:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:53:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON And some of us who got tender in wide institutions and some of us who got big houses and big mortgages and, and are married to our BMWs and a hi-fi system and (laughing)... 

00:53:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. (laughing). 

00:53:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  And who, you know, uhm, 

00:53:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We, we should explain to that. 

00:53:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Was it the. (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, I, I'm on the neurotic about hi-fi equipment, okay? (laughing) 

00:53:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughing) But. 

00:53:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I visit you always after... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's right. 

00:53:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...I go into the... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...after the show. 

00:53:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...after the hi-fi store, right. 

00:53:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:53:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uhm, but uhm, who had some sense gotten hooked. 

00:53:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:53:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON And, ah, so, what we want. (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, even though they are benevolent, they still aren't go whether they. 

00:53:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, right. And it's real hard. I mean, I hold myself up. I mean, I, I worked real hard to get to the, to the level I am and, and, you know, in academic institutions and, I know, the hard part is that I know that to some extent. I colluded... (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:53:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in order to get it and that hurts to think about that. And so, uhm, what I'm saying then is that there was the active-resistance but then there was something I was calling passive-resistance... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:54:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  or might sort of, uhm, fooling around and the description over this, the, the weekend militant. 

00:54:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. (laughing) 

00:54:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughing). That's the person who saw the grins and shuffles on the job... (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:54:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and plays the game, but on the, in the weekend or at night, (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yup. 

00:54:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON  those racisms... (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:54:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and so on, and so, and so, and then we'll go back... (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And play the role. 

00:54:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and play the game, you know, because it's too expensive. I mean, I kid about it but it's a, you know, it's, it's hard and the, and the younger folk or the folks that are not so bored into it, pointed us and say, (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:54:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  you know, you Uncle Tom, why are you wanting another and you just, you know, uhm, in a part of... (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:54:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...the movement over there, without really I think recognizing that, uhm, some of us had been in this so long and it's hard. 

00:54:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:54:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON So, anyway, so, now, we have the passive and active acceptance and we have passive and active resistance. 

00:55:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Resistance. 

00:55:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uhm, I don't think that you get to the next stage from passive-resistance. 

00:55:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:55:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  I think you do it some point after you go to active resistance. An active doesn't mean necessarily violence. 

00:55:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. No, no. 

00:55:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON But it does mean, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Actively being self-required. 

00:55:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. And really sort of grab and hold and sort of being, ah, self-reflective and, and sometimes. 

00:55:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Like you saw me before that if you can't find the persons' retrospective view of themselves, some evidence of them, them having gone from a passivity to a reactive mode, you question whether or not... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Whether or not they vary... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...if they gone be... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...done that... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...gone through and not did any change. 

00:55:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...done the work. Right. Otherwise, they're just dragging along the... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:55:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ... the negative stuff. 

00:55:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:55:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. The next level is the, the redefinition which hasn't changed very much. 

00:55:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay, all right. 

00:55:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON And so, although the remaining, the reclaiming... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:55:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and so, and the internalization hasn't changed that much. I think one of the things that has changed, ah, again, is an, is a, uhm, a finer description of the stages. Within each stage, I think there are sub-stages. Now you talked about this at the beginning to some extent. I think within each stage has a point at which I enter the stage. 

00:56:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:56:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON I'm sort of trying on these lenses. 

00:56:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:56:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON I'm trying on this consciousness. There's a point at which I fully adopted it. I've got to suit on. It's me. 

00:56:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON I am, in fact, the active-resistor. I am in fact the passive-acceptor, and then there's a point in which I exit. 

00:56:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:56:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON I began to question that consciousness and began to move into another consciousness. And it's that point at which I'm lee, I've got my foot almost in both... (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:56:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that, ah, that I'm in transition. 

00:56:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? And that, it was one of the things that we've talked about a lot is that, is that your, uhm, ah, I guess it's your encounter. There's the point at which a, a pre-encounters, the point at which we, and so, to say, yes, this is wrong, but I'm not really ready to immerse... (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, right. 

00:56:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...myself into the other and I'm going back and forth and people look at me and I look crazy... (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and schizophrenic because I'm holding on... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:57:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to some values over here but I'm cursing them over there uhm, and that's the way I help, helps me understand that. 

00:57:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:57:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Because I think my stages what they are, are sort of snapshots of a moving picture. 

00:57:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:57:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Alright? There're snapshots of, uhm, where a person is at each stage. 

00:57:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:57:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON  And what the substages do is allow me to sort of make the picture move a little more... (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Hmm. 

00:57:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...is to make me instant, to make it clear about how the person moves into a stage, through the stage... (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:57:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...out of the stage, into the next stage, and also to acknowledge that that's a traumatic. 

00:57:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:57:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON It's almost, you know, a sort of I think Kubler-Ross's work on death and dying helped me understand the power of that because I'm letting go ones, one me... (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:57:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and I'm being born a whole another me. I mean, I don't think that's overstating the experience of moving from stage to stage. 

00:58:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, you know, what's interesting of, ah, although you can find elements of this sub-stage, in some of my stages, I think you've been expressing your more recent, ah, work last five years or so. 

00:58:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:58:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You've been arguing that this is true apparently for all the stages... (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON All the stages, yeah. 

00:58:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and where this picked up, I think empirically it's in the work of Thomas Parham and Janet Helms. They went from trying to cluster people... (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to a notion that actually people, no matter what stage they are in, they may have various degrees of traits... (crosstalk) 

00:58:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:58:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...of the stages... (crosstalk) 

00:58:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. Right. 

00:58:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  and that what makes you...(crosstalk) 

00:58:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. 

00:58:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in stage is something kind of predominating... (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

00:58:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but it's not the total absence of something. 

00:58:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes. 

00:58:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's the predominance or something. I think that's more consistent with what I... (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes. 

00:58:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...believe coz you, you make it possible for some of these things to kinda be ever present. 

00:58:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yup. 

00:58:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And what makes you in a stage is what is the more dominant issue. 

00:58:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, right. 

00:58:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's interesting because that might, I don't know if it's gonna happen but it maybe that this distinction I make between internalization versus the internalization commitment... (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  really could be just say, in internalization... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

00:58:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that when it's new, the issue is on if you can come with it, if being a part of you. And as it matures, it can lead to a, a greater commitment to, ah, issues and groups outside of the self. It becomes less of a psychological model and more of a community or cultural model. And you see I'm trying to do... (crosstalk) 

00:59:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:59:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...some depthlessly. Well, go ahead, I need to look at that. 

00:59:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Let's, let's look them fade a little bit. 

00:59:15
Current Issues in Cultural Identity Theory 

00:59:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  So, uhm, what we've done so far is to kinda talk about how, how were we started, some of the stuffs that's brought us up... (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to the present. Before we sort of jump into the future and start with other things which I think we still are hoping these models would do... (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:59:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...or things that we wanna continue to play with, there's a sort of transition to that. I wanna, one of the things that, uhm, I find ah, really intriguing that I've been doing playing with now which leads into the future is this notion of what I call social justice and social diversity. Ah, as you know, the day that the big word is diversity. 

01:00:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:00:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right? And it's used, ah, I think, and abused and throwing around quite loosely. Uhm, for me, it's important to use the term social diversity so, it's not, it's clear we're not talking about individual personality... (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:00:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...differences. Uhm, which by the way, you may wanna come back and talk about your, your own model... (crosstalk) 

01:00:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...into this, you know, self-concept of FBI's or our jail. But, uhm, the, ah, the social diversity and then there's a social justice which is, you know, dealing with issues of racism. And so, the context of these models, the social diversity, it talks about our race, our culture. (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:00:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? And the social diversity talks about racism, indiscrimination, injustice, and inequality; equality, inequality issues. Now, it's interesting to me when I use those terms, social justice and social diversity and then, ah, you apply them to our models. For me, our models talked about, at least mine, focuses primarily on social justice issues. 

01:01:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:01:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? In some sense, it was born out of an attempt to understand how our identities or influence by our living in a racist society, or living in race, racist experience and how we are naive to that, (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

01:01:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON How we accept, let's give in as impromptu to that, how we resist that. How we redefine ourselves... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...okay, and how we internalize that new identity, alright? But in some sense, the driving force is racism. And now, the problem, though, is for me, although, I don't think that's valid. 

01:01:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:01:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON The problem is that it doesn't really capture all of my experience. I am not Black because of racism break, okay? Uhm, ah, racism is part of my experience but that's not my, that's not how I define myself. 

01:02:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You're not defined... (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Really, by... (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...by racism. 

01:02:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...by racism. 

01:02:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:02:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON It shapes my identity. 

01:02:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:02:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON But it has not defined me. There's something else, okay? And that something else is the culture. The something else is that what's falls under that Rubik(ph) for the term social diversity. Now, so, what I would like to, and this is in the, moving into my... (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:02:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...future piece is, uhm, to do more work and I have some, some beginning thoughts about this, about how we talk about, ah, the way that our understanding of who we are that comes from our heritage, that comes from our, our, our philosophy as a group of people, our theology as a group of people, our, our economy, if you will... (crosstalk) 

01:02:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes, right. 

01:02:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...as a group of people. Uhm, how that influences just who we are. Who are we independent of racism... (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:02:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON  independent of oppression? 

01:02:55
WILIAM E. CROSS JR. Right. 

01:02:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON What's my sense of self? What is, what is Afrocentrism? See, ah, one of the things you'd mentioned the Afrocentrism before, one of the things that I have trouble with in, uhm, in the way people talk about or describe what it's all about is that they, they're doing more of the same. 

01:03:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:03:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON They're talking about, ah, the experience of racism without talking about what it means... (crosstalk) 

01:03:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It means to be. 

01:03:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to be Afrocentric to have, uhm, ah, the, the uhm, the values and... (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Frame of reference... (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...the frame of reference... (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to the real people. 

01:03:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...that comes from my African heritage... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:03:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...if you will, uhm, as part of the mix. There's a more dominant piece of mix. And so, that's what I'm hoping to do. I'm hoping to, in some sense, bring a new layer to the model. I'm hoping, you know, you just make transition or, or leave it this way. One of the things I realized that if there were no racism... (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:03:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...there might not be an acceptance stage and there might not be a resistance stage but there would still be a definition stage. It wouldn't be redefinition. 

01:04:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:04:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON There would be a definition and an internalization, okay? And so, because I would still need to go from naive... (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:04:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ... or no social consciousness to understanding who I... (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:04:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...was as a Black or African-American person, right. (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, independent of Whites. 

01:04:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Independent of Whites. (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:04:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right? And that's thedefinition. Now, because we have to do that in an oppressive environment and then in the form of oppression or the manifestation of oppression being racism... (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:04:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in this case, uhm, we have these other stages that we have to move through... (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
WIILLIAM E. CROSS JR. Right. 

01:04:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in order to get back to, uhm, and the other thing I'd like to add is that while I was in acceptance? I learned about Black heroes and heroines. 

01:04:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:04:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON I, when I was a kid, I went to what we used to call Negro History classes... (crosstalk) 

01:04:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's right. 

01:04:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and then Community. They were not in the schools because I grew up in the North, not in the South, and there was a Black woman in our neighborhood who used to teach kids about Harry Tubman and Sir Gerry Matruth and Frederick Douglas, things we didn't get in the New York City School System, okay? Uhm, all we got was Booker T. Washington and... (crosstalk) 

01:05:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

01:05:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and, and uhm, ah, George Washington in the car if we were lucky. 

01:05:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:05:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right? Uhm, but that was it. And so, I got some sense that, hey, we did do some other things. 

01:05:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, that when you rediscover, it's not like you had to clean slate that you had to build. (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. 

01:05:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In some ways as a reconnecting with things... (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON With the reconnecting. 

01:05:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that you did or (inaudible )or not seeing the importance. 

01:05:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, and I, then I went about having to embellish the stuff that I'd gotten, the little that I had gotten... (crosstalk) 

01:05:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:05:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...growing up. 

01:05:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But, you know, what you make me think off of when, ah, I married, part of the process would being accepted by, My family was to have an encounter with, ah, Nanny, (crosstalk) 

01:05:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:05:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ah, Nanny, ah, who still, still with us. She's getting close to 90, (crosstalk) 

01:05:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:05:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. was my wife's, ah, is my wife's, ah, grandmother. Uhm, and anyway, Nanny, ah, was described for me as a person who had discovered God recently or, you know, not recently, but ah, 10, 15 years. But before that time, she was a blues singer. Ah, she was married to a fellow whose name was Cowboy. So, you can imagine now it couldn't that, ah, picture that. And then when I met her, she was like, ah, an ebony hued. She was a five by five by five by five. I mean, she was a round ball. She had a, a wig that was kind of not quite on her head but I was forewarned not to refer to her as Black. 

01:06:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:06:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That she referred to herself as Colored... (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and so on. I mean, here, you had a person, therefore, who was the epitome of Black culture, Black anthropology or whatever you wanna call it.(crosstalk) 

01:06:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yep, yep, yep. 

01:06:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But who reflected on it differently than I would have reflected on. 

01:06:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And I, to me, that's what you maybe think of. 

01:06:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

01:06:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And in fact, can't we say we talked about this before that any point in the notion of the stages that most Black people had at least two experiences around the race. Most Black people have two experiences around the race. Race as a ascription... (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:07:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, and race as an inner, inner voice or a culture. If you will, there's a part of that if you are Black, you may and likely do experiences the fact that other people have problems with you're being Black. It's not your problem but they, they make... (crosstalk) 

01:07:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sort of. 

01:07:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...their racism are problem for you. They impose on it. 

01:07:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

01:07:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And therefore, in some ways, I, I learned to, to know about race through this reacting to their problem. Ah, in the worst case scenario, you know, kind of a brutal racism, in other words, mild discriminations, but still it's an imposition... (crosstalk) 

01:07:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

01:07:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and in a sense that is race. But that is not all that race is. I mean, that's almost like describing one's Jewishness by what, an anti-semitism. 

01:07:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. Right. 

01:07:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But you can't say anti-semitism... (crosstalk) 

01:07:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

01:07:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...isn't important. 

01:07:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

01:07:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And this, there's this other part, the food ah, there's the nanny, there's the song, there's the blues, there's the music, there's the, ah, corporate, corporal punishment by our, our fathers, okay (laughing), which was not child abuse but void... (crosstalk) 

01:07:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Yep, yeah, (laughing). 

01:08:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...this thing, right? Uhm, there was a sense of walking down a community and if you were two block, two or three blocks away and you start acting out Mrs. Peaches(ph) would stick her head out as if she was your aunt and tell you if you keep it up... (crosstalk) 

01:08:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON (inaudible ). 

01:08:13
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and so, in a sense, there was this community. 

01:08:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:08:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, you know, ironically, along the way, the way we were educated in the formal educational institutions, that experience would almost, not be totally repressed but delegitimized. 

01:08:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes. 

01:08:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Delegitimized. We, we've talked about how this Black scours. We've had to get reconnected, not to something totally new... (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but something it was kinda buried beneath some crust and that maybe our models had been, ah, powerful in, in the academic world. In part, because we were not starting instantly from scratch... (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...we were doing a reconnection, and I think that's crucial to, to make because independent to our models, one has to realize Blackness is a part of, of racism... (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yep. 

01:08:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but it's also something greater. 

01:08:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yep. 

01:08:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And yet, if you just deal with one or the other, you can miss the point. If you take the notion of, of, of, of culture and only deal with culture and only deal with values and don't engage power, then, that's not enough. But likewise, if you only engage issues of power, you do it from the point of view of stigma. 

01:09:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:09:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  You can end up not having, you can have Howell ring to it. 

01:09:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

01:09:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You know? 

01:09:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah. That's great. What. 

01:09:15
Extensions of Cultural Identity Theory: 1. With other cultural groups 2. A growing/changing model 

01:09:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Okay. The two other points, I think, or the two points so we could pick up one now. 

01:09:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:09:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON  One is, uhm, the applications of our models by other people... (crosstalk) 

01:09:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  That's been so exciting, I don't know, but for you, it's... (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:09:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that's been a partial... (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Well. (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...regeneration for me. (crosstalk) 

01:09:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughing). 

01:09:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...I know it has been you produce them (inaudible ) 

01:09:36
BAILEY W. JACKSON Oh, yes, sure I mean, in doctor students and, ah, as a result of other presentations but primarily in, in supervising, ah, doctor students who have done, ah, really some fine work, uhm, just to acknowledge a couple of these, ah, ah, Jin Kim, a Korean woman who uhm, several years ago did a Asian Identity Development Theory and in fact won, ah, a national award for her dissertation, her work uhm, by an American, ah, an Asian-American group. Uhm, then there was, uhm, Andrea Canda, Candell(ph) who did her work on Jewish Identity Development. 

01:10:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:10:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Again, uhm, based on, uhm, the work that I've done and your work. Uhm, there had been a couple of uhm, students, a, ah, Roberta Harold who did her work around, ah, gay and lesbian issues. Now, she didn't develop a model per se but what she did was use a lot of those models to develop curriculum... (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Oh, okay. 

01:10:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...for teaching to what she calls "Heterosexism" in the classroom... (crosstalk) 

01:10:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:10:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and helping them. Uhm, and most recently, and I can go on and on, but most recently, uhm, there's a, a study done by Charmaine Wijeyesinghe, who is a, uhm, who looks like an African-American woman, but she is, uhm, ah, Asian-American and Dutch, uhm, and she was influenced by our work again and it, her, uhm, study on Biracial Identity Development, which as you know is really timely because there's a lot more as it were, biracial people are now coming out as biracial people and, ah, sort of a fighting the, the notion that they have to be defined by either the Black parent or the White parent... (crosstalk) 

01:11:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:11:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...depending on what they look like and what they can get away with, and whatever. (crosstalk) 

01:11:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, where the implications are actually rejecting on... (crosstalk) 

01:11:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right, (crosstalk) 

01:11:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and instead they... (crosstalk) 

01:11:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right and they're saying: "I don't wanna have to reject my mom or my dad." (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

01:11:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON In their experience, I want, I am the son or daughter of both my mom and my dad and I wanna be a, uhm, Irish-American, African-American, whatever, okay? Uhm, and so what Charmaine did was to pull together a, uhm, at least, I think a beginning of a way of thinking about Biracial Identity Development and then she would say it still got some ways to go but she, I think she made a really fine depth in that and has really, ah, pushed our own work. 

01:12:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:12:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON I was pushed, uhm, I directed again to this study, but hmm, some of the things that she was saying about our stuff... (crosstalk) 

01:12:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

01:12:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...in her work, gave me pause... (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

01:12:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to come back and say: "Yes. Our models are monoracial models." Okay? Ah, and what she was saying is, yes, they are helpful. 

01:12:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  But they don't apply. 

01:12:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Ah, but they, but maybe we need a whole different frame... (crosstalk) 

01:12:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:12:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to, ah, to come at the experience of biracial peoples. 

01:12:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Now, it's not an accident that you, at the University of Massachusetts, have produced these students... (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:13:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and I don't mean to embarrass you but I think it's an important point that I want you to articulate and that is while there are some other distinct, very distinguished scholars in our field of multicultural counseling, (crosstalk) 

01:13:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm uh hmm. 

01:13:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...who have wrestled with how could we come up with a single model... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:13:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. to amalgamate maybe as to negative but put it altogether. You've taken a different tact. 

01:13:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:13:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So it's no accident that these students worked under you. Could you talk about that? 

01:13:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. I, I, I've never quite accepted the notion that we could come up with a, a Minority Identity Development model as well, which is funny because, ah, Rita Hardiman, who came up with a White Identity Development model, uhm, and her work is quite, you know, well known, I think. Uhm, she doesn't write as much as she should either, but (laughs) it's out there and it was based on some of the work of, ah, Jim Edler... (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:13:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...who was, did some work before her, and, but, uhm, we, she and I did collaborate on, ah, some theories of oppression coz we teach directly to issues of oppression. And so we're not just talking about race, but we're talking about gender and we're talking about sexual orientation, we're talking about class, (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

01:14:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON We're talking about, ah, disability/ability, we're talking about age and, and so on. Uhm, ah, as manifestations of, we are looking on how those things can define in an oppressive system and just what oppression is all about. (Sigh) and in that, we began playing around with the model of the oppressor and the oppressed. But we get, we get real careful... (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

01:14:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...about trying to say that these models can be used to explain the experience of Latinos... (crosstalk) 

01:14:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh-huh. 

01:14:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and explain the experience of lesbians, to explain the experience of heterosexuals, to explain the experience of Gentiles or Jews, or older folk, or whatever. Uhm, we need to be careful not to try to pull of coz those exp, while there are some similarities, and the way the different forms of oppression manifest themselves, there are also some very important differences. 

01:15:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:15:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Okay? And so we need to be very careful about trying to build and/or adopt, I think a sort of one-model fits all (laughs), (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:15:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Kind of, ah, ah, approach. 

01:15:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You know, that makes me feel, think about is that, ah, you know, in my work, I, I argue that worse ethnicity can lead to rigid boundaries, conflicts, the worst case scenario being, ah, what we see to, on a more minor scale in New York City, ah, ah, around certain groups, and other parts of the country as well, (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, Uh-huh. 

01:15:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And on a very vicious level in Bosnia. (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, Uh hmm. 

01:15:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Ah, Muslim-Christian, ah, ah, conflict. Nonetheless, ethnicity doesn't have to be so, ah, in, ah, rigid in these boundaries... (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. 

01:15:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that in can, your own ethnicity can become a bridge and a window onto understanding of the, the greater humanities in which you're not always a part of... (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:16:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  as to say, you're, you're, you're human, but your humanity isn't explained being Italian. Your humanity isn't explained. You had to listen and be receptive to air messages. (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, Yeah. 

01:16:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And in a sense, I like the way you're saying that you discover some of the universals, not by short circuiting those experiences, but by studying them...(crosstalk) 

01:16:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes. 

01:16:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...by coming up with your own notes somewhere of the connections, but by constantly going back and forth between what your notion is, of being a human being and how it gets played out the different textures of these experiences. Uhm, I, I think that's very important, and I don't, I don't think that's to stop other people from, or denigrate other people from trying to codify these more ubiquitous tendencies, but I think, it's worth saying that these are delivered reason why you've, you've coached and didn't say leader. (crosstalk) 

01:16:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Fined. Yeah. Right. Each group needs to do its own work... (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, yeah. 

01:16:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...and, ah, that's the real key. Well, let's get, bringing, uhm, let's come to the future, ah, not to the future, to the present. 

01:16:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:16:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uhm, and around these models and look at the sort of implications to say, what are these models do for us today? 

01:17:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Today. Yeah, it's interesting. Sometimes, I'm intimidated by that question because I'm thinking again of the, sometimes, (coughs) more or less, occurring, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:17:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON (inaudible ) 

01:17:17
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...a much or hyper-segregated, hyper-oppressed, ah, segments. On the other hand, when I step back and, ah, become less defensive and just simply say, not as a way of distancing, but really reflecting on this. 

01:17:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:17:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I, I see the model alive and well in all segments of the Black community. 

01:17:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:17:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I was talking to Rita Hardiman, ah, this, ah, morning before we came in for taping and she was saying how isn't it intriguing where, with the rap music, you can almost analyze people who are almost going through a process of change or... (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:17:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...going through a fantasy of confrontations. Ah, you can always maybe use the notion of the, ah, discourse around what Black Hood should do with police or how it... (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

01:17:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...should act on them, is similar to what we talked about this "Kill Whitey" fantasies... (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yap, yap, yap. 

01:17:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that, that is a way of doing what kind of revvings oneself up for what? Well, maybe not necessarily for attack in the, in the more traditional violent sense... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:18:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but attack on the systems... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:18:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...finding of ways... (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:18:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to crush them, finding of ways to make them less affected. Likewise, I can jump up to, ah, some of the middle class situation, scenarios where we do consulting an industry and we can see the same kinds of things, but not the same kinds of things, but some of the issues playing out. Ah, you do this all the time. Ah, I'll just give you an example. I know you'll amplify as well, the finding of people who are in White America... (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:18:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...their corporations... (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:18:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...they like it. At the same time, they don't wanna be perceived as being an Uncle Tom or a traitor or whatever, and they haven't done all these time integrating this... (crosstalk) 

01:18:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

01:18:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...because they're using two, either Irish or Romanic view of these two dimensions. 

01:18:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:18:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I'll be going to a conference tomorrow. The whole day is, is, is focusing on that. So the people are trying to figure out, well, how do you bridge? How do you make the connection? 

01:18:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:18:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. How do you remain real? Ah, those, I, I take it very much applies... (crosstalk) 

01:18:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:18:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...even within our own group... (crosstalk) 

01:18:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:18:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, and across all classes. I don't think this is a middle class, ah, set of models. It can be if you use it in certain way... (crosstalk) 

01:19:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:19:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...but I don't think it has to be. 

01:19:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. Which gets to the old issue of class. I mean, with, with, particularly, with there, being more class diversity in the Black community. Ah, so I sometimes have to step back and say, "Hmm, ah, are our models really paying enough attention to that?" 

01:19:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:19:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Our models, ah, paying enough attention to what's happening in the South Central LA's. 

01:19:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:19:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON In the, in the South Bronx, and, and so on coast-to-coast kind of thing. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

01:19:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Black and White crime. 

01:19:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Drive-by shootings... (crosstalk) 

01:19:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Shootings. 

01:19:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...like the whole thing. I mean, this is what is that, what's going on? Uhm, ah, the teen pregnancies, the absentee fathers, and, you know? Uhm, ah, I don't know. I, you know, help me, talk to me about how you will sense that, I mean.(crosstalk) 

01:19:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, I, I'll talk to you. I just, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna jump right to what I call the symptoms. (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure. 

01:19:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. (inaudible ) to assume... (crosstalk) 

01:19:56
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

01:19:56
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...because that's exactly what the media does. 

01:19:56
BAILEY W. JACKSON There you go. 

01:19:56
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They make it appears, though, ah, first, first of all, let's, let us say some of these indicators of what circle, what's going on in our community, they are real. (crosstalk) 

01:20:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:20:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So we're not denying the reality of them. 

01:20:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:20:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But I think it's so important for us to keep a historical perspective. (crosstalk) 

01:20:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON So. 

01:20:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You study the Irish, when they were mired in poverty in the United States. They had high crime rates. They had high rates of prostitution. This applies to, ah, some of the tensions between German Jews, and Eastern-European Jews. 

01:20:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:20:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, each, most of Eastern European Jews came in, in the turn of the century. Again, the Purple Gang in Detroit was essentially a Jewish gang. Ah, they were drive-bies around, ah, the prohibition period... (crosstalk) 

01:20:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:20:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...by Italians, by Jews, by Greeks, and so on. So in the sense, poverty... (crosstalk) 

01:20:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:20:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...seems to, ah, ah, be bedfellows for activities that sometimes the middle class is serene by and offended by and so on. And if you don't only look at the surface level, you can make it peculiar to any one group. 

01:20:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

01:20:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You know, the Italian-Americans, for the longest time, had to deal with, "Are they inherently criminalistic because of the mafia." 

01:20:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yap, yap, yap. 

01:20:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, ah, there could be, ah, more contemporary example, are Chicanos and Blacks, ah, more prone to un-American values because of how they're living their lives. I think the fact, the fact of the matter is this is driven by issues of economics. 

01:21:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:21:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And before we get to the issues of race identity, we have to talk about people being so alienated by their disengagement from economic forces so they don't even have the money to give to church, to give to community, to act out on certain kinda social values, that it even appears as though it could reach to such depths that a person will rip off not another Black person but another person because of a jacket... (crosstalk) 

01:21:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:21:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...because of the shoes, and sometimes could be done by self hatred, sometimes, I think the greater force is not so much self-hatred, but an absolute disconnection from any other... (crosstalk) 

01:21:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:21:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...other than maybe a gang, if you will. What that, that gang becomes a family that becomes a community and I think it's so important for us to understand that, that's not the cure to us. I'm not making excuses for our, our community coz we suffered in front of it. It's mostly Blacks are being killed. It's mostly, ah, our own properties as meager as it is which destroy 

01:22:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON But, but, but come, if we can back to the term you used earlier, as salience... (crosstalk) 

01:22:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  You know. 

01:22:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...race ah, and, and alienation. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

01:22:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In a sense. (crosstalk) 

01:22:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  I just wonder, I wonder how much all the economic thing not withstanding. (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:22:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Ah, the economic forces or the lack of access... (crosstalk) 

01:22:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:22:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...to, ah, jobs and, and other kinds of things that we need to survive. But I think one or the other things we need to survive is a sense of, of connection, a sense of identity. Uhm, and, uhm, I, I wonder if some of our are kids in the street or whatever, are, haven't lost that. I don't, and they really don't have that. I don't, well, the salience is not there. 

01:22:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I think the answer is yes and no. 

01:22:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. 

01:22:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The answer is in the real time since today, the answer is yes, they've lost it. 

01:22:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:22:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay? And in the absence of an intervention... (crosstalk) 

01:22:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...they may never show the capacity to, to reconnect with the traditional. 

01:22:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  This, the view of understanding, ah, what such groups as the nation as long do? 

01:23:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:23:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I mean, they take people who essentially are fundamentally alienated, not only from White society, but quite frankly from Blacks society. 

01:23:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON And that was (inaudible ). 

01:23:12
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. And they quote-unquote "convert" them back, if you will, or reconnect them. Now, I'm not saying that's the only model, I just used that as a real time example. I think that the, ah, one has to remember that if there's intervention, a social movement, ah, ah, in the case of Malcolm X, he had to hit rock bottom... (crosstalk) 

01:23:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:23:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, in, in, in the pits and in, in, in the, in the, ah, prison in order to be vulnerable to connection, but things can happen across people that reconnected. 

01:23:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:23:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So even the most extreme people can be reconnected but, yes, they are disconnected. 

01:23:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:23:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Secondly, there are people, however, who are walking around with both sets of values. 

01:23:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:23:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And they will tell you in front of and when, when you interview them that, yes, I know about the potential beauty of Black people. I know about that, but how is that gonna put bread in my plate? (crosstalk) 

01:23:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:23:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Or, what else am I to do? And so they will still judge. So in a sense, they're in a, they're in a kind of a quandary as Wade Boykin would say. 

01:24:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON So. 

01:24:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. The thing that I think we had to keep in mind in real, I think, really good social activists are all about, they're wrestling with how do you reconnect people who are in fact, disconnected, but also, how do you make a connection with the community so you can give more weight to the pre-existing traditional values... (crosstalk) 

01:24:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Yes. 

01:24:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and give less weight... (crosstalk) 

01:24:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes. 

01:24:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...to the competing ones. So in that sense, it's a more hopeful notion. There are people who you don't have to reconnect, you have to fence there to give them a playground where their traditional frames of reference have more weight. I, frankly, say, this may sound too good and I'm not a knee-jerk Marxist. You provide a more healthy economic climate for even some of the worst of Black communities. They themselves will impart solve their own problems. 

01:24:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:24:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. By that, I mean, once they're connected economically... (crosstalk) 

01:24:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:24:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  they all ready have the internal culture and resources to reconnect. 

01:24:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:24:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But in the absence of an economic reconnection, very few of them will reconnect... (crosstalk) 

01:24:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:24:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and they'll almost, in some cases, be driven to a point of an alienisms that we don't recognize them... (crosstalk) 

01:25:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:25:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and that's where, in fact, as you put it, the drive-by and so on, we can't recognize that. 

01:25:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:25:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's not a traditional part of Black culture. That's how I. 

01:25:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. You know, I, I, I agree. I think that, uhm, (sighs) it's, uhm, it's a, it's a funny there's a dilemma in there. Uhm, there's the alienation, uhm, I think the ah. (crosstalk) 

01:25:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's all like an extreme purged version of our first stages... (crosstalk) 

01:25:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. Right. (crosstalk) 

01:25:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...extreme, for example, disconnection of anything. (crosstalk) 

01:25:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. There's, there's some funny kinda contradictions because if you at the media, for example, they would have these kids be very black. 

01:25:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. 

01:25:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? I mean, they wear their red, black and green leathers and the medallions with mother Africa and so on and so forth. But the thing that, that, uhm, ah, I don't think people understand is that, I, sometimes, I see that as Alaska, Aspen, cold and warm, I wanna be connected. But on the other side, there's like chasing this American dream that is a, that's not only, is no longer a dream deferred, it's a dream denied. Uhm, uhm, and but the, they're chasing after it, the BMWs, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the, what do you call it, the portable phones, and the beepers and all that, are all pieces of the, of the, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:26:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Or they become, with this rather that, not or but and they become with this rather, I think we're saying the shower definition of blackness in culture. 

01:26:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

01:26:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  They're very preview to scapegoating. 

01:26:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Hmm. 

01:26:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They're very preview to say, ah, ah, blackness is something that we can package very, readily over here. Blackness is not that, and then, ah, that, that makes it very easy to scapegoat other groups. I'm not gonna get into the whole legitimate debate that's going on between Blacks and Jews. (crosstalk) 

01:26:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:26:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Between Blacks and other groups. But in some cases, that can feed to a simplistic analysis of some of these conflicts where the issue is to be a ghetto... (crosstalk) 

01:26:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:26:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...ah, and of course, some more crude cases, ah, where, in fact, ah, if, if they look a certain way, it's okay to do certain things to them. 

01:27:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Sure, sure. 

01:27:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But, of course, in the Black, again we have to remind ourselves and the, and the things that are happening in our communities, often Whites are, are the, the least likely to be affected. 

01:27:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON So. 

01:27:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It is the people in our own community and that's where we know that the alienation is deeper than just race. 

01:27:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:27:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It is, it is within race. 

01:27:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON And, may it well fade out. 

01:27:15
Conclusion 

01:27:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  You know, there, there, we hope of course that a number of audiences will, will, will have access to this film. 

01:27:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:27:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But certainly, we can pretty well bet that many people in, who are practicing, who are social workers. (crosstalk) 

01:27:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Helping professions. 

01:27:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Helping professions will be there. Uhm, and I think maybe we should make some final comments, uhm, to them in particular. What would be your thoughts as you might make some final comments to addressing that... (crosstalk) 

01:27:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:27:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... and helping people in helping profession? 

01:27:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Since the primary reason we're here, well, when we got here was around that models. Uhm, I wanna hark in back to some concerns I had, what the most, what, I mean, I mean, 20, 25 years ago... (crosstalk) 

01:28:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's been a long time then. (crosstalk) 

01:28:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...it's been that long. And that is uhm, ah, recognizing that while people in the helping professions are, were always looking for ways of making sense of what's happening with our client, consumer, helpee(ph), and these models can be sort of lenses from beginning to understand what's going on. But I think that uhm, ah, we need to be real careful about how we use these stages. Ah, the thing, and one of my big fears, was that the model would be used to pigeonhole people, to label them, you know? You are pre-encountered. You'll no longer be across. You're pre-encountered. Right? (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:28:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON And so, ah, and that's how I'm gonna deal with you. And not only you're pre-encountered here, around this issue, that's your whole life. (crosstalk) 

01:28:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:28:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON That's how you see the world, or I'm an active resistance and that's how I see the world. Well, none of us, at least the way I think about it, none of us are in any one of those stages totally. 

01:29:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

01:29:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON We're in all of them. Now we have a dominant stage, a way we view the world most of the time, okay? But we do have, I mean, in me, I mean, this time when my resistance classes are on... (crosstalk) 

01:29:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:29:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON  and you watch me and you say, "By that golly, that Bailey Jackson, he is an act of resistance." But then you'll see me in another environment or in another context and you'll say, "No, no, no. He's passive acceptance." Or you'll see in another environment and you'll say, "No, no he's a reader." The truth is, is that all, all of those are me. 

01:29:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:29:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay? So what does the helper do? The helper has to deal with, I think, what they have in front of them, the presenting person, the presenting problem, the presenting stage of consciousness, if you will. But be very careful, it's kinda like I wanna put a warning label... (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:29:50
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...on these models. Uhm, use with caution. Use with, ah, in gentle doses. The other thing I think people ought to help, those in the helping professions need to understand, is that it's not just the person that you're working with who is, has one of these stages, you do too. 

01:30:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

01:30:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON And so, if we're working together and you're the helper and I'm the helpee, it's not just Bailey is in whatever stage but you are viewing me from the stage you're in... (crosstalk) 

01:30:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:30:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON ...which is gonna influence what you're saying. 

01:30:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

01:30:25
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. And so, sometimes. (crosstalk) 

01:30:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You mean you're having yourself reflective on these issues. (crosstalk) 

01:30:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

01:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You may be imposing on, on the person. (crosstalk) 

01:30:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON You could be dangerous. 

01:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

01:30:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Okay. And so, I think the key is for us to understand as helpers where we are and to constant reflect, to constantly grapple with and grow with, as it where, where we are with these stages and I think that will help us see more clearly where the helpee is and deliver the kind of service, uhm, that makes it more sensible(ph). 

01:30:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In some ways my concluding remarks speed off on that. 

01:31:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:31:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, they're both connected in a, in, in, in elaboration of that. You know, my work I've made recently, a, a, a distinction in a recent years is, ah, I've emphasized the distinction between personal identity and reference group orientation or a group identity. (crosstalk) 

01:31:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right, right. 

01:31:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And now on my lectures I often say we have to understand that black people are tremendously diverse group. They vary in their personal identities tremendously and they vary in their group identities. And in particular, kind of fondling this to the issue of the helping profession, you may have a client that come in and at first you could swear, that what has brought them there, they may even announce that the reason why they are there is because they're having problems with their voice... (crosstalk) 

01:31:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:31:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...with their frame of refuge with their value system. 

01:31:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh-huh. 

01:31:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I don't mean to suggest it, they might not be having some problems. But then, when they're there for awhile, you discover that maybe they were abused when they were younger or something is going on that's, when I say deeper it's not to trivialize(ph) the, ah, issue of group identity but deeper in a psycho-analytic sense... (crosstalk) 

01:32:00
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:32:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...instead, instead of more fundamental core. It's probably not only affecting their group identity. 

01:32:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:32:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But affecting other situations and group identity even isn't, ah, salient. 

01:32:10
BAILEY W. JACKSON Right. 

01:32:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I think it's crucial that as much as we write about him, written about him, devoted our life to the issue of group identity dynamics that we're talking about a person who is fundamentally a human being, whose group identity is their cultural texture, their clothing. But beneath that we have to ask the question how they put, been put together as a human being, you know, what is their level of self-esteem? (crosstalk) 

01:32:30
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

01:32:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Is it being totally driven by their group identity or are there some other pieces that's got laid in their kinda not quite right... (crosstalk) 

01:32:40
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:32:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in, before the group identity issue kinda got connected in. And if we understand this issue of diversity at the group identity level and at the personal identity level... (crosstalk) 

01:32:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:32:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and that people coming in, they say they're troubled by one thing. And then our, our, our obligation is to use all our sensitive tools to kinda probe and see if that's the case. 

01:32:55
BAILEY W. JACKSON Uh hmm. 

01:32:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. If it's a value thing, we use one set of strategies. On the other hand, if we discover that maybe in fact, they're better off in their values than we realize. And what's truly troubling them is another level. In that sense, that's the same way of saying, "Don't label." (crosstalk) 

01:33:05
BAILEY W. JACKSON  Yeah. 

01:33:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Don't, don't make this issue stage be predominant thing. Look at the, look at the whole person and in a sense, use your skills accordingly. 

01:33:15
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:33:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And while we certainly have devoted, ah, almost a lifetime, - 

01:33:20
BAILEY W. JACKSON (laughs) 

01:33:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. - 20-25 years to the importance of group identity, we don't think this overrides the, becoming very, very confident skilled with handling people who are just simply troubled, for reasons that may not have to do with race, that may have to do with something else, ah, on how they were treated when they very young. (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yes, yes. 

01:33:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, ah, missed opportunity that, ah, they now define as (inaudible ) race but maybe it's something that's, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:33:42
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. 

01:33:42
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...it's, it's deeper in that sense. 

01:33:45
BAILEY W. JACKSON Yeah. Great. 

01:33:45
