Issues in Counseling African American Clients A Lecture by Thomas A. Parham, Ph.D. Counseling Psychologist 

00:00:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Hello. I'm Dr. Thomas Parham. Over the past several decades, there has been increasing attention in the literature on providing psychological services to populations that are culturally different. In fact, a quick examination of the literature will reveal a multitude of topics and several general themes, which culturally different scholars have used to echo their concerns about issues affecting multicultural populations in the therapeutic context. Among these topics, if we think about these for a minute, include questions about the appropriateness of cross-ethnic counselor, testing and assessment procedures with culturally different populations, counselor preference of minority students, the need for more systemic approaches in counseling practice, and even the underutilization of psychological services by culturally different people. Now, while these general themes were necessary to underscore the importance of addressing issues affecting culturally different people, by and large, I think the present state of affairs in counseling psychology suggest that there is general agreement that we need to be more culturally sensitive when working with people from various ethnic and racial backgrounds. Now, a limitation of the general themes that we discussed earlier is somehow that they have a tendency to over generalize. And so as such, many scholars, and psychologists, and counselors, and, and contributors to the literature, are now calling on much more culturally specific theoretical constructs, research strategies and treatment modalities. And so, the primary purpose of this videotape will be to discuss specific issues, and therapeutic models and techniques that are appropriate for use with African-American populations. And so I'd like to invite you to come explore with me, issues related to counseling African-American populations. Now, as we begin, let me outline for you what we'll try to cover in this videotape. First of all, if you are a counselor, psychologist, ah, psychiatrist, social worker or other allied mental health professional, and you have a serious desire to assist African-American clients in counseling, in therapy, then you will need, I think, at least five basic tools. The first is an understanding about why we even need a Black or an Afrocentric psychological perspective. Secondly, you'll need a knowledge of the history of African people in the professional psychology and counseling and how they've been portrayed in the literature. Thirdly, you'll need knowledge of an Afrocentrical oriented value system and how that impacts clients and clinicians as they work in therapeutic settings. Fourth, you'll need an Afrocentric therapeutic focus and the knowledge of such so that you can tailor your own clinical work to those specific issues. And fifth, you'll need a willingness to become a change agent or what we refer to as a "Social engineer." Now, as we begin our videotape, these four tools or five tools I should say, will, in fact, be the focus of what we'll do in tape number one. Let's begin by talking about an understanding of why we even need a Black psychological perspective. Now, psychology has been around for many thousands of years, even though as it's been popularized here in America, it is barely more than, say, a hundred years old. Psychology really dates back to the days of Ancient Kemet. Ancient Kemet is what we now know as Ancient Egypt. In fact, Wade Nobles reminds us in some of his writings that in its truest form, psychology, was defined by the ancient Africans as the "study of the soul or the spirit." Nobles further asserts that the psychology borrowed from Africa and popularized in Europe and America, the so-called "Western Psychology" or the "Eurocentric perspective" as you'll hear it referred to. In some respects, represents a, a distortion of ancient African-Egyptian thought because what the ancients believe was the study of the soul of the spirit, was somehow translated by Europeans in to the study of only one element of a person's psychic nature, that being the mind. And so somehow, we have come to understand that psychology, in its truest form, is really the study of human behavior. If you're going to work with African-American populations, we need to understand that psychology, really, is about the illumination of the spirit and the study of the soul, and we need to understand that, first and foremost. Now, if we think about Eurocentric psychology in our traditional counseling theories and, and techniques, what do we know? See, we know that in their attempt to understand the minds and, and behaviors of their people, European and many European-American scholars and, and writers, and theorists, began to develop theories of human behavior. And if we think for a moment what theories are, theories are nothing more than abstract concepts that we develop or that we use to make sense out of data that we see. And so, what happens essentially is that, theories of personality or, or psychology, or organized systems of belief that help us to understand human nature and to make sense out of scientific data or the behavior phenomenon. It's important to realize, however, that these theories are based on the philosophies and the customs, and the moral race(ph) and the values of specific cultural groups, in this case, Europeans. So this is certainly been true for the theories that have emerged out of Euro-American frame of reference. Now, in their attempt to explain what they considered to be u, ah, universal human phenomenon, Euro-American psychologists implicitly and explicitly, I think, began to establish a normative standard of behavior which all of the cultural groups are measured against. And so what emerged is as normal or abnormal, what emerged as sane or insane, what emerges as relevant or irrelevant, is always in relationship to a White European or Euro-American frame of reference. So for many White social scientists and psychologists, somehow, the word "different" became synonymous with deficient. So what do we know? If in fact, you set up a normative standard that is Eurocentrically based, is really there anything wrong with that normative standard? No. To the degree that that normative standard does apply to the population on which it was developed, that standard in fact is very consistent. However, when you try to take that normative standard that was developed by White psychologists to explain behavior of European or European-American people and try to apply it to people who are culturally different, oftentimes you'll get problems. The problem is, again, that difference-equals-deficiency logic. To the degree that you view anything that deviates from that normative standard as deficient rather than merely different, the conclusions that you draw and the, the, the ah, consequences of your particular practice are sometimes inappropriate for conceptualizing client dynamics. In fact, Joe White speaks to that issue very clearly in his seminal article, "Towards A Black Psychology." What he writes is that, it is very difficult if not impossible, to understand the lifestyles of African people, of Black people, using traditional psychological theories that were developed by White psychologists to explain White behavior. When this happens, what we get are very many weakness dominated, and inferiority oriented conclusions about African people. And so, the necessity for a Black psychological perspective really comes out of the need to create a different normative standard for what is in fact, healthy psychological functioning or what we in Black psychology refer to as "Optimal human functioning." What we refer to as "Order versus disorder behavior." If you're really interested in trying to understand what in fact is normal behavior from an Afrocentric perspective, you have to use something other than a European-American frame of reference. Now secondly, the tool that you'll need to really understand how that frame of reference has been applied, by frame of reference, we're talking here about the Eurocentric frame of reference in, in a very negative fashion, I think it's important to have knowledge of the history of African people in the profession of psychology and counseling. And so, first of all, let us continue to talk about that. Historically, I think research in general on, on African-Americans and probably most culturally different people, has shifted focus several times. But Alexander Thomas and Samuel Sillen in their book, "Racism and Psychiatry," and Stanley Sue in, in an unpublished paper that he wrote around 1975, talked about the idea that it's very difficult, if not impossible, to really understand the history of African people and culturally different people in counseling and psychology without reference to three general themes. And so, let's review these three general themes and see if we can't work with that. The first theme that we know about was called the "Inferiority Theme." Inferiority. And as we think about what the theme represents. 

00:10:35
[sil.] 

00:10:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM  The Inferiority Theme, where they talked about the fact that African people, Black people, were intellectually, physically, and mentally inferior to their White counterparts. Somehow, the theme was based out of the theory of genetics that said that somehow, Black people were born genetically inferior. Now, what's interesting about this particular theme are some of the ah, hypotheses that emerged out of it. These assertions of racial inferiority in fact, began much la, ah, earlier than the 1900's. In fact, we can go back as far as 1799 and look at Professor Charles White who describes the African-American, then called the Negro or Black people, as being just above the ape in the animal-human hierarchy with small brains, deformed features, an ape-like odor and an animal immunity to pain. As we move along in the literature, we can move to around 1839 and look at Professor Morton, who first did the studies in cranial capacity. And it was Professor Morton in fact, who concluded that based upon the African skull and the European skull's measurement, and European skull holding more peppercorn or pepper seeds than the African skull, he thereby concluded that somehow, one had more cranial capacity and cranial mass, and thereby justify the intellectual superiority of Europeans over African people. As we move up, in fact into more contemporary times, we can see this theme of genetic inferiority, represented in almost every decade of traditional psychology. If you start from 1900's and go all the way through 1970, you'll find very prominent Euro-American psychologists. Many of which have been president of the American Psychological Association, who have been proponents of that genetic inferiority theme. Now, the second theme that emerges as you understand just the history of African people and how they fared is what we call the "Cultural Deficiency Theme." 

00:12:50
[sil.] 

00:12:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Now, this Cultural Deficiency Theme here, was supposedly a more liberal approach to the conceptualization of African people and Black people. And what the Cultural Deficiency Theme suggested was that, yes in fact, they do have difficulties. They do have difficulties in cognitive abilities, emotional problems, physical, whatever it might be. But somehow, rather than conclude, as it did in the Inferiority Theme, that these deficits were related to genetics, what the Culture Deficiency Theme assumes is that these deficiencies are somehow related to lack of exposure to a proper environmental stimulus. And so, what begins to emerge around the 50's, ah, middle 50's and late 60's, is the so-called cultural deprivation theme. Now, what's interesting to note about this, is that this model, as it rose in our position to the Inferiority Theme, began to take on somehow, a lot of legitimacy but you begin to see one of the fallacies that is inherently in it and that somehow, if you assume that people are culturally deprived, whose culture were they supposedly deprived of? In this case, we go back to that European-American cultural, ah, norm as a standard, again viewing different sized deficiency rather than different. An example of the research that emerges out of the Cultural Deficiency Theme, in fact, we can even look at ah, the, the classic work in psychiatry by Abraham Kardiner and, and, ah, Ovesey, on 1951, entitled "The Mark of Oppression" there, these authors concluded that the Negro had no basis for a healthy self-esteem and every incentive for self-hatred. They assume that oppression was such a formidable opponent in the lives of Black people. That somehow it was inescapable for them to ah, ah, be somehow, just totally devastated by oppression and discrimination that, that would impact their lives. You can look at the work, in fact, by Moynihan on the Black family. It's interesting to note that Moynihan set out with a team of researchers connected with the Federal government to study Black family dynamics, and what they somehow concluded, ah, in the report that was published, I think, in 1965 entitled "The Negro Family: A Case for National Action," is that the Black family lacks the necessary tools to stimulate and/or develop intellectual growth and creativity. What they do was they took a survey into different geographical regions, I think primarily in the Northeast co, ah, corridor of the United States. Began to then survey African-American families and again compared them to what was essentially a Eurocentric, European-American family structured norm. And somehow concluded, that not only was it different but somehow, that it was pathological. And in fact, Moynihan concludes in some of his research that the Black family is a tangle and a web of pathology. Now again, these are examples of the deficit deficiency model that has emerged from that. It's interesting to see, for example, as a side on how much psychology has really impacted our lives because if you look at a number of the social programs that emerged out of the 50's and 60's, they emerged out of this cultural deficiency notion. If you look at Headstart(ph), if you look at the ESCA program, if you look at Upper Bound, and even the EOP, all of these emerged out of the notion that somehow, African people or Black people are somehow culturally deprived and somehow need to be culturally enriched or culturally stimulated. And so, these hypotheses and themes emerged. Now, the third really movement within psychology is, or theme is what we call "Multicultural." 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:16:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM  And this Multicultural Theme really suggest that all cultural groups have strengths and limitations. And that if you want to understand a specific cultural group, somehow you cannot use a normative standard developed on another culture, in this case, European-Americans, to in fact appreciate that specific culture. And as I mentioned at the beginning of this tape, what we are now moving to is away from culturally generic models and more to cultural specificity in terms of what it is that we need to know about African-Americans. Now, as we shift focus in talking about ah, first of all, why we need a Black psychological perspective and having some sense of knowledge of history of African people and how they fared in the psychological literature via these three themes, I think it's now important to turn our attention to what is an Afrocentrically oriented value system. We hear a lot of people talk about Afrocentricity and, and Afrocentrically oriented systems without having really a, a, a reasonable understanding about what all that is, is, is uhm, ah, really about. And so what we'd like to do now is turn our attention to talk about that. First of all, let's define what in fact, is Afrocentricity because we hear a lot of word about that. Afrocentricity is a term coined among other people, by Molefi Asante. Ah, in fact, I'll refer you to his book, "The Afrocentric Idea" ah, which provides, a, a very good conceptual analysis of that. Afrocentricity basically is, placing African ideals, placing African ideals at the center of any analysis that involves African culture and behavior. Placing African ideals at the center of any analysis that involves African culture and behavior. Now, Afrocentric refers really to a world view that is centered in Africa as a historical point of generation. Within that context then, Psychology and Counseling by its nature, becomes the study of human illumination, a principle of life as one reasons with the unity that contains and transcends all opposites. What does that mean? What it means essentially, is that, in our analysis of culturally different folks, what we know is that the bodies of research that have emerged, have been primarily, European and, Black American. But the question that a lot of scholars are really beginning to ask themselves is, if you examine most of our research and what we know about African people, you'll find out that somehow our samples that have been taken to develop the geocentric norm are very small subset of this whole of Black America. And the interesting thing about these particular samples, is that these samples have been primarily based on what I would call Southern-born, working class, low SES, inner city residing or ghetto-dwelling Black people. And so somehow, if you develop a cultural norm that is based upon this particular subset, it means that you develop a psychology, theories, modes of behavior, normative standards on a population that, in fact, is not generalizable to the whole of Black America. And so what a lot of scholars are now calling for is that if in fact you really want to find out what is truly African or Afrocentric, what you have to do is go back to in fact, an African centered frame of reference. And so the idea of Afrocentricity is our attempt to go back to African value systems, African cultural dispositions, to somehow frame what it is that is normal, optimal human functioning, ordered behavior among African people. And so, an Afrocentric approach then, thus, focuses on placing African-American cultural norms at the center or core of any theoretical analysis of Black behavior or psychological functioning. An Afrocentric approach therefore, tempts to describe the Black personality as it might occur on the normal, natural conditions in an undistorted or uncontaminated form that is somehow distorted or contaminated by our perception here, that somehow doesn't represent in fact what is truly African. Now, as we think about a value system in our, our counseling and, and in psychology practice, what kind of value system is likely to emerge as clients come into our own counseling practice? 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Now, as we talk about the different dimensions, let me just review these really quickly. The first dimension is the self, and what we'll do is contrast these dimensions here across, a Eurocentric, and an Afrocentric, 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:22:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM  frame of reference. The self, first of all, in the Eurocentric tradition, the self is very fragmented, or dichotomized. It doesn't matter whether you refer to the three structures of personality by Freud, the Id, Ego, Superego. It doesn't matter whether you refer to the three ego states in transactional analysis, the parent, adult, and child. It doesn't matter whether you refer to three dimensions of human behavior, the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. Somehow, the self is as always seen to be fragmented or artificially bifurcated into individual component parts. In the Afrocentric tradition, the self is much more holistic. Now, the holistic sense, remember that the self that we become is somehow the study of one's spirit. It's somehow spiritness made evident. It isn't just the cognitive dimension, or the affective dimension, or the behavioral dimension, it is how all of those come together in a manifestations of one spiritual essence, the self in an African tradition. The second dimension that we contrast, are feelings. Feelings, in the Eurocentric tradition, unfortunately are seen as needing to be suppressed. Somehow, the suppression of feelings and somehow being able to control your feelings was always really important. It's interesting to me that even in, in 1992, there's still somehow, a value, a latent judgment, placed on one's ability to control their feelings versus not. Now, it doesn't make the control of feelings or the expression of feelings either good or bad, or right or wrong. The only difference is, if in fact, you create a normative standard, can you really contrast differences here? As we look at for example, some stereotypes about why emotional people do not make good decision makers. Ain't that interesting? Somehow emotional people do not make good decision makers, it's in fact in deference to the fact that somehow, if in fact, you're emotional sometimes, you are less in control of yourself, that somehow you need to defer emotional response and emotional ah, expression to more rationally oriented priorities. In an Afrocentric tradition, feelings are seen as something that are very legitimate and in fact, should be expressed rather than suppressed. Now, what's interesting is, to a degree that you see a client in a therapeutic context, who comes in, who is very emotionally expressive, does that in fact mean, that the person has very low impulse control, it does it mean that a person is somehow ah, ah, hysterical, does it mean the person is somehow histrionic, maybe not. Maybe you have what is known as just a very culturally expressive client, who may in fact be expressing a different cultural standard and a different tradition, manifesting a different sense of himself than what you will find in a Eurocentric tradition. The third mode or dimension that we look at, that we'll explore today, is survival. Now, what's interesting is that in the Eurocentric tradition, survival is somehow individual. Survival was somehow competitive. It goes back almost to the Darwinian ethic that said only the strong survives. Somehow, there's an individual, competitive notion to the concept of survival. In an Afrocentric tradition, survival is much more collective, which by the way is related to the concept of the self. There's an old African proverb that says: "I am because we are, and because we are, therefore, I am." It meant essentially that, an individual was only important to the degree that he or she contributed to the maintenance and survival of the group or the tribe. So we understand as African people that we owe our very existence to somehow, your parents, to your grandparents, to previous generations and somehow have a responsibility to those generations that are yet unborn. There's a collective survival instinct there. Does it make it better or worse? It clearly is an Afrocentric cultural norm, but just different than that of the European norm. Now, what's interesting about that is, oftentimes when you find Black clients, African-American people in school settings, in, in hospitals, in, in college or universities, in mental health centers, wherever, using collective survival strategies, using group approaches to get, get pass. Oftentimes, people mistake this, because they compare to this particular cultural norm and somehow conclude that these people are practicing inappropriate dependence. Isn't it appropriate dependence or just a cultural style? I would argue the latter rather than the former. In another form, we find (coughs) that language, 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM  and communication is expressed very differently across the cultures. Language in the Eurocentric tradition is somehow written, and it's also very formal and detached. Now, the formal and detached aspect of this is particularly important for our counseling practice. Somehow, if in fact you communicate with somebody and you do not communicate in writing, there's almost a belief that it didn't exist. When we think about having contracts. If you and I make a contract and it's verbal, and we somehow have to go to arbitration or to court, the first thing they'll you is, "Well, do you have any proof that you made an agreement with this particular individual?" Somehow, if it's not written down, if it's not documented, and if historical records are somehow not written somewhere, they are almost seen to be less valid or even non-existent. In an Afrocentric tradition, language rather than being very written, relies more on the oral tradition, rather than being very formal, it's very informal, and rather than being attached or detached rather, there is almost an interconnectedness 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:29:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM  between the speaker and the listener. Now, the interconnectedness is really important because as you think about communicating with African-American populations, the idea that somehow you should have a relationship with that individual, is really important. That somehow, you cannot be separate and apart from what you speak. Ah, one of the best examples in fact, that we used to illustrate this particular dimension of, of, ah, of, our, our contrasting, ah, value systems, is in fact, the church. If you go in fact two of, ah, a, a typical White Anglo-Saxon protestant church, you'll find in fact the minister, somebody who's giving ah, ah, the sermon ah, reading the word out, basically reading without much participation and interaction with the audience. In fact, if you go into the Black church, you will find in fact, very much of ah, attachment between the speaker and the listener, and they do that to the call-response format. So you'll see people ah, in, in various stages of, of, of the, the, the, the monologue or the dialogue, express things like, Amen, and say it sir, and yes sir, and tell me some more, and teach me, and you know, those kind of call-responses that really are not just cultural styles but really used to illustrate the interconnectedness between the speaker and the listener. Now, this maybe really important for you as you're thinking about engaging in a counseling function with a client, and trying to be very formal and detached and sit back as opposed to being very connected through your own language style with that particular client. Now, another dimension that I want to ah, ah, deal with today is the concept of the universe. And the concept of the universe for Europeans is one of control. Throughout history, we can see that Europeans have almost ah, a, a pathological obsession with controlling. First, ah, ah, if you go back to the explorers, it wasn't about really exploration, it was about conquest and control of different lands and different areas of the globe. If you now look at our own ah, ah, race for space, the race for space is not about just exploration, it's about control of the moon and the stars. Ah, it's analogous to the same ah, ah, Manifest Destiny Concept that you found ah, ah, early settlers in, in, ah European-Americans engaging in. Somehow, controlling the universe is almost antithetical to an Afrocentric frame of reference because our notion is to somehow live in harmony with the universe. There's a principle in the African tradition that is called "consubstantiation." It means literally, elements of the universe are of one substance. Elements of the universe are of one substance, which means that there is a connection, a connectedness to all things that are living. And so, if in fact, your goal is to live in harmony with the universe and really appreciate that ontological principle of consubstantiation, the question is, how is it, that our counseling practices are engaged in trying to help a person live in harmony with their specific environment and the forces that control that as opposed to somehow, trying to control their particular environment. And the last dimension that I wanna contrast today that really talks about an Afrocentric value system has to do with the concept of worth. Now, worth in the Eurocentric tradition, is defined by material possession. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Stop and think for a minute, if you're out on the street, you see some people walking by and you just stop and take a look for a minute, how would you immediately recognize that that's an important individual? When I asked my students this, the answers are, are, are really apparent. Maybe by the car they drive, maybe by the clothes they wear, maybe by the house that they live in. It's somehow, material possession is equated with a sense worth. In the African tradition, one's sense of worth has to do with contribution and that contribution is to one's community. There was always a collective sense of self. If somehow, I arrive at a place in line where I am a Ph.D. psychology and somehow do not use that degree to benefit my people to make a contribution to that community, somehow, you know, ah, ah, that is, is really a cultural violation. Somehow, my sense of worth has to be defined by more than, do I drive a fancy car, do I live in a fancy house, do they call me doctor and my title, and those kinds of things. And so, what we can appreciate here is we think about Afrocentricity, remember that Afrocentric approach focuses on placing African-American cultural norms at the center or core of any theoretical analysis that we engage in the Brown, African people. And so, what I invite you to consider, is that on these particular dimensions, the idea is that rather than use a fragment as sense of self. Think about considering Black clients in terms of a holistic sense of self, rather than viewing their feelings as being somehow needing to be suppressed, view them as, as naturally being expressed. African people are very emotionally expressive people, you're likely to see that manifest itself on a therapeutic context. In terms of their survival, survival is always collective. The group is always more important than the individual. How does that manifest itself in the client's life? And in fact, to what degree are client issues and problems, and concerns that they bring with them to the therapeutic focus related to the fact that they are trying to be more individually oriented and competitive oriented rather than collective. In terms of their language, the old tradition, very informal but also that interconnectedness. There's a rule there for conduct between the therapist and the client that says that somehow you need to be connected with that particular client in terms of your language usage. In terms of, of our relationship to the universe, the theme is really one of harmony. How can you help that client really live in harmony with the universe and really restore that sense of balance that is really necessary. And in terms of their sense of worth, worth in the African tradition is measured by contribution to one's community rather than somehow, ah, the acquisition of material possession and reward. Now, now that we have focused on that particular dimension, we've got essentially two left. We talked earlier about needing to have knowledge of an Afrocentric therapeutic focus and what does that really mean? What really goes on when you have a, an African client in therapy with you? What are the issues that that client is likely to bring with him and what kinds of things do you need to pay attention to as a therapist? Well, let's discuss that now. What do we know, first of all? First of all, we know for most of our literature that there is really a shift from hospitalization and institutionalization to more out-patient and community mental health center facilities. And somehow, despite that shift, we see that African-American clients are still under-represented and under served. In fact, if you look at most of the literature, and African-American clients are no different than other cultural groups, we will find that most of us, most clients, who need psychological services probably do not get them. And of those who do come into counseling, our statistics show that more than 50 percent of them terminate therapy after the initial session. That means, after one session, these clients do not come back. What is it that's going on in the counseling process that does not allow African-American clients to feel comfortable with coming back? I think there are a number of explanations for that. Uhm, but one of the things that almost always emerges if you consult the literature, is somehow they're receiving treatment by somebody who is not of their own cultural background. And so therapeutic match really is one of those factors that we need to discuss, ah, and is really important I think, to be able to make a connection to that client. But assuming that you don't have even that cultural match on, on the ethnic ah, issue or the gender issue, what is it that we need to be concerned about when counseling African-Americans? What's involved when a client comes in to see you as a counselor, as a therapist, in a counseling situation? First of all, you have a client who has an extreme willingness to take a risk on you, as a representative of the mental health system, in spite of the fact that African-American people have had a very negative history in terms of psychological service delivered. We have a history as you consult the literature of having a high propensity of being misdiagnosed or we present with the same symptoms as our Euro-American counterparts. We have a history where you have clients who are ah, received drugs in institutionalization versus therapy as a treatment of choice. They have a greater likelihood of being seen by peer counselors as opposed to professional staff, and by ah, having a perception that somehow the service delivered that that they received is somehow less than adequate. So that extreme willingness to take a risk on the counseling, ah, profession and you as a counselor is really important and so you wanna be able to explore that. Secondly, there's a extreme possibility that the traditional support systems that African-American clients typically rely on is maybe not functional. What do I mean? I mean that before most African-American folks would think about coming to a psychologist. The reservoirs of wisdom in our community are not necessarily those who have degrees. Psychology as a matter of fact is not a very respected profession in the Black community. The reservoirs of wisdom are those who have age. So for example, you might consult your grandmother, you might consult a preacher, you might consult that old fourth grade teacher, who you were, ah, had a very good relationship with, and now that you're 21, are still involved in, in, in working with. Now, for some reason access in those support networks may not be appropriate. It could be because of geographical reason, you could be at a college or a university campus that is 200 miles away from home. So the support system isn't there, or you could have an issue or a concern that, that, that the client believes is so ah, embarrassing or, or they're just unwilling to talk about it with the traditional support network that they choose not to access it by their own volition(ph). But for whatever reason, if you're likely to see them in a counseling situation, you can probably believe that the traditional support system is non-functional. Now, with that is also likely to represent is the fact, that the client is likely to come to you more moderately to severely debilitated than he or she might have been had they come to you initially when the problem first presented itself. Thirdly, there is a sense of fear and suspiciousness that is usually stimulated by the prospect of therapy itself. For African-American clients, I think that fear and suspiciousness is enhanced because of the possibility of working with the non African-American therapist or service provider. Now, am I suggesting that only African-Americans can work with African-American clients? No, what I am suggesting is that, given that transfers and dynamic that often exist in therapy, the likelihood that you, as a non-African-American person represents something significant in that person's life that maybe negative, is highly probable. We've got to be able to work to that. I think it's also appropriate to expect that that person is likely to be partially to well-educated and I say that because in my experience clinically, people who, ah, involve themselves in counseling and who are even sophisticated enough to think about exploring therapy as an option, are typically the more highly educated folks, because that's where they get exposure to counseling and therapy services. Generally, folks who are in the communities, ah, typically do not rely again on therapy as a, as a first to resource, also you're likely to see that people who come to you refer out of the community at least from two primary resources. The first resource is the schools, where often times, you as a counselor will get referrals or the second is the court system or the criminal justice system where you likely to get referrals from the court for parter, person who is somehow been a, a, a involved with, uhm, the court system. And so, that I think is, is really important to pay attention to. Now, once you get into the therapy session itself, you're actually sitting in there with the client, what kinds of things do you need to work with? First of all, you need to confront what are likely to be differential expectations. What do I mean? We as counselors almost expect our clients to come in and as Rogers said, "We expect the client to be the best expert on the client." So, we expect to sit back in using our natural, ah, ah, micro counseling skills or, or you know, generic counseling skills. We expect to kind of paraphrase and reflect and for the client to do most of the talking. Clients oftentimes come in with an expectation that since we are Doctor X or Doctor Y, that somehow, a doctor's job is to heal you and so the person who does the talking is the therapist. And so, if the therapist is now expecting the client to talk and the client is now expecting the therapist to talk and neither is talking, which, in fact, you have is kind of an impasse and rather than do what a lot of clinicians and therapist do by just label the client as this client is resistant, this client is non self-disclosive. Understand that what you may have is a question of differential expectation, rather than a resistant client. And so, we've got to begin to examine that as well. Now, one of the things by the way that I think can cut down on the lot of that differential expectation is something that we call pre-therapy education. It's, it's, it's analogous to bringing the client in, say 15 minutes before the schedule of appointment and exposing them either to some visual materials, ah, via paper or pamphlet, to an audio tape that they might be able to listen to or to video tapes that they might be able to watch that basically explains to them about your facility, about what the counseling process is about and about what they're likely to experience as they go and interact with you in, in a counseling situation. Okay, secondly, you're likely to see an initial lack of self-disclosure on the part of this African-American client anyway, because of just the lack of trust. Trust is, is very difficult to break down, for most clients but for African-American clients, particularly if you are in there with a service provider who is non African-American that's likely to be difficult as well. Again, we talked about the lack of sophistication about what therapy is, you know, there's a way, I think to get that through, through ah, pre-therapy education. Another one of the clinical symptoms that I see oftentimes, ah, displayed in African-American clients is that the chief complaint will be disguised. So that they may not, will, ah, want you to see what's really wrong with them, they may in fact try to test you, to see whether or not you can be a resource person for them. Ah, quick example, I had a client once who came in, who on intake was visibly upset ah, and, and kind of teary-eyed and really trying to hold it back, but came in with an idea of wanting to, ah, you know, need some help around the financial concern or problem that they were having. And all of my counseling skill and all of my probing and all of my whatever, wouldn't get at what was really going on with a particular client. You know, he was very, very insistent that what he needed in the moment was some assistance on financial help. Now, if I define my role as a psychologist, as a counselor in terms of meeting the needs of the client. My question then was how could I then assist this person in getting some help with that financial concern. I wanted to be a resource person for him. Now, in some let, respects that was very different than what other counselors may do. When somehow they's, they define their role, in terms of function, which I'm a psychologist, young man, I'm not a social worker or I'm not a financial aid counselor. You need the financial aid office on the other side of campus, so please go there and just leave that alone. Now, in my saying that the person might not of need of financial aid counseling. No. What I'm saying is that there was a way to be a resource person for them, rather than just refer them out to a system that's likely to be frustrating for them, in the first place. To make the long story short with this young man what I did, is I shared with him my sense, my intuition, that something was troubling him, ah, and in, in my counseling kind of emphatic way suggested that I'd be more than willing to help, but clearly what he was articulating to me in the moment was his need for some financial help. And so, what I did was I got on the phone, called up the financial aid office and really tried to help that individual get an appointment with somebody. I got him an appointment right then on the spot, with the counselor, referred him there and where they share with him that this was a way that in fact that he could kind of bypass the lines, the red tape and all those things that would prove frustrating for him, get right to the person and get his, ah, problem resolved. Once he left the situation, what he did say or what I did say to him rather was, "It's very clear to me that you got something that's troubling you and I really would like to help you work through some of that and so let me invite you to come back and think about, you know, seeing me when you get this other issue resolved." Well, three weeks later, client calls, would like another appointment, we come into see and we ended up establishing a therapeutic relationship where I worked with this client for about three to four months in therapy and the issue that the client was dealing with is that he came from what was essentially a single parent home and his mother who was his primary caregiver as he had just come to college, have been killed in an auto accident and this was an individual who had no time really to think about grieving because he was so busy trying to worry about how am I gonna function, you know, and get the financial resources that I need to continue school or whatever it is that I wanna do. Well, it was my ability I think, to assist him in being a resource person for him that allowed me to get to that secondary issue which was really, what was the most important for him. And so, I give you that to say that oftentimes, you'll find with African-American clients as with other clients that the chief complaint maybe disguised. And so, what you wanna do is to make sure that you define your role in terms of, ah, helping the client to meet whatever need that might be rather than just limiting your role to specific functions and somehow proving frustrating to the client. Now, with African-American clients you'll also see some denial of extent to which the presenting problem is a problem. For example, I could be a client who comes in to see you and says, "Well, I just kinda broke out with, uhm, ah, my spouse and my girlfriend, ah, but hmm, no big thing." There is somehow, ah, you know, a denial there about the hurt, the anger, the, the, whatever that might be going on with that particular client related to that issue. What's important to remember about that is that, there's a cultural style that develops in African-American people that is almost like I have to laugh to keep from crying, because we have been the victims of so much oppression and discrimination in life, if in fact, we stop to shut down for every little thing that went wrong in our life, we'd be just depressed 24 hours a day. And so what a lot of Black Americans learned particularly, African-American males is somehow, I have to be able to take a blow, to take a setback, to take a tragedy and be able to keep on, keepin' on in spite of that. And so when you see them in counseling or therapy and you see some denial of the extent to which that problem is a problem, ah, it's always a good idea I think to just double check or keep that in the back of your mind that, that maybe an issue that you need to further explore with them, later on in the therapy process. I think you're also likely to see clinical symptoms that manifest themselves in a different way. Ah, somehow, uhm, it's, it's likely that you may find a client who might be a little bit more suspicious. Does that mean the client is paranoid? I'm not sure, it's likely that you're, you're likely to see stress reactions manifest themselves in terms of somatic complaints. We see this a lot with African-American clients. Ah, the classic signs of depression that you might find, uhm, lack of energy, loss of interest in usual activities, ah, ah, loss of appetite, uhm, you know, very lethargic, ah, you know, crying a lot, those kind of things. Sometimes you will see, but oftentimes you'll find depression manifest in terms of anger. Oftentimes related to that thing of of, kind of laugh and keep from crying, I got to keep on, keeping on despite ah, whatever tragedy, hardship that I've been through. You'll see in fact, African-American folks speed up as opposed to slow down. And so, this is something that you want, ah, ah, be careful to recognize in African-American clients as well. You're also as in most counseling interactions likely to see race being a central theme, in related to a lot of things that they do and so eh, eh, as we think about bringing this particular session to a close. We wanna remind you that in terms of, of this fourth area(ph) of knowledge, these are some of the things that you'll need in terms of, of a knowledge base in working with African-American clients and some of the things are likely to manifest itself. Now, I said that at the beginning of the tape that our fifth kind of tool that we would need in wanting to work with African-American clients had to do with the necessity to become a social engineer or change agent. What do we mean? Most of us do train in traditional counseling theories, theories of personality, it doesn't matter whether it's Freudian ah, ah, client-centered and, and, and, ah, Rogers, Cognitive Behavioral and, and LS. Ah, whatever the, ah, ah, Perls and Gestalt, whatever the therapeutic or theoretical focus maybe. It's important to understand that oftentimes these theories assume that the etiology of the problem is intrapsychic, meaning that is somehow in the individual and so if the etiology is intrapsychic, then the target of your intervention as a therapist necessarily has to be intrapsychic. What I would like to remind you, as we close this tape is that oftentimes problems that emerged from African-American clients in other culture and different people are not necessarily intrapsychic but oftentimes psychosocial and so if in fact you take a client who has a problem with the environment or psychosocial phenomenon and you counsel them to be basically well, what you potentially create is a mentally healthy person who is still vulnerable to social pathology and so what myself and Joe White have written in our latest book, ah, entitled, "The Psychology of Blacks: An African-American Perspective," is that the key to kind of phase three of, of African-American psychology or Black psychology if you will, will be the ability to apply psychology and become social engineers. That means that we have to be able to use client concerns as a barometer for social change. When a client comes in and talks about the fact that there have, ah, being frustrated by X or Y by the fact that they've been confronted with racism and discrimination, by the fact that different things are going on in their life. We have to be able to translate those client concerns and use them as evidence for structural defects, in the fabric and the foundation of society and other kinds of, of social phenomenon that are going on. And so, somehow being able to use our clinical expertise and our knowledge of that client base to somehow reform and change society is really what's going to be important in terms of being an advocate for that particular client. And so again, what we leave you with is the idea that becoming a social engineer is also part of the role in being able to work with African-American clients. Now, in summation, what we like to leave you with is the idea that an Afis, African-American psychological perspective is really necessary if you're gonna deal with Black clients. The idea that somehow you can use a Eurocentric normative standard to treat all African-American clients is somehow less than appropriate. We've seen in titled literature and to our demonstrations earlier in the tape that, when this occurs, as Joe White talked about, meaning weakness dominated and inferiority-oriented conclusions emerge. If we're gonna be effective at working with African-American clients, we have to have some knowledge about their own history, about their own cultural value system, about their own family systems, about the way in which they conduct their lives and have cultural, normative standards that allowed them to kinda ah, live life in a way that is most ordered for them. You will also need in terms of tools again, knowledge of history of African people, in terms of the professional psychology and counseling, knowledge of an Afrocentrically oriented value system and what in fact is Afrocentricity. The idea that knowledge of an Afrocentric therapeutic focus on which you would likely to find with Black client in therapy and finally, the willingness to expand your skills as a psychologist, to be a social engineer. If you could do all that, I think you will be a long way towards becoming a very effective therapeutic, ah, ah, agent with clients who are culturally different. I'd like to thank you for being a part and ah, ah, of, of this session with me and we look forward to talking to you again on another tape. Thank you.
