ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Evidence based mental disorder diagnosis is one of the most crucial things that clinicians can learn in a counseling process. And the reason is, because it is the foundation of everything that comes after that working with clients. It’s also one of the most misunderstood parts of the counseling process. For example, did you know that 46 percent of Americans will develop a mental disorder at some point in their lifetime. That’s almost one out of every two people. Perhaps you, perhaps a family member. Certainly someone that you know, whether it’s a colleague or a friend. You have to ask yourself, why does America have a 46 percent lifetime prevalence rate of mental disorders and many of these disorders are increasing in prevalence every single year. It could be that more people are suffering from symptoms of mental disorders. But it also is very likely that over diagnosis and misdiagnosis are a key part of why prevalence rates are skyrocketing in America. That’s one of the many reasons why evidence based mental disorder diagnosis is crucial for all of you in order to be successful as clinicians and in order to help you clients recover. Diagnosis, is something that we need to communicate with other mental health professionals. Continuity of care. When someone receives services from you and then another clinician in the future. It’s also something that can help you increase your own professional reputation. The better you can diagnosis, the more accurately the more likely you’ll be respected by colleagues and peers, the more likely you’ll be able to get promoted in your profession. Also, evidence based mental disorder diagnosis helps reduce your own liability. Did you know, that there are actually ethical codes linked to assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders. For example, the American Counseling Associations ethical codes, section E, specifically talks about how to assess and diagnosis mental disorders accurately without bias. These are just some of the many reasons why you must learn how to, not only diagnosis, but to do it in an evidence based way. So it’s objective. And so it’s accurate. In order to know how to do that, first, let’s understand how diagnosis fits into the counseling process. So it’s a fluid system. We call this process the gold thread. One reason is, because if you learn this process you’ll be golden. The other reason is, because it creates a common thread or pathway throughout each stage of the counseling process. One flowing to the next. So it’s fluid, it makes sense to you and the client. And it will be evidence based. The first step in this golden thread is the assessment process. For the assessment process you must understand the client fully and accurately. If you can do that, then you could gather the important information that will lead you to identify what the current presenting concerns are. We call that a diagnosis. It’s really labeling what the client’s concerns are in a way that can be communicated to other professionals, third party payers, for billing purposes, and in a way that will help lead to a third counseling process, a treatment plan. A diagnosis should directly lead to what you and a client work on to reach your treatment goals. And then the treatment plan leads to that fourth stage, the treatment interventions. In order to follow this golden thread and make a smooth counseling process, it hinges on the assessment and diagnosis part of counseling. So, when you think of assessment, the first thing you must do is build repot with clients. This is essential because even though you may gather information from third parties, prior mental health professionals, friends or significant others of the client, the vast majority of information you’ll gain is from the client themselves. And so, if you listen to a client, openly and non-judgmentally and most importantly if you involve them in the assessment process, you’re must more likely to get accurate and objective information. And that’s critical. Because if you don’t, you’re at risk of misdiagnosis the client. That again, can lead to liability issues, it could lead to stigma for the client, many other problems. So, as your assessing the client, you’re working with them, you’re trying to find a common language for their presenting concerns, the goal is to really understand their suffering. In words that make sense to them and words that you and they can relate to. And then, thinking to yourself how might this relation to a possible mental disorder. If you think that a client might be suffering to an extent that they have a mental disorder, the first test of evidence based diagnosis, and this is crucial, is to know if the client’s symptoms meet the definition of a mental disorder. Believe it or not, even though we have a diagnostic and statistically manual of mental disorder, fifth edition, most clinicians fail to think about whether a client actually meets the definition of a mental disorder before they make that diagnosis. In order to meet that definition, you have to identify what’s called a syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of signs or observable aspects of the client suffering. Jitteriness, if their anxiety – if they’re anxious. Or looking down, eyes cast to the floor, crying. If they’re depressed. Things that are observed by you or others. And symptoms. Internal states or experiences that the client reports that relate to their distress. In the case of anxiety, reporting feeling nervous, feeling on edge inside. In the case of depression, explaining that there’s a feeling of feeling dejected that – that they’re demoralized. The collection of signs and symptoms have to cluster in a way that will tell you this is clinically significant for the person. Here’s why, everyone has what we might call symptoms of distress. We all feel anxious at some time, don’t we. We all feel down. Believe it or not, even brief psychotic symptoms are common in the general population. But, how do these cluster together to form what’s called a syndrome. Collection of signs and symptoms that lead to significant distress. This must be understood with the client. To know if they even might suffer from what we call a mental disorder. If you think that there is a syndrome present. And it’s significant for the person. Then, discuss with them, during the assessment process is it leading to significant distress. Or, is it impairing their live in some way. The most important aspect of understanding whether a syndrome might be classified as a mental disorder is to know if it causes major problems in living. This is the key. So, first, is a syndrome present, does it cause major problems in living. And can you identify what that is in a way that clusters together and makes sense as a disorder. Let me give you one example. If you have a cold. Let’s even say a flu. What might the symptoms be. You might have red eyes. You might have a stuffy nose. Aches and pains in the body. Lots of things that tell you these are flu like symptoms. We call it a flu because it’s a cluster of signs and symptoms. It’s a syndrome that we can name. We can identify and that could lead to a treatment plan and treatment ultimately for recovery. In a similar way, some people might be a little anxious about something, they might be afraid. They might be a little bit down or depressed. They might have minor cognitive issues, memory, etcetera, focus, attention. But these random things that we all experience in life often don’t come together in a very identifiable way. In a serious way that causes problems in living that we can name. And that would be a focus on mental health treatment. So first, is a mental disorder present. If it is, what is the pattern. That’s the next step in evidence based diagnosis. Is there a logical structured pattern, over time, over settings that tell you this is a major problem in living for the person. And it has to be for the person, not from your own perspective. If that’s the case, can you identify what it is. Well, the first step in doing that is narrowing it down to a category of mental disorders. DSM has many different categories. Some are anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bi-polar disorders, psychotic disorders. Just to name a few. Normally if you can narrow down a syndrome into a category you’re well on your way to evidence based diagnosis. The next step after narrowing it down to a category is seeing if you could identify a specific disorder within that category. You may or may not be able to do that. The good news is that diagnosis always provides an option. If you can’t find a specific name that identifies a syndrome within a category, there’s always in the international classification of diseases ninth version, a not otherwise specified diagnosis. This is broader and basically means it relates to the category, but I can’t yet exactly figure out what it is at this time. In the international classification of diseases tenth version, it’s called unspecified. Same thing. I’ve identified a category, it meets the definition of a mental disorder, it’s significant problems in living for the person, but I can’t exactly be more specific at this point in time. But if you can be more specific, definitely do it because that’s how you communicate with other people. Mental health professionals, courts, the client themselves. So you would ultimately want to name a specific disorder, if you can, and that point you write down the name and the code. If you follow this process, evidence based diagnosis can be your best friend. Again, talk to the client. Make them part of that assessment process. Ultimately, a client can look at their file any single time. They could understand but also know what your diagnosis is. So the more they’re a part of that process the more they’ll buy into it. And the more accurate the information you’ll gain. Understand together with them, if they have a mental disorder. By seeing if they meet that definition. And then, try to narrow it down to a specific category. That will give you a focus and it will help guide the remaining assessment process. The remaining assessment process is towards seeing if you could identify a specific name that can be labeled. Once you do so, log the name. Log the international classification of disease’s code. And then, finally, but most importantly, document your entire process. You know, we have a saying in the field if it isn’t documented it didn’t happen. Vital to protect yourself, to help the continuity of care for you client and for many other reasons, you must document how the client uh – uh, met the criteria for a mental disorder by describing that syndrome, describing the distress or the disability that it caused, you must then document very specifically, how they met the criteria for a mental disorder as defined in the DSM. And last but not least, I encourage everyone after that to step back and check yourself. The way to do that is to think to yourself, is this mental disorder, is this specific diagnosis maladaptive for the person in their culture. The reason I say to step back and check yourself after this whole process, is because unfortunately, a lot of research has shown that diagnosis really is simply in the eye of the beholder. You, the clinician, and there could be a lot of bias that comes into the process. The key to diagnosis and the key to making it evidence based, is to make sure that whatever the client is suffering it’s maladaptive for them in their own culture. Not a problem for you based on your own history. Because if you do that, you risk misdiagnosing over diagnosing potentially liability problems for yourself and potentially stigmatizing the client. In conclusion, evidence based diagnosis can be your best friend. But you must follow a process. You must document it along the way. You must include the client in this process. Because they can be your best friend, in evidence based diagnosis. And if you do that, you will be well on your way to helping your clients in recovery and well on your way to building your own professional reputation. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER  Dr. Schwartz thank you. I don’t know if I want evidence based diagnosing be my best friend. But it can be a close acquaintance. 

00:18:20
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ That’s true. 

00:18:20
SHANNON DERMER Um, do you think that most counselors struggle with diagnosis? And why? 

00:18:25
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:18:25
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ I do. I think most counselors not only in the beginning of their career as trainees, but even seasoned professionals struggle with diagnosis. Because it’s very complicated. It takes a lot of experience, years of practice. But regardless of how much experience anyone has, it’s still a very subjective process. We’re talking about life here. We’re talking about people’s problems. Biological, psychological, and social. That’s a very, very complex issue for someone to narrow in on and name. And so it really – as I said, does come down to what lens you’re wearing. It’s in the eye of the beholder. 

00:19:10
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:10
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, do you think people are quick to diagnosis so that we train them to automatically look for a diagnosis whether one really exists or not. 

00:19:20
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Absolutely. First of all, more and more people are quick to diagnosis because they’re trained that way. But also. Because in their professional life, there’s a lot of pressure to diagnosis quickly and often. And that has to do with reimbursement – reimbursement purposes and—and many other reasons. Uh, but the problem with that is that the quicker you do something the more likely you’re going to miss it. And so, a lot of – uh, the assessment process, a lot of really what comes down to the client’s suffering slips through the cracks. And people make surface level judgments. And end up labeling their clients rather than truly trying to understand their problems in living. So they could help them recover. 

00:20:10
SHANNON DERMER So you think there’s a little bit of a training bias and also a reimbursement bias that we have to diagnosis and diagnosis quickly, um, which actually in some ways diagnosing doesn’t fit with some of the corner stone of counseling which is really focusing in on wellness. And, um – and also some of the diagnosis, although they might not meet the DSM criteria doesn’t mean that they aren’t causing stress and problems. Yet we are – we are pushed to find DSM diagnosis. 

00:20:40
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yeah. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER So how do you see diagnosing with the cornerstone of counseling, which is wellness? How do they fit together? 

00:20:50
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:20:50
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Well, you make a good point. We are pushed to make a diagnosis and it does unfortunately, often become a self fulfilling prophecy. When you look for something hard enough you’re likely to find it. And that’s the case with mental disorders also. Um, especially when you include the pressure to – from supervisors or third party payers to diagnose an illness, it might take our mindset off of what we’re really trying to do. Which is help a client recover, as healthcare professionals. And so, I have seen for many, many years in many, many different ways, that this kind of pressure it – it really creates cognitive dissidence for many mental health professionals. Especially counseling professionals. 

00:21:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So how – we could talk a lot about the dangers of diagnosing. But your presentation here is on how to diagnose, how to diagnose well and how to make sure you’re actually diagnosing accurately. So what are the advantages then when you do all that, you diagnose well, and accurately of giving someone a diagnosis. 

00:22:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ There are advantages. If diagnosis is evidence based, if it’s more objective, if it’s more accurate, then it can actually exchange the counseling process. And that’s our goal. We want to be better counselors because we want to be of better service to our clients. And so, it does reduce our liability. It does help reduce stigma. And there is still widespread stigma of mental disorders in our society. But most importantly, it gives us a guide. Diagnosis can help us focus in on the treatment process. It could help us with a common language discussing personal, uh, concerns with clients. It helps us communicate with other professionals. As we know, clients often see many mental health professionals over the course of years, perhaps a lifetime. And keeping records of that, so we could all work together as a team, that’s the hallmark of health care. 

00:23:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:23:05
SHANNON DERMER Good. I’m glad you mentioned records. Because I want to talk about that for a minute. Progress notes, case notes, whatever you want to call them, and I liked your idea that – of the golden thread. Um, because I’ll often talk about that with my supervisees and students of how it’s not diagnosis or writing case notes or treatment plans, aren’t, um, separate things. They all should be connected and one should – conceptualizing and diagnosing should inform the treatment plan. The treatment plan should, you know, uh, inform, uh, the interventions you do. And so on. It should be seamless or have a golden thread. One of the things that I think, um, student, supervisees and actual counselors struggle with is how to document well, how you diagnosed and – and what that means. I mean, you mention a little bit in you presentation but when it comes to progress notes, what do they need to focus in on when they’re documenting? 

00:24:00
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:24:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Good question. And really important one. Usually, in the counseling process there’s something called a DA, diagnostic assessment. And that’s called different names, intake assessment or various other terms. And that’s usually the place where during the first session, possibly the second as well, people document the assessment process, the symptoms, that were determined and how that leads to a diagnosis. Usually that’s where it’s more fully defined in the record. It can also be in the progress notes as well. The first or second session progress notes. Regardless of where it is, the key is, that clinicians must document what the presenting concern is that lead the client in for treatment. That’s the first step. The second thing is, how significant are the presenting concerns. By that I mean, does it cause significant distress or does it cause a disability in the person’s life or both. If so, document what exactly the distress and or disability are. And is it at a level severity, is it pervasive enough to be considered an illness. It may not be. And what people often don’t realize nowadays, is that’s okay. A med – a diagnosis doesn’t have to include a mental disorder diagnosis. But if it does you should document why it is that significant or problematic in the person’s life. And then, look in the DSM, that specific criteria and document which criteria the person meets. If you do that, the presenting concern, the distress and disability, how it’s significant and problematic and then specific symptoms, you create a funneling technique that leads to a diagnosis which you code, likely bill for, and it becomes part of the client’s health care records. 

00:26:15
SHANNON DERMER Good. I – I find though that one of the things that people struggle with is, um, and how they write it up. Like I will talk to them about objective indicators. Of course you can mark down what the client reports. What other people report. You can mark down things, if you give assessment instruments. One of the things I find that students sometimes struggle with is when I say an objective indicator, they’ll say, oh well, they were anxious in session. And I’m like, but what does that look like. What do you see, what do you hear, specifically that leads you to some of those things. Are there any hints that you have for how to – how to do some of that, um, documenting besides just stating what other physicians may have reported or mental health clinicians or what the – the, um – the client actually says, well I feel this. How do you help them document what they might see or hear in session. 

00:27:05
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:27:05
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes, yes. Good point. Um, and as I mentioned, there’s two sides of the same coin related to symptoms or signs. And that – those are the two sides. Signs and symptoms. Uh, signs are things that are observable to other people. And these are also critical things to document. So if someone is – reports being sad, for example, it’s a very good idea to state that. And one way to do that, which is becoming increasingly popular is to actually quote the client. What did they say. I feel extremely distressed because of a loss. Quote that rather than paraphrasing and giving your interpretation. But then include documentation of what the signs are. The observable aspects of that. For example, client was crying in session. Client avoided eye-contact. Etcetera, Etcetera. Things that you can observe tend to make it a little bit more objective. But I do want to point out, both observations and what the client reports internally as two sides of the same coin. They – they balance each other out. And they’re – they’re both needed. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. So they’re both – they’re both important. Uh, so I think – I think they struggle a little less with documenting what the client reported versus their – you said signs, right. 

00:28:35
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:28:35
SHANNON DERMER Versus documenting signs. I think sometimes are, uh – are, uh, counselors struggle with a little bit more because they’re used to going to the label instead of just -- 

00:28:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER -- doing the – the symptoms. 

00:28:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ And – and a lot of the signs really come down to being mindful of non-verbals.
