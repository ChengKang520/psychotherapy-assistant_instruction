RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker and your host for this series on new perspectives on anxiety treatments. Anyone who's in therapeutic practice knows that the problem of anxiety, if, uh, is right up there and may well be the number one issue that people bring into our offices. Uh, until relatively recently in the studio, um, we have not had methods for dealing effectively and efficiently with the issue of anxiety. And, uh, today, we're going to be, uh, talking about panic disorder and we'll be taking with someone who really has been part of the revolution, one might say, in anxiety treatment that's taken place over the last 35 years or so, a friend of Psychotherapy Networker, frequent, uh, presenter with Networker symposium and a contributor to Psychotherapy Networker; here he is, Reid Wilson. Hey, Reid, how are you? 

00:01:15
REID WILSON. Hey, Rich. Good. 

00:01:20
RICH SIMON So, let's go down, let's start off by going down memory lane a bit. You came into the field, you're an ancient character, like myself, in the mid and late 1970s. Can you start off, what was the, uh, in, your old, your training in working with anxiety disorders and, specifically, panic disorder at that time? 

00:01:45
REID WILSON Well, the interesting thing is I actually came from training in chronic pain patients, so, in the mid '70s, late '70s, all of a sudden, the media started talking about agoraphobia and people with panic disorder came in everybody's door and we knew nothing of what to do about it, but they were way ahead of the game. I happened to, because I worked in chronic pain, knew how to do relaxation training, biofeedback, and such, so, I could start using those skills and very quickly realized those general skills were simply insufficient. They were, they were helpful to take the edge off, but the issue around panic disorder is moment by moment; until we start to figure out how to give somebody instructions moment by moment, we're in trouble. So, that was, really, where I began to do study and look for information to help guide me and, as you can imagine, back then, there was very little there. So, that was, you know, I thank my early clients to allow me to experiment on them. 

00:02:45
RICH SIMON Like, like most of these things. 

00:02:45
REID WILSON I'm still experimenting, I appreciate people waiting around 'til I figure things out. So, that was, really, how it began, to work with people like that. And then, there was a time where, uh, with American Airlines, they were looking for somebody to help them with fear of flying and, so... 

00:03:00
RICH SIMON Really? 

00:03:00
REID WILSON I began to work with them and, uh, and we did a two-day crash course, uh, well, two-day intensive treatment with 25 people. 

00:03:10
RICH SIMON Watch, watch the language, there, buddy. 

00:03:10
REID WILSON Sorry. That, I've never said that before, it kind of slipped out. But, that began to help me shape; how do you change people, help people change rapidly, in a brief period of time, almost like implosion, in some ways. So, that's where my work has been; trying to un-bundle what we think we have to do in cognitive-behavioral therapy, to the lowest common denominators, and then move in that direction. And which, over the years, for me, it's become more and more about more of a cognitive intervention and a strategic treatment intervention, which we can talk about at some point. 

00:03:45
RICH SIMON All right, so, we're going to get, in a moment, we're going to give people a, you mentioned, (inaudible ) how the treatment of panic disorder is a moment by moment process, and a matter of helping people in their moment by moment response to sense of overwhelming, uh, panic. We'll, um, we'll get, uh, uh, a sense of that and we'll, uh, you'll talk about, uh, how you handle, from the get-go, working with someone coming in with a panic disorder. What is, if there are two or three principles that, before we get into the particular, the, the, the technique, the method that you use, uh, from the first session on; if there are two or three principles that you've learned from those early days, moving on from that, your initial training with Gestalt and transaction analysis, and the, the other, uh, the methods that you were taught back in the '70s, and you just had to pick out two or three ideas that are really central to how you think and the model of treatment used, what would those be? 

00:04:50
REID WILSON Well, I think, the first one, in working with clients, themselves, is what you think is the problem is not the problem. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:05:00
REID WILSON That is a huge, huge ship to turn around. So, that's first and foremost. Second, it is go toward what you are afraid of. So, everything leaves from that; it's a, a paradoxical strategy. Who in, on Earth would feel like they were in a near-death experience and relax? It doesn't, just, like, you know, what's the instruction when you get bitten by a rattlesnake? Calmly go to the hospital, all right, so that you're not pumping blood through your body and, and, for the poison (inaudible ), it's crazy. So... 

00:05:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:05:40
REID WILSON Really, I would, I would bring it down to those two things, which is critical to help people is, 'it's not what you think it is.' So that has to do... 

00:05:45
RICH SIMON So the... 

00:05:45
REID WILSON Yes. 

00:05:45
RICH SIMON Go ahead, (inaudible ). 

00:05:50
REID WILSON It's going to take, they have to really trust the therapist. The therapist has to have a tremendous amount of placebo where, because I'm going to try to convince you that what you're afraid of is, you're focusing on the wrong thing. It's the same way with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, you know, it's not about contamination, it's not about running somebody over; here, it's not some subtropical, neurological disease that your caregivers have not identified yet, it's not the precursor to a heart attack, you know, it's other than that. 

00:06:25
RICH SIMON So, this is very different than what many folks in private practice. Um, do people come in? They have a comfortable chat for an hour on some regular basis for their clients? They sort through the ups and downs of the week? There's a, perhaps there's a, a sense of, um, of comfort that gets developed as soon as they come into the office? People, I would imagine, don't get very comfortable as they, when they come into your office, if panic disorder is the, is their presenting issue. 

00:07:00
REID WILSON Well, it's the last thing that you would want because you want to bring the symptoms into the session. So, if somebody comes in with a jacket on and, and immediately starts to take it off, I might ask them to leave it on because they're starting to get warm and a little sweaty, and that makes them feel trapped and uncomfortable. Well, let's, let's stay here, for a minute. So, we do what we call intraceptive exposure; this is David Barlow's work at B.U., and Michelle Craske's, and, and others that, um, that we bring the symptoms into the session. Spin someone around in the chair, have them breathe through a cocktail straw, have them hyperventilate; and I will hyperventilate with them because, when you hyperventilate, you look like a fool, you know. And if your therapist is there with flat affect, watching you, it's, it's intimidating. So, you know, we, we, we want to go after it. When you're having trouble with your client, and they're having trouble applying the skills, bring it in to the session. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So, now, what you do, and, and we're going to look, let's, let's move into it very directly; so, one of the hallmarks of the way you work is, let's go for the symptom, let's, unless proven otherwise, we don't get to get to a, a lot of developmental history, we don't need to make this more complicated than is necessary, you, you, the way you work is very focused and very efficient. So, let's, if we can, let's, let's take a first session; I'm coming in, and my understanding is a lot of, of the peak season of time of life for people coming in with panic disorder are young people 17 to 23. It, it, it, if that's, uh, tell me if that's correct, and if so, why are they the, the, the, uh, the candidates? What, what is there about that particular age group? 

00:08:50
REID WILSON That's the age group where they would have their first panic attack very often. It can come later, but this is the majority of folks. And, you know, we don't exactly know why; my theory is, and others would probably say it, too, is it's a time of uncertainty. People, all people with all anxiety don't tolerate uncertainty very well. So, when I'm in high school, I kind of know what the rules are and I'm breaking them or I'm not. Once I get to college, I can stay up all night, if I want, I can drink as much alcohol, if I want, I can skip classes, and the decision making is no longer clear for me, and when that starts happening, it kind of puts a crack in the defensive system. So, if I'm panic disorder waiting to happen, which is more like what I would think it would be; there's a genetic component in a lot of the anxiety disorders. Then, if I get that critical mass (inaudible ), then it starts to show up at those times. The other thing we look at is six to eight months of stress just before the first panic attack. So, that's the other thing that brings them over the crest. What we look at for the stress tends to be the theme of loss; so, getting divorced or getting pregnant, uh, having a best friend move away, a family member being severly ill. Those types of things bring up a, a threat, for some reason. Some of these people have early childhood loss. So, but we don't have to go through a lot of that developmental stuff. The other thing, I would just say, although we don't need the developmental stuff for the treatment as much, sometimes, we want to go back in the past a little bit, bit to make some sense of why this is happening to me. Because one, I have these intense feelings, you know, it's an on-rush of physical sensations, thoughts of impending doom, and then there's a mystery. I've been to six doctors, you know, everyone says it's anxiety. I think I'm having a heart attack, I go to the emergency room three times; they dismiss me. What's wrong with me? So, so we can put a little bit in context. That, that seems to be helpful to helpful to people, just to give, give them some reassurance; then we can get going. 

00:11:00
RICH SIMON Okay. So, I'm, okay, I'm 22 years old, I graduated from college last year, I'm living with my parents, trying to find a job, and lately, I don't understand what's going on, but I just get in this state. Sometimes it's in my car, it's hard for me to drive my car, I never know when it's going to happen, I can't really tell you what I'm thinking or what's going on, but it's become unpredictable, and the more it happens, I'm, and I'm freaked out. And I'm coming to you on my, my, my parents' urging, uh, and the last thing I want to do is to, but I have no other, uh, recourse, coming to you. And here's a, here's a first session; so give us, if you could, a, a flavor of how it might go and even what you might say at different junctures with how you organize that first contact with a panic disorder client. 

00:12:00
REID WILSON Sure, so, first thing is, well, I'm, we're going to go ahead and make you a girl, all right? Cuz it's such a good description, 85 percent of people with panic disorder are female. So, uh, and, and, so that, that's a very common situation that you're describing. The other thing is, you know, it, the plurality of people with anxiety don't have panic disorder, but people with panic disorder come into treatment more than other anxiety disorders because it becomes so debilitating. If I have social anxiety, I can hide out, but when I can't drive anymore, so forth, so, I want to start by getting rapport with you, which is, 'this is awful. I'm, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Gosh, this is almost like a near-death experience.' The other thing we want to understand is, the definition of panic disorder is 'I lose control. I feel like I have, I, I have no control over my mind or my body. I don't know how to end it.' So, no surprise, given that, that you'd start withdrawing from situations like driving or going to the store or, or being alone. You never know when it's going to hit, but it seems a little related to you feeling trapped, which can either be physically trapped or socially trapped. So, if I'm on the, standing in line at the grocery store, the worst time in standing in line at the grocery store is when I'm being wrung up with the cashier because if I run out at that point, I'll be humiliated. So, if I'm standing in line, five or six people back, I start to feel, suddenly, a sense of anxiety. I have no idea if it's going to turn into a panic attack or if it's not. Maybe it's just my mitral valve acting up. But, if it's a panic attack, I'm going to be humiliated. So, what we're going to find with you, I'm sure, as I talk to you is that with early signs of anxiety, I'm running away. And what happens? I go outside the store, I calm down, my heart rate slows down, I'm feeling better, and then I finish the imagery about what would have happened if I stayed. You know, if I'd stayed in the store, I, my heart would have burst on the split pea cans, thank goodness I left. So, you really get reinforced to leave. So, there's, we're going to start with that kind of rapport and, and support. If I need to go back a little bit to put some pieces together about how it all began, we would do that as well. 

00:14:20
RICH SIMON So, in this early part, then, so, you're giving me, so, uh, right now, in terms of, much of that you would actually, uh, I'm sure you've let the, the client would give you their narrative and give you some, you know, the details and so forth. And, but, part of that early thing is you're putting that, you're saying, 'I understand,' and you're putting that within the context of your experience with other people who have the same issue. 

00:14:45
REID WILSON Right. And when they say, 'where do I start?' I say, 'start with the present, and I'll ask you about the past as I need it.' So, we always start with what's going on, what's your complaint right now? Don't need that other stuff until later on; then I'll back up. So I want to start with that, that's where we're going to pay attention to. For some people, we won't go much further than that. But all that I just said with you takes place in about the first ten minutes. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:15:10
REID WILSON (inaudible ) to know what's, 'now what?' So... 

00:15:15
RICH SIMON So, as I, as, as I'm in, as I'm the, your, and, and, and thank your for the invitation to let my inner feminine emerge, uh, the, um, what you're, what you're saying is I, it feels, uh, I feel relieved that we're going to focus right now, this, it's, it defeats, it, it, it shifts my expectation of, of psychotherapy. 'Oh, God, I'm going to go in and we're going to have to spend all this time' and I am jumping out of my skin with anxiety, and here, I'm hearing you say, 'we're going to focus immediately on your panic attack in the super market or the, you, the fact that you've been increasingly having difficulty getting into your car' or whatever (inaudible ). 

00:16:00
REID WILSON Yeah, and what the therapist wants is to have the client say, when they leave the first session, at least, 'thank God I finally found someone who understands me.' So that, so, the reason you would get rapport (inaudible ) how bad it was, and so forth, answers me, you know, kind of answer their, uh, finish their sentences for them sometimes is you go, 'okay, he gets me. I understand what's going on.' And then, we're going to give you skills pretty immediately, and then, 'you're not going to like this at some level' will be where I go next, some of the things I'm going to say (inaudible ). 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:30
REID WILSON And then, my next thing is I'm going to outline the, the, the principles that keep the disorder living inside them, and then the principles in which to unleash themselves from that. So, I'm, I'm not going to lead with technique; I'm going to lead with principles, belief system, overall view, perspective, and then, then, work my way down to techniques cuz very often, if they can understand what's required of them (inaudible ), they'll invent their own homework. 

00:17:05
RICH SIMON M-hmm. Okay. So, let's, let's, let's break that down and make that quite concrete. So, let's say it's, we, we've had ten minutes, I've unloaded the struggle I'm having in my life, my, these episodes I have of losing control, how terrifying they are. Um, what has lead me, you have, uh, uh, my first experience here, 'oh, this guy gets it. He's finishing my sentences, he's giving me a picture of that.' So, at some point, let's say we're ten minutes into the session and that I've given you a picture of what I'm dealing with and, at what point, at some point, you have enough information to move us into the next stage. So, what is that point, and then, once you're at that point, what's the next stage of the, for treatment? 

00:17:50
REID WILSON Right. And, typically, Rich, it's not that I have enough information, but I've laid the groundwork out enough; I'm not gathering too much information. The next thing I'd go would be, 'when, when was your last pretty tough panic attack? Let's walk me through that event. What was going on before hand, what were you thinking?' So we're going to hear about your anticipatory anxiety. (inaudible ), you don't know if you're going to lose control, you're, uh, tip-toeing into the situation or taking your Xanax to take the edge off. you talk about safety crutches; this is Wells's work around safety behaviors or safety signals. I'm going to do things that take the edge off. I'm going to look for ways to relieve the symptoms, keep them from getting strong, stop them from when, you know, as they start to (inaudible ). I'm going to be listening for all those safe, what I'm going to call safety crutches, which is, you know, they're going to lean on a crutch to get through these things; which has helped them, but we're going to have to peel those away slowly. What I want, in the end, is for us to peel back as many of those crutches as we can, pull back that veil, have them standing, raw-ly, facing the anxiety. The expression I use a lot is, 'then, take the hit.' I've got to be willing to take what it is that I'm afraid's going to happen. 

00:19:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:20
REID WILSON The default, unconscious, if not conscious, position that they are going to enter the room with is, 'look, I will do anything you say. I will be your best student, as long as you'll guarantee I'll have zero symptoms ever again.' So, how do I, how do I prevent this from happening? So, there's that turn that we're going to have to make, which is is your goal is to not let this occur again, we're going to (inaudible ) panic. I will personify panic, and, it's, you know, panic loves to hear that you are in my room trying to figure out how not to have panic anymore. Now, obviously, the goal is to get rid of panic disorder, but the goal and the treatment are different; you've got to be willing to step into it. So, but I'm getting ahead of myself. So, we're going to, uh, find out what that event is like; you want to say anything about what it's like to go into a store, Rich? Or, you want me to... 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON You know, I'm, I'm, I'm there, um, it's, when I get, uh, I begin to feel uncomfortable, especially if it's a crowded store, and, um, moving towards the checkout line and it's, I know it sounds stupid, it sounds silly. 

00:20:40
REID WILSON What do you start thinking? What do you start thinking, in your head? 

00:20:45
RICH SIMON I'm just going to be standing there and I'm just going to get this feeling like I've got to get out of here, and it's ridiculous, I know it. And I'm just, I'm, I feel so ashamed of myself that I just feel like I want to run out the door, and I, I, I would, if I saw somebody like that, I'd think, 'what a, what a crazy person, that is.' But, I'm just, my heart is pounding. I don't know, it's just like, I don't even, sometimes, I don't recognize this person that I've become. I never, I didn't, I wasn't like this. You know, I, uh, six months ago, I wasn't like this, I swear. Um, but, anyhow, I just get scared of things I'm going to do that I never thought were me, and I know it sounds stupid and I try to calm myself down and, you know, you hear about taking deep breaths and relaxation and all that. I try to do the best I can, but, you know, maybe sometimes it works a little bit, but when I'm really in it and I'm getting to that, the checkout line and I, and it's, that's the worst time, where I just, I, I really want to just get out of there and I can feel like I'm jumping out of my skin. And, I don't know, I, I, I don't go shopping anymore, I just don't go to the supermarket. I, I don't want to put myself in that situation. 

00:21:55
REID WILSON Yeah, now, I, you know, Rich, I know that you're a very special person, but I want to tell you the way you just told me is classic. There's nothing special abou that; that is exactly what people with panic disorder go through. And what I want to do right at this moment is jump ahead to what it would be like if you were actually applying what you and I are going to talk about, which is I'm going to be urging you to be able to stay in the store despite all those feelings. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Really? Oh, my. 

00:22:30
REID WILSON That gives you a creepy feeling, I know, but we'll just take it a step at a time. But, what we, what I want you to understand, or as I'll then explain to you, is it, we're, we're not going to pay attention to the symptoms. That's distraction. We want to pay attention to your relationship with the symptoms, which is, right now, I hear it clearly with you, and this is what you're supposed to be saying. You hate the symptoms, you want to get rid of the symptoms, you want them to stop as quickly as possible, you feel humiliated by them, you'll use anything you can to, to, quell them. And I totally get that and it's totally wrong. 

00:23:10
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:23:10
REID WILSON Sorry, totally wrong. So, I want to, uh, I'm going to want you to build skills over these next few sessions that get you to linger. What I want you to experience in a very big way is going into situations between today and the next time we see each other in which, about this theme, let's say, if this seems right to you, the theme is getting trapped, feeling out of control, and feeling terribly uncomfortable. 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON M-hmm. 

00:23:40
REID WILSON So, we want you, uh, what I'm going to ask you by the end of the session is to be finding times during this week where you can generate that feeling to some degree. I don't care how much you do it, I don't care how long you stay. I, I'm fine for you to go in the store and start having these freaked-out feelings and linger for four or five minutes and then walk out. Anything, what we want to focus on is anything where you start to generate the feelings on purpose because, here, here's part of the theme; you currently are a victim of the symptoms. The panic disorder's in control and you're being dominated by it. So, we're going to make a switch where simply by you volunteering to have those sensations, you're beginning to have control back. The message that I'm going to want you to have in, in the end is, 'I can handle these feelings.' So, we want to talk a little bit about to what degree you feel like you can't handle these feelings. What is it you think you can't do? And you can either answer me now, or... 

00:24:55
RICH SIMON Okay, well, let's stay with it. So... 

00:24:55
REID WILSON (inaudible ) 

00:25:00
RICH SIMON I, when I feel like I'm going to burst inside, I, I don't know who this person, who I become, but I just feel I've got no choice. I just feel like I've got to get away. It, it's, it's the most horrible feeling I've ever had in my entire life. I've never felt anything like this before. I had, you know, I would get nervous about things growing up and things I could sure, sure feel scared and tension. But this, I just feel like I, I can't help myself. I've just got to, sometimes, I just can't help myself. I've just got to get away, I just feel like I'm about to explode, I'm going to die if I don't get away. 

00:25:40
REID WILSON Yeah, and so we don't have to worry about that at all. If you're in a situation where you feel like you've got to get away, then get the heck out. I'm not worried about that. What we want to look for, you and I, is how can we create small experiments. In fact, you and I can do that here, if you want, where, you know, I, what physical sensation's most uncomfortable for you? 

00:26:05
RICH SIMON Uh... 

00:26:10
REID WILSON When that happens. 

00:26:10
RICH SIMON Something happens in here, um, where it's like burning and it's like, uh, I'm all sweaty and I'm feeling like I'm going to throw up and I'm going to faint or something. Then it's, I can't even keep track of, so much is happening at the same time. So, it's sort of here and it's, uh, I just, just feel like it's just too much. 

00:26:35
REID WILSON So, would you be willing, at this moment, to, with me, generate a little of that feeling? 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON You, you sure? I mean, and what happens if it gets to be too much? I mean, that, I never thought of doing this before. I... 

00:26:55
REID WILSON Yeah, well, you'll, you'll be in control. Uh, let me tell you what I would suggest that we do. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:27:00
REID WILSON That we, simply, together, take one deep breath and exhale really quickly. That's going to, if you're a little fragile to hyperventilation, you'll probably get a little, few sensations. So, I would encourage this person to do one breath and then... 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:27:15
REID WILSON ...they'll manage that three breaths and it would be three breaths, so that's one, and now just sit and notice what you're feeling. 

00:27:35
RICH SIMON I feel, like, a little relaxed. Or, like... 

00:27:40
REID WILSON Give you the sensations that you'd feel when you start to get panicky? If you're, if you're comfortable with that, we'll do ten. I don't think we're going to do ten, here, because you'll get dizzy and faint and then I'll be talking by myself. So, we would do ten, ten breaths. 

00:27:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:27:55
REID WILSON Quick exhale, get a sense that I can tolerate that little 20-seconds' worth of that. Then, if you, then, we'll just hang out for two or three minutes, they'll recover instantly, it's like two or three minutes. Then, we'll do 30 seconds, and, if I can pull it off in that session, 60 seconds of hyperventilating. And we'll both do it, and I'll be sweating, my heart will be racing and so forth, but they'll have, very quickly, built up from breath to 60 quick breaths and having some of that sensation. This is intraceptive exposure; what we've done is taken the physical sensations that they're afraid of, separated them from their context. I'm not in the grocery store doing it, that's what she was afraid of, and doing it in the office, and then we're doing it very briefly and getting a sense of control. And, the other thing that she gets to learn is, a couple of things; one is, if I do nothing after those 60 seconds of, of quick breathing, if I do nothing, everything comes back to normal. All my sacred cows, all the things I've been doing may be irrelevant... 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Irrelevant. 

00:29:00
REID WILSON And I can still be okay. And, second, is, 'oh, I can voluntary produce these sensations. Maybe it's not some subtropical neurological disease. It's, you know, maybe it's something, if it's under my voluntary control, maybe I can start doing something.' So, here, if she's afraid to do anything, then, so, can, you know, for speeding forward a little bit, can she do some hyperventilation without fleeing? Uh, in that session, we might do it three times. Now, if somebody comes into treatment with panic disorder and in their very first session they do three 60-second hyperventilation experiences and survive, they'll walk out of there feeling different. Like, they've started to make a difference. 

00:29:55
RICH SIMON Something shifted. 

00:29:55
REID WILSON Do something they never expected they could do, and that's the placebo, that's the beginning. Like you were saying before, we want to keep building, building, building on that placebo. 

00:30:05
RICH SIMON Okay. Now, so, at this point, in a first session, where are, where are we? We, are we within the first half hour of your time? About how much time has, has passed in terms of where you want to go with me as your client in the first interview? 

00:30:20
REID WILSON We could be totally done at this point cuz we would have done the breathing and hyperventilating, understood what was going on, begin to think about where she might try this at home, could she do hyperventilation. I might teach her a few other intraceptive exposure practices, we might do one of them, but probably not, this is probably plenty. And the other thing I'm just going to be focusing on, different than typical with most people, is instead of creating a hierarchy and working our way up from the middle to the top or the bottom to the top, is generate uncomfortableness and uncertainty about how it's going to go, to whatever degree I'm willing, in order to sit with it and tolerate it. That, that's going to be our goal. I want to go toward what is, I'm afraid of, and I'm going to do it in small ways to learn as an experiment. These are not techniques to say, 'this is how you're going to get better.' I want you to, like we've done in this session, go home and try it out, come in, take notes about what you did, come in next week, let's talk about it. What did you learn? Let's tweak it. I'll teach you some more things. We'll be very specific about where, you know, then we want to look at what are they motivated to work on? If she's got a job and needs to be driving and she can't have her life partner driving her and picking her up every day, then she's going to be motivated on that and we'll start working on the driving. If she needs to be able to go grocery shopping, so forth, so we'll look for motivation around what might be the easiest to accomplish or what's the most important to get my life back, or what's the one that we can, think we can provoke the distress with. So, but, but the work is more generic. It's like somebody coming in with a fear of flying. I, I like them to have another phobia. If they can be afraid of water and afraid of flying, or afraid of heights and afraid of flying, we can teach the generic skills around heights or around water and then extrapolate from that over to the fear of the plane, assuming it's a panic disorder. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON Let's, so let me, let's stay with this for a sec, so, make sure I get it. So, in this, so, at the end of a, a session, so, in this case, what we've worked on together is my generating a physical sensation of hyperventilation analogous to what I'm complaining to you earlier about that I feel in the supermarket. You've also, um, have, uh, have, have, uh, explained to me the principle of 'take the hit' and that our, our work together is going to be about my ability, not to avoid, but to move towards the thing that, at the moment, makes me intensely uncomfortable and times, and at times, terrifies me. 

00:33:20
REID WILSON Yes. 

00:33:20
RICH SIMON Um, uh, uh, and then at, by the end of the session, in terms of are you, are you giving me, so, those, those, those are two things I've gotten. And then, at the end of the session, are you, are you giving me specific homework assignments to work on? 

00:33:35
REID WILSON I'm giving you assignments as I just described: let's look for, your goal is to look for opportunities. See, here's, it's different from exposure. Exposure is step into a situation that would provoke your distress. What we're switching to is look for opportunities... 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON Seek it out. 

00:33:55
REID WILSON ...to be distressed. So, that's my attitude, which is I won't, you know, what is habituation? Habituation is the, you know, overcoming of fear by exposure to it, and that takes frequency, intensity, duration. If it's, takes me a lot of exposures to get over my fear, then I want a lot of exposures. If it, if I have to be on a scale of, you know, zero to 100, at a 50 or above in distress level, you have my practice count and be useful to me for habituation. I want to have a strong anxious reaction to my exposure. And if it takes 45 to 90 minutes for my mind to start wrapping around the idea that I can handle this, then I want my symptoms to last long enough for it to work. So, you know, if she were having trouble with driving, we might, so we could get very specific about what the practices would be. Like, you know, I want you to go down to the highway and go onto the highway, go down one exit, get off, turn around, come back, and do that over and over again for 45 minutes. 

00:35:05
RICH SIMON Ah, okay. 

00:35:05
REID WILSON Now, I'll tell you what happens after 45 minutes, just to jump ahead, which is by the, you know, after minute 40, they're going, 'can I stop yet?' Right? Cuz they will have, what we would call, within session habituation. How I felt anticipating this event and how it was at the end are much different, much like the hyperventilation would be in the session. Is, I, uh, I don't think I can handle one, and then, all of a sudden, I'm doing it for 60 seconds. My therapist was doing it, too, and he was sweating (inaudible ). 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON So, there are two things here. Let, let, let, let's pull back for a moment, in terms of, cuz this is so at odds with psychotherapy, I think, as many, many of us, the security, the safety of the therapeutic alliance, and so forth. Of course you're, you're, you, you are the figure that's making your sense that you are the guide, that I can believe in you, that what you're implicitly all about is certainly part of this compact, like any, like the, the, a more standard or conventional therapeutic relationship. But, how do you deal with drop, what's the experience of drop-outs, people not coming back after a first session in this kind of work, in contrast to people who are not coming in with anxiety-related symptoms within the context of your treatment approach? Really, it, it is, it is paradoxical; I'm going to go toward something that is going to scare the hell out of me on a regular basis. 

00:36:35
REID WILSON Yeah, okay. Well, two things. One is, you know the data like I do. The average person comes into therapy less than five sessions. 20 percent of people with any disorder get better within that four or less sessions. So, in terms of people bolting therapy, everybody bolts therapy. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:36:55
REID WILSON Second, is most of these people have, you know, seen five psychiatrists over however many years. They may start having panic attacks at 22, but now, they're 35 and have been to four therapists and sat and talked. They want skills, and, and I think they're ready for that. So, I don't think we get people to bolt any quicker, or... 

00:37:20
RICH SIMON Okay, so that's not your experience. M-hmm. 

00:37:20
REID WILSON Yeah, I, I just don't. I mean, again, the (inaudible ) is that I'm looking for somebody who understands, and if they can, uh, if they can trust you, then you can talk as though you know what you're doing. We do that all the time, don't we? 

00:37:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:37:40
REID WILSON So, that's, that's critical, and you can lead in to understanding who they are, what's going on. 

00:37:45
RICH SIMON Okay. So, at the, at the end of the session, so this is how you, you've introduced me to, it's, it's not going to be easy, it's going to be challenging, I'm going to push up against the, my threshold of what, initially, I might consider even impossible, but certainly my threshold of discomfort. I, you're going to give me some tasks to do, some things to, to work on. Um, in terms of this, if, if we pull back, and you give me a sense of, after this first session, where are we going? Are we, basically, doing something like this experience repeatedly, or is there a, uh, are there different phases of this kind of work? Give, give us a sense of, of the kind of, uh, the, the, the sweep of this kind of, uh, approach. 

00:38:30
REID WILSON Listen, Rich, I'm a southerner. We're really simple people. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:38:35
REID WILSON This is, this is it. This is, in essence, this is the theme. We're going to, you know, they're going to come in and they're going to have resisted this, or they tried that and ran away, and we just debrief it, un-, unravel it. 

00:38:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:38:50
REID WILSON We encourage them again, give them another practice, remind them what's going to happen if they don't do any kind of practice. Totally fine with us if they never change. The world can get by if you never get on a plane again. 

00:39:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:39:00
REID WILSON We'll work some about outcome pictures, what is it you're shooting for? Um, trying to model courage for my children. You know, women will come and say, 'I, I feel terrible what's happening with my kids when I'm driving and they see me so nervous.' And I say, 'well, we, you know, we, we can handle that. We will help you teach your kids how to be courageous by you going after some of this stuff.' So, so, we'll certainly get an outcome picture, make sure they've got a good goal, enough. And, you know, if things are slippery, if there's secondary gain, we're going to have to look at that. Sometimes, we'll pull the spouse in, or, or life partner in, teach them skills to practice. Like, for instance, she's having trouble going to, to a big box store. Well, clever little thing; you know, what, what people are trying to prevent is getting too far away from their safety person, so, you know, or, or location, from my house, or whatever. So, if we can have their partner come with them to do a practice instead of waiting outside of Wal-Mart while they go in, and the further they get into Wal-Mart, the more anxious they become, send the safety person in first. Have them go to the back of Wal-Mart, so the further I go into my threatening situation, the closer I'm going to get to my support person. So, all of a sudden, you know, we're, we're messing with things so that they can begin to make a difference. We're going to look at those crutches like medications. So, if they've got Xanax, maybe we will teach them they can take Xanax sublingually. If I take it under my tongue, it goes into effect in about five to ten minutes. If I swallow it, it takes 30 to 45 minutes. So, if I know I can take Xanax, it tastes terrible to do it that way, but if I know I can take it and, and it go into effect in ten minutes, I can hold back from taking it and go and do my practice. We, eventually, need them not to have the Xanax even on their person because we've done some research to show that if I have the option to use a crutch, even if I don't use it, it's pretty much the same. So, for somebody to carry that Xanax in their pocket just in case, eventually, we need to have that gone. 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON Because, because, because it's pretty much the same as what, then? 

00:41:15
REID WILSON As, as taking the, as taking the... 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON Taking it? 

00:41:15
REID WILSON Right. So, there's no difference between taking the Xanax and having it in my pocket. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON No kidding. 

00:41:20
REID WILSON Because I'm, cuz I keep going, 'this could go awry. If it does, I've got this crutch in my pocket that I can use. This could go awry, I've got my cell phone on and my life partner knows that I'm here, at the mall, and I an call her.' You know, those things, we need to be moving those aside, having me not have any of those kind of crutches, to the best of our ability, we don't have to rid you of all crutches, and take the hit. That's, that's the whole thing. People are going to have very subtle, I mean, I've got people with OCD who come in and I have to hold my head still because they'll start to tell a story and they're looking for me to nod my head to ensure them that they've not done anything wrong. 

00:42:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:42:10
REID WILSON They're always seeking out that kind of reassurance. So, we need to understand reassurance is bad news. You know, we don't want to keep going, 'I'm going to be fine, nothing's going to happen, there's no way I'm going to forget my speech, I'll just, I'll be great.' This is not helpful. 

00:42:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:42:30
REID WILSON What we want to do is, 'well, I'm not sure whether I'll remember or not. I'll practice as much as I can, and if I...' 

00:42:30
RICH SIMON Let me see if I get this, Reid. So, John Wayne was right? In some ways, we all need to be down in (inaudible )? 

00:42:40
REID WILSON And he said what? 

00:42:45
RICH SIMON Well, no, John, well, John Wayne, of course, is the embodiment of, you know, hold up to it, this, this is, uh, you know, we have a very soft, uh, uh, the, the, uh, the profile of the therapy client is not what you're describing. This is, the profile of the classic therapy client is you, I come in each week, my therapist puts me back together, I tell my tale of whatever, you know, the, the struggles all week are. I feel better because I, you know, let it go and, and that relationship regulates me and I go out into the world and come in, perhaps, next week and have a chat and feel better and reassured and the parental thing. But you're, what you're describing, here, goes counter to that culture. 

00:43:30
REID WILSON Oh, yes, and the other, here's the other caveat, which is probably half the therapists who work in the field of anxiety disorders work in it because they have a great affinity for the problems, and in some way can relate to it. And those therapists tend to be too soft. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:43:45
REID WILSON Much better to have a risk-taker as your therapist. Just like trying to get off of Benzodiazepine, if you go to a doctor who's very loving and caring, you know, they'll, it's, often, it'll take you forever to get off the Benzodiazepine. If you get somebody who's a little more, you know, 'this is how you do it. Go at it. You can take it. Let's go.' That placebo is healthy to people. So, you've got to be tougher around 'let's try it anyway' kind of attitude. And if you're, got too much rapport with their suffering, you are not that helpful to them. 

00:44:20
RICH SIMON So, in terms of understanding the kind of relationship that you develop with your client, the, the, uh, uh, analogy that suggests itself is much more like the coach who's pushing the athlete, or whatever you happen to be. So, the coach, like, I, I have written some about this on the Networker blog, I have a, even at my advanced age, I'm still, um, I still play basketball, and I got this idea that maybe I could add a few tricks to my game. So, I have a coach, 25-year-old kid, pushes me, yells at me, tells me he's, he is not sweet and easy with me, at all, and he also, like you're describing, he act, he knows what my real limits are, as opposed to what I think my limits are. And the, the, the art is to push me towards limits, not that I'm Superman, but I'm, it's beyond the, the, the limits I might, on my own, not exceed. So, so, what you're describing is very much that, that's, that's more your role rather than what (inaudible ) thinks of as the classic nurturing therapist role. 

00:45:30
REID WILSON Right, and that's exactly how I teach it to other therapists and how I present it to clients. This is a, a game, this is a mental game. Your, your challenger has come on dressed in black and white stripes as though she is the official in the game. And they will give you rules that guarantee they'll win every time. And, so, I am going to be your coach. And, you know, world-class athletes go around the, the world and pay a lot of money to coaches, and if they say they'll give me, you know, run the stadium steps, and then we'll do some wind sprints, very unlikely that that athlete's going to say, 'you know coach, I got a little tummy ache today, could we do something else?' 

00:46:10
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:46:10
REID WILSON They'll say, 'yes, coach, I'm going.' So, so, coaching is a, is a great metaphor for it, and, also, you, you've got to be doing things that you think you can't do. That's, that's it. If, if you've ever done rock climbing; you know, to, to, to try to take a step when I'm four feet off the ground, versus I'm 15 feet off the ground, the exact same step, it's remarkable, when I lift up 11 more feet, how I've become completely incapacitated. It's like that. So, like you said, your coach knows your limits more than you do. 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:50
REID WILSON And pushes you. 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, here's the other piece of this; if one specialty is, as, as yours is panic disorder, but the range of anxiety disorder, and we'll, in a moment, we're going to talk about how this fits into your broader framework of working with anxiety disorders, um, what's the toll of this work? To be around people who, uh, one after the other are, uh, just the, the, the vibe, here, the, the, the mirroring, all the neuro-biological neutral regulation that goes on? Tell us a little bit about what it's like to be a therapist who specializes, not only in anxiety disorders, but you're pushing people to move towards, beyond this, their threshold of comfort over and over again in the course of a day. And, and perhaps how that's changed over the years, for you, in all the years you've been doing this kind of work; what you've learned about doing it. 

00:47:45
REID WILSON This is going to sound terrible, but it's so much fun. I, I, I totally love working... 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:50
REID WILSON ...with the, and, you know, my favorite disorder, right now, is OCD because they're so incredibly locked in to a point of view. And what, you know, I'm 60, so, I, I'm, for me to get to figure out how to help people change their minds is great fun. I, I enjoy it, and my, my work is how to unbuckle it, what's the lowest common denominator of intervention that we can use, how quick, I've been doing self-help since I was 16, so, really, my passion is self-help, which is to give the information to the consumer. 

00:48:30
RICH SIMON The tools that they... 

00:48:30
REID WILSON they can control. Yeah, and not be in a dominant, one, you know, I'm very dominant, and I'm absolutely one up in, in many, many ways in the work, and simultaneously, in the same session, I'm going to be one down. I'm going to be curious, un-, uh, even shrugging my, you know, my favorite physical gesture is that, 'I don't know, let's see if we can find out.' You know, or, 'I wonder.' So, there's a, a lot of that... 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:49:00
REID WILSON ...extreme accessing curiosity and trying to figure out, what, you know, again, what we know. What we're up against is it's very expensive to come in to therapy. You've got to get off work, it takes time, it costs money. And for a lot of the people that we work with, the therapists are explaining this principle, uh, that's a kind of a long-term principle, which is, you know, if you'll do exposure and repeat the pattern over and over again without doing your, your rituals and so-forth, you will get better. Well, that's great, but you lose rapport with your client because you're talking about long-term work, your client is focusing on the moment. I'm suddenly terrified; I need to know what to do right now. So, I'm trying to get better at matching what we explain as the rationale for treatment to what's going on with the patient. And, it is so hard to do what they're doing. I, you know, what I try to do is say, 'look, this is, it is not complex. What you need to do is not complex. It's difficult, but it's not complex.' That, so, you know, again, I'm having a great time. 

00:50:15
RICH SIMON Okay. So, let's, so, at the point at which therapy ends is, what is the, what does the client look like? So, so, um, it, it's not as if they don't have a, a, a permanent, um, immunity to feeling anxiety. What, give it, give us, kind of, the flavor. At the end of the process, and we're talking, in, in this moment, for the moment, I'm talking about broadly; but with panic disorder, what seems, what in your experience is the, uh, therapeutic termination point when somebody has worked through a, panic disorder? Is it that, behaviorally, they can put themselves in situations that they were avoiding before and they're within a permissible level of, as far as they're concerned, of, uh, discomfort in going to the supermarket, driving their car, being in the elevator, doing whatever it is that was previously triggering the panic disorder? 

00:51:15
REID WILSON Well, I, interesting, all those questions. You know, a couple things; I don't, during treatment, I don't care whether anybody has a panic attack or not, what I want them to do is be willing to have a panic attack. When they're all better, a few things need to happen. One is they need to know that anxiety disorders run a life cycle. So, you can do great with me, finish treatment in X number of sessions, be off and be fine, and then, two years later, you're hit with something else again, or panic again. The problem with being better is you drop your skills. You, you, you let them go cuz you don't need them anymore. Then, you get hit with another spontaneous panic attack, and you flip out and forget everything and bolt again, and you've to brush your skills off and put them on again, and start using them. So, you know, my, one of my goals is to make sure those skills are pretty solid and simple so they don't have to, necessarily, come in and work with me again in order to get up and running. The message I want people to have when they walk out is 'whatever happens, I can handle it.' What happens in the middle of the treatment is, you know, okay, on a scale of zero to ten, I, I think I can do pretty well with a, the number seven panic and, and, and maybe even a number eight, I can manage it. I hope it doesn't get up to a number nine. Well, you can't get there from that position because you never know how strong your symptoms are going to be when you have a panic attack. If I have a number ten panic, I'll go insane for a few moments and fall apart, somebody will take care of me, and I'll recover eventually, and I can handle that, too. So, so that's what we're looking for, and then they need to, you know, the, behaviorally, they need to be expanding their life and have free movement, not be preoccupied with obsessions all day long, not be doing a bunch of rituals and, and compulsions in order to control their symptoms and so forth, and be willing to have their symptoms. I, I wouldn't say that everyone who finishes no longer is anxious, but I would say they're no longer passive. So, I don't mind you continuing to have distress and anxiety, but I want your activity level to have tripled. So, I'm, you know, what, what the very passive act, life, you see, people can, can be fine as long as they don't do anything. And, so, we really want them doing the things despite the distress and then not having full-blown panic attacks anymore. Well, you know, they're still having full-blown panic attacks, they're not done, we haven't done the job. 

00:54:00
RICH SIMON Okay. Yeah, so, they, so the, the, the termination point is more their, a coping skill, rather than a, it's certainly not the, the total elimination of the discomfort. But, it's, it's, as you said earlier, just like, as you defined the problem, it's the response to a, a considerable and often extremely unpleasant level of discomfort. But the real, the, the, if you do the, uh, an evaluation of outcome, it would be the real, the real change is in the coping response and, uh, and some... 

00:54:35
REID WILSON That is what, that's why the symptoms diminish. It's because I'm no longer throwing fuel onto the fire. If I go in to the dentist and have to have three injections of Novocaine, and all of a sudden, I get panicky, which I've had happen before. You, you know, for a moment, I don't know what's going on. Well, they might have an experience like that, but they need to be able to step back and go, 'I know what this is, I can manage this.' So... 

00:55:00
RICH SIMON So, as we move, here, we have about five minutes to go, uh, just briefly, how does what you've been describing, through this series we're going to talk about the range of variations on the theme of anxiety, great theme of human experience, um, and, and how your approach, and, so, you'er, have written about and you're, uh, very well versed in treating a whole range of anxiety disorders. What might you say about the, the relationship, uh, the similarity and difference between what we've been talking about, uh, here, with panic disorder, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, OCD? What are the similarities and difference, to give people a frame of reference in the, at the boarder of the spectrum of anxiety. 

00:55:45
REID WILSON Okay. Well, let's start with the similarities because the differences may, we'll, the clock will tick right out. Similarities; here are the four principles. The content is irrelevant; what I am worrying about is not relevant to the treatment. If I have generalized anxiety disorder and I have lost my job and there's a chance, in three months, that I will not be able to pay the rent and won't be able to keep the house, that theme is, is relevant to me, personally. But, the sub-routine of worrying, obsessing about it all day long, has to do with my anxiety disorder, not about not being able to pay the bills. So, we have to get off the dot around the content. Same with OCD; content's irrelevant, it's not about germs, it's not about not locking the door, and so forth. Second, accept the obsession when it pops up. When my worry shows up, be okay that it came, not, 'oh, I just had a thought that I might molest a child. Oh, well, I won't do it much.' It's not about the content. It's about, 'oh, yeah, I've got, you know, I've got an anxiety disorder, this is what we do; we generate thoughts to scare the bejeezus out of us.' So, in the context of the disorder, it's fine I just had that thought because it's meaningless and purposeless. It's not predictive of what's going to happen next. Third, seek out uncertainty. Seek it out. Don't, don't tolerate it, seek it out. If you seek out uncertainty, you're going to feel anxious. So, the last is seek out distress. And when distress shows up, you go, 'I was looking for this.' I mean, notice how that just flips everything around. When uncertainty comes, like, okay, I'm, I'm, this is what, I eat uncertainty for breakfast. And that's the, that's where we're going to start to move in that direction. 

00:57:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:57:45
REID WILSON So, those four things are there. Then, we've got, you know, with social anxiety, very specific things around the critical eye of other people, around normal activities. People, uh, with social anxiety have this interesting thing because they think the criteria to be allowed into the tribe is, is very high and the criteria for being kicked out is very low. Well, that's totally wrong. 

00:58:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:05
REID WILSON To be let in the tribe, you don't have to be smart and clever, or, you don't even to talk a lot. You have to treat people with respect, and you'll be able to. And the way you get kicked out of the tribe is be a jerk. Being narcissistic... 

00:58:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:20
REID WILSON ....uh, focused on yourself, and you have to do that in extreme. And, so, they've got that all flipped around, and we've got to flip that back around. 

00:58:30
RICH SIMON So, there's some social learning, there. That, that's, that's (inaudible ). 

00:58:35
REID WILSON That's still from evolutionary psychology. And so, so, we, we've, but all the principles are the same, it's just that, with social anxiety, I've got to be doing some kind of social interaction at the same time I'm having these overwhelming feelings. With panic disorder, I can be by myself, no one knows it's happening. I'm trying to introduce myself when I have social anxiety, so that is trouble and, a lot more to say about that. I think, I mentioned a few about OCD. It's, the content's irrelevant. 

00:59:00
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:59:00
REID WILSON Generalized anxiety disorder, a lot of it is about distal worries; that it's, it's coming up later on, which makes things a little different than somebody with panic disorder. It's immediate, so the time is a little different. And with anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety is really the only disorder that I still teach (inaudible ) relaxation. There's a whole paradigm that I work with to try to help people get that balance, but it's still, think about, you know, noise versus signals. This, there's a principle that I use with everybody all the time; you keep thinking these obsessions, are, are, are signals, and what you need to do is define them as noise. Then, we can manipulate them in lots of ways. We can sing them, we can write them down, we can put them on a leaf and float them down the river, we, right? But if I think it's a signal, I keep going to the emergency room and they say, 'you're not having a heart attack,' you know, if I do it three times, I don't go to the emergency room anymore because I'm too embarrassed, but I sit at home and go, 'oh, my God, I think I'm having a heart attack.' That's crazy, and that's what we've got to fix, (inaudible ) noise versus signals. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON Now, one thing, and then, and then, um, maybe this is, then we'll, um, shift to the, the, the, the very conclusion of this. So, mindfulness has been proposed as the be-all and end-all. You can hardly have an article about, you certainly can't go to a, a psychotherapy conference these days and not have just about every presentation have some reference to mindfulness practice as, as being helpful and be healing. So, in your view, what's the, what is it that mindfulness contributes to helping people cope with various anxiety conditions, what are the limitations of anxiety practice? 

01:00:40
REID WILSON Well, uh, you know, the, the, the benefits are tremendous. Mindfulness is a, is an essential tool that everyone needs to master, which is, 'I need to step back, away from my thoughts, be an observer of my thoughts,' I was writing about that in "Don't Panic" in 1985. Uh, so, so, that, that's essential, and, to get some perspective, the piece that anxiety disorders miss is that it is a compassionate distant observer, and, so, and very often, they don't have that piece. What's missing, I think that those who teach it teach it well, those who learn it sometimes miss the piece; that mindfulness is useful, but insufficient because, in a threatening situation, just like in the emergency situation, I must operate on command. I must say, step into the, that bathroom. You know, speak, uh, and I have to tell myself what to do because, by default, my fear tells me to back away. If you think about police forces, the military, uh, surgery, operating rooms, pilots in, in commercial aircraft; everybody who's in a threatening situation operates by command. There's almost 85 commands that are given by the first officer and the captain before the plane even takes off. The captain will say something and the first officer will say it back. So, that's what, really, I'm trying to focus on now, is train myself, if I'm the patient, about what to say in the moment that will override my fearful thoughts. I'm not trying to banish my fearful thoughts, I'm trying to have a competing voice. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON M-hmm, okay. All right, uh, we've covered a lot of ground, here, and, um, for folks out there who are interested in learning more about your approach and, uh, clinical materials that, and resources that, uh, might be available on your website, training opportunities, things to read, what should they turn to? 

01:02:50
REID WILSON Well, I, as I said, I, my, my focus is on self-help, so I do have a website called anxieties.com, plural. It is, basically, my dad, may he rest in peace, said, 'you're giving everything away. You can't give everything away.' But, it's, it's a, a resource for people, they can go on there, send their clients there to learn about all the different ways to treat anxiety in a self-help, uh, focus. So, I, I encourage people to go there and let their clients go there and learn something new. We've got about 35 thousand new people every month on that website, so it's a pretty active website, and after 13, 14 years on the internet, um, we are revamping it all in the last six months, so I, now, since this is the future, uh, it, it is up and running. So, I encourage people to go there and they can click on my workshops and know where I'm teaching this stuff around the country, elsewhere. 

01:03:50
RICH SIMON Anxieties.com? 

01:03:50
REID WILSON Right. 

01:03:50
RICH SIMON Okay, great. All right, and so, um, as we come to a conclusion, here, we want to invite people to take a moment to, for their own sake, as individuals, just put into language what we've learned here. Take the active approach that Reid has been talking about and that's the, the homework of the, the, uh, the, his, the work with anxiety or with panic disorder is just; What stood out for you? What'd you learn? What questions you had, what connections you made in the course of listening to this? Let's continue the conversation, each of us, as individuals, if you put it into language and put it down, it's good for you. Sharing it with a group is good for all of us, so let's continue the conversation. What an extremely provocative conversation it's been. Reid has agreed to look at the comment board, where appropriate, the, your, if it's your lucky day, he may well, well respond by the, at the very least he will be checking out the comment board and I really urge everybody who, who has, uh, registered for this webcast to check out these comment boards for this and all the other sessions; it's a really important part of the online experience. Reid, my friend, uh, I just, a, a very empowering, uh, as, as, as your client, I feel challenged, I feel like I'm tougher than I thought, I'm more resourceful than, uh, than I am. Maybe I can hang out in that supermarket and maybe, if I do it five minutes today, maybe seven minutes tomorrow, so there's something, uh, about this, this coaching, slash, therapeutic approach, and I think, uh, speech is something really essential in the process of change. Thank you, so much, for being so clear and offering us such practical tools. 

01:05:35
REID WILSON Thanks, Rich. And do, um, 30 seconds of hyperventilating and then practice basketball. 

01:05:40
RICH SIMON Okay, I will. I, uh, I, uh, and I'll, I'll call you in the morning. Thanks so much. And thanks to all of you for being part of today's conversation. See you next time. Bye, bye.
