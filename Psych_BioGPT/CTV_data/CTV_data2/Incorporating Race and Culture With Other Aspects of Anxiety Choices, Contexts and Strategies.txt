And Multicultural Development MICROTRAINING The 24th Annual Teachers College Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education PRESENTS: Marie L. Miville, Ph.D. Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY Incorporating Race and Culture With Other Aspects of Identity: Choices, Contexts, and Strategies 

00:00:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE  Thank you, Gerald(ph). And, I just would like to say, I don't think anybody could ever be your boss. But, thank you for honoring me that way. (Laughs). Well, good morning everyone and thank you for your patience with the, some of our technical difficulties but we are just going to move on through and, and have this presentation. I'm so honored to be here this morning. I'd like to start out this morning by telling you the stories of two women who have been very important to me in my personal professional life. When I was a young woman on the verge of coming out, I came upon the writings of an amazing woman, Audre Lorde. 

00:00:55
 That's right. 

00:00:55
MARIE L. MIVILLE To use her words, Audre was a black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet. One of her most famous sayings, "When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I'm afraid," has been the source of great inspiration to me from the moment I heard it. Now, to look at Audre's life, you might say that she had much to fear. Audre grew up in Harlem, New York in the 1930's, the child of immigrant parents from the West Indies. They were Catholic and very spiritual and they raised Audre and her sisters according to it's, some ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
 (Coughing) 

00:01:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE - priest-strict rules. Audre's parents also experienced American racism for the first time which she describes as a new and crushing reality that her parents had to deal with from the moment they stepped foot on this land. In her biomythography, Audre describes an incident when her newly arrived parents came to this country and they were able to get Audre's mother a job as a maid in the Waldorf Astoria in the location that is now actually where the Empire State building stands. Ah, for one week, Audre's mother was sick, and by the way, she got the job because she was light skinned enough to pass as a Latina. Well, one day, ah, Audre's mother was sick and so she couldn't go to work and her father, ah, went instead to get some personal items. Well, one of these hotel managers saw her, ah, saw him, identified him as a man of African descent and Audre's mother was fired on the spot, no severance pay, no recourse, no second chance. Well, just hold, just a moment please. You ready? Okay. Now on the face of these harsh realities, Audre recalls being raised with the term powerful woman, as a child. Now, this term, powerful and woman, in tho, in those days were rarely linked with each other. In fact, Audre talks about that the term woman was often associated with- (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
 (Coughing) 

00:03:10
MARIE L. MIVILLE - things considered aberrant, and to use her words like, blind, crazy or black. The first person that Audre experienced as a powerful woman was her own mother. And she wrote about the ways that even total strangers approached her mother for something as simple as a cut of red meat and asked for her opinion. That there was just something about the way that Audre's mother carried herself that signified a sense of power. And, there was this early experience with powerful women of color that Audre felt there was always black lesbians around "in the sense of powerful and women-oriented women." So, you already hear that Audre, being black, female, lesbian- (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
 (Coughing) 

00:03:55
MARIE L. MIVILLE - each and together signify the sense of her empowerment, her sense of self knowledge, and her i, own identity. And while the larger society never recognized Audre for all of who she is, instead preferring to break her down into little bits and pieces, usually characterized as bad pieces, she absolutely did not accept this. She wrote, there's always, ah, a someone asking you to underline one piece of yourself whether it's black or woman, mother, dyke, teacher, et cetera. But once you do that, once you do that, you've lost because you become acquired or bought by that particular essence of yourself. 

00:04:45
 (Coughing) 

00:04:45
MARIE L. MIVILLE And you denied yourself all of the energy that it takes to keep all those other aspects of yourself in jail, in jail. So, in other words, it takes so much energy to lock up parts of yourself for whatever reasons, whatever fears, even if you're afraid that unleashing those aspects of yourself will lead to deep trouble and terrible loss. You still lose. You still lose. And, as she writes, only by learning to live in harmony with your contradictions, can you keep it all afloat. The question is a matter of survival. That's what our work comes down to. That's what my work comes down to. No matter where we key into it. It's just the same work, just different pieces of ourselves doing it. Now, the later time, Audre Lorde was given the African name Gamba Adisa, meaning warrior. She who meek, makes her meaning clear. I think you'll all agree that Audre Lorde, today, speaks with the clarity that's still powerful. A second person I wanted to talk to you about is Cherrie Moraga. And, she writes, "I am a Chicano lesbian. My own particular relationship to being a sexual person and a radical stand in direct contradiction to and in violation of, the women I was raised to be." Now, Cherrie was born in California in the early 1950's, a time when Chicanos were segregated in many social arenas. Much like other racial ethnic groups, African-Americans in the South and many other parts of this country were also segregated. 

00:06:30
 (Coughing) 

00:06:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE  As a matter of fact, during the time that Cherrie was a baby in the 1950's, a very important court case was decided with concerning the desegregation of schools for Chicanos in California. 

00:06:45
 (Coughing) 

00:06:45
MARIE L. MIVILLE In that case, actually, it was used as of,- (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
 (Coughing) 

00:06:50
MARIE L. MIVILLE - as a very important base for the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Board ah, Brown versus the Board of Education. Now, Cherrie was formally educated and if you just, ah, think about the, the court case I told you about, as well as the statistics on education on Latinos even today, that is actually quite a very unusual feat. And, as she writes, she wore it with a keen sense of pride and satisfaction. "My head propped up with the knowledge from my mother that my life would be easier than hers. I was educated but more than this, I was,- (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
 (Coughing) 

00:07:25
  Sorry. 

00:07:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE - but more than this, I was la guerra, fair-skinned, born with the features of my Chicano mother but the skin of my Anglo father," she thought she had it made. So, the reactions of Cherrie's, ah, family to racism were quite different than Audre's family. There was more than minimization of race, of color, of culture. And going for so much, the so called, U.S. gold of education,- (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
 (Coughing) 

00:08:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE - of wealth, and presumably of- (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
 (Coughing) 

00:08:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE - power, in short, Cherrie's family minimized race because they could. Now, no one ever told Cherrie that light was right but she picked up from that fact from her family. She wrote, "In fact, everything about my upbringing attempted to bleach me of whatever color I had. Although my mother was in, ah, fluent in it, I was never taught much Spanish at home. It was through my mother's desire to protect her children from poverty and illiteracy, that we became "anglicized." Can you note(ph)?. The more effectively we could pass in the white world, presumably, the better guaranteed our future." Okay. Right now? All right, so now we get to catch up a little bit. 

00:08:50
 Uh hmm(ph). 

00:08:50
MARIE L. MIVILLE  Oh you will, all right, ah, if you could forward it a couple of slides. That was her quote. Ah, next slide, a couple more hits, next slide, okay. Well, we'll take it from there. Thank you. Okay. So, what was wrong with this picture? Okay, she was presumably going to be passing, how did Cherrie truly feel about herself as a woman, as a Latina, and soon to be a lesbian? She talks about experiencing on a daily basis "a huge disparity" between, between what she born into and what she was to grow to become. In fact, it was when Cherrie came out as a lesbian that she also came out as a feminist identified woman and as a Chicana embracing her brown skin heritage. These aspects of identity were not separate for ch, ah, Cherrie. Indeed, learning about acknowledging the reality of her feelings and thoughts, as a woman-loving woman, helped her to embrace her racial ethnic sense with pride. Cherrie discusses that when she finally came out as a lesbian, a profound connection with her mother reawakened. She wrote, "to la via sola hija de mi mama," I'm always my mother's daughter. It wasn't until she says, I acknowledge and confronted my own lesbianism, in the flesh, that my heart felt identification with, and empathy for my mother's oppression as a poor woman, as uneducated and as a Chicana, was realized. My lesbianism is the avenue through which I have learned the most about silence and oppression. So, again, it wasn't until Cherrie was able to connect these disparate aspects of her self- (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
 (Coughing) 

00:10:50
MARIE L. MIVILLE - that she began to experience wholeness. And this fragmentation just didn't happen in a vacuum. Indeed, after she came out as a lesbian, a Chicana lesbian, her sense of wholeness was often not supported by others. She writes, "to whose camp should the lesbian of color retreat?" Her very presence violates the ranking and obstruction of oppression. Cherrie describes a conversation she once had a one, with a white gay male friend who said, he didn't think she'd ever trust him, ah, because he was male. So, she thought about it for a second and went, well, okay, maybe you're right. But I want you to think about this and, and for those of you,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
 (Coughing) 

00:11:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE - who, who are not female, think about this for a second. Imagine what it would be like to be a woman for a day. What would that feel like? Well, he confessed that the thought absolutely terrified him. It absolutely terrified him because he felt as a woman; he'd be a potential target for violence, even for rape. But Cherrie pointed out to her, to him, and if these were in these days, he, she would have said, hey dude, uhm, in fact, you're already- (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
 (Coughing) 

00:12:10
MARIE L. MIVILLE - a target. You're a gay man and you have been targeted for violence, if you could forward the next slide? So, in other words, to develop authentic alliances, you must deal with the primary source of your own sense of oppression, what it feels like to be a victim, whatever that source of oppression might be. Now, I can say that oppression comes in many shapes and sizes, even something as seemingly innocuous as hair. And, every woman of color in this audience, actually, every person in this audience probably understands this, that there are so many terms for classifying and talking about hair. Most significantly is that there's such a thing as bad hair. These are ways that the larger society demeans us. Makes us feel like outsiders for something as completely natural as our own hair is deemed as nasty or foreign or worse. Now, I'm working with my wonderful research team. Some of you are here. Please raise your hand and be recognized. Whoo-hoo! 

00:13:15
 Whoo-hoo! (Clapping). 

00:13:20
MARIE L. MIVILLE And we're starting a project this year looking at how people's experiences with their hair, actually discuss, ah, their own stories of oppression. And, how they've triumphed and overcome these uttering experiences, as based on race or ethnicity or gender, class. The journey to find the right hair stylist who will not burn your hair off along with your personal dignity, ah, makes up some very powerful and actually quite common narratives. Now, think for a minute; if we can have the next slide, where your areas of oppression are. How, where, when, have you felt like a victim? Where and what is your deep, dark pain? Where does it come from? 

00:14:10
 (Sneezing) 

00:14:10
MARIE L. MIVILLE How have you sought healing from this pain? Have you felt like a victim, as a person of color, as a woman, as a gender-bending person, such as, the Speaker of the House or a sensitive man, not a gay man but just a sensitive man, a transgendered person, an LGB sexual minority person, a low income person, a curly-haired person? If you've even been divorced or a child of divorced parents, now, you might be wondering, what about this last piece, how does that fit into this list? Uhm, it doesn't seem politically, socio-politically based, but, you know, I was raised in Miami,- (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
 (Coughing) 

00:15:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE - a very conservative, ah, community during the time of Anita Bryant, ah, and I also lived in, for a time in s, ah, small town in the Midwest. And I can tell you that being from a divorced family is actually a socio-political oppression, ah, experience. I knew women who moved from their towns ah, when they got divorced because they can never socially overcome being, you know, "that divorced woman." So, I would also add, in addition to understand your sources of, of, of oppression, you must also ask, what are your sources of privilege? What are your resources and your power bases, how, that you're not willing to relinquish? What do you fear by letting go of these powers? So, in other words, being a person of color is not just a straight thing. Being a sexual minority is not just a white thing, next slide and the next slide, being a feminist is not just a white or even a female thing. And I love that photograph. It's about understanding the impact of power, privilege and oppression as lived experiences. It's about finding words for these experiences and connecting with similar others for by articulating and sharing our stories that we bridge up of our internal pain and to find love and connection with others. I mean, that's what it's all about, right? Bridges can be built from many materials but they all share, of course, that important commonality of connecting one thing with another, one part of yourself with another part, one person with another person, one group with another group and so on. So, what does this all have to do with psychology and education? Uhm, much more can multicultural psychology and counseling has focused on identity development and how being a member of a social group such as race or ethnicity has had a profound effect on our psychological functioning. But, what do we mean by identity? And I really like the quote up here by Gloria Saldua. "Identity is not a bunch of little cubby holes stuffed respectably with intellect, race, class, sex, class, vocation, gender. Identity is a river, a process. Contained within the river is its identity and it needs to flow, to change, to stay a river." So, in other words, identity changes and it stays the same all at the same time, all at once. 

00:17:40
 (Sneezing) 

00:17:40
MARIE L. MIVILLE - Can you imagine trying to measure that? Next slide, and Gloria also talks about la busque, ah, la busqueda iden, ide, iden, identerar, ah, the search for identity. How queer is queer? And she writes that she's often asked, what is your primary identity? Are you a lesbian? Are you a working class person? Are you a Chicana? And, she felt similarly the way that Audre Lorde talks about it, that to put each in a separate compartment is to put them in a contradiction with each other in isolation. When in actuality, they're all in a constantly shifting relationship and dialogue. 

00:18:25
 (Coughing) 

00:18:25
MARIE L. MIVILLE In short, all aspects of identity are part of or(ph) for her, the term lesbian. Now, this is a radically different approach to how di, identity development has been defined and researched in psychology. Most identity models, ah, they focus exclusively on a single dimension of identity, such as your race,- (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
 (Coughing) 

00:18:45
MARIE L. MIVILLE - or your gender. They describe developmental stages or markers that characterize change. They examine, ah, a kinda st, your status and oppression issues but as Audre, Cherrie and Gloria have all said, a focus on one, just one dimension, ah, might recapitulate social oppression. That may not reflect, really, how identity development has actually occurred and that, in fact, these dimensions may develop, grow, not grow simultaneously and even interconnectedly. I think the next, okay, and then the next slide. So, today, in psychology there's an absence of complex and comprehensive models that focus on two or more, ah, identities. And, that part of these, uhm, we might say, one might say, is a presumption that there's a hierarchy of balance(ph) of oppression, that some experiences are more important to focus on than others. And, if we can say that about yourself and it may be true about that for yourself, can you assume that about the person sitting next to you? Okay, next slide. So, consider the word sexism. What does that mean to you? Whom do you think are the targeted group? Look at this picture. So, who is the person, person you imagined? Did you envision a woman of color as a target of sexism? Are women of color targets of sexism, and if so, by whom? The answers are quite difficult to acknowledge or talk about. Consider what the word racism means to you. Whom do you think of as the targeted group? Imagine- (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
 (Coughing) 

00:20:40
MARIE L. MIVILLE - being a woman around this table, being a woman of color, being a lesbian woman of color around this table. What are your desires and goals? What are your fears and concerns? What barriers or threats might you be exposed to? What strategies will you use to seek your goals to overcome those barriers? Next slide. So now, consider what the word homophobia means to you? Whom do you think of us as a targeted group? What images come to you, to your mind and how do these reflect what we see in the media and elsewhere? And if you could hit(ph), hit that one more time. We very much know the images on the left, I watch that every week. But, so often, who we are, are more reflected in the images on the right. So, where does this all play out for us, in terms of how we think about? How we intervene as mental health professionals and educators, with things like homophobia, racism, sexism? Even more difficult and painful to deal with are "isms" from our own communities. The wonderful Audre Lorde has yet another quote. "When I picketed for Welfare Mother's Rights and against the enforced sterilization of young black girls, when I taught institutionali, lized racism in the New York City schools, I was a black lesbian. But, you did not know it because we did not identify ourselves." So, now, you can say that black lesbians and gay men had nothing to do with the struggles of the black nation. A lesbian woman from Peru, next, go, and I'm sorry I don't have her name, also spoke it similarly about her rights for indigenous peoples in Latin America, "When I speak of my right to own my own culture and language as an indigenous woman everyone agrees to my right to self-determination. But, when I speak of my other identity, my lesbian identity, my right to love to determine my own sexuality, no one wants to listen." And then, finally, most poignantly, from Joseph Bean, he writes, "When I speak of home, I mean not of the familial constellation from which I grew but the entire black community, the black press, the black church, black academicians, the black literary and the black left. Where is my reflection? I am most often rendered invisible, perceived as a threat to the family or if I'm tolerated or I am tolerated, if I'm silent and inconspicuous. I cannot go home as who I am and that hurts me deeply." Now, gay men of color also speak of the trans(ph) racism that exist in the larger LGB communities and of often being sexually objectified, reduced to body parts, indeed. I, ah, recently googled the term black gay men, I was just kinda curious to see what I come up with- (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
 (Coughing) 

00:23:55
MARIE L. MIVILLE - and nine out of 10 sites came out as some kind of sexualized site. So, uhm, you know, it's, it's just one of those difficult situations of where is your home. Now, I will like to say about Joe Bean, he died of AIDS in 1988. And he actually this, this, ah, picture here is the cover of the book that he managed to have published posthumously with the help of his parents. His parents were responsible for getting this book, one of the first ever for black gay men, ah, published on anthology. So, you know, there's hope. There's so many ways to build bridges and your messages and stories can and do have impact. So, it's safe to say in the larger society when psychologists have explored the impact of "isms." It's typically been one "ism" at a time. And of course, there's a lot of good reasoning for that. As I said earlier, imagine trying to reduce all this complexity of experiences down to some kind of a meaningful project for some of you known as a dissertation or a thesis, ah, and more probably the, the scientific method. But I also think, more importantly, it's been such a series of significant battles to even include just one of these collective identities, to talk openly about racism in our, in our lives. That, you know, I can certainly from, even from my own dissertation- (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
 (Coughing) 

00:25:25
MARIE L. MIVILLE - process, ah, of having a, a committee member question me about what do Latinos really self-identify? So, those kinds of experiences are very real and are very powerful. So, you know, when I talk about, I've, I just want to acknowledge the research and the, the advocacy that has gone on before me, as we begin to talk about the exploration of multiple aspects of identity because I think that builds on an entire body of pioneering work and pioneers that have gone before me. And I just see myself as an, a soldier with my own set of scars and war stories from these battles but I also say let's continue to march on. Okay. So, now, in addition to some qualitative, ah, research, ah, that I've de, I've developed, I've also been very interested in quantitative research. And as I tell my students, uhm, it's possible even essential to develop projects from that's more traditional, positivistic, ah, quantitative approach. But that it's important to take it with a critical consciousness and how, how on earth can you do that? And, you know, I was blessed with some, ah, really wonderful mentors, ah, one of whom is named after our mentoring ward here at TC. So, I feel I've been schooled very well on how we can do that. And, you know, it's by your choice of project, of instrument, uhm, you know, the research questions you're looking at, the way that you work with your communities and your participants. You know, it's not necessarily the method that determines how oppressive or recapitulating about oppression your project is. It's us. It's the researchers on how we approach our studies qualitative, quantitative. Okay, this fancy little diagram, my, my students know this one. And, it actually represents a recent set of studies that I undertook with my colleague, Dr. Angela Ferguson from Howard. She was here a little earlier but she went to go support her students to their presenting. And, ah, we looked at how one's sense of self, as a person of color and, and as a woman affected when we experience, uhm, sexism. And I'm not gonna go a whole lot into that. I just wanna give you an example of how we can develop research projects looking at these intersections and how they're meaningful and we wanted to see how your sense of self as a Latina, as an African-American affected how you would respond to sexism. And we found, in fact, that yes, if you look at the green, cultural identity, uhm, this was very important because for women of color, we conceptualize sexism as being nested in our social network, that is, what happened psychologically when important others to you react unsupportively when you are a target of sexism? How do- (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
 (Coughing) 

00:28:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE - these unsupportive reactions affect psychological distress such as anxiety, depression, somatic complaints? We thought that social interactions for women of color would be uniquely harmful or helpful in providing help for women when they have an experience with, ah, sexism. And, in fact, this fancy little diagram actually shows that, yes it does. Ah, so if you look at the, to the very left that USITA, and what that means is "Unsupportive Interactions Around Sexism," and then at the very other end, the yellow, that's socio, that's psychological distress. So that bottom arrow basically says, those two are related. Okay. But what is important to this research is that,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
 (Coughing) 

00:29:25
MARIE L. MIVILLE - that green circle, the cultural identity, your sense of self as a Latina, your sense of self as an African-American woman is the reason why there's that link between unsupportive social interactions and psychological distress. That's about as much I wanted to talk to you about that research but just to give you a sense or flavor of what research incorporating intersecting identities can look at. And to get it a little fancier, this is a mediation model and we found that, that box in blue which just means that if you perceive sexism and the circle in green which is cultural identity, fu, together fully explained, fully mediated, the relationship between unsupportive interactions and psychological distress. So, these are very powerful, uhm, variables in understanding this. And, as a matter of fact, I have this other really wonderful colleague who's also the fabulous director of this conference and as task consultant extraordinaire, Dr. Madonna Constantine who worked with me to develop this analysis and we were so excited about these findings, we really were. We were like dancing around my office. I was coming up with jewelry ideas, I don't know. And then,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
 (inaudible ) 

00:30:44
MARIE L. MIVILLE - it was regular day. It wasn't even 4:00 a.m. in the morning. Uhm, but, in fact, part of that was just our own celebration that we as women of color, we can do this. We've developed this research program and wherein, you know, we can get published in important journals and all that fancy stuff and hopefully help to contribute to the meaning, ah, of understanding how, what is our psychological function as people of color, as women and how does the impact of oppression and resilience affect us. Okay, the next slide, okay, this fancy little diagram, uhm, represents another area of interest that I have and this is, I just wanna, again, just share with you briefly. Ah, I have a lot of interest in training issues and this year,- (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
 (Coughing) 

00:31:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE - I chaired a special ta, task group with Division 17 and worked with a group of colleagues. And we developed what we call "an integrated training model," which actually incorporates a multidimensional approach that is who we are, ah, based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientations and so on and how we teach about multicultural counseling competence. In essence, we wanted to develop a model from the perspective that Olivia Aspen so brilliantly described about all of us some time ago. And that's simply, "diversity is the norm." Diversity is the norm. So, you know, we felt there was a really strong need for this, uhm, this work and, uhm, you know, it's quite(ph) pretty obvious who those of you at this roundtable that cultural competence is absolutely important and we actually believe it's a, what's called "cross-cutting." 

00:32:25
 (Coughing) 

00:32:25
MARIE L. MIVILLE That competence in culture is absolutely important to every single professional moment interaction that, that we have, ah, from the moment we say hello to a client and or hello to your participant, all the way to the, the time you say goodbye. So, if there is a goodbye. So, this is official depiction of how we might approach, ah, training from this inclusive or integrative model. The first step, ah, is to learn about your self as a multicultural person. What are your multiple identity and dimensions? What aspects about you are privileged? What aspects are oppressed? What norms, beliefs, expectations do you use? What is or are your social statuses? What dimension or dimensions are most important to you and why? What dimensions do you ignore and why? And only by developing a consciousness about your multicultural self, we feel that you can develop a truly authentic understanding of the diversity of your clients in front of you. 

00:33:30
 (Coughing) 

00:33:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE So, in other words, from day one I really believe that students need to begin to learn and professionals (laughs), ah, to learn in various important ways that we differ, ah, and that how to incorporate that and how we think about clients, do research and all that. So, as Audre, Cherrie and Gloria and many others who taught us, expanding our definitions and models of diversity beyond single dimensions will strengthen their importance and relevance within ourselves. They add to our sense of wholeness and they provide the basis of developing authentic relationships between each other and among communities. Thank you.
