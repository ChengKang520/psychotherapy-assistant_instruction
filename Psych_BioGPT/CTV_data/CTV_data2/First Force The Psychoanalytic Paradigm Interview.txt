MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Hi. My name is Dr. Manivong J. Ratts, and I am associate professor in the department of counseling and (ph)sool, school psychology at Seattle University. Today, what you're going to be doing is watching a video series titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. We're going to be over the major theoretical paradigms, if you will, or forces that have really shaped, uh, how counseling is practiced with clients. We're gonna look at: the first force, which is the psychoanalytic tradition; the second force, which is also referred to as the cognitive behavioral tradition in counseling and psychotherapy; then we'll highlight and provide an overview of the third force in human counseling which is the existential, humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology; then, we'll look at the fourth force in counseling, which is referred to as the multicultural paradigm in the field; and then, last but not least, we'll examine and look at social justice as the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. Within each of these particular theories or paradigms or forces, if you will, I'll be interviewing experts in the field. Each of these experts will be sharing and talking about their current research within that particular paradigm, as well as some major tenets about the particular force that, uh, they are specializing in in a particular field, so I'll be interviewing uh, a psychoanalytic, uh, uh, scholar; I'll be interviewing a CBT scholar, existential scholar, a multicultural-oriented scholar, and then, last but not least, a social justice-oriented scholar who's really help shaped each of those particular forces and made them what they are today. Following each of those particular interviews, uh, what you'll see is a series of therapy sessions with the same client. The client will be working with five different therapists. Each therapist will be operating from a particular tradition, paradigm, or force, if you will. The first therapist will be operating from a psychoanalytic tradition; the second therapist will be working from a CBT perspective, cognitive behavioral, uh, orientation; uh, the third therapist will be operating from a existential, humanistic perspective in counseling; the fourth therapist will be working from a multicultural oriented perspective; and then, last but not least, we have a demonstration of a therapist working from a social justice- oriented perspective. My hope is that, by watching each of these particular videos, uh, or interviews, if you will, as well as each of these particular counseling sessions, it'll really highlight and provide you with some of the strengths and weaknesses of each particular, uh, counseling force that have really shaped how counseling is practiced to this day. Today, what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. What you'll be watching is me interviewing scholars in the psychoanalytic tradition from the Psychoanalytic Society Ins-, Institute. I'll be interviewing doctors Ken King, Robert Janes, and Susan Radant, who are all experts in the field of psychoanalysis, and they'll be sharing some of the major tenets of that particular theory, some of the historical perspectives of the psychoanalytic tradition, some of the current research that's, um, happening right now that is having a significant impact on the psychoanalytic tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. Following that interview, you'll be watching a live counseling session with a client. The therapist is Dr. Sheri Hunt, who is also from the Seattle Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and she'll be demonstrating how to operationalize psychoanalys-, er, psy-, the psychoanalytic tradition with this particular client. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy, where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling as we know it today, the psychoanalytic tradition, which is the first force in counseling, the second force is referred to as the cognitive behavioral tradition, the third being the existential/humanistics tradition, the fourth, the multicultural counseling paradigm and, last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

00:04:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Hi. My name is Dr. Vong Ratts, from Seattle University, and I'm here today with Dr. Ken King, Sue Radant, and Rob Janes, and, today, what we're gonna do is talk about the psychoanalytic tradition, the first force in the field of counseling and psychotherapy. I wanna begin this interview by talking and asking, uh, all of you a little bit about what is the psychoanalytic paradigm in counseling and psychotherapy, if you can sort of give me a little idea of what that entails a little bit? 

00:05:20
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Well, psychoanalysis today is a polytheoretical model; it's not any one particular model, and that's, that's why it's so rich, um, but underlying all theoretical models in psychoanalysis are some fundamental principles, and one is the understanding that there are unconscious dynamic processes that are influencing all of us in our lives, and uh, the other (ph)us, uh, one is that one's subjective life is worthy of study and understanding, because psychoanalysis, unlike all the other disciplines, focuses not exclusively but predominantly on one's internal life - that's dreams, fantasies, associations; anything that's the content of your mind, so that's what it's about. There's one other underlying principle, which is called (ph)psychic determinism. It sounds a little fancy. It's a uh, it's a subspecies of philosophical determinism and it's very simple. What it means is if somebody says, "A, B, C, and D," they tend to think that they might be connected. It underlies the principle of free association, which many people may have heard about in terms of psychoanalysis. 

00:06:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Mm-kay, okay. Hm. How did this theory sort of evolve over time? 

00:06:35
KEN KING, M.D. I'll take a shot at that. Uh, um, I think different people have different versions about how it uh, evolved over time, depending upon one's own preferred sub-theory within psychoanalysis, so-to-speak, but uh, certainly, everyone knows of Sigmund Freud and his initial pioneering and development of psychoanalytic principles, including a great deal of what Rob just said, um, but, said in his way back in those early days . . . I think he actually first used the word psychoanalysis - what - in 18 . . . 

00:07:10
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. '98 or (crosstalk)'99. 

00:07:10
KEN KING, M.D. (crosstalk) . . . '98 or '96 or something like that, going way back, at any rate, but um, uh, he started with hypnosis; uh, these were the pre-analytic days, but then, he became convinced of the power of the unconscious mind and unconscious processes and, of course, of doing that, uh, and then this led to his pursuing what later became psychoanalysis. Instead of this direct approach of hypnosis, rather letting the patient come up more directly and spontaneously with his or her talking, thoughts, feelings, etcetera. Then, over the years, this evolved with him and he developed a cadre of fellow, uh, thinkers, so-to-speak, and practitioners and the field enrichened as time went by, uh, and then since there's been many developments. His daughter, Anna Freud, uh, became one of the very early child and adolescent psychoanalysts, so that was a whole other aspect of um, psychoanalysis developed. There were the Kleinians, Melanie Klein and her followers in Great Britain. Um, here in America, uh . . . Well, I should also say, in Great Britain, the middle school, Winnicott, Balint . . . You know, people along those lines, and then, here in the United States, uh, there are American um, so-called ego psychologists that were more or less in direct connection with the Europeans, uh, who, some of whom moved to the United States around the time of World War II. Um, um, ego psychology are nowadays what's called structural theory. It has to do with the idea of a (ph)tri-part (ph)type model of the mind, the ego, super-ego, and id. I think, by now, these are fairly familiar concepts. There's been a lot of changes to this over time, but it's still something that's there. Um, object relations theory began with uh, um, people, uh, uh, exploring, uh, childrens' early mental life. This includes Melanie Klein and her followers, but there's a type of object relations that developed with Anna Freud and her followers, especially Joseph Sandler as well. This also took hold in the United States, uh, a relatively more modern day example of this is Margaret Mahler and Otto Kernberg, here in the United States. Uh, we have many other sub-fields, so-to-speak, of psychoanalysis that have developed: uh, self psychology; um, relational, um, intersubjective, interpersonal . . . I could go on and on, but . . . 

00:10:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Sounds like it really evolved from Freud, (crosstalk)and, and, and since then there's been a lot of variations (crosstalk)of psychoanalytic theory, or the paradigm. 

00:10:10
KEN KING, M.D. (crosstalk)(ph)Richard. (crosstalk)Right. Right. 

00:10:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Uh, (crosstalk)yeah. 

00:10:15
ROBERT JANES, M.D. (crosstalk)That's exactly right. Alfred North Whitehead, the philosopher, once said that all philosophy is footnotes to Plato, all psychoanalysis is footnotes to Freud. 

00:10:20
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. That's true. 

00:10:20
ROBERT JANES, M.D. An elaboration of his ideas. 

00:10:25
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Right. I think the differences between some of the schools is just where their predominant focus is, right? Like, for example, the interpersonal school that was, um, started by Harry Stack Sullivan and his associates has uh, more of a focus on the actual external, interpersonal dynamic between people, but the relational school, which is a more contemporary model of psychoanalysis combines that with object relations theory, so there's a look both at what's going on in the person's internal, subjective representational world, uh, in addition to what's going on specifically in their external world, and uh, one of the places where that's uh, given great consideration in all uh, theories of psychoanalysis is in the transference, which is the relationship that's established between uh, the patient and the uh, the analyst or therapist, uh, which is gonna contain all sorts of both subjective and also objective aspects of the relationship. 

00:11:35
KEN KING, M.D. That last point about the transference, I (crosstalk)think, is a technical aspect of the psychoanalytic process, the development of transference and its expiration and interpretation and etcetera that, I think, predominantly unites most of the different schools of psychoanalysis. That's a relatively uniting concept. Again, there are some differences about that, but that is a very major concept. 

00:12:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:12:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. For viewers who may not know what (ph)transferism, I wonder if you can sort of elaborate on that a little bit. 

00:12:10
KEN KING, M.D. Go ahead; you started. 

00:12:15
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Okay. I started . . . Well, um, the transference, um, uh, can be described, again, in many different ways, depending on the theoretical perspective within psychoanalysis, but, generally speaking, it is the relationship between the analyst and the patient which, um, consists, usually, of a number of levels and components. Uh, it can be the patient's subjective understanding or sense of the analyst; uh, it can be objective um, sorts of parts of the relationship that are there; um, it can be fantasy that the patient may have about the analyst; uh, it can also uh, take on developmental functions as well, uh, like, for example, in self psychology, the transference is often called self object transference, and what this is is that the patient will establish a kind of relationship with the analyst which is developmentally (ph)repairative and will try to um, fix, basically, problems that have happened, um, usually starting very early in their lives, but often continuing through the lifespan. Um, specifically, when I self object transference, uh, they may uh, try to take on, uh, with the analyst, certain types of aspects of the early, infant- parent relationship, like the need to be mirrored, the need to be understood, uh, the need to have um, uh, their sense of self organized, or maybe the need to idealize the parent, because the parent, you know, early in life and, hopefully, too, without, throughout the lifespan, also remains a figure that the child or the adult child can look up to, so they may uh, try to relate in that sort of way, or even (ph)adversarially, too, which is an important piece too, because, (ph)you (ph)know, part of human development is the need to separate an (ph)individuate, going back to what you had mentioning about Margaret Mahler, which was, uh, a big part of her theoretical contribution to psychoanalysis, so they may take on an adversarial, um, relationship with the therapist, but this is all sort of under the rubric of the transference. 

00:14:50
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Um, I would add a couple things to that. Um, you always have to keep in mind that, for all of us, the past is still alive in us, and so, in psychoanalysis, the past comes alive in the present, in the process of the transference, and that's what needs to be dealt with and interpreted, and there are many ways in which it comes alive, depending on the nature of the psychopathology you're dealing with, but it's keeping alive . . . The, the path is always alive, and that's what makes psychoanalysis not simply an archaeological dig to figure out what happened back then. It comes alive in the present, in the room. 

00:15:25
KEN KING, M.D. The feelings, the patterns of relating, um, conflicts . . . Uh, all of that comes alive, and that's part of what is so exciting as an analyst and, to some extent, as a patient when that happens, but it's also part of what the psychoanalytic, uh, technique and uh, the technical precepts like (ph)frequentsations, etcetera, is all set up to facilitate that kind of occurrence, so that can be revisited in a very alive kind of way. 

00:15:55
ROBERT JANES, M.D. And transference, as far as I know, in psychoanalysis, is the only place where transference is really thoroughly dealt with. There's no other theoretical therapeutic paradigm that focuses so much on this element. 

00:16:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Are there, are there key concepts that sort of bind or tie in all the different psychoanalytic theories? You mentioned psych-, uh, transference being one. 

00:16:20
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Interpretation, uh, would be another key concept, um, and you know, that is through the process of free association, which is listening to what it is. Uh, the patient brings up . . . Uh, they're asked . . . Well, actually, let me backtrack for a moment. Free association is one of those factors, too, which is uh, part of the uh, psychoanalytic methodology, and, basically, what that means is, uh, when the patient comes in, they're instructed to, as best that they can - cuz this is a lot harder, in reality, to do than it sounds, is - to speak about exactly what just comes to their mind, you know, even if there's nothing that comes to their mind, you know, they might speak about that, but the uh, role of the analyst is to take, um, the patient's free associations, um, through the process also of empathy or vicarious introspection, you know, which is, um, trying to put yourself basically into the mind of the patient and try to understand what his or her internal world is about, and also your pieces of history, pieces of intuition, uh, to put together interpretations, which are pieces of understanding about the patient's internal world, and it may be based on what's going on right in the moment, which actually tends to be some more powerful forms of interpretation, when you can speak to what's going on in the here and now. Um, they may also may be genetic, and, what's meant by genetic in psychoanalytic jargon is basically the historical, um, about their relationships with their early caregivers and um, other people of importance. Um, it may be based on affect; you know, what they're feeling but maybe not knowing that they're feeling and many other things that I think you can add, but it's a piece of understanding that is formed together by this collaboration between the patient and the analyst. 

00:18:40
ROBERT JANES, M.D. You guys are really good; I'm learning something! 

00:18:45
KEN KING, M.D. I want uh, a couple of things that uh, Sue, uh, alluded to here, but I wanna highlight a bit. I think, when we talk about free associations, uh, ideally, it isn't just the mental experiences that the ch-, the patient's having, but uh, it may be physical experiences too. Uh, say the patient, uh, has some different physical sensation or physiologic process or whatever during the hour, but they're not normally that way. Well, that means something, right? Uh, suddenly, they develop a headache after talking about a certain topic, for example, uh, whatever it may be. Uh, and then another part that I will often say if I'm talking about the concept of free assa-, association, I (ph)don't use those words, free association, with the patient, but "just please say whatever comes to your mind," and that's more difficult than one might think and, typically, what we need to pay attention to is also what makes it difficult, so that, ideally, the patient is also looking at that. Well, they stop or they pause or you see them getting flustered or whatever the case may be that, that tells me, as an analyst, that, at that moment, my client, my patient is having some kind of difficult in really having a sense of internal freedom to speak his or her mind, something's interfering with their freedom. 

00:20:10
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Um, I, I have a, uh, uh, anecdote. I, I had this patient analysis some years ago and he was laying on the couch, and I was behind him, and obviously I said something to him that he didn't like, right? And he started complaining about pain in his finger and he says, "I'm having this pain in my finger. It's kind of this (ph)ptosis of my finger," and he's pointing this back, and completely innocently. I mean, he didn't, wasn't consciously giving me the finger, but, basically, that's what he was saying, so, just to kind of elaborate, right, on these kind of psycho-physiological sorts of things that can come up as a process of free association. 

00:20:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. So it sounds like the analyst uses a lot of what's happening in the room, (crosstalk)with the patient . . . 

00:20:55
INTERVIEWEES (crosstalk)Absolutely. 

00:21:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . and in the moment and in the here and now to interpret their experience of what's (crosstalk)happening. 

00:21:05
ROBERT JANES, M.D. (crosstalk)It makes it alive. Every good analysis isn't an explanation. It's an experience. That's an important distinction, and it's an experience in the here and now. Even though it's connected to the then and there, it's in the here and now. 

00:21:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Is that what makes it difficult for patients, sometimes? 

00:21:20
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Initially. 

00:21:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:21:20
KEN KING, M.D. (crosstalk)It, it sometimes makes it difficult for the analyst, too. 

00:21:20
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Oh, yes. 

00:21:20
KEN KING, M.D. Uh, you know, imagine you're in the room and the patient is really truly seeing you as, say, an abusive father, or a neglectful mother. Uh, that can be very intense, and that's the flip side of what we're talking about here with transference, too, is called counter-transference, where we need to pay attention to our own feeling states that get stirred up with the patient. Uh, that's one reason why, as part of psychoanalytic training, people need to undergo their own, what's called, training analysis - it's a personal analysis, but where each analyst, ideally, has gotten well-informed about his or her vulnerabilities, conflicts, old patterns, um, history, etcetera, so that, when these things do get stirred up with a patient, it's not brand new. Hopefully, they have some idea about what this means about him or herself, and also some idea about what it is this interaction with this patient that's leading to this getting stirred up, okay? Uh, there are different ways of looking at counter-transference, but, nowadays, I think most analysts take a relatively broad definition of it that it includes both one's own stuff, so-to-speak, that gets stirred up, but it also includes what it is about uh, the patient that is stirring up. In other words, it's looked as a interaction between uh, the behavior and the emotions and the psychological state of the patient and that of the analyst, so the effort is made to not just pay attention to content about what the patient is saying or even feelings the patient has, but also what is getting stirred up within the analyst and why now, why this, etcetera. 

00:23:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. You mentioned training. What type of training is involved, and how long is that training? 

00:23:25
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. A long time. No. Uh, to be a psychoanalyst, um, you first need to have, um, your degree and profession in a particular field, uh, like both Ken and Rob are psychiatrists, so they have finished their uh, psychiatric training. I'm a clinical psychologist, so I've finished my training, my Ph.D. there and we also have people that are master's level therapists as well, like (ph)MSW's, uh, licensed mental health counselors, and other people with master's degree, but who are operating as professionals in the field of psychotherapy, and um, the psychoanalytic training is at least four more years after that, but that's usually pretty quick for somebody to get through their analytic training, um, so at, at the Seattle Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, we have, basically, uh, four years of classroom work. In addition to that, um, the candidate for, for being an analyst, needs to be in their own personal training psychoanalysis, like Rob and Ken mentioned, and also be supervised in doing psychoanalysis with at least three individuals, so um, that all needs to be completed before graduation. 

00:24:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. So it's pretty intensive training . . . 

00:24:55
KEN KING, M.D. Right. 

00:25:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . after graduate work . . . 

00:25:00
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Right. 

00:25:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . pretty much. 

00:25:00
KEN KING, M.D. Right. 

00:25:00
ROBERT JANES, M.D. But it keeps you . . . Time flies when you're having fun. It's, it's so interesting. That's, that's why you do it. Nobody does, uh, becomes a psychoanalyst for fame or money. They do it because it's interesting. (crosstalk)It's a very interesting way to . . . 

00:25:15
KEN KING, M.D. (crosstalk)Right, right. 

00:25:15
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Right. 

00:25:15
ROBERT JANES, M.D. . . . to . . . 

00:25:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. And that brings the question, for me, what got you involved in this particular . . . 

00:25:20
ROBERT JANES, M.D. I can answer (crosstalk)that (inaudible ) . . . 

00:25:24
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk) . . . theoretical force? 

00:25:25
ROBERT JANES, M.D. I was in my residency at Stanford, and my supervisors were all psychoanalysts; I had some who weren't psychoanalysts. The only ones that made any sense to me about what the patients were saying were the analysts. That was, uh, a no-brainer. When I got done I said, "I wanna be an analyst." It's usually that way. There's a powerful professional influence of some kind. 

00:25:40
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Yeah, uh, uh, for me, before I went back to school and uh, in clinical psychology, I had a former career, which is as a registered nurse, and uh, during my nursing school, which was in the early 1970's, uh, which was in Chicago, um, the pre-dominant theory that both we were taught during our psychiatry rotation and also uh, in the clinic in the hospital we worked in was psychoanalytic, so that's what got me really interested to begin with, because it's just fascinating, you know, to uh, recognize that people could feel or behave or, uh, have symptoms related to something that they didn't understand that was unconscious, so when I finished that and I went back to school, uh, my focus was on trying to become an analyst and some undergraduate electives were all in psychoanalytic theory. Uh, the graduate school that I went to was psychoanalytically oriented and then, uh, finishing uh, you know, and then, after a few years I was able to go to (ph)Sipsey for training, but that'd been a goal for a very long time. 

00:26:55
KEN KING, M.D. I would echo what Sue and Rob are saying. Uh, for me, it started in college where I, I took a course where it involved reading Freud, and Freud really spoke to me and helped me make sense of a troubling relationship I was having with my girlfriend at the time. 

00:27:15
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Help with lots of those, yeah. 

00:27:15
ROBERT JANES, M.D. I hope she's not watching. 

00:27:20
KEN KING, M.D. She went into another field. 

00:27:20
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Oh, okay. 

00:27:25
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. No chance then? That's good. 

00:27:25
KEN KING, M.D. But at any rate . . . And I also got very interested in child development then and that naturally led to interest in the mind and the development of the mind and so forth. Uh, by the way, in spea- . . . I made this joking reference to understanding better a relationship with a girlfriend, but, I think, really, it's probably very common for people that go into becoming any kind of therapist, uh, that there's probably something there that is part of the reason why in our past history that we're working out. We're uh . . . Maybe we had a depressed mother we wanted to help or we wanted help or, you know, whatever it may be (crosstalk)that, uh, is a personal reason that's probably contributing too, and it'd be different from one person to another, but, for me, at any rate, part of what kept my uh, interest in analysis alive was a similar kind experiences during uh, residency training but also once in psychoanalytic training. I just love that kind of incredible intimacy and closeness, uh, that is there in an analytic relationship. Uh, I think we approximate something like that doing once-a-week work, supportive work, uh, more cognitive behavioral work, whatever it may be, uh, that we do as well as analysis, but there's something about the intensity, the frequency of appointments, that growing openness that develops between analyst and analysand, etcetera, that is just very, very special, that just usually is not there in other forms of treatment that, at least, I've done in my life. I worked in community mental health centers and done a lot of short-term work and so forth, but this has just been the most gratifying work to do, as well as the most challenging, in terms of making me stretch, so-to-speak, both conceptually and intellectually, but also just personally. 

00:29:25
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. 

00:29:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. You talked earlier a lot about the benefits of psychoanalytic theory for patients. What do you see as you look at this theory? What do you see as its limitations? Does that make sense? 

00:29:40
ROBERT JANES, M.D. It's a, it's a perfectly legitimate question. I think . . . 

00:29:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Or maybe not so much what you see, but what do other people see as this is a limitations about this particular theoretical paradigm in the field? 

00:29:50
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Well, I could say a little bit about that, and my colleagues may have other ideas. Um, I, I think its, its limitations are, has to be qualified by the context. Psychoanalytic theory and practice - keep in mind that the theory is different than uh, the practice - are applicable to a wide range of mental health interventions. There's psychoanalytic couples therapy; there's psychoanalytic group therapy; even people that have psychotic processes, although they may require medical inventions and so on, can benefit from having someone who can listen and try to understand, so I think the limitations are, uh . . . It's hard to think about the limitations because you'd have to adapt the technique to any given clinical situation, so it's often very useful. 

00:30:40
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. You know, I, I think uh, some of the limitations, uh, that others have said about it are mainly based on misperceptions about psychoanalysis. You know, a lot of people tend to kind of retain, uh, sort of more archaic viewpoint about (crosstalk)what analysis is. I mean, they think it's all what Freud did, basically, and that all you're doing is exploring early childhood and not paying attention to what's going on in the person's contemporary life . . . 

00:31:10
ROBERT JANES, M.D. (crosstalk)Uh-huh, for sure. 

00:31:10
KEN KING, M.D. Or that all you're interested in is sex, (crosstalk)you know? 

00:31:10
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, exactly. 

00:31:10
KEN KING, M.D. The sexual life of the patient. 

00:31:15
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Or aggression or (crosstalk)something like that. 

00:31:15
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. (crosstalk)Right, right, yeah. 

00:31:15
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Yeah. 

00:31:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:31:20
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. So, I mean, I, I . . . You know, I can't think of limitations. I can just think of more applications, actually. 

00:31:25
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Apr-, apropo of the uh, criticisms of psychoanalysis, I'm always struck that the criticisms seem to be criticizing ancient texts, as if you were studying Old English instead of contemporary English, because there's been such an evolution in the field over the last - at this point - 110 years. 

00:31:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. So, more so misconceptions about what the theory is or where that theory is at now . . . 

00:31:50
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Right. 

00:31:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . more than anything, sounds like what you're all saying. 

00:31:50
KEN KING, M.D. There are criticisms about it as therapy, too, uh, and this is common. It's very difficult to do, you know, double-blind, controlled studies, etcetera, prospective, for psychoanalysis. I mean, where are you gonna get uh, a whole bunch of patients that are willing to subject themselves to that and then control patients and so forth, so it's hard to do that kind of study. Um, I can say that studies that have been done with videotape evidence and so forth is that, um, um, there are certain similarities as therapists get more experienced. For example, say cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoanalysis. The experienced psychoanalyst may do a little bit more advice giving or uh, looking for triggers and things like that than he might uh, realize, uh, he does, because it used to be frowned upon, at any rate, within psychoanalysis, to do these kinds of things, and the cognitive behavioral therapist who's really experienced might do more transference-based work but not realize that's what he or she is doing, uh, and, and more empathic sort of comments to the patient and so forth, so I think part of this, I think, comes with the growing edge of being a therapist. You know, uh, an experienced analyst is gonna be different from one who's just starting, but also probably is gonna be more flexible a lot of the time instead of feeling constrained, (crosstalk)you know? 

00:33:30
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. 

00:33:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. If a patient were to work with an analyst, what's the typical number of sessions, years . . . How long is it? Does that make sense? 

00:33:40
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Yes, it does. Um, uh, for . . . On a weekly basis, it, it depends a little bit - this is a kind of a politicized issue right now. Uh, the traditional way of doing it, psychoanalysis, has been four or five days a week, uh, some people, though, are also advocating for three times as week as being enough and I think that can be. It depends on the person, the patient you're working with. Um, the length of time? That's a hard one to say. Um, they're usually pretty lengthy. Um, I, I think uh, an analysis, uh, that has come to a successful completion, I think the uh, shortest amount of time that I've seen anybody maybe has been about three years, but, often, it can be a lot longer than that. 

00:34:35
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Also, keep in mind that psychoanalysts don't just do analysis. We work with a wide variety of patients with a wide variety of psychopathology using a wide variety of interventions, all informed by our psychoanalytic experience, but uh, in, in the end, some people come in twice a week and once a week and profit enormously from a psychoanalytic technique, so it's not just restricted to formal psychoanalysis. 

00:35:00
KEN KING, M.D. For that matter, when I used to do a lot more inpatient work, say, with acutely psychotic, uh, people, uh, I found my psychoanalytic background very useful in talking to them and understanding more quickly what the meaning of the psychotic symptoms might be. I still prescribed medication and so forth and so on, helped them, you know, recover as quickly as possible from a psychotic break, but my analytic background was enormously helpful for me in terms of reaching them, you know, and having, and building up trust in, say, a paranoid patient. Um, but, to get more specific to your question about how long it might take, I'd also like to add, uh, working analytically with children or adolescents, it, often times, is quicker, especially if I have a very young child in child analysis. They're not as fixed yet, in terms of personality structure, you know? More is in flux, and so it's even conceivable that someone who's a very young child, say, five or six or something, might really have a complete analysis, uh, as far as child analysis goes, in two years. Uh, that's still pretty short. Uh, usually, it is gonna be longer; that's not unheard of. But it'd be very unusual if it's gonna be two years, say, with an adult. 

00:36:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Multiculturalism has grown in the field. How has this particular paradigm taken into consideration changes of multiculturalism and diversity? 

00:36:25
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. I think that's always something that we stay conscious of when we're working with people, you know, is about their racial, ethnic, cultural, religious background, so I, I think both the theory and the, the psychoanalytic technique flexes along with that. Um, I mean, actually, in one way, I think it's a real advantage because, um, your, the idea - right - in doing psychoanalytic treatment is to understand the subjective world of the person that you're working with, which, of course, is gonna be influenced by, you know, a variety of cultural, religious, etcetera, kinds of experiences, so I, I think it gets incorporated well within the theory. 

00:37:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. As you consider some of the research now, with respect to psychoanalytic theory, where do you see it going in the future? 

00:37:25
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Well, I, I was gonna say, strongly, as a matter of fact, at our own institute, we've had a pretty large influx of new candidates that are interested in learning psychoanalysis and becoming, uh, psychoanalysts, so, I think, in the profession, it's moving forward, although I do know, in other parts of the country, that this isn't the case. I think Seattle, maybe, is unique in some ways, you know, maybe by virtue of the presence that we've created for ourselves in the greater Seattle community, you know, which has been through other means, not just the psychotherapy and the psychoanalysis, but in applied (ph)secla-, uh, applied psychoanalysis, like, for example, at our institute we offer programs in music and in visual art, uh, incorporating psychoanalytic ideas and traditions with that, uh, so, um, I think there is a wide application for it in a lot of areas we haven't tapped just because we don't have, uh, the man power, the woman power to do that, like literature, history, philosophy, and that, but that, that's my opinion. 

00:38:45
KEN KING, M.D. More specifically, on the issue of research, um, there's different kinds of research, you know? There's research, say, taking up some technical consideration within psychoanalysis as a practice and then exploring that and I, I mentioned earlier some videotape research, etcetera, about that kind of thing, but um, there's also research about efficacy, effectiveness and so forth, but, typically, that's done with um, in a somewhat more limited way, because of the need to have a more uniform population of subjects and so forth, so, uh, (ph)for (ph)me . . . And so it's often what, what might be called somewhat applied psychoanalysis. For example, there's been research in the last few years that's published about the efficacy about psychoanalytically-oriented, uh, treatment for panic disorders, you know, where it was quite efficacious, uh, but it was shorter term work, you know; it wasn't like full-blown psychoanalysis. Similarly, there's work in New York and in London on working with borderline personality disorders, uh, with, again, very good results, um, but it's not just plain psychoanalysis. It's uh . . . You know, the program in London is also a day treatment program; uh, the, the program in New York . . . It's Otto Kernberg's unit, uh, um, it's, it's an applied psychoanalysis; it's usually a twice-per-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy and heavily focused on the transference in a moment to moment kind of way, but, again, showing very good results that hold up over time, so there are these kinds of research efforts going on, but I think it's gonna be very difficult to have that sort of, kind of quantitative research about, uh, uh, you know, "Does it work? How well does it work?" etcetera, uh, done, just because of the same reasons I mentioned earlier. There may be qualitative research, in terms of, um, different aspects of uh, what might uh, work best with a given, given population or whatever, but that's . . . And then there can be research that's interdisciplinary. Uh, a lot of the research, I think, that's psychoanalytically informed right now is about child development and infant development and parent-infant interaction and so forth. It's been very rich. Um, uh, there's the work of people like Daniel Stern, uh, uh, Lou Sander in Boston; uh, uh, I can number, mention any number of people, people that are really doing work with uh, early intervention and situations of disorganized attachment or maybe abuse, whatever, who are analysts that are analytically informed, uh, that have made major contributions over the last 20, even 30, years. Uh, I mean, everybody, I think, knows Daniel Stern, at this point, is very psychoanalytically informed, but he brings, you know, other disciplines into his work as well. Uh, I think this kind of research has also had a big impact on psychoanalytic therapy and also psychoanalytic process, to some extent. Uh, I'll bring up one example here. One of the concepts originally in psychoanalysis, going way back to Freud again was that of repression, so the idea that um, we have thoughts, feelings, urges, whatever, that are repressed, and Freud's original idea was that these were unacceptable, say, to our so-called super-ego, that part of us that makes a judgment about the goodness or badness or acceptability of some urge or thought or feeling that we're having. Nowadays, that still holds, but it's, it's also clear, especially if we're talking about patterns of relating. Some of that isn't repressed, per-se, but it was never quite conscious in the first place. 

00:42:55
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Right. There's a distinction between what's conscious, what's non-conscious, (crosstalk)and what's unconscious. 

00:43:00
KEN KING, M.D. (crosstalk)Right, right. 

00:43:05
KEN KING, M.D. So this, this goes to something else that I thought we should cycle back to, too, because you were mentioning object relations and self object and . . . Uh, I think, when I started analytic training, that word object and object relations kind of set me off. I didn't quite like it because, really, when we're talking about objects, we're talking about people, okay, but here's this word that seems so . . . 

00:43:25
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Yeah. 

00:43:25
KEN KING, M.D. . . . deanimated and uh, unpersonal. Uh, it goes all the way back to Freud, an idea of, uh, say, the mother is the object of the child's drives, okay, and some of this theory people don't use the same way or think of the same way, but the words have held on, okay, so there's this word, object, that's part of psychoanalytic theory, then . . . 

00:43:50
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Right. 

00:43:50
KEN KING, M.D. . . . but, really, what is meant by an object is someone in a person's life, and then, in terms of object relations, we mean uh, intrapsychically, uh, the relationship in the mind that that person has, so the self with the object, so that would be object relations. I'm really simplifying this, but uh, that's the gist of it, I think. Rob, you want to say something, it looks like. 

00:44:25
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Well, I, I think, I think the uh, principle point to be made is that it's a living process . . . 

00:44:30
KEN KING, M.D. Right. 

00:44:30
ROBERT JANES, M.D. . . . and if you really want to learn about what psychoanalysis is about, call up your local psychoanalytic psychotherapist or analyst and get the experience, because the theory is sort of abstract and kind of arid, on the one hand, but if it's paired with the actual experience, it all comes alive, so you have to do it sort of together, so I understand why people are turned off by, say, object relations theory because, "What is this about? Human beings?", you know, but the experience of having a therapy of a psychoanalytic kind will bring to life all these other conceptual things, and, of course, when we talk to our patients, we don't use these terms. We use everyday, ordinary language. 

00:45:10
KEN KING, M.D. Right. 

00:45:10
ROBERT JANES, M.D. The language we've been using here today you will never hear in an analyst's office. You don't talk about objects and super-egos. It doesn't happen, you know? We might talk about the part of yourself that seems to be persecuting you. That seems to be closer to the mark, that kind of thing. 

00:45:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. So the theory and practice are really two different things. 

00:45:25
ROBERT JANES, M.D. (crosstalk)Abs-, abs-, absolutely. 

00:45:25
KEN KING, M.D. (crosstalk)Right, absolutely. 

00:45:30
ROBERT JANES, M.D. They're related, but uh, in a (crosstalk)certain way . . . 

00:45:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Theory informs practice. 

00:45:30
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Right, right, but it's, it's different. 

00:45:35
KEN KING, M.D. Practice, I think, is usually going to be in trouble if it is too beholding and limited by theory. 

00:45:40
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. (crosstalk)Right. 

00:45:40
ROBERT JANES, M.D. (crosstalk)Oh, (crosstalk)absolutely. 

00:45:40
KEN KING, M.D. You know? 

00:45:40
ROBERT JANES, M.D. In fact, how you, what theory comes from, it comes from practice. It's what is the instigator of practice, you know? You have Kohut's work, for example, as a result of his experience with patients who had certain kinds of psychic deficits, and he came up with an additional psychoanalytic paradigm which has been invaluable, but it didn't come from thinking about things. It came from the experience with the patient. 

00:46:05
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Right. 

00:46:05
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Yeah. 

00:46:10
KEN KING, M.D. And I think that's really where almost all the advances in psychoanalysis have come from, from someone struggling to capture, in words, "Well, what is it that's happening here? Why is this different?" 

00:46:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Dr. King, Dr. Radant, Dr. Janes, I wanna thank you for this time to, uh, share a little bit about psychoanalytic theory. 

00:46:35
SUSAN RADANT, PH.D. Thank you. 

00:46:35
KEN KING, M.D. Thank you. 

00:46:35
ROBERT JANES, M.D. Yeah, you're welcome. 

00:46:35
KEN KING, M.D. It's a pleasure.

5 "Forces" of Counseling and Psychotherapy An Overview by Manivong J. Ratts, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Seattle University 

00:46:40
Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:46:40
Ken King, M.D. Robert Janes, M.D. Susan Radant, Ph.D. Seattle Psychoanalytic Society and Institute 

00:46:40
Sheri Hunt, M.D. Seattle Psychoanalytic Society and Institute 

00:46:40
Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:47:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Today, what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy. What you'll be watching is me interviewing scholars in the psychoanalytic tradition from the Psychoanalytic Society Ins-, Institute. I'll be interviewing doctors Ken King, Robert Janes, and Susan Radant, who are all experts in the field of psychoanalysis, and they'll be sharing some of the major tenets of that particular theory, some of the historical perspectives of the psychoanalytic tradition, some of the current research that's, um, happening right now that is having a significant impact on the psychoanalytic tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. Following that interview, you'll be watching a live counseling session with a client. The therapist is Dr. Sheri Hunt, who is also from the Seattle Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and she'll be demonstrating how to operationalize psychoanalys-, er, psy-, the psychoanalytic tradition with this particular client. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy, where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling as we know it today: the psychoanalytic tradition, which is the first force in counseling, the second force is referred to as the cognitive behavioral tradition, the third being the existential/humanistics tradition, the fourth, the multicultural counseling paradigm and, last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:49:10
1st Force: The Psychoanalytic Approach to Psychotherapy Sheri Hunt, M.D. Seattle Psychoanalytic Society and Institute 

00:49:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Hi. I'm Dr. Hunt. How are you? 

00:49:15
ANNIE I'm good. How are you? 

00:49:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Um, you're Annie? (crosstalk)Annie (ph)Jo? Can you tell me what brings you here today? 

00:49:20
ANNIE (crosstalk)Yes, yes. Um, well, I sort of didn't want to come, actually. My friend (ph)Lauren dragged me out to see someone, um, and she recommended you, so that's why I'm here, I guess. 

00:49:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So a friend encouraged you to come? 

00:49:45
ANNIE Right. 

00:49:45
SHERI HUNT, M.D. What do you, what do you think I can help you with? What do you think you might be struggling with? So your friend suggested seeing me? 

00:49:55
ANNIE Well, I have been (ph)also, I haven't been going to class for the last three or four weeks, um, so my friend was worried about me, um, and I haven't contact her either in three or four weeks, so she was worried, and you know, she called a couple times and, you know, she came to my house a couple of times and, finally, to, you know, just get her off my back, I, I came, um, so she's, she's worried about me because I haven't been going to class. 

00:50:25
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Have you been spending most of your time alone in your house? 

00:50:30
ANNIE Yeah. Uh, my husband . . . He works, so . . . Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Who else is at home with you? Who else is in the home? 

00:50:40
ANNIE It's just me and him. 

00:50:45
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Just you and your husband? And you're normally going to class? What are you studying? 

00:50:45
ANNIE Um, right now, I'm just, um, in my first, uh, year and a half-ish, so I don't really have any . . . I haven't really decided on a major. I'm taking just the requirements, a bit of everything, I guess you can say. 

00:51:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. But it's not usual for you to be alone so much and not go to class at all? 

00:51:10
ANNIE Well, it is usual, for the last couple of years. Um, you know, I went back to school last year because I was hoping to get a job, but then, you can't really get a good job without a degree, um, so I went back to school to, you know, quickly get a degree and then uh, you know, get a job and help out with the finances at home, and . . . But the reason I went back to school was because my husband lost his job, and so I'm worried about the finances, but now, you know, he's, he's got a new job and it's looking pretty stable, you know, so . . . You know, he was saying how I don't, I don't need to go back to school, you know, that we're okay, so, you know, I guess I didn't think it'd be . . . Yeah. At some point I go back to class. 

00:52:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. (ph)Where, (ph)well, did something change in your feelings about being a student and trying for your degree? 

00:52:20
ANNIE Yeah, yeah it was, it was kind of scary at first, cuz I haven't been to school in 10 years, about 10 years. That was kind of, you know . . . I thought it'd be hard to be with all, like, you know, the 18 year old's, but, at the community college where I'm going, there's, there's a couple of, you know, a good number of students who are older, so it's been great getting to talk to them, so it's actually been not as difficult as I thought it would be and not as scary as I thought it would be. It's actually been pretty fun. 

00:53:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you were getting in the groove, starting to enjoy it, get to know people, and it was bothering you less that you were around people who were so much younger. Did something really change when your husband said you don't need to keep going? Did something get discouraging for you or anything like that? 

00:53:25
ANNIE Well, we don't . . . Yeah. I don't need to work, you know, cuz he can provide for us now, so I don't need to work, um, and plus I'm not, I've never been an A student anyway, um, so it's not like it's gonna miss me much. 

00:53:45
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I beg your pardon? I didn't catch that. 

00:53:45
ANNIE It's not like the school's, the class is gonna miss me much, you know? I'm not like the most provocative student with the greatest ideas or anything, so . . . 

00:53:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. When you, when you realized you didn't have to go anymore and there wasn't such a strong outward reason to go, did you feel discouraged or, or did you feel down or blue about it? 

00:54:10
ANNIE Yeah. 

00:54:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Because it sounds like your friend got worried about you. 

00:54:15
ANNIE Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:54:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Did you feel depressed about it or a feeling of giving up or did it just feel like fitting back into your normal life? 

00:54:25
ANNIE Yeah, fitting back into my normal life, and I, I miss my friends at school, I miss going to class. It was fun. 

00:54:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Because it seems like you've got some conflict about it, some feelings of, "Yes, it was good to go," but then, some feelings of not wanting to go anymore, and I wonder if you have any sense of being torn about it. 

00:54:55
ANNIE If I could, I would go. 

00:55:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Yeah. 

00:55:00
ANNIE But it cost money . . . 

00:55:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Sure. 

00:55:05
ANNIE . . . and, you know, it's also good to have a sort of family, so if I go to school and get my degree and . . . It won't be able to start that family, and I don't really know what I would do with it any after I graduate, so . . . 

00:55:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Was there any hesitation that you detect or anything within that stop you from getting your degree for yourself, for, for your own purposes, for how you felt about yourself. Is there anything inside holding you back? 

00:55:50
ANNIE Well, I mean, I don't . . . It's okay if I don't get my degree because, like I said, you know, I'm not the best student. 

00:56:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, I wonder if I heard any bit of hesitation to continue on because of any self-criticism about not having such high 4.0 grades that you couldn't feel free just to get whatever grades were natural to you or sort of fell within the rang that you might normally get. I wonder if there was any self-criticism holding you back. 

00:56:30
ANNIE I guess. Well, yeah. Yeah, I guess. 

00:56:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Does it feel like something that's fairly strong, something that, that's a barrier to going when you might otherwise go? 

00:56:45
ANNIE I mean, there's other factors, you know? I guess the self-criticism is one of the factors. I guess I don't . . . You know how some people are just, you know, born to do certain things, and I'm just not what I'm born to do because I'm not really good at it, you know? So . . . 

00:57:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you feel born to um, have a family, have babies, and continue on that way, being a mother in your household? 

00:57:15
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Did you feel any sense of being forced by circumstances to go to school? 

00:57:20
ANNIE Financial? (crosstalk)Financial? 

00:57:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. (crosstalk)Emotional? Any other, any other factors also? 

00:57:25
ANNIE Yep, it's really all practical, I guess. You know, I'm trying to get a practical degree . . . 

00:57:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I'm not sure I caught what the degree was going to be in. I'm sorry. What I meant to ask you: what uh, what was the major going to be? 

00:57:45
ANNIE Well, I just, I just started, um, so I haven't really declared a major yet, so I'm just getting a sense of, you know, what I'm good at, what classes I like, and um, you know, I think it'd be kind of, it'd be nice to get like an easy secretarial job, an administrator's job, you know? And even in that, you need a BA. Um, I mean, so that's what I was hoping for when I started it, or at least, you know, we talked about it, so . . . 

00:58:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And when your friend got worried about you and noticed you were staying away more, um, do you think agreed with her worry? Do you think you, in any way, agreed there was something to be concerned about, that, maybe you were missing out on something? 

00:58:40
ANNIE I mean, I do feel like I'm missing out on something, but I don't really think it's anything to be concerned about. I'm missing out on, you know, meeting my friends and talking about things we learned and I'm missing out on, you know, really fun lectures and learning new skills and really cool projects, but I don't think it's of any concern. I guess she did though. 

00:59:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Yeah, yeah. Maybe a little sense that you, you would fit well as a mother and being at home, but you were getting going as a student and you were really enjoying, you know, sort of spreading your wings in that way. 

00:59:20
ANNIE Yeah, it was different (ph)than (ph)I . . . Yeah. 

00:59:25
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Was there ever a time before this in your life, earlier than you can remember, that you started to do something pretty something pretty important to you that started feeling really good, and then you found yourself pulling back for some reason? 

00:59:45
ANNIE Not really, cuz always, what I wanted to do has always been what's been best for my family, so it's always been pretty easy to just do what, you know, is expected. 

01:00:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Do you think you had done that all along? I think you might be telling me you had done that all along, um, feeling like you would do what your family wanted or needed you to do? 

01:00:20
ANNIE I guess, but it was also what I wanted, what I, what I wanted. 

01:00:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, you anticipated my next question; uh, what would happen if there were times where what you wanted to do and what the family wanted to do went, went in two different directions? You're saying most of the time it didn't, but I wonder if there are any times you can remember where maybe it started to go in two different directions, where something that you wanted that was very important to you went off in another direction than what your family needed? 

01:00:55
ANNIE Well, I, I guess, I mean, I guess the biggest thing was moving out here to Seattle with my husband, because my family's on the east coast, so they wanted us to stay there, but that, you know, was difficult, but they understood, cuz, you know, I'm the wife, that my husband's family is here, so they understood that that's what it's, should happen and live with him here. 

01:01:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So there's some tradition within your family where, some long-standing tradition where I, you, you would be fitting in well with what your family of origin wanted, your wants would be in line with theirs, but, in this case, it changed, and your wants would be in line with what your husband needed, uh, the family to do, to move? 

01:01:55
ANNIE And also, it's for financial reasons, cuz a job was here. 

01:02:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. What does he do? 

01:02:00
ANNIE IT. 

01:02:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you left your family and came, came out here. Did you have any feelings of hesitancy about leaving or perhaps wanting to stay? 

01:02:15
ANNIE Yeah, I didn't want to leave. 

01:02:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. How did you handle that? How did you go about dealing with those feelings of wanting to stay? 

01:02:25
[sil.] 

01:02:30
ANNIE I haven't really talked about it or handled it. It's just, you, I new we had to move, right? So (ph)talking about those things just doesn't . . . It's not, it's not necessary to talk about those things. 

01:02:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you didn't talk about them out loud with anybody? There was nobody who could hear, maybe, your hesitancies to go? 

01:03:00
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:03:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And you kept it within? 

01:03:00
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:03:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, in the privacy of your own mind, where nobody else could hear and know how you really felt, um, how, how did you feel about going and leaving behind everything you knew? 

01:03:15
ANNIE I felt really scared, and I don't have any friends here. 

01:03:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Except for school? 

01:03:25
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. I was really scared. 

01:03:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I wondered, in hearing about this, if there was any longer pattern, for you, of taking feelings like you were describing and pushing them down a bit to keep them out of your mind, feelings that maybe went at cross purposes to your family, having no one to talk to about them and not thinking much about them yourself? 

01:03:55
ANNIE Yeah. We don't do that in my family. 

01:03:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. To talk to each other about these (crosstalk)things? 

01:04:00
ANNIE Yeah, I mean, I could do it with my girlfriends back home, but, you know, you lose touch with them, and it hasn't been easy making girlfriends here, so I don't really - yeah - have, I guess, have no one to talk to about that, so . . . 

01:04:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. They seem like very sad, lonely feelings, in hearing about them. 

01:04:25
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:04:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. May I offer you a tissue? 

01:04:30
ANNIE Oh, great. Thanks. 

01:04:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Sure. 

01:04:35
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:04:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So, mostly, the way you've handled it is to keep things inside and try hard not to think about them much? 

01:04:45
ANNIE Yeah, I guess that's about right, yeah. 

01:04:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Yet you feel them anyway? 

01:04:55
ANNIE Yeah, I guess I feel them when I'm by myself, you know, and there's no one to talk to, it's in my head, but I'm fine when there's other people around, you know?I'm actually really when other people is around, (crosstalk)when my husband's around. 

01:05:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. (crosstalk)So outwardly you can, you can feel happy and outwardly you can feel adjusted about these things, but, inwardly, there's some sadness and some distress about it? 

01:05:25
ANNIE But only when I'm alone, you know? When I'm with my people, when I'm with my husband, I don't think about these things; I don't dwell on these feelings, you know? 

01:05:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you can move away from your real feelings by not thinking about them, sort of pushing them away a bit and not seeing them as practical or useful feelings? 

01:05:50
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:05:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Do they seem to be unimportant to you? 

01:05:55
ANNIE They're just feelings, so . . . It'll pass. 

01:06:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So, I, just in watching you, I, I get a sense of how you take care of these feelings. You concentrate on the feelings passing and not brooding about them and sort of keeping them outside of your awareness, yet I also see you're aware they're there. I wonder if they have anything to do with being sadder or more lonely or more down, when you really think about it and you're just by yourself. I also wondered if they make you a feel little bit disloyal to, to your family, to feel like there's an education you want or places you might want to be that are a little different from what they want? 

01:06:50
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:06:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Kind of a secretly disloyal feeling? 

01:06:55
ANNIE Yeah, I wouldn't call it disloyal. It'd be more like unappreciative. 

01:07:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. As though you had been unappreciative of, of them? 

01:07:10
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:07:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And the intensity makes me think this really isn't new, this has maybe got a history with you? 

01:07:15
ANNIE Yeah, I guess so, yeah. 

01:07:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I was wondering how far back you can remember feeling this way, maybe even all the way back to the first time you remember struggling like this, maybe secretly struggling. 

01:07:40
ANNIE Struggling between . . . 

01:07:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Keeping these feelings down and outside of your awareness so that you don't find yourself feeling unappreciative of, of them. 

01:07:50
[sil.] 

01:07:55
ANNIE I don't . . . I mean, I guess it's always been that way, I guess, you know? Because it's always been, like, if I . . . I guess my parents have always told me what I needed to do for the family, and so if I'm not, then I'm not . . . Cuz they've sacrificed so much for me, you know, and my brother that, growing up, I couldn't really do what I wanted to do because it's not in line with what's good for the family and it's not in line with helping out with the rest of the family, so, growing up, I guess little, silly little things like wanting to go out with my friends instead of staying home and taking care of my brother, I guess? You know? So . . . 

01:08:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I wondered if it was a guilty feeling when you wanted to go out and do, do some of your own thing, and you were very clear on that: to help out, you would stay home with your brother. 

01:09:05
ANNIE Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:09:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. How old is he, by the way, in relation to you? 

01:09:15
ANNIE Oh, well he's - let's see, I'm 31 - so he's 27, 26. 

01:09:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So significantly younger? 

01:09:20
ANNIE About four or five years. 

01:09:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Anybody else in your family? 

01:09:25
ANNIE No, that's it. 

01:09:25
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you were the eldest, and it does sound like you really pitched in and helped out with him and that there was this expectation that you would put family first and maybe put yourself, as an individual, more, more in second position? 

01:09:45
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:09:45
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I can see it made you really sad. I wonder if you ever had any other feelings about it? 

01:09:55
ANNIE (ph)Yeah, (ph)um . . . 

01:09:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Maybe even feelings you thought you weren't supposed to have? 

01:10:00
ANNIE Yeah, sometimes, it just seems unfair. Yeah. It just seems unfair. 

01:10:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. To have to give up so much to help, to help the family, which you really wanted to do, but, but maybe you also felt there was something more for you? 

01:10:25
ANNIE I mean, I don't know if there was really . . . I don't know if there was any more for me, um, but to do, you know, little, stupid things like hang out with my friends. It just seems kind of unfair, you know? 

01:10:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Maybe they weren't so little and stupid to you. What sort of things did you want to do that you found you just couldn't let yourself do? 

01:10:50
ANNIE I, I mean, like, you know, sleep-overs. Those, those, those silly little things; sleepovers, you know? Yeah. Sleepovers, um, moving, moving out after high school, going away for college, cuz I, I tried, um, you know, I tried college for, I think, a quarter, right after high school, but I didn't do really well. I failed out, and so, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not good in school, you know, and I didn't work that hard either, and my time was pre-occupied with other things, you know? My hus-, my boyfriend, who is my husband now, and, you know, being home also, you know . . . Yeah. 

01:11:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I wonder if you feel any connection between stopping or almost stopping college now for your family and trying and stopping college just after high school. 

01:12:10
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:12:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. With the feeling of giving something important to you up for your family now and back then? 

01:12:25
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. (ph)I (ph)can't think about that . . . Yeah, it's pretty similar, I guess. 

01:12:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So for a long time, you felt like you had to give things up for other people, and you've been a real soldier about it, but it looks like you've got your own private feelings about it, that it's, in some ways, not satisfying for you. 

01:12:55
ANNIE Yeah, but it's not like . . . Like I said, I'm not a good student, so it's not like I'm, I'm sacrificing . . . I wasn't sacrificing that much anyway, so it's not like it was that big of a sacrifice. 

01:13:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So when you, you need or want to, you can sort of cool these feelings off by, by saying it wasn't that big, it was maybe small and stupid or not a big sacrifice? And that kind of controls, maybe, how much sadness you'd feel about it? If you see what I mean. 

01:13:30
ANNIE Yeah, (crosstalk)yeah. 

01:13:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. (crosstalk)And I was struck by how you feel you were such a poor student and, because you didn't get top grades, it sounds like you're saying you didn't deserve to go if you didn't get a certain kind of grade, so it wasn't . . . You didn't feel free to do it just because you wanted to? You had, you had to get a certain grade and maybe perform at a certain level to feel like you deserve to go to college? 

01:14:00
ANNIE Yeah, I'm not gonna do well if I go, (ph)right? So . . . 

01:14:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. That's a very strong feeling with you, isn't it, that if you don't well, why do it, and if you don't do very well, how is it worth it? 

01:14:15
ANNIE Yeah, if it's not practical, why do it? 

01:14:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I, I hear your idea loud and, loud and clear, but what I don't hear is a, a feeling of freedom to do things because they please you, um, because they'd produce growth for you, because you'd be able to have more of something that you wanted. 

01:14:40
ANNIE I don't know. I don't, I don't really know what I what want, I don't really know what I want. 

01:14:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, when you think about it, what comes to mind? 

01:15:00
[sil.] 

01:15:05
ANNIE I wanna have both; I wanna have a family, but also go to school. 

01:15:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So, if you were able, you'd cut yourself off from either area? 

01:15:20
ANNIE Right, but I think that's time's passed. 

01:15:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Pardon me? 

01:15:20
ANNIE I think that's time's passed, cuz if I,if I stuck with my, if I stuck with college right after high school, I could've done that, you know, and then have my, have kids this time, now, but I didn't do that back then, and so I think I can't have both. 

01:15:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So the idea is you, you cannot have both; if you missed your chance back then, you can't have that chance again in the here and now? 

01:16:00
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:16:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Raises the question in my mind if you might be doing something now in a very similar way to what you did when you were much younger. 

01:16:15
ANNIE What do you mean? 

01:16:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. If you might be holding yourself back now from much the same thing, a family and an education, in the same way that you were holding yourself back just after high school, having an education and then going on and having a family. 

01:16:35
ANNIE In co- . . . In high school, you know, I didn't have (ph)to (ph)spend much time on my, the reading of the things of the math and science and still did pretty okay on the test, but I went to college and I, I, I thought I could do that, too, and I couldn't, so I was spending more time with him and putting the same amount of effort as I did in high school in those subjects, but, it didn't work out. 

01:17:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So your grades, your grades fell when it was harder to get the kind of grades you wanted, when you were spending so much time with your husband? And, as you saw that happening, what did you think about it as you had a chance to see what was happening to your grades? 

01:17:30
ANNIE It's no big deal. I felt, well . . . I was kind of ashamed of them because I thought I was smart, but I guess I wasn't as smart as I thought I was. 

01:17:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So we can hear this little bit of self-criticism come through. You know, you handled your feelings by saying, "I wasn't as smart; I wasn't as good at it," um, kind of, kind of knocking yourself down a little bit. Can you tell me . . . Has that, has that been characteristic of you, to uh, to find your faults and flaws, or, when you see you're not doing as well, to, uh, to be self-critical about it? 

01:18:25
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:18:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I was wondering what you tell yourself at those times, what you say to yourself? 

01:18:35
ANNIE I could've done better. If I worked hard enough, if I was smart enough . . . 

01:18:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So this theme of not being good enough, not being smart enough, um . . . You can pretty, pretty readily hear that. I was wondering what you think about it. 

01:19:05
[sil.] 

01:19:10
ANNIE I don't know, I don't know. It's just who I am, I guess. I don't really thinking about it; it's just who I am. 

01:19:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Now that we are here and we are thinking about it, um, and you're saying it's just who you are, I wondered if you could say more about that. I wanted to understand that a little bit better. 

01:19:35
ANNIE Well, I've never been, like, you know, the model student; I've never been the A student, growing up. I've, I've never been the best at anything. It's always, it's always, you know . . . I'm average, you know? I'm average. 

01:19:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So sometimes it feels okay, it feels okay with you, but it also looked, to me, like it made you sad to think about yourself that way, to think about yourself as somebody who couldn't earn a college degree, couldn't do well, and maybe didn't deserve to be there. It looks like it made you a little bit uh, concerned and sad. 

01:20:15
ANNIE Yeah, yeah, but it's okay, you know? Not, not everyone's made out to be like, you know, Einstein. 

01:20:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Sure. 

01:20:30
ANNIE You know? And, I mean, we each have different roles to play, you know? We have a roles that's, you know, set up for us in this world, you know, and my role isn't to be an inventor or the president . . . 

01:20:45
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Or a college graduate or a college student? 

01:20:45
ANNIE Yeah, and that, and that's okay. It's not what, it's not meant for everyone; it's not meant for me. 

01:20:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, I can see how you deal with the feelings. Uh, you're able to tell yourself it's not for you, you aren't missing out on anything after all, it's, it's somehow all okay, but, in the private voice of your mind, you have also sounded sad and upset about it, a little bit like there's a collision of these two ways of feeling. On the one hand it's okay; you're not cut out for it. But on the other hand, you'd really wanted it; you'd really wanted the friends and the interesting courses and to see where that might've taken you. 

01:21:35
ANNIE Yeah. I think that would've been great, that would've been great 10 years ago, you know, but I don't think that's the right time for it now. 

01:21:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. What is it time for, now? 

01:21:55
ANNIE Family, and we're gonna start having kids soon, because we're financially ready and things are stable now, so it's time for family now. 

01:22:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Time for just this one thing, uh, that you had pictured, but not more than just this one area? 

01:22:15
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:22:25
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And what's your role in all of it? 

01:22:25
ANNIE The caretaker. A caretaker. 

01:22:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. You'll take of all of, all of these people in your family and do the right thing for them? 

01:22:40
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:22:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, you're smiling about it, so, and you've been, you've been smiling about it at the same time that you have tears in your eyes about it. 

01:22:50
ANNIE Yeah, I guess it's just, it's just regret. I think it's just regret for had to have gotten married so young and not have done that in the past, when I could've done it. 

01:23:05
SHERI HUNT, M.D. What had you done in the past that you felt you, you were stopped from doing that you wish you had done? 

01:23:15
ANNIE I wish I had stayed in college. 

01:23:15
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I just wanted to be clear that I, I heard that. 

01:23:20
ANNIE Yeah. I have some friends back home who, you know, who got their degree and, and then, and um, and they have careers and they travel and then go out to these shows and clubs and . . . Yeah. I don't think I, I don't think I did that when I was that, I didn't do that. 

01:23:45
SHERI HUNT, M.D. What stopped you inside? What held you back from within? 

01:23:50
ANNIE I wanted to spend time with my husband, my partner, and just, you know, and that was fun, too, you know? It was great to spend time with him. 

01:24:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. But, somehow, never weighed to have both or to have the additional things that you wanted. I wondered if there was anyone very close to you in your family that had also lived in this way, anybody that was right in your nuclear family that had given up more for family life, maybe done similar things to what you're doing. 

01:24:30
ANNIE I guess, in terms, in terms of nuclear family, I guess it would be my mom, um, you know? She had to work, you know, while we were growing up, so . . . And my parents didn't have any, much friends either. It was just the nuclear family and were just supporting each other and they, they didn't have any f-, you know, really close friends. They didn't hang out with their friends on the weekend. It was just the four of us. 

01:25:00
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And you were all living on the east coast? 

01:25:00
ANNIE Yes, so, yeah. It's just the way things have been. 

01:25:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Was it mainly you and your mother who lived this way? Um, you had, you had your father and your brother. Was it mainly you and your mother who felt the necessity to be so devoted to family? 

01:25:30
ANNIE I think my dad was too, cuz he worked a lot, you know? When he had free time . . . He had one day off and, you know, he would spend it with us, but the other six days, he was working. I think my brother had the most freedom. He got to hang out with his friends more than I did, and he, he's actually finished his degree. 

01:25:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And no harm came to the family because of it and he did okay, he found a way to do these things that he wanted to do? 

01:26:05
ANNIE Well, yeah, but he's the boy of the family, the son of the family. 

01:26:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And you're a daughter of the family. It sounds like you had, you know, you really had the idea that the women and the daughters live a certain way, and maybe make a lot of sacrifices. 

01:26:20
ANNIE Yeah, but it's not really a sacrifice anyway cuz I'm not, I've never been good at, you know, when I tried, so it's not that big of a sacrifice. My brother is smart, you know? My brother's capable, you know? And . . . Yeah. 

01:26:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So we might be hearing that self-criticism come up again. You compare yourself to him. It somehow sounds like you didn't feel you measured up and should be able to get to do the same things. 

01:26:55
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. It's just . . . Yeah. He had more freedom, I guess, cuz he was the youngest, you know? 

01:27:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, you're smiling, but you're crying when you talk about it, so, again, it sounds to me like a little bit of tension between - maybe more than a little bit - tension between these ways that you feel. 

01:27:20
ANNIE Yeah, it's unfair. It definitely (ph)sits (ph)in (ph)fair, cuz he was the son. That was definitely unfair. Yeah, so I think that was unfair. 

01:27:35
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Maybe you were also influenced by how your mother was doing things, maybe pretty deeply affected by how she was doing things, but the daughters could be a certain way and the sons could be another way. 

01:27:50
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:27:55
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I thought I might've seen a little bit of frustration when you talked about that, maybe just a hint of uh, some frustration, and I wondered if you ever felt angry about the boy, the son gets to do these things and you don't. 

01:28:10
ANNIE Yeah, it's unfair. It's really unfair. 

01:28:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Can you say more about that? That's a pretty strong feeling for you also, how you felt. 

01:28:25
ANNIE It just seems kinda silly now, you know, like, just unfair that he's never, he was never pestered or, you know, annoyed, you know, to do chores around the house, to cook, to clean, and I, I've always, I've always had to do it. I've always been the one that is pestered to do it. 

01:28:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. When you say pestered, what sort of things happened when, when you were supposed to do something? 

01:28:55
ANNIE If I, well, if I didn't do it, my parents would, you know, yell at me nag me to do it, and, you know, if I didn't do it I was la-, I was called lazy. 

01:29:10
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you were criticized if you didn't, if you didn't do these things that the women in the family were expected to do? 

01:29:15
ANNIE Well, I needed to learn how to do it anyway, because if I didn't do it I wouldn't be a good mom later on, so I needed to learn anyway. 

01:29:25
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, you are very good at finding these rational (ph)root (ph)seeds for these things, and you seem to do it right when a strong feeling comes up. This time, when you, when you know you felt very angry at the way you were being treated. Yep, the anger's there. 

01:29:45
ANNIE Yeah, you're right, you're right. When I get angry, i tend to rationalize it away, don't I? 

01:29:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Yeah, yeah. Maybe that strong anger worries you in some way, or bothers you in some way. What comes to mind when you think about being angry long ago about those things, may be even being angry now? 

01:30:15
ANNIE I don't like to be angry. Angry, angry makes the house really uncomfortable, you know, and uh, not livable. I, I like harmony; I like peace, you know? So I don't like when I'm angry. I don't even know if I can be angry, actually. I don't think I've ever been angry. 

01:30:40
SHERI HUNT, M.D. So you have these ways of making your anger dissipate and go away quickly; it will disrupt the peace and the harmony of the house, maybe of you too. Well, I'm struck by how sad you are about all this and that there is anger there about these things you've given up now and you've given up so long ago. It does make me wonder if there's an underlying pattern to all this? What about you? 

01:31:15
ANNIE Yeah, there's definitely a pattern, yeah, there's definitely a pattern. 

01:31:25
SHERI HUNT, M.D. And maybe you are deeply affected by these things and your friend caught on and was encouraging you to find someone to talk about these things with, no matter what you choose to find someone to talk about these things with so that you don't have to hold them alone inside all the time. 

01:31:45
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. You're right. She did see that. 

01:31:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Because, though you're able to do well and you're able to get whatever done in your life you need to, you've got a lot of strong feelings. I think it might help for you to meet with me and talk about them, at least until you get to know some of this a bit better. 

01:32:15
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. That sounds, actually, okay. 

01:32:20
SHERI HUNT, M.D. I can meet with you next week again, on Friday, at this time. Would that work out for you? 

01:32:30
ANNIE Yeah, that's fine. 

01:32:30
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Well, I'm glad, I'm glad you've decided to do that, and I'm very pleased to have met you. Why don't we plan, then, next Friday at this time, and we can, we can explore some of these issues, some of these feelings that you seem to push away and have a hard time with, okay? 

01:32:45
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:32:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. Okay. Well, I'm glad to have met you and I'll see you (crosstalk)again. 

01:32:50
ANNIE (crosstalk)Likewise, thank you. 

01:32:50
SHERI HUNT, M.D. You're welcome.

5 "Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy The Psychoanalytic Paradigm Counseling Session 

01:32:55
Processing the 5 Approaches to Psychotherapy with the Client Manivong J. Ratts, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Seattle University and Annie, the client 

01:33:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Hi Annie. How are you? 

01:33:15
ANNIE Hey. I'm good, thanks. And you? 

01:33:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. I'm really good, thank you. Um, well, I just wanna say thank you for, uh, being able to work with each of our five therapists. You've had an opportunity to work with Dr. Sheri Hunt, who was really operating from a psychoanalytic perspective; um, Katherine Nordell, who was working as a CBT therapist, demonstrating elements of CBT; and you also had an opportunity to work with Steven Scheutz, who worked, uh, from a existential humanistic paradigm; um, Dr. Agnes Kwong, who was working from a multicultural framework; and then, the last therapist you worked with was Dr. Michael Hutchins, who was operating from a social justice framework . . . 

01:33:55
ANNIE Right. 

01:34:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . and what I wanted to do today was just spend some time with you to sort of process each of those sessions and if, just sort of hear from you, in terms of what you liked, didn't like about your work with each of the therapists and, and what resonated with you. Um, is that okay? 

01:34:15
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:34:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. If we can start with the psychoanalytic perspective - that was the first, uh, therapist you worked with, (crosstalk)Dr. Sheri Hunt - um, what was your experience like, um, as a client, working with her, if you can share a little bit? 

01:34:30
ANNIE (crosstalk)Right. 

01:34:30
ANNIE It felt really enlightening. Um, you know, when I was telling her my story, she just drew so many connections; my childhood and how that plays out into how I'm currently acting. Um, so, in that moment, when I sitting with her, she made so much sense and it felt very, like, "Yes, yes, yes!", you know? Everything she says make so much sense, um, and I just felt like there was a groove going on. Um, it felt, it felt really enlightening. 

01:35:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. It sounds like a lot of in-, you were gaining a lot of insight. 

01:35:10
ANNIE Right, right, but then, you know, after, after the session, and having time to think about it and process it, I felt very, I felt like I couldn't really say no, because the connections she was making make so much sense, but then it just felt a bit, it felt . . . Cuz it made so much sense, but it didn't feel pin-point. Does that make sense? Um . . . 

01:35:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Help me understand that. 

01:35:55
ANNIE Um, like, the connections made a lot of sense. However, when I, when I went home and processed it, I'm like, "Well, it could, it could've been this; it could've been that." So I feel like the conclusions were kind of assumed, but not, maybe not accurate. Does that make sense? At the moment when I was with her, she made a lot of sense, you know, so um, it was really, it was really enlightening, um, but it, I do wonder about the accuracy of it. 

01:36:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Okay. All right. 

01:36:30
ANNIE Yeah, and she just seemed so knowledgeable (crosstalk)that it was kind of hard to go, "Mmm . . ." . . . 

01:36:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:36:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. 

01:36:35
ANNIE You know? But she seemed so knowledgeable and she was drawing so many connections and so fast and, as I was telling my stories, I was very, there was a lot of stuff going on inside, you know, so I felt like it just made sense, everything she connected, and I couldn't sit down and filter it and process her, um, connections, but, at the moment, it felt like the flow was so good that I just felt like, "Yes, yes, yes!" 

01:37:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. It sounds like what I hear you saying is you really connected with her during the session, you liked the insight she was giving you . . . 

01:37:15
ANNIE Right. 

01:37:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . cuz it made a lot of se-, logical sense . . . 

01:37:15
ANNIE Right. 

01:37:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . in terms of connecting uh, with your life story, if you will. 

01:37:20
ANNIE Right. 

01:37:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. And I hear you saying, also, at the same time, you like her expertise and knowledge, uh, that she brought into, into the session. Um, I'm also hearing you say, in a sense, you wonder if, if maybe needing more time is important to be able to make sure these connections she's making, these insights are, are accurate . . . 

01:37:45
ANNIE Right. 

01:37:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . if I'm hearing you correctly . . . 

01:37:45
ANNIE Yes. 

01:37:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . once you went outside of the session and just sort of had time to process it a little bit more. 

01:37:55
ANNIE Right. 

01:37:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. 

01:37:55
ANNIE Right. 

01:37:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:37:55
ANNIE (crosstalk)Yeah. 

01:37:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Um, how about the cognitive behavioral therapist, Katherine Nordell? 

01:38:00
ANNIE Yeah, I really, I really felt like we had a really . . . It felt our relationship felt more equal, um, (crosstalk)than . . . 

01:38:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Than the first one? 

01:38:10
ANNIE Right, than with Dr. Hunt. Um, it felt more equal. Um, but I felt like . . . She focused a lot on, of course, on my, my thoughts and my feeling, um, and it, it f- . . . I, I didn't feel as listened to. Um, it just felt like there was a sort of pa-, pattern or path she wanted to drive me to, um, cuz I, I (ph)filled (ph)up my stories so much more, um, and it felt, it felt kind of narrow. 

01:38:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Okay, okay. It sounds like you're saying you felt like she had a direction that she wanted to take you in . . . 

01:38:50
ANNIE Right, right. 

01:38:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . um, and, and that felt limiting . . . 

01:38:55
ANNIE Right. 

01:38:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . but, at the same time, I'm hearing you say you felt the relationship was more egalitarian, um, you were equals in, in, in your work together, if you will, compared to with Dr. Hunt. 

01:39:10
ANNIE Right. 

01:39:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. Okay, okay. Um, anything else you like about your work with Nordell, (crosstalk)Katherine Nordell? 

01:39:15
ANNIE (crosstalk)Um, yeah. I just think that we had a really great rapport; I think I really trusted here. Yeah, I think that's, that's the thing that sticks out the most . . . 

01:39:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. 

01:39:30
ANNIE . . . the rapport we had with each other, and I felt, I just felt, yeah, it was really equal. 

01:39:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Okay. 

01:39:35
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:39:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. How about with Steven Scheutz, the therapist who was operating from an existential humanistic paradigm? What was that experience like for you? 

01:39:45
ANNIE Um, I felt kind of confused with the whole experience, cuz the questions he asked to me didn't make much sense for me to do certain things, and it felt like it was about me, me, me, and I understand that therapy is about me, but there are so many other things going on, like my family, my husband, that, to focus only on me in that bringing into the (ph)quay, equation, it felt kind of silly, not silly, but um, yeah. It just wasn't um . . . Because I can't just think about me, you know? There are other people, you know, near me, um, so it felt like um . . . I felt, it felt like, it felt like he couldn't relate to what I was going through. I remember the one, the one question about um, (ph)of (ph)getting I'm going to get the slushy question . . . You know, I, I feel like that's not me, that's not what I would do, um, and it seemed a bit strange to ask that question. I didn't think (ph)kind (ph)of (ph)irrelevant, so . . . Yeah. But, however, I did like - I think it was him - um, where he said that, you know, this is a safe space for you, for you to feel your, um, say what you want and feel your emotions, cuz I think he was the one who said that. Yeah, so I really appreciated that, cuz I didn't realize that's this is what the space is for. 

01:41:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. So you like the fact that he was able to set that tone for you? 

01:41:25
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:41:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. But I also hear you saying one of the limitations, er, that you had was you didn't feel like he truly connected with you . . . 

01:41:35
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . or understood you as an Asian-American . . . 

01:41:40
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . in terms of just looking at your family dynamics . . . 

01:41:45
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . and focusing more-so on you as an individual . . . 

01:41:45
ANNIE Right, right. 

01:41:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . uh, which I'm hearing you saying is a limited perspective of who you are . . . 

01:41:55
ANNIE Right. 

01:41:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . in relation to your experience. 

01:41:55
ANNIE Right. It felt, it felt very Western. Um, yeah, it felt very Western. 

01:42:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. It's interesting, because, with Katherine, you were talking about how it seemed like there was more direction, or she kind of knew where she was going, uh, um, and, and there was a logical sequence . . . 

01:42:15
ANNIE Yes. 

01:42:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . in terms of her work with you, and, and with Steven, what I'm hearing you say, if I'm hearing you correctly, is that there wasn't necessarily that logical progression of, of what you were doing? (crosstalk)Is that what . . . Did you feel that? 

01:42:30
ANNIE (crosstalk)Right. Yeah! It felt very much like bouncing back and forth . . . 

01:42:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Okay. 

01:42:35
ANNIE . . . the questions that were asked, um, cuz I know, um, there was some frustration, uh, cuz the way my, I answered the question, um . . . I couldn't answer the question the way he wanted me to answer it, so I could sense that he was kind of frustrated, um, because I couldn't see what he just wanted me to see, um, so I felt like he was repeating a lot of things, repeating a lot of questions in a different way to try to get me to an answer that he wants me to see. Um, yeah, so it didn't feel logical. It just felt sort of circular and like a tennis ball, back and (crosstalk)forth, back and forth. 

01:43:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is interesting, because existential humanistic theorists and practitioners tend to be, are known to be directionless, in terms of just non-directive . . . 

01:43:20
ANNIE Right. 

01:43:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . in their approach and cognitive behaviorists tend to be a little bit more, um, uh, structured in their work with clients, and it's interesting that you're pointing that out, or that you're experiencing that. 

01:43:35
ANNIE Oh, cool. 

01:43:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. How about with, uh, Dr. Agnes Kwong, the uh, multicultural therapist? 

01:43:45
ANNIE I honestly must say that I felt the most listened to with her. I felt the pacing was equal. I just . . . The pacing was really good. I just felt really listened to, and I felt like she had no agenda, um, and she just listened, so yeah, I think (crosstalk)the pacing . . . 

01:44:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)What, what, what were things she was doing that made you feel connected or that you were feeling listened to? Were there things in the session that was happening? 

01:44:20
ANNIE I think a lot of it was body language, you know? Um, yeah. It's just the way, maybe, she says, "Mm-hmm," you know? I can't pinpoint, I can't remember any exact phrases . . . 

01:44:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Yeah. 

01:44:35
ANNIE . . . but just, I just felt listened to. Just those simple, maybe verbal and facial responses. Yeah, I just felt really listened to, listened at with her. Um, yeah. 

01:44:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Did you feel that uh, her, uh, racial identity sort of uh, uh, helped in terms of you connecting with her or have an influence in your ability to connect with her, the fact that you were both Asian females? 

01:45:10
ANNIE I think, maybe, but I'm not quite sure, because I felt, I feel more equal with um, Katherine . . . 

01:45:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Okay. 

01:45:15
ANNIE . . . in terms of, like, just personality and um . . . Not personality, but just equal, but with (ph)Nancy, (ph)with Dr. Kwong, she felt a little bit more knowledgeable (ph)whether I am, but still, there's still that sense of like, caring, I guess, so . . . I, I don't know exactly what it is that made me, it feel that way with her. I'm not quite sure. If it is our similar identity, culture identity . . . I'm not (crosstalk)quite sure. 

01:45:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. What was your experience like with Dr. Michael Hutchins? He was really operating from a social justice framework and did something a little bit different . . . 

01:45:55
ANNIE Right, (crosstalk)um . . . 

01:46:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk) . . . than the other therapists. 

01:46:00
ANNIE Yeah. Uh, he did stuff I didn't that counseling do, um, and I liked that he thought out of the box and helped me find new sources and other options, so that part I really liked, cuz I saw a bigger picture of what counseling can do, um, but, similar to CBT, it felt very directed. Um, I just felt I was answering questions like back and, back and, like . . . I just, I was just constantly answering questions. I didn't feel like he really knew me. I just felt like I just kept answering the questions that he had for me, so . . . 

01:46:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Well, now that you've had an opportunity to work with all five therapists, if there was a therapist you were gonna continue working with, who might that be? 

01:46:50
ANNIE Um, I think, personally, I think I'm a better fit with Dr. Kwo-, um, Dr. Kwong, um, and perhaps it is because we're the same, um, same culture background. Um, I just felt . . . It's the fact that I felt really listened to. I felt like she saw me and she heard me. I felt like she didn't rush me and I think that the directions the other counselors went . . . I think if I had more time with her, she would've gone those directions also, um, and it was only our first session. Um, yeah, so I like to think that, you know, if we had more time, we would've gone . . . Cuz she did ask a bit about my childhood, um, like um, Dr. Hunt, and she did ask about stuff I was thinking and feeling, like, um, Katherine, um, um . . . Yeah, so . . . 

01:47:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. So she kind of brought elements of other theories, you felt, in your work with her . . . 

01:48:00
ANNIE Right. 

01:48:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . or in her work with you? 

01:48:00
ANNIE Right. 

01:48:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. She had a little bit of everything . . . 

01:48:05
ANNIE I think so. 

01:48:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. . . . and that culture (ph)piece . . . It sounds like, was important for you? 

01:48:10
ANNIE Yeah, yeah, (crosstalk)so I think . . . And it was only one session, so I think that more sessions, um, we could've gotten all the other stuff out, perhaps, um, but yeah, the most important thing? I just felt really listened to. 

01:48:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. 

01:48:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS, PH.D. Well, I just wanna thank you for your time and for um, giving of yourself and sharing your, your uh, your experiences with each of the therapists. I really appreciate it, and I know students who watch this video will as well, so thank you. 

01:48:40
