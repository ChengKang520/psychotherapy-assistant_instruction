00:01:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Hello, my name is Michael D'Andrea and we're delighted to be here, to share with you some techniques that we views and found to be effective in dealing in multi-cultural counseling and psychotherapy sessions. We're joined today by my colleagues, Bryan Kim and Judy Daniels and Mahealani. In a family counseling situation, ah, Bryan has come to this session uhm, looking for some relief of chronic pain with headaches and tense muscles and gastrointestinal ah, ah, ah, condition that his been refer from his physician. What we hope to demonstrate today is looking at the three main areas of multi-cultural counseling confidence. That is, how does the White European therapist able to utilize multi-cultural counseling awareness, knowledge and skills to effectively assist the client in self exploring some of the issues and challenges that he or she faces in their lives. Bryan? 

00:02:20
BRYAN KIM Yes, what we like to do is uhm, really illustrate some of the values that multi-cultural ah, ca, ah, researchers and scholars have written about Asian-American culture and particularly values that affect Korean-Americans and uhm, for example, one of the values that affect Korean-Americans in their behavior is uhm, shame and this uhm, really uhm, embarrassment in terms of uhm, seeking psychological assistance uhm, another value that I would like to illustrate is ah, the sense of, his value of emotional self-control or uhm, this ah, lack of uhm, wanting to express any negative emotions in particular. Also, we'd like to uhm, illustrate ah, the sense of respect for authorities that ah, Korean-Americans ah, value and uhm, adhere to. Ah, fourth, we'd like to also illustrate ah, the sense of filial piety and importance of family that uhm, Korean-Americans I think, really value uhm, also we like to illustrate ah, the value of humility and being humble and not wanting to bribe about achievements and ah, uhm, and uhm, any ah, accomplishment that a Korean-American might have had uhm, and lastly, we like to also try to illustrate uhm, the sense collectivism that Korean-Americans uhm, really value and uhm, the sense of group ah, oneness that uhm, they value. 

00:03:40
JUDY DANIELS  In this session, there's a lot of complexity and we're gonna try to show some of the different dynamics in complexity that have to do with gender issues as well as ah, multi-cultural, cross-cultural ah, dynamic between ah, European-Americans and the Korean-American. 

00:03:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  As we go through this marriage counseling session, we're gonna try to make it as real to life as possible and so with the assistance of Mahaelani, we're going to demonstrate what a therapist might do with a young child and a hmm, bi-racial couple as we try to demonstrate some of the multi-cultural competencies we've talked about. Hi, Bryan. (crosstalk)

00:05:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and she can just make herself comfortable but again, I'm really delighted that you've taken time to comeback. I know, in our initial meeting it was short and we talked a little bit about what goes on in counseling and, and that we talked about the issue of confidentiality and before we go on, I wanted to check with you and see if you had any questions. 

00:05:30
BRYAN KIM Uhm, no, I, I can't think of any questions at this point but I really appreciate the fact that were gonna keep everything that we talked about her in confidence... (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
BRYAN KIM ...uhm, because I'm feeling a bit embarrassed about, coming here and... (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
BRYAN KIM ...you know, frankly speaking uhm, uhm, bit a sh, bit ashamed about uhm, having these kind of difficulties... (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
BRYAN KIM ...you know, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
BRYAN KIM so I really appre, appreciate it if we can keep this in confidence. 

00:05:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And you can, you can trust that I will keep this in confidence as we talked about in, in our initial short meeting together. 

00:06:00
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA You know, if, if, in preparing for our, our meeting here this morning, I was thinking that, we, we improbably share some things in common but we also assure some differences, for instance, we have some gender differences here with males and females joining together, and Bryan, you talked about coming from Korea and moving here several years ago... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
BRYAN KIM Yeah. 

00:06:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and I am aware that they are some differences between men and women and persons from different ah, cultural or racial backgrounds. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And ah, I've, I've learned to really respect those differences and while I've learned a little bit about Asian cultures in general and Korean culture in particular, little bit about women, and differences between women and men in counseling, I really would like to invite you to kinda help me ah, get a better understanding as we walk through this counseling work together. (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
BRYAN KIM Hmm. 

00:06:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  Uhm, I really want you to know that my interest is to respect both of you and to try to assist you in finding ways of ah, Bryan you talked about these headaches that have been troubling you and your lower backaches and things like that. 

00:07:05
BRYAN KIM  Yeah. 

00:07:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA But I did wanna take a couple of minutes Bryan ah, to ask you and Judy, you might be able to help with this... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...is to get a better understanding, make sure I'm clear of the Korean culture and how it might play into your life. And I, I, jotted down some notes about values... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
BRYAN KIM Hmm. 

00:07:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...that seem to be particularly important to some Korean-Americans and I wanted to see how they fit with you. Uhm, and I notice that they were six particular values that researchers had talked about and one of those was the whole issue that you brought up about shame and you, you we, you said that that's an important thing to you, your kind of embarrassed to be here today. 

00:07:45
BRYAN KIM  Yeah, yeah, uhm, really I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable you know, seeking uhm, psychological help from someone, (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
BRYAN KIM uhm, other than my family members and I'm really embarrassed that I'm not able to control the stresses that are in my life... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:08:00
BRYAN KIM  and uhm, and there's a sense of that I need to conform toward everyone else, you know, my family and in my culture, doing ah, we tend not to, you know, see a counselor when we have problems so, I'm, I'm a bit uncomfortable about this counseling bit and I'm, I'm not sure what to expect. So I actually appreciate your asking about the shame, yeah. 

00:08:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  Well, I wanna let you know, how much I appreciate in spite of being ah, embarrass and feeling that way, that you've taken time to come here today and I know, you have encouragement and support from Judy to be here. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uhm, but again I, I appreciate you doing that and hopefully you can find this worthwhile, the time that we spend together. Beside shame, the other value that seem to stand out in things I've read and I need to check this with you, Bryan, this is whole idea of emotional self-control? 

00:08:50
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. Well, uhm, it's really difficult for me to express any kind of uhm, emotions particularly if they're negative emotions... (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
BRYAN KIM ...and uhm, there's a sense that I need to really withhold any emotions that I'm feeling and uhm, but I also realize that, you know, any emotions that I'm feeling are affecting Judy and Mahaelani... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
BRYAN KIM ...and uhm, that perhaps, you know, I need to uhm, do something about them but, yeah, I really feel uncomfortable about expressing any emotions and try to hold that in. 

00:09:20
JUDY DANIELS And I think, one of the main reasons why we're, why we're here is that, you know, as a couple and as a family we have a lot of stress because we just have the birth of this new ah, baby and ah, and so I think, ah, that's a really important part and I think, Bryan's been uhm, trying to deal with the whole emotional aspect of it all. 

00:09:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  And both of you being professional folks and working and having this beautiful seven month old daughter is a lot to carry but your to be really recommended for kinda juggling all of these things and Bryan, I wanted you to know, that sometimes in television, in the movies we see people in counseling and there's a lot of emotional expression going on and the therapist really encourage is that, but that's only one aspect or type of counseling... (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
BRYAN KIM Hmm. 

00:10:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and here when we work together, I want you to know, that I wanna really respect and honor this notion of self-control. I think, that's an important strength and rather than looking at emotional release says some therapist who, maybe the three of us can work together to kind of brainstorm and problem solve and look at different ways of dealing with some of the stresses going on. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
BRYAN KIM Hmm. Yeah, if you relive the bit. 

00:10:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA If you relive the bit. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
BRYAN KIM Yeah. 

00:10:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA I'm glad. The third value, I found very interesting was the respect for authority and ah, ah, ah, I wonder how that gets played out for you, is that something that's an important values of Korean-American? 

00:10:45
BRYAN KIM Yeah, I've been, you know, having grown up in Korea, I've been raised to really respect elders ah, people in authority figures. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  Uh hmm. 

00:10:55
BRYAN KIM Uhm, and for example, uhm, the reason why were here is that our uhm, medical doctor, a physician, you know, suggested that we seek psychological help. (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
BRYAN KIM (coughs) and that uhm, and he's been very helpful with my parentsin, in their health... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
BRYAN KIM ...uhm, so I really respect his ah, recommendations and what he says so I, uhm, you know, they recommend ah, ah, due to appreciate what ah, people who are in the authority figures who are very knowledge about different areas, you know, what they have to say and uhm, take to heart of their recommendations and suggestions. 

00:11:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Yeah, I know, that your doctors spoke highly of you and we did talk briefly on the phone as I mentioned to you, so, his another support person, someone you respect very much. (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
BRYAN KIM Yeah, hmm. 

00:11:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA The, the importance of the family stood out as something with Asian cultures in general, and particularly with Korean ah, persons from Korean ancestry. 

00:11:40
BRYAN KIM  Yeah. Yeah. 

00:11:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Coming here today with Judy and Mahaelani uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA seems to show the, the sense of connection you have with family. 

00:11:50
BRYAN KIM Yeah, and really that's the reason why I'm here because I know, that the stresses that are affecting me are also affecting them. And then, uhm, I wanna do something about it. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA (inaudible ) little girl. 

00:12:02
BRYAN KIM Mahealani. 

00:12:02
MICHEAL D'ANDREA She is such a beautiful little girl. 

00:12:05
BRYAN KIM She is, isn't she? Yeah. 

00:12:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA So the family value is something that's really important to you as well. 

00:12:10
BRYAN KIM Very important and uhm, also ah, it's very important for me to, you know, take care my parents when they, as they get older so uhm, not only my immediate family but my extended family is very important as well. 

00:12:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA So that's another source of responsibility that you have. 

00:12:25
BRYAN KIM Yeah, it is, it is. Yeah. But it's something that I'm, I know, that uhm, it's, it's, that's an important responsibility for me to carry out, yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA The other two values had to do with humility and collectivism. Humility of humbleness. 

00:12:35
BRYAN KIM  Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And collectivism rather than standing out as an individual as being ah, a member of a group and that was important. 

00:12:45
BRYAN KIM Yeah, it's sort of ah, you know, I've been sort of raised to just kind of be with the group and, and not really stand out and talk about my accomplishments and somethings that I'm you know, good at, you know, I tend to downplay those if I can... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
BRYAN KIM ...and really just be a part of the group and, and, and really think about, how my behavior and my actions are gonna affect other people in my group... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
BRYAN KIM ...and so that's that collectivistic... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
BRYAN KIM ...thing, yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  Well, this has really been helpful to me, Bryan because it seems like, your values and the sense of who you are are really connected to bein' Korean and American. 

00:13:25
BRYAN KIM Yeah, yeah, I, that's, that's a really good point I, you know, I think, I tend to be very Korean in my value orientation... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
BRYAN KIM ...but behaviourally(ph), I'm very American, you know, I been, I spent in almost 20 years here in United States so, uhm, you know, I can act, I can speak English pretty well, I think, and I can act and do things like any other Americans but value wise, you know, in my heart I know that I'm a Korean and so, I think, I'm pretty ah, I have a pretty strong sense of Korean essence(ph). So, (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

00:13:57
MICHEAL D'ANDREA But you have a balance with the American part of you as well. 

00:14:00
BRYAN KIM Sure, yes. Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Well, this is helpful to me to understand you a little bit more and your connection with Judy and your family. 

00:14:05
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And maybe, we can talk now, a little bit about some of the things that brought you here, to today's session. 

00:14:10
BRYAN KIM  Yeah, sure. Thank you. 

00:14:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  We've just taken a few moments, in the early part of our initial counseling session to touch base with Bryan about his cultural values. In the process, I was intentionally assessing his own cultural identity and try to verify not just by going over the six Korean values that researchers have talked about but checking with Bryan ah, on how much the values fit his own sense of himself and his identity. Now, we wanna begin to demonstrate how we would moved in to exploring the problems situation that brought Bryan and Judy here to the counseling session. But first, I'd like to incorporate Judy into the ah, marriage disc(ph), ah, counseling process right now. So we pick it up from this point. Judy, we spent a lot of time talking to Bryan and getting to know him and you've been a little bit busy with Mahealani and, and I want, wanted to check with you and see if you had any comments before we kinda move forward with ah, things that Bryan has said about his values and how you see uhm, Bryan living out his values? 

00:15:20
JUDY DANIELS Well, I think, you know, as we had talked about ah, that Bryan's been keeping a lot of feelings inside and ah, that's caused a lot of stress and it's coming out in terms of somatic bodily types things. 

00:15:35
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
JUDY DANIELS And so ah, I think, that one of the things that's gonna be important is for us to, to really get at some of those emotional feelings and, and get some of those, some of those feelings out. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
JUDY DANIELS You know, as I've mention before we had a lot of stress going on... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:15:50
JUDY DANIELS ...and ah, and I think that that's, that's gonna be important for us as a family... (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:15:55
JUDY DANIELS ...to deal with some of those emotions. (crosstalk) 

00:15:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. So that's a little bit different though Judy than, than, you feel that maybe would be useful for Bryan to get somebody's emotions...(crosstalk) 

00:16:00
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and Bryan said it was kind of important for him to keep the emotions in, in, in check that... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...that was something he really values so, we're, we're, we're gonna be looking at and, and talking together and see how we can work together in, in, in trying to resolve that, that difference... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
JUDY DANIELS Okay. 

00:16:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...that the two of you seem to have but... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  I wanted to find out a little bit more about the feelings that you think Bryan has and Bryan, what exactly brought you to this session today? You mentioned that your doctor helped make a referral? 

00:16:30
BRYAN KIM  Yeah, uhm, you know, I've been having a lot of lower back pains, and lot of headaches, you know, gastrointestinal problems and uhm, I got a physical exam and everything check out fine. And so, they really felt ah, there's nothing physically, wrong with me. And you know, so my doctor thought it maybe psychological and must admit there has been a lot of stresses that I've been uhm, trying to deal with uhm, you know, stresses at work and that is heavy research demand uhm, pressure of publication. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
BRYAN KIM Uhm, as well as pressures from family you know, my parents are becoming older and I feel responsible too. Uhm, you know, start taking care of them better... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:17:10
BRYAN KIM ...and so, uhm, you know, stresses from different arenas have just kind of affected me and, I think, you know, Judy does have a good point about my, you know, maybe not expressing emotion, I'm not, I can't easy, easily talk about what I'm, what I'm, experiencing but to really express the emotions is, is a bit uncomfortable for me, uhm, but for the sake of my family if that's what it takes me with us, something... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
JUDY DANIELS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
BRYAN KIM ...that I need to learn to do. 

00:17:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA So your strength is really to, kinda talk about your feelings without overly expressing them in emotional way... (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and, and when you talk about your feelings as your doing right now, you mentioned stress with your parents growing older... (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
BRYAN KIM Uh-huh. 

00:17:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...uhm, as an engineer and, and you have a lot of demands at work... (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
BRYAN KIM Uh-huh. 

00:17:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and you put many hours and you said after work... (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
BRYAN KIM Uh-huh. 

00:17:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and then having a new baby and, and trying to work ah, ah, you, have your marriage work out with this new baby. A lot of stress going on. 

00:18:05
BRYAN KIM Yeah, your right. Yeah. Just uhm, a lot of different things from me to deal with. Yeah. 

00:18:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And when Bryan talks about his feelings as he's doing now Judy, is that something that he does at home or? 

00:18:15
JUDY DANIELS Yeah, we talked about, you know, how things are going and some of the stresses ah, that both of us are experiencing. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
JUDY DANIELS So, uhm, so I mean, we talked about it but I think, you know, my point was that he, he doesn't really get a lot, I mean, it, it sort of tends to be a little monotony doesn't really get a lot of those feelings out and I think, then they come out, you know, physically... (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
JUDY DANIELS ...for him 'coz he sort of, he may talk about it but he just keeps a lot of the real feelings in. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. So when the doctor said that you had a clean bill of health with all the test that went on, what did you think about that? 

00:18:50
BRYAN KIM Well, I'm surprised, you know, because, you know, I'm not afraid that there's gotta be something physical, physically wrong with me. Uhm, so when he suggest that you know, going for a counseling, I thought, "No, I don't like counseling." You know, I mean that's the last thing that I thought might need... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
BRYAN KIM ...uhm, and as I mentioned earlier you know, I do feel bit embarrassed that I need to come here 'coz I think I need, you know, I should be able to take care of all my stresses in my own, you know, without having to affect other people... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
BRYAN KIM ...and, but I know that it's affecting Mahealani and Judy uhm, well, yeah, I do try to hold that in. Uhm. 

00:19:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Maybe, how about, if I hold her for a second. I wonder if we could take a few minutes to talk a little bit about some of the stresses that you experienced and some of the things that you do that you feel good... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
BRYAN KIM Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  about dealing with the stresses and Judy, you would be really helpful in, in talking about this. 

00:19:45
BRYAN KIM Yeah. 

00:19:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Well, in summary, you can see some of the complexity that's involved in conducting a marriage counseling session with a young child ah, ah, ah, ah, a man who comes from a different racial cultural bo, group than the therapist and a female. There are multiple factors involved. We begin this process by emphasizing the cultural strengths and trying to demonstrate a level of respect that is not typically communicated in many psychotherapeutic in counseling sessions. The primary purpose of taking a more instructive role was to demonstrate to the client our sense of heighten respect and awareness of the potential differences that may exist between the therapist and the client. And secondly, we moved in to looking at the problem identification, what was the primary reason that Bryan was referred to this session and begin to look at some of the issues, the specific issues that we may wanna work on in future sessions. At the very end, we tried to conclude by talking to Bryan about looking at and exploring some of the stresses that went on in his life and emphasize the effective strategies that he use to deal with those stresses. Hopefully, in using these sort of multi-cultural competencies it would enhance positive therapeutic alliance with in, with individuals who come from different cultural and racial backgrounds. 

00:21:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  This has been a very exciting demonstration, I don't, that(ph) maybe exciting as to pick a word to capture it but, you know, we've been talking about this theories as being innovative approaches and I think what you did was provide us with some innovation ah, because this is not typical as far as how we train counselors to do counseling. 

00:21:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
 Hmm. 

00:21:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Ah, I just wondered if ah, we could explore the next few minutes just a couple of the dynamics and ask you a couple of questions. Certainly, we won't have the time to get to all of the factors and process that we went through but ah, we're just to say it was excellent. Uhm, I guess my, a couple of my questions to begin with from the competency prospective, where we talk about awareness, knowledge and skills to do this kind of work uhm, from your point of view as the clients ah, what were the competencies that you felt the therapist, Michael, was able to ah, use in this session? Could you identify a competency or two that worked for you. Judy, you wanna go first? 

00:22:25
JUDY DANIELS Yeah, uhm, I think one of the strengths was ah, Michael exploring Bryan's cultural background. So, his ah, his skill at bringing out some of the different values, I thought was, was, was really quite good and he's acknowledging that ah, he has an awareness of this, he has knowledge and then to skillfully and artfully bring those out in the context of this session, I thought, I thought was good and also inviting Bryan to participate and to uhm, make any kind of additions or changes ah, in terms of how it fits with him, I thought was, I thought was a nice piece. 

00:23:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. Bryan, what do you think? (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
BRYAN KIM Yeah, I really noticed the cultural sensitivity uhm, that Michael is demonstrating... (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
BRYAN KIM ...you know, in his awareness and knowledge and the skills and it really helping you to process some of the cultural values that I was... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Hmm, uh hmm. 

00:23:15
BRYAN KIM ...experiencing and uhm, and I think, really showing that you know, that he wants learn and also... (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
BRYAN KIM ...that really, I felt nice and I felt liberated, actually. (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Good, (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
BRYAN KIM Yeah. 

00:23:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  good. And that is a very important piece, the learning piece in all of these experiences because we, as counselors ah, instructors don't have all the answers anyway. Allen, you had a couple... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. Ah. 

00:23:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...of questions, too. 

00:23:35
ALLEN IVEY This would, I'd be interested in your response to this, I mean, first of all, I say, I was touched and impressed by the sharing of self-involvement alleged in the beginning and I think that structuring is really critical, I think it's a wonderful demonstration of that. The same time, I know that my ah, women students in my classes as they watch this tape. I can feel them starting to tense and so forth. Ah, the reason being is that the focus, it kind of some, from one perspective looks like an exercise frankly in male power. 

00:24:05
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
ALLEN IVEY  Ah, and ah, Judy has got two men and the main discussion was between the men and I wonder how the three of you respond to that? 

00:24:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Well, from a cultural perspective if we look at the Asian values, the hierarchy and the way to start family counseling sessions requires that the therapist address the male first in the family. Now, you're taking a risk here because without knowing the level of identity development with the client, you might err in terms of a more Egalitarian philosophy that the couple might share. But that was a risk that I took in, in this particular situation seeing that Bryan's identity with the Korean culture matched might be appropriate to do in this setting. 

00:24:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. What do you think, Judy, about that Allen's question of, did it feel two male dominated? 

00:25:00
JUDY DANIELS I think it was two male dominated in the sense that again, I think ah, Michael was really trying to ah, honor Bryan's cultural background and experiences... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
JUDY DANIELS ...uhm, and I think as this, if the session had unfolded even more, you know, he would have started to draw me in more in that context. So I think he as really trying... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
JUDY DANIELS ...to honor that ah, that perspective. 

00:25:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
ALLEN IVEY So, the thing you're suggesting in a, in a gender ah, the interface of culture and gender go with culture first as kind of ah, a background and then bring in the gender issues a little bit later? 

00:25:35
MICHAEL D'ANDREA  Essentially, since Bryan was the person who was referred for counseling... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...it would be a different dynamic if... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
MICHAEL D'ANDREA ...Judy had been the primary referral, I think. So there's a number of considerations that take into mind. 

00:25:50
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah. And I think that, that that's a very good point. Two other things that occurred to me are the acculturation... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...factor... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...and the Egalitarian factor because both, this is a quilt(ph) professional couple, (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:26:00
PATRICIA ARREDONDO so, at the same time uhm, the cultural values as you indicated uhm, from the point of view of physically there's nothing wrong, so we know that there's another kind of dynamic, psychological dynamic... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
MICHAEL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...and, and that you were sensitive to know that cultural values... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...will probably playing into that as well. So that, that's the... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:26:25
PATRICIA ARREDONDO ...other piece we often have to look at. (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
ALLEN IVEY And there's always more things to look at ah, first, ah, and I think we're gonna have to wind up to this point and leave lots of questions unanswered.
