University of Wales College, Newport UWCN Coleg Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd Gerard Egan in conversation with Frank Wills a programme from the School of Social Studies 

00:00:35
FRANK WILLS Hello, my name is Frank Wills and I teach on the postgraduate program in counseling here at the University of Wales College, Newport. Gerard Egan in his book The Skilled Helper first published in 1975 had a very big impact on the development of counseling in the United Kingdom. What he offered was a fertile fusion of, on the one hand, supportive client centre counseling in tradition of Carl Rogers and on the other, a more outcome and action orientated approach from the behavioral tradition. One very useful aspect of this fusion, was the fact that Gerry was able to distinguish different stages in the helping process and to tie the use of specific skills to those stages. Many people found this to be a very helpful template for the teaching and learning of counseling skills. The Skilled Helper is now gone to seven editions. It’s been translated into many different languages and is a world bestseller in its field. Gerry has expanded the model and assembled an impressive array of research to back up many of his points, he's managed to keep pace with the fast shifting American counseling scene. Many of whose developments influence counseling in this country as well. This interview offers a chance to explore his original ideas and their development. In his writing, Gerry does not say much about himself, but inevitably, we here have the chance to experience how his ideas fit with him as a person. Okay, so let’s have a look at the video. Okay, Gerry welcome to Wales and it’s a really great pleasure to have you here today and to have a chance to explore some of the aspects of your famous Skilled Helper model with you. 

00:02:30
GERARD EGAN Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:30
FRANK WILLS As I was saying to you earlier you know that the model has features on the curriculum here for getting on for 20 years now. So we've had a lot of students who've been thinking, writing, talking, discussing various points and what I've tried to do today is to ah, make a brief note of some of the points that have come up and, and get a chance to ah, explore… 

00:02:55
GERARD EGAN Many years, yes well… 

00:02:55
FRANK WILLS …some with you later. 

00:02:55
GERARD EGAN That’s good news and bad news, 20 years older. 

00:03:00
FRANK WILLS Indeed we are, yes. Okay. Well, I guess while we are on the theme of development as it were, ah I wondered if you can say a little bit about you know, your own personal and professional background. That ah, that you know may, may impact in someway on, on the, the model. I'm interested in you know, the idea that you came, you come from the priesthood and you were involved in ah, the Loyola University. Ah, and I know by the way, I one, one of my readings of, of that and religious tradition was an emphasis on action which I thought was interesting according to the… 

00:03:40
GERARD EGAN Yes… 

00:03:45
FRANK WILLS …that I read. And I'm also interested in the type of projects that you know, you've been involved in over the years, which seem to have a quite a wide range ah, of different sort of urban and other projects. 

00:03:55
GERARD EGAN Yes, well my whole career, I think has been based on the saying yes the things that I thought were a little bit beyond me in finding out that ah, they weren’t basically and then looking for the next challenge etc. I suppose with respect to my background I am ah, I suppose a helper at heart and priesthood, it’s something to do with that. Ah, trying to do something about the human condition and it’s still ah, one of my primary personal focuses if you want. Ah, the Loyola bit(ph), the Loyola is a Jesuit university and so I'm Jesuit born and bred and trained etc. And ah, I was a Jesuit seminarian for a while but ah, ah didn’t go on in that. Ah, so yes and then, I, I think that part of it, I think as a Jesuit seminarian I learned how to think clearly. Hopefully that still persist and I’m still trying to think clearly about things and about the basics of life I suppose and the basics of life ah, ah you know those are still all of my interests so. 

00:05:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, that leads us onto the, the ah second part of this about the, the actual projects that you ah, have been involved in. 

00:05:20
GERARD EGAN Well, I, I moved from ah, counseling really into two areas at consulting, because some of the models that I have developed also have business implications or more widely than business organizational ah, implications whether the organization is a church or a counseling centre or BP or whatever. Ah, and so my ah, I suppose my interests have gone broad figuratively and literally. So I wanted the world both as a, ah in, in terms of The Skilled Helper work in counseling and I wanted the world also in helping people in terms of their organizations, business and whatever. Ah, so ah obviously it was not a career that was designed from the beginning. 

00:06:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:06:20
GERARD EGAN And ah, once I’ve found something new more interesting and more challenging and so on and so forth, but everything that I had learned up to that point I brought with me so the communication process is the helping process it’s the change processes all figured and do figure strongly in the type of ah, consulting that I've done with the various, various organizations. 

00:06:40
FRANK WILLS I was, I was thinking particularly actually of ah, maybe the earlier ah, stage of your, your work ah, partly because that it seems to me that you may have used that to give ah, a lots of the examples in The Skilled Helper, you know of individual clients in, in particular. 

00:07:00
GERARD EGAN Yes. 

00:07:00
FRANK WILLS And ah they, they have quite a sort of urban feel to them and I'm interested, coz I, I'm correct to say that Loyola is in Chicago… 

00:07:10
GERARD EGAN Yes, yes. 

00:07:10
FRANK WILLS And so, there's quite a strong tradition there of, of urban sociology… 

00:07:10
GERARD EGAN Yes, the university projects itself of being… 

00:07:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:07:15
GERARD EGAN In, in the centre of things in Chicago etc. Ah, I've never thought of this from the viewpoint of being urban. Yes, I am urban I like cities, in fact around the world most people seem to be gravitating toward the cities anyway. Ah, most of the world's population ends up one way or another in, in urban settings. So I guess, I'm part of that movement and so it does yes, rural and ah, it’s not been a part of my background or development. I enjoy getting away from things and people and cities, but then all of a sudden I find in me a thirst to get back. 

00:07:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:07:55
GERARD EGAN Because that’s where, I don’t know people or the action is(ph) whatever. I remember being in Britain one time and I, I worked ah, I was doing a sabbatical and working for Vanderbilt University that had a counseling program here for the US Air Force I believe and I worked in that and the, and it was located, I lived in Woodstock and was located at upper Heyford, but every once in a while I needed to fix ahead to get to London. 

00:08:25
FRANK WILLS And it’s and it struck me too that some of the clients sound, sound like they have come from quite tough background, you know you’ve mentioned… 

00:08:35
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:08:35
FRANK WILLS …alcohol drug programs something like that… 

00:08:35
GERARD EGAN Oh yeah, yeah well it's, when I grew up that didn’t seem to be a problem at all and all of a sudden that’s a huge problem around the world and ah, and finding its way into in the United States at least finding its way into rural settings, small town settings, rural settings… 

00:08:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:50
GERARD EGAN Just as bad as it is in the… 

00:08:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:50
GERARD EGAN …big cities so it’s an issue. 

00:08:55
FRANK WILLS Correct. And, and that that’s certainly true in south, South Wales as well. 

00:09:00
GERARD EGAN Yeah, cities I suppose can be urban, can be urbane(ph) and they can be tough as you say… 

00:09:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah… 

00:09:05
GERARD EGAN And ah, and that’s true I believe that the (inaudible ) parts of the cities around the world and there are tough parts of cities around the world. 

00:09:15
FRANK WILLS Okay, so I'd like to just share a few thoughts actually about ah, how the ah how I think the, the Skilled Helper had such a big impact in the UK… 

00:09:25
GERARD EGAN Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:25
FRANK WILLS And ah, I, also quite surprised to learn earlier that you didn’t know about the radio series in the late 70s, which was based to call the principles of counseling and actually you know was, was based a lot around your model. 

00:09:35
GERARD EGAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:35
FRANK WILLS And, and I think one of the things that ah, particularly appeal to people that certainly appeal to me very strongly and I know two(ph) other people that I worked with, ah was the, the fusion and the integration if you like that you achieve between on the one hand the kind of ah, the person centered Rogerian type of counseling, but also more action focused and behavioral model and that you actually brought those principles together in a very caring(ph) way. 

00:10:05
GERARD EGAN Yeah I, I think that they can really exists part(ph) Carl Rogers was a genius in his approach to the, the kind of relationship building and communication skill part of the, the helping process and I was always and well, I, I was fascinated by his work from the beginning. I met him a couple of times but only in larger gatherings. (inaudible ) …beginning things and he was… 

00:10:35
[sil.] 

00:10:40
GERARD EGAN …that the kind of ah, what skill sets does a helper need and what about the humanity of the helper. The humanity of the helper obviously deals with his or her relational abilities and the skill set deals with ah, you know they call it the Egan model it’s not really, it’s my version of the model that exists that I think is one of those universals. Wherever I go I find people interested in managing the problem situations of life. 

00:11:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:11:10
GERARD EGAN And identifying and developing the opportunities of life and that's a cogn… that is of it’s very essence cognitive behavioral in nature and then how I go about it the, the kind of, the kind of myself as a relater and a communicator is part of that package. So, ah I can’t see any helping ah, worth it’s medal(ph) that isn’t part of that package to tell you the truth. 

00:11:40
FRANK WILLS Okay, so I want to come back to the action, the behavior in just a second. But something you said just reminds me of another point that was floating around somewhere in my mind and ah that is the, the point that you make about the different cultures and, and I actually overheard one, two people debating your model once I’m at(ph) some meeting I was asked. 

00:12:05
GERARD EGAN Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:05
FRANK WILLS And one person was saying well the thing is it’s very American very culturally based around American achievement values etc, etc. And then the, the other person who actually had quite a lot of international students on her… 

00:12:20
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:12:20
FRANK WILLS …course said well, what we find is that actually ah, the international students identify much more with this, because you know, it doesn't have very strong ah, ah ideological… 

00:12:30
GERARD EGAN Yes. 

00:12:30
FRANK WILLS …elements. 

00:12:30
GERARD EGAN On the school affiliations it doesn’t have any(ph) school affiliations. 

00:12:35
FRANK WILLS And therefore this is what puts off you know, lots of people say from Africa. We find that incomprehensible, you know. 

00:12:40
GERARD EGAN That’s in keeping with the kind of marketing and sales division of Thomson International, who now owns The Skilled Helper has the copyright to it. Ah, twice as many books currently are sold outside the United States than in the United States it’s still a decent seller in the United States, but ah, so it seems to be in keeping with what you're saying. 

00:13:00
FRANK WILLS And would that be true about continents as well those (inaudible ) sell in Asia and Africa. 

00:13:06
GERARD EGAN Oh yeah, oh yes, it’s been translated into Japanese and four different times into Chinese I’ve found out. 

00:13:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:13:10
GERARD EGAN Ah, and ah you know, I, wherever I go and I've been all over the place Fiji, South Africa ah, Tanzania you name it and ah, people it seems around the world somehow rather end up trying to grapple with the problem situations of their lives and develop being the resources and the opportunities of their life. That is the universal and I think that a kind of problem management approach I don’t say solving, because that’s ah, too limiting but problem people managed the problems of their lives is a, is a universal phenomenon and there are something about people cognitive they, that they respond to kind of frameworks then enable them to do that little bit more effectively. The framework has existed forever, ah The Skilled Helper is my version… 

00:14:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:14:10
GERARD EGAN …if you want… 

00:14:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:14:10
GERARD EGAN …of that particular framework, which I think is cognitive universal to tell you the truth. 

00:14:15
FRANK WILLS Ah, yes, I think one of the early you, you (inaudible ) a fairly ancient source for a three stage, ah no understand and act or something. 

00:14:25
GERARD EGAN Yes, well I mean that that sort of stuff has been, been around for a long-long time and I think you find the basics of model probably in Aristotle if not in Plato, but anyway ah, I'm just capitalizing on what seems to be a fully human endeavor in the first place. 

00:14:45
FRANK WILLS Okay, so let me just pick up one particular elements of it which I think you know is a striking element of, of the model in, in all it’s you know evolutions ah, as far as I can see. And that is there is quite a strong emphasis on action getting people to change their behavior. Ah, or helping them to change their behavior to make, to make a ah a real impact on their lives. And it’s certainly one review in the UK ah, whilst ah, you know applauding that general sentiment also gently questioned whether there was perhaps sometimes what he referred to as a an impatience within act… in action. 

00:15:30
GERARD EGAN Well, it depends on what you mean by impatience and it depends on what you mean by inaction. Ah, first of all let me say action can, there are two forms of action that I talk about. Action that takes place inside, because we act inside ourselves and not just outside and then behavior outside of ourselves. So for instance, if I'm not type of person that keeps ruminating about the upfronts(ph) that I find that that I experience in daily life and I keep ruminating about that. There is an action that’s going on I can stop it actually. So there's a lot of nonsense that goes on inside of our heads at times and stopping some of that and substituting it with a more effective or more useful or more developmental or more opportunity focused types of thinking seems to be one set of actions even though they're internal actions. And then there is obviously the consequences of the changed of my internal mindsets that would have behavioral consequences outside. So, ah I simply never apologize for being action oriented. Ah, some people say it’s because I'm American basically, my parents were born in Ireland and I don’t know if Irish are overly committed to action or not. And became the Celtic tigers and things like that in the so-called new economy, but ah I don’t think that’s, that’s it at all. I think eventually people have to act on their own behalf and internally and externally. And if I can help them do with that get on that route(ph), ah as it were, ah I feel that I am being useful. 

00:17:30
FRANK WILLS Ah, I'm thinking of you know some ah, some of the comments that you know, some students have made as they get too close(ph) to this model and um, we always feel that it’s, it’s helpful to get people to stay at their reservations and… 

00:17:40
GERARD EGAN Hmm…Hmm… Good, yeah. 

00:17:40
FRANK WILLS …because that's what the, that’s what education I guess is about. And the type of thing that might come up on this theme might be something like that ah, for example with a client who is grieving(ph) and you know, and ah that they may need to spend sometime where they are feeling quite low and not particularly trying to move on. 

00:18:05
GERARD EGAN Well, grieving(ph) is an interesting… 

00:18:05
FRANK WILLS You know, that it has (inaudible ) of timing I think, you know. 

00:18:10
GERARD EGAN Well, first of all there are probably major differences in within the ways in which people even in the same culture go (inaudible ) about grieving(ph). Ah and that’s why I, what I try to do is stay in touch with the research that’s going on in that and grieving(ph) is an interesting one, because I read some research ah, recently on the myths that are associated with grieving(ph) that grieving(ph) is necessity a long drawn out process etc, etc, etc. Ah, and the research show that that’s not necessarily true at all and that ah, that that becomes instead of part of the healing it becomes part of the problem. 

00:19:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:19:00
GERARD EGAN You know, I'm obviously in the setting we cant go into the details of that but ah when, we are in the social sciences, the social science is well in earlier built a great deal of speculation. 

00:19:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:15
GERARD EGAN And so when I find people over and over speculate about things. And I think it's impossible not to speculate about things, but to the degree that its possible I think that we should ask ourselves what type of research supports, the type of speculations that we engage in. And ah, in fact the very reason that I use a problem management opportunity development model it seems to be one of the most researched if you want models that there is in within psychology. And ah, so I, I turned(ph) the choices that I've made in the various editions of The Skilled Helper I've tried to base them on whatever type of sound social research. Some people would even say there is no such thing as sound social research. Ah, but that that I can find and I suppose a lot of it has to do with my own instincts that reading and trying to work my training(ph) through that research. Ah, should I be pushing people into things that they don’t want to do or can people be pushed prematurely into actions they shouldn't take, yes, but there should be commonsense. I, I don’t think we can set up principles. Eventually, people have to act on their own behalf if they want. Put it this way is or is not counseling about change? 

00:20:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:40
GERARD EGAN To me it seemed to be about a person changing in some way or another. And I think the sooner that the person can get on that road, other things being equal… 

00:20:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:20:50
GERARD EGAN …they’ll better… 

00:20:55
FRANK WILLS I, I agree with your, your points about ah, you know that people ah, I think grieve in very different ways and at different speeds and so forth and I was particularly interested in a research study which you quote in the seventh edition, I don’t know if you recall it the Atkinson, ah study and this was ah, where ah, I suspect it might have been on Myers Briggs study and they were talking about you know, thinkers and feelers. 

00:21:20
GERARD EGAN Yeah! Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:20
FRANK WILLS Saying there is a lot of counselors basically are feelers, but lot of clients I think are sometimes… 

00:21:25
GERARD EGAN Yeah, sure yes. 

00:21:25
FRANK WILLS There's a mismatch… 

00:21:25
GERARD EGAN Well that’s, that’s true. Ah, that I'm not sure whether your question might be then… 

00:21:35
FRANK WILLS Well, it would be quite, it is possible that thinkers and feelers grieve in different ways for example. 

00:21:40
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:21:40
FRANK WILLS You know that we have charted(ph)… 

00:21:40
GERARD EGAN Well, one there are no such thing as pure(ph) form(ph) thinkers and pure(ph) form(ph) feelers. And it’s true that people in the helping professions tend to gravitate more towards the ah, feeling dimension of the Myers Briggs, but there's still a mixed bag and ah, I suppose in the end maybe this is American, I'm trying to be pragmatic in the way in which I help people. Ah, because I feel guilty if I'm just with them and I'm not really helping them move some place. I mean, ah my assumption it is in their social life there should be the ideal as they're in a community of people whether the community is two or more than two, of people who are with them in their struggle. But if counselor, if all I'm doing is taking the place of somebody like that who is in their social network, then I'm not so sure that I'm doing anything different that would make a difference in their lives. So yes, that makes me more pragmatic more action oriented ah, ah because I do not see myself just as their friend. 

00:22:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm… So do you think you're saying something different than Rogers was saying in that respect then? 

00:23:05
GERARD EGAN Oh, I'm saying something quite different from what Rogers was saying ah… Rogers’ assumption basically was this that if you listen to and understand your clients helpful(ph) this will free up the resources enable them to move on by themselves and I don’t buy that at all. I don’t think that that’s true. That’s the if you want the cognitive behavioral part of things. 

00:23:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:23:30
GERARD EGAN Ah, he was a genius I think at what he did and but I see what Rogers was doing as a stage in the development of counseling therapy or whatever you want to call it. And ah, an extremely important stage. 

00:23:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:23:45
GERARD EGAN And I think the whole philosophy of being focused on the clients in his or her needs are absolutely essential and he did that amazingly well. Ah, but the whole idea that is are we supposed to stop there? 

00:24:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:24:05
GERARD EGAN I, I couldn't stop there. In conscience I couldn’t stop there. 

00:24:10
FRANK WILLS Of course one, one of the things is that that the field does move very quickly now, so a lot of ideas coming in all the time. 

00:24:15
GERARD EGAN Yes. 

00:24:15
FRANK WILLS And one really important idea which I noticed that you're putting into your more recent editions is the idea of positive psychology. 

00:24:25
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:24:25
FRANK WILLS I wonder if you could say something about that that and how you see that… 

00:24:30
GERARD EGAN Well… 

00:24:30
FRANK WILLS …fitting in. 

00:24:30
GERARD EGAN Yeah, basically I responded to the (inaudible ) and the kind of work that he is, and his associates are doing. Ah, he's introduced a point of view. This is the way I look at it. He's introduced a point of view that perhaps we as counselors or therapists if had some blind spots around. Ah, we can get so focused on the downside of things the problem situations that clients are struggling with. Ah, that we forget about things like resources, we forget about opportunities, ah I used to call The Skilled Helper a problem management model. Now, I've had problem management even before the Seligman(ph) stuff came out. I was talking about it's… unless we help clients seize the resources that they have in their lives, the resources that they have within themselves and the resources they have that are, that exist in the communities of, of which they're a part, they're not going to make the type of progress in managing the problem situations of their lives that they could. So it was a point of view that I think was under developed. 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:45
GERARD EGAN It’s always not so much new and nobody created positive psychology it was always there, but it was a point of view that was under valued under used under whatever you want to call it. And I thought that it was useful enough to add into the kind of ah, overall approach that I use in the Skilled Helper. 

00:26:05
FRANK WILLS And ah, ah you know you mentioned that that perhaps, ah that helpers themselves have blind spots and I think that’s another interesting… 

00:26:15
GERARD EGAN Yeah, everybody we all do, yes. 

00:26:15
FRANK WILLS …a notion you've brought into the world, you talked about the shadow side of helping as well. 

00:26:20
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:26:25
FRANK WILLS And ah, one, one particular point the interest may (inaudible ) I'm going to give myself indulgence of the point which particularly interests me here… 

00:26:30
GERARD EGAN Sure. 

00:26:30
FRANK WILLS …and, and that is the ah, ah, you make a point on… yeah, I think you made it one of the earlier models and I have kept it in throughout so it’s presumably a strong one in your mind and you're saying that when you're dealing with the issue of challenging clients… 

00:26:50
GERARD EGAN Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:50
FRANK WILLS …and you're saying that one of the things that sometimes inhibits ah, counselors is a kind of, a notion that the client is actually very fragile and if you challenge them they're going to fall apart. 

00:27:00
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:27:00
FRANK WILLS And you've quote some research suggesting this is not the case. 

00:27:05
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:27:05
FRANK WILLS And that that also interests me very much at that point. Can you, can you say a bit more about that? 

00:27:10
GERARD EGAN Well, ah yes ah, first of all I believe that the people can seize upon that and go around challenging people in ways that aren’t very helpful at all. That’s not the issue. The ideal is to help the clients challenge themselves. Ah, and I’ve found a variety of ways of, of talking with clients interacting with clients, so that I, I offer them opportunities to challenge themselves. If they don’t see some of these opportunities I might do it more directly. Ah, but ah challenge is a part of daily existence. I mean we, we face challenges it seems that the more I live with a more challenge that there seem to be both for myself and for the world around me. So the, the challenge is, is part of the human experience and I think that challenge and a lot of the, some of this came from Rogers. Rogers did not challenge people. He began to do so at the end of his career. It’s very interesting he has that delightful example, where you know, when he's talking about he's with a client he’s(ph) extremely boring and he falls asleep during the clients and it ends up kind of challenging him for being so boring. Ah, not(ph) that that is the ideal example so that ah, ah he himself since his theory suggests that you're not supposed to be challenging people how to find ways around it. That the way I… 

00:28:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:28:45
GERARD EGAN …viewed some of the things that he was doing towards the end of his life. Ah, but I see challenge as a basically good human experience ah, ah it should happen in daily life. People should be open to challenge, use opportunities of things that other people say to them to engage in self-challenge and so on and so forth. So I, I don’t feel that I need to apologize for that. Ah, challenging people is not telling people what to do. Challenge people usually I'm challenging people to look at something more widely or look at the implications of their behavior. So you want to say, you want to you know that in American culture there are two things that bug me. It’s the kind of permissive society in which I live. Ah, which can be summarized in the principle "I can do whatever I want". But then another principle has emerged. But if I get into trouble then you should have to help, come and help me. 

00:29:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:55
GERARD EGAN And I'm saying I'm sorry, which one do you want? Ah… So that ah, if somebody wants to live permissibly in a permissive society, then I think, if I can help that person to explore the consequences of that behavior that I might be somewhat useful to that person. And it's challenge… challenge should be part of the (inaudible ). It’s not so much challenge is, how we do it, how we go about it, which is another whole area that I've tried to develop right from beginning in skilled helper. 

00:30:30
FRANK WILLS I think the ah, the example that you gave, which I think is a notable and memorable one, yeah, from Carl Rogers, essentially what he was doing there was using the skill of immediacy… 

00:30:40
GERARD EGAN Yes, right. 

00:30:40
FRANK WILLS …I'd rather say. 

00:30:40
GERARD EGAN Yes. 

00:30:40
FRANK WILLS Giving immediate feedback and again, it's something you've talked a lot about it, isn't it, immediacy? 

00:30:45
GERARD EGAN Yes, yes. Right, because I… Immediacy is really sharing my experience with the client, with the client, basically, if it’s deemed as helpful. In all of this I think ah, commonsense which is… somebody said a misnamed term, because you doesn’t have to comment at all. Commonsense can be evoked in, in the use of the skilled helper and all of these things. But I find sometimes is people facet… on some facet like the action facet or the… and then create something that I didn’t intend it also. Make it into something, as if it were an absolute or challenging and make that into something as an absolute. I said action is, I cannot change unless I act ah, challenge can be extremely useful for… for me at times, depending on how it's delivered and so on and so forth. I should really be learning how to challenge myself anyway. And all of this seems to me as part of the commonsense of life, but maybe it’s not that common. 

00:31:50
FRANK WILLS Okay, that’s great, thanks. I guess we should start to wind this up now. But ah… And I would like to do it by bringing ah, to the full um, to relatively recent changes within American counseling culture seen as, as I understand it. Ah… And to really perhaps to emphasize how you, how the skilled helper has been very much of a journey and has had to… 

00:32:20
GERARD EGAN Yes. 

00:32:20
FRANK WILLS …encompass a lot of new ideas. 

00:32:20
GERARD EGAN That’s a good way of building (inaudible ) journey. 

00:32:25
FRANK WILLS And you, you facets to ah, to of a scene to take in. And the, the two things are, first of all is the, the so called managed-care revolution, which I know has had a very big impact in some ah quarters. And the other one is I've forgotten. 

00:32:40
GERARD EGAN Oh, okay. Well the managed… 

00:32:45
FRANK WILLS So, we'll stop at the managed-care one… 

00:32:45
GERARD EGAN Well, the managed-care one is not part of the British society, because you have a different approach to healthcare than we do. 

00:32:50
FRANK WILLS But it is coming in a little bit actually. 

00:32:50
GERARD EGAN Well, I suppose so. Managed-care is about that we don’t have enough resources. 

00:32:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:32:55
GERARD EGAN In the United States, we'd spend a lot more money than you do on healthcare ah, and so we'd end up not having a same type of issues that you have. We have a different set of issues, because no matter which approach you take in healthcare ah, it’s impossible to do everything. I mean, the resources just don’t exist through. So it’s a recognition that resources are limited. Managed-care basically tries to look at, at its best, looks at outcomes. What are we trying to accomplish here? So as counselors or as psychotherapists, you have to come up with the plan, what are the outcomes that you are going to try to help this client achieve in order to manage, so that he or she can manage his or her life more effectively? That is nothing wrong with that. I've been pushing that right from the beginning. That is ah, the outcome-focused nature of counseling rather than the relational. The relationship as far as I'm concerned is a means to an end, to help people… a person live his or her life more effectively. So the managed-care people are really, I mean the way they go about it and, and the trade that… the socio-economic trade-offs and the political-offs aside, the way they go about that package of things, people can call into question all they want. But at the heart of what they're trying to do, is people cannot spend their lives in counseling. Therefore, counseling is usually a de facto, a time limited and so let’s get the most out of that. It's basically the principle behind it. And counseling, that avoids challenge, for instance, cannot get the most out of those sessions. The sessions I think have to be different if they're to make a difference in peoples' lives. Therefore, things that are not ordinarily a part of these like questioning assumptions, questioning patterns of behavior and things like that, I see as the normal course of the helping, what a helper does. 

00:35:15
FRANK WILLS And presumably that this applies mainly to fund it you know, from insurance? 

00:35:20
GERARD EGAN Yes, well that has changed. Ah… It has changed the, the profession. 

00:35:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:35:25
GERARD EGAN There are many, many, many more counselors I suppose now that work in managed-care settings. They're not paid directly by clients, they're paid by third party's insurance companies or government or whoever. Ah… And the number of people in private practice has gone down and so on and so forth. So it has changed the landscape. But another way in which the landscape, many more counselors are flooding into different areas of life, into business, into… certainly the healthcare professions. Ah… And in fact the promotion of health now is being built into the whole philosophy of what the counseling profession should be. So that… It seems that these are some of the ordinary, the urban flow that goes on in societies. The societies grow and develop and move and change. Ah… That’s part and parcel of the picture. Does it called disruption and dislodgement? Of course. 

00:36:25
FRANK WILLS I remembered what my second issue (inaudible ). It’s a very closely related one and that… that is on the length of therapy. 

00:36:35
GERARD EGAN The length of therapy! 

00:36:35
FRANK WILLS This seems to be managed-care you can say as part of a general impetus to… 

00:36:40
GERARD EGAN Yeah. 

00:36:40
FRANK WILLS …to get working quicker and the therapy therefore to be shorter. In the book you do the latest issue. You do give some quite specific ah, numbers of sessions and, and percentage of clients who you think will fit into that and percentage you think… 

00:36:55
GERARD EGAN Well… 

00:36:55
FRANK WILLS If I’m rightly saying, but you reckon about quarter of people probably need a bit more that… 

00:37:00
GERARD EGAN Well, I'm just quoting this as a research that has been done. I have, I haven’t done research myself. You know, it’s a tricky question you know how (inaudible ). It's like asking how long is a piece of string? Well, how long should a piece of string be? Part of the issues resources. We don’t have resources to keep people in counseling forever. Ah… I don’t think it's good for people, the shorter the better. I would rather see the, what takes place in the counseling kicks off something that’s taking place in the daily lives of people. Whether it's within their friendships or within their families or within their communities, within their churches, within the other social settings of life. I don’t think that counseling should be substituted for that. Ah… So I work around principles and then try to apply common sense to any given case rather than coming up with specific or overly specific guidelines for how long this therapy should or should not be. Ah… You know how long should waiting lines be in the national health, the NHS, you know. Ah… Nobody has answered that, nobody is about to answer that, it seems to me. Ah… So, I think that ah… both when it comes to the NHS and to counseling generally, if we did some more of the prevention work earlier on in life, which is another whole area or kind of (inaudible ) depending upon… 

00:38:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:38:45
GERARD EGAN …whole opportunity or (inaudible ) depending on how you look at it, are more important questions in how long shared therapy should be. Ah… 

00:38:55
FRANK WILLS It reminds me of a comment you make in the introduction to the seventh edition, ah… where you talk about yourself as a kid in school. 

00:39:05
GERARD EGAN Yes. 

00:39:05
FRANK WILLS Maybe that’ll be a good point to finish off this interview. 

00:39:05
GERARD EGAN Yeah! Well, yes! 

00:39:05
FRANK WILLS Would you like to just think about what you did and didn’t learn in school? 

00:39:10
GERARD EGAN Well I… I came to another realization after I wrote that. And ah… I grew up in a ah… the north side of Chicago, a pretty catholic type place, do(ph) you want. Ah… I realized that my parents didn’t raise me, I know that sounds terrible. They did of course, provided me all sorts of things. But in a sense the community raised me. 

00:39:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:45
GERARD EGAN So things focused on the school, which was a catholic primary school. It focused on the parish. Social life was there. And there were all sorts of beneficent influences. My friends were there and so on and so forth. I had no idea how a benign my rearing was. Ah… We got good and… We were poor, considered relatively poor, not by the world standard of poverty obviously, because we… we were well fed, decently clothed, excellent education, healthcare… whatever healthcare we needed was provided and so on and so forth. We got all the big things in life, all the big things in life for which I'm eternally grateful. But the community raised me. And ah, the community… We could go out… I didn’t have to be home at any particular time, which is, which seem (inaudible ) these days I suppose. Why? Because when we finished things we went out and had a piece, we went to a movie, me and my friends and then we came home at night. There were no drugs on the street. People weren’t being shot down and so on and so forth. So I lived in ah, basically it seems in retrospect to be a kind of wonderland that seems to have disappeared. Just because I get older I don’t wanna say the world is getting worse. So what can I say? It was ah… I think it’s a great thing to be raised by a community. With parents playing some lead roles in that process. 

00:41:25
FRANK WILLS When we (inaudible ) urbanness? 

00:41:26
GERARD EGAN Yes, well yes! 

00:41:30
FRANK WILLS Okay, well Gerry, thank you so much for coming today and to sharing your thoughts. I'm sure this will be, you know a very great value to the students and the staff here.

NARRATOR The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of the use of counseling skills and we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. And this series in common with our other materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we will have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what've got to offer.
