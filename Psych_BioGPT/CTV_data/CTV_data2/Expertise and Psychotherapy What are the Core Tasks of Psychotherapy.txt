Expertise and Psychotherapy: Core Tasks Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. International Center for Clinical Excellence 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:00
 Good morning everyone and welcome to, ah, this morning's dialogue on Expertise and Psychotherapy. We, ah, have the opportunity this morning to hear, ah, two leading experts on this topic, Don Meichenbaum and Scott Miller and, ah, we will, ah,-- Don has gonna get it started and then Scott will respond and we'll have these individuals, ah, respond to what each other has said and if there's some time, ah, later on we will open up the mikes to questions from the audience. So, ah, without any other hesitation, please join me in welcoming Don Meichenbaum and Scott Miller.

Expertise and Psychotherapy: Core Tasks Scott D. Miller, Ph.D. International Center for Clinical Excellence 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:40
DON MEICHENBAUM Well, good morning and welcome. Ah, thank you for coming and I commend you in your good judgment in being here. I, uhm, I want you to know that this is the third time that we've had this dialogue at the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference and I don't know why you're here when I'm here to hear Scott Miller, okay? And I'm going to leave him the last 10 minutes of this hour to respond. Now, you are in the presence of two people at this conference who are the major critics of everything else that's being presented and of every residential group that's out there. So, Jeff Zeig has decided to have us present at the inopportune time in the most faraway place that people could ever find, okay? So, I don't it is an accident that it is eight o'clock, who knows where we are, okay? Uhm, and anyone who has arrived at eight o'clock to hear us, I want you to know that this is a treatable disorder and there is most likely medication. You will concur? 

00:02:10
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:02:10
DON MEICHENBAUM Do you ever wonder why we're here in eight in the morning? 

00:02:10
SCOTT MILLER Not a si... 

00:02:10
DON MEICHENBAUM We should be at-- in the arena at four o'clock in the afternoon. 

00:02:20
SCOTT MILLER There you go. Hmm. 

00:02:20
DON MEICHENBAUM We wouldn't put it in the program but the two of us should be in the arena. Okay, so, uhm, I have, ah, two, two kinds of issues that I, I'd like to put before you fear consideration. I, uhm, have been involved, especially since I became Research Director of this Melissa Institute, uhm, by training various clinicians. Ah, I've been working with, ah, mental health workers who treat returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. I do training of clinicians in residential programs, train addiction counselors in Nova Scotia. So, ah,-- and I do a lot of supervision. And the interesting question for me being an honest broker is what is it that I should train to do it. You know, given the controversies in the field, what is it that do you think we know, you know, this is a period of time when there is Division 12 and others are calling for evidence-based interventions, or people on Division 24, I said, "Don't get so excited. There's always more than nonspecifics." And then you have people like Miller, Lambert and Duncan, and others who have been pioneers in, in challenging us to look for the heart and soul of behavior change and as you'll hear from Scott Miller-- and listen, Scott Miller is presenting this afternoon on, ah, the Evolution of Psychotherapy and Oxymoron. If you have not court Scott Miller's act and it is an act, okay, it is mandatory, okay? It really is. Ah, he is so good that I have invited him to present at the Melissa Institute Conference, ah, in May and to get an invitation from me, you gotta be good or come very cheap. 

00:04:30
SCOTT MILLER It was, it was the latter. 

00:04:30
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. No-- very gracious, very gracious. You'll hear, I mean, I do small studies over the course of my career. He, he has half the world working for him and, uhm, and, and, and really in his depth. So, one of the interesting questions that I'm going to address here has to do with, ah, what are the core tasks, you know, ah, what is it that characterizes expert therapist. So, ah, I am now in the generativity phase of my life so you will see when you go on the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference, ah, I put together 357 page handout, ah, you could download or access and there's a handout on two things that I'll draw to your attention. One has to do with, ah, what are the core tasks of psychotherapy, what is it that I'm training people to do that, I'll comment on. And the second-- the issue that I wanna raise is what's the future of psychotherapy using computer technology and I'm gonna took over the courses out, just mention some of the interesting projects that we're involved in. Ah, the Melissa Institute website, uhm, has now had this year alone 2 million hits, ah, in terms in giving away science and trying to improve the quality and care of, ah, therapy. Ah, I have been involved in-- I'll just, just enumerate the computer stuff in a whole variety of interesting projects in, ah, with returning soldiers and the like. Just sort of think about where the field is going, ah, they have now developed, ah, cellphone technology, the GPSs in for people who have substance abuse problems and every time these people go to their favorite watering holes, the phone rings and on it comes up, uhm, ah, messages or role playing activities and the like. They've now developed-- there are now 500,000 apps and I've listed many of these that are four different kinds of therapy procedures, uhm, ah, i-- it's not only for soldiers. There's a program called ReachOut.com which is for adolescence. Ah, they now are developing interactive cartoons for adolescence who are being cyberbullied, ah, having problems with parents and the like. I've spent the last month creating, ah, avatar joke book scripts on trying to teach people coping strategies. Ah, they are now creating, ah, ah, computer technology that when the elderly take medication, it will have a transmitter and people will be able to pick up whether the medication has been taken. They now have, ah, materials that have been developed with regard to smokers so that if you take a cigarette in your had, ah, y-- you will pick up a message that says, "Don, this is your lung speaking. I am pinker than ever. The level of nicotine, it--" so, I mean, this is like having a Jewish mother with you all the time. Uhm, so, I, I invite you to go to the website. Ah, go to the, ah, website and download all the, ah, various kinds of technologies that are being developed which will not replace psychotherapist. These are one of the all adjunctive tools and I'll be interested in, ah, Scotts comments on this because, ah, his, ah, programs on the OQ-45 and providing therapist with ongoing feedback of client engagement is one of the major contributions in the field. And, and that the fact that you could take this, ah,-- conduct these quick assessments immediately after the session and inform therapist as to how they can alter interventions in a way, ah, I think is a major contribution to the field and something that we all need to be cognizant of. So, that, that's why I pitch on that and it's interesting that when I looked at the meta-analysis on this, uhm, it turns out that internet therapy, ah, is about as effective as face-to-face. I know that people tend to self-disclose more on the computer than they do the face-to-face therapy. Uhm, I presented recently at the War Resiliency Program in San Antonio and all the people who, who are working in the military there are doing internet therapy by Skyping with soldiers and families all over the world. Uhm, 70, ah, percent of people in need of mental health, ah, do not receive it. Only 10% of people who have substance abuse problems, ah, receive treatment. So the notion of how this is going to change psychotherapy in the future is really quite fascinating and, uhm, uhm, we have here someone who has been a leader in that domain. Second point and I'll turn it over to Scott. You know, the field is really in an interesting, ah, position now, uhm, because on the one hand you have all these people calling for evidence-based interventions, you can't just do anything, and yet on the other hand, ah, when you look at these various meta-analyses, the work of Wampold and all of their colleagues in the area of addictions or in the area of, ah, psychotherapy when they compare the so-called evidence-based interventions versus bona fide, ah, comparison groups. These are groups that are intended to succeed. Ah, you, you know, the field of psychotherapy is filled with hype. I-- it's worst than that. It's filled with bullshit. And-- no, seriously-- and I, I, I love psychology and clinical psychology and I must confess that I get embarrassed when I see what some of my colleagues actually accept and that what they do in therapy. You know, and I go, "Oh co-- I mean, did you not go to graduate school? Did you not learn anything about, you know, how to be a critical consumer?" And, uhm, so, we're, we're caught in the midst of this dilemma, you know, to advocate for one procedure or not, you know, is it, is it the nonspecific. So, my, my stance is that there are some therapists who get really good results no matter what they use. There are some therapists who have a whole variety of skills and we know that the major skill that you need that accounts for seven times more the variance and outcome and anything else has to do with the quality and nature of the therapeutic alliance. Uhm, and, and therefore, one of the things that becomes kind of interesting is if you look at the proportion of variance and accounting outcome. You know, the specific techniques that you were hearing in these presentations only account for 15% of the outcome. You know, so the interesting question is what-- how do you get people to, to become more expert in these other domains and, and how do you establish and maintain and, as Scott has been a leader, monitor the quality and nature of the therapeutic alliance and moreover adjust your treatment in a culture general sensitive and developmentally sensitive fashion. So, I will enumerate it and will have more time to talk about what the core tasks are in terms of therapeutic alliance and how do you monitor it, and how do you address therapeutic-interfering behaviors the way in which you, uhm, ah, are sensitive to therapeutic ruptures and address those, how you do psycho-education, how you nurture hope in terms of collaborative goal setting, ah, the way in which you, ah, provide feedback using a case conceptualization model, ah, the way in which you, ah, then, ah, teach skills but not only teach skills the way in which you build in generalization the way you put people into, ah, self-attribution mode in terms of they'd be making sure they take credit the way in which you do follow up, uhm, the way in which you relapse prevention. So when you get to the paper you'll see that I even enumerated each of those and when we do training, we make sure our people are expert in doing each of those kinds of core task and we've now spelled out some detail, ah, the various kinds of elements, ah, as to how they could do that, what are the features. Ah, one of the things that we know about expert therapist is, ah, they never tell their client that they're an expert. They're always conveying to them, ah, that they're there to learn an Scott has some really great videos of, ah, therapists who are in that mode as I-- if you've been to one of my workshops. Thus far, one of the things I convey is that your most valuable tool is the art of questioning, you know, and I encourage, ah, clinicians to, ah, emulate that fine inquisitor of the TV personality Peter Falk playing the character Columbo. You'll remember him with his crummy raincoat and he's in front of an amusement and, ah, in fact, I, I try to train collisions on how to play gum. For some, this is not a difficult or a challenging role and it comes remarkably easy. So, having these tools, I think, is what makes therapy, ah, go and I'll be happy to come back and, ah, enumerate on all of this. Uhm, so the major reason that I'm here is to find out how I'm wrong in everything I just presented that Scott will point out so I, I always look forward to these kinds of, ah, feedback opportunities and, ah, we have nine scientists to check for the Melissa Institute invitation yet so he has to be a bit gracious in his response. 

00:14:15
SCOTT MILLER Thank you. All right. Let me have my welcome to a Don for this morning, ah, and being up so early. It's a real pleasure. This is the third time we've been together. 

00:14:25
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. 

00:14:25
SCOTT MILLER I think our relationship goes back at least a decade now. 

00:14:30
DON MEICHENBAUM Yes, it does. 

00:14:30
SCOTT MILLER Ah, it's we were riding back and forth, ah, in a car together to do a presentation. 

00:14:35
DON MEICHENBAUM Wait, wait, wait there. Okay. Wait, wait, wait there. Wait, wait. We're both presenting, I told you, I'll give him a few minutes, right? Uhm, so, we're, we're, we're both presenting-- I forgot this-- we're both presenting at the New England Educational Institute in Cape Cod, right? So, we're driving back and forth each day. So I tell him on the way what I'm gonna present and as we get there he goes, "It's all bullshit. None of it is true." "Really? I mean, okay." Next day, I saw him a little bit earlier and say what I'm gonna present, "Go home, Go somewhere. It's not worth it, okay." Okay, so, you-- I worked hard to present this material. You carry on what you say. 

00:15:30
The Evolution of Psychotherapy: So, what's happened? •Since the 1960's: •Number of treatment approaches grown from 60 to 400+; •10,000+ "how to" books published on psychotherapy; •145 manualized-treatments for 51 of the 297 possible diagnostic groups in DSM. Duncan, B., Miller, S., Wampold, B., & Hubble, M. (eds)(2009). The Heart and Soul of Change: Delivering What Works. Washington, D.C.: APA Miller, S.D., Hubble, M.A., Chow, D.L., & Seidel, J. A.

Mahwah, NJ: LEAPress. 2013 ANAHEIM DECEMBER 11-15 

00:15:30
SCOTT MILLER Well, I thing the interesting thing was they had a bigger crowd than I do, ah, a-- at his presentation. Uhm, so-- let me, let me just talk a little bit about core tasks, ah, - 

00:15:40
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. 

00:15:40
SCOTT MILLER - and I, and I have my slides up, ah, for, for just a moment, uhm, and talk about, ah, what's happened since the 1960s that we have had an explosion, a mushrooming and treatment approaches, as Don says, from 60 to over 400 now, uhm, and that they ha-- that doesn't seem to be, ah, that there doesn't seem to be any end to this. Ah, in-- this is probably a very conservative estimate, ah, the encyclopedia of psychotherapies is now four volumes. If you were in graduate school around the same time I was, you had Raymond Corsini's slim volume that was just one. So we also have 10,000 "how to" books that have been published on how to do psychotherapy and if I can just make an editorial comment here, ah, that would be that any field that needs 10,000 books to describe what it's doing does not know what it's doing. Ten thousand books, it's just amazing. One hundred forty-five manualized treatments for 51 of the 397 possible diagnoses, ah, in the DSM. From an outside position, it looks like we have been progressing. We have many more opportunities to be trained, to learn specific models, and to identify the problems that clients come in with. 

00:16:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Progress •In most studies of treatment conducted over the last 40 years, the average treated person is better off than 80% of the untreated sample •No difference in outcome between treatment approaches; •Taken together, comparative, component (dismantling), mediating variable, & aptitude by treatment studies all show that specific ingredients are NOT needed to achieve a good outcome. SCOTTDMILLER.COM International Center for Clinical Excellence Duncan, B., Miller S., Wampold, B., & Hubble, M. (eds)(2009). The Heart and Soul of Change: Delivering What Works. Washington, D.C.: APA Press. 

00:16:55
SCOTT MILLER And if you look at just the over all news here about, ah, those efforts, it's, it's relatively positive. That is most of the day, to say, that what we do works. The average treated person is better off than 80% of the untreated sample. This is referred to as the effect size. One more time, average treated person better 80% of the untreated sample. I did not say that we were successful with 80% of the people that we met. At the same time, virtually no difference in head-to-head comparisons of treatment models for any particular treatment condition that has, ah, the models have been applied to, no difference in outcome among approaches. Plus, if you take these models apart looking for specific ingredients, the so-- so-called healing ingredients, the ones that we pay to learn then you don't find any evidence that any specific ingredient is necessary. 

00:17:45
"Decades of psychotherapy research have failed to find a scintilla of evidence that any specific ingredient is necessary for therapeutic change." Ahn, H., & Wampold, B. (2001).

Mahwah, NJ: LEA, 204. 

00:17:50
SCOTT MILLER Here's what one of my other mentors, ah, has said about this, ah, his name is Bruce Wampold, I was fortunate enough to meet him in graduate school, our relationship sems-- stems all the way back to the early 1980s. He says decades, decades of psychotherapy research have failed to find a scintilla of evidence that any specific ingredient is necessary for therapeutic change. I have to say (inaudible ) are some very bold words, all right? That if there's not a scintilla of evidence and yet 100% of the training is about that, you have to learn the right way to move your fingers, language, or questions, etcetera, in order to make a change. The data say that simply not the case.

00:18:30
SCOTT MILLER So, what does make a difference? What does make a difference in treatment outcome? We'd all like to know. Uhm, in a recent study, ah, the following graph appeared looking at a variety of factors in an accumulative way over the last 30 or 40 years at the various elements that might make a difference. We're not getting sound out of this. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:00
 Sound better? Better now? 

00:19:05
SCOTT MILLER Better now. So take-- just take a look at the graph but let me just highlight, ah, this piece down here about what does make a difference. The difference is between treatments. If you, if you take a look less than-- the effect size is less than .20, we've got 300 different studies. In other words, the difference is negligible if it exist at all. When you compare models head-to-head, there are just-- is no difference. Now, some people take this to mean they don't need a model of practice. It can be a therapeutic anarchy, that's not what this data means. What it means is that you have lots of choices and you have to figure out what fits for you and is going to fit for your client. Have I made my point? So, when people hear this data, it sounds like we're saying, "Just throw out your models. It's-- they're all a bunch of crap anyway." I'm saying you do need to learn something, some way to structure the interaction with your client. The idea that one is better ano-- or another-- than another for a particular problem, there just is very little research evidence for that. Let's move the bar up and take a look at what does make a difference across various methods, alliance. Look at the effect sizes compared to the effect size differences between the models. By the way, look at adherence to protocol, the so-called evidence-based practice. Its adherence to protocol has a near null effect following the rules of particular model near null effect. Think how much time is spent getting us to follow those protocols, training protocols, rated competence of delivering those models also has a very, very small effect. What will make a difference with your clients? Look at the top, your alliance in effect size of .5, empathy in effect size of .6, goal consensus and collaboration which Don talked at length about in his presentation on PTSD, ah, yesterday, .72, simply talking over what is it that people want collaborating with them in effect size of .72. Positive regard and affirmation, .56; congruence and genuineness, .49. If you're looking for something to do in your work, I would suggest looking at those factors, all, as Don is saying, alliance, ah, related factors. 

00:21:10
•Baldwin et al. (2007): •Study of 331 consumers, 81 clinicians •Therapist variability in the alliance predicted outcome. •Consumer variability in the alliance unrelated to outcome. More Between Therapies Within Therapies Symptoms Therapist 1 Therapist 2 Therapist 3 Less Weaker Stronger Alliance SCOTTDMILLER.COM International Center for Clinical Excellence Baldwin, S., Wampold, B., & Imel, Z. (2007). Untangling the Alliance-Outcome Correlation. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 75(6), 842-852 

00:21:10
SCOTT MILLER And who's responsible for those factors? Baldwin did a study that I find really interesting largely because you just don't see wide results like this very often. He was looking at differences in outcome between clinicians. What Don mention he talked about that certain clinicians reliably perform better than others. What accounted for 97% of the variability in outcomes between clinicians? The alliance, in particular therapist's ability in that alliance. By contrast, variability in the client's connection to you accounted for 0% of the difference in outcome. Let me say that again. The alliance is not the client's job, it's not their job to connect with us, align with us, to collaborate with us. It's our job to figure out how to collaborate with them and when that breaks down, it's not that they're resistant, it's that we are at the edge of our current realm of reliable performance. We need to push beyond that edge, learn how to connect to that particular person. 

00:22:10
•Despite the evidence: •Training continues to emphasize model and technique; •Therapists firmly believe that the expertness of their techniques leads to successful outcomes; •The field as a whole is continuing to embrace the medical model. •Emphasis on so-called, "empirically supported treatments" or "evidence based practice." •Embracing the notion of diagnostic groups, treatment specificity. Eugster, S.L. & Wampold, B. (1996). Systematic effects of participants role on the evaluation of the psychotherapy session. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 64, 1020-1028. The Evolution of Psychotherapy: What are the "Core Tasks" of Therapy? 

00:22:10
SCOTT MILLER Despite this evidence and I think Don has highlighted this, ah, relatively well here, training continues to emphasize model and techniques and if you survey therapists and ask them how come you help that particular person, despite them saying in general the alliance is important they will point out that their technique was the curative element. It's strange, really, and the field, again, as Don pointed out with its emphasis on so-called evidence-based treatments, acts as if we are the equivalent of medicine. Penicillin for what else mental and emotional functioning. It has a specific ingredient and if you just do that then you're going to get better. 

00:22:45
The Evolution of Psychotherapy: What are the "Core Tasks" of Therapy? WRONG QUESTION! A New Question and Focus •What is the core task of psychotherapists? Engagement "...the most important determinant of outcome... [this] can be considered fact established by 40- plus years of research on psychotherapy." Miller, S.D., Hubble, M.A., Chow, D.L., & Seidel, J.A. (2013) The outcome of psychotherapy: yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Psychotherapy, 50, 88-97. Orlinsky et al. (2005). Process and outcome in psychotherapy. In M.J. Lambert (ed). The Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior change (5THed.). New York Willey. 2013 ANAHEIM DECEMBER 11-15 

00:22:45
SCOTT MILLER The question what are the core tasks of psychotherapy for me, from side and I think you're hinting at the same thing here, Don, for me, this is the wrong question. It's not about what are the core tasks of psychotherapy. The question really is - 

00:23:00
 What do you mean? 

00:23:00
SCOTT MILLER - what are, what are the core tasks of psychotherapists. It isn't an issue about the field in general. It's an issue about you and me and our ability uniquely to connect to that particular client. And the core task of us in the room with the client, me, with that particular client, is to engage them in some healing process. Engagement David Orlinsky, one of my mentors, another mentor of mine at the University of Chicago, he says engagement is the, listen to this, the most important determinant of outcome. This can be considered fact established by 40 plus years of research in psychotherapy. You don't hear researchers talking like this very often. The end of most research articles is, of course, more research needs to be done. He says no more research needs to be done on this. We know engagement is the number one process-related predictor of treatment outcome. 

00:23:55
Engagement Understand, Affirm, Be Congruent, Genuine, & Collaborative, Seek Consensus SCOTTDMILLER.COM International Center for Clinical Excellence 

00:23:55
SCOTT MILLER So, what can we do? What can we do as therapist? What is your core task? I would say the core tasks are to, one, affir-- ah, understand the people that we work with; two, affirm them; three, be congruent in our own person in the room with them; four, be genuine; five, be collaborative; and above all else, seek consensus with our clients. That should be the challenges I believe for each and everyone of us. The sad part is it's not sexy. It's not interesting. It's not, ah, it's not, ah, I think hyped up on steroids with the latest evidence about neuropsyche research. Uhm, it just is-- thanks. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:45
DON MEICHENBAUM Now you know why I'm here. 

00:24:45
SCOTT MILLER Right. 

00:24:50
DON MEICHENBAUM And, uhm, it's interesting if you go back to the original definitions of therapeutic alliance, is the ability of the therapist to, ah, collaborate with the client and pick out the golds of therapy and the second that the two of them agree on the pathways by which they should achieve that goal. And third, uhm, item in there by Hubble and another is that there is an affective bond be-- that's positive between the two. It's not that you like the client or the client likes you but that apropos of what we just mentioned they feer-- they feel understood, heard, respected, and the like, that you as a therapist are nonjudgmental, compassionate, respectful, and all of those kinds of characteristics that are critical. It's interesting to consider how would you operationalize engagement, okay? I mean, that, that's a really interesting issue. So, i-- if we had videotapes of patients in therapy and you wanted to develop some kind of observational coding system, ah, whereby, ah, we could enumerate, ah, yes, he's engaged, you're not. So there would be both verbal and nonverbal indicators of what we would call engagement. So the engagement might be, for instance, a, that they show up, ah, con-- consider the, the work by Hoyt, Michael Hoyt and his colleagues on brief therapy in, in terms of noting that, ah, the model number of therapy sessions in North America is one. Not only that the second model number of responses attendance is minus one. People go for an appointment and do not show up. By the fifth session, we have a whole book on Treatment Adherence. Up to 70% of patients drop out. Manage care does not have to worry. All they have to do is count, count on therapist not doing anything that's gonna keep patients engaged, okay? Ah, the, the second kind of thing that you might look at in engagement is now do they intent but they actually participate in therapy. So what is it mean to participate in therapy? It means that not only would they listen but they may offer certain kinds of comments. How do you know your patient is engaged? So my objective in therapy is to have my client take my voice with them. Okay. I'm trying to get them to engage in that process. So one of my favorite questions to ask clients is the following. I will say to clients, "Let me ask you something a bit different, a bit unusual. Do you ever find yourself out there in your day-to-day experience asking yourself the questions that we ask each other right here?" Okay. And I'm really conveying to my client that part of what we're doing here is engaging in a style of modeling thinking. I think that the mechanism of change and I've presented this in my two workshops and we'll do so tomorrow when I talk about spirituality, is that we are not only Homo Sapiens that we are Homo Narrans, that we are all story-tellers, and we as therapists get paid to listen to people's stories. That, that's what therapy is. It's not something really sexy or anything. People come in and they tell you stories and for those who were at my workshop on yang yesterday on anger, I told stories about what my kids did to me, you know, and, and therefore the key question is how does the therapist help the client understand those stories and change it. Uhm, my other big, ah, pitch on this is that, you know, I'm heavily involved in trauma work with returning soldiers and after, after various kinds of 9/11, Columbine, and so forth, and the thing that's really impressive is that in the aftermath of any traumatic event, 75% of people are impacted but they go on in evidence resilience. So my concern is what distinguishes the 25% who are stuck versus 75% who make it and you can read about that in the road map to resilience book and the, the like and one of the things that become kind of interesting is that they tell different stories. So, for me, what is engagement? Engagement means that over the course of therapy, not only do they attend, not only they're participating, not only they perhaps doing the homework or engaging personal experiments and the like, but they are actively changing the nature of their story and they're developing personal experiments, corrective emotional experiences that are gonna expose them to data that's going to unfreeze their beliefs about themselves and the like. So, I-- you know, I, I'll be very interested, you know, by saying if in-- Orlinsky is right that engagement is there, how would we operationally define engagement. So one of the things that I encourage people to do is to become exquisite listeners to how people tell stories. And, ah, one of the things that happens is I ascertain that my clients are engaged when they have certain kinds of words in their stories and the words that they have to have in their story are partial agency active transitive verbs, metacognitive verbs, they have to be able in an unsolicited fashion say, "You know, doc, I actually notice that was a high-risk situation. I actually caught myself," "You know, I-- you know, I interrupted the cycle," "You know, I actually took a time, I have a backup plan," and what I do is I encourage clinicians to take the big toe on their right foot and every time a client uses of these verbs, just go up and down once. Woop! Woop! Woop! And plot over the course of therapy this unintrusive measure. Not only do they have to have these verbs as part of their new story, they also have to bathe story with -re verbs. -Re verbs is a sign of engagement for me. Ah, I'll tell you what I'm doing, I'm reconnecting, I'm re-authoring, I'm restoring, I'm regaining, I'm reclaiming. Okay. And if you look at all of these manuals that are out there, okay, all of these-- specially near a trauma-- just circle every -re verb and if you go to road map to resilience I have pages of this, of, of, of what needs to go on. So, ah, I, I think Orlinsky is absolutely right. But I think where the research is needed is to ascertain how do we know that patients are engaged. Wha-- ho-- what would we see and then to look at what are the therapist doing that facilitates that engagement because some therapist are better at it than others. I could assure you that one thing that you want to do if you want engagement for your clients is for you, the therapist, to not be a surrogate frontal lobe for your client, okay? That is use the art of questioning. Play dumb, convey that you want to-- and then ask them how are things going. Is there anything I said or felt or didn't say? Is there anything I did or did not do that you found particularly helpful or unhelpful? Have the guts to ask your client how things are going. If you don't wanna use informal questions, go to heartandsoul.com and see the four-item scale that Scott and his colleagues have developed that would give you within two minutes how well you're doing, right? You know, and, and, and not only that, you can get it in 68 languages. 

00:32:30
SCOTT MILLER Twenty-five. 

00:32:35
DON MEICHENBAUM Twe-- 25. Okay. I just exaggerate. Oh, tell, tell them about it. Okay. What do you think about... 

00:32:40
SCOTT MILLER Actually, actually, where you can get the measures of that at my website, it's scottdmiller.com, uhm, and, ah, this idea about engagement and, and we certainly have some ideas about, about this but if you look at the core coming conditions that I showed you in the slide, alliance, empathy, uhm, congruence, positive regard, goal consensus, ah, I think there are multiple ways to as-- assess ongoing engagement. At the same time, you have to be realistic. You're working six to eight hours a day seeing people. The idea that you can be conscious of all your efforts to engage clients, I just think, is it's just impossible. So we have to, we have to be able to cue you when you are not engaging your client. Listen to the difference. Not when you are engaging your clients because of the time, frankly, you do engage your clients. Again, the outcomes are good, are you with me here? There's a critical distinction to be made. Look for when you're not engaging. How are you gonna find that out? You're going to have to ask the person who is engage. If you wanna find out if a comedian is funny, don't ask the comedian. You need to ask the audience. You need to watch the audience's response and if they're not laughing it's not because they're in the pre-contemplative stage of humor, okay. It's because you're not funny, frankly, that's just the way it is or your brand of humor doesn't play with them. So, what can you do? And I'm, of course, can underline what Don has said here. I think you need to ask the client and secondly, I don't think you can rely on your own judgment, frankly. Uhm, we experience the therapeutic process very differently from the people that we work with. Uhm, we are prone to the fundamental attribution bias, we look in a world full of ambiguity for confirmation that we're on the right track. What we need to do is ask our clients at some regular routine, regular routine formalized way did we do it, especially looking for those times when aren't engaged and you can use our tools. Again, it's scottdmiller.com, there are two, there's the ORS which is our outcome scale and the SRS which is our alliance measure. They're not the greatest tools in the world but they-- if-- for-- through a variety of randomized clinical trials have shown that if you start to use them, you catch this engagement errors. The biggest sign of a lack of engagement is what Don said earlier that by the fifth session, 70% of people drop out. Uhm, let me say one other thing. Yes, the model number of sessions is one. I think it makes perfect sense to work within that idea but we also know at the same time that if people came twice, their outcomes would be better and more durable. If they came five times to time, they'd be even better still. Does that mean we should blast all people in and tie them to the sea? Absolutely not. What it means is we should improve our ability to keep people engaged - 

00:35:20
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:35:20
SCOTT MILLER - over a longer period of time. After all, isn't that what your dentist does when they send you that little card in the mail that says, "It's time for a checkup"? And isn't it cool that when you go there and they don't find a cavity, you still pay? 

00:35:40
DON MEICHENBAUM I have a dentist story. 

00:35:40
SCOTT MILLER You do. 

00:35:40
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. So, I go for orthodontic surgery. I don't know if I need it or not, - 

00:35:50
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:35:50
DON MEICHENBAUM - right, and, ah, the guy scrapes, does all this stuff and afterwards-- and then the task afterwards is he tells me I have to floss. You, you don't wanna do it. So, what becomes really interesting is we were writing this book on Treatment Adherence. So, consider all of the strategies that my dentist has to get me to be compliant with flossing. He can use fear, "Don, you think the last surgery hurt? You don't floss. You have absolutely no idea what's down the pike, okay?" He can use guilt. "I was raised on guilt. You're kidding me? Don, given everything that we've done, you are not going to floss? You're gonna leave with that? Okay?" He has a variety of strategies. 

00:36:40
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:36:40
DON MEICHENBAUM You know what he says to me? He says, "Don, I know you're a very, very busy person so I'll tell you what I want you to do. Just floss those teeth you wanna keep." The-- I-- here's-- just-- pick those out and do those, okay. Don't waste your time on the others." Now, that is brilliant. I mean, ah, that-- you know, I'm sitting and I go, "That is good." Okay, I jumped out of the chair, I call my publisher on the Treatment Adherence, "Have we gone to the press?" He says no. I say, "I gotta put my dentist in it. So if you go to our book on Treatment Adherence, I've a whole thing on my dentist. Okay. So one of the things that becomes really interesting is he has a variety of strategies just like psychotherapists do, you know, in terms of being a surrogate frontal lobe, let me show what's gonna happen, here's a picture of what your mouth will look like or you pay so much money, you know, insurances are coming in the next surgery, right? You know, so he has a variety of strategy just like therapists do. So what was so good about his strategy, about just floss those teeth that you wanna keep? Okay. And not only that, I now tell the story and other pe-- in fact, for Christmas, someone who's at my workshop sent me a whole package of floss. No. I think that's engagement by people who are hearing my presentations, okay? That's my dentist story. 

00:38:10
SCOTT MILLER That's your dentist story. Ah, I have a Bruce Lee story and my Bruce Lee story is this that, ah, there's a famous line in one of the movies, I can't remember which one it is, ah, where Bruce Lee says, "When the finger point at the moon, don't look at finger. You might miss moon." I think that the stories, I think that the idea that you-- we can copy down the story and say it to other people and it will work is a mistake of u-- of, of, of great proportion. It's not about this particular technique or strategy. Uhm, if we're looking at people like your dentist, ah, there are certain dentist who get greater compliance than others. This was another point you run to. 

00:39:00
DON MEICHENBAUM Yes. 

00:39:00
SCOTT MILLER That's what we're studying right now. What is it about these people that makes them organize their knowledge in such a way that they pluck out one of these gems of wisdom at just the right point as opposed to the rest of us, me included here, that says that same thing? But it falls flat. And if you've been to a workshop I know you've experienced this. I can remember the first time I saw Jay Haley back in the '80s and I was bowled over by watching the video. I went home and tried it and none of it worked for me. Ah, you know, I-- you saw the film where they shave their heads and they bury the hair in the hole, you know. I, I wanted one of my clients to do that. 

00:39:40
DON MEICHENBAUM You ask your client to sh... 

00:39:45
SCOTT MILLER No, I-- but I, I said, "Just think of your hair gone." 

00:39:45
DON MEICHENBAUM Oh, I see. 

00:39:50
SCOTT MILLER And it didn't work. My point here is that you can create a pharmacopeia of these different strategies and it will make no difference to your outcomes because it's not about that. It's about how these people process information, see ho-- what idea in this context what that person will make a difference. 

00:40:05
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. Right. 

00:40:05
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, how can you do that? Practice these basic core skills over and over and over again. 

00:40:15
DON MEICHENBAUM If Carl Rogers, - 

00:40:15
SCOTT MILLER Hmm. 

00:40:15
DON MEICHENBAUM - was sitting here, - 

00:40:15
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:40:20
DON MEICHENBAUM - what will he say about your presentation? I mean, what do you-- how far have we come from, you know, all the things that he interacts and those people then? You know, cuz a lot of those has co-- you know, the genuineness, the unconditional regard, the, you know, the positive empathy. I mean that's all there. You know, you've added couple of more on to that process but, you know, ah, you know. 

00:40:45
SCOTT MILLER What would he say? 

00:40:45
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. You know-- and besides going, "Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm." 

00:40:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

00:40:50
DON MEICHENBAUM And knowing that when they analyze Carl Rogers, - 

00:40:50
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:40:55
DON MEICHENBAUM - okay, the people who were operate-oriented, they found out that his "uh-hmm, uh-hmm" we're very contingent. 

00:41:00
SCOTT MILLER Uh-hmm. 

00:41:00
DON MEICHENBAUM You know, even though it was positive regard, he had an operating based schedule in him. 

00:41:00
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:05
DON MEICHENBAUM So, uh-hmm, what do you think he would say? No, I mean, how, how far we come from, you know... 

00:41:10
SCOTT MILLER I, I think we've actually come quite far since Rogers' early days. 

00:41:10
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:41:15
SCOTT MILLER Ah, I think all of this stand on the shoulders of, of Rogers. The issue is maybe what Steven Hayes would call perspective taking that if we see it that empathy is not something you do, it's something that client experiences. And so we have to find out does the client experience this and then we find out that certain client's experience that more with certain therapists. And we now have to study the therapist and find out how do they know to do those particular things. 

00:41:40
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. No. I, I think we have come and that's - 

00:41:45
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:41:45
DON MEICHENBAUM - why I asked you that question, that kind of thing. Uhm, you think we should ask these people to participate? 

00:41:50
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:41:50
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:41:50
DON MEICHENBAUM Okay. If you could stand, you're welcome to go up to one of the mikes here or whatever if you want to ask questions and, ah, raise issues, we'd be happy to use the little bit of time to, ah, you know, a-- allow that. So, there, there are mikes here and we-- ah, just make sure you direct every questions to Scott Miller. 

00:42:20
 Hi, Scott. This question is for you. I attended your three-hour workshop, - 

00:42:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:42:25
 - and you... 

00:42:25
DON MEICHENBAUM Could you get closer to the mike, ma'am? 

00:42:25
 Closer? Okay. 

00:42:30
DON MEICHENBAUM Yes, please. 

00:42:30
 I attended your three-hour, uhm, presentation the other day and you said, but didn't answer it during the course of the three hours, that you were just average and you were gonna tell us why you were just average. Do you remember that? 

00:42:45
DON MEICHENBAUM Did you say that? 

00:42:50
SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:42:50
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:42:55
SCOTT MILLER I spend my time deliber-- for those of you who weren't there, we were talking about deliberate practice which is Ericcson's contribution to the development of expertise. 

00:43:00
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:43:00
SCOTT MILLER That what you spend of the most time on, you'll end up better at surprisingly if you practice in certain kinds of ways. And I just don't spend that particular time. I can tell you that using the outcome tools, my outcomes have become more tightly clustered around the mean. In other words, I have less variability in my outcomes. They're tighter. I'm delivering a consistently more average product whereas before sometimes you were great, sometimes you were shit. Now, you're just sort of modeling all the time. In order to get better at something, there is this other crucial step that we've notice this top performing therapist doing and, and as I mentioned we have, we have data now, at least initial study of top performing therapist which suggest that they spent 14½ times more hours outside of practice practicing their skills. Fourteen and a half more times outside of their practices practicing to develop. 

00:44:00
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. 

00:44:05
 Thank you. 

00:44:05
DON MEICHENBAUM Is it-- is-- you need the 10,000 hours, right? 

00:44:05
SCOTT MILLER As a start, Ericcson now says 10,000 hours is a sort of a start. 

00:44:10
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:44:10
SCOTT MILLER Uhm, most, ah, world-class, ah, performers - ice skaters, violinists - are up around 20 to 25,000 hours of practice, it's 12 to 15 years, so you think of, ah, Olympic athletes and such. Yeah. 

00:44:25
DON MEICHENBAUM Right. 

00:44:25
SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:44:25
DON MEICHENBAUM Yes, please. 

00:44:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:44:25
 Hello, uhm, so given the, the, the evidence for the last 40 years that, uhm, the secret into putting this, this alliance, what, what is the, ah, foundation, use some foundation like this one that has this huge trainings every four years. What are they saying about this and focusing more on this and then the, you know, the individual techniques and pretty notice emphasis on the individual theories. What do-- what do-- what does, what does Jeff Zeig said? 

00:44:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:44:55
DON MEICHENBAUM All right. I, I-- you know, maybe the sound is not good, but, ah, can you just give us the trust of the-- I wanna make sure where you address your issue. 

00:45:00
 It's just that-- so what is the... 

00:45:00
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. They, they're turning it down. 

00:45:05
 I'm off. Just want... 

00:45:05
DON MEICHENBAUM Ah, you know what? Why don't you just come tell us the question. We'll repeat the questions. These mikes are not working really well. I wanna make sure we addre-- we'll repeat his question. 

00:45:15
 What does the foundation mean about, ah, the sexiness being in the alliance now and what are they planning for future events like this or that's the emphasis instead of putting the sexy and the techniques. 

00:45:25
DON MEICHENBAUM Okay. He has a question for Jeff Zeig. I mean, if Miller's right, who the hell are you gonna invite to the next Evolutions Conference, right? No, I, I mean, you know, it's interesting in terms of who, who-- what gets promoted, you know, ah, you-- you know, we've done-- I do a lot of consultations for people who run residential programs and so forth and you go around to all these booths and I don't know if you watch the news yesterday of this, ah, young boy here in California who killed four people and a psychologist came on and said he was suffering from called affluenza, okay. He wa-- he was-- he grew up in a home that was too rich and they're sending him to some residential program that has econ therapy, that has cooking, that has all these things and it turns out that going to these residential programs do not lead to behavior change, okay. And, in fact, you can go online, ah, on, on my handout here and, ah, we had a friend that apropos this question, ah, who's son had OxyContin addiction, he was suicidal, he had a history of trauma, and she asked me what residential program would I recommend given my consultation all over. And I said, you know, I'm, I'm not here to recommend one program but I'll tell you what I really do. I will write you a letter that you should send to the head of every treatment center and depending upon their answer, you should choose. That letter is in your handout. If we can get those centers to answer those questions about engagement and the like, then I think we can elevate the nature of the treatment. So, if, if, if I was in charge of the next Evolution Conference, you know, and I, I must confess that I, I actually see this conference as see them before they die. I, I, I don't wanna get morbid but when I get invited, I get my cholesterol level checked. I figured Jeff know something that I haven't figured out yet, okay? You look healthy. You'll be hear a long time walking toward the same thing. 

00:47:35
SCOTT MILLER Gee. I don't know. I'm starting to worry. 

00:47:35
DON MEICHENBAUM So, anyway, so, I, I think it would be interesting in a future Evolutions Conference to have a debate, okay, this kind of thing going on publicly about, you know, the things that we're talking about here about therapeutic alliance engagement versus those people who are advocating evidence-based interventions. And the question would be can you mediate this back to the VA and other people who are now mandating that you gotta do those therapies. Yeah. 

00:48:05
SCOTT MILLER First, I, I hope I can clarify this and answer in a way that's understandable. This isn't either or. So it's not either you do the model or you do the alliance. That's m-- maintaining the same kind of thinking that the alliance is now the model. That's, that's not the right way. You need some structure to deliver the alliance and that particular structure in our field doesn't seem to have anything in it that is uniquely curative except for it's a structure which means the structure also has to fit the times. If you have a model then that is probably tied to when you were trained that fit prevailing cultural conditions at that time. It's not very hard to think of it in that way. In industrial era, we had behaviorism, during the Cold War period we had strategic therapy, and now we have more post-modern therapies, we have a much more, ah, diverse culture that we live in, ah, with rapid change, etcetera. It makes sense to think in a post-modern way in some ways. So, you need to have a structure to deliver the alliance. You can't just be the alliance and I would say pick one that makes sense to you and that fits for the majority of people you work with and there are hundreds of choices here. Where I think I get stuck is in the hubris that this model is better and if you don't-- and this is this idea with evidence-based factors, and if you don't do it, well then, you're not helping your clients with PTSD or you're not helping your clients with that particular problem. For which I say show me the data, show me the data, it's just wrong. But you'll hear often with people who promote a particular model this bifurcation or common factors versus specific factors. Stop thinking like this. It's all therapeutic factors and your structure model is one of those factors. 

00:50:00
DON MEICHENBAUM Ah, if you haven't read Persuasion and Healing by Jerome Frank, you should do so. The-- it's a really interesting account of his looking at the communality, of course, now with psychotherapy b-- with all forms of healing and, ah, I, I had the good fortune of, ah, being on NIMH Committees with him and, ah, he had a real impact on, on my understanding the mechanism. Thank you for waiting, ma'am. 

00:50:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:50:25
 Well, I have a concern that research sometimes, uhm, blurs the data into average data and doesn't look at the patient that really, really gets better versus the ones that just thought average. But-- and so I have the question of where does the data capture the, the patient's experience of really getting better? Is there any place in the data that that shows up? And I have this fantasy of creating a, a group of therapist that would help each other with the difficult patients and say, "Okay, that patient isn't getting better. What can we do differently?" Wha-- is there any role for that given what the research is showing? 

00:51:05
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:51:10
SCOTT MILLER So, the first, the first question was about the research and our clients really getting better. Of course, the, the way we've traditionally done research is you randomize people into two groups and then you compare the means. And so the, the difficulty with that kind of research is overcoming the within cell variability. Let me say it again. When you do this kind of research, there is huge variability between the people within the condition. That's why it's so hard to do that kind of research. Secondly, when they find that two methods, that there's no difference in outcome between them, it doesn't mean that both methods work equally well with everybody. The k-- the-- this is what's so confusing about it. So, what it means in essence is the client and you have to find out the-- do-- what you have to offer them, does that actually helpful to them which is why we've sort of given up trying to find the white-- right model and instead say measure and see early on. Is your client engaged with you and are they getting better? Let's give up the quest for the Holy Grail of treatment models. Uhm, that's the, that's the, the first answer. Is there any use in talking with your colleagues? If there are any good, yes. The problem is that very often the stories we tell each other create, ah,-- decrease the independence of the opinions we have. So if you can present your ideas and have that-- have your colleagues write down what they would do or ha-- ah, write down what they would do without interacting with each other, you're gonna get a much better quality of response. But if you all start talking about it, what you'll end up doing is in infecting each other with the same kind of thinking. You will arrive at a consensus that probably won't help too much. What we would advise is find a coach whose work you admire and whose outcomes are known and let them push you to your edge of reliable performance. 

00:53:05
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:53:10
 Uhm, I, I have an evaluation form that I give my client before and after each session. I just was wondering about what you do with the conundrum of seeing a couple when they, you know, even if they would consider giving up blame for a few minutes, ah, how you manage the alliance with two people in a room, I just want you to speak to that. 

00:53:35
SCOTT MILLER How you manage the alliance with two people... 

00:53:40
 Yeah, who have-- who are busy, you know, justifying and, and blame comes up here and there and, and because it does seem like almost like a sibling relationship where they're vying for your favor. So, I wanted you to speak to the alliance in that context. 

00:53:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA #EVO2013 

00:53:55
DON MEICHENBAUM Do you wanna comment on that first? Do you wanna comment on that first? 

00:54:00
SCOTT MILLER Okay. Ah, first, first up, ah, this-- I hope this-- you'll hear this as maybe incongruent. I have no advice for you about how to do your alliances with your clients. 

00:54:10
 Okay. 

00:54:10
SCOTT MILLER I have no advice about that. What I will say is that it's not uncommon that when you evaluate the alliance at the end of the session, you get very different opinions and you should attend to the person who was least align with you and figure out what it was and you should shift the burden to your shoulders for managing that. The thing I find in couples very often is one of the partners lets me off the hook. They-- when I look at the scores I say, "Well, you know, your score was a little lower," and one of them says, "That's because she's an idiot." She ran her mouth the whole time or he did this or he said that, whatever it is and I say, "What do I need to do differently about that?" 

00:54:50
DON MEICHENBAUM The other thing that's interesting and not only with regard to couples and you'll see this in the papers that I've written, ah, is that if you run groups the assessment of the level of group cohesion is a predictor of outcome. So it's the degree to which the group feels that they're working in, in a kind of, ah, commensurate fashion to achieve the goal. And, and, and therefore, there are variety of tools that are available either with couples or with, uhm, ah, groups that you could use to assess and nurture that kind of alliance. Ah, from my point of view, the, the caution for doing couples work and Sue Johnson and others highlights this is that you're really a consultant on the process in making sure that you're not inadvertently exacerbating the nature of the distress that they're having. So this is where the Columbo routine for me in working with couples comes in all the time because I have a, a, a notion of going public with the data. By going public with the data, I say, "Gu-- I, I noticed something. I wonder if you noticed it too." And then I go public with the, ah, nature of the observation, uhm, and for those who have been in my workshop I use this, quote, metaphor to ex-- to give them feedback and then to find out what they take of that. Ah, and, and, and-- am I just seeing this or are you just seeing it as well? So the whole notion is that we're both, I and the couple, are having a common goal. Remember that collaborative goal setting is really the key because one of the things that I would add to his list is that you have to nurture hope in the client and if you look at the work of C.R. Snyder and all of those folks, ah, having, ah, smart goals - specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time limit goals, ah, is really important. Because we've goal setting, ah, you are in the business in the business of nurturing hope. So, I say to clients, "Look, uhm, let me explain what I do for a living. It's really not that complicated. See, I work with folks just like yourself and I try to find out how things are right now in your life and moreover how you would like it to be and what could we, therapeutic alliance, do to help you get there. Moreover, I would like to know what the two of you or what he-- you tried in the past. What has worked, what has not worked as evident by, where did you have difficulty following through with, what were you particularly satisfied with," and if we work together and I hope we can how would we know that we're making progress. What would we see changed? What would other people notice? And permit me to ask one last question, can you foresee, can you envision anything that might get in the way of our achieving that goal? Now, I don't ask all those questions in shot like this but over the course of the session I'm going to do so. Note that every single question I just ask is a "what" and "how" question. I do not ask "why" questions. "Why" questions are not very productive. So this is my way of nurturing engagement and then over the course of therapy I'm going to say how did this session help us achieve that goal? How much closer are we? So the goal may be and especially when you have distress couples to get them to work on the, ah, comparable goals. Ah, I, I think we have time for just one more question cuz I have to get all the way over by 9:20 to the next panel. So, ma'am you have the last.

 Yes, thank you for that. Uhm, what I've heard at this conference so far is-- has got particularly about the therapist who's responsible for the therapeutic alliance and best practices that we get some feedback at the end of the session and with genuine and compassionate and, and, uhm, have a capacity to hold the client wherever they are, and that most of us average therapists but I would wonder how you would respond if I said, "Well, I think we're really bad if we put all of our energy in and they only turn up for four 50-minute sessions and then we don't see them again. So, to me that speaks of a failure in this perfect type of relationship that we've embodied for them in this very, uhm, safe place and after four, four lots of hours have had enough of this and they don't come back. So was that average or most of us on the lower end of the average or in the failed stakes as therapists, ah, either.

SCOTT MILLER Ah, I would-- see, it depends on what you compare it to and so it-- the, the chief competitor here would be say medicine and if you compare the outcome side by side with medical practices, things that are widely accepted, cost lots of money and people sign up for, then psychotherapy outcomes, it's something we should be very proud of. Stand head and shoulders with those, with those outcomes with a far more tolerable side effect profile. We've made, as I said in my workshop on Wednesday, we've made the Olympic trials, - 

01:00:25
 Hmm. 

01:00:25
SCOTT MILLER - the next bit of improvement, however, will require substantial effort. That, that-- to get people to come one additional session rather than one last, that will require substantial on our part. To connect with one more person in our practice that we usually lose, that will require substantial effort. Because being average also has an effect of thinking, "You know, it's good enough. Why work harder when I only get paid the same." 

01:00:55
DON MEICHENBAUM I have, ah, one last observation before we break and that is you need to know that I have been on the panel for an early hour thing with a gentleman who is not wearing shoes. It was like going to the oracle at Delphi, I mean, what, you know. Uhm, I, I do hope you brought then - 

01:01:25
SCOTT MILLER Yes, I did. 

01:01:25
DON MEICHENBAUM - in to the next-- okay. We will see you all in four years, hopefully, it will be later in the afternoon but thank you for attendance and interest. 

01:01:35
SCOTT MILLER Thanks for coming.
