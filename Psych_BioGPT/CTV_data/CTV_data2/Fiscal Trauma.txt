Fiscal Trauma with Vanessa Jackson, LCSW 

00:00:30
VANESSA JACKSON Well, how I came to work with fiscal trauma, uh, comes out of a couple of things. One is my social work degree is in social and economic development. So I was already wired to think about money and economics and these larger policy issues and it was also women's issues and certainly the feminism of poverty. So there was a way that money and power, uh, were sort of part of my, my clinical thinking, uh, and I did always try to hold it. But what really led me to sort of try to dive in deeply and understand this other thing that was happening, uh, came out of a very personal experience. I had, um, spent a couple of years doing research on African-American psychiatric history for a very, very small fee and sort of failed to understand that if I was getting paid a very small fee and was traveling, I wasn't making money in my clinical practice. And so, I very quickly burned through all my savings and, um, was really starting to feel this drag. I couldn't understand why I wasn't as motivated and why I had this sort of anxiety creeping in. And again, that's really not part of my nature. I've had traditionally an "enough" relationship. I was raised working class, African-American working class in the Midwest, and um, I always had enough, you know? It wasn't tons, uh, but my parents gave me great, sort of, values, I felt like around money, including things like "money don't grow on trees". But also, there was not anxiety, there was never worries about utilities being cut off, and always a sense that they had it handled. And so, going into college and you know, having tough times as anyone might have when you're young and not working. But again, all that temporary. Fine, handle it. Coming out of this research experience, having bought a house, doing my own private practice and suddenly not having enough money. And, to this point where I was like, am I going to be able to pay my mortgage? And so, it had happened that this was hit sort of a crisis point when I had been invited to be a key note speaker in, um, Hawaii. So I'm literally sitting on Waikiki Beach. I call it my Waikiki Beach experience. Some of the most expensive real estate in the U.S., um, and it just dawned on me that one, I'm depressed. And, I'm depressed specifically because I don't know if I'm going to have my mortgage money. And, I'm really, really hoping that these people pay me this keynote fee so I can, so I can take care of that. So in that moment, two things happened for me, is I was aware that there's this thing going on that was having a profound impact on my emotional functioning, that was specific to income and money. And um, the other thought was, I'm a person who has always had enough. I'm a person, uh, even in this moment, I know it's temporary. Whether it's temporary because they're going to me this check or temporary because I'm going to go back and in fact I could go back and find a job and take the, to some degree, the question out of it. But I thought, what happens to somebody that doesn't have the experience of "enoughness", and has no reasonable belief that financially anything's going to change? If I collapsed, and I did collapse emotionally. Anxiety, depression, resentment, anger, shame to some extent, like I can't pay my . . . What? I mean, if I collapsed so quickly coming from a foundation of relative security, what happens to someone that never had that security or no reason to believe that they're going to get it again? This research question sort of came up for me. I also came up with this term, fiscal trauma. It's like when we talk about sexual trauma and emotional trauma and fiscal trauma and hurricanes, natural disasters are traumatic events for people. I had never really heard people talk about this financial situation as a trauma. And, when we think about trauma especially, you know we think about these, sort of these life, these catastrophic, life-threatening kind of experiences that really compromise people and then have an after effect even after they are safely out of that situation. It's not even so much that it's life-threatening. It's, it's actually, and I really sort of thought about this a little bit more recently, it's almost soul-shattering. It shatters something in a sense of security and a sense of self that then has a sort of cascading effect around people's sense of competency, um, for anybody, a sense of shame. And what I hear a lot of times from my clients, is like, it is very shameful not to be able to take care of myself and, or my children. When I saw what it meant to me, how have I been attending to my clients and their financial realities and how their changing financial situations may impact, what is their capacity to negotiate other problems in their lives, um, as well as a sort of core sense of self and shame. You know, one of the thing I think this fiscal, looking at fiscal trauma is especially timely now. I think it's always been timely for people who have been on the economic margins. What we have now and what therapists need to be able to tend to is this whole crop of people who are used to always having. They did the American dream, they did all the right things and now with the economic collapse of the last couple years, are struggling. Unemployment's run out. And, and, so people are then showing up, or not even being able to know if they can show up in therapy at a time when they need it most, is with this incredible sense of shame and anxiety and depression. Often times, that person may not say that money and this fiscal wound, this trauma is underneath it. And so, there's a way then as therapists we need to listen. And, uh, sometimes even ask. You can ask in a couple of different ways as a therapist. You can ask, one, is just doing some family background. You do a genogram or something where you're asking, tell me about your social class, growing up. What's your social class now. Have there been any changes? And being able to ask it in a way that normalizes the experience. And so the wounding that happens when people are compromised financially is really profound and has some long standing effects. So, I think as therapists, we really want to start listening for anxiety, um, talking about family conflicts, you know, loss. I mean, some of things that we might think are, or seem like not that, shouldn't be that big of a deal, whether it's a loss of vacation or a loss of ability to allow your child to, um, be on the football team because it ends up costing so much. That parents across the economic spectrum are struggling with those losses and the shame and those sort of things. So I think that's the kind of stuff that we want to listen to and bring out and hopefully in the clinical environment. You know one of the things that I think is really always important to, when we're thinking about, again, across economic lines, uh, is, you know, asking people how's money . . . I mean, it can be as simple as saying like, tell me about your relationship with money. Is, do you feel like there's enough and how do you define enough? One of the things that was very interesting for me is I had an opportunity to work with a domestic violence program here on doing a small research project that then was the basis for their, uh, putting together a program called "Women Make Change". Uh, although I think it should have been "Women Make Dollars, Lots of Dollars". But um, what they were trying to look at was the issue of economic abuse. So, it's a little, it's fiscal trauma but it's a subcategory of it in terms of when women are experiencing financial abuse in the context of their relationships. And that can be the withholding of money, the bartering with money, power, money used as control. Families, as well as, uh, to keep women often times in place, if they leave they will be deprived of financial resources. And so that's a whole other way that that money issue shows up in the clinical interface. In doing that research, one of the things I found with this very small, like 30 person, sample is that the truth of the matter is mainly the women were actually either the primary, if not only, breadwinner in these mostly working class situations. But that the male partners were costing them money because they, and yet, there still was this other thing happening about this narrative about partnership, and men as the head of the household. And so, what you need to look at is there's all these other, kind of, power language embedded in this money. So it's not just a clean, do you have enough money? What's enough money? But there's all these other sort of expectations and societal expectations wrapped around it. Um, and so, you know, one of the things though that I found really powerful, because we asked the women in these structured interviews, were what were their family experiences around money. And, what seemed to be, I can only think of the, between these people, two or three people who felt that there was any real conversation about money, and modeling of money practices that made sense. Even if there was enough money in the family, uh, either they weren't privy to the conversations about money, so by the time they left the household, they had no skill around negotiating. They had no sense about how bills were paid. I remember one mother saying, you know, I'm paying $300 a month for healthcare. I can't afford to keep paying $300 a month for healthcare but at the same time, my physical health is the only thing standing between my child and total disaster. Do I keep paying $300 or do I drop my health insurance? And those are the kind of conversations that clinically we have to be prepared to help people engage and process. And we have to talk about the problems and challenges of that. What that felt like for her and the lack of safety. But also the reality of about, like, if she suddenly had an extra $300 for three months she could actually put a rent deposit down and not live in a hotel. And so there's those kind of things that we weren't maybe often times prepared for in our clinical training that are just very real world things. Um, which again though, helps our clients, or my clients at least. Say, okay I get how you feel about it, now let's figure out what you're going to do about it. And, and creating space in the therapy in a loving and supportive and nonjudging space in which to make some of those really, really difficult decisions. I think this is a really good time now to bring Alissa into the room and we're going to let you in on our conversation in the course of her therapy around dealing with issues of fiscal trauma and her steps toward getting back into her power around a situation involving money. Hi Alissa, how are you doing this week? 

00:12:30
ALISSA Not good. 

00:12:35
VANESSA JACKSON Whoa, what's going on? 

00:12:35
ALISSA I lost my job. 

00:12:35
VANESSA JACKSON What happened? 

00:12:40
ALISSA Well, my department was just, said they weren't going to use it anymore. And they gave us . . . We came in on Thursday and they told us we didn't need to show up Monday and we could clean out our desks on Friday. And that was that. 

00:12:55
VANESSA JACKSON So, where did that? So how did you? Does any processing happen at work? Are they, did they talk to you down there? 

00:13:05
ALISSA No, no. They treated us like we were criminals. But, and I mean I understand some of it, because when you're in information technology, they think you might sabotage which . . . Nobody's going to do that. 

00:13:15
VANESSA JACKSON You wouldn't do it. 

00:13:15
ALISSA No. But anyway, so I don't have a job. And Jason, um, was caught with marijuana. 

00:13:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:13:25
ALISSA And supposedly, he stole money out of the teacher's purse to buy the marijuana. 

00:13:35
VANESSA JACKSON So. 

00:13:35
ALISSA So now they're charging him with possession. So I had to get a, try to get a lawyer. You got to have my savings and everything. And I thought I was going to be okay and then with this . . . I'm just really in trouble. 

00:13:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. I want you take a, why don't you take a couple of deep breaths. I know we're going to talk about it. We can't fix everything but we're going to talk about it. Um, what's the piece that hurts the most right now? 

00:14:05
ALISSA I don't know. You know, the job meant a lot to me. 

00:14:10
VANESSA JACKSON I remember when you talked about it that it was a place where you got to shine. 

00:14:10
ALISSA Yeah. It was, it meant a lot to me. So now, you know, I don't even have community anymore. You know I don't even get to do my tapes anymore. And then this child. Of all the times in the world, and he didn't have to steal. I mean, I don't want him smoking marijuana but he didn't have to steal from the teacher's purse. That was just so stupid. 

00:14:35
VANESSA JACKSON Just take a moment. Just be right there with that. So, right now, it's sort of even hard to tease out which is the hardest part of it, is what I'm hearing you say. 

00:14:50
ALISSA It's all hard. 

00:14:55
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. Well, what we're going to need to do is start somewhere, because otherwise if you keep it all hard, remember we talked about the spiral, it's like they're all colliding. And we gotta take them, and tease them apart a little bit. Okay? And I want to start where you, you said something, the last thing you said. Because one thing you had used really well to ground yourself, is your . . . 

00:15:15
ALISSA I'm mad. 

00:15:15
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, you seem mad. Tell me about it. 

00:15:20
ALISSA I'm just so angry. I worked so hard and this is the thanks that I get. 

00:15:30
VANESSA JACKSON Thanks from who? 

00:15:30
ALISSA From my company. I put in 14 hour days, 5 days a week, and then they treat me like a criminal. And then my son, acts like a criminal. I'm mad. 

00:15:45
VANESSA JACKSON Mm-hmm. How well do you do mad? 

00:15:50
ALISSA Well, I'm mad in here. 

00:15:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. What I'm going to invite is get mad out here a little bit. 

00:15:55
ALISSA I don't think you could handle that, lady. 

00:16:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Tell, tell me what, what I might see that has you worried for me or worried for you? 

00:16:05
ALISSA Just worry for the world, because I am just really . . . There's a rage inside of me right now. 

00:16:15
VANESSA JACKSON You know this is a place . . . 

00:16:15
ALISSA It hurts. 

00:16:15
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, it does. 

00:16:15
ALISSA It just hurts. I'm mad but it's the pain in my, it's like somebody just stabbed me, you know? 

00:16:25
VANESSA JACKSON Alissa, you just did something that I want to point out to you. It's really important, is that, because I was just about to say, the thing about anger, it's a secondary emotion. Anger always stands in front of something else that's more vulnerable. And you immediately named it, which is the sadness. Okay. So, how can we be with that sadness for a few minutes? Who have you talked to about what's going on? 

00:16:50
ALISSA Nobody. I wouldn't tell anybody. No. 

00:16:55
VANESSA JACKSON That you lost your job? 

00:16:55
ALISSA No. 

00:16:55
VANESSA JACKSON Tell me why. 

00:16:55
ALISSA Because, then I go back to being judged. 

00:17:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:17:05
ALISSA Even though it wasn't my fault. But see that's stuff with Daddy, that wasn't my fault either. 

00:17:10
VANESSA JACKSON But you got judged. 

00:17:10
ALISSA But I was judged. Yeah. 

00:17:10
VANESSA JACKSON You know, I want to add something to this. Because when you talk about the judgment, it's sort of like you're keeping people out. Cuz one, because you don't like other attention doesn't look like it's going to be helpful. You don't think it's going to be helpful, right? 

00:17:25
ALISSA Well, I know, not with my siblings, for sure. 

00:17:30
VANESSA JACKSON You know it's not going to be helpful. 

00:17:30
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:17:30
VANESSA JACKSON But there's something on top of the hurt and the old wound that we've been talking about, you know, over the last couple of months, is I think there's a new wound. And it's something I call, fiscal trauma. You know we talk about . . . 

00:17:40
ALISSA Who? 

00:17:40
VANESSA JACKSON Fiscal. Fiscal. F-I-S-C-A-L. 

00:17:45
ALISSA Oh. 

00:17:45
VANESSA JACKSON Fiscal, not physical. 

00:17:45
ALISSA Oh. Cuz I was like, I've had enough of physical trauma. 

00:17:55
VANESSA JACKSON But here's the thing. So when you think about, you know, you hear people talk about physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse. 

00:18:00
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:18:00
VANESSA JACKSON But people don't talk about, sort of, like the financial abuse, and especially when it's an economy or a company or a kid that's now created some expenses. 

00:18:10
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:18:15
VANESSA JACKSON It's an injury too. Does that make sense? 

00:18:15
ALISSA When you say it like that, yeah. 

00:18:20
VANESSA JACKSON Cuz, cuz, and the reason why I feel like it's important to say that is so you can start feeling, kind of crazy in fact, like you're so disoriented, like, what am I'm gonna do? How am I going to pay the bills? You're still with all that hurt and fear and I want to do a little checking with you because often times, especially when people lose income and they're trying to figure out how to pay their bills and everything, that there's some degree of shame. 

00:18:45
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:18:45
VANESSA JACKSON Does that sound . . . 

00:18:50
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:18:50
VANESSA JACKSON . . . right? And so I want to talk a little bit about the shame, because that's a real, um, big piece of what I call the fiscal trauma, because it's the thing that keeps you silent. 

00:19:00
ALISSA Okay. 

00:19:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, and I think you're right though. You gotta decide who you're gonna talk to, cuz do you feel more vulnerable than you've felt in a long time? 

00:19:05
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:19:10
VANESSA JACKSON How big, little do you feel? 

00:19:10
ALISSA Small. 

00:19:10
VANESSA JACKSON Very small. Okay. And, and what I say is that smallness, because we have gotten her pretty grown-up, right? That inner you. 

00:19:20
ALISSA Yeah, but this is different. 

00:19:25
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. Tell me about it. What's different about this time? 

00:19:25
ALISSA Well, I've always had money. 

00:19:30
VANESSA JACKSON You've always had money? 

00:19:30
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:19:35
VANESSA JACKSON And what was money like in your childhood home? Was, was there enough money? Were there conflicts about money? 

00:19:40
ALISSA Well Daddy was an attorney. 

00:19:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:19:45
ALISSA So we had money. But he used his for power. He used it over Mommy. 

00:19:50
VANESSA JACKSON In what way? 

00:19:50
ALISSA Well, you know, he . . . She didn't work. He didn't want her to work. And, but I would hear them arguing, and he would use, you know . . . He wouldn't give her money for groceries or if she wanted to buy a dress. Sometimes even if she wanted to buy feminine supplies, she had to go to him and that hurt me for her. 

00:20:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So . . . 

00:20:15
ALISSA So I made up my mind that a man would never control me and my money. 

00:20:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:20:20
ALISSA Or have any control over how I live. And I went to school and I made my money, and now I don't have it. 

00:20:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Do you see that old story connected the new one? So the next question I would ask you is sort of like that message of, sounds like stay in charge of your own money. 

00:20:40
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:20:40
VANESSA JACKSON And suddenly, this external thing, your company, cuts that off for you. 

00:20:45
ALISSA Well, you know, my job and my ability to pay my bills, that's who I am. 

00:20:55
VANESSA JACKSON That's who you are? Can you say more about that? 

00:21:00
ALISSA Well, I mean that's how I build my life. That's my value, my worth. 

00:21:05
VANESSA JACKSON You just said something I think. I wanna sort of slow down and, and look at it a little bit, another layer of it. Because you said, your ability, earning money in your job has been sort of who you are? 

00:21:15
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:21:15
VANESSA JACKSON Can you say a little bit more about what that is? Aside from the obvious about how you finance your life, but like . . . It seemed like there was more than that. 

00:21:25
ALISSA Well, like I said, I made a commitment based on what happened to Mommy that I would never allow myself to be in that position, so I built,[00:21:35 spent my whole life working hard and being financially independent, and, and, and so it really is who I am. And everybody, you know, even my family knows that. That's who they say is dependable. She's there, she's got money. And so now, then they're going to judge me cuz I don't have that. 

00:21:55
VANESSA JACKSON And even though in came in the context of this whole economic meltdown, that's not gonna make a diff- . . . Well does it make a difference to them? Or does it make a difference to you? 

00:22:00
ALISSA It doesn't make a difference to me because I should have seen it coming. 

00:22:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Why should you have seen it coming? 

00:22:10
ALISSA I don't know. I guess I think I should have been paying attention and I should have been more in control of what was going on. I mean, with my financial resources, I mean, you've gotta stay on top of stuff. And I'm sure that if I had, you know, been paying attention, you know, we'd . . . Our company like a company home. And so we get the quarterly reports and so forth. And I'm no math whiz but if I had been looking at those statements, I could have seen that our department was possibly on its way out, so . . . I'm, I'm pissed at myself. 

00:22:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. What I'm hearing is the fear. 

00:22:45
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:22:45
VANESSA JACKSON And you're trying to stay in control cuz that's been your story. 

00:22:50
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:22:50
VANESSA JACKSON And it's your story for a powerful reason too. It's not just because your ego says I need to be in control. You saw what it cost. 

00:23:00
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:23:00
VANESSA JACKSON And, how old were you when you made the decision, I am never going to be put in that place? 

00:23:05
ALISSA Probably about 10. 

00:23:10
VANESSA JACKSON Tell me about that 10 year old girl. Cuz she's in the room right now, you know, right? 

00:23:10
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:23:15
VANESSA JACKSON Huh? 

00:23:15
ALISSA Well, I just remember that Mommy asked Daddy for money for our lunches. And he hauled off and slapped her. And I told myself, I'd never, ever, ever, be in that place, ever! 

00:23:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And you're like, wow, I don't want to be in that position. 

00:23:35
ALISSA Right. 

00:23:35
VANESSA JACKSON The moment . . . Can you remember the moment you made that decision? Can you feel it all? 

00:23:40
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:23:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:23:40
ALISSA I'll never forget it. 

00:23:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:23:45
ALISSA He knocked Mommy to the floor. 

00:23:45
VANESSA JACKSON And so, I'm wondering with that it sounds like there was some power in making the decision, but some powerlessness in seeing your Mom on the floor. 

00:24:00
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:24:00
VANESSA JACKSON So, was it a weird power? Did you feel any power at that moment, or was it all . . . 

00:24:05
ALISSA Well, I just made, I felt like I had to make a choice and a decision that I was never going to be in that space. You know? 

00:24:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:24:15
ALISSA Let myself, let that happen to me. So I guess I did, I, I felt sorry for Mom but something on the inside of me was like, oh, no, no, no. 

00:24:30
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, well, I'm, I'm. Even, do you notice that even in your body right now? Cuz you shifted a little bit, I thought I saw a shift, which is like, oh, no, no, no, no. Is that the voice of helplessness or is that the voice of something else? 

00:24:40
ALISSA I think it's something else. 

00:24:45
VANESSA JACKSON Can we figure out what that something else? Cuz I think, remember how I always talk about how we have to get some anchors? 

00:24:45
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
VANESSA JACKSON Cuz, you know, it's like a grappling hook and you're falling, economically falling. So we need to get a grappling hook to support you. 

00:24:55
ALISSA Okay. 

00:24:55
VANESSA JACKSON And, and it doesn't, it's not going to put another dollar in your pocket immediately. I want to be clear about that. 

00:25:00
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:00
VANESSA JACKSON But you said something and your body language shifted. 

00:25:05
ALISSA Okay. 

00:25:05
VANESSA JACKSON To like, oh no, I am not. You made a decision, and what did you say? A choice. 

00:25:10
ALISSA Yeah, I just didn't want, I just didn't want to live like that. 

00:25:15
VANESSA JACKSON So, we're gonna t- , we're going to go back and find that . . . Cuz did you feel something different too? That, that? 

00:25:25
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:25:25
VANESSA JACKSON Cuz it wasn't feeling helpless. 

00:25:25
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:25:25
VANESSA JACKSON And yet you're going back and you're thinking about a 10 year old kid . . . 

00:25:30
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:30
VANESSA JACKSON . . . who is seeing something. And, you're not an economist, you're not a financial planner, you're not a therapist. But at 10 years old, you made a decision and a choice that has guided your life for the last 35 years. 

00:25:45
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:45
VANESSA JACKSON Are 10 year olds especially powerful? 

00:25:50
ALISSA I, I . . . They can be. 

00:25:55
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And so, your 10 year old showed up kind of powerful cuz you couldn't protect your Mom. 

00:26:00
ALISSA Right. But I knew one day I was going to be able to protect myself because I hadn't been able to protect myself from Daddy and I couldn't even protect Mommy from Daddy. 

00:26:10
VANESSA JACKSON But in that moment, around lunch money, you took a stand. 

00:26:15
ALISSA Mm-hmm. Yeah. That, that I wouldn't have to ask people or anybody for anything, and this is why this is hard. 

00:26:25
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, Alissa, and I want . . . There's a lot going on, and . . . 

00:26:25
ALISSA You're telling me. 

00:26:30
VANESSA JACKSON I know, telling you. And we're going to have to break it down in small pieces. Okay? 

00:26:30
ALISSA Okay. 

00:26:35
VANESSA JACKSON So, um, and what, you just said something about the, the childhood memory of not ever, sort of, being dependent on anybody and that whole sense of you taking care of yourself financially is a way to stay safe. 

00:26:50
ALISSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:55
VANESSA JACKSON You made that connection in that moment when your Dad slapped your Mom. 

00:26:55
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:26:55
VANESSA JACKSON That money and safety were joined. 

00:27:00
ALISSA Right! Yeah. 

00:27:05
VANESSA JACKSON And you see how important that is? One is, it's true. 

00:27:10
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:27:10
VANESSA JACKSON Up to a point. 

00:27:10
ALISSA Okay. 

00:27:10
VANESSA JACKSON But when you got 'em linked like that in a really powerful incident. We gotta almost untangle a little bit. 

00:27:20
ALISSA Okay. 

00:27:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And then that's the thing about like understanding fiscal trauma, is that you gotta understand the story behind it. Like, what happened? 

00:27:30
ALISSA Okay. 

00:27:30
VANESSA JACKSON And so the what happened is you went to really fast. What happened was, um, I saw how my Dad, and you're like a little kid, controlled my Mom and the family, with his money. 

00:27:40
ALISSA Yeah, with his money, yeah. 

00:27:40
VANESSA JACKSON We had enough, but sometimes, it sounds like we didn't have enough. 

00:27:45
ALISSA Right. 

00:27:45
VANESSA JACKSON Because he chose not to give it. 

00:27:50
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:27:50
VANESSA JACKSON And this is the thing that then really stands out for me. We talked about what happened. How it's affecting you now which makes it hard to ask for help, and to be in a position where you might have to ask for help. 

00:28:00
ALISSA Right. 

00:28:00
VANESSA JACKSON It's hard, if not impossible, right now to go there. 

00:28:05
ALISSA Okay. 

00:28:05
VANESSA JACKSON But there's a question which is how, in spite of what happened, that, that money wound . . . 

00:28:10
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:28:15
VANESSA JACKSON Have you been able to triumph. And you sort of offered it up when you said, I was 10 years old watching that and I made a decision. 

00:28:20
ALISSA Okay. 

00:28:20
VANESSA JACKSON And I made a choice. And I've been living out that choice and that choice has kept me safe? 

00:28:30
ALISSA I think. 

00:28:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Has there been any downside to that choice that you can think of? 

00:28:35
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:28:35
VANESSA JACKSON In what way? 

00:28:35
ALISSA Because I think it had, it affected my marriage. 

00:28:40
VANESSA JACKSON In what way? 

00:28:40
ALISSA Well, because I guess, you know, men want to feel in control in some sense, or needed, or whatever. And often times, because of that, what went on with Daddy, I maybe wasn't always as compromising and . . . because I had my own money. And I equated it, the love and all of that kind of got stirred up together. 

00:29:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So love and money and power? 

00:29:05
ALISSA Yeah, yeah. 

00:29:05
VANESSA JACKSON And you know, there's lots of different kinds of power. There's sort of the power within yourself which is what we're talking about how you cultivated in your mobile sanctuary. Uh, that you shifted something in you . . . 

00:29:20
ALISSA Right. 

00:29:20
VANESSA JACKSON . . . to help you feel and experience more power and a sense of yourself. 

00:29:25
ALISSA But the breakdown was then my husband didn't feel needed. 

00:29:30
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And then there's a power with, how you create, and use the relationship how to share power, sort of. 

00:29:35
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:35
VANESSA JACKSON And, but then you had this money wound over the power over, the way your Dad used money. And so, you, sort of early on, decided that money is power . . . 

00:29:45
ALISSA Right. 

00:29:50
VANESSA JACKSON . . . and safety. And so that story's been growing. And so part of it is we just gotta track that story. 

00:29:55
ALISSA Okay. 

00:29:55
VANESSA JACKSON And decide where it's helpful and where does it sort of constrict you. So, in, in, when you talk about, I wanna tie that to this childhood cause you know we talk about the different spirals, the childhood spiral, the sort of current financial crisis spiral, the parenting spiral, you got at least three of them . . . 

00:30:15
ALISSA Okay. 

00:30:15
VANESSA JACKSON . . . happening right now, boom, boom, boom. 

00:30:20
ALISSA At the same time. 

00:30:20
VANESSA JACKSON At the same time. Part of why I want to point that out is again, I've said before, is like the extra hit. 

00:30:25
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:25
VANESSA JACKSON Like you're thinking, oh my God, what's wrong with me, I used to be a stronger woman. 

00:30:30
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:30
VANESSA JACKSON You gotta know that you got these three spirals and they are spinning. They are spinning tough, right? 

00:30:35
ALISSA Yeah. 

00:30:35
VANESSA JACKSON And so . . . 

00:30:40
ALISSA I'm dancing as fast as I can right now. 

00:30:40
VANESSA JACKSON I know. And I'm going to suggest something that's going to sound so counter-intuitive to you, cuz you're dancing as fast as you can. When you were in school, when things were going on, and they said, if you ever caught on fire what they tell you to do? 

00:30:55
ALISSA Drop. 

00:30:55
VANESSA JACKSON Stop, drop, and roll, right? And then stop and be still. 

00:31:00
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:31:00
VANESSA JACKSON Which, when all this stuff is going on and your brain's thinking I gotta do this, I gotta do that. It's like you're just running and running and grabbing and you're think that you're making it happen. We all think that we're making it happen. But it's almost like to try to be still for a second. 

00:31:15
ALISSA Hmm. 

00:31:15
VANESSA JACKSON You know? Just to try to be still for a second. 

00:31:20
ALISSA But then, if I get still, it's going to really come crashing down. 

00:31:25
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And, and, see, you, you're doing your own therapy, do you notice that? Because you're right, it will. It's going to catch up with you. But the fear is it's going to roll over you. 

00:31:35
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:31:35
VANESSA JACKSON And that's what keeps people running, like if I stop, the tiger's going to catch me. As opposed to turning around and seeing that it's maybe not a tiger. It's something hard, it's something hard. I'm not acting as if something big is not happening. 

00:31:50
ALISSA Okay. 

00:31:50
VANESSA JACKSON But it's almost like you're probably not able to use all of your creativity, and what we've already established is you're a pretty creative person. 

00:31:55
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:31:55
VANESSA JACKSON You, you are pretty . . . That 10 year old in you that was like, oh no, I'm not going here. They can't catch up to say, we need to have a meeting. We need to have a board meeting of Alissa, Inc. and decide what's the best course of action. 

00:32:15
ALISSA Okay. 

00:32:15
VANESSA JACKSON Including like how to get the 10 year old to take help. Help that is, um, you're entitled to, whether that's unemployment, other things that might be hard for you to show up for. 

00:32:25
ALISSA Okay. 

00:32:25
VANESSA JACKSON Cuz you're not, you've got no experience doing it. 

00:32:30
ALISSA Okay. 

00:32:30
VANESSA JACKSON And I really want to normalize the fact that if it feels really disorienting, it's because you've got no experience doing this because your whole trajectory since the time you were 10, was sort of do for self. 

00:32:45
ALISSA Mm-hmm. 

00:32:45
VANESSA JACKSON And so, you're, you're just not going have, be as skilled as someone that's used to asking for help. You gotta learn that, you know, while you're doing that at a time when you're feeling really exposed. 

00:33:00
ALISSA Okay. 

00:33:00
VANESSA JACKSON And you know, most of us would feel kind of vulnerable.
