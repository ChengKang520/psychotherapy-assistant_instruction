Carol Kershaw, PhD 

00:00:30
CAROL KERSHAW All right. Well umm… first of all thank you all for coming to this demonstration and especially thank you. 

00:00:40
PEARL WERFEL Thank you. 

00:00:40
CAROL KERSHAW And uh… would you introduce yourself for us? 

00:00:45
PEARL WERFEL I'm Pearl Werfel. I'm a psychologist. Do you want me to say why I'm here or just… 

00:00:50
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… and so yeah, so we talked a little bit about what you wanted to focus in this demonstration and perhaps that would be really helpful if people knew what you wanted to work on. 

00:01:05
PEARL WERFEL Okay. So just a little bit of a story. There are three things, big things that are going to be happening June, September, October. One is my 60th birthday was in June. Second, umm… the third year anniversary of me being diagnosed with MS. It was in September and then this book that I was asked to write that I've been working on is being published next month and so there was a lot of work and a lot of pushing through and a lot of stress and I kept on thinking, my 60th birthday is coming. We planned a trip to Europe. It's, I'm just gonna get to relax then. As my 60th birthday approached, my mother who I had been taking care of ended up in hospital, so we had to cancel the European trip. So then I was thinking for my working of my anniversary with MS. I decided to participate in a three day, 50 mile challenge walk. So a lot of weekends just pushing and training and pushing through that and the fantasy is that it's going to feel so good to be at the walk and know that I did it. I did do it. It did feel so good but my partner's mother died while we were at the walk. And then we came to the book and the book, you know slogging through it. Checking over the references and that just not fun piece and the whole time my co-author and I were thinking, we're gonna have a party, we're gonna really enjoy this and my partner uh… my co-author just had a stroke. So what's been happening with me is and the book is coming out. So all these good things are happening but that piece of when this happens, I'm gonna get to relax, when this happens, I'm gonna get to let go, when this happens, I'm gonna get to celebrate hasn't happen. So I'm still in that state of feeling like I'm pushing through but there is no more pushing through. I just haven't had that release. 

00:02:50
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:02:55
PEARL WERFEL So, that's what I'm working on. 

00:02:55
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. Good. Tell us the name of your book. 

00:03:00
PEARL WERFEL It's called Multiple Sclerosis, it's part of an evidence based practice series. It's umm… supported by APA practice division. So I was asked to write it and it's, it's been a slog. 

00:03:10
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, yes. Most of them are. So umm… and you, you did turn 60, is that correct? 

00:03:15
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:03:20
CAROL KERSHAW And did you have a party? 

00:03:20
PEARL WERFEL No I didn't because instead of having the party, I was gonna go to Europe and then participating in this challenge walk. So the big party was supposed to happen after the challenge walk and the book came out. 

00:03:30
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:03:35
PEARL WERFEL And it will still happen just differently. 

00:03:35
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, yeah. So the celebration in your life is a little bit in the future, right now. 

00:03:40
PEARL WERFEL Yes and it has been. I'm looking forward to then I'm gonna celebrate then but don't know. I'm gonna celebrate then. So it's been, it's been tainted. 

00:03:50
CAROL KERSHAW Sure, sure, yeah and that's made it really difficult probably to look forward fully to that celebration. 

00:04:00
PEARL WERFEL Yes and also umm… that part of my body that thinks we're still pushing. I'm still training, I'm still slogging, it's still happening. 

00:04:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, yes. 

00:04:10
PEARL WERFEL It's just I haven't been able to settle inspite of everything because I've been telling myself this thing will mark it and you know it has, there is just one more thing that happens. 

00:04:20
CAROL KERSHAW Sure, sure. Uh… so what do you do, what are you doing now and before for relaxation or fun? 

00:04:30
PEARL WERFEL I swim. 

00:04:30
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:04:35
PEARL WERFEL I'm part of a meditation class. 

00:04:35
CAROL KERSHAW Good. 

00:04:35
PEARL WERFEL I am in a drumming class, Mediterranean drumming class in which I never practice. So I've been at a beginner rate for the last three years because it is just my joy so something I wouldn't slug through. 

00:04:50
CAROL KERSHAW Fantastic. 

00:04:50
PEARL WERFEL And umm… I do love walking and exercising and playing with my dog and being with friends. 

00:04:55
CAROL KERSHAW So you are getting to do some sense of celebration in those activities. 

00:05:00
PEARL WERFEL The self care and relaxation. 

00:05:05
CAROL KERSHAW Very good. And you're doing that regularly? 

00:05:05
PEARL WERFEL Mm-hmm. 

00:05:10
CAROL KERSHAW That's terrific. Good. So you know sometimes these developmental stages in life get in the way of our life joy and it makes it difficult especially if you've been so intense about a number of things, it is hard to kind of come to the place where you are really going to take a little time, a little bit more time for yourself and enjoy what it is you've accomplished, you know, because there is always something else, isn't there? 

00:05:40
PEARL WERFEL Yeah, then there is big something else just happened, yeah. 

00:05:45
CAROL KERSHAW And so, that reminds me of the, when I was jogging around umm… a track, there were always people ahead of me and people behind me and I never knew if I was ahead or behind. So I just imagined I was ahead. It was just a lot easier, you know. Well, umm… so what we are gonna do today is what umm… we call a deep state trance and uh… we've been uh… my husband Bill and I have been utilizing this umm… kind of a trance for uh… a while because the neuroscience research suggests there is a lot of healing that can go on by taking a person way down to the edge of sleep and letting you hover there for a little bit. So I'm gonna just talk to you and uh… let you go into a nice trance state and then I'm gonna ask you to go as deeply as possible and I'll be talking to you all the way down until the place where you hover there and then I'm gonna be very quiet for what may seem like a long time. That will be five minutes or so or longer. 

00:07:00
PEARL WERFEL Okay. 

00:07:05
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. And… 

00:07:05
PEARL WERFEL So I'm gonna get. 

00:07:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, so that would be great to get yourself situated and really balanced on both feet as you sit in that big chair. And you've already closed your eyes which is a lovely beginning of some thing different, about change that you'd like to experience. And as you slow your breathing, like you're doing right now and obviously you certainly have been in a trance before so you really do know how to allow yourself to just sink into naturally that so comfortable place. 

00:07:50
[sil.] 

00:07:55
CAROL KERSHAW That's right and as you continue going down a little more deeply. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:05
CAROL KERSHAW It's nice to know that you have this ability for self-comfort in so many avenues. No matter what's going on in your life. You're allowing yourself to continue that stabilizing rhythm, that drumming rhythm where you use your left and your right hand in synchronous fashion and that walking rhythm where you move your left side and your right side alternately. And it's very comforting. 

00:09:00
[sil.] 

00:09:05
CAROL KERSHAW And just allowing naturally this deeper state to develop for yourself. I'm going to ask you before we go further to just comfortably formulate a question in your mind you would like your unconscious to consider, giving you information about and later that answer might appear in the form of an image or word or sound, dream, symbol. But perhaps might act like an oracle for you. Speaking words of wisdom in truth to the inner part of your soul that can guide you back on the right path that you'd really like to be on. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
CAROL KERSHAW And so as you continue to go down deeper, pearl, 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:35
CAROL KERSHAW And deeper. And even deeper. 

00:10:45
[sil.] 

00:10:50
CAROL KERSHAW You might notice on your way down that possibly you pass through a really interesting place inside yourself. As your mental states begin to shift and change to something that's so much calmer and quieter. So much that more comfortable that so far down beneath, any experience of concern or anxiety or fear or that place inside yourself that tells you, you've got to keep pushing. Way down beneath all of that. 

00:11:55
[sil.] 

00:12:00
CAROL KERSHAW To an inner sanctuary if you will. 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
CAROL KERSHAW That also perhaps has an inner pool of self-compassion. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:25
CAROL KERSHAW And since you said, you like to swim, I don't know if you would like to jump in the pool or just dangle your toes in the water. But you know how refreshing water can be. 

00:12:45
[sil.] 

00:12:50
CAROL KERSHAW How you feel completely changed once you get in and you get out. How you're so refreshed. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
CAROL KERSHAW Because your mental state has shifted down to a deeper place of comfort. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:30
CAROL KERSHAW I wonder what color the water is for you. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:45
CAROL KERSHAW That's right and going down even deeper, very nice, very nice. And even deeper. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:05
CAROL KERSHAW As you know everyone passes through all kinds of mental states every evening on their way down to that wonderful state of sleep. 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:25
CAROL KERSHAW And sometimes when we get right to the edge of it, we hover there for just a little while. It's such an interesting place to be. Because your mind opens really into a field of amazing possibilities. Sometimes interesting images come to you. 

00:14:55
[sil.] 

00:15:05
CAROL KERSHAW And as you go even deeper and deeper, that's right, that's right. And maybe that you're even begin to feel that sensation of letting go. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
CAROL KERSHAW And the letting go is a celebration. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:55
CAROL KERSHAW And it's always a natural place where you don't have to push where you just allow it to happen. 

00:16:05
[sil.] 

00:16:25
CAROL KERSHAW Kind of like my, one of my most favorite places is the beach around San Diego. The water is so blue and the waves come in and go out. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:45
CAROL KERSHAW Just because of their natural rhythm and you can't hurry them up and you can't slow them down. But they are there for you to observe and notice and that's one way it crashes on the shore, it spreads itself out all over the beach and after a moment, it changes and shifts. Much of it is absorbed by the sand. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
CAROL KERSHAW And that's the way it goes. One wave after another. 

00:18:05
[sil.] 

00:18:15
CAROL KERSHAW With everything around the ocean is in a rhythm as well. And a certain frequency and as I sit here with you, my own field of electrical frequency blends with yours. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
CAROL KERSHAW And you can feel perhaps so deeply comfortable. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:00
CAROL KERSHAW So amazingly without care. As you are comfortable, the rhythm of your heartbeat. 

00:19:20
[sil.] 

00:19:25
CAROL KERSHAW Is just right and that's right. 

00:19:35
[sil.] 

00:19:50
CAROL KERSHAW And I'm going to ask you now just as you're doing so well to see if you can go even deeper. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:10
CAROL KERSHAW And deeper. 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:25
CAROL KERSHAW And all the way down to the edge. 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:40
CAROL KERSHAW Of sleep. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
CAROL KERSHAW And I'd like you to hover here with me for a few minutes without me speaking to you. So you can just really be with yourself in that quiet stillness, in the comfort of your unconscious. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:25
CAROL KERSHAW Beginning now. 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:25:05
CAROL KERSHAW And it might be interesting if you let yourself go even deeper. That's right. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:45
CAROL KERSHAW And could you be even deeper? 

00:25:50
[sil.] 

00:26:50
CAROL KERSHAW And I don't know what your unconscious might give you. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:20
CAROL KERSHAW That's right. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:28:00
CAROL KERSHAW And it might be that you feel this bubble of energy around us. 

00:28:05
[sil.] 

00:28:10
CAROL KERSHAW Rhythmic energy. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:29:00
CAROL KERSHAW And healing energy. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:40
CAROL KERSHAW And profound energy. 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
CAROL KERSHAW Touching your heart. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:35
CAROL KERSHAW Now this is a place you can go to any time. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:31:15
CAROL KERSHAW In a moment, I'm going to ask you to very slowly begin to come up just a little bit but before I do, I have the thought that I'll be in Scotland this summer and perhaps you know that old Scottish tune, my bonnie lies over the sea and bring back my bonnie to me. That's right. And it's all right. 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:10
CAROL KERSHAW That's right. 

00:32:15
[sil.] 

00:32:35
CAROL KERSHAW That's right. 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:50
CAROL KERSHAW And you can feel that and you can let it go. 

00:32:55
[sil.] 

00:33:10
CAROL KERSHAW And if you like, you can now begin very slowly coming back very, very slowly. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:30
CAROL KERSHAW Perhaps you can become aware again that your feet are on the floor. That's right, you can feel the chair, holding you back. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:55
CAROL KERSHAW And just very gently and slowly coming back here into the room, just taking care of your own rhythm as you do this, that's right, that's right. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:35
CAROL KERSHAW Very, very nice. Just slowly returning to yourself, just reconnecting. That's it. Your hands are still here, that's nice to know. Now. 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:35:15
PEARL WERFEL Make up is coming off. 

00:35:15
CAROL KERSHAW What's that? 

00:35:15
PEARL WERFEL I said, the make up is coming off. 

00:35:20
CAROL KERSHAW It's all right. It's all right. How are you doing? 

00:35:25
PEARL WERFEL Okay. 

00:35:25
CAROL KERSHAW Can you, can you talk a little bit about what happened? 

00:35:30
PEARL WERFEL Umm… the last thing, I, it just there was amazing that you said that. Umm… my middle name is Bonnie and as a child, they often because I was named after my great grandmother, they decided that Pearl was too much to give to a little girl. So I was called Bonnie as a child. 

00:35:50
CAROL KERSHAW Really? 

00:35:50
PEARL WERFEL I just start calling myself Pearl, until I was an adult. And what the part of me that's been hurt is the child. 

00:36:00
CAROL KERSHAW Wow. 

00:36:00
PEARL WERFEL So when you said that it was like yes. 

00:36:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, wow. 

00:36:05
PEARL WERFEL So that was really, I don't, I'm like amazed. A part of me was like, where did she get that from. 

00:36:10
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:10
PEARL WERFEL That was amazing. Umm… the other thing that was happening is I was seeing a rabbit and a turtle and you know the rabbit and so which is kind of the way I've been that I was looking a turtle that's lower and then, what's the, and then there was like there is got to be an animal that's neither rabbit nor turtle. Somewhere in the middle and then I realized they were both the same thing. The rabbit was rushing and the turtle was plodding. 

00:36:40
CAROL KERSHAW Oh, right. 

00:36:45
PEARL WERFEL So I didn't, I so that all had to, the so umm… there was that piece and then I was hearing tell her to stop just tell her to stop. 

00:36:55
CAROL KERSHAW Oh. 

00:37:00
PEARL WERFEL And when you said umm… the Bonnie part that was getting, that was coming from the younger part of me. 

00:37:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:37:05
PEARL WERFEL We don't want the rabbit, we don't want the turtle, can you just stop. 

00:37:10
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:37:10
PEARL WERFEL So, yeah. 

00:37:10
CAROL KERSHAW Right, wow. And can you just thought for a little while? 

00:37:20
PEARL WERFEL I can. It's that umm… it's that part of me that you know, I was helping myself coping by telling that younger part of me there is gonna be a party, there is gonna be a treat. 

00:37:30
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, yeah. 

00:37:35
PEARL WERFEL And the treat hasn't come so the little one is just agitating and angry is what I'm, is what I'm getting. 

00:37:40
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:37:40
PEARL WERFEL So yes, I can bring back that, that younger part and in different ways. 

00:37:45
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah. 

00:37:45
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:37:50
CAROL KERSHAW I hope you have many parties. And not just one you're looking for, you know. 

00:37:50
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:37:55
CAROL KERSHAW Parties along the way. 

00:37:55
PEARL WERFEL Yes, yes. 

00:38:00
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah. 

00:38:00
PEARL WERFEL So can I ask you, where did you come up with that? 

00:38:05
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… I don't know actually. Umm… but I'm gonna trance with you and umm… I have no idea well, I was thinking of going to Scotland but I thought that it's sort of a child's song and it's delightful. 

00:38:20
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:38:20
CAROL KERSHAW You know. So… 

00:38:25
PEARL WERFEL And certainly a song, I heard a lot as a child. 

00:38:25
CAROL KERSHAW That's, that's pretty amazing. 

00:38:30
PEARL WERFEL Yes, yes. 

00:38:30
CAROL KERSHAW It's very amazing. So you know, we started with on the way down asking your unconscious for some wisdom. Do you, did you get any, anything else from, from that part of you? 

00:38:50
PEARL WERFEL Umm… what came was, that wisdom was there is, there is another animal, there is another something. 

00:38:55
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, okay. 

00:38:55
PEARL WERFEL That's neither this or that umm… and when I was saying, well what is it? I was kind of getting, it will come to you like stopping the rabbit, stopping, stop being the rabbit, like get to me now. 

00:39:10
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:39:10
PEARL WERFEL So there is a wisdom that umm… there is a paradigm shift that's happening and umm… it wasn't totally being revealed to me now which is… 

00:39:20
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:39:25
PEARL WERFEL Is more realistic. 

00:39:25
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:39:25
PEARL WERFEL So umm… but I, that's what my unconscious was telling me that your, your both of your visions are to be exact same things. So you need to be shifting. You know how that shift is going to work. Well, umm… I think I'm off and on mic. How that shift is going to look will be revealed to me. Because I need to start trying to find it. 

00:39:50
CAROL KERSHAW Fantastic, fantastic. 

00:39:50
PEARL WERFEL Yes. All my attempts to trying to find it, obviously failed. So something else was going to be happening. 

00:40:00
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah. You know, it reminds me of Dr. Erickson's story of when he was really working hard on a manuscript and he sat down in a chair at his desk and he put it somewhere and then he couldn't find it. And he said, he just figured his unconscious needed time for him to sort of work out what else he wanted to say and so he took the time to do that even though his publisher was pressing him, right. 

00:40:35
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:40:35
CAROL KERSHAW And finally when he worked it all out, he sat back down in his chair, went into a trance and his hand found the manuscript again. 

00:40:45
PEARL WERFEL Wow. 

00:40:50
CAROL KERSHAW So I really like how you're going to trust your unconscious to give you the information because it absolutely will. 

00:41:00
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:41:00
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:41:00
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:41:00
CAROL KERSHAW So thanks for participating with this. 

00:41:00
PEARL WERFEL Thank you. 

00:41:05
CAROL KERSHAW Would it be all right umm… with you if umm… anybody has a question, I guess if, we'll need umm… a microphone. Do we have a microphone for audience? Is there a microphone out here for the audience? 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:41:30
[sil.] 

00:41:40
CAROL KERSHAW Thank you. So umm… maybe somebody could come and use mine, would that be? Okay, all right, oh good. Oh yeah, I'm still in a trance. Okay, anybody have a question, yes. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN And so my first question, my question is as you were guiding her, she was going into a trance but you were looking for something and you get to say (inaudible ). 

00:42:17
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:42:17
UNKNOWN What exactly were you looking for? 

00:42:20
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, so she is asking as I was guiding her into a deeper place in trance what was I looking for, for a signal. Umm… and so what happens in deep trance umm… a person's eye sometimes begin to squeeze shut and sometimes it's very subtle. You may not be able to see this on the camera but there is the rapid eye movement that begins to take place. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN The eye movement is rapid or slow? 

00:42:45
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… well, it depends, you know on the person, sometimes it's slow or sometimes it's fast. If they're, if they're looking at a dream image, sometimes it's fast. But I'm watching that shift go back and forth because just in by, as in bilateral stimulation, this is very important in the resolution of an issue, okay. And that happens to us every evening automatically which is kind of nice. Yes. Yes. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN I've read your, your preview here. Umm… that you mentioned. 

00:43:30
CAROL KERSHAW An Anandamide yes. He's asking about umm… the release of uh… neurochemical uh… called Anandamide which is a Sanskrit word for bliss, right. And this chemical is released right in as a person gets to the edge of sleep. If we had her hooked up to an EEG, her umm… theta frequency will go beta, alpha, theta, delta would become very high and this normal happens on her way down to sleep. Why is this an important thing to occur uh… because now we know from the neuroscience research with Anandamide that the, the chemical is very uh… very healing and in fact, it maybe uh… the precursor to the release of a placebo response which I don't like that word but healing response. Right, so… 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, the, the reason, it really caught my eye is umm… excuse me, I have done some work with a psychiatrist Dr. Sharma over the years and it is the first time I ever heard it mentioned. It was in his work and it was released through cannabis. 

00:44:50
CAROL KERSHAW Cannabis. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Yes, and he uh… and, and, and the reason he brought it our attention was that umm… that it could actually umm… if not, if that state, if Anandamide state isn't directed, in a positive way, it can create umm… kind of a couch potato effect because it feels so good. 

00:45:15
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, so he's saying uh… that the first time he heard about Anadamide was through a physician I guess. A psychiatrist, Shermac (ph.) umm… and uh… this is a natural chemical, it's, it's interesting, it is almost the same chemical structure as marijuana, right. So you don't have to go to California or Colorado umm… because you have to the natural ability to release that. 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:45
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. Umm… it and he was saying, you know, it does need to be directed because a person can be a couch potato because it feels so good. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:55
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… however I think in the American culture, that's probably not gonna happen because we're so driven. Uh… and this is why people seek out these drugs and why that we keep trying to find that transformative state all of us really and it's right here, it's right in your own mind, so healing. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:15
CAROL KERSHAW And you go it through into it every night when you go to sleep and you come through it every morning when you wake up. 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:25
CAROL KERSHAW It's cool, isn't it? 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Very cool. Yeah. 

00:46:30
CAROL KERSHAW Any other questions? Yes 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN She was actually releasing that chemical as you took her down? 

00:46:40
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… I'm assuming so now. We can't know that for sure unless we had her hooked up to an EEG monitor and we would see this theta cross over but I'm seeing all of the signs of it facially because I've done this work for many, many years and people have the same uh… facial uh… body sensation. You see how immobilized she got and she stayed pretty still for a very long time except the eyes were doing some movement, okay. Yes. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN So one more question, as you were watching her when she starts having the eye movement and she continues to move the head or she in the state? 

00:47:25
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, she's asking me umm… when she has eye movements and I know she's in the state yes and that's a time using this approach, I'm gonna be very quiet. Because she's doing a lot of internal work and I don't want to interfere with that. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN So you, you don't speak whenever she has before occurrence? 

00:47:45
CAROL KERSHAW Correct. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN And when they stop. 

00:47:50
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, when she has the movement, I don't speak and when she stops them, that's my signal that if I think it's appropriate, then the other communication I'm getting uh… then I might say something else right there. Yes. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN I've got a two part question. My experience has been that even with great trance when begins and I can see the client was in a right trance state. They are doing that rapid eye movement. What is the difference for you between what she did later ground and that deeper ground. Is there any physiological shift that's part of it? 

00:48:20
CAROL KERSHAW Okay, so she's asking umm… sometimes you see with light trance, the rapid eye movement which is correct. What's the difference between that and rapid. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Especially when you, like is there a different visual when she's going into deeper places? 

00:48:35
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… so there is more immobilization of the entire body when she's in a deeper trance and umm… just because that you all, I've got the uh… experience of working with people in trance also hooked up to an EEG. So I've learnt to recognize these signals. So early on in trance eye movement is usually trying to release umm… anxiety or angst or umm… unhappiness or fear whatever. And then they get to a deeper place inside. They are going into that internal sanctuary and I like to tell people, it's so true we all have this place inside, right that's deep beneath all of that anxiety. You don't live in it all the time. It's not there, in a deep place. And so yeah, so uh… as she gets more immobile and umm… quieter, there is a quietness, it's hard to describe, you probably know what I mean. There is an extra quietness about a person when she's way deep inside. I might ask you to, to umm… describe, what was that like as you got really deep? What did that feel like to you? 

00:49:50
PEARL WERFEL Well, part of what I was experiencing is the whole thing if I can't stop. So I was first observing that. 

00:49:55
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. 

00:49:55
PEARL WERFEL That I normally go into trance pretty quickly but because I've been in this keep on going state, where I was part of me was really wanting to fall into it. 

00:50:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:50:05
PEARL WERFEL A part of me kept bringing me back up. 

00:50:05
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, that's right. 

00:50:05
PEARL WERFEL And so then I would notice that you say go even deeper. 

00:50:10
CAROL KERSHAW Yes. 

00:50:10
PEARL WERFEL Because you were kind of, I think, you were feeling me going up and down. 

00:50:15
CAROL KERSHAW Yes, I was. Right. 

00:50:15
PEARL WERFEL Yeah. 

00:50:15
CAROL KERSHAW Right. And then do you feel like you got pretty far then? 

00:50:20
PEARL WERFEL And then, and then, then a part of me was just like, this is what you came here for. 

00:50:25
CAROL KERSHAW Right. just let go of it. 

00:50:25
PEARL WERFEL Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:25
CAROL KERSHAW Fantastic. That's great. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN It was a part two. 

00:50:30
CAROL KERSHAW Oh, sorry, okay. I'm sorry, go. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN So the second part is, when we meditate or when we go into deep trance, it's Anandamide happens. But when you sleep and go into realm, if there is a disturbing thing this is still realm. Does Anandamide have anything to do with that or is it only in those restorative dreams that it is released? 

00:50:55
CAROL KERSHAW Oh, that's a great question. So she's asking is Anandamide released at any other time when people are having disturbing dreams and I can't tell you whether it is not. I haven't read, found any research on that. It's, the, the research on this is very light uh… unfortunately and I'm really always in search of more of it. So please let me know if you find that. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:51:20
CAROL KERSHAW Anybody else have, yes you have a question. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN When people go to that level of deep trance, they did report to you that they are aware about that movements in their eyes and it doesn't matter in which state they are because there are some, they have to be connected with you, only one way of recognizing deeper, they do report to you that? 

00:51:55
CAROL KERSHAW Umm… okay so she's asking, I think you're asking umm… correct me if I'm wrong uh… that so when we're doing this deep trance there is this incredibly deep rapport and you're asking does the person say from time to time whether that they feel very, very connected. Most of the time, that's the case. We can ask her, how do you feel? Did you feel connected? 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN And they feel dark, I hope. 

00:52:20
CAROL KERSHAW Oh, let's ask, let's ask her if she felt the eye movement? Are you, were you aware of your eye… 

00:52:25
PEARL WERFEL I wasn't aware of the eye movement and I was, you did a really wonderful job because you wanted me to connect with me. 

00:52:35
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:52:35
PEARL WERFEL So I was aware of connecting with myself with you there as a guide. 

00:52:40
CAROL KERSHAW Right. 

00:52:40
PEARL WERFEL But not how, but not having to do the energetic work of connecting with you. 

00:52:45
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah, right. 

00:52:45
PEARL WERFEL Yes. 

00:52:45
CAROL KERSHAW Okay. Very good. Okay, good, good question, thank you. Umm… we have two minutes. Any other question, anybody have? 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:53:05
CAROL KERSHAW So he's asking umm… I was noticing her swallowing which she did a little bit umm… and what, what do I think about where she is in the trance? A lot of times that sort of movement is just a way of releasing tension, getting more comfortable and umm… you know to when you go into trance, a person has to have a certain amount of moisture in the mouth to be comfortable and that automatically happens but it will automatically happen more if you, if you do swallow and you get every aspect of yourself more comfortable. 

00:53:40
PEARL WERFEL Also my allergies are bothering me so I'm breathing through my nose. So every, I'm just… I wish it should be not through my nose and everything was coming through my mouth. So I was aware of the, at one point, I was like, I felt like I was drooling before I went down. So that was part of it too. 

00:53:55
CAROL KERSHAW Yeah. So she was just trying to get comfortable, right, yeah, yeah, okay. Well, I would really encourage you umm… to have many parties. 

00:54:10
PEARL WERFEL Thank you. 

00:54:10
CAROL KERSHAW And I'd encourage you to umm… utilize this if you find it to be helpful and uh… particularly be sure you be very respectful when a person is in that deep place and, and be quiet. So thank you all very much.
