00:00:55
Dr. Tom Sweeney COUNSELOR EDUCATOR 

00:00:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Our goal in this program will be to present how helping older persons require the same skills as with other persons, but with special insights and how you can use them effectively with this population. First, let's quickly review the basic helping skills that we know are similar when helping persons of any age. 

00:01:15
Communicate Respect 

00:01:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Common sense as well as research has demonstrated that communicating genuine respect is essential to an effective helping relationship and ultimately, personal self-exploration and growth by the counselee. For older persons, this translates very simply into effective listening and communicating skills. Biased against aging in older persons however, can block an otherwise effective counselor's ability to relate to an older person. 

00:01:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Note how the counselor shows respect by simply accepting the older person's point of view. 

00:01:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY In coming here this afternoon? 

00:01:50
 Yes, there were a lot of restaurants near. Where I live, there's no restaurant in the town. The nearest one is five miles away. 

00:02:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
 And who wants to go alone in a small town? 

00:02:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. So when you come down here, coming to the center is a way to meet people and to get out again? 

00:02:05
  Yes. There is a, a vast difference. At least here, you live in a, in a, you're just, just existing... (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:15
 ...but not, there's nothing to do if you're... (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
 ...in a small town. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
 Here, the people care. 

00:02:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Uh hmm. What are some things that could be done for older persons if we just, would get on with doing and giving? 

00:02:30
 Well, there should be activities for the weekend, something for a night, and also holiday time. Those are the worst. The families are so busy if they have children and they go on here and they're taking trips, the women all work today so they can't help it, your daughter can't help you, your daughter was gonna help the other family. (crosstalk) 

00:02:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
 So you don't have any family after you get 65 or 70, it seems. 

00:02:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:02:55
 A few, and people in the South are pretty good to be old people, but up North, huh, they're very busy and you, if you live in a rural area, you're stuck. 

00:03:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Does it leave you feeling like you're in the way? 

00:03:10
 Yes. They haven't got time for us. 

00:03:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY Researches demonstrated the importance of counselor congruence and non-possessive caring in effective helping relationships. Therefore, this is just as essential when striving to help older persons. To communicate caring involves both attitudes and skills. Accord empathy, concreteness, and immediacy can be learned through skill building. The attitudes and values, however, which will be foundation for the skills, must be learned through practical experience and introspective reflection. In the following example, the interviewer has established rapport and he's touching on issues of importance to the woman interviewee. You can see in this brief segment at least two important points. One concerns evidence of both verbal and non-verbal communication by the woman, the second, the interviewer's sensitivity to the hurt and reluctance to explore the topic at this time. 

00:04:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY  I don't wanna be personal, so if this does not... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
 It's all right. 

00:04:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY comfort you, tell me this but ah, one of the things I've noticed is ah, the uhm, handbooks on prayer and uh, you know, artifacts of spirituality and so forth. And I assume that's an important part of your life because you refer to it. Can you say something about that in terms of maybe how it supports you, encourages you, helps you in any way? (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
 It does support me. Ah, I knew that, that support is like, this is a non-denominational place and we have a band from the Baptist Church who comes to see three of us from that church. Tries one once every two weeks and he came in and brought me our old medal case. It had no pamphlets and ah, I, I called my cousin knowing this was not denominational. He wanted us to put it in the lounge, that part of the dining room and I thought it was wonderful, but uhm, when Mike came in, he reminded me and I said, "But Mike, if you look at those, there's not one word about any of them involving a church, any church and not one was published by a church group." Ah, so he said, "Well, I just don't believe it, still we can't use them." They're locked up in the room. I haven't gotten rid of them, except I gave 15 out to people in the dining room that I knew, ah, Christian people and I knew they'd read with objectivity and I say, "If you see anything and any of them which show that, show any church, any church belief, let me know." Not a one of them. They, they had titles such as loneliness, depression, and of course in going through the discussion, ah, they would use bible verses. Now, we had a man in vespers here recently. Again, I didn't get to go because of the pain but he talked on loneliness. That was his topic, "How do we handle loneliness?" and then of course he used many, many bible verses. 

00:06:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Hmm. You would like to have some other people who share that belief with you to deal with some of your own loneliness maybe, to deal with some of the times that you don't feel good yourself. Could that be? 

00:07:00
 What you mean, in other people? 

00:07:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm, some of the people who share your, your values, who share your spirituality. Would it be nice to have some people to talk to? (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
 Well, many of us do discuss things like that. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Do you? 

00:07:15
 Yeah. 

00:07:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
 Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Now I want you. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
 Not in any organized way. 

00:07:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Yeah. I feel that when you were starting to talk about that you felt badly, that there's, there's something that's not really satisfied. I don't know what it is, or there's a disappointment associated with that. 

00:07:30
 Oh(ph), I wouldn't say so in that. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY As we will see in another segment, the reluctance of many older persons to talk about their feelings and personal concerns is not unusual. Some experts believe however, that this is more a function of present generational differences. This should be less of a problem with new generations of older persons to whom counselors are no strangers. Not talking to a stranger, however, is a family value for many of our present generation of older persons. Helping them to feel comfortable with you will involve deliberate encouragement. 

00:08:00
COMMUNICATE ENCOURAGEMENT 

00:08:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Encouragement requires more than being nice or offering positive comments. To encourage is literally to give heart or to inspire another to act or behave courageously. In many instances, the counselor need only reinforce courageous thoughts and deeds. In other cases, we must confront mistaken ideas and help the person reframe a life circumstance and learn to cope with it more effectively. 

00:08:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY In the following illustrations, you can observe how the interviewers encourage the older persons with a specific reference to positive thoughts and behaviors which will sustain them in coping with changing life circumstances. 

00:08:35
MILDRED I was in the grade school, one time, ah, the girls used to come and stay all night when we was school managers(ph). And there's one girl, we had a pony. That was after I've moved and she ran into clothesline and made her eyes turn black and oh, I was really frightened then. They had to come and pick her up and take her to the doctor. 

00:09:00
 What did you do? 

00:09:00
MILDRED No, I don't know what doctor did but. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
 What did you do? 

00:09:00
MILDRED  Well, I felt real bad. I can't remember if I cried or not but I felt real bad. 

00:09:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY  You know, Mildred, one of the things that you've us by every one of your recollections is, is that you feel very deeply by the people. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
MILDRED Uh hmm. That's right. 

00:09:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY When I say you feel, you really feel inside. 

00:09:20
MILDRED Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY If ah, somebody else is hurting, you hurt with them. 

00:09:20
MILDRED That's right. 

00:09:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY  That, there, there's a heavy price sometimes that we pay for doing that, you know. When you care so much about other people, ah, you take on their burdens too. 

00:09:35
MILDRED Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY What do you do to help yourself not get down, you know, I think it won't. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
MILDRED Keep busy. 

00:09:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Keep busy? 

00:09:40
MILDRED Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Okay. What are the kinds of things you do to keep busy? 

00:09:40
MILDRED  I swim, and I dance, and I play, and I work, and cook and so on, nearly everything. 

00:09:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Okay. And all those things help to keep you up. 

00:09:50
MILDRED Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Okay. 

00:09:55
MILDRED I don't like to sit around doing anything unless I'm feeling bad. 

00:09:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY All right. 

00:09:55
MILDRED  Which I don't feel bad very often. 

00:10:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. Well, you don't let yourself get to feel bad by yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
MILDRED (inaudible ). 

00:10:07
 Also one of the things you're doing is kind of a balance sheet that this isn't so good, and that's not so good. But on the other hand, compared to some other things, I appreciate what I've got. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
 It's true. 

00:10:15
 It sounds like you're constantly doing the same thing. 

00:10:15
  You know, I'll take time if there are, I mean, I have no complaints, you know what I mean? Financially so far, we're adequate and, ah, physically, I'm doing pretty good. Emotionally, I'm doing pretty good. 

00:10:35
 And when you take your temperature, you're okay? 

00:10:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY  So now, we've briefly reviewed what may be considered some of the core conditions for helping anyone, the need to communicate respect, caring, and encouragement. You might ask what else is there? Well, the full answer to that question is a bit beyond the scope of this one program. We can get some ideas, however, by focusing on the needs which counseling can help older persons address. 

00:11:00
EXPLORE GOALS & PURPOSE FOR LIFE 

00:11:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY One of the most important needs of all older persons is to have meaning or purpose in their lives. Their dramatic examples of how some persons literally die for lack of purpose after the death of a spouse or another loved one. The loss of job or abilities to follow hobbies and other past times also leaves some persons without a will to live. You might wonder why this is at the top of our list of needs for helping older persons. Certainly, career and life planning is important for young people as well. This is true. What is also true, however, is the perception that many people hold about the goals of older persons. Rocking chairs, going fishing, watching TV, and reminiscing about the good old days are many people's image of later life. If these are your ideas, think again. In the following interviews, you will find illustrations of persons who need to find meaning for their lives and those who are making meaning for their lives. Ask yourself, what you can learn from those with strong purpose. What could you do to help those who seemed less sure? 

00:12:00
  I always said to myself, "When I get old, I won't be like that." You know, the person I'm thinking about, not now, but at that time, I, I won't be like that. I'll grow old gracefully, not by myself doing the things, or saying the things, or acting the same way, you know. 

00:12:20
 I have sold condominiums actually. Came off an old business, how I can (inaudible ). And ah, I sold my condominiums when I was about 70 years old. 

00:12:30
 That's, that's a big place. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
 Just during, during the ah, during the turn of season. I've worked from about (inaudible ). And then knock off, (crosstalk) 

00:12:37
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:37
 ...and the rest of the time, play golf. So uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY So you made your work fit this life's gust, how you handle it. (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
 Oh I just had a wonderful time. I've never will, never want to sit still. I, I want to be doing something constantly and I did and ah, so I did, I eventually liked pretty much down here. I've cripple up a little girl(ph) a few years ago but ah, ah, most things coupled with age, you can't help it. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
 Some are lucky and some are not. But, you know, I get around in here with a chair, with a lot of cars. I still drive and get around with a little walker. And where we go, people open doors for you. It makes you pretty happy, getting around pretty well. 

00:13:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY It sounds like you've maintained a good attitude over time. (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
 Well, I figured there's no other way. Why worry, there's no point of worrying because things are as we know them and there's nothing much you can do about them. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
 So, it's more wise to do what you can(ph). 

00:13:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
  As my mother used to say, "His goodness fail you never." And I can echo the same thought. It's been wonderful to be happy, and I haven't worried about things. People, I've had some hard, I was attacked, our house was broken into and I was attacked, the Lord had something for me to do because he didn't kill me. And I bounced back from that and then I had a fire here in the house and the thought I was gonna com, be completely burned down. But here, I went through the fire and got it restored a little bit and people say, "How do you keep so bright and cheerful with all those things?" So I just have a happy, I've had a happy life and I am happy because I've tried to serve the Lord and I've, I just grow, we try to grow old gracefully. 

00:14:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY I don't think you have to try; you, you're doing it. 

00:14:20
  You've said in the book, you know, my mother said and I'll say the same. The way to keep, one way to keep young is constant application of youth and that's the reason I like to have students in the house and to know what they're doing and I said, "Teach me some computer science. If I don't know computer, you're not in." 

00:14:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Our next priority for helping older persons relates to self-esteem and personal losses. As noted earlier, skills and techniques can be learned with experience and practice. Valuing persons different from ourselves; for example, ones with disabilities and those who are older, or those who are of a different race can be an even greater challenge. The inevitable loss of physical attributes so cherished in youth, the slowing down and malfunctioning of some mental processes or the loss of physical functions necessary to full independent living test the self-esteem of all persons who live long enough to experience aging. More people than ever before are subject to this test, and yet, few ever experienced all of them and none need be defeated by any of them. 

00:15:25
BUILDING SELF-ESTEEM 

00:15:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY Stated another way, one goal of the helping relationship is to build and maintain older person's positive self-concepts regardless their circumstances of health, economics, or family. Helping them to maintain independent living attitudes is as important as teaching any child to learn independent living skills. 

00:15:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY Encouragement, noted earlier as a core condition for helping others is at the heart of building positive self-esteem. Building realistic, positive self-talk is another way to express this goal. In the following excerpts, you will hear individuals of different circumstance: age, sex, marital status, share positive self statements. Recognizing that you wish to encourage others of similar circumstance to feel good about themselves, ask yourself, how can you use these comments to be more sensitive and insightful as you work with other older persons? 

00:16:20
 And I think, the, the difficulty with, with most people is giving up all those things that we've spent a lifetime gathering together, and then in the last few years, in trying to get rid of most of them. But I have two daughters who proceeded to bring big vans and, and take most of my things and that was, that was nice. I go back to see them and it's a joy to see some of my wedding things, you know, on the table and that sort of thing. And it has not been, ah, difficult for me to come here. I'm a person who, who can, can, ah, adjust very easily, really, and the people are, are, are cooperative and helpful and help me cope with a lot of little things that happen. But I'm happy I won't miss many things. 

00:17:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY That's great. 

00:17:10
 I think today's world is showing this. I think they have a little more difficulty. I remember my husband and I, ah, uhm, at Teachers' College Convent. Our salaries were exactly 300 dollars apart, in my teaching and his teaching. And, ah, but then when I got down to Florida, which was later, we didn't have the trouble. His was far ahead of mine. He was on the university staff and I was in public schools, but I married a man who was certainly not chauvinistic and I've had, we're on our 54th year, and I have no feelings about men in any other way, but, ah, great respect and it's a matter of, of mutual respect and concern, I think. And I've, I'm, I'm the only one here who's married and has children so, in this particular threesome, so I wanted to talk for that. 

00:18:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Did you retire from working because of the injury then? 

00:18:10
 Oh, no, I didn't retire from that. I just felt like I had made enough time when to see to, you know, retire. 

00:18:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Okay. 

00:18:20
 Because I've worked 26(ph) years and that's enough. 

00:18:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY Well, why, why didn't you start picking up the broom and doing some other work? 

00:18:25
 Well, on account that I was trying to keep myself together. (inaudible ) I have, gotta been here. 

00:18:32
DR. TOM SWEENEY  And so why you figure you're gonna be just decay than if you just. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
 That's right. And I say, no, (inaudible ) got stiff, and that would've been here. 

00:18:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
 Well, that would make it, that's a first, they don't get up (inaudible ). And then you get stiffed, and that's all for him, gotta authorize him everything yet. 

00:18:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Do you have any health problems? 

00:18:50
 Oh boy, I've got good health. Yeah. 

00:18:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY So you don't take any medicines or anything? 

00:18:55
 I haven't take no medicine in a long, long time. 

00:19:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY Are you okay? 

00:19:00
 Yeah. 

00:19:00
DR. TOM SWEENEY But tell me, how is life different from you, for you now, say, compared to when you were 50? 

00:19:05
 Oh, life is better now than it was when I was 50. 

00:19:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY Oh. Why do you say that? 

00:19:10
 Well, I don't have to (inaudible ) at all and then, I get some money. Then, if I feel like going home, sitting down, I can loosen down. 

00:19:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY  So you really have more freedom now? 

00:19:25
 I got more freedom. 

00:19:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY You don't have to be out there... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
 Nope. 

00:19:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY  nine to five or eight to five, (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
 Nope. 

00:19:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY whatever on a... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
 Nope. 

00:19:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY ...Monday through Friday, and ah. (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
  Nope. 

00:19:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY Uh-huh. So, you work as much as you wanna work? 

00:19:35
 I work as much as I wanna work. This is like four hours a day, so I can make that, then go home and do something else (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:19:46
DR. TOM SWEENEY Come in at noon time or leave the desk, sounds like makers hours. 

00:19:46
 Gotta be (inaudible ) and fly(ph). 

00:19:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Before concluding this program on the helping relationship, a brief discussion of some differences which some older persons will present to you seem necessary. Based upon either research or practice, the following represent special considerations when working with older persons. 

00:20:05
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS 

00:20:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Due to hearing and vision impairments you may need to be more deliberate in your communication methods. You can show respect and encouragement to your client by compensating for their impairment with patience, perseverance, and sensitivity. Not all older persons have these impairments, speaking more slowly and enunciating can be sufficient in some cases, while others may require speaking more loudly. Speaking slowly and loudly to all older persons will be perceived as disrespectful and not very smart. 

00:20:35
GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES 

00:20:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY If you're a young person, you may be at a disadvantage in attempting to establish trust with some older persons. This may be because of your unknown prejudice or theirs. If you find yourself having some doubt about either or both, seek consultation with a supervisor or a trusted colleague. In either case, it can be a learning experience for both you and the counselee. 

00:20:55
LEARN FROM MISTAKES 

00:20:55
DR. TOM SWEENEY It is an opportunity from which to learn. If it is threatening to be potentially ineffective, ask yourself, who said you had to be effective with everyone anyway? In many cases, it is as simple as being more aware of your language. For example, slang, or swearing, or the clothes you wear, casual versus business clothes. 

00:21:15
DR. TOM SWEENEY Distractors are of two types: those to you and those to the older client. 

00:21:20
Distractors for You Client Impairments 

00:21:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY You may find it difficult to establish rapport because of the physical impairments mentioned earlier. 

00:21:25
Lack of Vocabulary 

00:21:25
DR. TOM SWEENEY You also may find that the older persons lack of vocabulary or feeling words to express themselves. 

00:21:30
Authority Role 

00:21:30
DR. TOM SWEENEY Others may see you in an authoritative role and comply in passive sorts of ways, contrary to your goals. Any of these may undermine your confidence or resolve to be helpful. 

00:21:40
Distractors for Client Title of Activity 

00:21:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Distractors to the older person can include what you would call what you do. Many older persons will join support, personal growth or sharing groups, but would never think of volunteering for a counseling group. The physical setting is important too. Sometimes due to disabilities, sometimes due to poor circulation or other health-related conditions. 

00:22:05
Proper Seating 

00:22:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY Having straight-back chairs, not cushions on the floor. 

00:22:05
Quiet Room 

00:22:05
DR. TOM SWEENEY  A quiet area free from loud, heating, and air-conditioning motors or street sounds and in a brightly-lighted area significantly affect participation in a support group. While on these conditions- 

00:22:20
Comfortable Temperature 

00:22:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY - the topic room temperature is worth mentioning. Many older clients are very sensitive to cold and require adequate clothing and room heat. Overlooking these conditions is like going to bat with at least three strikes against you. You also may want to provide refreshments after the meeting. The opportunity to relax and socialize can provide an added dimension of comfort among the older group members.

DR. TOM SWEENEY  As the materials in the accompanying curriculum guide indicate, there are techniques specifically suited to working with older persons. Some of these will be presented in other of this supplemental video series, including the one on working with groups. Through this program, we hope that you can now see more clearly that there are many similarities in the helping relationship with all persons, including those who are older. Likewise, we hope that some of the differences in assisting older persons have become more apparent. As you continue your studies, you will no doubt come to appreciate the similarities and differences even more.
