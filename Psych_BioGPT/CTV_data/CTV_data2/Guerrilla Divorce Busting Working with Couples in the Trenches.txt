MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Unfortunately, I always have to lower the mic. Can you see me? Can you hear me? I can see you and I've noticed something interesting about the constitution of the group. Did anybody notice that there are like 90% women in this group. Where are the guys? Okay, there are few of you. Well, I've decided to just focus on the fact on who is here rather than who is not here because the class is either half empty or half full. Did you get -- you didn't hear, the class is either half empty or half full. Do not laugh. Not a good sign. Okay. Alright, so, but you can hear me okay, right? Alright, let me know if that changes? So I want to start my talk today with a story, something that just happened a couple of weeks ago. I was on a flight from Chicago to Denver and a man was seated next to me. We started to talk as seat mates often do, you know, where you going? Are you going home? or are you going to work? and he told me that he worked for a big company. He was very successful. He travelled extensively and then he asked me what I did and I told him I was a marriage therapist. Can you imagine what happened for the next two hours? Has it happened to you? Listen, I do some of my best work on airplanes. This man, I'll call him Ron. Well he started to tell me about his marriage. His wife perplexed him. He worked hard. They lived in a beautiful home and she was able to be a stay-at-home mom and since both their children were in school, he told me she could do anything she wanted with her time. He encouraged her to go out with other people and enjoy her life but for some strange reason, she didn't seem happy. So, I asked whether she had ever talked about missing him during his long absences with his travel and he said yes, she complains all the time but I don't think that's really the issue. I think she's just an unhappy person. I think she's insecure. I could see I had my work cut out for me. I had two hours to get through to this guy. I asked if he ever in all of their discussions, agreed or validated her point of view and he told me no. I don't understand it and I don't want to encourage her bad attitude and then he wondered why they weren't having sex. In fact, to further his case, Ron told me about a recent event that made him feel like giving up on his marriage. It was his wife's birthday and although they had been quite distant emotionally, he decided to extend the olive branch and buy her a bouquet of roses. He left them on the dining room table to surprise her. When he returned he was hoping to find a softened, grateful wife. Instead, she was angry. You know that I think buying flowers is a waste of money. I told you this a million times, you never listen to me. You just don't get it and I am really upset. As he told me this story, he turned his head to look out the window and when he turned back to me, I understood why. He was crying. He felt crushed. He looked at me as if to say, do you see what I mean. This was a defining moment. I had a choice. I could've criticized his wife for not being appreciative of his efforts to re-connect, re-enforcing his belief that she was just a miserable soul or I could focus on what I saw was an emerging theme. This woman didn't feel heard. She felt invisible. She had told him many times about her not wanting flowers, yet he bought her flowers. Each time he told her that she should be happy because she had all the freedom in the world to do whatever she wanted to do, to go wherever she wanted to go, to be with the people she wanted to be with. All of this was a painful reminder that he was missing the point. Ron, I said. She doesn't want those things. She wants you. She misses you. She needs you. We talked a few more minutes and then right before we landed, he said to me. Michele, I really need to work on my marriage, can you help us find a therapist in Chicago. Not a moment too soon because our session had ended. Listen, they don't call it the friendly skies for nothing or I recall another time when I met a woman on a hike in Boulder, Colorado where I live. I do some of my best work on hikes. I won't bore with you all the details but I'll tell you that she was walking close behind me and I struck up a conversation with her as I often do and after a brief exchange about how long she lived in Boulder and what she did for a living, she told me that she was hiking to get away from her husband because she was, in her words, so pissed off at him, she could hardly stand him. In fact, she said, that when I stormed out of the house, we exchanged mutual F U's. Then she turned to me and said, what do you do in Boulder, Michele? I said I'm a marriage therapist. I wrote a book called Divorce Busting and we both cracked up. Turns out she was very curious about my work and I told her about my passion for helping couples make their marriages more loving. We talked through the entire hike and I encouraged her to put aside her ego and handle her husband differently and by the end of the hike, we were fast friends and we exchanged our phone numbers. She called the following week and told me that when she got home, she and her husband had the best conversation they've had in a long time. I just love that. You know, maybe next time they fight, instead of exchanging indecencies, her husband will just shout "Why don't you just take a hike". So, I know that each and every one of you sitting here today has a comparable story about impact in someone's life after hours. It might be a family member, a friend, or even a complete stranger. That's because we are passionate about helping people have loving relationships and we're passionate for a reason. Have you ever stopped and asked yourself why you do what you do? Is there anyone sitting here who chose to work with couples because you couldn't think of anything else to do? Was it simply a random choice. I suspect not. We're all here for a very good reason. Something happened in your life or in the lives of people you love that influenced your career choice. Your life experiences have worked you in particular ways and those experiences have everything to do with not only your decision to work with couples but what you actually do when you work with them. You make choices every moment from the moment you meet them to every subsequent moment after and our choices like mine with Ron or my hiking buddy whether or not we admit it, we like it or recognize it greatly impacts our clients choices about their marriages. Couples come to us in their darkest hours and share the stories of their lives. We are not just passive listeners, gathering information objectively. There is no such thing. Scientists in all fields know that you can't observe data without influencing it. No, we influence by channeling the therapeutic conversation in very distinct ways. We pay attention to certain aspects of what couples talk about and we ignore the rest. We ask leading questions that stem from our presuppositions and values about life and how people change. Have you ever noticed that for some very strange reason, clients of behavioral therapists end up with behavioral problems or that clients of cognitive therapists have cognitive distortions or that psychoanalytic clients have very revealing dreams and deeply repressed childhood memories. It is without question that we are co-authors in the stories people tell about themselves and then on the basis of what they say, they make decisions about their lives. There is saying that summarizes this process and it goes something like this. Let me see what I say so I know what I think. Let me see what I say so I know what I think. So, since we play such an integral role in what happens in couples lives, we better be clear about our biases and before I ask you to think about your particular band of brought biases, I want to tell you about mine. I have a confession. I'm an unabashed marriage saver. I believe that most marriages can and should be saved and I haven't gotten here due to religious or moralistic beliefs. I'm a divorce buster because I've just come to believe that most of the marital problems that couples are experiencing when they are considering divorce are solvable. It's not that I'm against divorce per se, it's just that I'm against unnecessary divorce. Even in my practice, which focuses primarily on flat lined relationships, marriages where infidelity is rampant, divorce or separation is already in the works or the most common pattern where one person desperately wants in and the other person just as desperately wants out. Even then, I generally believe that divorce is not the solution but the truth is, I didn't always think that way. Here's what changed my mind. When I started my career, I was a family therapist. When couples had problems, I did what I could to help them resolve the issues at hand and that didn't work always and when it didn't, I just assumed they really weren't invested in making their marriages work. So, I helped them dissolve their relationships as therapeutically and as collaboratively as possible. I offered them tools and techniques for gently breaking the news to the kids and helping them deal with their pain and then getting on with the business of moving forward in their lives and becoming effective co-parents, but over time, I saw the toll that divorce took on families particularly on children who had no vote in the decision that would affect them forever. I saw parents who believed that divorce would end their many parenting battles only to discover the real bitterness that divorce can bring. I figured out quickly that Carl Whitaker had it right when he said: "When children are involved, there is no such thing as divorce". Gradually, I came to the conclusion that divorce is not a panacea even in cases where the adults benefited from their fresh start contrary to conventional wisdom at the time which suggested that if parents do better, the kids will also do better. Research taught us that there didn't seem to be this trickledown effect. Rather than tending to the needs of their children and their changing families, parents were often pre-occupied with getting their own lives back on track. I also observed that except in extreme situations, most kids really want their parents together. Kids really don't care if their parents marriage has no passion or if they're boring. They just want their mom and their dad together to tuck them in bed at night. So that professional experience was part of the reason that I became a marriage saving die hard but what's the real reason? By the way, I attended a week-long workshop on Mindfulness with Jon Kabat-Zinn. How many people are familiar with Jon Kabat-Zinn raise your had? Many of you are and he started out by asking participants the reason that they were attending the workshop and after several responses from the crowd, he asked and why did you really come to this workshop and after a smattering of deeper more personal explanations, the peoples attendance he asked and why did you really really come to this workshop. So this is why I'm really really here. I grew up in an East Coast version of the Walton family. I had two parents who adored me and they never ever fought. I have two brothers with whom I did fight but love endlessly, one of whom is sitting right over there. I had lots of close friends, a wonderful close extended family and many many warm family memories of holidays and trips together. I loved my childhood. Things felt nearly perfect. That is until one day during my senior year in high school when my mother called us in for a family meeting and family meetings, impromptu family meetings were not the norm in my family, so I suspected that something was up. My mother proceeded to tell us that she had been unhappy in her marriage for 23 years, that she had tried counseling but it hadn't worked and the therapist suggested that she leave the marriage and go find herself. I would like to go find the therapist. I remember the words my mother used to tell us that their marriage was over. There comes a time in life when you just have to throw in the towel. Those words changed my life immeasurably. I was leaving for college and my parents marriage was ending but what I didn't know was that not only would my parents marriage end but my family as I knew it, my nest would be gone forever. You see, my mother like so many women had been the hub of the family wheel and when she resigned from that position, no one stepped up to the plate to take over. I also learned that divorce isn't something that just happens and it's over, it's something that happens over and over and over. There are reminders throughout the years when my own children were born, at birthday parties, weddings, religious celebrations, holidays, funerals, and so on. Even after all these years, the awkwardness of infrequent family gatherings remains a source of pain. I tell you this not to confess my ineptitude at letting go of the past or in the hopes that many of you will line up after my talk and offer me your services so I can move on with my life although maybe I'll be open to that. I tell you this because these feelings have greatly influenced my life in positive ways as well. They made me the divorce buster that I am. For starters, I've been determined to make my own marriage work and keep my family together. I consider my 40-year relationship with my husband Jim to be one of my biggest accomplishments and I tell people that if you knew him, you'd know what an accomplishment that really is. Long-term marriage folks is hard. We just became grandparents and I'm thrilled that we can enjoy our little granddaughter together. Plus Jim always tells me that if we ever got divorced, it'll be really bad for book sales. Seriously, this is somewhat comforting. I've heard it said that the first 50 years of marriage are the hardest. We have only 10 more to go. My feelings about my parents divorce also flamed my passion to help others, not just save their marriages but rather to divorce their old marriages and start new ones with their same partners. I developed an approach aimed at encouraging couples to fight for their marriages rather than get out. I named the approach divorce busting. I was greatly influenced by the work of the late Steve de Shazer. How many people are familiar with Steve's work? True to its Ericksonian roots, divorce busting is a strength spaced goal and future oriented approach. I stopped being fascinated in why couples were struggling and I focused more on what they could do to fall back in love. I developed strategies both direct and subtle that really forced couples to rethink their unhelpful certainties about themselves, each other, and the viability of their marriages. I made a promise to myself that I would view my practice as a work-in-progress always paying close attention to what worked, what motivated couples to reconcile and what didn't so that I could build on what was effective and eliminate the rest. So, the more I practice this approach, the more couples chose to stay together. The more they remained together, the more I came to believe that there is no such thing as a marriage that's dead on arrival. If they were sitting in my office, there was a shred of hope. With every couple, my default position became, this marriage can be saved. I wasn't always right about that but I learned an important lesson and here is what I learned. You know, it isn't the differences in backgrounds, values, beliefs that ultimately divide couples. It's when one or both spouses become hopeless. That's when they throw in the towel. Hopelessness is the real cancer in marriage. Good therapy, regardless of your theoretical orientation must instill hope. Good therapists are hope mongers. I believe that its our role to help couples leave no stone unturned enabling them to consider new more optimistic possibilities and the great news is that we are in the front lines when it comes to couples struggling to stay afloat. Now when I say that we're in the front lines, you're probably thinking about your role as therapists. I've other plans for you. Although I'm going to touch on things that you can do in your therapy office to help stack the deck in the favor of marriage, that's not what this talk is about today. Why? Do you know that the vast majority of people who divorce, do so without ever consulting a therapist. They're much more likely to consult with their friends, their family members, acquaintances, people in the neighborhood, churches, synagogues, their bartenders, their hairdressers, their family doctors, tea leaf readers, and even Dr. Phil. Many of our societies real change agents don't have framed certificates hanging on the wall and although those of you sitting here are without question, the crème de la crème of the professional elite, that's only one of the hats you wear. You're also a friend. You're a neighbor, you're a relative. A person overhearing a conversation in a waiting room or on line in a grocery store and it's there on the street, on an airplane, on a hike or even your random conversation at a PTA meeting where you might have your best chance of influencing someone teetering on the brink of divorce and encouraging them to stay the course. It's there that you can become a guerilla divorce buster. Now, if the term guerilla divorce busting sounds unfamiliar, perhaps guerilla warfare rings a bell. Guerilla fighters are small groups of people, fiercely devoted to their principles and use unconventional means in unconventional places to wage war against larger, more powerful forces. They are creative, they are flexible, and they are tenacious and in the case of marriage, what might be the larger force. Well, as an example, do you remember a study that hit the media in a very big way a few years ago positing that divorce is contagious. Raise your hands if you remember that study? Not too many people. Anyway, here's what one reporter wrote. "Researchers have discovered that divorce is catching and spreads like a disease through families, workplaces, and groups of friends. The domino effect means that if an immediate friend or colleague splits up, your own chance of divorce increases by 75%. Even the breakup of a friend of a friends marriage boosts your chances of divorce by a third" scientists say. Now that study got a lot of play. Okay friends, no rocket science here. We're social animals. What we do, think, feel, and say affects others. There's a ripple effect but since this is true, why not capitalize on the dynamic in the opposite direction. Why not be the source of a marriage saving epidemic and why not do it everywhere we go. A veritable marriage strengthening life transforming office without walls. This whole idea about impacting people's lives outside our therapy offices got me thinking about times in my own life when someone influenced me in very profound ways during a casual conversation and I know if you think about it, you can conjure up images of people who have touched your life similarly. For me, one such transformation occurred many years ago with a man who happened to be one of my professors at graduate school. I was his research assistant for the summer and every day I'd go into his office and help him compile data. One day, I was in a funk and he noticed that I wasn't my usual sunny self. He asked me what was wrong. I was learning a great deal about family therapy and how families work and suddenly I found myself analyzing everything and scrutinizing the relationships of everyone in my family. I started to feel sad and disoriented. My professor, by the way when you take an abnormal psych class, don't you have every symptom of every diagnostic and well that was what was happening to me too. My professor suggested that we put our work aside and talk. I explained to him that up until that point in my life and I think I was in my mid-20s at the time. I'd always thought that I had the near perfect family but now I was questioning that reality. My relationship with my mother was always extremely close. We talked about everything. And by the way, my mother was a therapist. So I'm an adult child of a therapist. In some ways, we were, my mom and I were more like friends than mother and daughter. My father was very different. He was very focused on his work and unlike my mother, we rarely had open conversations about my life. For most of my childhood, I'd just assumed that this is the way fathers are and I didn't think much of it but now I kept having this nagging thought that my father had failed me somehow and that I should have had a closer relationship with my dad more like the one that I had with my mom. This new awareness made me feel as if a rug had been pulled from beneath my feet. I was really sad. My professor sat quietly as I shared with him my revelation about my father and my feelings of loss and when I was through, he spoke and his words impacted my life in ways he'll never know. He could've responded the way some therapists do by acknowledging my pain, commenting on my father's inadequacies or fears of connection, exploring the impact an emotionally absent father has on his daughter but he did none of that. Instead, he helped me to step back and look at my family from a broader, more systemic perspective. We talked more about how my mother and I had such an intense closeness, a closeness which undoubtedly a blessing in my life also left little room for my father's involvement. I never thought about it that way before. We talked about my father's dedication to work not as a deficit but as a source of pride. He pointed out and rightfully so, my father's fierce determination to provide well for his family and offer my brothers and me all the opportunities he, a holocaust survivor never had, and before our talk ended, he asked me to think about the unique ways my father showed his love to me, ways that although different from my mom's were nevertheless heartfelt. I sat quietly for a moment and became deluged with poignant sweet memories. I recalled my father teaching me to ride a bike and my feeling of exhilaration when just at the right moment he let go or the times he took me skiing and when it was too cold for me to take off my mittens to fix my ski's, my father always came to my rescue. I remember thinking that he seems so strong and so protective and so impervious to the cold and then there was Sunday mornings when I would play the piano in our family room and my father would sit for hours just listening. No, we didn't talk about the details of my life like I did with my mother but my father's love and devotion to me was indisputable. Thanks to my professor and the choices he made that day, I left with my father-daughter relationship intact. Plus, I learned an invaluable lesson that when it comes to relationships or anything else in life for that matter, it's important to focus on what I have rather than what I don't have. I need to cherish who people are and what people bring to relationships rather than what they can't or don't offer and in many ways, I think this is key to making relationships work and being happy, gratitude for what it is. So, I got to thinking some more. What if everyone looked at day-to-day conversations with people’s opportunity to infuse their lives with enthusiasm for strengthening relationships and being more accepting and loving and forgiving? What if we truly took to heart the responsibility we all have to intervene in the phase of ignorance, hopelessness or self-centeredness and to do what we can to plant seeds of possibility and optimism, imagine what we could do. I’m going to share with you a couple of guerilla divorce busting tactics that you can use with anyone, your spouse, your friends, the person sitting next to you with this conference, any unsuspecting person is their game. I’m not going to ask you to turn to the person next to you. Take a deep breath. So, guerilla divorce busting tactic number one, don’t be a friend. Many of us have had the experience of having close friends or family turned to us when their marriages are on the rots. Sometimes, it’s the spouse who is unhappy and maybe considering leaving. Other times, it’s the person who desperately wants the marriage to be saved, but the other spouse is half way out the door. So, let’s start with the people who desperately want to save their marriages when their spouses want out. They may be separated or an affair may be looming. Sometimes, even though we believe in marriage, it’s hard for us to watch our friends suffer, especially if we think the handwriting is on the wall, like the marriage is over. Out of concern, we urge our friends to move forward with their lives, but really, is advice such as that really in our friend’s best interest or are we just trying to protect ourselves? Let me introduce you to Benny, a women whose 25-year marriage ended with one swift phone call when her husband was out of town on business. Benny talks about how her friends have reacted to her fierce determination to make her marriage work and these are Benny’s words, Michele, my friends are really good, but they are thinking about what’s going to hurt me the least. I can just tell, because when I talk to them, they tell me, he’s an asshole, you are the best thing ever happened to him. She goes on to say, I have friends that are guys and one of them is an attorney, he’s great, he’s like, Benny, listen, anyone would be glad to have you out there, I’d be happy to hook you up with someone; your husband is going to be sorry he ever left you. Then she pauses and looks down and she starts to cry and tells me, Sunday, I cried the whole day, but I couldn’t call anyone, because whoever I called, they’re going to come over and say, you got to get over this, you’re a great person, you got to move on with your life, you’ll do great out there. And through her tears, she said, even though I was hurting really bad and I was crying and crying and crying and saying to God, I don’t deserve this, I don’t want this to be happening to me. I couldn’t pick up the phone and call anyone for relief, because I knew what they would say. Nobody said to me you are right in fighting, you should fight for your marriage. I know they’re my friends, but this past week, they just said, kick him to the curb, get a lawyer, get all the money you can. Do you know what a great settlement you get? You wouldn’t even have to work. For me, it’s not about money. That’s not going to make a bit of difference. I can have all the money in the world and that’s not going to matter. It’s about me and it’s about knowing that I’ve really tried hard enough. I’ve got to know that about myself. So, for those of you who have friends who desperately want to save their marriages, even if you friends are deeply pained and even if you think they’ve been wrong, then the reconciliation is unlikely, support them in their fight for their marriage until it works or until they’ve decided that they’re ready to move on. What about people who are unhappy in their marriages? How do you respond to them? Too often we allow our love or friendship with a person to stand in the way of good advice. We want to be a shoulder to lean on. We empathize, we sympathize, we feel protective, we find ourselves blaming the absent spouse. We say, I can see why you feel that way, what in the world is your husband thinking or what’s up with your wife, she is being such an add. For diagnosing the absent spouse is biased and it’s short-sighted and it will only lead to elaborate the blame and counter-blame when your friends get home. You know, Sinbad, the comedian, once said that if my wife watches Oprah in the morning, I know I’m in trouble in the afternoon. Besides all of you know that it’s foolhardy to diagnose the absent spouse from a professional standpoint. Have you ever had the experience of working with one spouse who talks about the marriage and the ways he or she -- he or she has been short changed and without realizing it, you begin to form a negative opinion about the spouse. And then that spouse wants to join you in therapy and you meet him or her for the first time and low and behold that person is like nothing like you expected, I mean totally different, how many people have had that experience? All of you have, I know I have also. Anyway to the extent that we’re merely mirroring back what our friends are thinking and feeling, sure they’ll leave vindicated and validated, but they’ll leave our conversation without a clue about what to do next. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with a good dose of old fashioned empathy. After all, it’s important that our friends feel hurt, but the point is don’t get stuck there. Here is what we should do instead. We need to challenge our friends. We need to make sure that they don’t leave our sides until they recognize that if they’re unhappy in their marriages, they have to do something to fix it, even if they think they’re dead right, what they’re doing isn’t working and it’s making them miserable. So, be directive, urge people to stretch outside their comfort zones. For example, if someone complains that her husband doesn’t help around the house and he neglects her emotionally, ask her, when your husband shirks his responsibilities and you don’t feel important to him, how do you handle it? What do you do? What do you say? And when she tells you that her words fall upon deaf years, don’t stop nudging her. Ask her what else she has tried. And then what? Brainstorm new possibilities together. You see, the goal is to get people to quit feeling self-righteous or self-pity and help them to become solution detectives to focus on what works, what they can do and what they should do to make things better. Don’t let your friends off the hook. Guerrilla divorce busting tactic number two, spread the word about the Walkaway Wife Syndrome. Did you know that of the over 1 million marriages that will end in divorce this year, two-thirds of those divorces will be filed for by women? What is the Walkaway Wife Syndrome all about? Well, in the early years of marriage, I really believed that it’s primarily women who are the relationship caretakers. We’re the ones looking at our love watches. Have we talked enough, have we spent enough time together? And if the answer is yes, then all is right in the world. If the answer is no, she will pursue her husband for more time together and more intimate conversation. If he doesn’t respond at that point, what tends to happen is her complaints will no longer be confined to the time and -- time together and talking issue. They spill over into everything else in their lives. You’re a slob around the house, I feel like I’m missing good parents, you’re not a good father. Now look, I’ve never met a women -- a man rather, who when his wife complains, he wants to spend more time with her. So, he joins another gulf league. He spends more time at work. He spends more time with his buddies. And it’s at that point, the woman decides that she is getting out of the marriage and she plans her exit strategy. Now, for every woman, her exit strategy is a little bit different, but it often takes months or years in its implementation. For some women, it’s when the youngest graduates from high school. For other women, it’s when she gets a better job, so she can support herself. For other women, it’s when she meets another man and during that time, she is no longer fighting for the marriage and she is no longer complaining. But then D-Day comes and she turns to her husband and she says, I want a divorce and in unison, I want to everyone to tell me what he says in return. Why? I had no idea you weren’t happy, why didn’t you tell me? Those words nail the marital coffin shut. She cannot fathom how he doesn’t know why she is unhappy, because she knows that she has done everything. And by the way, when a woman says that she has done everything, what it really means is that she has said everything, because most women rely too heavily on words to get through to their husbands, but that’s a whole other story. So, here is the real tragedy. This is when these men and I know you’ve seen them in your practice, for the first time in their lives, recognize the importance of their marriages and they’re willing to do anything to keep their families together. They buy every self-help book known to mankind. They schedule counseling sessions and marriage seminars by themselves if they have to. They go back to church and synagogue. They even start talking about their feelings with male friends. They become absolutely positively transformed. They get more involved with their children. They do more around the house. They’ve turned into the husbands that these women have been wishing for. These are not band aid changes. They’re not temporary changes. These are real and lasting changes, because the men like themselves better this way, but the problem is that it’s often too late. Walkaway wives have had impenetrable walls that have shielded them from pain for years and now this wall prevents them from truly recognizing their husband’s genuine willingness of a change. They’ll say too little, too late, you’re just trying to manipulate me or if I give you another chance, you’ll just go back to your old ways. So, what’s the guerilla divorce buster to do? Well, first of all, please impress upon all of your type A male friends about the importance of spending time with their wives. There is no substitute for meaningful time together. And by the way, taking marriage for granted isn’t just a guy thing. Many women fall into the trap of not spending time with their husbands, particularly when the children are young. They stop going on dates. They stop being physically affectionate and men feel abandoned, but that’s another story too. The point is I truly believe that if more couples understood the importance of time together, we all would be out of a job. But more importantly, if you run into a man whose wife is about to walk away, you have got a real customer on your hands. Teach him what I refer to in my books as the last resort technique. Of all the tools that I offer couples in my books, this one undoubtedly has had the best success in Eleventh Hour marriages. Because he is afraid of losing his wife, he does what any intelligent human being would do. He chases, he clings, he sends flowers, he writes love notes, he begs, he pleads, I know you’ve seen all of this. Although it seems counterintuitive, insist that he take a deep breath and give his wife some space; tell him to stop asking for reassurances and showering her with I love you’s; tell him to quit being a dud in her presence, he needs to get a life and stop looking like such a sorry sight; remind him that it’s not very attractive, I hope you have a good relationship with your clients; encourage him to keep up his new and improved behavior as a husband and a father, even if his wife doesn’t thank him for it; and above all, tell him to be patient. Here’s a letter from a man, who followed this advice and it paid off. My wife asked me to leave about three months ago. She said it was over and that she wasn’t in love with me and that we were never getting back together. I’ve been married for seven years and together for ten. We have two girls, ages three and six. My wife was cold and angry, could hardly look at me. She stopped wearing her wedding ring, which meant so much to her when we got married. She refused to go to counseling or even talk to us. I was a mess, I cried, I couldn’t concentrate at work. I lost 35 pounds. I couldn’t sleep. I begged, I reasoned with her and nothing works. At the beginning, she said she needed time. This was the hardest thing to do. I remember the doom and gloom feeling of not talking to her, how I wanted to pick up the phone and just hear her voice. I thought about losing her in the whole situation almost 24 hours a day, it was a living hell, but after learning the last resort technique, I soon realized that I had to give her time and I had to be her friend. I laid off the calls and surprisingly, she started to call me. I started to sound happy and in return she started to sound happier too. When she realized that I wasn’t going to pressure her about the relationship, she felt more at ease with me. Slowly things started to change. We spent a little time each week together with the kids, with no pressure, no trying to hold her hand, no trying to kiss or hug her. Eventually, she started giving me a little hug. She squeezed my hand when I left and called me dear or honey on the phone. I know we still have work to do on our relationship, but last night, she asked me to move back home. Look, the last resort technique doesn’t always lead to reconciliation, but it always helps people feel better about themselves and feel more in control of their lives, both of which are imperative no matter what. And finally, guerilla divorce busting tactic number three, be a hope monger. When I think about ways of spreading hope, I can’t help think of a man named Dr. Bernie Siegel. How many people are familiar with Dr. Siegel’s work? Most of you are. I assume many of you have heard of him, he is a surgeon working with cancer patients, who came to believe that people in his medical practice were more than just embodiments of their illnesses and symptoms. They were people with hearts and souls with rich histories and despite often dire diagnosis, promising futures. He felt blessed by the many patients he encountered, who despite their prognosis absolutely refused to allow their illnesses to truncate their lives. These patients change their lifestyles. They slow down. They smell the roses. They loved more and followed whatever healing pass they’re intuitions guided them to. Bernie Siegel developed enormous respect for the innate healing power within and because of this he stepped down from the physician’s pedestal that separates doctors from the people they treat. He collaborated rather than lectured. He hugs and talks freely about feelings regarding people’s triumphs and their failures, rather than hide behind a cloak of professionalism and most of all, he planted positive powerful suggestions about healing with each and every one of his patients. He never ever predicated how long patients might live beyond their diagnosis. He considered that unethical, because he realized that people aren’t statistics. He also took issue with the way in which doctors tell patients about possible side effects of treatment. He worried about people susceptibility and how receiving a long list of possible reactions to treatment might actually bring about the very conditions listing. As Bernie became more human with his patients and believed more and more in the healing power of humanity rather than technical tools, he noticed a strange coincidence. An increasing number of his patients became well. Bernie’s colleagues didn’t how to appreciate his optimism. In fact, a doctor once said to him, don’t you ever worry about creating false hope in your patients? To which he replied, I worry more about and still enforce to spare. I just love that Bernie Siegel. You know, I can’t remember whether this is a Bernie Siegel or a Norman Cousins’ story, but it really doesn’t matter, a woman in her mid-80s was being interviewed by a writer, because she was somewhat of a medical mystery. When she was 40 years old, she got very ill and was told by a doctor that she had only six months to live. The interviewer said, wow, hearing that must have been scary, what did you say to the doctor? Without flinching, the 85-year old woman replied, I told him to go fuck himself. So, Bernie is a magical healer not because of his techniques, but because of his humanity. He brings himself to the process and it is in his presence, his connection, his relationship with people that is the salient greeting for health and wellbeing. I’d like for you to put on your therapist hat for a moment. Do you consciously and intentionally bring yourself to the process or do you rely on models and techniques, you spend so much time learning? Look, we’re all interested in techniques and models and strategies, that’s why we are here, I’m here too for that reason. I’m teaching two workshops on techniques tomorrow, but here is the dirty little secret. When it comes to helping people change, it really isn’t about technique, it is about you. In fact, Bruce Wampold, Professor of Counseling Psychology at the University of Wisconsin—Madison, says, “The evidence is clear. There is a dramatically greater variance in outcomes due to the therapist as composed to the chosen treatment.” In fact Wampold’s research shows that specific treatments or techniques account for less than 1% of the variance and improvement in psychotherapy patients. It’s the therapist that counts, he says, not the therapy. If it’s the therapist that counts, what does this really mean when we work with couples. Our values come seeping through regardless of the models that we’re practicing. We’re must be aware of our preconceived notions and biases. They come to work with us every day. And if we want to be more intentional, we must begin by knowing our hope blind spots. Let me give you an example. I often do an exercise in workshops where I remind therapists that no matter how hopeful we are, there are times when we become less hopeful or even hopeless about helping a particular couple. And we all have this little inner-voice in our heads that narrates our lives and that voice is on duty when we talk to couples. Sometimes that little voice says this marriage will never work; well, this really makes me feel hopeless or they weren’t meant to be together or I hope they cancel the next appointment. And if you’re laughing, I know who you are. So, I ask people to please be honest with me and tell me what’s going on in the room or what are couples actually doing when that little voice inside your head gets hopeless and says this can’t work. And here are some things that people have said, I get hopeless when only one person shows up; I get hopeless when there are no emotions in the room, there is little affects; I get hopeless when they keep blaming each other that no one will accept personal responsibility; I get hopeless when there is name calling in contempt; I get hopeless when they constantly interrupt each other or when there are multiple affairs or when there is domestic violence or when there are substantive use issues or when one spouse is so controlling or when someone says, I never loved you in the first place. Then I ask, how many of you when you heard what made other people feel hopeless about yourself? That situation doesn’t make me feel hopeless. I felt lots of people in that situation. I tell them to raise their hands and then I ask people to look around the room to see that most people have their hands raised. And then I ask what are they thinking? And this is what they hear, I hear, I’ve worked with lots of couples who are extremely angry with each other and I just assume that’s why they are there, it goes with the territory or I worked with many couples where there has been domestic violence and I’ve helped them to have healthy violence-free relationships or I’ve helped couples with serious addiction problems to recover or heal and heal. And then I ask, what does this tell everybody? What it tells everybody is this, hopelessness is in the eye of the beholder; hopelessness is in the eye of the beholder. The longer I work with couples, the less I know about who is going to make it and who isn’t. There are some people who have incredible serious problems, even so much so that I, the psychotic optimist, sometimes get pessimistic. And then, in the eleventh hour, they get it together and they get things on track. And there are other people who have what I consider to be very minimal problems and their marriages end and I see people nodding. I know you know what I’m talking about there. A colleague of mine was asked by a writer of a woman’s journal, how can you tell if you’re going to a good marriage therapist? And he said, just ask the therapist, how can you tell when a marriage is over and if the therapist answers anything implying he or she can tell when the marriage is over, that’s a lousy therapist, go to someone else. We can’t tell when a marriage is over. Only the people in that marriage and the privacy of their own thoughts at night know when they have nothing left to give. So, know your own hope line spots and hang out with colleagues who see things differently, discover why they maintain optimism in the phase of these challenges, breathe their air, learn what they know, see what they see, model what they do. Your belief and the possibilities of change will be palpable. And here’s another example of times when value seep into our sessions. During workshops, I’d like to show videos of my work and stop the video at significant moments to ask participants, if you are working with this couple, what would you say now, what would you do? One example of this is a woman, who is seriously thinking of leaving her marriage, she tells me, the only reason I would consider staying is for the sake of the kids. I stopped the tape. I asked for responses, what would you say? And they vary. Some say, how long have you been feeling this way or another person says, have you told your spouse how you feel? I know the person says, staying for the sake of the kids isn’t enough of a reason. Are there other reasons as well? And then, I turn the video back on and this is what I say to the woman, look, I know things aren’t great in your relationship right now. So, the fact that you’re willing to work on your marriage for the sake of your children speaks volumes about your love for them and your commitment to your family. I’m curious. Tell me who in your life taught you about the importance of family? Where did you learn this lesson? It’s all a matter of focus. Besides being aware of your hope line spots and the ways in which your values are intertwined and everything you say or do, like Bernie Siegel, if you’re going to be a hope monger, you should intentionally bring who you are to your practice. Bernie doesn’t hide behind his degrees or professional experiences and nor should we. If you really want to touch people’s hearts, blast through the professional boundaries that you learned in graduate school. Let people know that we all have hard times, relationships are tough, including yours, hug your clients and if the spirit moves, you send emails between sessions with after-thoughts and don’t worry about fostering dependence. Don’t be afraid to show your emotions, be real, be you. Have you ever cried with your clients? I have. Tell personal stories once in a while. Look, we’re all in this together and sometimes the most powerful and normalizing thing that you can do is to remind people that first and foremost, healers are people too. So, people, I have one more thing to say to you. If you want to help couples love more, to reconnect, to have hope for the future, you have to walk the talk. That doesn’t mean you can’t be a guerilla divorce buster if you’ve been divorced, you can. Some of the most dedicated marriage therapists have been divorced because they get it, but there are certain things you can’t do if you want to teach couples about love and connection. First of all, whatever you do, do not allow yourself to have emotional cut-offs in your life; don’t give yourself permission to quit speaking to a parent, a sibling, a child, any relative or friends; don’t give up on difficult relationships. Emotional cut-offs are a form of giving up. They will happen when you tell yourself that nothing will change and you are better off safe than sorry. And even if you think that you feel safer, I know that there is low-grade sadness that goes along with giving up and it is ever present in the background no matter what you’re doing. And I know as I say this that there are many of you out there who have given yourself permission to shutdown, because you think you just can’t reinvest in that difficult relationship. Indira Gandhi says, forgiveness is a virtue of the brave. But even if you think you can’t, I say you can. I say you can, because even though I don’t know you, I know that each and every one of you sitting in here today has had something happen in your life, an adversity, a challenge, a tragedy, something that really called upon you to go within and find that inner-source of strength that even you didn’t know you had. I know this, because eventually life gives all of us these wonderful opportunities to learn how to rise above adversity. And I know all of you have answered the call. You have found hope where there is darkness. So, that’s what I am talking about. Remember that part of you and bring that part of you to your sessions with couples to challenging relationships, to strangers who dare to share their stories with you. Plan cease of hope and skill-building possibilities, be the Johnny Appleseed of love, do it with everyone you meet. Touching one person’s life can have far-reaching effects, not only for that person, his or her marriage, their children, extended family and friends, but because of the powerful ripple effect that’s created each time, something good happens in the world. Be the start of something good happening in the world. Don’t assume that you’re interfering when you nudge people, even complete strangers, to fight for their marriages. Get involved, save a marriage over coffee, become a guerilla divorce buster. Thanks.
