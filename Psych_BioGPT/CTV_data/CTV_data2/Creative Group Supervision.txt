Creative Group Supervision with Brigid Proctor & Francesca Inskipp A programme from the University of Wales, Newport 

00:00:25
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simmons and I teach counseling at the University of Wales, Newport. Brigid Proctor and Francesca Inskipp have been a hugely influential presence in the world of counseling for many years. Their work on counseling, counseling training and supervision has had a profound impact on very many of us. We've been lucky enough for the university to be visited by them on a number of occasions. But over the last year or so they've made two visits, which would directly related to the program you are now watching. On the first of these, they ran a prolonged group supervision session with a number of my colleagues in the role of supervisee. I say role because this was essentially a role play, but it certainly didn’t feel like one. It felt very real, nevertheless it’s worth emphasizing that these were experienced counseling trainers and were not so experienced counselor playing a role that of trainee supervisees just starting out into counseling world. One I’d edited the tape Brigid and Francesca came back for their second visit to watch it with me and to talk about the work that had taken place. What you are seeing here is made up of excerpts from their conversation and excerpts from the group supervision session itself. This program is really made up of two separate parts. The first shows the way in which the group formed, while the second demonstrates the actual exercises that the group engaged in. Before we started watching the session however I had a question to ask Brigid and Francesca. Brigid, Francesca welcome back to university. The work you did when you came to us before was all around group supervision. 

00:02:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:02:25
MIKE SIMMONS And that left me thinking a bit about just what you see as the advantages of group supervision oppose to individual. 

00:02:35
BRIGID PROCTOR I suppose the, the main advantage is that people have access to so many more clients and so many different perspectives on a single client. If people only have two clients of their own it immediately gives them multiplied by three or four depending on the size of the group. 

00:02:55
MIKE SIMMONS Alright so the two advantages really one which is about I am able to get a perspective on my clients from a number of other people. 

00:03:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:03:05
MIKE SIMMONS But also I am able to get a perspective on other peoples’ clients… 

00:03:05
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s right. 

00:03:05
MIKE SIMMONS …over the same time. 

00:03:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And the other, and the way other people work it’s three(ph) really. 

00:03:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:03:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And I think it’s also for people who are struggling realizing that other counselors are struggling we are not, it’s not a perfect… 

00:03:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:03:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …way of doing things and to be able to recognize that other people are, are having difficulties as well. 

00:03:25
MIKE SIMMONS I can’t say hugely powerful thing is need to know… 

00:03:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …the changes of power somehow. 

00:03:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes everyone else isn't doing it perfectly. Yeah, okay. 

00:03:35
BRIGID PROCTOR And also provided that the group is well run and this is why we’re particularly interested in writing and talking about group supervision. If the groups well run, the power dynamic is quite different than between an individual and an individual supervisor. In individual supervision, there is more likelihood of the supervisee coming in with feelings about authority. 

00:04:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:04:10
BRIGID PROCTOR One sort or another which they themselves struggle with the supervisor with in a group of course there are, there are authority things, but at least it isn’t one-to-one authority issue, so I suppose that’s an advantage. 

00:04:30
MIKE SIMMONS I guess my experience of, of group supervision has been of the supervisor being may be more facilitative… 

00:04:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:04:35
MIKE SIMMONS …of something going on… 

00:04:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:04:40
MIKE SIMMONS Rather than the slightly scary. 

00:04:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:04:40
MIKE SIMMONS One-to-one. 

00:04:40
BRIGID PROCTOR If well run. 

00:04:40
MIKE SIMMONS If well run, yeah. What are the disadvantages are? 

00:04:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well one of the disadvantage is, is that competitiveness come up very strongly in the group as power issues are different. But the powers may be between people, people may feel very competitive with each other I think. 

00:05:00
MIKE SIMMONS Competitive with I want my time. 

00:05:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes and she is doing better than I’m. I’m not so good. 

00:05:10
MIKE SIMMONS I, I could imagine a situation where we are all trying to shine in front of the supervisor… 

00:05:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …and each other. 

00:05:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, (inaudible ) 

00:05:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Of course that brings up the confidentiality. 

00:05:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:05:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP As well particularly people who are working in the same area who may have, who may know families or things from clients. 

00:05:40
MIKE SIMMONS No, the, the lengthy role play that you did when you came to visit us before. The first thing you did was engage a group with the ground rules and engage them with a working agreement and you took quite a lot of time around that. It seemed very important. 

00:06:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:06:00
MIKE SIMMONS …firmly established. 

00:06:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes and in creating a working alliance which we see goes hand-in-hand really. And the working agreement the wider contract seems to the definite people recognize the rule. They will be working within their own individual rules as it were and I’d say recognize, the, the shared professional commitment very clearly and the things that are laid down about good practice really and agree those together. We think this, this rich feel for endless battling without it being clear what it’s about that needn’t be battles can be open discussion rather than a battle. 

00:06:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think we would like to give them the ground rules before we start the group. So that they’ve got those before they come into the group almost and then that can be the basis for making the working agreement. 

00:07:05
MIKE SIMMONS We’re going to ask you about that because they were two different things. First you said the ground rules are the pretty nonnegotiable things. 

00:07:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Oh it’s the working agreement I think it is more nonnegotiable. 

00:07:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:07:20
BRIGID PROCTOR It’s, it's the thing that are laid down in the code of ethics in the agency, in the training course. The things that, that, that are set for us and we’re all working within whether we always agree with them or not. 

00:07:35
MIKE SIMMONS That, that the way in which we all present(ph)… 

00:07:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes and that I think is the working, the wider working agreement was the ground rules more about what happens in the group weren't they? 

00:07:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Good manner, but sometimes called good manners in the group. 

00:07:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right in our particular group. 

00:07:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP In our particular group 

00:07:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm... 

00:07:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:07:50
MIKE SIMMONS As I said that was the first thing that you did when you were working with our group. Let’s just have a look at the start of the session that you ran. 

00:08:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well, welcome back, good to see you again. We met last week you remember just for you to tell each other about your courses that you're on and a bit more about yourself. And this time we are coming back to get to know each other bit more on this session. Um… and then to spend sometime on looking you, you've all had a chance to look at the… a sort of ground rules which we’ve suggested for this group. 

00:08:25
Yes. 

00:08:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And what I want to do is spend a bit of time thinking about those and then at the end to make a working agreement on looking at those rules and how you would like to work. Brigid and I are both going to be in the group, but we will take it in terms as to who is running it. So to know a little bit more about each other what I like you to do is to think of an adjective, a very positive adjective that describes you and is the same sounding as your name for instance if I said fantastic Francesca. A very positive I’m saying and then what I would like you to do as well because on supervision often we talk about things we can’t do. I want you to tell us something that you do well, not a work thing, not unemphatic or work thing but something like for me I would say I’m really good using up all the old odds and ends in the fridge and making an interesting meal as of them that’s my specialty I think. So Brigid will you like to give another example? 

00:09:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Oh blessed Brigid and I suppose when I good at I was thinking, thinking yesterday when I was driving down to see my brother who is not well that what I would miss if I died, if you see I mean and thought how much I enjoyed driving and I think I drive well and I really love it. 

00:10:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Who would like to go on? 

00:10:05
NORMA JAMES Alright I will go first, okay naughty Norma. 

00:10:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Is that positive? 

00:10:10
NORMA Yes it is. 

00:10:10
Yes it is. 

00:10:15
NORMA (inaudible ) good was the time. Yeah and I find something over the weekend that I’m really, really good at. I’m really good at braising lamb shanks. They fell off the bone, they were umm… gorgeous. 

00:10:35
LYNDA MIZEN I think I’d say likable Lynda and I would say I’m good at first aid in, in terms of if there is a problem in, in emergency then I can usually show something had been at crisis. 

00:10:55
JULIE JONES Joyous Julie I think because I do smile a lot and I laugh a lot as well and I just see the positive things in life when thinking And I’m very good at going out and spend a lot of money on clothes. 

00:11:15
TESS BROOKS I’m terrific Tess and I think I’m good at yoga. 

00:11:25
JULIA MARTIN Jesting Julia. I am good at climbing hills, being out and yes, yes I’m good at getting escaping. I’m good at escaping. 

00:11:45
MIKE SIMMONS So the first thing you are doing is just establishing a name game. You're asking to do something with their name and you're asking them to attribute some positive characteristic to that name. 

00:12:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And see this is really important in beginning to build a working alliance there people beginning to get to know something about each other. And also it lightens it up and notice how they’re laughing. 

00:12:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. 

00:12:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And that was a release of tension. 

00:12:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:12:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think in the laughing and knowing something about them outside not just… that’s why I said it’s important to have a, to tell us something well, you do well, not, not work. 

00:12:30
MIKE SIMMONS Umm... 

00:12:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes because I think that breaks the stereotype I mean very quickly and people come into group that begin to stereotype people to take care of who are these people here and you know she is this and she is that. And somehow when people talk about they do outside, it breaks the stereotypes. You know the more inexperience may suddenly turn out to have something that people were absolutely amazed by and it just stops developing premature stereotypes really. 

00:13:00
MIKE SIMMONS You know there is something interesting I was thinking while we are watching it that these people are actually colleagues of mine. They’re role playing being a supervision group. 

00:13:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:13:10
MIKE SIMMONS So they are not really being supervised, but actually there is quite lot of tension. 

00:13:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:13:15
MIKE SIMMONS We are in a studio, we are going to do this thing. What’s it going to be like? And the exercise actually had the same effect to this role playing group as it would have had to a real supervision group. 

00:13:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes I think and I think there was notable wasn’t it? 

00:13:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:13:30
BRIGID PROCTOR How much it felt to us very quickly like a serious group although we knew that they were brining cases that were amalgam of other cases, not real clients and so on for the confidentiality. 

00:13:45
MIKE SIMMONS Even though the name game was, was intended to relax people to make them feel a bit more at ease. We still have sense(ph) of some people there was quite a lot of hesitancy, they were… they were still a bit unsure. 

00:14:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well it is always to go for people to say something they are good at, it’s against our culture. We’ve always been taught it is wrong in our culture to boast and I think that sets that in supervision I want people to say what they are good at as well what they are not doing so well at. And so that starts the, the sort of culture, but in this group it is okay to boast. 

00:14:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. You know I was in fact talking to some counselors doing some other work fairly recently and someone was talking about the difficulty of taking anything good that they done to supervisor. They felt relaxed about taking the bad stuff, but not the good stuff. Let’s look a bit more. 

00:14:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP What we would like to do now is for you to spend just a few minutes that three of you talking and the two of you taking to discuss these ground rules what you’ve read with them. Are there any questions you would like to ask about them? or are there any thoughts you've got before we go on to the next session. So just spend a little time, just turn your chairs around a little bit. 

00:15:00
Okay. 

00:15:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Not disturbing the microphones too much and just see anything that you talking about. What you felt that when you got them, when you read them? 

00:15:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Timing, timing…. 

00:15:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm…five minutes. 

00:15:20
 What I’ve, what I saw (inaudible ) being more trusting (crosstalk)(inaudible ). 

00:15:55
MIKE SIMMONS Quite quickly after that exercise you then brought them up into smaller groups into tows and threes to do some works. 

00:16:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP What seems important so that people know you can break a group up into smaller groups gives them a opportunity to talk more easily. Some people find it quite difficult to talk in the main group I think. And that’s, that’s always gives an opportunity to speak more openly perhaps in tows and threes. And to, and to bounce things off each other more easily. 

00:16:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:16:25
MIKE SIMMONS And may be gaining some confidence in doing that. 

00:16:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, it’s kind of it’s, it’s, it’s ups the possibility for some working intimacy. 

00:16:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, so any questions you’ve got on this or any thoughts. You’ll notice that it has put down all of you under different roles and then this group you’ve lot of roles. How, how that works for you? 

00:16:55
JULIE JONES When I think what sort of words we use sort(ph) of thought about was that we all might be sort of working from different theoretical orientations you know different backgrounds. 

00:17:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:17:05
JULIE JONES And how is that perhaps going to work in a group supervision. Um… so we’re little bits and show how that might sort of work. 

00:17:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes what you said you learned last time that you are on different courses and had got different backgrounds there and it is really being able to listen to each other and hear those before you jump in to say oh but… I mean I think that what we can we learn awful lot from each others, from each others different ways of looking at the same client does that… does that sound… 

00:17:45
Yes. 

00:17:45
I was just thinking in, in when I’m in the roles of a supervisee and presenting. We were talking together about what would be using the names of our clients because we felt a little concerned about confidentiality, if we use real names. 

00:18:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Don’t use real names, have a pseudonym for you and remember to write it down opposite. So that you remember it next time because you don’t have to ask the group and say who did I call this one. 

00:18:10
LYNDA MIZEN Right. 

00:18:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So rush it down on the one the names you're going to use because you’re roughly working across the same sort of areas although you're coming from different parts of the county. So it is, it is really important to maintain confidentiality as much as. But also whether this would will this be part of the agreement we talk about how important it is not to divulge anything that happens in the group. But, but sometimes by disguising your client it is easier for other people they don’t recognize and then perhaps. Oh that was my brother's girlfriend or… Anything else? 

00:18:55
JULIA MARTIN There is an issue about responsibility for me that we discussed in terms of all these rounds are quite different and that sort of personal responsibility of speaking, not speaking, making sure that you're participating equally in sort of merging everything. Yeah it seems like this a lot going on. 

00:19:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Is this a lot going on and this partly our job is conductor if you like of this to help, to help you move into the different roles. But if you recognize the different roles you’re in that’s, that’s part of the beginning of it, but anything else? 

00:19:30
TESS BROOKS I was quite concerned about how things would be pointed out to me because I still feel so new if there is something that might seem obvious to everyone else I have missed, how that… how that’s going to be pointed out to me fed back to me. 

00:19:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP You want the feedback to be gentle you are saying. 

00:19:45
TESS BROOKS Yes, yes. 

00:19:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. At the beginning I’m new and your feeling when you spoke to others last week, you felt some of them had more experience. 

00:19:55
TESS BROOKS Yeah. 

00:19:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Then you although you're old still finishing your training course where some of them had been in other job something. So what your feeling to the group is (inaudible ) I want to learn, but I need to be, I need to be treated gently. 

00:20:10
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah, I said we think, it is about well we have some space because it feels a bit exposing in a group. And, one with that feedback will be then have some space just to reflect on that. 

00:20:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …that’s what you would like? 

00:20:25
LYNDA MIZEN Yes. 

00:20:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Bit of space to write it down this perhaps then. 

00:20:25
LYNDA MIZEN Write it down or just actually to reflect on it in the moment and… 

00:20:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, Uh…huh… So ask for it. 

00:20:35
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah okay. 

00:20:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So this is being… we’re going to go on match and make the working agreement. So these might be the some of the things you want to put in… 

00:20:40
Right. 

00:20:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …the working agreement. 

00:20:40
NORMA JAMES Yes it’s something what we’re talking about as well it sort of fits in to what was… what Tess was saying was something their own trust because it might feel difficult to, to talk about a mistake. And perhaps yeah I think it’s, it’s bit fear about being criticized. 

00:21:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:21:05
NORMA JAMES But also fear that if I give feedback it’s going to be wrong. And then I’m going to look you know bit silly I want to have… 

00:21:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes Uh…Huh… 

00:21:15
 It’s findings…. 

00:21:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …finding the right way. Well, well some of things we will we doing, some of the sort of what we call experiential exercises that will help you onto how you give feedback to each other and what’s… how you do that. So that you know will, will come, but these are the anxious things when we start in a group though they’re… it is exposing. 

00:21:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay so people are asking a lot of questions, their concerns they have around how the different approaches will be treated within the supervision group around confidentiality and then they are starting to get a grip of the different roles that would be expected off them in this group and that seems quite a challenge. 

00:22:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm…umm… I think it is because on the whole it’s our experience that people seem to just set groups up and they hadn’t identified the fact that you're asking very complex things with the people in a group. You're asking them to be a good group. You are asking them to be in co-worker as it were co-workers. And you're asking them to be a supervisee, but to be publicly alongside other people. And you're also aspiring to help them become co-supervisors at a quite early stage of their, not co-supervisors carrying all responsibility for supervision. But the actual facilitative part of supervision. You're asking them to become co-supervisors. 

00:23:00
MIKE SIMMONS Allow them probably stimulating the internal supervisor… 

00:23:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely, absolutely yes. 

00:23:05
MIKE SIMMONS And we’re also getting a sense that for some people this is more challenging than it is for others. 

00:23:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… hmm… 

00:23:10
MIKE SIMMONS We see one of the supervisees essentially saying be nice to me. And that’s, that’s quite an interesting things. 

00:23:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:23:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes it’s something that’s isn’t always made explicit enough that people can say that. And we think that’s really important, well people are given the opportunity to ask for what they want. And most people a lot of people finds feedback which may be critical hard to take. But not everybody can, can say it and particularly if, if they feel they are not as experienced as other people. 

00:23:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:23:50
MIKE SIMMONS What if I was to put to you the kind of counter argument here, there is someone is saying be nice to me. They are also saying don’t challenge me. Let me get off without… 

00:24:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:24:05
MIKE SIMMONS …it being too difficult for me. 

00:24:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, yes certainly, but they would be wanting naturally they say it or not. If they say at least if you know it then you can work with it, that’s the first thing I’d say to that. The second thing I say it is my experience that when people are given permission to do something self-protective rather than what I would call, yeah which is often called defensive. I would call it properly self protective in a group you know nothing about of people. You don’t know if you can trust or not. People are going to be self-protective anyway. If you are given permission to be properly self-protective, people seem to take permission not to have to use that self-protection so much. 

00:24:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. It is interesting that the, the very terms defenses always seems to have a negative connotation but actually if we’re in a strange environment we feel unsafe being defensive seems to be pretty sensible thing. 

00:25:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And especially in a group, I mean say especially you bring certain self-protectiveness to one-to-one. But kind of even more various self protectiveness to a group because it’s so much more difficult to know where the unexpected may come from that gets underneath your protectiveness. 

00:25:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right, I’m just thinking about is everyone in the group always going to be on task or they sometimes going to be having a bit of (inaudible ), yes. 

00:25:36
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think it is talking about challenge. I think it is also a challenge to say that I need this people can speak out and say you know I need, I need to protect myself, really is a part of the challenge and if they can do that they already for gentle challenge. 

00:25:55
MIKE SIMMONS I feel vulnerable in that, that statement is challenging. 

00:26:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …is challenging statement. 

00:26:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay let’s see some more. 

00:26:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay so Brigid would you like to take over them and do the actual working agreement. 

00:26:10
BRIGID PROCTOR So right, it feels to me a little bit of a fraud because you know I give you a whole lot of ground rules and then said okay you know you make the working agreement, but clearly you don’t. I mean we make an agreement of how we want to work together and that is a very personal bit of the agreement, but of course it isn't all the agreement and I though I would give you little teach you a bit. I’m going to move the cups and things a bit, yeah, bottles, down so you can all see. And I've got these Russian dolls and the first thing we need to be really clear about is we are in a much wider agreement we are in a big agreement with the whole of the counseling profession really, psychotherapy profession. We all have as it happens all of you are BACP members and all your, your agency is BACP organization member. So there are certain professional obligations we work within and codified mainly by our, the code of ethics, or at least the framework I should say, the framework for good practice, ethical practice. And, and in a way that’s a big doll and it is also I suppose in fact somebody told me the other day may be you would like that, that’s the professional one. But this one (inaudible ) this one is the contract we are all in with other as citizens and even with the universe. It’s a kind of widest contract within which we live and we would expect each other to be respecting that whatever else, even the professional contract we might feel know as individuals and people and members of human beings it’s something that we want to challenge within this professional contract. But we do it only with a lot of sort and only because that’s in, in here and that’s the prior contract where in the minute we’re born, so that’s one. So, any questions about that one? Can anyone think of anything that might go outside our professional contract? 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
BRIGID PROCTOR I don’t think I can actually. I think the professional contracting corporate most of it but there may be something, it’s worth thinking about. So our professional contract our code of ethics. What do you think you know not the formal things but what informally do you think we require each other because of that? What you, what it boiled down and what are the things that it boils down to. 

00:29:10
LYNDA MIZEN The standards in policies and the agency. 

00:29:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes certainly although the agency one may be is inside it. 

00:29:20
LYNDA MIZEN Right but it will have been driven by the ethic of code. 

00:29:25
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s right, that’s right and, and all those simple things about principles and values and things. What things particularly important to you characterizes as, as counselors. 

00:29:35
LYNDA MIZEN I think the honesty and trust. 

00:29:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Honesty and trust, right. 

00:29:40
…commitment. 

00:29:40
BRIGID PROCTOR …commitment, alright. 

00:29:40
TESS BROOKS …respect. 

00:29:45
BRIGID PROCTOR …respect, yeah. 

00:29:45
NORMA JAMES Look this is confidential. 

00:29:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Confidentiality. 

00:29:50
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:29:50
JULIE JONES …has integrity. 

00:29:55
BRIGID PROCTOR And it may be that the agency or the course contracts that we’re in for the next level. We might feel is, is, is in disagreement with those things and then this group would be a very appropriate way to have over that issue because you don’t go against that without having thought about it very carefully. So we would need I mean a good… you know for a group if there are issues in the course or in the agency that you feel are not properly ethical. I would like you to feel permission to bring it here so we can look at what… 

00:30:35
MIKE SIMMONS This seem like a really nice demonstration with the dolls. You're presenting quite serious of complicated concepts in a rather straightforward way by using that image, right. 

00:30:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, yes I think people do remember much better if they have got a visual aide. They seem to those rather complicated things and all, all it saying is that the big doll, which is professional, why it’s professional contact, contract possible, which takes into account the code of ethics and so on. Then within that there are the specific contract which individuals and the group are in with their agencies and with the training courses and then within that is the contract we set up together as a group that takes into account the ground rules and what people want and how they like to work. And underneath that there are individual contracts that have to fit inside all those contracts like the doll for, for times down, which each bit of individual work on individual supervision with an individual client done with an individual supervisee in the group is also to some extent contracted for time especially and also may be for the way the person wants to work and so on. And then the very heart of that of those dolls is the little tiny one which is the client and which you say is the heart of the matter that all these things can get in the way and seem complications, but they are really to protect the space for that little client. So they get good time and attention in the supervision group. 

00:32:35
MIKE SIMMONS So all of this machinery almost… 

00:32:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, yes. 

00:32:40
MIKE SIMMONS ….is whirling round right in the center there is a client the reason why we are here. 

00:32:45
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s right. 

00:32:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay let’s look it a bit more. 

00:32:50
BRIGID PROCTOR So this is the agency contract, you are all in an agency contract and you're also in a contract with your courses. 

00:32:55
Hmm...Hmm... 

00:32:55
BRIGID PROCTOR So, what...what is if the agency lays down. I mean it lays, it pays me for instance. 

00:33:00
Hmm...Hmm... 

00:33:00
BRIGID PROCTOR It lays down for this supervision that I’m responsible not for your clients, but I’m responsible for you having discussed with the clients and for having told anyone if I’m not um… happy about the way you’re working that I’ve discussed that with you first. I mean your agency lays it down very neatly. I discuss it with you first. If I’m not satisfied, I’ve to let the manager know that… 

00:33:30
Hmm… 

00:33:30
BRIGID PROCTOR …in the interest of clients. So that’s for me um, and also they left, they have said that each of you have to bring a client very week. If you have client, the time you’ve to bring them. Ah, we can talk amongst ourselves what we do if somebody doesn’t have a client when we really hasn’t got anything they want to bring. We can make…make up our own rules about that. But it isn’t for us to say whether or not to present every week. So, is there anything else about the contract wherein with the agency that using cue to remind ourselves of as we’re making this working agreement. 

00:34:10
NORMA JAMES Yeah just as I’ve got a house supervision at college as well on the course. 

00:34:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Alright. 

00:34:15
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:34:15
BRIGID PROCTOR So if the some question about what you, what you bring here with. 

00:34:15
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:34:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Are you having…do you have placement anywhere else? I can’t remember. 

00:34:25
NORMA JAMES Yes, I do. 

00:34:25
BRIGID PROCTOR You do say, you could and do you have supervision in that placement. 

00:34:25
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:34:30
BRIGID PROCTOR So, is the problem about what you bring… 

00:34:30
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:34:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Ah, to each place. How do you think you manage that. How do people manage it. 

00:34:40
NORMA JAMES I think I might have to bring the same client to… 

00:34:45
BRIGID PROCTOR To both place, 

00:34:45
NORMA JAMES To both places. But I think that would be helpful anyway. 

00:34:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:34:50
Um, to get a better and deeper understanding of what I’m doing… 

00:34:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:34:55
NORMA JAMES You will come from different perspective. 

00:34:55
BRIGID PROCTOR I was getting to say that… that’s a difference isn’t it? 

00:35:00
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:35:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes that there you’ll get the person intent(ph) and perspective on it. 

00:35:05
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:35:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And here, you're going to get several other perspective as well. 

00:35:10
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:35:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And…and it will have to be your responsibility how you manage, because in the end, you’re the person with the client. 

00:35:20
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:35:20
BRIGID PROCTOR But do other people have that arrangement as well. They also have to take, they also have supervision on the course as well as… 

00:35:25
We have case managements… 

00:35:30
BRIGID PROCTOR …in managing things. 

00:35:30
…so it’s not quite per se. 

00:35:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Indifferent. 

00:35:30
LYNDA MIZEN Um, but I’m sort of wondering about and perhaps do case work, do a case study. 

00:35:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:35:35
LYNDA MIZEN And I’m…I’m wondering about having… we have to have supervision whilst we’re doing that. 

00:35:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:35:40
LYNDA MIZEN Um, and a supervised report and I’m just wondering will you be able to do that. 

00:35:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, so you’re asking me to be the special supervisor for doing your case study… 

00:35:55
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

00:35:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …really, Oh, I mean within the group, again it will have to be me with the participation of the group. 

00:36:00
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

00:36:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Because I…I don’t have the remit(ph) to be your individual supervisor as well. 

00:36:05
LYNDA MIZEN Okay. 

00:36:10
BRIGID PROCTOR So I don’t know how your course manager that usually. 

00:36:10
LYNDA MIZEN I think I’ll need to check that out with them on the agency sort of how they… 

00:36:15
BRIGID PROCTOR I think so. 

00:36:15
how they’ll feel about me doing some case work. 

00:36:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes…yes… of course it’s good. So I think I mean when we’re… when we think of the special things we want to say about working agreement, and I’m…I’m realizing what I like to put in is to take responsibility for thinking about how your client best served, not your agency or your… or the course, but how the client will be best served by the supervision um, case management that you get. And that ah, we’re aware of that as group and don’t let the person just struggle with it on their own, but check every now and again may be with you, you know is it being difficult as it…is it being conflicting as it making more trouble for you…than help, in which case, to give you space to think how you could deal with it better. 

00:37:05
MIKE SIMMONS There are also talking about courses they’re on and trying to square up in the midst of all this, the demands of the agency and the demands of the course that’s is quite challenging business. 

00:37:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think it sometimes forgotten and we find that things that go wrong in supervision are nearly always, because this original agreement hasn’t been worked through and it is quite tedious to work it through some of it to see this, but it is really important that we all know what are the demands and responsibilities of us from around the… 

00:37:45
MIKE SIMMONS I’m reminded of various things I’ve been where health and safety has been a big issue. When we have students for their first week with us, we talk about health and safety issues, and there’re incredibly tedious, but also incredibly vital. 

00:38:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:38:00
MIKE SIMMONS Ah, in a way, we’re talking about health and safety here as well. 

00:38:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:38:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:38:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:38:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:38:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And um, I think although the main purpose of supervision is the protection of the client. The other purpose is the developments and the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual health of the supervising it. 

00:38:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:38:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And monitor joint monitoring of that. 

00:38:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:38:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So that’s was the health to say the importance. 

00:38:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:38:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …within all these conflicts. 

00:38:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:38:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:38:30
BRIGID PROCTOR That's probably talk about, I talk about agreements as friends, because to me they have always been tedious, but I have come to realize that it is about health and safety. So very nice way of putting it. 

00:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… Okay let see some more. 

00:38:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Um, does…does your, do your courses have any special requirement of this supervision. I mean that the agency requires that you take, ah that you have um, that you write a statement in it, the group helps you do that about way you’ve got to and report back, do the courses have anything other than that. 

00:39:05
LYNDA MIZEN You’ve to attend enough um, one and a half, one and a half hour supervision. 

00:39:10
BRIGID PROCTOR So that take, we take care of that. 

00:39:15
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… Yes. 

00:39:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:39:15
LYNDA MIZEN Um, well I’m not sure how do we split the time as a group, because… 

00:39:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Ah, you mean the individual to have… 

00:39:20
LYNDA MIZEN Yes. 

00:39:20
BRIGID PROCTOR …to have one and a half hour, because you all have been having an hour of your own, haven’t you… 

00:39:25
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

00:39:25
BRIGID PROCTOR …individual supervision. Um, well what…what it mean just five of you, ah have to bring a client each time. 

00:39:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:35
BRIGID PROCTOR So it’s sound as if when we again, when we think about the timing for all particular group, we may need to think about what that means, and whether we, you’re all prepared to vary that. So, think about that now and talk about it again in a few minutes whether you want to say, no I want my time… 

00:39:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:39:50
BRIGID PROCTOR …because I’ve got to have my hour and a half or whether um, you negotiate with the course that since it is a group in your agency that I mean that’s what BACP does. It allows… doesn’t allow you the whole hour and a half, but just allows you a bigger proportion than your own share, so that’s one of the things that you’re going to, we’re going to have to sort out and you probably needs the cooperation of your courses to do that. Make sense or not? 

00:40:20
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah, yes it make sense. 

00:40:20
BRIGID PROCTOR (crosstalk)(inaudible ). 

00:40:25
LYNDA MIZEN Well I was trying to just work it through…. 

00:40:25
BRIGID PROCTOR How to workout. 

00:40:25
LYNDA MIZEN …because we’ve to have um, 100 hours of being supervised. 

00:40:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:40:30
LYNDA MIZEN So I was just trying to do the mental arithmetic. 

00:40:35
BRIGID PROCTOR So I think the course has some responsibility. 

00:40:35
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

00:40:35
BRIGID PROCTOR For noticing that you get the benefit of group supervision. 

00:40:40
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Which in a way gives you far more access to client work and other people’s ways of working and I think they have some responsibility for checking. 

00:40:50
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

00:40:50
BRIGID PROCTOR What they count that as. I don’t think you’ve to do. 

00:40:55
LYNDA MIZEN Right. 

00:40:55
BRIGID PROCTOR The sums. I think you need… 

00:40:55
LYNDA MIZEN Okay. 

00:40:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …to ask them and if necessary you say, I think you now although I only have about 20 minutes it feels like much longer is that you know to other people have group supervision, could we negotiate that it half the time is counted as… 

00:41:10
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

00:41:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …supervision time. 

00:41:15
LYNDA MIZEN And helpful. 

00:41:15
BRIGID PROCTOR So interesting, isn’t it. What this brings up is all the existential issues, which is well I get enough time or whether I’ve too much time. Will it fit in with other people time. 

00:41:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… 

00:41:25
BRIGID PROCTOR I mean those of the things that you can’t you know, you’ve to legislate for in a way and in another way, we’ve to make our personal accommodation with, so um, everything we discussed in these will bring up that kind of… that kind of issue. Will they be too harsh really? Will they be honest enough with me? Will they be too harsh with me? All those things, there are all life issues. Ha…ha… and…and this group will reflect them of all. So, lets ah, that’s I thing that’s enough about reminding you… 

00:41:55
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:42:00
BRIGID PROCTOR …that we only have certain levy, ah of the bigger dolls laid down something, but we have a bit of levy where about what we want from our group and that’s this doll. And I’ll come back to that one because we also have levy within that…that how we decided what we decide we want from each other, we’ve a bit of levy week by week of how we…what we want to bring up that day that’s the agenda for the day, also within that and this bit is a little bit of each…each one of you doing your individual bit of work and that has to be within the all the other dolls, but within that, you’ve a quite bit of levy and you can say you know you’ll be able to say what you want and will be asked what you want from that bit of work. It isn’t just pushed on you, so that’s that. So, this is the one we're concerned with now and I don’t want. We will navigate the rules completely right. What we need is in order to be able to go on and do some supervision today is ah, what…what is basically do we need to know is in our working agreement together. 

00:43:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:43:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And…and becomes back to what you’re saying to Francesca earlier, what are the particular things you want people to notice that you want to get good supervision and where did we start with those at. From that what I can remember most all and notice when I think back at you is ah, well Francesca picking up from what you’re saying. You somehow felt the newer person in the group. 

00:43:35
Yeah…yeah. 

00:43:40
BRIGID PROCTOR And you really wanted some sort of um, assurance that you wouldn’t be mould. 

00:43:45
Yeah…yeah. Ha…ha… 

00:43:45
BRIGID PROCTOR So what could be, what if this is some, if you take up the ground rules, it both as group member and as um, ah… as co-supervisors, it comes under both those doesn’t it?. 

00:44:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:44:05
BRIGID PROCTOR It’s like ah, we all need to have a good group manners, which doesn’t mean saying all please and thank you, but it’s like what do we want from each other, very generally to feel ah, you know that…that…that…that… this is a good mannered well working group. 

00:44:25
JULIE JONES May be that…that we gets a good balance between positive um, may be some positive, you know positive feedback. 

00:44:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:44:35
JULIE JONES But if there is feedback that perhaps, um, you know constructively… that is constructively… 

00:44:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Constructive, right. 

00:44:40
JULIE JONES Um, and that we do you know as balance kind of ah, perhaps some of the things that perhaps need working with along with some very positive aspect, yes. 

00:44:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. Ah, as you’re saying, I was wondering, I saw you got pen and paper. Can I ask you just to make a note. Do you, ah are you okay as scribe or something…. 

00:45:00
JULIA MARTIN Yes it’s fine… 

00:45:00
BRIGID PROCTOR …not something you find tedious. 

00:45:00
JULIA MARTIN No, no… 

00:45:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Or if you could just make a note of what individual says, so ah, then over the time we can work it into a proper arrangement. So, concern the deep playback what… what Julie said, say you get it accurate. 

00:45:15
TESS BROOKS And Julie said that it will be very helpful if we cutoff and something positive with may be some of the aspects of our work we need to work on. 

00:45:25
BRIGID PROCTOR It’s that…that same. 

00:45:30
RENE (ph) Yes that’s… it’s constructive, but there is always, let me got some positive elements in there, so that it doesn’t feel as though you know that’s you’re being criticized I suppose ultimately right, yes. 

00:45:40
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:45:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Right, that constructive for us and critical. So what else do you want for good group manners. 

00:45:50
NORMA JAMES I would like, I think somebody to… to notice if where I’m finding little bit of a struggle. 

00:46:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:46:00
NORMA JAMES Yes. A little bit whether shyness or I can’t come in or that we just to notice… the secret was I guess. 

00:46:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, so some…some recognition of need for support. 

00:46:15
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:46:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Not necessarily being supported. 

00:46:20
NORMA JAMES Um, no… 

00:46:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Though you might want somebody to be… 

00:46:20
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

00:46:25
BRIGID PROCTOR …And then if they noticed they might want to offer some support… 

00:46:30
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:46:30
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s okay. 

00:46:30
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:46:30
BRIGID PROCTOR I mean, you don’t, one doesn’t want support you, you don’t want either do you that’s why you sound that you’re being very attentive. It’s like one does want support, want to be rescued. 

00:46:40
NORMA JAMES No, I don’t thing I want to be rescued. 

00:46:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:46:45
NORMA JAMES But yeah, just…just perhaps um, in the larger group I might find it difficult to, to say what I want to say, yeah. And that it’d be useful for me for somebody to notice that, because like I could…I could just use up and sit back. 

00:47:05
BRIGID PROCTOR So, you would…if…if you're sending those signals, you would like someone to signal back as well. 

00:47:10
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:47:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Not to do it for you, but to signal back… 

00:47:15
NORMA JAMES That’s it… that’s it, yes…yes. 

00:47:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… anything else. 

00:47:20
LYNDA MIZEN We would like just to be heard. 

00:47:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:47:20
LYNDA MIZEN You meant just…just an acknowledgement what I’ve said that, you know sometimes things can get very busy and I sometimes don’t express myself very clearly. And I just want to be heard and put it back to me so I can actually clarify, is my understanding the situation right. 

00:47:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. So you not anyone to… to be heard, but you also in a way want to hear back. 

00:47:45
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah, just because I think I sometimes know what um, certainly but sometimes it’s a pattern(ph) that other people don’t. 

00:47:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Right…right so you want them to help you clarify what you’re saying. 

00:48:00
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

00:48:00
BRIGID PROCTOR As well. Hmm…Hmm… And to hear that they through the clarifying to hear that you have been heard. 

00:48:05
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

00:48:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:10
LYNDA MIZEN And I think in that it sometimes helps me when I feel a bit muddled, it would help me and ravel that muddled. 

00:48:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:48:15
So like just… will comes out and then, and then, and I needed to come back. 

00:48:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Ha…ha… yeah. Anything particularly you notice, you…you want. 

00:48:30
JULIA MARTIN I mean I mentioned earlier about the responsibility um, that I think that was dealt with because you said that you would actually remain in control is that… 

00:48:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Well put it down nevertheless… 

00:48:40
JULIA MARTIN Yes. 

00:48:40
BRIGID PROCTOR …that you want so it frame that’s what you want really. 

00:48:45
JULIA MARTIN Um, I want to feel safe within the structure I suppose. 

00:48:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Right, so stick that one down. And I reiterate what Francesca said. It is ultimately although, you know I’m asking you to be case supervisors, because I think that something you I don’t know if you evaluate now, but you will evaluate later on, I can be pretty certain, you’ll value having had that opportunity. Ah, it remained my responsibility or Francesca when she is working to make sure that your client is well served in this group. Because at the bottom of all these little, at least… 

00:49:25
Oh… 

00:49:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Ha…ha…and we stuck little one 

00:49:30
Oh… 

00:49:30
BRIGID PROCTOR And that is the heart of the matter. It is the heart of the matter and that is that you’re doing good work with your client and your clients are well served. All this business is so much. You know all this, all these dolls are actually about that. 

00:49:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:49:50
BRIGID PROCTOR And it is my responsibility and I’m asking you to share it with me for seeing a good supervision work is done um, not for you ultimately, just for you of course as well, but it isn’t a personal development or even a professional development. Opportunity for you primarily, primarily about seeing that the clients are getting the service that they deserve. And along the line, Francesca and I think, the client is best served by you being well feeling that it’s a development opportunity and so on in the service of getting good work done. 

00:50:30
NORMA JAMES I like that, so you, I like the phrase that you use the heart of the matter. 

00:50:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Ha…ha…heart of the matter. 

00:50:35
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:50:35
BRIGID PROCTOR It’s easy to forget in a group. 

00:50:35
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

00:50:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Because there is so much happening. 

00:50:40
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:50:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think you’re also asking for what are… whichever one of us is running the group to hold the structure. 

00:50:45
Yes, that’s right. 

00:50:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, so that because you can’t get to the heart of the matter unless there is a structure. 

00:50:50
Yeah. 

00:50:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …held and we would be responsible for that. 

00:50:55
Okay. 

00:50:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Which reminds me looking at time. 

00:51:00
Yeah. 

00:51:00
BRIGID PROCTOR So, ah, we don’t have much more time to talk about this. But is there anything going back again to this, these ground rules, Francesca asked you if there is anything you didn’t understand and you seem to understand these rules, do they feel very heavy. Does it feel heavy to have to manage all that. 

00:51:20
LYNDA MIZEN I think when you look at it, it does initially, but I think when you begin to take the part… 

00:51:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm… 

00:51:25
LYNDA MIZEN …ah, it’s manageable. 

00:51:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:51:25
LYNDA MIZEN Yes. 

00:51:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, umm, I think I would like to leave with that. We got some notes down. We thought about the management of time is getting to be difficult, ah and we need to… I think we need to play it by for a week or two, and then decide whether we can offered to be flexible with time or not. I think won’t know that until we’ve moved into the territory and moved about in a debate. So I would like to suggest that…would you agree with that you… 

00:52:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:00
BRIGID PROCTOR …each get equal time. 

00:52:00
Yes. 

00:52:00
BRIGID PROCTOR For the first couple of weeks, and then we’ve a review. 

00:52:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And we see we go back to these things and see if people are getting what they want to have other things to add and we get it back to this and decide if there is anything we want to put in…in there or to taken out. 

00:52:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Because I think it’s too early to say that it when you're actually practicing and get some idea. Okay and do you feel is there anything that would stop you feeling safe enough and clear enough going on to do supervision work now. 

00:52:40
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:40
JULIE JONES I think it’s like…. 

00:52:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Ready to work. 

00:52:45
JULIE JONES And I quite like the idea. I feel…feel already quite supported here. 

00:52:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:50
Yes. 

00:52:50
JULIE JONES So that’s quite a nice feeling. 

00:52:50
Yes. 

00:52:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Good…good. 

00:52:55
NORMA JAMES Yes. And we’ve… I’ve already been able to say um, what I need as well. 

00:53:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

00:53:00
NORMA JAMES So, that’s been important. 

00:53:00
BRIGID PROCTOR You feel free to do that. 

00:53:00
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

00:53:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Good. 

00:53:05
MIKE SIMMONS There is a quite a lot going on here. There is a lot of concerns, a lot of expectations, everyone is working out quite what the deal is, what the deal is in this group, what the deal is as far as profession is concerned, and I noticed you actually asking one of the group members to take the notes for all this. 

00:53:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes…yes…we will, um, I think, we think it’s very useful along the line to employ various, take various task functions that need to happen and not take responsibility for doing all that. I mean the practical level you can’t very easily do that. It distracts from the other roles of the supervisor in a group like this, but it also um, immediately shows that this is co-responsibility and a scribe role and a timekeeper role, the two that it’s very useful to delegate and people really like to take on very often. It also allows people, I mean such a lot is said in that. If something isn’t written down about individual needs and what individuals want from the group that, that stage in the…in the exploration, then, it will go, we’ll forget it. 

00:54:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:54:20
BRIGID PROCTOR So, it’s quite important to get it done and so people can be reminded about that and have a sheets of paper. 

00:54:25
MIKE SIMMONS It’s quite empowering. 

00:54:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:54:25
MIKE SIMMONS Ah, what would you do as you get that person to type up the notes, photocopy that. 

00:54:30
BRIGID PROCTOR I would check if there were, would be interested, would be happy to do that. If so, I don't have the photocopy or I don't have scanner and said "Okay, we will do it you know, I’ll get it done for you or generally somebody else might volunteer and say I will do it." The more you can get people volunteering to do it, but I would never put it on them at this stage of the group. 

00:54:55
MIKE SIMMONS The kind of… first thing coming to my head is, this is our group. 

00:54:55
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s right. 

00:54:55
MIKE SIMMONS Rather than your group. 

00:55:00
BRIGID PROCTOR That’s right. 

00:55:00
MIKE SIMMONS We…we kind of that she learning through this opening stage comparatively quickly. 

00:55:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:55:05
MIKE SIMMONS Ah, it feels like it’s very important to get this foundation right before. 

00:55:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm… 

00:55:10
MIKE SIMMONS Before anything else happens. 

00:55:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm… 

00:55:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think it is, and it is just hard sometimes at the beginning when people are more anxious about bringing their clients and coming, but to really get to this um, sort it ah, to the beginning and to help people particularly to recognize the different roles that they’re gonna be in as a supervisee and to see because I think to make it explicit that they’re not only going to be a supervisee presenting and bring their work, but also they’re going to be helping other people, commenting on other people’s work and um, so that they got that role as well of course supervisee and during this um, in this particular group that… 

00:56:00
MIKE SIMMONS And it’s not just the supervisees have roles in this group. 

00:56:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

00:56:05
MIKE SIMMONS There are also in this occasion two supervisors… 

00:56:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Absolutely. 

00:56:05
MIKE SIMMONS And they have a role as well. 

00:56:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:56:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, I mean that wouldn’t be a typical group that was a device for television. 

00:56:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:56:15
BRIGID PROCTOR And for us as co-workers taking it in terms. 

00:56:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:56:20
BRIGID PROCTOR …I don’t think we ever run a supervision group together have we? 

00:56:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Oh know…only …only in the training. 

00:56:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Just courses and training, but we’ve never run a group. 

00:56:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP But not actually during the group. 

00:56:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:56:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:56:30
BRIGID PROCTOR And…and it is as complex for a… for a supervisor, it is for supervisees run a group like this. 

00:56:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, because the supervisor has all these roles of supervisor, group facilitator, structuring the group, and maintaining the group, the group management. 

00:56:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:56:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

00:56:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm 

00:56:50
BRIGID PROCTOR So it is… 

00:56:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And teaching. 

00:56:50
BRIGID PROCTOR And teaching very much in the beginning. 

00:56:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP In this sort of group, teaching the supervisees, how they are going to co-supervise each other. 

00:57:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yes. Ah, a more complex task. 

00:57:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:05
MIKE SIMMONS In many ways. I mean I think the other thing we…we’ve already talked about the fact that this is a role play. 

00:57:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:10
MIKE SIMMONS And it’s for the most part, the roles are being played by very experienced counselors… 

00:57:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:57:15
MIKE SIMMONS Some of whom are supervisors in fact. 

00:57:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:57:15
MIKE SIMMONS Ah, they know the business, they know the deal, but actually it feels like is just as important for this group of experienced counselors to give it this time, this attention as it would be for group of inexperienced counselors. 

00:57:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely, I mean you might almost say more so, because people tend to make assumption about practicing counselors ah, the competence of being in a group and be ah, about the skills that listening and not competing with other people and of course they will, you know people become have more to lose as they get more experienced. So to create an atmosphere, it’s okay to make mistakes where we don’t judge others or will be compete, be over competitive, of course will be competitive, but over competitive to the point of not being useful for the client is as important as for new people. The tensions will be different, but the need to make explicit what will make for work, making a group work well from the point of the client and the members of it is just as important. 

00:58:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah and I guess they also come with previous experience of supervision. 

00:58:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP That’s what I was going to say, they may have not had experience of being explicit in supervision before about these/ 

00:58:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right…yeah. 

00:58:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Different for some experienced counselors. Hmm… 

00:58:40
MIKE SIMMONS The other thing I’m aware of is…they’re working towards an agreement of how we’re going to work and you’re still acknowledging that this will be reviewed that it’s not cast in the stone and this is how we’re going to work forever. 

00:59:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, no. Um, it’s I think (inaudible ) says um, you know you may have a map, but you don’t know what the territories like. This is really a map making and…and a taste(ph) because of the exercises and things of how we’re going to work. Sending up a balloon of the kind of (inaudible ), to getting to be. But ah, they won’t understand what it means in terms of supervising and being supervised for sometime in. 

00:59:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:25
MIKE SIMMONS And we don’t know what’s going to come up. 

00:59:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:30
MIKE SIMMONS No one in this group knows what’s going to come up. This going to I guess challenge that agreement. 

00:59:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

00:59:35
MIKE SIMMONS That will make it need to be reviewed. 

00:59:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And it does need a supervisor being responsible for making space for a review. 

00:59:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:40
MIKE SIMMONS Because I guess sometimes, the client work seems so important that is why we’re here. 

00:59:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

00:59:50
MIKE SIMMONS I can get a bit edged out, well actually without being acknowledged and worked with…the work with the client isn’t going to be… 

00:59:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

00:59:55
MIKE SIMMONS ...as effective. 

01:00:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… tried(ph). There suppose to a group, dynamic group or self developed personal development group, even a professional development group. The professional development is in the service of the client rather than the service of the group members primarily. 

01:00:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:00:15
BRIGID PROCTOR They are, but getting the group members to work well um, to work well together allows a task to be done better. 

01:00:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:00:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Isn’t a task. 

01:00:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I’m wondering if it gives you an opportunity to look at how is the maintenance going, how are we getting on together. 

01:00:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm… 

01:00:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:00:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm... 

01:00:30
MIKE SIMMONS I guess of a clear parallel with the counselor, with the client. 

01:00:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Very much. 

01:00:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

01:00:35
MIKE SIMMONS How is it going, what we do… 

01:00:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

01:00:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, okay, let see some more. So the group is formed and is reached an understanding of how it’s going to work. To see it working, you need to switch to the second disk. 

01:00:55
[sil.] 

01:01:00
University of Wales, Newport Prifysgol Cymru, Casnewydd 

01:01:05
MIKE SIMMONS The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students, and anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics for the use of counseling skills and we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. 

01:01:35
I just had a really terrible day today. 

01:01:35
MIKE SIMMONS Using a wide range of examples in the informative, but lighthearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered both in face to face work and over the telephone. 

01:01:50
NORMA Ah, my name is Norma how can I help you? 

01:01:55
MIKE SIMMONS We also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas and this series in common with our other material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. If you're a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we'll have something to interest you. Call for the brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer. 

01:02:25
hss.newport.ac.uk/sas/counseling.htm 1st Client Presentation “Noddy Jackpot” 

01:02:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, well, we’ve done the check in today and we’ve also done, you remember the…the agenda that we’ve build our agendas today, you brought in what you want and what you want to present and you’ve also asked for 10 minutes at the end to look at the process. So, we must remember at the ends, um who can see the clock. Can you see the clock easily. 

01:02:50
Yes. 

01:02:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, so you remind us 10 minutes before the ends that we’re going to allow 10 minutes to make sure we’ve some process time. And I wanted to do an exercise called the “Noddy Jackpot”, ha…ha…, which is an exercise to help you, listen very carefully and playback exactly what the person has said. Practice and not putting in your ideas or your opinions or anything, but just hear exactly what the person has said and play it back to them. Just um, a very brief bits back to them and then, she said she prepared to present her client to do. 

01:03:30
Yeah. 

01:03:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP This is her client. She’d like a bit of um, to help with some confusion, to clarify because this is a very good way of clarifying for people. I remember the person presenting is the person doing the work. We don’t as supervisors have to do the work for them, we’ve to help them and this is a very good way of helping somebody else try to find them and do it. So, what you’ve to do is to listen carefully and in turn I’ll ask you to give one phrase back to (inaudible ) absolutely exactly what she said. Don’t change it, it’s not putting it into your own words. It’s not paraphrasing, it’s just said and if you get it right, then they will… say “Yes”, which is the Noddy Jackpot. If you’re not quite right, she will be hmm… may be. 

01:04:20
LYNDA MIZEN I feel a huge sense of responsibility in that. 

01:04:20
BRIGID PROCTOR I know yes. Ha…ha… 

01:04:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And if it’s client wrong, she will go that and you can neither have not to go or you can ask the person next to you to help you to get it right. If you can’t think of anything in the spur of the moment, you can say pause and one have about three or four hints of Lynda talking, and then I’ll stop her, and then I ask you to put back that. Okay, is that clear. 

01:04:45
Yes. 

01:04:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay you’ll start(ph). 

01:04:50
LYNDA MIZEN Um, I want to bring a… a young lady called Joe. She is 21 and she is recently split up with her husband. She has a young child and she is a referral from GP practice and is come along to help her manage her anger. We’ve met on three occasions, however, I…I bring her today, because she keeps counseling. 

01:05:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Stop, stop at that moment when occasionally halfback. Just one thing she said who wants to start(ph). 

01:05:30
JULIA MARTIN (inaudible ) bringing Joe who is a young woman, aged 21, who has a young child. 

01:05:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay. 

01:05:40
TESS BROOKS My mind is completely blank. 

01:05:40
Ha…ha… Ha…ha… 

01:05:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, pause wait until you hear somebody. 

01:05:45
JULIE JONES Um, Joe is referred through ah, her GP and you’ve a problem because she keeps counseling. 

01:05:55
NORMA JAMES I guess, however, I want to bring her today, because she keeps on counseling. 

01:06:00
Hmm… hmm… 

01:06:05
One bit is being missed. 

01:06:10
JULIA MARTIN Um, she wants to deal with her anger. 

01:06:10
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

01:06:15
Okay. 

01:06:15
LYNDA MIZEN That’s right. 

01:06:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Good. 

01:06:15
Right. 

01:06:15
MIKE SIMMONS So what we understand is you’ve already built an agenda with this group. 

01:06:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… hmm… 

01:06:20
MIKE SIMMONS They said what they need from the time. 

01:06:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. Hmm… hmm… That’s a game a demonstration of how we think a group should start each time to remind, remind the importance of the agenda building. 

01:06:35
MIKE SIMMONS And also the… ah their part in determining what happens. 

01:06:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And they are expected to bring something for the agenda, that’s the other thing. 

01:06:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:06:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think that’s the agenda they are expected there. They will have something to contribute. 

01:06:45
MIKE SIMMONS In my mind there is something like there aren’t any passengers here we’re all part of the same. 

01:06:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm...Hmm... 

01:06:50
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, then you set up the first exercise Noddy Jackpot. 

01:06:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think this is because we want to demonstrate that in the participative group we want to recognize that people need to learn how to co-supervise and one of the really important things to learn is how to be able to listen intently and put back to the persons so that they recognize the person presenting is doing the work. And by getting them to concentrate on listening and just putting back what said, it stops them putting in their own ideas. 

01:07:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:07:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Early on. 

01:07:35
MIKE SIMMONS And then, a clear model with working with the client of course. 

01:07:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah, yes. 

01:07:35
MIKE SIMMONS And they’re really listening intently and it’s very interesting exercise. 

01:07:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… hmm… and what we found is that with the more experienced counselors it’s really very difficult to task, they have got used to having conscious from the first word someone speaks, first moment the client appeared in story. And they find this task terribly difficult and it is a very useful thing to do with experienced counselors, even experienced supervisors. 

01:08:10
MIKE SIMMONS I’m just thinking of supervision group I’ve been in the past where suddenly we’re thinking we’ve invented this client. You know we’ve have all gone off on a kind of (inaudible ) and… 

01:08:22
yeah. 

01:08:22
MIKE SIMMONS The actual client has been left behind in some way. I guess now it going to happen with this exercise. Very focused. 

01:08:30
LYNDA MIZEN Okay well, as I say we’ve met on three occasions but there has been a long gap in between and I do just the agency said you know got a name run to make an appointment and first she didn’t wanted to come on the days and it just feels messy that she seems to put obstacles in the way and didn’t want to meet on the first day could she come on another day and then she didn’t want to come at all she was to going to see someone else and then finally, she came and when she came she was a bit sort of truculent, is a bit sitting there and I feel what am I doing her. I feel very stuck with her in the room and they have a sense that I’m working too hard to do something with and I don’t feel relaxed. 

01:09:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP okay. 

01:09:25
JULIE JONES We’ve seen on three occasions and she is willing to see on three occasions with gaps in between and um… 

01:09:40
Okay that will do. 

01:09:40
NORMA JAMES Um… you said I feel very stuck with her in the room. 

01:09:50
TESS BROOKS We said it feels very messy. 

01:09:55
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

01:09:55
JULIA MARTIN Described to as truculent. 

01:10:00
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

01:10:00
JULIA MARTIN Um… and that she is uncomfortable, messy in… in the room. 

01:10:05
LYNDA MIZEN I note… I think it might be me more being this. 

01:10:15
Right, okay. 

01:10:15
LYNDA MIZEN But that’s useful. 

01:10:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right, that one wasn’t quite right with it. 

01:10:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP When it’s not quite right, that’s the time when immediately the counselor was saying but that hold me clarify and of course that’s the same with the client. If you don’t get your paraphrase right with the client, the client will say oh… no but so and so… so and so… 

01:10:40
MIKE SIMMONS And suddenly both understand a little bit more. 

01:10:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And that… and that’s Noddy Jackpot. 

01:10:45
MIKE SIMMONS When I was a kid um there was a toy that I never owned but kind of vaguely coveted and it was called something like the little sculpture(ph) kit and quite clearly what it was… was a statue made of harder material with then plaster of Paris poured all over it and your job as a kid was to slowly tap away the plaster of Paris and reveal the statue inside as if you’re painting by numbers for statues. By the way I was kind of reminded of that watching this exercise. There is more and more clarity. We can more and more see what that issue is as the process goes on. 

01:11:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And as you get into the center, the person feels more and more vulnerable. 

01:11:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:11:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP As you chip them. 

01:11:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:11:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP As she chips the plaster away. 

01:11:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. I guess she is being invited to chip the path. 

01:11:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah, because she says at one point I feel fraud and other time she is able to say I feel. I feel uncomfortable in the group now. 

01:11:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, a lot of vulnerability. And the exercises started with Tess saying she didn’t know what to say and you’re just accepting of that will come back, it will back later. And now later on she is engaged in the process as well. 

01:12:05
BRIGID PROCTOR I think that… that acceptance who often say I’ve got to try hard to accept. I really think at the beginning of the supervision group you need to do dressage and remind I need to remind myself, we need to remind ourselves that acceptance isn’t something that you’ve got to do acceptance is what… what creates the culture that allows thing to happen without that the group will be dodging and weaving but if one can truly remember that every contribution the mind frees or anything else is it that’s what this is. Then result seems to happen from that. 

01:12:55
MIKE SIMMONS So I guess you’re talking about unconditional (inaudible ) regard. 

01:12:58
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely. 

01:13:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:13:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely and of course judgment come in later of competence and stuff like that the normative bit but at this stage and when you’re using a experiential exercise acceptance is all. 

01:13:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:13:15
LYNDA MIZEN When she comes into the room and she sits down I actually feel as if she is testing me and unless I’m talking about I… I feel very, very deskilled by… by my work and I can’t seem to think what good work I’ve done just to feel that she is… Oh I’m set me up and I feel a fraud now and I feel very embarrassed sharing this with you all but it’s… it’s something about what’s happening when… when I reflect things to a… it seems like I’m trying to help and I’ve made some inroads and then she will be saying yeah, but that’s not good work. 

01:14:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Do you want to stop. 

01:14:00
TESS BROOKS You feel very tested by your client and deskilled. 

01:14:10
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

01:14:15
JULIA MARTIN You said you feel she is setting you up. 

01:14:15
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

01:14:15
NORMA JAMES I feel very deskilled with her. 

01:14:20
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

01:14:20
JULIE JONES Yes you feel you feel set up you know to say set up… 

01:14:25
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah, you just doesn’t feel real. I think it’s because she didn’t start in the usual way of that I’ve know a few client that I’ve had you know they’ve come long and they’ve been willing and this is the first person that I’ve ever experienced being resistant in terms of not wanted to come on the day that was met and then counseling with short notice that feel unsettling and it’s…it’s possibly something about my own stuff that I know I need the hours to get my course in so if she consults it’s another hour that I count sort of I log off and I’m wondering if perhaps that gets in the way and… and we’ve done silence instead of skills practice and I’m usually feel okay with them, but when…when she is silent, the silence is quite deafening and I feel like perhaps want to fill it. 

01:15:25
Um, okay. 

01:15:25
NORMA JAMES This is the first client that’s been so resistant. 

01:15:30
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

01:15:30
JULIE JONES Yeah it didn’t start in the usual way um, that previous clients started. 

01:15:40
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

01:15:45
TESS BROOKS You thought very unsettled by this. 

01:15:45
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:15:45
JULIA MARTIN Her silence is deafening. 

01:15:50
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

01:15:50
NORMA JAMES I feel so unreal. 

01:15:50
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:15:55
JULIE JONES You normally very good with silence, comfortable with silence. 

01:16:00
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah. 

01:16:00
JULIE JONES With this clients, it’s quite deafening. 

01:16:05
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

01:16:10
NORMA JAMES There is a clash, you know I’m not using your words now. 

01:16:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

01:16:15
NORMA JAMES Um, sorry, I know, yeah. 

01:16:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Somebody help her. 

01:16:25
TESS BROOKS Confusion. 

01:16:25
JULIE JONES Yeah. 

01:16:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:16:30
TESS BROOKS Sad of think, I wonder if it’s my stuff because I need the hours for my course. 

01:16:35
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…it’s about getting, I need to have so many hours that supervised to get my course and um, it’s heading towards that time when each client is very precious and…and even know I didn’t say clash, I think when Norma said clash I think there is a clash actually more I want for the session and what she wants. 

01:17:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… 

01:17:00
LYNDA MIZEN And perhaps, because it’s my first experience of someone being resistant and me feeling deskilled and I’m not thinking of the little person in the front there. I’m thinking more about her peer and in terms what I need for my course. 

01:17:20
Okay. Thank you. 

01:17:20
NORMA JAMES I'm not thinking of a little person, you’re thinking what you need from the course. 

01:17:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah, yeah fine. 

01:17:30
TESS BROOKS Ah, she felt like right word (inaudible ). 

01:17:36
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… it did… 

01:17:40
JULIA MARTIN I’m thinking of having… 

01:17:45
LYNDA MIZEN I feel uncomfortable sitting in the group now, but I'm beginning to realize that I’m perhaps been thinking of my needs more. 

01:17:55
[sil.] 

01:18:00
LYNDA MIZEN So, when you said that Julie as it feels, but I feel a bit uncomfortable and perhaps she has been resistant because I haven’t engaged with her and/or whether it’s ah, they still have piece of confusion and I perhaps want the help to sort it out. 

01:18:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…huh…So can I have that last bit back, ah… 

01:18:25
LYNDA MIZEN Uh…Huh… 

01:18:25
JULIE JONES It’s feel uncomfortable sitting in the group right now. Because I think I’ve being looking for my needs. 

01:18:30
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:18:35
NORMA JAMES Do you think, you've been resistant to have because you’re being confused by the needs. 

01:18:45
LYNDA MIZEN May be. Not quite. 

01:18:45
NORMA JAMES Not quite. 

01:18:45
LYNDA MIZEN Not. 

01:18:50
Nearly. 

01:18:50
LYNDA MIZEN If we’re doing nodding and… 

01:18:50
Half way that… 

01:18:55
JULIA MARTIN You're wondering, you said perhaps a few times, perhaps its, because if…if the clash and perhaps it’s because I haven’t engaged with her. 

01:19:05
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:19:05
JULIA MARTIN As much. 

01:19:10
LYNDA MIZEN It…it feels like it’s evolving as I’m speaking and sitting here now, but I’m getting some insight and…and it’s perhaps being that I’ve been resistant to her resistance, yeah… and…and…when I’m saying perhaps, is because I’m thinking of it tentative and I keeps sort of flipping back to the last times we’ve met and…and just trying to go through the work that I’ve done with her. 

01:19:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Good that’s seems a really good place to stop Lynda and that from the simple just being put back… 

01:19:45
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:19:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …what you’re saying, you’ve managed to work on that. 

01:19:45
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…yeah. 

01:19:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And just sort some of your confusion out. 

01:19:50
LYNDA MIZEN Right. 

01:19:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP You’ve been very brave and saying negative things about…about yourself, but beginning to work out why… why that’s happening. 

01:20:00
LYNDA MIZEN Yeah I think when I was sitting here, it was beginning to feel uncomfortable, umm… however, having done the exercise and that it’s not quite so scary. 

01:20:10
TESS BROOKS Hmm… 

01:20:10
LYNDA MIZEN So, umm… thank you. Yeah. 

01:20:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… Yes. So you’ve got something you wanted to go back to that client with? 

01:20:15
LYNDA MIZEN Yes of course, something further to work on to… 

01:20:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm…Hmm… 

01:20:20
LYNDA MIZEN …to lookout before we next meet. 

01:20:20
Right. 

01:20:20
LYNDA MIZEN Thank you. 

01:20:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Can I suggest something? 

01:20:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… 

01:20:25
BRIGID PROCTOR I wonder if you could just ask them to do one round, tell you one thing that I…I like to admired after she has been telling them. 

01:20:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay. Would you like to do one round to tell Lynda something he would admire about the way she has done it? 

01:20:40
NORMA JAMES Yes. 

01:20:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP One thing each? 

01:20:45
NORMA JAMES I really admire the way you sat with a discomfort as it becoming there more uncomfortable for you. 

01:20:50
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

01:20:50
NORMA JAMES You stayed with it. 

01:20:55
JULIE JONES I admire you for being, for actually saying all good first. 

01:21:00
Great isn’t it. 

01:21:00
Yes. 

01:21:00
LYNDA MIZEN I think because I jumped my feet in the water first when we’re talking. 

01:21:05
TESS BROOKS I really appreciate the honesty and I mean, to kind explore it, helping it. 

01:21:10
JULIA MARTIN So I think it’s same for me really you, yes that the part of trust that you’ve put in. 

01:21:20
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:21:20
JULIA MARTIN The group and such in early stage who needs. 

01:21:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Good any comment to finish that Lynda? 

01:21:25
LYNDA MIZEN I think I just need a little moment just to sit and let them come down. 

01:21:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Just sit and come down and that was just to make difficult. Thank you very much being first to, to be brave enough to present. 

01:21:40
MIKE SIMMONS And you ended the exercise by inviting them all to give Lynda some form of that relation? 

01:21:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes it seemed important particularly at that point, because Lynda obviously had made herself very vulnerable. 

01:21:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right 

01:21:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Really and felt vulnerable in it, but you could see the difference when she had the affirmation. 

01:21:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, so it was the response to what was going on… 

01:22:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… 

01:22:00
MIKE SIMMONS …in the room. 

01:22:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:22:00
MIKE SIMMONS …at the time? 

01:22:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP But it could be good point anyway to do in the end of an exercise too. 

01:22:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess the more it works… 

01:22:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:22:10
MIKE SIMMONS …it’s an exercise and more you might want to do that. 

01:22:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, but of course, we’re on video as well, so it’s even more important in this something, because even more umm… makes her personally more vulnerable to it really when, I know that. 

01:22:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:22:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… 

01:22:25
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

01:22:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Even when they role play. 

01:22:30
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… Yes, makes little difference, I think. Okay, let’s looks at the next exercise. 

01:22:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm… Shut your eyes, ah… be in touch with your breathing and just gently contemplate your clients. And notice any point with them in which you felt uncomfortable or confused or ah… unsure. And decide which client you would like to take sometime just to explore that discomfort or uncertainty. And it may be that the clients don’t produce that in the usual way and they might be out of professional people that you’ve interacted with, that you have something you would like to explore instead. Ah… And that’s okay, because you’ll get your supervision in this group anyway. So, think about all the kind of professional interactions you had as well. 

01:23:40
[sil.] 

01:23:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Just notice curiosity, puzzlement, confusion, anxiety, dislike. So, we’re not going to talk about this at this point at all. What are we going to ask you to do is a little exercise in which I’ll ask you to draw, but something very simple. So, if you three would like to take that table, clear it, and ah… get a sheet of paper, Norma if you could get. I’ve got some card there for people to draw, and then and you put to any of one table. I think you’ll find some crayons there as well, a box of crayons. 

01:24:30
Yes. 

01:24:30
BRIGID PROCTOR And umm… for each take a bit of paper. Now, just umm… put it where you can each grab the crayon does and when you need. Now, I want you each to decide who is A and B and for you it’s to decide who’s A, B, and C. 

01:24:45
TESS BROOKS B. 

01:24:50
(crosstalk)(inaudible) 

01:24:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

01:24:50
Now. 

01:24:50
Oh I’ll do this. 

01:24:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm… I want you each now to think of… go back into thinking, contemplating again, think about the issue you’ve decided to explore. And I want you to draw the person who you have the issue with as a fish. 

01:25:15
As if they. 

01:25:15
BRIGID PROCTOR As a fish. Now, some of you may hate drawing, but actually everyone can draw some kind of fish. 

01:25:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:25:20
BRIGID PROCTOR You’ll find you can. Okay. And you have about one-and-a-half minutes to do that, very quick. And no talking, absolutely no talking. 

01:25:35
MIKE SIMMONS As a fish? 

01:25:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, as a fish. Two things about that’s one is that ah… as I say on video, everybody can draw a fish, it seems. We’ve never had anybody who says they can’t, even though they may be quite drawing phobic as people are from school. Now, secondly, ah… it accesses ah… what they know out of awareness. 

01:26:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:26:00
BRIGID PROCTOR As in someway they didn’t know they knew, ah… but by drawing somebody as a fish, even when they aren’t drawing what they want to draw, it seems to represent something about the out of awareness understanding of this person. 

01:26:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:26:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay one-and-a-half minutes up. Now, I want you all to turn your… your bits of paper, first face down. Then, I want B to turn their’s face up. Now, each of you are co-supervisors to be. Umm… In your case, you’re case supervisor. And there’re very strict rules and this is a very strict exercise. You’ve the obey the rules absolutely. 

01:26:55
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:27:00
BRIGID PROCTOR B has to think quite carefully what they want from their co-supervisors. And there is a whole choice of things you could do, you could just take the time to talk yourself and they stay silent, we’re going to have about a minute. Umm… You can ah… ask them to say what they would feel like if they with that fish? You can say what to think I would feel, you would feel like if you were looking as a person that looked like that fish? Ah… Now, absolutely can’t ask them to talk about the person themselves. You can only talk about the picture of the fish. Ah… Even if you take the time yourself, it’s to say what you see in the fish, not to tell them about the client, okay. You can… 

01:27:45
LYNDA MIZEN Can you just clarify that a little bit. 

01:27:45
BRIGID PROCTOR It’s like you’re not getting to tell them the background of the person or the client and to know it, the client or a person, you’re talking about… You… If you say, I want to talk for that one minute and they want anything from you, then what you talk about is your picture. 

01:28:00
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:28:00
BRIGID PROCTOR You don’t talk about the client. So there’s no information about the client at all in this exercise, okay. And or you… Any… Anything else you can think off. You would like to what you see there, what you imagine there, you know anything you like, but they have to abide by what you’ve asked them to do and do nothing else. You could say what would you interpret, but… but if they’re not asking for interpretations, you shouldn’t give interpretations, okay. Right, now off you go, you have one minute. 

01:28:35
LYNDA MIZEN I’d like you just to look at my picture and tell me what you see? 

01:28:45
TESS BROOKS Frustration. 

01:28:45
JULIA MARTIN Depression, it’s all weighing you down. 

01:28:50
BRIGID PROCTOR You’ve to tell them what you want. 

01:28:50
NORMA JAMES Okay. I think I’d like just to try and explain there, because I’m… I’m not at all certain why I’ve drawn this. If I could just describe what I’ve, coz it’s a bit of personal for me. 

01:29:05
JULIE JONES Right. 

01:29:05
NORMA JAMES Yes. Umm… (crosstalk)(inaudible). I can’t see where your fish is… is you think like by so, it’s closed, and it’s (inaudible ) and I’m not certain about… It’s facing downwards. Umm… And it’s got a smiley… a smiley face and very small eyes. And that’s the personal, coz the fish have usually got big open nose circle. Ah… But this one hasn’t it, it’s closed and it’s (inaudible ) and I’m… I’m not certain about that. 

01:29:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay, time up. Turn it round back in, and then we’re going to repeat with B. 

01:30:00
MIKE SIMMONS So what’s happening here? 

01:30:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, so many things and it’s very complex little exercise, ah… but the purpose of introducing that exercise in a group is, as I say on… on the video umm… it’s very… it’s a very strongly disciplined exercise. People aren’t allowed to ask or say or hypothesize anything unless the person drawing the fish has asked them specifically to comment in that way. So, it’s very good for disciplining. It’s very good teaching exercise for disciplining… 

01:30:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:30:35
BRIGID PROCTOR …the co-supervisors. 

01:30:40
MIKE SIMMONS And you’re being very clear about, this is… these are the moves of this exercise. This is what you’ve gotto do. Yeah. 

01:30:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes and in fact there is a umm… What’s interesting is that people think if they don’t want to be a bossy supervisor umm… they… they have to be very laid back in a ah… But actually there are two different tasks. In this I do no supervision at all. The supervision is all done by the person themselves and… 

01:31:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:31:05
BRIGID PROCTOR …their things. But I’m very bossy about managing the exercise, which makes it safe. If you don’t manage the time boundaries get them really clear. Umm… Get it very zippy, ah… not much time. Ah… That’s the way that ah… a result seem to emerge. 

01:31:25
MIKE SIMMONS And this is a very different exercise to the previous one. You were working with materials, paper, pens, crayons and so forth. 

01:31:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, you’re getting it two things really. You are getting it unconscious material really by getting people first of all to do that relaxation and think about the clients there, and then to draw without thinking too much… 

01:31:45
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:31:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …really on it. And you’re also getting them to rec… to recognize the importance of, they being able to say what they want from supervision. 

01:31:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:31:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Being very clear that they have got to say what they want to. 

01:32:00
JULIA MARTIN Can you tell me what emotions you see there? 

01:32:05
TESS BROOKS I was just about to say actually and that… that the (inaudible ) on the eye, but then the eye looks kind of always angry actually. I’m not sure they look sad or angry. 

01:32:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay, that’s the end of the that one. Turn it over and here we have A left or C left. 

01:32:20
TESS BROOKS C left. 

01:32:25
BRIGID PROCTOR So turn over yours and do the same. I’ll talk to these people. Have either of you chosen to talk about being a fish? 

01:32:30
NORMA JAMES About being it? 

01:32:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Being it, what it would be like if you were this fish? 

01:32:40
NORMA JAMES No. 

01:32:40
BRIGID PROCTOR So that’s what I’d like you to. I’d like you to, while they’re doing their one-and-half minutes, each take three quarters of a minute just to say if I were the other person’s fish, I think this is what it feel like. Do you understand that? 

01:32:55
JULIE JONES Right, so if I was… 

01:32:55
BRIGID PROCTOR You do her and she does yours. 

01:32:55
JULIE JONES Right. 

01:33:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay, three quarters of a minute. 

01:33:00
TESS BROOKS I think I feel quite sad and, yeah not in my… 

01:33:10
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm…Hmm… 

01:33:10
MIKE SIMMONS And he is a little extra that you were just using to make out for the fact that they’re uneven group sizes. 

01:33:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

01:33:20
MIKE SIMMONS Plus it also seems a valuable addition to the exercise? 

01:33:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, that’s one of the problem… problems of course and it… it does mock-up the timing quite badly. But ah… I just thought of a… of a little task, which was to get them to. I had notice neither of those seemed to identifying into the drawing. So, I just invited them to… to identify into the other person’s fish and say what I would feel like… 

01:33:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:33:45
BRIGID PROCTOR …as that fish and it seemed to be helpful. 

01:33:45
MIKE SIMMONS Seems useful to that… 

01:33:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Well time up. 

01:33:50
Hmm… 

01:33:50
TESS BROOKS Thank you. 

01:33:55
BRIGID PROCTOR And ah… if you all turn the face up, you’ve gotto… you ought to face up, to return them face up. Now, I want you to draw yourself on the same page as fish as well. On the same page that you got your fish with this person. 

01:34:10
JULIE JONES With…with this person or as… 

01:34:15
BRIGID PROCTOR With that person in relation to that fish. Draw another fish. And that’s about half a minute. 

01:34:30
MIKE SIMMONS A little themselves as a fish too? 

01:34:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, I mean, that’s very interesting, because if you think about it is umm… it’s transference and counter transference ah… made explicit or made visible and not necessarily explicit. We very seldom use words like transference and counter transference early on ah… in working with people, because we find they’ve… even if they’re being on the psychodynamic course, they seem to find them terribly muddling, ah but if they draw themselves as a fish in relation to their client see how little space they had left or the huge space that their feeling on wondering what to do with, it immediately shows them what's happening in the relationship and its generally the bit where you get the most laughter and surprise, really. 

01:35:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:35:20
BRIGID PROCTOR And… and it seems to us that its that that very simple little exercise reveals in a… in an incredibly short time really very short time three bits of work done in 15 minutes. Three bits of really good work done in 15 minutes reveals more than talking about it for may be half an hour. 

01:35:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Greater understanding… 

01:35:45
BRIGID PROCTOR For one case in half an hour. 

01:35:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:35:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And also its this an exercise that they can do at home at any time. After they have seen the client. They can… 

01:35:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:35:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …draw them as a fish. 

01:35:55
MIKE SIMMONS Interesting thinking about making client notes which… which we always think of being text based. 

01:36:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:36:00
MIKE SIMMONS Uh… But thinking about also introducing something like this into this. 

01:36:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay. And then just look at it for a second or two just think about it. I am not going to ask you to talk with each other about this at all. This is just for you to look at for yourself and when you feel ready just write three words that you would like to keep in mind for yourself umm… when you next encounter this client of us. Three words that come to mind as you look at that… at that picture. 

01:36:45
[sil.] 

01:36:55
The whole picture? 

01:37:00
BRIGID PROCTOR The whole picture or any thing of the whole scenario, anything that you want to remember or first come to mind about the whole scenario. 

01:37:15
[sil.] 

01:37:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay. Anybody who doesn’t want their fish to be on this play? So other people can just look at what they have drawn and written. You are happy for the ones there? So if you like to put away the… the umm… the cardboard and the pens, take them up seen as it were. And then we can just put… put all the pictures on the table in the middle for a minute. And you can… I noticed your sleeking looks at each others pictures. 

01:37:55
Hahaha… 

01:37:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Now you can look at them, hopefully. And fascinating aren’t they? 

01:38:05
[sil.] 

01:38:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And then just leaving… leaving those scenarios aside that bit of self supervision aside just let come back into the group being co-supervisors and just for a minute or two think about the exercise what was it like for you to do. How did you find it? Where are your co-supervisors? Did they give you what you wanted and so on. 

01:38:35
MIKE SIMMONS I am conscious that you were asking them to put words down. 

01:38:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm…Hmm… 

01:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS But you don’t actually do anything with the words. 

01:38:40
BRIGID PROCTOR No. I mean we don’t even note the words on. 

01:38:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP No. 

01:38:45
BRIGID PROCTOR As they display the… 

01:38:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And I think we usually encourage people to take the drawings home with them and the words may be important… important to them, yeah but of course where I suppose focusing much more on the drawing. 

01:38:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

01:39:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Well, then and what's interesting of course were the fish they were so many I mean people can translate as jelly fish. Have all sorts of you know, different shapes and sizes. 

01:39:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Between anything and between shark and a jelly fish. 

01:39:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:39:15
MIKE SIMMONS With shrimp. 

01:39:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:39:15
MIKE SIMMONS I guess what I’m seeing is the importance of them reflecting on what they doing. 

01:39:20
Yes. 

01:39:20
MIKE SIMMONS …more than you reflecting on what's doing… 

01:39:25
Yes. 

01:39:25
MIKE SIMMONS And I guess that ties them with what you saying about the work that they are doing. 

01:39:30
That’s right. 

01:39:30
MIKE SIMMONS The work that you are doing. You are holding the process. 

01:39:30
That’s right. 

01:39:35
MIKE SIMMONS In which they are working. You just check that every ones okay with every one else seeing their fish. 

01:39:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

01:39:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, good manners in the group. 

01:39:45
BRIGID PROCTOR I suppose we are always modeling… 

01:39:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Respect… Respect… 

01:39:50
BRIGID PROCTOR …client to model good manners. 

01:39:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …respect I think isn’t it there in the group yes we say. So we do sometime I actually mentioned good manners in the group as part of the in working agreement really and that’s seems a bit. 

01:40:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And encouraging self-protection. 

01:40:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:40:05
BRIGID PROCTOR So its okay to self protect, you don’t have to be defensive. 

01:40:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:40:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

01:40:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …in the way it’s often used. 

01:40:10
MIKE SIMMONS Unconscious you are working at an edge where people endlessly like to be revealing more of themselves then they expected to and some times more than selves then they wanted to and you just giving them the chance to acknowledge that and decide what they want to do about it. 

01:40:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Absolutely. 

01:40:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Because that’s one of the big things and that… the people fear in groups. I think that they’re going to be exposed. 

01:40:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. 

01:40:40
I think it was helpful to have the option when asking the co-supervisors what they wanted. 

01:40:45
BRIGID PROCTOR You’re right. 

01:40:45
Because they actually made you think about what you wanted. 

01:40:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Hahaha… 

01:40:50
And that becomes good in touch with all this presenting, what did I want in bringing this issue. So by asking them. 

01:41:00
BRIGID PROCTOR It did real help. 

01:41:00
It helped. 

01:41:00
I felt quite an emotional response to such lengths and when I first closed my eyes and thought of the clients, it was very dark and I feel now as though it’s okay, it seems safer, umm… because I don’t feel as though perhaps that I’m in the dark anyway the clients likes to have been, its okay. Because that’s… that’s why they’re my client. Umm… But I think having the co-supervisors see my client represented like that and… and identify things help to reassure me that I was looking at same picture of the like. 

01:41:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Right, and they were on, that sounds if they were on target. 

01:41:55
Yes, yeah. 

01:41:55
Yes, I feel that umm… you know it… it was quite a… a strong exercise. In the sense that umm… I didn’t know why I drew my client really too much like that. Umm… And it was more than actually likened ah… my client to this dolphin. I’m like, I didn’t actually draw the dolphin. 

01:42:25
Hmm… 

01:42:25
And she said but he doesn’t seem to be able to do what dolphins do. I was really… I hope no, and I just was so amazed by that comment… 

01:42:35
Hmm… 

01:42:35
…because it really answered a question of meaning. It was amazing. It’s absolutely amazing. And it was, yeah, a really kind of… ah… you know, point of learning. 

01:42:50
Yeah. 

01:42:50
And it has answered really quite a strong question. It’s… I haven’t actually done that before. 

01:43:00
BRIGID PROCTOR You have to know now how to put the question. 

01:43:00
Yeah, trying to put really. Yes. 

01:43:05
Yes, and… and I had… I was really puzzled by it and what you said about being split, it… it didn’t belong to, and what I’ve realized it… it’s… I’ve drawn my fish like that, but I think it’s explained what's happening for being which is really strange. 

01:43:30
Hahaha… 

01:43:35
BRIGID PROCTOR So it really helped you what's in her and what’s through him and what's in you. 

01:43:40
Yes. 

01:43:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah! And do you notice how everybody can do very simple things. You know you don’t have to be clever or experienced. You… We know so much. We’ve been in the world so long, from the moment we’ve been born interacting with our caress women in the playground and everything. We know, so it doesn’t what you’ve learnt from the book, it’s what you know and it’s difficult… 

01:44:10
Let’s see it. 

01:44:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

01:44:15
(Inaudible ) here. 

01:44:16
BRIGID PROCTOR I do apologize. 

01:44:20
I… I find it so insightful because the same thing how my subconscious events of my relationship with this client is very different to what's really going on. And so it was just the, yeah I kind of felt quite surprised but it’s quite positive. So I felt quite happy. 

01:44:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Happier. That we don’t know we know… 

01:44:45
Hmm… 

01:44:45
BRIGID PROCTOR …such a lot of the time because it didn’t polite him. We talk about good group manners, but the good manners we take to working with clients are often the good manners we’re bringing from outside. You mustn’t notice things that are difficult. I mustn’t feel ashamed. And I mustn’t feel you know, or she or… I mustn’t notice that she is rather an unpleasant person. Those things and somehow it’s, I hope one of the reasons that we use this exercise and we didn’t invent it somebody else invented it, called Margaret Gallagher and I would like to get for the… the credit for it. It somehow licenses us to realize what we know (inaudible ) ourselves know. And do it respectfully. Nobody felt their client was disrespected by this. Do you (inaudible )? All though they are colleague, I don’t know whether… but they’re clients or they, some of them colleague? 

01:45:45
No, mine is colleague. 

01:45:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Colleague Hmm… So thank you very much. 

01:45:50
Thank you a lot. 

01:45:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It reminds you that you can do this yourself at home. It’s a real good self-supervision like you always do it after a client or anything if you want to… That’s what you can do it and bring it next time, when you come… when you come to a group. 

01:46:10
BRIGID PROCTOR You could bring a fish here. 

01:46:10
Well, I think the sharing is very important. 

01:46:15
Yes. 

01:46:15
Okay, thanks. 

01:46:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, go on to the next class. 

01:46:20
Thank you. 

01:46:20
2nd Client Presentation The Five Eyed Model 

01:46:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP You’re all getting very brilliant now of being able to hear each other and feedback exactly what the other person has said so that you’re really showing that you’re listening and I thinking you’re also finding yourselves and that is really helping you to resolve confusion and to hear was this old saying that says I don’t know what I mean until I hear what I say. 

01:46:45
Hmm… 

01:46:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And sometimes that hearing back again is really helpful. But I want to move on into being able to do that as well but also to be able to focus on what we’ve called a five or a seven-eyed model of supervision. We adapted Peter Hawkins’ original model and then adapted it into… 

01:47:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And Robin Shohet. Peter Hawkins and Robin Shohet. 

01:47:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Robin Shohet model, yes. And we’re just going to use today the five eyes. And just to remind you about it I’d like to do just a little demonstration and if we can move a table first of all could we? Could you just move the table out of the way, okay. 

01:47:30
[sil.] 

01:47:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And could two of you just bring your chairs into the middle and one of you be a client and one of you be a counselor. You’re not going to client or you’re not going to counsel her, but you are just going to take that role. So just bring your chair into here, put further in, right in so that you’re facing each other as if you are… as if we are in session. Well, this is to remind you the five different areas in which you can focus. We’ve call them five eyes or five focusing and which is… which are you, were you the counselor or the client? 

01:48:10
I’d be the counselor. 

01:48:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP You’re the counselor. 

01:48:10
Yeah. 

01:48:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:48:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, and you’re the client. 

01:48:15
Eye 1 The Client’s Story 

01:48:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay! So focus number one is the client. That’s a normal focus and that’s often the focus that you bring all the time, the history of the client, anything about the client. Client’s relationships, the client. So that’s number one focus, number one eye, okay. Number two is the… Would you just sort of hold up and say this is what you’re actually doing. 

01:48:40
Eye 2 What the Counsellor did 

01:48:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP This is what you are doing to the client. The responses she might be making, the techniques she might be using if you are a gusto you might be doing chair techniques or anything. So the… the focus then is on what did you actually do when she said so and so or when you were thinking so and so? What did you actually do? What was your response or what was it about? Okay. 

01:49:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Even what you are working agreement might be… 

01:49:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:49:05
BRIGID PROCTOR What… What… What's the contract with client? What she is might be… 

01:49:10
I can do well, yeah. 

01:49:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay. Now could you get up both of you and could you do a little dance with each other? 

01:49:15
I need to dance with people. 

01:49:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, okay, so watch this. Which is this? What focus would this be? 

01:49:30
The relationship. 

01:49:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP The relationship, yes. What's going on between you? What's the dance in the relationship? What are you getting? Yeah. 

01:49:35
Eye 3 The Relationship 

01:49:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So number three is the relationship between you. And number four, if you put your head down Norma, this is, the what's going on inside the counselor. 

01:49:45
Eye 4 Inside the Counsellor 

01:49:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So we are able to focus on what's happening for her? What are you thinking? What do you feeling? What the images you’ve got going on? Anything that may be going on. What theories are you working on? What's happening for you inside? Okay, so you can see the four different ways. And number five… Number five is this one. I want room. Just watch. The system. 

01:50:20
Eye 5 The System 

01:50:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP The system you are in, yeah, number five. So, it’s one that’s haven’t been thought of before, but it really often is very important, might be the… might be a partnership you are in, the marriage you’re in, it might be the agency you’re in, anything. There are the culture you are in there. So, that’s number five to focus on as well, okay. 

01:50:45
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:50:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Right, so you can take your chairs back again. 

01:50:45
Thank you. 

01:50:45
Thank you. 

01:50:45
MIKE SIMMONS You were talking about a five-eyed model. 

01:50:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

01:50:50
MIKE SIMMONS And the seven-eyed. 

01:50:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And the seven-eyed, yes. And the seven-eyed includes the relationship with the supervisor and what's going on inside the supervisor. But with the group of counselors that’s more confusing for them. 

01:51:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:51:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP To have that. So we’ve left those two out and just doing the… the ones that they can use within the group. 

01:51:10
MIKE SIMMONS And that’s what you’ve used within a group supervision. 

01:51:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. Now comes the choice. Yeah. You are going to present, aren’t you? 

01:51:20
Yes, it’s fine. 

01:51:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Now you’ve got the client. So you have a choice between one two three and four or you have to decide which… which are the ones you are going to do…Brigid says you do number five, the system. So, let’s give you the first choice. 

01:51:40
Umm… What's going on within the counselor. 

01:51:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP What's going on within the counselor. 

01:51:40
Yeah. 

01:51:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Number four, okay. 

01:51:45
Okay, the three. 

01:51:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP The relationship. 

01:51:45
The relationship. 

01:51:50
And I’ll do two then. 

01:51:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, and that leaves you the client, the history and everything on the… 

01:51:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Okay, I’m fairly happy with this. We can always have another go. That is it’s… it’s getting that focus and remembering to listen hard and to give first of all an empathic response first of all and then to give the… to give the focus that which is a sort of question to Juliet(ph) to go on to moving. You don’t respond first of all. 

01:52:20
Okay. 

01:52:20
BRIGID PROCTOR First you listen to all of them. 

01:52:20
Okay. 

01:52:25
BRIGID PROCTOR And then you choose one at the end to respond to. One which perhaps you find might be most useful at that moment then. And then you go on again and to another. 

01:52:30
Okay. 

01:52:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Go a bit more about the type of the client and then we have another go at the second one, okay. 

01:52:40
Hmm…Hmm… I think so. I’m little anxious. Starting to feel that. 

01:52:45
Right my client is a young man who I’ve seen seven times already. He has recently decided that umm… he doesn’t want to see me every week. So we’ve contracted now to meet fortnightly. Umm… the very last session he was due to attend, he didn’t and I haven’t heard from him since. So, things are sort of suspended at the moment. Umm… the reason I haven’t contacted him umm… is because I… it… I cant get hold of him directly. Umm… he lives in a hostel and his caress are very protective of him and they initially made the referral and if I make contact I feel it would breach the confidentiality between us. Umm… because he does have a lot of problems trying to disassociate himself with that sort of environment. Umm… so I feel… I feel a little bit in limbo at the moment but even prior to that the client brought very mixed things. He talked a lot about his family and he talked a lot about his dark places and would get very emotional when he talked of his dark places. Umm… but he has difficulty focusing and staying with an emotions. And so the next session he might perhaps talk to me only about umm… videogames and were really resist doing any work if you like in inverted commas and who ever think he is to doing the work because he is maintaining the relationship or being till now he has and I think that’s where my dilemma is at the moment. Perhaps what am I well, how I been doing what am I doing and what will I do next. Umm… with this particular person have I got any choice. I suppose if he doesn’t make contact with me again. 

01:55:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So let’s see we have one response. Not with one, two, three and four going round. 

01:55:20
Eye 1 The Client’s Story 

01:55:20
I wonder if you could tell me a little bit more about your client. About the… the material he brings to you. 

01:55:30
Okay. 

01:55:30
Eye 2 What the Counsellor did 

01:55:30
You don’t quite sure kind of where this seems to be going and… and there was a couple of things that you have actually mentioned and you also talked about this dark… these dark places and I wondered if you perhaps firstly explore that in him and umm… and whether who ever you’d kind of found out where he wanted to go and with his counseling and… and what he would find as a suitable sort of out scan for counseling? 

01:56:05
MIKE SIMMONS It’s quite bad sound there, but I think we can get a bit of sense that there is a blurring of two different eyes going on at that place. 

01:56:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, I wasn’t quite sure if she was taking about interventions or about the client. 

01:56:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:56:20
BRIGID PROCTOR It would be clearer if she had said have you actually talked with him about the dark places? 

01:56:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right, and that would have located it quite clearly. 

01:56:25
BRIGID PROCTOR That intentions. 

01:56:25
MIKE SIMMONS Fine. 

01:56:25
Eye 3 The Relationship 

01:56:30
I was just wondering I picked up you said the you felt limbo. Umm… But I was wondering when you mentioned your client had been playing videogames. Umm… I was wondering if you could think about your relationship within it in the terms of the videogame or what would it be. 

01:56:50
Okay. 

01:56:50
Eye 4 Inside the Counselor 

01:56:50
When I was listening to you I also heard that the word limbo stick out for me as well and I will… I will say since your confusion about what to do next and I wondered when you were talking about having being in limbo and… and having no choice or feeling that there was no choice. I wondered what was going on inside you when you have those feeling. 

01:57:15
Eye 5 The System 

01:57:15
BRIGID PROCTOR I hear that in that story that there is a real difficulty in the relationship your client has with that whole hostile system and she is caress and that somehow the almost as much a problem for you as he… as he is. And I’m wondering if it might be helpful to explore where you think you fit in that kind of system who… who you are for him or who he thinks you are for him within that system of rather over protective caress perhaps. 

01:58:00
Hmm… Okay I’d like to respond to a few of that. I think your questions about the actual client, I feel quite okay in terms of… of sort of who the client is and… and what his… his stuff is and I feel quite secure about knowing that to a certain extend. Umm… and similarly Julie as I have explored those things and that’s been part of the process if you like that… that we worked through. Umm… I think the resistance is in as much as he is he has been continuing the relationship but not umm… following on if you like. Some weeks we’ll do real work and then it will have a couple of sessions where he is not engaging but he is still there with me. so he engages with me at very different levels and because of umm… his sort of medical history if you like he is very rigid and structured in his thinking and so we’ll only work within where he is comfortable with any given time, okay so the challenge… to challenge him to do it differently would be very… very difficult. Umm… I’m sounding very defensive now, I realize it my client and we work. 

01:59:25
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Its when anybody offers to present in the group but this for an exercise there is often this… often make some feel more vulnerable because obviously she has been sent down a bit deeper. 

01:59:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

01:59:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …than she thought. I think the when she was presenting its gone further that and its some… I suppose recognizing the vulnerability and acknowledging it… 

01:59:55
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

01:59:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …to her. 

01:59:55
MIKE SIMMONS I reminded a bit of the client who goes for counseling thinking as who is going to be easy and suddenly finds they are in touch with things they didn’t expect or didn’t realize who they are. 

02:00:10
Limbo… limbo, yes I think I feel my client’s and… and these three reflections sort of molded into one in my mind. My client is in limbo I think that’s some thing that struck me very… very clearly as you were talking. Umm… he is not allowed to make decisions for himself. He is 21-years-old but he has to and he had to umm… the guideline set down by the hostel and his carers and yeah he is 21 and he is bursting to go out into the world. Umm… and so I guess I’m feeling that from him and I feel kind of in limbo with him because I want to enable him to go out but I’m also pushing against the system that is… is holding him back. Umm… They’re my problems. Sometimes they’re my problems. Sometimes I feel really angry with… with the people that and so I think I’ve definitely attempted to make my relationship with him different from all of those and I think this is probably right batch why I am not making contact because I wanted to be absolutely one hundred percent his choice whether he stays, whether he goes, whether he engages or not. Um and then what comes into my mind is umm… but if he really wants to may be feel enable to because he is not usually allowed to. So, yeah so I am back to my limbo. Now my confusion is to… is to what's acceptable or manageable for him within our relationship and within that other scenario that he has to live with and cope with every day 

02:02:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay. Can we have another response. Would you like to start this for you this time around. 

02:02:00
Eye 4 Inside the Counsellor 

02:02:05
As you were talking I was struck about umm… the thing that resonated for me when you were talking was that… that you wanted to give him all of the choice. So I was listening to you say that I was wondering what about the choice for you within the relationship. 

02:02:20
Hmm…Hmm… 

02:02:20
And where were you within client having all the choice. 

02:02:25
MIKE SIMMONS And now you are going around on another round of… 

02:02:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

02:02:30
MIKE SIMMONS …of the five eyes. Would you just carry on or would you tell them and that which point you’d stop? 

02:02:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Probably perhaps to two more rounds then depending on the time. You’ve got well how long with first bits have taken there, but umm… you’ve always got to remember that in a… in the time you’ve got to leave enough time for them to use their own clients as well as so you are limiting but if it feels as if they have learnt enough from that time. You might only do one round first time and then perhaps go back again to it… do the exercise again next time with them. 

02:03:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm… 

02:03:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

02:03:05
BRIGID PROCTOR That there was always also be it is just a bit of proper supervision for the person, in addition to be a learning exercise. 

02:03:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

02:03:15
BRIGID PROCTOR It is the supervision. 

02:03:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. 

02:03:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

02:03:15
BRIGID PROCTOR For a person presenting. So it’s really important to make sure she is finished off and got some where she wants to and hasn’t got anymore to do. 

02:03:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, which we don’t show on the video. 

02:03:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

02:03:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It’s all there on helping her move that up and see where she might be going. 

02:03:35
Okay, I was thinking that you… as you were speaking I wasn’t sure if you’d answered the question I said about in videogame. 

02:03:45
Alright. 

02:03:45
Your relationship umm… and I was wondering what would it be if you could give him the choice? You know, if you have the magic wand to give him the choice and your relationship how would you do that? 

02:04:00
Eye 5 The System 

02:04:05
BRIGID PROCTOR And as I heard you talking then about it umm… it is… it is… I was wondering if you’d like to… to think about yourself in a way as an anti-system. It’s… It’s as if you are setting yourself up as a counter culture, but I am not saying you are setting yourself up, but it’s almost as if there is an urge to set yourself up and sometimes you do as a count culture and sometimes umm… But there is some reluctance in you to do that. So that it’s somehow exploring a bit more of where you think you stand in relation in that system. 

02:04:50
Okay. 

02:04:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Somehow. 

02:04:50
Eye 2 What the Counsellor did 

02:04:55
You mentioned as well about that your clients came (inaudible ) sometimes and then sometimes didn’t do any work umm… and you sort of said that’s you know for you that’s… that’s absolutely fine. You go to just deal with what he wants. I wonder if you’d actually put that to him about what's actually happening that we are working some times what you know, why… why is it that we are working some times, what makes it for working some times and what makes it for not working some times. Perhaps just to try and get some idea about those two differences. 

02:05:40
Eye 1 The Client Story 

02:05:45
Yeah… It strikes me as… as I was hearing you that you are trying to give him choice but he does doesn’t have much choice. He doesn’t have much. Certainly doesn’t have lock in his big system and it’s quite limited choice that he has with you, that’s how it’s sounding. 

02:06:05
Hmm…Hmm… Yes, I feel I want to umm… How do I want? If I had a magic wand he would… he’d be free… he’d be free to make his choices and take responsibility but he is not allowed to take responsibility umm… for… for his action over anything really and i guess that’s what I’ve been doing is allowing him to be responsible for what he brings and not challenging it. Yeah, so I’ve been trying to give him that. I could only like to answer your previous videogame question because when he does only bring me videogames I find it very difficult to be sort of motivated myself within this sessions. Its not something I am so good at. We talk star wars sometimes and that’s okay but the magic wand, yes. I want to like I want to give you his freedom. Umm… I believe in him… I believe that he is capable of a lot more back to the… the system that counter culture, yes. So I guess I’d be umm… in a different relationship with him as an advocate perhaps I would be I would see me rallying against the system. But that isn’t the role I have with him and it wouldn’t be productive I don’t think at the moment because I think he has got to do his own rallying and perhaps that’s what I can be… I can be part of that process of enabling him to do his own rallying become his own advocate and then find the… the words to use umm… I think he is very… very articulate. But he is not heard. I think he is not heard. Well that brings me back to contacting him its very difficult but also if he is chosen not to come, I need to hear that as a very clear message I think. But he has made a decision and that's… that’s okay. Some resort. Hmm… Thank you. 

02:08:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay, there is enough… 

02:08:45
Hmm… 

02:08:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …for you. 

02:08:45
Yeah, thank you. 

02:08:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Okay. Okay, any comments on this exercise? 

02:08:55
[sil.] 

02:09:00
It was… I find it really helpful as I was listening to what she was saying. I was able to sort of take my head to the different places disowning and then so night. And that was just… that was really helpful being up there for own the different hats and look from all those different perspectives. 

02:09:15
So you were using all the hats as well as yours? 

02:09:20
Yeah, I was going around you then. Yeah. 

02:09:25
I did want to go as police says than… than just a client I wanted to sort of switch roles. 

02:09:30
Your choices like this would have been what longer? 

02:09:35
Umm… Yeah, what… what Lynda(ph) was doing there. 

02:09:40
The relationship. 

02:09:40
The relationship, yes I think so because… 

02:09:40
It’s that you are normal. 

02:09:45
Yes, because… because that is what I was… I was switching back before that I had to keep on thinking like back to the client… back to the client. 

02:09:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes. Was that because of this particular client or is it that is your normal way of thinking? As you are listening, you are normally thinking about the relationship. 

02:10:00
I am thinking about the relationship, I think yeah. 

02:10:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP See I think Peter Hawkins said that we all have a way of focusing. Umm… It’s recognizing what's your own focus is normally and then beginning to be that’s from the group and helping each other. Now and know these on working on these focus and what I would like you to do before you come next time, is with your next client will you record under all those five headings… 

02:10:35
Alright. 

02:10:40
Hmm… 

02:10:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So what you are recording, I mean your normal things are recording about the clients, aren’t they, spot off? 

02:10:45
Yeah. 

02:10:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hopefully, you record what you do but not necessarily you may not actually if you really begin to think, lets say what did I do at that point or what was I thinking or notes what I making and then thinking… thinking about the relationship and notice how really just to use metaphor. 

02:11:00
Hmm… 

02:11:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Sometimes I said, we are like the dance, you know dance mean you put them together. 

02:11:05
A videogame. 

02:11:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Why don’t you make the dance with your client? If you were doing a dance with your client how would it be? 

02:11:15
Hmm… It was very difficult actually. I sort of feeling as… as you were talking then it’s reflects in the middle. So I find it difficult to hold everything at once but I actually feel a bit like his big sister. So it’ll be pulling him along dancing, yeah, yeah. 

02:11:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Oh it’s interesting. So could you do that for next time? 

02:11:35
Hmm… 

02:11:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So that when you bring your clients next time you can think about these got though and then you can use each other. You can either choose a different eye next time. So record to that to respond to the next person but it is important to try and do an empathic response with it because it can be quite challenging where and the response softens it whole time and… you know there is something that you… 

02:12:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Can I say one more thing more thing that struck me… 

02:12:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm… Yes. 

02:12:05
BRIGID PROCTOR …because they have the two eyes in that… that is the 7 eyes in that really, and others about the relationship between the supervisor and the counselor, difficult to do in a group because you all have different reactions, and about what's going on inside the supervisor. Anyhow I have to be looking at that whole exercise, with that eye, I could help noticing that normally you are the one that didn't get a choice of eye. You… You are landed with one, because it went around this way. 

02:12:35
Umm… 

02:12:35
BRIGID PROCTOR And you said what to take to and so you took one. And I wondered it seemed to interesting that almost set you up to be in a parallel process almost with the client, who… who umm… didn't have choices and was kind of… 

02:12:55
Hmm… Yes. 

02:12:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …slightly truculent about them but not openly truculent about, about his lack of choice somehow and I wonder if you got a bit landed with that bit of the feeling. 

02:13:05
NORMA Yes. 

02:13:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Just because you didn't have a choice. 

02:13:10
NORMA Yes. 

02:13:10
Hmm… 

02:13:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And if they may not be the case, but it is worth just as an… 

02:13:15
LYNDA MIZEN Hmm… 

02:13:15
BRIGID PROCTOR …illustration of how groups can reflect what's going on in the client. 

02:13:20
NORMA Yes. 

02:13:25
BRIGID PROCTOR And somebody in the group would pick up different bits. 

02:13:25
NORMA Yes. 

02:13:25
BRIGID PROCTOR We will go on to the next class. 

02:13:25
Umm… 

02:13:25
Thank you, yes. 

02:13:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, I think it’s your turn Norma isn't it to bring a client. 

02:13:30
3rd Client Presentation The Sculpt 

02:13:35
NORMA I have been working with this among through about certain sections now, and his wife died very suddenly in August, umm… they were out shopping and he was in a hurry to get home, he is a huge Cricket fan, and couldn't wait to get home because the match was on. It was a big cross, no not a bit, he was very cross(ph) of his wife because she was you know, wanted to get this patent(ph) up bit, so they eventually got home and he said I am going to watch the cricket, make me a cup of tea, and he sat there for a while and he thought where is my cup of tea? So he walked out into the kitchen and his wife was slumped over the kitchen table, and he said I did nothing, I went back into the living room, and I watched the match, the cricket match until it ended, and then I went back into the kitchen and she was still on the table and he went up to and acknowledged what he knew the first time was that she had died. And it was then that he phoned, phoned his doctor, and on the whole system came into place and… and he tells me that he coped with everything, ranged everything, he has one son, and lives at North of Scotland, and he came down, but he, he was… he was sort of in automatic pilot, and she says I, I do these things very well, he was a solicitor and you know, knows how to do things by the book, hmm… and I'm… it… it was over… over the… the months went by, the funeral was over, the months went by and he went to the doctors because he wasn't… he wasn't sleeping at all, and he was having very bad dreams, so the doctor suggested that he comes to the agency would you like to talk to somebody and he was a bit reluctant to start off with, but umm… the lack of sleep was sort of really getting to him and so eventually turned up at the agency and, and that's where I have been looking with him, and when I heard, what he had to say specially about you know ignoring because he… he chose to ignore that his wife was dead, I saw oh my goodness, he is… he is really going to… something is going to crash down with him. I expected him to get very emotive and very emotional about it, but I think one session after the other he just goes back over the same ground, he says the same thing, and he says it in… in a very much a fact way as if he is reporting it, almost says it would forward and he feels… what it feels to me that he is very, very stuck. He can't… He can't go further and telling me the same thing, we got to wake(ph) and I am feeling very stuck with it… 

02:17:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm…Huh… 

02:17:40
NORMA …because I don't quite know how he should move on, you know we have… we've learned all these things about different stages of grief, and… but, I didn't know that its helpful for people to experience a grief but he is not, he is just saying that same, same story, over and over again, and I am really worried that's all that he will do, when our time will be up. I am feeling quite, here quite stuck with him, and am I thought that bring down here, because I had… 

02:18:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Hmm… 

02:18:30
…I don't know where to go from here, and I really don't know where to go. 

02:18:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Can we freeze that for a second in a whole but and you stay with that story in silently for a few minutes. We really struck passing, he goes over the same ground you know… 

02:18:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… 

02:18:50
BRIGID PROCTOR I am wondering, if that at least one of them could take the repetitive of him, and start just walking around the group, so I am had just walking, and I was thinking, [oh. noticed] I was thinking more about the bits of him, then about the bits of Norma somehow. 

02:19:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm…Huh… 

02:19:15
BRIGID PROCTOR And I was wondering if people could pick up the different part and (inaudible ) two or three parts of him really, um.. and they could, may be Norma could be him going round and round in different bits of him put care and, and walk around with her and this bit of him and what happens to me as this, and that, and then we stop someone see what happens. 

02:19:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm…Huh… 

02:19:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Does that sound… Does it… 

02:19:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah, I was… 

02:19:45
BRIGID PROCTOR You think… 

02:19:45
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …thinking about unspoken. 

02:19:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm…Huh… 

02:19:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I’m thinking about supposing you tried speaking what they think is unspoken of his… 

02:19:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, of his going around. 

02:19:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm…Huh… 

02:19:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

02:20:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP And of Norma's too. 

02:20:00
BRIGID PROCTOR And of Norma's. And the only thing, what I am really wondering about is what the Norma ought to be in it… 

02:20:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm…Huh… 

02:20:05
BRIGID PROCTOR …or sitting back and watching it, so that it would help… I mean, she’s stuck and (inaudible ) she is neither in it nor is she out of it. 

02:20:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

02:20:15
BRIGID PROCTOR And I wonder if you are thinking the better her being in it more out of it. 

02:20:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP So, she have a charge. 

02:20:20
BRIGID PROCTOR Oh, that's a good idea! So right, you heard what we were talking about in general, and you have heard that the, the big issue is resort about doing something a bit active with this, and it certainly going to bring diversity into the group I mean… 

02:20:40
Hmm… 

02:20:40
BRIGID PROCTOR …there may be some cricket fans but they are not men. Would you prefer to go further in, and experience him or would you prefer that other people did that for you and you stayed outside and heard and watched it. 

02:21:00
NORMA I think I would like to stay outside and watch it. 

02:21:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. That's fine, stick with, stick with it the sense you have… 

02:21:05
NORMA Yes, yes. 

02:21:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …because we can know as you to the later stage, if you want to go in, you can go in. 

02:21:10
NORMA Yes. 

02:21:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

02:21:10
MIKE SIMMONS So, there has been a bit of an issue about a… what Norma does, is she in or is she out… 

02:21:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Umm… 

02:21:20
MIKE SIMMONS …and then in the end, you leave her to make the choice. 

02:21:25
BRIGID PROCTOR That's enough, but there is what I would normally do, I think it is another instance of where somehow a feeling constricted to do something that I planned to do before hand. 

02:21:35
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

02:21:35
BRIGID PROCTOR I am sure, it was a very wise choice that she took, to sit out with such a powerful exercise to go in would have been overwhelming, I think she recognized that. 

02:21:45
MIKE SIMMONS So she, she stayed where it was safe and appropriate for us to be? 

02:21:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes! And where she could get a perspective on it. 

02:21:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. If she had been inside, she’d have been overwhelmed and had perhaps not learned very much. 

02:21:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Caught in the parallel process of going round and round, I guess. 

02:22:00
NORMA Okay. 

02:22:05
BRIGID PROCTOR So, we know that you’re going just sit there, and we want other people to be on the stage, this is the stage we have really and I wonder if, if as you heard that story, you could pick up different bits of him, not Norma at the moment, just him… and… and choose to identify with that particular bit of him, so has anyone got a bit they could identify we are straight away, would like to try? 

02:22:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

02:22:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

02:22:35
BRIGID PROCTOR Who is going to go first? 

02:22:40
JULIA MARTIN Umm… Actually, I sense it a big lock of guilt and shame. 

02:22:45
BRIGID PROCTOR So, that's him really isn't it? Now, I would like you to stand up for a minute. 

02:22:50
JULIA MARTIN Okay. 

02:22:50
BRIGID PROCTOR And then… 

02:22:50
JULIA MARTIN Okay, yeah, I see it has been scrunched up. 

02:22:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, I want you to walk… 

02:22:55
JULIA MARTIN Stand up, walk. 

02:22:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Because the image she used very strongly as he goes round and round, in the same… in the same place, kind of thing. So, somehow think to actually do it. 

02:23:05
JULIA MARTIN Okay. 

02:23:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Would be helpful, and you might have some information from inside that. 

02:23:10
JULIA MARTIN You better crouch up and walk, okay. 

02:23:10
The Husband The Guilty One 

02:23:10
JULIA MARTIN I just get the feeling of the guilt and the shame and I go round in circles because I can't see a way out of it. 

02:23:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. So it's time still a second, we will get you doing that again. What practice? What part of him does anybody else notice his, as one of his sub-personalities, if you like? 

02:23:35
Well, he couldn't sleep continuously. 

02:23:40
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

02:23:40
I’ve noticed. He was unable to sleep because he was having (inaudible ). 

02:23:45
NORMA Yes. 

02:23:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. So if you would like to stand up and put yourself in relation into Julia. 

02:23:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Right, and do a little bit of moving around. Okay, you can stop now. 

02:24:00
The Husband The Unsleeping One 

02:24:05
LYNDA MIZEN I had his vision of him focusing on something and related to his relationship with his wife, the cricket. 

02:24:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. So you go and be the cricket fanatic in this central scenario. 

02:24:20
The Husband The Cricket Fanatic 

02:24:20
LYNDA MIZEN Do I have to walk around. 

02:24:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Not necessarily, no, do what you think its right. Alright. 

02:24:30
MIKE SIMMONS So he turns his back and that so as if we lost him in some way. 

02:24:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP We haven't lost him, but back is very powerful. 

02:24:40
MIKE SIMMONS I guess, I am… we always have a sense of… of his presence within the sculpt, he is always there. 

02:24:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP He is always, he is always there, and somewhere there is the… the squareness of it, that's seemed ripe, very powerful now. 

02:25:00
MIKE SIMMONS I guess turning a back on someone is a powerful act, isn't it? 

02:25:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Hmm… 

02:25:05
I was really struck by the thought of him, that was just so shocked, he didn't do anything, he was frozen, didn't that moment of seeing her. 

02:25:15
The Husband The Shocked One 

02:25:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. So, where would, Where would that be? 

02:25:20
In here, I think. 

02:25:25
BRIGID PROCTOR I understand. 

02:25:25
And Stretched. 

02:25:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, they are going to go round and round. because they don't stay still, so where can you be that allows them, to do their going round and round? 

02:25:40
[sil.] 

02:25:45
I suppose may be in between those two. 

02:25:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

02:25:45
I mean in front of (inaudible ). 

02:25:50
Uh…Huh… 

02:25:50
BRIGID PROCTOR Now, you have to keep going round and round due to… 

02:26:00
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I want to speak… 

02:26:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Uh…Huh… Now stop, and now I want you each to speak from where you are what you, what's happening for you, tell… tell us what's happening for you, starting in order that you went. 

02:26:25
The Husband The Guilty One 

02:26:25
JULIA MARTIN I feel heavy. I feel encumbered. I can't free myself from any of it. 

02:26:30
The Husband The Unsleeping One 

02:26:35
I am on you, I am with you, I am own for you, all the time, all the time, permanently, perpetual, and locked in, and you won't get rid off me, you won't get rid of me. 

02:27:05
[sil.] 

02:27:05
The Husband The Cricket Fanatic 

02:27:10
LYNDA MIZEN Oh! my god she's dead or I just keep watching the television, watching the cricket will be alright. Oh god! I don't know what to do? Just stay here, just stay, watch the television, or keep it normal, keep it normal, Oh my god! (inaudible ) to jail. 

02:27:26
The Husband The Shocked One 

02:27:30
I am frightened, its massive, its crushing me, I can't move, I can't breathe, I can't do anything, my legs are like stone. 

02:27:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Is there anything you would like to ask? Any of those people, or would you? Yes. 

02:27:55
NORMA I think I would say to… 

02:28:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Get up, get up, and stand at whatever distance you don't have to go right up, if you don't want whatever, wherever you want to stand in relation to the cricket watcher. 

02:28:10
NORMA Well, I think to come closer to her. 

02:28:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Alright. 

02:28:20
[sil.] 

02:28:25
NORMA Think on to say, don't be frightened, Don't be frightened. You did go back. You couldn't do at the first time (inaudible ). 

02:28:45
[sil.] 

02:28:50
NORMA I mean, it’s so heavy. I couldn’t see that. And I couldn't say that to my client. 

02:29:00
BRIGID PROCTOR You couldn't say it to your real client. Freeze a second. 

02:29:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think there was also something about that we parted, we had row, shopping and we caught at the last mile, (inaudible ) very unkind. 

02:29:25
BRIGID PROCTOR So, and that is in this sculpture, that we haven't had the angry man, and we hadn't had the solicitor and we don't have enough people in the group to do that, so where if you had an angry man in the solicitor, which I imagine some of his resourcefulness, in a way, what would you like to do with those two, what would you, how would you put those two. 

02:29:50
NORMA See angry man. 

02:29:50
BRIGID PROCTOR The angry man in the solicitor, the automatic doer, I am the angry man. 

02:30:00
[sil.] 

02:30:10
NORMA The angry man should be here. 

02:30:10
The Husband The Angry Man 

02:30:15
NORMA Pretty certain this is the visit of his anger. 

02:30:15
JULIA MARTIN Guilt and shame. 

02:30:20
NORMA Yes, yes. That's where the angry, he should be facing you and telling. 

02:30:30
JULIA MARTIN to ready feel as better haven't someone look at me. 

02:30:35
NORMA Yes. 

02:30:35
JULIA MARTIN Umm… 

02:30:40
NORMA As long as you are sitting here, this is going to go on, and on and on, comes like umm… deal with me. And I am angry for you. I am angry with you for leaving me. Angry for leaving. 

02:31:05
BRIGID PROCTOR You being the wife… You being the wife, when you say I am angry with you for leaving me. 

02:31:10
NORMA Yes, you are the one. You’re my wife and you shouldn't have gone. I am feeling blamed because of I happened to watch that insulting(ph) cricket, and you might still be alive. I am not angry because I have to run away… 

02:31:25
The Husband The Solicitor 

02:31:30
NORMA I am a solicitor, doesn't run away, solicitor always does his duty. 

02:31:40
[sil.] 

02:31:45
NORMA and I didn't block do my duty by you, so I’m confused as well as I’m in grief. 

02:31:55
BRIGID PROCTOR I think, this is a powerful exercise, umm… even role played people who are amazingly engaged with it, taken into it really, umm… as I watch it, I feel very uneasy, doesn't feel to me like an elegant piece of work at all. And I find myself, feeling judged as a Norma was probably feeling judged about what she wasn't she didn't feel she was doing well. And all along the line, I found myself making choices, and at that point, where they were going round and round and became aware that I had made them go round and round from my picture in my head, made up my rules in sculpting would be, that they know where to go and what to do, which they do… 

02:32:50
MIKE SIMMONS Umm… 

02:32:55
BRIGID PROCTOR …but my anxiety made them go that might be taken up for this round and round, and it felt to me that at that stage, that there were just going to repeat the process that Norma had talked about, and I could see no resolution and I realize how much I wanted there to be resolution… 

02:33:10
MIKE SIMMONS Umm… 

02:33:10
BRIGID PROCTOR …and I had any gender in mind, and really throw their important note to have an gender in mind, when you are doing experiential exercise, I think. Is that right? 

02:33:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, you some actually need to help some or the other that she want something to happen as a result of it, but it wouldn't be point in setting it up, and now, and that she want to see a some… 

02:33:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Some movement. 

02:33:35
FRANCESCA INSKIPP some movement, yes. Umm… 

02:33:35
MIKE SIMMONS This is how that you are saying what you might have done is give them more choice about what they wanted to do, in that situation 

02:33:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, yes. Uh…Huh… Yes. I knew at that time, that I was feeling my way and doing the next thing, I thought might move things on, watching it I am extremely aware of that, and that somehow its almost as if you are moving in the dark, and jut thinking what could the next thing be, that might shed light for everybody, from me everybody, Norma on this process, um.. I mean I suppose it kind of worked, let did happen and I suppose you might call out the parallel process, umm… it just not make [really good working.] So haven't got much more time, so I want you to unwind and go out again, stand behind your chair. So you are, you are right out of it, and I just want to de-role these people, I almost forgot her. I want to de-role these people and then we can come back and see where you not stand with it? I am going to de-role you first. I want you to walk away from that. What's your name? 

02:35:05
JULIA MARTIN Julia. 

02:35:10
BRIGID PROCTOR In what way do you identify with this man? In what way are you different? 

02:35:15
JULIA MARTIN Umm… 

02:35:20
MIKE SIMMONS And now you’re de-roleing them? 

02:35:25
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, Ah… I was struck a very powerful that was for all of them and for me, and umm… it, I think in any experiential work, its extremely important for people to take the time to help people get back into themselves and that I am thinking should leave it, unless you are satisfied, I have done that in some way. 

02:35:50
MIKE SIMMONS I guess, I was… I was reminded of this start of this session, the very start of the session… 

02:35:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Uh…Huh… 

02:35:55
MIKE SIMMONS …the health and safety. 

02:35:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

02:35:55
MIKE SIMMONS This is how we are going to work, this is the arrangement. 

02:36:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

02:36:00
MIKE SIMMONS And it is almost say, that was one book end. 

02:36:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah. 

02:36:05
MIKE SIMMONS And this was another book end. 

02:36:05
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes. 

02:36:05
MIKE SIMMONS Bringing them back to safety. 

02:36:10
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, that's very nice, yes. 

02:36:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…Huh… 

02:36:10
BRIGID PROCTOR And that's right. So, where are you now Norma? 

02:36:15
De-roleing has now taken place 

02:36:20
NORMA Yes, I think able to… I think, able to go back and trying and tell him to how he is feeling, not just what he is doing. 

02:36:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Right. 

02:36:35
NORMA That's being hard, hmm… 

02:36:45
BRIGID PROCTOR And words(ph) still be hard. 

02:36:50
NORMA Yes, yes. yeah, because I came into this umm… because somebody close to me hugged at it. It was a long, long time ago, and I thought that it was over, I worked through it, umm… but somehow this man has sent me back into that same place of not been able to do anything, set go round and round and round. Umm… Thank you. 

02:37:35
[sil.] 

02:37:40
BRIGID PROCTOR So, I really want to hear what you have to say about the intensity of that, because it seems to me that's like, that's where the feeling access is? 

02:37:50
LYNDA MIZEN As to me, as Lynda taking on the role, when I turned my chair around, I wanted to demonstrate, that this, that the cricket watching was a apart, apart from him, that it wasn't a choice, that was sense I picked up, however when I was asked to respond from that part, I felt physically sick, very very cold, and it was if, I just going into the kitchen and come out, again I was sitting there overwhelmed by that feeling, and I guess that came out in my voice, because I felt very panicky, that I had found and I was just sling between, this is an exercise that we are doing, this is supervision, but the feelings were there, and I felt very very shaky, I am feeling much better now, I have turned around, and I am at the group and I am hearing and that I am feeling safer, but I wanted to communicate that with you. Norma but perhaps there was something that was going on for him now. 

02:38:55
NORMA Uh…Huh… 

02:38:55
LYNDA MIZEN When I was there, I was in it. 

02:38:55
BRIGID PROCTOR And I really felt it, I mean. I thought I was going to cry. 

02:39:00
Umm… 

02:39:00
BRIGID PROCTOR The feeling you only had said three words for it. It is just really, I just could feel that kind of that degree of you know, but it wasn't sickness it was grief, it was chocking with, with the grief in here. Did you feel it? 

02:39:20
Yeah, yeah. 

02:39:20
LYNDA MIZEN And I suppose, I am thinking about that it sort of moving off a little bit, but it scares a little bit, it’s as we’re learning as students the intensity of, of some other work we do. 

02:39:35
Hmm… 

02:39:40
BRIGID PROCTOR I am wondering about the focus I have, I want to say to you as being concerned for you as carrying over that, the others who carry the frozen in a way, but you carried… 

02:39:50
LYNDA MIZEN Umm… 

02:39:50
BRIGID PROCTOR What was, what wasn't expressed, do you feel you will be able to leave that aside here, that's better when you turned round, will it give you, won't give you sleepless nights. 

02:40:00
LYNDA MIZEN No, it… it won't give me… No it won't give me sleepless nights. 

02:40:05
BRIGID PROCTOR That's what, that's what I am trying to… 

02:40:05
LYNDA MIZEN No, no, I am better, and… and… as each moment is going on, I am feeling better. 

02:40:10
BRIGID PROCTOR How about you? 

02:40:15
NORMA I think it will be better, now that I know what it is about, because that is what I have to be with, is this pain and I have done much on my work, you just through me back and I think, there was something that I recognized about this, that was so similar to mind(ph) and I thought oh! that rather go round and round. 

02:40:45
BRIGID PROCTOR So in a way, you could, you could identify with the game round and round… 

02:40:45
NORMA Yes. 

02:40:50
BRIGID PROCTOR …and you can sympathize… 

02:40:50
NORMA Yes. 

02:40:50
BRIGID PROCTOR …and empathize with that 

02:40:50
NORMA Yes. 

02:40:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Just not attractive. 

02:40:55
NORMA No. 

02:41:00
BRIGID PROCTOR Not stimulating. 

02:41:00
NORMA Yeah. That's where I need to be with him. I am not inside of him. And I chose to do that in this, so how do I… 

02:41:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Well, great because you know what you need. 

02:41:15
Umm… 

02:41:15
Umm… 

02:41:15
Umm… 

02:41:15
NORMA Oh yeah! 

02:41:15
BRIGID PROCTOR You have to trust what you need, not put it down. When I saying about moving exercises is people do know, their bodies know, even if the head doesn't approve of it. 

02:41:25
Umm… 

02:41:30
BRIGID PROCTOR Their bodies know what they need to do. So what Francisco(ph) said give her the chart out, you’re going to give her the choice. 

02:41:30
Uh…Huh… 

02:41:35
BRIGID PROCTOR I was going to have to make that, I was feeling responsible for making a decision. 

02:41:40
FRANCESCA INSKIPP It is not usually my option, I am using that to get on this structure and move it over… 

02:41:45
BRIGID PROCTOR Yeah, yeah. 

02:41:50
FRANCESCA INSKIPP …suddenly, you know, so its really important like you have the choice as to what she did. 

02:41:55
FRANCESCA INSKIPP I think it is very important to recognize that how easily, especially with, because we all tune to empathy, in many ways, how easily we get into about people… 

02:42:10
MIKE SIMMONS And you just giving them the time to reflect on the power of what they experience. 

02:42:15
BRIGID PROCTOR Yes, yes. And again very important, very important to do that… 

02:42:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, because it is almost part of the de-roleing. I think, isn't it, to be able to then talk about the process a bit, which enables them to stand outside it, instead of being… 

02:42:25
BRIGID PROCTOR We’re outside the magnetic field. 

02:42:30
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yes, right, right inside, yes. We’re… Hmm… And to develop that observer, somehow which is so important for them on reflection really to be able to have that observer who can stand outside and see. 

02:42:40
MIKE SIMMONS And I guess for me there is something about watching that bit of the process, by just reflecting on what have we gone through, that may be I think I am important is for counselors, for trainers, for supervisors, to have an awareness about time, that it's always a temptation or may be just for me to cramp lots of things and you cramp lots of things in, they can't be processed. 

02:43:05
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Yeah. 

02:43:05
MIKE SIMMONS And often the processing part is vital. 

02:43:10
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Uh…Huh… 

02:43:10
MIKE SIMMONS Perhaps always it’s vital. 

02:43:15
FRANCESCA INSKIPP Umm… Yes. So may be there should be a health warning, don't start, anything and that she know you have got time to process. 

02:43:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

02:43:20
FRANCESCA INSKIPP That's true. 

02:43:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

02:43:20
BRIGID PROCTOR If people have come out outside the exercise and are able to reflect on it, from a dispassionate place. 

02:43:30
MIKE SIMMONS Brilliant Francesca, it has been an extraordinary day, we have watched this video. I wonder if this one is the hottest days of the year in the studio. Ah… It has been fascinating to watch how you worked and to hear how you reflect on your work. Thank you very much. 

02:43:55
BRIGID PROCTOR Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity. 

02:43:55
