Lilian Borges, MA, LPC 

00:00:30
LILIAN BORGES Hello everybody. 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:00:35
LILIAN BORGES How is the conference going? Good. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN Great. 

00:00:40
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Awesome. My name is Lilian Borges and umm… today I'm gonna do a clinical demonstration with Thesa(ph) Did you sign uh… 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN I signed. 

00:00:50
LILIAN BORGES Okay. So my demonstration is going to be about how to incorporate experiential techniques with hypnosis. That's what I do, that's what I do uh… seeing my patients, I see so many patients a day and that's how I practice psychotherapy. Umm… what I'm gonna do today is use one specific technique which is the sculpting and we call it, Jeff and I call it therapist sculpting which is an experiential technique and how to use that in psychotherapy and then also in conjunction with hypnosis. That's what I'm gonna, that's what I'm shooting for when you are doing a demonstration with a person that you've never seen before, things can go a little different from what you planned. But that's, that is my plan and uh… she was very kind to help me today. So Thesa(ph) tell me what do you want to work on here today. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN I'd like to work on my relationship with my baby sister. 

00:02:00
LILIAN BORGES Oh, so. So if this session today is successful how will you be with your sister? How the relationship, how you, you will be different in your relationship with your baby sister? 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN After I put the phone down, I won't feel that umm… tension, sick feeling inside of me. I'll just be able to put the phone down and move on rather than carry on the conversation in my head afterwards. 

00:02:35
LILIAN BORGES What in the relationship with her that gets in the way, are you feeling that way? 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN I feel her desire to be much closer to pull on me and but you'll pretend that she's fine with, I have children and grandchildren and she doesn't have children or grandchildren. So my life is very full and we live far away and when she talks about me on the phone, she acts like it's wonderful that I've got all these people in my life that carry a message is you need to be closer to me. I'm your sister. So I feel that constant tug of… 

00:03:20
LILIAN BORGES And why is that about (inaudible ) because it's your sister, right. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN And that's part of the conflict. It's not a bad thing. 

00:03:30
LILIAN BORGES Oh, it's not a bad thing that your sister wants more love from you. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Because I can't give her the tips of loving that she'd like. She's not my child and I know she'd like to be. 

00:03:45
LILIAN BORGES Okay. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN So, it's not a bad thing, I mean, it's wonderful. 

00:03:50
LILIAN BORGES So, it's not bad that she wants the love but it's bad that she wants what? 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN It's not that it's bad, it's a tension between how much time and energy and love I want to give her and how much she would like to receive from me. So the tension lies inside of me. I already have children and grandchildren and there is a sense of (inaudible ) because I'm not her mother. So… Does that, it's not that it's bad but it's a struggle. 

00:04:35
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Yes. So that is… 

00:04:40
[sil.] 

00:04:50
LILIAN BORGES I would like you to go to one of those times when you hung up the phone over and you talked to her and you felt that in your stomach in your gut. What is that? So when one of those times to your mind, you can close your eyes or have your eyes open, whatever is but I would just like you to bring that to your mind, get to here. When you have so just, just nod so I know that you're there. Yes. Okay so can you describe to me the sensation in your body? 

00:05:40
[sil.] 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Umm… it's like a, like a heaviness, like a dark heaviness. 

00:05:50
LILIAN BORGES Heaviness in your stomach area? 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:50
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Okay. So from zero to ten, how much do you feel that right now? 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN Right now, this minute? 

00:06:00
LILIAN BORGES Right now, when you think about it, how much do you feel it? 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Four or five. 

00:06:05
LILIAN BORGES Four or five. What do you have to do to feel 5.5? 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Not with everybody in the room. 

00:06:20
LILIAN BORGES So now we put a curtain, right and we don't have anybody in the room anymore. Because you really want to feel differently. Not always because of your sister. Right. So when you're getting in touch with this, I would like you to use your imagination and take that energy/feeling out of your body and whenever you're ready you hand it to me. Will that feel good to do so? 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:15
LILIAN BORGES So let's pretend that I'm not Lilian anymore. Okay and I'm turning this way so, let's pretend that I'm not Lilian anymore and that I am that energy inside of you. Okay, so I would like you to help me to be a good representation of how it feels when you have that heaviness in your stomach. Not so much what you do with her but more like how you feel. You feel like, you feel like curling up, or do you feel like jumping up and down, you feel like an emptiness, how does it feel when you have that? So think of me as a piece of clay and you're gonna sculpt me, mold me into a representation of how it feels. 

00:08:15
[sil.] 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN It feels the two opposing parts. So I can explain one and then the other. 

00:08:25
LILIAN BORGES Okay. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN So it's not just one, it's two. So the first one is umm… a deep and profound sadness and, and umm… empathy and pity for the childhood she had and… 

00:08:45
LILIAN BORGES So and it's interesting because I've been doing this for a while and uh… as I resonate with you that's what I first felt is a deep sadness. So let's sculpt the sadness and then we go to the other side. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Do I stand up? Do I as I tell you. 

00:09:05
LILIAN BORGES No, you don't have to. But I would like to have, you to help me so I can be a representation of that sadness. Take your time. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Can I give you the feelings so I don't have to… I'm getting to start crying. 

00:09:25
LILIAN BORGES That's the, that's part of the technique. You giving me the feeling and you see it in me. So you don't have to feel it right now. 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN I'd like you to cover your eyes and weep. 

00:09:40
LILIAN BORGES Should I be standing up or it doesn't matter or sitting down? 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN You're sitting down. 

00:09:50
LILIAN BORGES So it's something like this. 

00:09:55
[sil.] 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:05
LILIAN BORGES Do I have my eyes open, eyes closed? 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, eyes are open, you can see, you are looking at her some of the time and yeah, you, you are seeing her. 

00:10:20
LILIAN BORGES What are the things that go in my mind? What are the thought pattern or the thoughts that are related to this state? When I'm in this state what is that, that also so… 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN I, I, I feel so bad, you don't understand and… 

00:10:40
LILIAN BORGES Feel the sadness. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN And… 

00:10:45
LILIAN BORGES Do you feel her sadness or not really? What is this sadness saying? 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN The sadness is saying I feel so terrible that what you experienced with my mother, with our mother and… 

00:11:05
LILIAN BORGES It feels so sad for all those experiences that we lived through, that she lived through, it's part of our family. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN But I didn't, that I didn't save you or I didn't know or. 

00:11:15
LILIAN BORGES I'm so sad, I couldn't save you. So here, I'm so sad, I couldn't save you. What is the name of this state or feeling, it could be sadness, it could be family sadness, it could be what? 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN It's deeply profound sympathy, not empathy because it's not my but a tremendous. I don't like the word pity but umm… 

00:12:05
LILIAN BORGES …yes, yes. Sympathy. I'm getting out of here. Let's go to the other one. Okay. This is the sympathy, the sadness. You said that there are two things. What else is in there? 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN It's a burden that I'm… 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN I think I'm angry, that's the heaviness. Yeah. 

00:12:45
LILIAN BORGES That is the heaviness. Oh God and now that you said that, I feel it. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:12:50
LILIAN BORGES Okay. Could you help me to be a good representation of that heaviness? So how it feels in your body? 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN It's like, if you swallowed a big stone. 

00:13:00
LILIAN BORGES So how can I represent that? So imagine me, so do we need to transfer that again? I don't think so. But imagine me as a representation of that feeling in your body. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN It's a, you're holding your stomach and it's heavy umm… 

00:13:20
LILIAN BORGES Almost like I, I have an indigestion or something. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:13:25
LILIAN BORGES Right, you ate something, it's not digesting well and… 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN Oh I remember being nine months pregnant and holding my hands underneath because it's this huge that's like having to hold this but that was beautiful but this is like. 

00:13:40
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN I don't want to be pregnant. 

00:13:40
LILIAN BORGES This is not pregnancy. 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN This is not pregnancy. 

00:13:40
LILIAN BORGES Pregnancy is creative. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:13:45
LILIAN BORGES This is something that is, it's almost like I, it's hard for me to digest this. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's hard to digest it. 

00:13:50
LILIAN BORGES So as I am, you know taking this on, I'm just telling you how it feels to me. I'm not saying that's how you have to feel it but that's how it feels to me and what I'm feeling is this heaviness thing that is hard to digest. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:14:05
LILIAN BORGES So what else, so how do I place my hands, my, my body so I can represent that yucky feeling in my stomach? 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN Well, one is holding the yucky and the other one is. 

00:14:20
LILIAN BORGES So it's like this? 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN Please. Just… 

00:14:20
LILIAN BORGES Too much? 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. I don't want to have to keep carrying this and looking at this. 

00:14:25
LILIAN BORGES As I'm doing this what I feel is almost, I'm almost puking. It really get, I really get nauseated. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:40
LILIAN BORGES What is the thought that is related to that? 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN I can't stay here. I immediately go back to here, so I'm so sorry. 

00:14:50
LILIAN BORGES But that is, that's enough, it's too much. It's… 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:55
LILIAN BORGES It's too much. It's something I got, it's too much. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Not my child. 

00:15:00
LILIAN BORGES It's not my child. You're not my child. I can't heal you. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's, it's beyond my ability. It's, you're too big for me. 

00:15:15
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Yes. So when I'm here, umm… I'm gonna tell you a little bit how it feels to me. It feels sick to my stomach. Umm… it feel a little paralyzing. Umm… hard to think really, umm… it feels paralyzing. I want to say no more but I'm already had too much. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:15:45
LILIAN BORGES Right? What is the name of this? 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:15:55
LILIAN BORGES This state or feeling? 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN I hate to see it but burden. 

00:16:00
LILIAN BORGES Burden. It is a burden. Okay. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Is that, yeah. 

00:16:05
LILIAN BORGES Yeah. Yes, yes. So I would like to do one thing here and the way that I see it is those two things combined together in there. Right, that's the congestion is but let me ask you one thing. When I was here and I feel a deep sadness when I'm here. Let me ask you this? How much of this sadness is yours? How much of this sadness is even yours? 

00:16:55
[sil.] 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN It must be a lot because I'm feeling it now. 

00:17:00
LILIAN BORGES Yes and I understand the whole idea of this is my feeling, I have to take responsibility, I am the one who is right feeling this and it's my responsibility. I understand that. Sometimes we are born in families and as children we absorb a lot of the feelings of the family that is going around. We do that out of loyalty. We do that out of being children, not being able to right, recognize. So sometimes a lot of, a lot of times we do absorb the families feelings and I'm asking this because when I was here, I felt, I felt that it might not be completely yours. So I'm asking, I don't have to, I'm not imposing that on you. But I'm just inviting you to think how much of this is yours. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN Are you asking how much of this sadness about my mother is mine? 

00:18:05
LILIAN BORGES How about, about this sadness is yours? 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Umm… everybody. So it's not just for this sister, right. 

00:18:20
LILIAN BORGES Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN It's my mother as well. 

00:18:20
LILIAN BORGES Exactly. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN And my father and my brother and my other sister. 

00:18:25
LILIAN BORGES Exactly, exactly. So if that will be okay with you, I would like you to do a little bit of well change a little bit what we are going to do. You know, I would like you to close your eyes, if that is okay with you Tessa(ph). And I would invite you to take one or two or three easy breath, take one or two or three easy breath and go inside that place that feeling in your stomach. As if you could breath into that feeling and all you have to do really is focus your attention to that region in your body, breathe into that. Not going to your head but staying the focus with that energy feeling. You know, I would like to ask that whatever doesn't belong to you, Tesssa that must be released by now. Whatever belongs to family lineage, whatever belongs to family. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:19:50
LILIAN BORGES That must be released. She doesn't have to carry and digest and heal the whole family and to tell the truth Tessa, as you heal and you let go all that family suffering, you're healing them too. 

00:20:20
[sil.] 

00:20:25
LILIAN BORGES As you heal and let go, your ancestors in your family and your sister will be there happy because you're healing them indirectly to and all you need to do is just breathe in and just let go whatever doesn't belong to you. And there is a peace that is hard to digest isn't it? And what is that is hard to digest? So as you breathe in I'd like you to invite, evoke the higher self into that place, into that feeling and as you breathe in and as you breathe in and you focus your attention and invite the higher self into that feeling, you ask the higher self what is that, that is being hard for me to digest? 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:45
LILIAN BORGES Maybe every time that I talk to my sister that is hard to digest. Maybe it was hard to digest when I was a child. How well does this feel in your stomach? Is it an old feeling or is it a new feeling. How old is the feeling Tessa? It's okay. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:20
LILIAN BORGES How old were you when you first started feeling that? 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
LILIAN BORGES Oh. So we are inviting that two year old in. We are inviting that two year old, we are inviting the higher self, getting those pieces, those parts, those parts of you in alignment. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:05
LILIAN BORGES Is it okay for the two year old let go of the family pain of anything that was hard to digest back then? That's awesome. So I would like you to just keep breathing, just keep breathing. In that place, that's awesome. In that place where you felt you used to feel that heaviness and you're breathing the two year old, your higher self and keep breathing into that place. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:10
LILIAN BORGES For me the higher self is really your soul and you're breathing that in. In your soul or your higher self start getting into alignment with the two year old, do you notice what happens? 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN I start to smile. 

00:24:45
LILIAN BORGES Yes. You can smile again. She can smile again. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:25:00
LILIAN BORGES And what is that energy that start, yes, look at that. You can be a child again, if you can smile, if she can be a child again. You want to open your eyes, don't you, I know it. Oh, that's so lovely. 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:25:20
LILIAN BORGES So tell me, how was it? 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN Huh. Well, first realizing that my sister has become so much like my mother. So she's probably triggering my two year old, every time I talk to her and umm… 

00:25:55
LILIAN BORGES before you go there… 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:25:55
LILIAN BORGES How does it feel in your stomach? 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Oh, it feels much better. 

00:25:55
LILIAN BORGES Isn't it? 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Yes. Oh my God. It's… 

00:26:00
LILIAN BORGES As, as I'm doing this with you, I feel it in my stomach too, so it's just, it's too, but not. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Umm… not, not nearly. 

00:26:10
LILIAN BORGES Not nearly. Okay, so tell me. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN So I, I felt smile, I felt a smile that's very… 

00:26:20
LILIAN BORGES Pretty much of a child. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Two years old yes. And I keep up like dancing when I was moving, it's like do I have to sit. I want to get up. 

00:26:35
LILIAN BORGES Get those moving. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Can I get up and move and have permission to get up and move which would be and you know the two year old couldn't, but I can. 

00:26:45
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN So that's lovely. Umm… and then just realizing what's the present and what's the past is so freeing. 

00:26:55
LILIAN BORGES So freeing. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:00
LILIAN BORGES So I'm gonna stand up again, right. 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:05
LILIAN BORGES I'm gonna stand up again and I would like you to help me to be a good representation of you. Now what is the feeling that you're having now with this two year old then? So if you could describe it what is the feeling that comes. Is this freedom, it's… 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN It's freedom. 

00:27:20
LILIAN BORGES Freedom. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN It's, it's freedom to move. 

00:27:25
LILIAN BORGES To be yourself, you have freedom now to be who you really are. Who you really are. You have freedom now to be who you really are. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN And what do I do with my sister? 

00:27:50
LILIAN BORGES Wait, wait just a second, wait just a second. Hold that thought because I'm going there, I'm not done yet. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Okay.

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:28:00

00:28:05
UNKNOWN It's yeah, it's. 

00:28:10
LILIAN BORGES So how can I represent that Tessa? 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN You'd have to move. 

00:28:10
LILIAN BORGES I'll have to move, okay. So what do I, do I jump up and down or do I? 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN You, you're skipping. 

00:28:15

LILIAN BORGES That's, that's the work that we've done. Right, releasing all that heaviness, right that was imposed to you, that was imposed to your old, (inaudible )to you anymore. You are not old. You release that. Can you feel that we release that? You remember when I said, you released almost everything and I felt that it was still something in there, so I'm wondering, if that's something that is still in there is related to this piece that you just told me. Maybe a believe that you have that with your family or with your sister, you can't that you are increasing, that you are, okay. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Yes. Bound. 

00:30:40
LILIAN BORGES That you are bound. So is that related to that, that is too little. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's the remaining feeling. 

00:30:45
LILIAN BORGES That's the remaining. That is, what is the percentage that from zero to a hundred, what is the percentage that is still there? 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN 14 and a half. 

00:30:55
LILIAN BORGES 14 and a half. 14 and a half. Yes. So not even 15%, it's still there and it's related to what? To a feel that if I am not, if I'm free then what would happen with the family, what would happen with your sister. 

00:31:20
[sil.] 

00:31:25
LILIAN BORGES If I'm completely free, what would happen? If I'm… 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN She would get, she will get ill again. 

00:31:30
LILIAN BORGES She would get ill again and what? 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN And then I will be more bound again. 

00:31:40
LILIAN BORGES If I am, if I am free to be happy then she will get you. Do you mind standing up over there? 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:00
LILIAN BORGES And you are going to be your sister. You are your sister now. Is it okay? 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN Umm… no. 

00:32:10
LILIAN BORGES No, no. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:32:15
LILIAN BORGES You don't want to go there? If you don't I'm, we can go a different way. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Can we go to a front route. I'd rather not get into her. It's, that would undo all the work. 

00:32:30
LILIAN BORGES And that is the 15% that is still there. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:32:35
LILIAN BORGES That is the 15% that is still there. Because what I think is that, if she sees that you have to be, if you have the freedom that someone in the family has the freedom really freedom to be happy, that will have a positive effect on her, not her. 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN Are you saying its effect? 

00:33:10
LILIAN BORGES I say as a believe because I… 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN Then you need to, can I sit down and think? 

00:33:20
LILIAN BORGES Yes, please. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN Say that to me, is that my belief, you think I have or you belief. 

00:33:30
LILIAN BORGES You went up too ahead didn't you? 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN I guess so. 

00:33:35
LILIAN BORGES That was hard for you to get that. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN It was… 

00:33:40
LILIAN BORGES So let's, let's slow down a little bit. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:33:40
LILIAN BORGES Okay, let's take a few steps back. Because what we are doing now is doing a good work that we did here in releasing the family sadness and giving you permission to be happy. And say that you can keep and you can anchor that in your family and in doing so you actually instead of retrain your family in making everybody sick, you are going to have a healing effect on them because you're gonna be like a tuning fork. A different one and I would like you to breathe that in. I can be a healing, healing, I can have a healing effect on my family. Just close your eyes. I don't have to feel their, their feelings. I don't have to try to digest their feelings. I don't have to take that on. What if it doesn't belong to me because when I do that, then I cannot heal other people's feelings. And as I connect with my own higher self, with my soul and I allow myself to be more and more who I am that is when an official for everybody around me. It is good for me and everybody around me that I am free. Free to be happy, free to be me. 

00:35:45
[sil.] 

00:35:55
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Cough that old feeling Tessa. Cough that out of you. What happened? 

00:36:15
[sil.] 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN I don't believe what you said. It's, what you're saying I'd like to believe but my experience is… 

00:36:40
LILIAN BORGES Is different. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Is different that being happy isn't good for my, when I'm happy it's not good for my sister. And I want to believe what you're saying. It sounds, you know, it sounds good. But it's not my experience. 

00:37:00
LILIAN BORGES So I see that there is a part of responsibility or guilt with regarding. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN Responsibility. 

00:37:10
LILIAN BORGES Responsibility. Can you still have the responsibility… 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN And be free? 

00:37:20
LILIAN BORGES Yes. You know, and it sounds like, it sounds like that they are opposites. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:37:30
LILIAN BORGES Right. Responsibility and freedom. But I think that there is a lot of responsibility that comes with the freedom. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN That I can breathe in, if I can have both. 

00:37:50
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Because I can't give up the responsibility. 

00:37:55
LILIAN BORGES No, we are not. 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN I don't want to. 

00:37:55
LILIAN BORGES No and that would mean that you would kind of cut the relationship with her or no, it's not what I'm talking, that freedom is not what I'm talking about. This freedom is a very loving freedom. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:15
LILIAN BORGES Right. I remember, I don't know why but I'm gonna tell you the story but when I, I have my, my daughter umm… when she was two years old, that's why I probably, I'm thinking about this. I remember coming back home, I had a horrible day at school and at work. I used to study and work and umm… and I got home and I just put my stuff on the, on the floor and I went to my, to my bedroom and I sat there and I started crying because I had a horrible day. My two year old came and she kissed me and said, mommy, everything is going to be all right. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Sweet. 

00:39:05
LILIAN BORGES So we all have that since we are born that need for connection and love. But that doesn't need to come with heaviness and burden. It can be a very loving thing but when you are doing that you're not doing this. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
LILIAN BORGES All right. You're doing this and trying that you would do the same. So watching me, as you get the love from me, what moves you not be from you. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:39:50
LILIAN BORGES But your resonance because you are, you know free to be who you are. You would have the same freedom. 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN I can feel that, that I can be with her and be with myself at the same time. 

00:40:15
LILIAN BORGES You can. Now or you could do that before? 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN No, I can, I'm gonna practice that now. 

00:40:25
LILIAN BORGES So let's, let's, I would like you to live with the image of how that looks like, okay. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:40:35
LILIAN BORGES For the, for the purpose of but also. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Maybe you're skipping. 

00:40:35
LILIAN BORGES What? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN I'm gonna remember you skipping here across the stage. 

00:40:40
LILIAN BORGES Oh, you remember that too, right. Yes. Right so you have that. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN But maybe I can skip with her. 

00:40:45
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN And stop feeling so bad. 

00:40:55
LILIAN BORGES Yes. And so how can I represent that and imagine that she's there? 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN But I'd have the skipping next to you. 

00:41:05
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN So it's two people skipping together. 

00:41:05
LILIAN BORGES Exactly. 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN Not that I'm carrying or that I'm being creeped that we are skipping together with my happiness can heal her rather than, you know, be a balancing. That will be wonderful. 

00:41:25
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Yes. So that what's you see as an image, you know, two little. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, two little girls skipping. Or big sister and a little sister skipping along. 

00:41:40
LILIAN BORGES Yeah, yes. Together. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:40
LILIAN BORGES When you think about that, what is the feeling that you have? Is there any heaviness, I think that's what I'm trying to, to ask you is there any heaviness? 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Well, there is a sadness that none of that existed but then there is the, I can be write history, you know, maybe I can and my other sister, knew that lots. So maybe that's an image that I can bring in now. 

00:42:10
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Now that I'm carrying but I'm skipping along with. 

00:42:15
[sil.] 

00:42:20
LILIAN BORGES Exactly. Yes. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN That's a lovely image. 

00:42:20
LILIAN BORGES It is a lovely image, yes. So now that you compare or look, right, how we were in the beginning to how you are right now, anything else? So what are you taking from the session today and is there any other piece that we need to bring uh… to working the next few minutes? Is to have time 15 minutes. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Well anchoring your, how you were here and then you know that the burden of wanting to throw up and in skipping are really three different images that I will always I'll remember. I'll be able to think of myself as those two and if this one little piece that I can go back to is that she's so much like my mother now sending double messages and I, and I that's part of that she. 

00:43:25
LILIAN BORGES She's triggering you. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN She's triggering me, you know in 2015 because she sounds like her and she looks like her and inadvertently she behaves like her. 

00:43:40
LILIAN BORGES Yes. So I'd like it to go back to put your hand right there. If that is okay with you. In getting, in contact in touch with that feeling in your body. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN You know, it's not there. 

00:43:55
LILIAN BORGES It's not there anymore. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:44:00
LILIAN BORGES What is, what is there now? Lightness, freedom. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Just a desire to, to move. 

00:44:10
LILIAN BORGES To move. We are done now. You are already done. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN I think we are done. It's not, it's not here anymore. 

00:44:20
LILIAN BORGES Not here anymore. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN No, it, she's, she's not my mother and she's not my child and I just need to remind myself. 

00:44:30
LILIAN BORGES Yeah, skip along with her. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Maybe I'll skip and I'll talk to her on the phone, she won't be able to see anyway. 

00:44:35
LILIAN BORGES That's good. That's awesome. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Just remind myself if I keep moving while I'm on the phone then. I'll keep me moving. 

00:44:45
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Yes. 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN That was wonderful. Thank you. 

00:44:45
LILIAN BORGES Thank you, thank you. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Thank you so much. 

00:44:50
LILIAN BORGES Thank you. 

00:44:55
[sil.] 

00:45:00
LILIAN BORGES You are very welcome. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN I appreciate that. 

00:45:05
LILIAN BORGES You are very welcome. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:45:10
LILIAN BORGES Do you have any questions or any comments? So please use the microphone, come here and use. I'd like, anyone is there a volunteer? Thank you. Could you bring that to her, thank you darling. 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Yes. Umm… it's, it's taller than me. I thank you for that. I was just wondering, understanding just energy states and energy. When you were doing this and taking it into your body, I'm wondering how to protect, how you protect yourself as therapist from all of these that you're bringing in to your body, the nausea, all of these feeling because there is a lot of that energy that's coming in, so. 

00:45:55
LILIAN BORGES You know, I have uh… people coming and asking me that and I, a part of me doesn't understand the question because I umm… I don't feel that is my energy. But I don't feel it's, right so it's me using my neurons and resonating with the person and as I'm doing that, I'm being, you know, using my empathy and so I will have some of the, the feelings then I can relate and I can tell her or him but then once I'm out there, I don't have it anymore. So it's really, I feel that is sliding off of me. I don't feel that I keep it really. Umm… umm… so that's I don't see any protection and to tell the truth, we are as therapist, we are doing that all the time. So uh… I think that the technique is different from any of, of the work that we do. We can do psychoanalysis, we can be talking to the people and still taking on things that are not right. So sometimes when I go home and I'm still thinking about patience, I have my own ways to try to release that. Uh… so I do prayers or I do right other things that will just release or I do supervision or things like that. I don't think this technique, I think people can relate to that when I say, okay, I take on and uh… that's more like a metaphor than anything. Because I think that what I'm trying to do is again using my mirror neurons to see to get in tune with you and as I do that I will feel well cured feeling as well as and because, because I am not her and I am taking that on and tuning in, I'm seeing from the outside. I have other information. Right so when I was there when she somehow was talking about it, I felt the sadness before she told me and somehow, I had this idea, oh that sadness is not hers. How do I get that information? I don't know. Partially, partially my trainings and trainings in family therapy and all, you know, I uh… I have that but umm… so when I do that, sometimes I, I feel umm… I have a lot of more information. So this is a different kind of empathy, right, it's experiential empathy and uh… what I like about this technique is that I can really put my you know put the person's shoes and see how it feels like and uh… it feels much closer and accelerates the process of therapy, so it goes so much faster, you know, we did here 45 minutes, 40 minutes and it was very uh… it was very fast and very, very deep. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. This pertinent or on what situations this pertinent to have the client do the sculpturing know where is that she would say this is how I feel and then would represent with her body either the problem and or the solution on the one that is shout skip for her. I think it would have been very empowering for her but I don't know, so that's my question. 

00:49:50
LILIAN BORGES Yes. Uh… I would ask her but I really didn't feel safe in here, for me or for her to do that, so I, I didn't want us to do this or fall or trip or anything. Umm… but it's a good question. So when I do the, the problem, one of my ideas is that, that we are externalizing the problem and doing so, it gets very memorable, right you said, we will never forget sometimes people say, I feel like a blob on the floor. So they see their therapist like a blob on the floor. That's very memorable. Right so you go out and that, that image goes with you and also all the metaphor and the suggestions that I give is okay, I'm taking this out of you, you don't have that anymore, we are clearing, we are cleansing that from you. So I think that is part of, of the process as well. Sometimes when I'm sculpting the solution or the resource, I ask the patient to, to look and then get into that state so they can incorporate. Right so this is disassociating from the problem and this is incorporating the resources, right. So I use uh… those two in a very experiential way, right. Any other questions or comment. 

00:51:15
[sil.] 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN I'm very interested that (inaudible ) grandson is here. 

00:51:25
LILIAN BORGES Yes. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN And uh… this was interesting to me, the last 16.5% seem to be confronting the inner (inaudible )that families can sometimes be like an (inaudible )of people and we have a delusion of, of reprieve just before they enter the concentration camp. Do you have any sense of that? That she's truly liberated from the camp, concentration camp experience of a family. 

00:52:00
LILIAN BORGES Umm… I think that sometimes families and relationships do that. Umm… and umm… we get into especially, when we are children, right, we go into a family system of a and then we just incorporate what they, what they expect from us and we are that and we don't have much of umm… uh… we don't have much of umm… our brain is not completely developed to say to analyze and be critical about everything that you are absorbing. Umm… but I think that a lot of some families are very help you to grow and you know and you have the, the safe attachment but a lot of times, the, the families are like very much like you know, a prison and there are so much suffering in that and one of my, my, one of my not only here in my office as well, one of my goals is that, that we can bring more and more of your essence, who you really are, what the part of you that I call your soul or the higher self and uh… clearing and letting go of all the things that limit you, limit that who you really are. So if that is a relationship, if that is a family uh… suffering or you know, history, uh… if that is what is limiting, let's clear that up, let's let it go, so you can you be more and more who you really are. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN It's true, they are freeing, liberates us all. 

00:53:50
[sil.] 

00:54:10
LILIAN BORGES Should we finish early, we have four more minutes. So what I'd like to do when I think that is makes it umm… seamless is because all those techniques are experiential, right using the, the either the role-playing or the sculpting or the, the hypnosis, they are all very experiential and my idea is that we live right and we learn and we change with life. Experiences that makes you different. While we could be sitting here and talking about things and changing your thoughts but I think that what really changes you is life and the experiences that you have in life so I'm very, very, I like very much using experiential techniques and I think it's really uh… I like having taking whatever is, is inside the person and let's look at outside, so we can have, we can have a peak, we can really experience how that looks like for me and for the other person in a different way. And we try to in hypnosis, we try to, this is my alarm saying that I'm talking too much. Uh… so in hypnosis after we externalize and feel and see how things, how the person experience things and try to umm… talk about it and what we could change then we could go inside in hypnosis and then we can let go or we can transform and we can bring the other parts, the higher self and have more healing. So I like bringing externalizing things, talking about it, uh… you know, making it more experiential, what is internally, what is different parts, the dynamics, umm… the feelings and then going inside and using the hypnosis to integrate all that. So that's a little bit of what we, we did here today. And really, I like bringing uh… every time that I bring a problem, I try to bring the solution. Right bringing the problem in the present moment because we can only change things when they are here present, in the present moment. So bring the problem in the present moment and then bring in the resources. For me a big resource is bringing the higher self, bringing the soul, bringing who you really are. That idea is very dear uh… to me and dear to my heart. Any questions or any comments? 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN You're fantastic. 

00:57:10
LILIAN BORGES Thank you.
