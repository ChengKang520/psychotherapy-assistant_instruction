RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. I'm Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker and once again welcoming you to uh, this Networker webcast on uh, our theme for this series is Men in Therapy. And we're very fortunate to have as our guest for this installment someone who has really been exploring this territory for the last 25 years or so, has written a couple of books on the subject, including "Men in Therapy." And uh, it's my great pleasure to welcome to this webcast David Wexler. David, how are you? 

00:00:45
DAVID WEXLER Good, how are you doing? 

00:00:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, let's have a manly talk here today. 

00:00:50
DAVID WEXLER Okay. We'll go bump chests. well, actually, you promised me that this was going to be like a Wayne's World episode. 

00:00:55
RICH SIMON Well, when what do you think? I'm delivering it so far, aren't I? 

00:01:00
DAVID WEXLER Well, you know, I think the, the decor of your office is a little different than uhm, than Wayne's basement but, but otherwise, you know, we can make it work. 

00:01:10
RICH SIMON That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me all day. 

00:01:15
DAVID WEXLER Good. 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON All right. So, David, so you uhm, your entrance into this arena, your really, understanding of what's distinctive about men and the inner world of men and an experience that uhm, really shaped your approach is your, your work with uh, on domestic violence. 

00:01:35
DAVID WEXLER Right. 

00:01:35
RICH SIMON Tell us a little bit about that and how you got started in really thinking about men as a treatment population. 

00:01:40
DAVID WEXLER You know, I had been in uhm, licensed as a psychologist for a few years, and what came my way was a proposal from the Navy here in San Diego, at 32nd Street Naval Station, to run some of their domestic violence groups. I put in a request for it, put together a team of people and uh, I don't know exactly how it worked, but somehow we got that contract and I got a crash course in uh, running domestic violence groups for men. And I was really expecting that the groups that I was running were going to have these guys who were really despicable characters, you know, or the clinical term for this is scumbags. 

00:02:15
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:02:20
DAVID WEXLER Uh, what, what I've, and there were a few percentage. And anybody who's worked in the field of domestic violence can attest to that, psychopaths, power and control freaks. But what I found was that a lot of the guys who we were treating really had issues that were very similar to what I could identify for myself, dealing with male issues and with relationship issues, parenting issues as well as a lot of the men that I knew personally and worked with. And through those groups, and that set up of men talking to other men, I really got uh, ushered into a whole different world about understanding male psychology in ways that, even though I was male myself and had dealt with all these things on my own, and as a psychologist, this was, this really opened up a lot of my understanding about this. And what I did then is started applying a lot of the ideas that were coming up in the group, things that I saw were working, to my more general work with guys individually or in couples or families that had nothing to do with domestic violence. But that launched a lot of my ideas about uh, how to really get through to sometimes difficult men. 

00:03:30
RICH SIMON Okay, so it's, what stands out about that as you're describing it, is because you were seeing men in a group context, instead of paying so much attention to the distinctive individual characteristics of these guys, you were seeing these themes that connected men. And the theme that really seems to have stood out for you, and you've written about this in a terrific piece that you did for the Networker back in 2010 in our article you called "Shame-o-phobia." So talk, describe what, what did you discover about the, this, the power of male shame and how it influenced relationships in a way that got people into domestic violence groups or just into, into trouble in their relationships generally? 

00:04:15
DAVID WEXLER Well, a couple of things coalesced for me because for one thing, I was doing these groups and hearing a lot of men's stories in ways that I had not heard in as much depth and intensity before. And I was also getting exposed to the field of uh, self-psychology and the self-psychology, one of the, the big themes is the notion of the self-object and particularly what's called the mirroring self-object which means that, that the response that uh, anybody, a man or a woman, gets from some key other either person or some area of their life serves as a kind of a mirror which reflects back a picture of them, of themselves and we're all, we're chronically exposed to things that we interpret as mirroring self-objects, either positive or negative. And that model just really clicked into place for understanding what men go through so much in terms of always feeling like something about their uh, I would call it manhood, but I think people might take that the wrong way. I don't mean just manhood like how much can you bench press or uh, or even how much money you're making or how many women you can sleep with or any classic indicators of manhood, in quotes. But also about uh, what kind of a father you are, what kind of, whether or not your wife or partner really values you. And I saw, I just could see how these men were so sensitized to any response that came from, certainly from their female wife or partner uh, that would either validate their sense of being valuable or self-worth, or in contrast, invalidate it. And part of what would go wrong in extreme, like in the domestic violence groups is they would feel this-, something would happen that would (inaudible ) that shame and they would respond really poorly It was a broken mirror, or what, you now, what you also might call a narcissistic injury or a shame experience that they didn't cope with very well. And as a result, what happens in shame is people either shut down, it's, it's like activating the sympathetic nervous system, you either shut down in flight or you attack the source of the person or the, or the event that has just made you feel really like crap. And, and that was, that became such an obvious sequence to me that triggered the vast majority of the domestic violence for the guys in our groups, uhm, that that model, you know, I took that model and ran with it, and used it with a lot of other men. 

00:07:00
RICH SIMON So stay with this for a minute. So, you know, women experience shame. Shame is a-, we don't have a monopoly on shame. So focus in on this for us. What is this uh, what's distinctive about this experience of male shame. What accounts for-, what is it? What account for its power? 

00:07:20
DAVID WEXLER Well, I think that uh, men are especially preoccupied, and you can even look at this from an evolutionary psychology point of view which accounts for, you know, some percentage of these things. We are programmed or trained to be successful, to produce, to protect, to, to do things that are uh, that, to not necessarily be powerful, although that's certainly part of being male. But to be, to take care of things. And so, when we get the message that we are not taking care of things properly, it pushes some very old, primal buttons. You combine that with the millions of cultural messages that men receive from early on, being boys. You know William Pollack talks about boy talk, and I, I use the, or I'm sorry, the boy code. And the same things applies, there's an adult version called a guy code, where boys get this message, you know, you're supposed to be successful. You're not supposed to have uh, show too much vulnerability. You're not supposed to be indecisive. You're supposed to know what to do. You're never supposed to act like something really shameful known as being a, a girl. That would, I mean that would, that, that's the worst things, one of the worst things you can call a boy on the playground is, you know, you're throwing like a girl. You're crying like a girl. Or the variations like, you're being a pussy. You're being, you know, you're being gay. I mean all of those are, are ways of saying you're not being a competent male. And we get those messages from media, from peers, sometimes and often from parents. In fact uhm, Donald Dutton, who's a big researcher in domestic violence at University of British Columbia, he did a lot of studies looking at the shame action in growing up with boys to their uh, uhm, to kind of behaviors they have as an adult growing up in the field of domestic violence. And what he found was boys who were shamed by their fathers more than the average level that boys feel sometimes shamed or rejected by their fathers, that was a direct predictor of uh, domestic violence as an adult. And part of-, then the shame-o-phobia notion really comes from a lot of that work. It's like, if, if you've had, experienced a lot of shame, which could be defined as getting put down, rejection, made to feel inadequate or stupid, uhm, directly or indirectly. If you've had a lot of that, and boys, the average boys have a fair amount and some boys have had a lot of amount that makes you hypersensitive to the possibility of feeling shamed again. It's like you're walking around with a bit of PTSD about shame. You're walking around anticipating the world is out to shame me. And I've got to be on the lookout for it. So for a guy, that might mean, you know, a guy who walks into a bar with that certain attitude like, what, you looking at me? What are you looking at? I mean, that's a guy who's, who's anticipating, there's some guy out there who's trying to mess with me and who's going to try to punk me in some way. And we know it happens to guys who walk into a bar like that. They end up getting into the fights because they're looking for it. And likewise (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
RICH SIMON But what-, go ahead. 

00:10:35
DAVID WEXLER One thought. And in terms of relationship, like in terms of intimate partner relationships, the men we're talking about are especially sensitive to any kind of criticism from their female partner. So what, what I, I hate to say a normal guy, but a guy who's handling this better, uh, what he might be able to handle in terms of his wife being unhappy with him or critical about something, a lot of guys hear that as, you are finding fault with my character, my value. And they misread, overreact, and create conflict in the relationship. But I'm not just talking about domestic violence, but just create distance, get sarcastic, etcetera. 

00:11:25
RICH SIMON So contrast this. So women feel shame. 

00:11:30
DAVID WEXLER Right. 

00:11:30
RICH SIMON What, what's the difference here between, why is this such a-, how is this a bigger deal for men if that's the case than for women? 

00:11:40
DAVID WEXLER Well, I think that women have, do plenty, have plenty of emotional suffering and certainly feel shame about, ways they could feel shame about their bodies. They can feel shame about uh, about maybe about uh, falling short as a mother. I mean there's a lot of different ways that women uh, do that. But what women are somewhat more vulnerable to, and this is uh, in some of the work that Steven Stosny and Pat Love have done, has been, has really uh, captured this. Women are more sensitive to anxiety about loss of connection and loss of relationship. And so, although, of course, they are capable of feeling shame about competence. And of course men are capable of feeling sensitivity about loss of connection or anxiety about that, it, there's just a-, the scales are tipped somewhat differently. And so, the, the preoccupation with, that you see in the male psyche and the male hero myth of going out into the world and being successful and doing what needs to be done, that's just-, it's not irrelevant for women. It's just not quite at the core of their archetypal identity. Right? The way it is for men. 

00:12:50
RICH SIMON Okay. So that's-, so you're saying so, with men then, it's sort of like our primary template for, our value in the world. 

00:13:00
DAVID WEXLER Right. 

00:13:00
RICH SIMON Has to do with this experience of uh, of succeeding, of being, uh, considered to be part of this tribe, this uh, the-. And then the experience of shame as I'm understanding it is that you're not good enough to be part of the tribe. You get excluded in, in the most primal way. You're not, you're disaffiliated from the group when (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
DAVID WEXLER Right. And that definition of good enough may vary depending upon your peer group or depending upon the kind of relationship you're in. You know, if you're a high school football player, you know, you may feel like if you can't uh, block somebody successfully enough and you let the team down, you may feel like you're incompetent. If you're married and have kids, you may feel like if you're not involved enough with your kids or they, they seem scared of you in some way, you may be failing at that. It's, the, the-, it all has to do with the appraisal of the situation. And you know, you know my, my purse story that I (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON Which I think you should share with, with uh, this audience at well. 

00:14:00
DAVID WEXLER Right. Okay, I'll tell, I'll tell another couple of people about my purse story. When uh, the purse story goes like this. I, my wife and I were in Europe a few years ago and uhm, we were in a plaza in Paris in a, in a park and uhm, she had a shopping bag and her purse and we were sitting on one bench which was in the sun and we wanted, she wanted to move to the shade. So she said to me, here, I'll take the shopping bag, just grab my purse and meet me over, you know, 50 feet away or whatever, across this little plaza. And I, absolutely froze. I could not pick up the purse. I could touch it. I couldn't actually grab it with my hand and take full possession of it. And I certainly couldn't walk across this plaza with this purse. And this was even in Paris, where, you know, people can get away with all sorts of stuff in Paris. 

00:14:50
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:14:50
DAVID WEXLER Uhm, and she looked at me in this way that women have at looking at, well, looking at me, I know. Maybe they look at other men like that too, like, you are, what is wrong with you? You are such an idiot. And she made a big show, of course, of grabbing the purse and hauling it over and in this dramatic fashion. And part of the background- 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Well, and you're ashamed, I'm sure. 

00:15:10
DAVID WEXLER Right. That's right. Well, I had my competing shames. First of all, I felt shame helping with the purse. Then I felt shamed about not being able to carry the purse and looking bad in her eyes. But the one background story to this is that uh, about a month or so earlier, just before we took this trip, I had back surgery. And so, part of the uh, which I was recovering from, you know, actually quite well. But part of the instruction was don't lift anything on this trip to Europe. So, throughout this trip, when we'd get on trains or in and out of cabs, or whatever, she did, was doing more of the heavy lifting. And I was, so in the background there, I was feeling a little emasculated, like I'm not, due to no fault of my own and no fault that, she wasn't trying to make me feel that way. But I attached this meaning, and we call that uh, the, appraising the situation as one that represents masculinity. So I was appraising the luggage situation as masculinity. And I was appraising the carrying the purse as a symbol of being not a real man in some way. And, and it was one more reminder to me that here, even me, Mister Male Expert and Male Psychology and written all the books and, and quite, you know, somebody who felt, feels quite confident about himself as a guy. After all these years, I couldn't carry the frigging purse. 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:16:35
DAVID WEXLER And uh, and this is the kind of stuff that men, one or another, are dealing with all day long depending upon the meaning that they attach to that event or situation. 

00:16:45
RICH SIMON Okay. So now, I want to get in a moment to uh, some of the, the uh, issues of handling these issues in the consulting room and, and how you've this uh, your understanding of shame and male psychology has changed you as a therapist. But, but, but one thing, it struck me when you wrote your article for the Networker and uhm, and I really-, that piece had a lot of impact on me personally both as a civilian and as a psychotherapist. Uh, one of the things that was really striking-, I hadn't heard much discussion in our field about that word, shame, such a powerful term. It's so primitive in some many ways. Now, am I missing something? Have there been some-? Did I not go to that class that day? I hadn't heard that discussion of this particular theme in particularly in men's lives in my own training and in the professional literature. 

00:17:50
DAVID WEXLER Well, it's, that's, the theme of shame has really been building for a number of years and there's a lot of people who are my sort of, you know, mentors or people who I've borrowed ideas from over the years from their research and their theory. I would say in the nineties is when a lot of people started, a lot of male, or researchers on male psychology really started focusing more on that theme. And it's, you know, I would say over the last 20 years it's been building. And a lot of the ideas that I, that I write about or talked about in that article for example, is a, is an integration of a lot of uh, you know, the different pieces that people have been focusing on. It's definitely not I, I didn't come up with the notion of male shame in 2010. I mean it's something that was that was building and I'm just putting my particular uh, spin on it. And the important thing, I, I have a feeling most of the people listening to this understand this, but I think it's important to clarify. The way that, that I use the terms guilt versus shame is that guilt is something you feel bad that you've done something wrong or you have remorse. And there, that is a very healthy uh, psychological or emotional experience to have. You know, God gave us the ability to feel kind of guilty so that we could correct ourselves and learn from our mistakes and, and be humble. Shame is something different. Shame is not, I made a mistake but I am a flawed person. I am defective. And one of the rules that I've learned to really live by, especially in my domestic violence groups and plus all the other work is that clinically, shame is not our friend. Shame is a, shame is our enemy. And the only, there's one exception to that, psychopaths. So if there's a psychopath, I figure, given him you know, a hypodermic needs with a little injection of shame, you know, and then he'll be like the rest of us. But outside of the rare, true psychopaths, in working with people clinically, and particularly with men clinically, when they get into shame mode, we lose them. They are not accessible to the kinds of, very kinds of things that we're hoping for, from or for them. And that they're hoping for themselves. They either freeze up and shut down because the shame is just unbearable, or another way of dealing with unbearable emotions is to lash out and get defensive and deny whatever it is that uh, might be a problem in their lives because the shame is too great. And so, with either of those reactions, clinically we're screwed. It's, it's not helping us at all to have uh, to have this guy enter the shame mode. 

00:20:35
RICH SIMON All right. So given this understanding that you've laid out for us, and this is sort of, this is uh, uh, the, the uh, in our issue of the magazine in which your article appeared we talked about the secret world of men. And I think for, for many people and many, many women, this connection between behavior and conflict in the relationship and the male experience of shame is not something they had thought about before. But let's, let's talk about as the therapist then, what is it, how do you uhm, once you begin to recognize the role of shame in so, all, not only in people with domestic violence, men with domestic violence but in people who are caught up in uh, conflicts in their relationship and all other kinds of issues that uh, trouble people and occasionally bring them to psychotherapy, though men less than women. What, how did you begin to change what you did as a psychotherapist in your office? 

00:21:35
DAVID WEXLER Well, another influence, clinically for me has been the work of Milton Erickson. Uh, I had pleasure of training some with him a couple years, uh, in the couple years before he died. And so some of the ideas that he developed have, I've integrated into some of this work with men. And one, one key concept is uh, that some people have studied about his work is the notion of pacing and leading. And that term has been used in different ways. It's used, it's a big term in neurolinguistic programming and some other uh, modes as well. But the pacing and leading that I'm talking about is you know Erickson was famous for being able to get around people's defensiveness rather than just busting it through head on, like with this the authoritarian hypnosis approach. He found ways to do it more indirectly and uh, use what's called the Naturalistic Approach. And so he would get people to accept new ideas or implement certain uhm, positive change without them, without necessarily having to go to war with them and bust through the defenses. And he, his style, which I don't even know if he talked about it, but people studying him were more articulate about some of these things than he was usually, was pacing and leading. And pacing and leading basically means if I've got some guy and I want to, I have a suggestion for him about a different way that he could understand his uh, his daughter's rejection of him, okay? So he's, he's sitting there in shame-o-phobia land, in broken mirror land and he, it seems like she's not interested in, in talking to him. He perceives that as a statement that he's failed as a, as a father. And the way he reacts to that is he withdraws from her or sometimes lashes out at her. And I'm trying to get him to help, to help him see it differently. That she is being a teenage girl who is into her own world. It doesn't mean what he thinks it means or even that there might be some ways that he could, that he could uh, more subtly reach out to her that might invite her in a little bit better. I want to tell him that. But I go for that right from the start once he tells me his story, he's going to get defensive. He's going to, what he's going to hear is you are failing. You don't have what it takes to be a guy. And he's going to react like, you don't understand, you know? She's so difficult and, and I try everything and it doesn't work and uh, you know, he'll have a typical defensive response. But if, instead, I engage in some pacing with him where I say I know, you remember what it was like when this girl was little and she, you, you were the greatest thing since sliced bread. She loved you. She, she followed you around the house to want to do everything Daddy did. You, you really care about her. You really love her. It's been hard for you to see some of the changes she's gone through and some of the ways that she's got, you know, more independent and and having that sort of teenage attitude. Uh, I know that it really stirs you up. I know that you're the kind of guy who really wants to really come through for your family. And it seems to me that given all those things, that, that it might help you if you could think a little differently about where she's coming from and why she's doing what she's doing. And then I would launch into whatever it is that my brilliant wisdom about how we can see things differently and therefore how he should handle a few things differently. And the reason that approach is much more likely to get through is because he's gotten this fundamental message. You're a good guy. You're a good father. I understand where you're coming from. Often I'll slip in some self-disclosure and I'll talk about my own experiences with that. So I get it. We're all in this together. I value you. I appreciate you. Oh, and by the way, uh, there's some better ways you can do this. And so, and, and that uh, approach with men, that's, that recognizes the shame-o-phobia factor. It means that if you, if you're conscious of how sensitive this guy is to the possibility of looking bad or feeling like he's really failing in some very important area, you've got to tend to that area. You have to make sure that there's no question in his mind that that's not what's happening here. That's not what's, what we're talking about. We're just talking about tweaking some things and improving on his performance in that area. And that's, I feel like those old principles, whether you call them pacing and leading or not. And whether I do it in the systematic fashion like that, that underlies a lot of the clinical work with men, is continuing to show that level of deep respect and appreciation. 

00:26:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So now, just-, as we'll move more into this area, but for the moment, so, how is that any different than a, than something that you might do with a mother who's having difficulty with her daughter? And you're trying to, and, and you're trying to make sure that you communicate to her, you see her as uh, a loving mother and a competent human being. How might that sound differently? How might you do anything different with that mother as opposed to that father? 

00:26:55
DAVID WEXLER Well, it, to a certain extent, it would probably sound quite similar. If I felt like this mother was really uh, worried about her own value or worth as a mother, then I, probably a lot of that pacing and leading would be very similar. What I think is more likely to be an issue with a mother and a daughter is the fear of losing connection with her. That the fear, the, the, the mother's feeling, not so much like she's being devalued as a mother, although she could be. I mean, she could be feeling that. But it's more like, I'm, I'm, I really thrive on us feeling close and connected and it really is sad for me to be losing that. And so the emphasis would be more on empathy with that component rather than the performance piece of this. And then, and then still going, the, the end result might be very similar. It might still be re-framing why her daughter's doing what she's doing, and how it's developmentally appropriate. And it doesn't mean that you're never going to feel connected to her. But it, it would, the emphasis is likely to be somewhat different. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:28:05
DAVID WEXLER And those, those two things, the performance versus the need for connection is usually one of the, the, that's the axis that sometimes delineates a response to a guy compared to a response to a woman. 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON And what you're picking up in the room is here's, here's where this person's at. This is how I can, what I need to (crosstalk). So now, one of the things that you emphasize in talking about your work and uh, uh, in your, in the Networker article you talked about something that changed a fair amount as you became more aware of these aspects of male psychology is the role that your self-disclosure as a man played in your work with men. Tell us something about that. 

00:28:50
DAVID WEXLER Well, there's another concept from self-psychology another self-object that's really important here which is called The Twinship or Kinship self-object. And what that, the theory behind that is that we're all driven to form, to feel like we are similar to or we're in the same club or clan as other people. We form bonds over being uhm, you know, being Iraqi war vets or being psychologists or being, you know, uh, San Diego Chargers fans or being, growing up with an alcoholic father or anything that people might, might share that forms a connection together. 

00:29:25
RICH SIMON A sense of kinship. 

00:29:30
DAVID WEXLER A sense of kinship, right. 

00:29:30
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) 

00:29:32
DAVID WEXLER Yeah, and so what happens for a lot of the uhm, men in treatment is that they often come in feeling with, in shame-o-phobia language, they, they feel vulnerable to the broken mirror. They feel like they're being identified as being messed up, as being a failure in ways that others are not failing. So the simple transaction, that's one of the reason why groups are particularly valuable for men. But in addition, the simple transaction of me, as a guy, in this therapist role saying, I know what you're talking about. I went, here's exactly what happened with me and my daughter one time where I just went, had a same type of uh, went through a same type of thing that you're going through. I know what it is. And I might, you know, tell the story. And I've got about, I've refined about a dozen different stories I have that I pull out of my toolbox for different situations. And these stories are, uh, they meet, for me they meet the litmus test of being meaningful enough and self-disclosing enough to touch the guy I'm talking to but they don't cross over the line into things that I don't tell anybody or things that would be, you know, really, you know, personally rather ashamed to have, to have this guy know or the rest of the world know. And I'm not telling you either. I'm not telling any of those stories right now either. But, for a lot of other stories, I've really found that it is very disarming in a good sense of the word, disarming defenses for this guy to hear. It's sort of like, a you too? You do that? Wow, you must, A, you must get me. And B, I guess it's kind of safe to talk about this in here. I don't have to put up a, a, the male front of looking good and looking confident because you've already told me about being incompetent yourself. Uh, and, and that really helps to uh, break the ice. The other thing that's valuable about that is that I often find that whether it's individual or group therapy or with the books I've written or uh, teaching workshops, the stories that I tell people, like my purse story, uh, they remember that way longer than they remember some of my, you know, brilliant interpretations or insights about, about something or, or a teaching about some researcher theory that I'm quoting. People really, people, we're storytellers and we like to, and we're story listeners. And people glom onto that and uh, it's sort of just kind of a touchstone for them about the works that they're doing. 

00:32:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So now, here's, you know so here's a, this is an area of practice where men, male therapists really have a, sounds like from what you're saying, have a real advantage in their work with men that women don't. So let me, let me get at this first of all with, what's the role of uhm, how's the-, what's the difference between the way you employ self-disclosure with your female clients in contrast to what you were just describing for us? 

00:32:40
DAVID WEXLER Uh, I certainly will self-disclose with female clients. It's just, it just doesn't seem quite as important. It, it, it doesn't, it doesn't seem to (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) as much. 

00:33:00
DAVID WEXLER Right. 

00:33:00
RICH SIMON Kinship bond at the same, they don't need that, your expression of kinship or you just can't get into that kinship experience in that way. 

00:33:10
DAVID WEXLER I mean there are some things, of course that transcend gender, like being a parent, you know? And there are times when I'm working with women and we're dealing with parenting issues and my parenting stories come in very handy for them. Uh, but some, some, the other grab bag of stories I have are not particularly relevant for their uh, their issues exactly. What women often like though is, they like stories-. When we're talking about their husband or their boyfriend, they like me telling my stories as a way of understanding, is that how guys think? 

00:33:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:40
DAVID WEXLER So, or, or, or sometimes it will normalize something that they're frustrated with or don't understand about the man in their life. I'll say, look, I'm not trying to defend the guy, but I know what it's like being a guy and here's what I think was happening for him because here's what, I can tell you about an example with me and my wife one time. And I'll launch into something and it will be clarifying for them. So, it's technically not self-disclosing to be above their experience. But it's helping them to understand the guy in their life. And it seems to come in handy in that role. 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON So now, when you're uhm, doing your workshops or doing supervision. You're working with women therapists who uh, for whatever reason are feeling challenged in their work with men. What is it that, so there's this kind of kinship experience. I love that, I like that concept of kinship in the, kinship in the therapy room. I think it really speaks to uh, to something that really does seem very important. Uh, that's not going to be so easily or readily or automatically available for the female therapist. So what are some of the, these issues when you're talking to female therapists about working with men given who they are and what things that they can easily uh, begin to, to work into their repertoire that you emphasize? 

00:35:00
DAVID WEXLER Yeah. Well I know that one of the other speakers in this series is Holly Sweet. And this is really an area that she has, has specialized in. I've learned a lot from talking with her and, and reading her materials. And I, when I, I have a whole, when we do training workshops for uhm, for therapists about working with men or about domestic violence, I have a whole piece about when women treat men. And I, I explain, I am, I want to make it clear, I am not a woman. So therefore, I don't know what I'm talking about. However, I've supervised a lot of women therapists. I've read Holly Sweet's books and other people like that. Uhm, my wife is a psychologist and I know she treats men. And we talk about, you know, some of those issues. I've been in therapy with a woman. So I approach it from a lot of different angles. But I don't, but personally, uh, it's all second-hand. But still, given all that, uh, one, there's a very good film clip that comes in handy for uh, training uh, women therapists working with men. It's from the movie "When a Man Loves a Woman" which was with uh, Andy Garcia and uhm, Meg Ryan maybe about ten years ago or so. Meg Ryan's an alcoholic and it's a story of their marriage basically. And there's a therapist scene, couple's therapy scene, in which there's a female therapist who, in many ways, mishandles the case, mishandles her, her interaction with the defensive guy in the room, who's played by Andy Garcia. And it's very valuable to take a look at that and see certain things that, that the woman just misses out on. Well, for one thing, it, it obviously took a lot for this guy in, in that character to walk into that room in the first place. It's actually the therapist and his wife had already, had been doing individual therapy for a while and they invited him in. And so the first thing that you've got to make sure and do and if your informed by shame-o-phobia, this comes easier, is to really recognize what a big deal it is for a guy to cross that threshold and go into enemy territory. Enemy territory could be just therapy in general, but it's really enemy, couple's therapy really can feel like enemy territory for a man whether it's, regardless if the therapist is male or female. It's like, you've got a woman in the room, his wife or girlfriend, who is this kind of alleged relationship expert because she reads all the self-help books and watches Oprah. And uh, a therapist who's trained in this. And the guy who's often in, a stranger in a strange land (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
RICH SIMON Doesn't know the rules of the game. 

00:37:40
DAVID WEXLER Right. And so to anticipate that and to try to put him at ease, what I like to do right off the bat is to say, I know how difficult it was for you to agree to come in here. And well here's, you know what it tells me? It tells me you really give a damn about this relationship and you're willing to put aside some of the things that, some of the anxiety you might have or apprehension you might have for a greater cause. I really respect that. Right off the bat I want you to know that. So that is really important to pitch that. And the more that any therapist, male or female, understands male psychology, that will just come naturally to make sure and tend to that. Then also, what you see in that film clip, is that there's a point at which he gets uhm, she says, the therapist says to him, uh, how are you feeling, which is always a loaded question to ask a guy because a lot of times guys are not able to quite articulate that. Uh, and they end up feeling stupid. But either way she asked him and he said, I'm feeling uhm, something like, I'm feeling frustrated or I'm irritated. And she says, why? And he says because I thought this was, this therapy was supposed to try to bring us closer and they've just been sort of bickering. And he says it and his voice kind of catches. And the therapist completely misses that. She says something like uh, oh and talking about your problems isn't making you feel closer? Like she sort of challenges him. That's the time to say to this guy, I am so glad to hear you say that. What you're telling me, is how much you really care about this relationship and how much this woman means to you. And that really is going to give us something to build on for the future. It's like what you, as a therapist, what you want to do is you want to catch this guy doing something right. And so he might be in somewhat defended male mode, or more like intellectualizing male mode in autotouch with feelings and at least autotouch with the kind of feelings that we as therapists like to have expressed. But whenever he, he branches into that kind of territory, whenever he, there's a little bit of you know, emotion in his face, or you can hear it in his voice or see it in his eyes or there's some words, you want to really reward the hell out of him. That is a big deal for him. And the problem for a lot of men is not that they are cold or uncaring, although, I mean, some might be, but for the vast majority, they're not cold and uncaring. They're just feeling incompetent at the rules of engagement and what is, what's involved with really connecting in the way that their female partner or sometimes with their kids need them to do it. And if you give them some, if they start to do something right and they realize that or if you give them some tools to make that better, they'll very quickly grab on to that because they want to be successful with that. One of the reframes that I often do in couples therapy is when a guy is kind of freezing up and responding to his wife or partner, I'll say to him, you really want to feel connected to your wife right now but you just don't know the right words. And that reframe is really important because instead of saying to him, instead of communicating to him, you don't care. You're cold. You don't know how to love somebody. That's his fear. Instead of saying, no we just have a technical problem here. Your heart's in the right place it's just that there's a certain, there's a little (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON (inaudible)technical difficulties. 

00:41:25
DAVID WEXLER And that message is a much actually for the female partner, because I want her to recognize what she's dealing with. She's not necessarily dealing with somebody who doesn't love her or is incapable of that, but who needs some education uh, because of these technical difficulties. 

00:41:45
RICH SIMON So, so, you know, and clearly you're, when we get into these issues of gender differences, we speak in generalizations and there's always exceptions and you're always at pains to emphasize that. So as, as you look at the spectrum of the male clients you see and you think of this issue of, that you alluded to a moment ago about uh, this uh, expression of emotion, but for some schools of therapy, some therapists that's the lode star, to get people to express their emotions. Now, what we're, often it seems to me that what people uhm, talk about when they talk about men is adapting therapy in a more coaching style. It's action oriented, talk your guy talk. You don't expect guys to move into this uh, kind of emotion laden territory. Now, are there exceptions to that in your practice? Are there uhm, are there certain kinds of guys who come to see you in couples or perhaps individual therapy where it becomes more of an emotional journey. And if so, who are these, those kinds of clients? 

00:42:55
DAVID WEXLER Uhm, it's definitely true that there are some men who don't really have the kind of profile that we're talking about today. In other words, they uh, they come in voluntarily. They realize that there's inner issues that they have that they're trying to work on. They're able to articulate that reasonably well. They're able to express emotions, etcetera, etcetera. Uhm, so that exists. I'm not quite sure who that guy is other than I know it when I see it. I mean, I don't, I don't know if there's a certain category you know, it's not based on uhm, age really or ethnicity or any, any specific you know, demographic. 

00:43:35
RICH SIMON You know it when you see it in, in your office. 

00:43:40
DAVID WEXLER Right. 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:43:40
DAVID WEXLER And, and with that guy, I know I can uhm, I still want to relate to him, you know, keeping it in mind that this is guy and he has a particular set of guy issues. But it's less of an issue in the room. I'm more just being a therapist with a person over there uhm, that is, what I don't have to think as careful about how he's going to filter this in a particular uh, guy uh, guy filter. And you know how it is with generalizations. This whole series is about men in therapy as if men are this monolithic group. Uh, and obviously we come in all shapes and sizes and uh, personality types and sexual orientations and everything else. Uhm, but still there's a, the reason that there is such a thing as male psychology and that we're having this conversation in the first place, is that there's enough of a, of these, of these factors that seem to cluster together in general for a lot of men that it makes it worth our while to pay attention to those issues. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. So, so, do you, how explicitly and, and, and if so, when might you talk about, would you ever use this, the word shame and try to talk about at that level. So far we have, you've been describing a number of ways of making people comfortable in therapy, men particularly or a certain kind of man comfortable in therapy. Shame for most of us is not a word that immediately makes us comfortable. So what role does the direct discussion of this dynamic of shame play in the work, kind of work you do? 

00:45:20
DAVID WEXLER It's pretty rare that I use the word shame in dealing with a man. I'll often use the word shame if I'm talking to a woman about what her husband is experiencing, so we're talking about somebody else there. But, but just I think you've nailed it that a lot of guys, hearing the word shame, hearing the word shame is shaming. 

00:45:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:45:35
DAVID WEXLER So just, it would cause them to freeze up. And everything we're talking about here today is simply based, it's not because it's so morally correct to do it this way. It simply works better. It's more pragmatic. And so if we know that using a certain word tends to have men retreat and freeze, we don't want to use it. If have other language or other ways of getting through that seems to relax them or open them up in some way, then we want to use more of it. It's just a, you know, a little learning theory feedback here. Uhm, but using the word shame directly, I mean, once in a while it seems to fit. A guys able to hear that. But most I'll talk. I'll operationalize it. I'll say you must, you feel like you're just, you know, you're not coming through. You feel, you feel like people are looking at you and thinking that, that you're uh, that you're failing in some way or that, or that you're not living up to the expectations that your wife or your kids or other people have of you. So we're trying to operationalize shame. And that is true with a lot of, a lot of male language. We, like there's a lot of guys when we talk, when I describe the work that we're doing, if I use the word therapy, for some guys that's okay. They say, okay, I'm in therapy. For others, you know, it's not therapy. I've got to call it counseling. For other guys, even counseling sounds like, it suggests that they are deficient in some way and need to be counseled. So I call, I've got to call it coaching. And I've got, there's one couple I see who I've been seeing them pretty regularly for uh, several years. And he describes this as his marital tune-up. And so, to me it seems like if, if you're coming in to marital therapy fairly regularly for a few years, we're talking more of an overall than a, than a tune-up. But for him, it allows him, calling it that allows him to sit in that room, work damn hard on his feelings and his issues and the bumps in the road that come in with this relationship, and still, and not have it seem uh, shameful. I mean, that's where it's at. So marital tune-up is a nice, for him, it's a it's a term that can work. 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON You're sort of a clinical grease monkey in other words. That's good. 

00:47:55
DAVID WEXLER I, I, I've been called a lot of things. 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON Do you have a sign on your desk, David Wexler, Clinical Grease Monkey? 

00:48:00
DAVID WEXLER Yes. I see a new future there. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON You pull this out for certain male clients. 

00:48:05
DAVID WEXLER Right. 

00:48:05
RICH SIMON So, so let's, let's get at this at a slightly different way and, and kind of pull back for a moment here and, and kind of grasp the process. So we've been talking a lot about guys coming in, an initial defensiveness the culture of psychotherapy as, as you and many others have pointed out as much as we're becoming more and more aware is a, is a, uh, is a feminized culture in certain respects. And there's kind of a, a certain gender, it's the one arena in our culture where perhaps there's a certain gender bias in the, in the uh, against the patriarchal uhm, norm. But, let's talk about, when you've done good work with somebody, so we've described again and again, you've done such a nice job with this, describing guys as they come in. As they're leaving the process, whether it's individual work or perhaps it's couples therapy. I don't know if you still do your groups in addition to your domestic violence groups. What's, what do you see? What's changed? Without it sounding too Utopian, what is it that you tend to see when the guys who you feel have really benefitted from the, the experience of coming to see you, whatever mode of therapy you've uh, been involved in with you? 

00:49:25
DAVID WEXLER Uh, well I can tell you one thing that we noticed from the domestic violence groups. When we do exit interviews with those groups, and you know, the standard exit interview question is what did you most uh, what will you most remember from this group? Or what do you think was helpful, uh, most helpful? One of the things that they say, and I think I, if, I think this would be echoed in my individual work as well is, I learned to tell a different story. You know? And you know, the language that we have for that in our field is self-talk, narrative, cognitions, uh, the uh, a way of uh, I guess, narrative is probably the word that, that I'm most comfortable with. It's like they, they say, I used to, everything that I used to think, or every event that used to happen to me, I would think about it in terms of my manhood is on the line, or this is some statement about me. And I've really learned that when, to stop for a minute when something comes my way and think about what's really happening here? How is, why is this other person acting the way that he or she is? Is there some reason I can try to understand or relate to and make sense out of it that doesn't necessarily have to be interpreted as some sort of threat or danger to me? That is one of the most powerful changes that I see uhm, that I see men utilizing. And as we know, that when you alter your story, the feelings and behaviors follow. Because uh, the, you know, it, it, I could certainly say that one sign of success or one change is that guys have a, have more access to their inner world and are able to identify uh, a broader range of emotions that we teach them what, you know, we call the emotional vocabulary and identifying inner states better. And of course, we're, there's a lot of teaching of better skills and, you know, different ways of communicating, handling stress, etcetera. But in my experience, the most, the key lever, the key point on the chain is changing the story because if you're stuck in a story that says what my wife is saying to me right now is a threat and has to be defended, then that launches the train on a track that is very difficult to get off of. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:51:55
DAVID WEXLER So, so, to me that, knowing that a guy really sees himself differently and is able to interpret the behaviors of the key others in his life in some newer and creative ways that, that I think are more accurate, that to me is, that's golden. When I hear it and I, and I have confidence in his future. 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON So, say a little bit more because that's, that gives us a sense of what, what the story no longer is, how the story has, what uh, what the guy is realizing is a limited story. But, can you give me some sense of kind of what is the new story then? So it's, I'm getting what it's, it's not about. Everything is not about my manhood. Everything is not about some test. Every time my wife says something and she's unhappy about our relationship or she uhm, expresses some anger at me doesn't necessarily mean there's something dreadfully wrong with me. So is there another, what are some of the other kinds of typical storylines, perhaps that guys develop that may not be the Utopian uh, therapeutic uh, epiphany but that really seem help the guys that you see move on in their lives and experience more satisfaction in their relationship. 

00:53:10
DAVID WEXLER Okay. Here's one story that uh, that I use. It's actually not my story. It's a story of a friend of mine. The husband and wife have a 13 year old daughter and they love to out, they love to take long hiking trips together. And the woman, the mother, is all, she's pretty ambitious and you know, physically active and wants to do this. There are certain times on every one of these hiking trips where she has, gets like an anxiety attack and she's very prone to anxiety, like crossing a, a small stream, even. Not a dangerous one but just where there may be some rocks where she might slip. She knows it's irrational. She knows it, it, it doesn't really, it's not real, there's not real danger but people with anxiety have irrational reactions to things. Uh, so often they have to slow down or take some different path because of some of her anxiety. Or even, or there's times when it just might take her longer to do some, to walk on some narrow path or something. The guy, the husband in this case, in this family. Uhm, he used to get really irritated with her. And he would, you know, treat her like, you know, what's wrong with you? You're acting like a baby. You're slowing us down. And that would really, that would get transmitted of course to the daughter who started to devalue her mom. Dad's strong. Mom is weak, or whatever. And instead what, what the guy started figuring out is how destructive that was. And what he was able to tell himself and more importantly, tell his wife and his daughter is, this is the quote that he said to his daughter, "I realize your mom is so brave. She faces things that are really difficult and challenging for her and she does them anyway. Your mom is one of the bravest people that I know." And I love that story. I mean, I used to, you know, Terry Real, who I know you're going to be interviewing also, he has this term relational heroism where people really, they come to a fork in the road and they could either go, they could say something nasty or they could find some way to be pro-relationship and they choose the right course. That's a, that's an act of heroism. This guy in that family with his wife struggling across the stream, if he says that to his daughter, he's a hero. And what it requires is he really had to tell himself a different story. He had to be able to say it's not just that God, I got stuck married to somebody who's dragging me down in life. But I'm so grateful that I'm with somebody who demonstrates such courage in the face of a lot of internal adversity. And I'm lucky for that. And so, and I got a thousand examples of, of those guys. But that's, that's a narrative example that I think (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON That's great. That's great. Yeah. And that's, and maybe that's a great place for us to stop on a note of relational heroism. Uh, uhm, so, uhm, let's see. Uhm, I, want to just point out to, to people as I do repeatedly, uh, in these series that our conversation is the beginning. The real important conversation is what continues after this session. One way to make sure that you uh, those of you who are listening to this get your thoughts focused and it to take a moment and you'll see on your screen a comment board, uh, which is there for uh, several purposes. But one is just, put it down. It's your (inaudible ) to remember. What stood out for you about uhm, our conversation today. Uh, what connected the dots. What it reminded you of in your own work and your own life. If you have some questions that you would like to address to David, he has graciously agreed to look at our comment board no guarantees that he'll respond in encyclopedic fashion to any of these questions. But he will look at them and there's a possibility he will comment on them. And also, other people who are taking this webcast will get the benefit of your thoughts and reactions. David, before we, we go and say goodbye to you for the afternoon, if people want to follow up with you about trainings, publications, how, where do they go? How do they find out more about your work? 

00:57:30
DAVID WEXLER Well, we have a nonprofit institute in San Diego called the Relationship Training Institute. And out of that institute we do a lot of different training programs on domestic violence, on men's issues and a lot of other relationship oriented issues. We also take those trainings on the road. I, I do teachings all over the world about some of these different uh, different models. And anybody who wants to get either in touch with me or our staff or find out about the programs, can go to the website which is RTI, that stands for Relationship Training Institute, RTIprojects.org. So R-T-I-p-r-o-j-e-c-t-s. org. And the other thing is uh, I've written five books. Uh, one book on adolescent treatment from the adolescent self. A book on, called "The Stop Manual" on domestic violence. Uh, a book called "When Good Men Behave Badly." Uh, "Is He Depressed or What?" And a book a couple of years ago for Norton on Men in Therapy. So, many of the ideas that we've been talking about here today you could find a lot more detail through those books or through attending some of the training. 

00:58:35
RICH SIMON All right. And, and in addition to writing a terrific cover piece for us in the uh, May, 2010 issue and I think on the fulfillment page of uh, for this course. There's a link to that. And also you can go to the Networker website to read David's piece on shame-o-phobia. David, what a pleasure. Uh, I just really appreciate the clarity and uh, the uhm, the practicality of what you've offered us here today. So, thank you for that, and uh, 

00:59:10
DAVID WEXLER Well, Wayne, I thank you very much for the opportunity to join you in your garage down here. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON There we go. So here it is from Wayne's World. He's, it's one man seeing through another, through the very veneer of pseudo professionalism he sees my inner Wayne. Uh, and I'm sure those of you with clinical intuition have seen the same thing. So for now, good bye from Wayne's World and from the Networker Central. Uh, and again thank you, David for a really enlightening conversation. Good bye. 

00:59:40
DAVID WEXLER Thank you.
