Diving Deep and Resurfacing: Feminist therapy with African American women struggling with depression with Vanessa Jackson, LCSW 

00:00:00
"If we choose, however, to honor the descent as sacred and as a necessary aspect of the quest to fully know ourselves, fewer women would lose their way in depression, alcohol, abusive relationships, or drugs. They could experience their feelings without shame, reveal their plan without apathy." Maureen Murdock, The Heroine's Journey 

00:00:00
Vanessa Jackson, LCSW 

00:00:00
Feminist Therapy involved explicit discussions of societal values which constrict women's power. 

00:00:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW It's a political thing for me. I . . . So much of my work is informed, uh, by my, my role as a black feminist activist, and what that means for me is that I am always (ph)attuned to racial implications and, and one's life and one's positioning as an African-American person, an African-American woman, so I'm looking at intersection of gender and race and class and just the political status of women in our society, and that there are constrictions on our sense of power, there are absolute limitations on our earning potential, and uh, being impoverished in the . . . And w-, (ph)we talk about the feminization of poverty . . . These are all things that deeply impact women's emotional well-being and African-American women's m-, well-being. Added to that is historical context (ph)shamee and one of the things I've is to re-, research on African-American psychiatric history, and I remember reading about Dorothea Dix and, and other sort of early activists, a-, advocates, mental health advocates who had a sense that, that black peoples didn't have sufficient, uh, sort of humanity to experience melancholy, so in fact we didn't, we weren't capable of depression because it was say, like saying Bossy the Cow was depressed, and so there's this really weird sort of thing that we have to struggle with as black women is, one is are you (ph)for (ph)our (ph)right to be depressed, and then also not getting overly attached to the label and understanding that someday it's just really hard to distinguish between my oppression and my depression and the fact that I have to work with those simultaneously, so for me the political stuff is looking at what is your external environment and how is it either supporting your sense of living as a free, uh, actualizing person and what are the constrictions on that that, that gap between what I believe to be possible for myself and my capacity to achieve that is in fact very depressing and oppressing. My, my, my perspective on labeling . . . First of all, it's a political, uh, explanation, is that one is because there is typically s-, uh, such mis-diagnosis but also the fact that not getting people over-identified with, uh, a label and then living out the label, and in my sense of it it's also about finding, um . . . Especially depression. I've had people come in and say and almost argue with me a little bit and I said, "There's no need to argue. I believe you," but one woman said, "I don't think I'm depressed." She goes . . . I, I said, "Then can we call it a really deep sadness?", and for her that was okay. Someone came in recently and said, "I have a heaviness." There . . . For these women - cuz often times I work with very political women - that sense of having something outside of themselves define who they are is very problematic, and so I don't want to spend a lot of time in therapy helping them adjust to the label often times because there are things outside of their lives that are impacting their reaction too and if I get them attached to the diagnosis that it's just a biological experience that we miss the things that are happening in their lives that are in fact creating or maintaining this state of deep sadness, this heaviness, and . . . But I think mostly because it gives people an opportunity to feel like "I got some control. I have (ph)deed understand this and if I understand it then I have a possibility of shifting things in my life, uh, in ways that I can be liberated from this deep sadness." You know, one of the things about this work . . . Well, my work in this area has been specifically focusing on African-American women the ideas and practices are widely applicable in the sense especially for people who have been disconnected from their feelings and have not had places to tell their stories, uh, and so that can also be very much, uh, appropriate for male clients and also labeling so that people don't have to be involved in labeling themselves in a certain way, and so what I've found is what, well, this was sort of (ph)norm'd on African-American women is widely applicable and uh, in fact, one of the things that I have uh, a woman that is a European-American woman and every once in a while she says, "Can I have some of that black girl therapy?", and because it's the sense of like if we can tell the story and I allow you to tell your story and define your strengths I can't think of a person that can't u-, um, utilize that kind of experience, and so if I find something works for, for black women, it's sort of like we lift the boat that it then can be something that would be a-, widely applicable for people so . . . 

00:05:10
The Descent 

00:05:15
[sil.] 

00:05:15
I invite clients to explore the idea of descent which involves an exploration of internal and external constrictions which result in profound sadness, hopelessness, and emotional numbness. 

00:05:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Yeah, the, the one, the language has made the most sense for me and, and again, comes out of both a personal experience and twenty-some, 25 years of working with, uh, mostly African-American (ph)air women, (ph)African-Amer women, and so I heard, uh, Maureen Murdock, uh, has a book that's called The Heroine's Journey and I love story-telling anyway, and this was before I even discovered narrative therapy, but she was writing about women's, uh, struggles and, and she had a piece where she talked about if women could see their depression as more of a descent. It's sort of like in a mythic journey that you go through trials and tribulations; you descend in, you find the golden ring, you bring it back to the tribe, then you have it gives meaning to the struggle and that you understand that there's a process that's happening, there's a process of being in a place, descending. Everything gets chaotic, everything changes, you don't know who you are anymore. You've, you s-, you sort of have some suffering, you find allies, you find challengers, but you find something in that process for you that transform you, transforms you, and then you can bring it back to your community and that other people can benefit from and so when I read it I thought, "Oh that's such a much more helpful way of looking at this really, sort of, soul-killing, spirit-breaking, um, emotionally- confusing experience.", and so, for me, from that point on I felt I like this idea of descent and so one of the things that I, I did was that I was in a, a workshop with three other women and we talked about depression, uh, from three different lenses from across, you know, actually from ages, so a very young woman that was in her 20s, I was in sort of 30s, and someone else was in her 40s, and across roles, and so we're looking at a student-daughter, uh, a professional, mental health professional specifically, and someone who was, uh, a mother, and so as we start to have these conversations between, uh, uh, in preparation for this conference . . . It was called, um, Black Women Raging, Healing, and Re-claiming Power, is that we start to tell these stories to each other and one of things we found out with that was that it was important how we named it, how we approached it, and that one person talked about really having to resist the labels that were being put on her as a young ch-, as a teenager because she felt like it wasn't looking at the things that she was experiencing in her life, and so it was missing big chunks, and, and here she was so able to resist it to say "There's a piece you're not getting. The piece you're not getting and if I comply with this label that you're giving me then you're never gonna go look for these other pieces.", and somehow, this 15-year-old child knew how to do that, and, and the woman that was talking as a mother was saying, you know, "Getting up everyday with no energy, really wanting to die, and having this little person that I don't have a right to take him out and I don't have a right to abandon him . . .", but just the weight of, um, her life, and so while she would say that, you know, "I'm not opposed to the label des-, of depression, I wanted people to get understand that there was the pressures of being a single Mom and, and trying to have a life and trying to, you know, imagine a future for my child. Um, that was overwhelming. That was absolutely overwhelming.", and so everybody found their own language but all . . . What seemed to be a consistent theme for these women and all the women that I've talked to was the desire to have their life understood, whatever label was put on it, a-, and, and always a concern about people stopping too soon and not hearing the rest of their story, and so some of the labeling issue, for me, again, is it's partly political but it's also a fact that we can miss very important chunks of one's story but also miss really important opportunities, sort of, what I call "footholds of hope" and "footholds of meaning" for people to pull themselves up out of it if I don't know and don't allow you to tell me how this depression came in to your life. When did it first show up? What does it feed on? And what seems to make it wanna go away? I, I think that's really important, is always to asking people and, and when, when I ask them, "Well, what's been going on in life?", what's affected them, I also got really clear about the need to talk about what's happening internally for them, how are they feeling, how are they talking to themselves, um, sort of, what are the other things happening in their lives, uh, and then I can allow for some sort f biological vulnerability, so those are some of the internal things. The, the external things that are really important that I know some people don't immediately go to are life experiences, and so I, I wanna draw some attention to what's happening outside and I tend to go from an outside-in perspective. It's like I deci- . . . I don't decide that there's something going on with this person's brain or something internal to them until I look at, invite them to look at what are external things that you're reacting to. What are some possibilities that could lead to this, and one of the things that I find very interesting is I, um, sort of have a woman that's uh, sort of corporate and she's having all this stress and all this low self-esteem and other sort of symptoms of what we might think of as depression and I said, "Tell me about . . .." I said, "Do you think anything has to, any of this has to do with the fact that you are one of the few African- American women in this environment, largely white male, um, marginalizing you all day, and I think we need to call racism as one of the externals that are, is definitely impacting how you're experiencing your self, how you're experiencing work, and it's contributing to this descent experience (ph)and (ph)they . . ." . . . (ph)Again, it was one of those light bulb moments. It's like it's not about . . . And she . . . "Well I don't wanna play the race card." It's like, it's not about the race card, but you have to accurately assess what's happening. You can still stand your power on that but you're not gonna be well if you don't acknowledge the fact there are external things that are daily happening to you that are profoundly impacting both your capacity to perform your job but also your fundamental sense of your self. So we gotta . . . We always have to go back and forth and look and it's not my job to name them as a therapist but it is in my in-, um, responsibility to invite some questioning and some searching around that. 

00:11:45
Hopes and Dreams 

00:11:50
[sil.] 

00:11:50
Reconnecting with Hopes and Dreams helps to identify and clear blocks to a clients sense of power and agency. 

00:11:50
I invite women to create a vision of a healed life within the first few sessions and this will serve as the core treatment goals. 

00:12:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (ph)Yeah, I think hopes, hopes and dreams, for me, are really central because they . . . I, I, I talk about sort of this, this Batman, old-school Batman's grappling hook that he shoots out and then climbs and then climbs up the wall with Robin behind him, uh, but I think those are things about w-, what I can believe is possible because where people are right now when they're in descent is a really hard place. It's a very scary place so very quickly I'm trying to get people to think about what a future without this descent, without this heaviness, would look like for them, and so inviting them to, to imagine a different life, which is no . . . It's not easy and people often times will look at me and think, "Are you kidding me?", but the, and thing of it is is say imagine what it was before the depression came in to your life or what it could be like. I want to be able to hold your hope and for us to create space to hold your hope and give you little- (ph)bitty footholds like a rock climber that you can move toward. Um, and so one of things I do is, actually, I use a lot of flip charting, what I, one of my clients labeled flip charting. I have a flip chart with markers in my room office and I ask people sort of "Tell me.", like, "Let's just guess. It's okay to guess at what could be hopeful but you've gotta have a goal and it could be a little-bitty goal or it could be a big, grand goal but you've gotta have something that allows you to get up and push through this feeling and, um, and so if we could get, uh, a g-, a h-, uh, a goal then we can talk about the willpower, like how passionate you are about that and, a-, and, and so this, i-, it has enough energy to propel you, literally sometimes, out of bed, uh, to start to move toward it but also the sense of the waypower like CJ Snyder's concept of, of goals, uh, of hope as, uh, the willpower and waypower toward a specific goal, uh, because it says now I got . . . A lot of people (ph)didn't have the willpower like, "I want, I want to make it happen. I, I duly see this as possible for me, whether it's about I've (ph)didend, disconnected from my creativity, um, I . . . There's a dream I want that has been blocked for me and I've, and I'm just dying almost because I don't see that it's possible and I'm giving up hope.", um, but also the waypower is that, "I know how to get there. I know someone that can help me get there.", and I think often times it's helping people to understand you've got, you have the goal and they haven't made progress toward it but they have that passion. "I, I really want it. I think I can have it. I, I deserve it." Have no clue about how they get there and it's been interesting to sort of be able to discern that and I, I was working with young woman and she was talking about what she wanted but, uh, a-, and but she just had no energy. She just . . . Her energy was drained and I, I got . . . Somehow I . . . The . . . It popped in my head almost like a spinning wheel when you're stuck in a rut with your car and I remember calling her up and said, "You know, it occurred to me. I know that you want this thing really badly and, and, and the not, the disconnection from it has made you very sad." I said, "Do you have any idea how to get there?", and she said, "Absolutely not." I said, "Okay, we'll work on that. We'll work on that and, and that's one of those that also, um, where what is beyond the therapy and, well, who do I need to bring in to help her figure this thing out or, and where do I connect her outside of therapy. I was talking to a wom-, young woman once and we were talking about financial stuff and her depression and she's also been in an abusive relationship and so I'm, I'm sort of trying to sort of spread out and say, "Let's look. You're sad. I get that.", and, "We need to address this but we need to sort of widen this lens because you're being disappointed and being battered in a relationship. The, the financial consequences of being injured and losing your employment, uh, are, are things that we have to take into consideration and with those things changed you might feel differently. The other piece of it is looking at this larger stuff of being a single black woman with two children in a world that doesn't value that and, and, and sort of sends out the story that you're somehow responsible for your suffering and we need to look at what is the individual responsibility and what our larger, societal, sort of, experience is and expectations and say, "It's okay to pay someone a non- living wage.", and watching this woman's eyes like the light bulb went off for her like, "Oh! It's not just my failing.", and so for her, having that opportunity to see there was something bigger impacting her life. You know, the, the political is very personal and the personal is political and being able to help understand that the larger political things are happening that have an impact on your functioning and therefore on your emotional well-being and helping people to see that and then once you know that you still have to do something about it, but you're doing it from a position not of "I am personally failing" but then, "You know, there's a lot of people in my situation.", and, "What can we do collectively to shift this?", but also just knowing there is a incredible power and just knowing that I am reacting to something to. I just don't have bad biochemistry. I'm reacting to something and trauma changes brain chemistry too, so . . . (ph)I . . . (ph)This (ph)pink . . . Giving some (ph)my a tool to look more completely at their life experience and then looking at places where I can make some changes. 

00:17:10

00:17:10
Resources and Community. 

00:17:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW One of the things that's really important for me, and what I've found important in my work with African-American women, but I think really for anybody is that therapy is sort of, for me, a, um, a very controlled environment. It's a laboratory for change. My biggest, um, work is to get people to take that, the lessons of therapy, out into the wider world for them, but also to bring in resources, um, in their everyday lives, and so that can be everything from classes to activism to their spiritual, uh, values. One of the things that's really important for me is that if people have a spiritual tradition, regardless of their spiritual tradition, if it's something that has supported them I invite . . . Bring it into the room. So I ask 'em a intake form if they have a spiritual tradition and if it is helpful. I ask them what it means for them, how they think that can be utilized in this particular healing modality. Talking someone recently who had experienced a loss and I, so I said, it's like, "Well let me just check. There's going to be some sadness and grief. Help, help me understand. Does your spiritual tradition allow for relationships to continue after people have died?" Okay, if that's true . . . Now if the answer's no there I gotta go into something else. If the answer is yes, then we can start talking about how you begin to nurture that relationship and get closure or have continued connection that helps. It doesn't take away the grief, but it helps you understand and hold and continue to take lessons from that relationship, and it's always kind of interesting when people, when I invite those kind of questions often times, and it's rare that someone says that they don't have their tradition doesn't allow for that, and so whether they call it prayer, they, you know . . . Some (ph)intermediary god or whatever but there's a on-going relationship and I can see the kind of relief like, "Oh. It's okay to talk about that," and it's like absolutely okay to talk about that. Also, being able to ask people is there anything in their spiritual traditions that are complicating what's happening. So if someone has in fact has come in and their dealing with some guilt or grief around a terminated pregnancy, I need to know if that has somehow affected their relationship with their concept of a higher power and what we then do to rebuild that relationship and, and so I'm always looking at what do you have around you, the people that you have around you. "Who are you, who are your friends?" "Who . . ." "Where do you feel connected?" is a question that I ask quite frequently because if someone says nowhere then that means we gonna have to get, like, boots on the ground really fast to get somebody connected somewhere because it also indicates the level of sort of sadness and disconnection which can be very life-threatening if someone has no anchors, and so, to say, "Okay, how do . . . How do you get that then?", and then remind people yes, it's very hard when you're feeling very low-energy to go out and begin make new connections, so let's talk about the ones that are gonna be easy, so whether that's a social connection, a work connection, and how do we practice then making those connections, cuz often times someone will say, "Well I just feel so desperate, like I am part of my grief and my sadness is I feel isolated." Well, how do we get you connected at a time when you also feel kind of desperate. You have this internal dialogue of "I look like I'm like "Will you please be my friend?"" And, and then having some conversation about, "Yeah. That may be how this'll look for a hot second," and so how do you get connections and how do work to be authentic, and if you can do it under these circumstances imagine how much easier it's gonna be when you go out and you're just working on building a life because we are social creatures. We need connections. If you haven't had connections that, again, could be one of the major contributing to this sadness, to this descent, so part of the cure is to get connected in meaningful ways. Okay, now we're gonna invite a client in so you can see how some of these ideas are applied in a clinical session, so we're gonna invite her into the room and talk more about how black women move through descents. Okay, well, (ph)Mayesha, how are you doing today? 

00:21:20
MAYESHA Fine. 

00:21:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, and we're in therapy now so this is like the, the real question about how ya doing. 

00:21:30
MAYESHA Um, I'm fine. 

00:21:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. What does that mean exactly? 

00:21:35
MAYESHA Um, I'm all right. 

00:21:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Your energy seems kind of low. 

00:21:40
MAYESHA Well, you know, um, this just has not been a good day. 

00:21:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW What's been going on? 

00:21:50
MAYESHA Mm, just stuff. Stuff at work. 

00:21:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Just wanna check; is it not a good day or is it not a good longer period? 

00:21:55
MAYESHA Well, I mean, everyday seems not to be a good day . . . 

00:22:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:22:00
MAYESHA . . . these days. 

00:22:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW What are things, kind of things are happening? 

00:22:05
MAYESHA Mm, you know, stuff at work. 

00:22:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Stuff at work? 

00:22:10
MAYESHA Yeah, um, uh, I t-, told you about some of the stuff that goes on there and I get, you know . . . I don't know. I just don't know what to do anymore. I just, um, not really having a lot of . . . 

00:22:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW You know, we talked before about sort of, um, how we name things and, and it's important to name things to be able to change them, and a typical name for some of the things you described in the past, sort of the sadness, the lack of energy, um, sort of negative thoughts, might be called, like, depression, and, and one of the thi- . . . And I . . . You sort of pulled back like that's not a lo-, a label that you like. 

00:22:55
MAYESHA No, I mean, I don't really think I'm would use that word. 

00:23:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, and you know what? It's okay not to use that word, but what we wanna talk about and make sure we pay attention to is what you're feeling and what might be considered symptoms, and so a lot of times, people, um, when I work with women, they might use different language than depression, and that's okay for me, so I've heard it called a "deep sadness," a "heaviness" . . . 

00:23:20
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:23:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW You like the heaviness? 

00:23:25
MAYESHA Yeah, (crosstalk)that's . . . 

00:23:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:23:25
MAYESHA Yeah, that's that . . . Yeah. 

00:23:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW A-, and, and can you tell me more, and it's, what's really important is once we start naming it and sort of understand its nature, and so tell what the heaviness feels like. What's it like to be in the heaviness? 

00:23:40
MAYESHA Like . . . It's like a hi- . . . Like, heavy, like you said, like it's real, like, way down, like it, like it takes so much energy (crosstalk)just for me to get up out of bed and to get in the shower, brush my teeth like every step, like, it's a struggle, like it's just really (crosstalk)hard, like . . . Yeah, (crosstalk)but I know I gotta do it. 

00:24:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)(inaudible) (crosstalk)(inaudible ) Okay, and, and h-, here's good news: you're doing it, but it sounds like it takes tons of energy and tons of effort to do what sound like really basic things, like these are things which would have not taken so much energy before . . . 

00:24:20
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:24:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and have you . . . Did you notice how long . . . When did you first notice the heaviness? 

00:24:30
MAYESHA That's, that's a good question. 

00:24:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:24:30
MAYESHA Um . . . 

00:24:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And d-, and your mind is trying to go back to, sort of like, when you first noticed it, cuz it might've been there before you noticed it. 

00:24:35
MAYESHA Mm- (crosstalk)hmm. 

00:24:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)And so a lot of (crosstalk)times it's easy, like, "I'm feeling something but I'm gonna push through it." 

00:24:40
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:24:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW It's like you, (ph)gwhatch you can do with the flu maybe for a little bit, but then there's a while where it all catches up so (crosstalk)if you can try to think back to "When did I first notice this?" 

00:24:50
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Um . . . 

00:24:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW That it was an effort and the heaviness . . . 

00:25:00
MAYESHA Well it's feel like it's been actually a while, so, maybe, maybe about a year. 

00:25:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW So for a year you've been under a lot of extra weight, extra pressure. 

00:25:15
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And, here there's actually a little piece of good news in this, if you wanna hear it, that you've been able to push for a year, but I, I think it's probably catching up with you. 

00:25:25
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay? And you talked about, like there are things at work that are hard . . . 

00:25:30
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and so how does that affect the heaviness? 

00:25:35
MAYESHA It . . . I have to do my best at work like, no questions, but it makes it harder for me to interact with my co-workers. 

00:25:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-hmm. 

00:25:50
MAYESHA Um, I feel like they're watching my every move. 

00:25:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-hmm. 

00:25:50
MAYESHA You know? And so I have to, you know . . . 

00:25:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Watch your every move? 

00:25:55
MAYESHA I have to watch my o- . . . I mean, that's something . . . I think that's something that happens anyway. 

00:26:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Right. 

00:26:00
MAYESHA Like, you know, as a black woman I gotta, like, I have to do better. 

00:26:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW For . . . You gotta do 150%. 

00:26:10
MAYESHA That . . . Yeah, cuz people be watching me like, you know, I don't know how to explain it, but they watch, and they may waiting for me to mess up or, you know, so I just, um . . . I mean, that's just been my life, I guess, but, so . . . (crosstalk)I don't know. 

00:26:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Y-, you know, that kinda sounds exhausting. 

00:26:25
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:26:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW You know, even (crosstalk)though you've been doing all your life, I . . . That would . . . I mean, especially at a time when you already are feeling a lot of heaviness . . . 

00:26:30
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:26:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and then you have this extra burden of having to, to watch to not make mistakes . . . 

00:26:40
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:26:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and to know from your own senses like . . . And it's . . . Some of there is a racial component to this. So as a black woman I don't have the luxury of making a mistake and even though I've had this heaviness in my life I gotta keep pushing through that. There's no room to make mistakes at work. 

00:27:00
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:27:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And so even if we're using the language like depression, it's like there's the oppression and the depression. (crosstalk)There's the oppressive stuff that's happening and then there is the h-, heaviness of moving through it. Is that . . . 

00:27:15
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:27:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:27:20
MAYESHA (crosstalk)I'm . . . 

00:27:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Have you thought about it that way before? 

00:27:20
MAYESHA No, I haven't thought it about it like that. 

00:27:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, and, and how does thinking about it that way change anything for you? 

00:27:30
MAYESHA Well, I mean, I never thought about it like that. It's something else that could be something else. Like . . . 

00:27:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW But you think it was all inside? 

00:27:40
MAYESHA Yeah, like, you know, there's something wrong with me, I'm crazy, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm not . . . I don't wanna have a mental problem, you know what I'm (crosstalk)saying? 

00:27:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Yeah, that, that's not a club that very many people wanna join. (crosstalk)It's like, I get that, and so, being able to understand that there might be things outside of you that are making this difficult or, or creating this reaction or maintaining or exacerbating reaction helps in some way? 

00:28:00
MAYESHA (crosstalk)So . . . Yeah. 

00:28:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:28:05
MAYESHA Yeah, cuz . . . Yeah, (crosstalk)then it's not . . . 

00:28:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)It's not just me. 

00:28:05
MAYESHA Yeah, (crosstalk)it's not (crosstalk)just me. It's not (crosstalk)just me. 

00:28:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)It's like . . . (crosstalk)It's just . . . (crosstalk)It's you. It's y- . . . B-, but . . . And, and I think it is important just to understand that because you, you can sort of push, push, push to make the changes in you and if you're not getting movement it can start to make you feel really hopeless and, and so that's why it's important to (ph)corda widen that lens, to say, "Okay, am I reacting to anything? Is anything aggravating the heaviness?", and certainly if what you're feeling is I gotta be almost hyper- vigilant. I gotta be on guard. 

00:28:40
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:28:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW That really can complicate a sadness that's already in place. 

00:28:45
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:28:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And do you feel that there's lots of judgement? It can sort of drain your battery where you're always sort of standing guard. 

00:28:55
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:28:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Does that make sense? 

00:28:55
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:28:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And so that's what we gotta talk about: the oppression that affects you as a black, (ph)have a African-American person, as a woman, and as a lesbian. It's like you got multiple places where oppression can show up . . . 

00:29:10
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:29:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and I think it's really important to sort of name that and then figure out what do we do about it once we name it. 

00:29:20
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:29:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:29:20
MAYESHA Cuz, like, there's stuff that, like, they can do . . . Like, I work with a lot of, like a, uh, uh, d-, department with just white women (crosstalk)and I'm the only black woman . . . 

00:29:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:29:30
MAYESHA . . . and they can do stuff that I can't do. 

00:29:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Well . . . So what are some examples of that? 

00:29:35
MAYESHA Like, this one woman, like, she likes to take off early to go to Macy's, like, sales that they have. They have Macy's sales (crosstalk)and she's like, "The Macy's sale is happening! I'm gonna be late!", or, "The Macy's sale! I have to leave early!", and she tells everybody including the boss and it's okay, but if I would need to take off cuz I'm sick, which is even more important than a Macy's sale, then I can feel the energy the next day, like everyone's like . . . I can feel it. I (crosstalk)can feel them looking at me like, "Oh yeah. Sure you were sick.", or, you know, stuff like that. 

00:30:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. So judgements. The weight of the ju- . . . The weight of the judgements. You (crosstalk)can sort of see the heaviness and the weight of the judgements . . . 

00:30:15
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:30:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and it's about saying what's your perception; how do you feel that and the fact that this is going on? That there's seems like there a double standard . . . 

00:30:25
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . which can be draining. 

00:30:25
MAYESHA (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:30:28
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)You know, one of the things, you know, we, and we, you, as you've been talking about this, um, heaviness, whether you call it depression or a heaviness or a, a deep sadness and the oppression . . . Is that . . . I wanna talk to you about a concept that I use a lot which is descent, and I . . . It's like a . . . It's just story-telling mode. I, I don't know if you've ever hear like the hero's journey or the heroine's journey is that, often times, when something is happening in someone's life and they're about to move beyond where they've been before, it's like they leave home, the g- . . . Like, where that's Red Riding Hood or Lord of the Rings . . . They've leave what is (ph)dome and they go on a adventure and often times in that adventure there's a place that they get low, they get hopeless, they, they go down the rabbit hole and it's a descent, and the way I like to think women, especially black women and these sadnesses that it's a process and that descent of going down and sometimes it's really, really scary, very, very scary. She doesn't feel controlled. 

00:31:25
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:31:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW But if you can sort of see this descent and it's, it's got a bottom to it and that part of that process is that once I hit that bottom, whenever it looks like, I can figure out what's going on and begin my ascent, like I gotta go down, touch that part, but I find something out about myself in it, so the depression isn't something that just breaks you. It can be something that cracks you open and in that sadness you can find something. Now you're looking at me like, "Uh, that doesn't . . ." What, what's the look? 

00:32:00
MAYESHA Well I'm trying to understand what you're saying . . . 

00:32:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:32:00
MAYESHA . . . and I never thought about it like that and I was, like, picturing myself going down the rabbit hole like you were saying (crosstalk)like going down and down and down and, and uh, I just never, like, thought (crosstalk)of it like that. 

00:32:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Yeah, and, and h-, and so it's just a different way, but . . . And I, I like to use that language because I feel like it's more hopeful. It's like, (crosstalk)"I'm going down there.", and what happens in rabbit holes? People get transformed. 

00:32:25
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm. 

00:32:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And it's not about just being broken. It's about getting transformed because it's sort of like we were talking earlier about the things at work and looking at the oppression and the ways that people interact and how you might have some internal sadness and heaviness, but there were external things. You've gotta down a rabbit hole, almost, to notice the bigger picture. Does that make sense? Like, (crosstalk)you didn't come in thinking, "Oh, oppression is part of my problem." Th- . . . Does this language help you think about this differently or . . . 

00:32:55
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah, cuz . . . Well, I mean, sort of . . . Like, I'm thinking of Alice in Wonderland . . . 

00:33:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Right. 

00:33:00
MAYESHA Cuz you said the rabbit hole (crosstalk)and, and I'm thinking like all this stuff she went through and how she had to come out of it, you know, and . . . 

00:33:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Right. And . . . 

00:33:15
MAYESHA Yeah, like . . . And then the . . . All these people she met o-, on the way. 

00:33:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Yeah, and some of them go to Macy's sales and some of them, uh, have double standards, and some of them . . . And then . . . And in that, though, you learn how to (ph)one name it but also what's my strategy if I'm in a place where there's a double standard that, whether it's based on race, gender, sexual orientation, class . . . Whatever, like, "I gotta figure how to cope with this but maintain my sense of self. I gotta stay clear about who I am in the middle, sometimes, of other people's oppressive behaviors." 

00:33:50
MAYESHA Yeah but like, when do I get, like, when do I get a chance to, like, just, cry? Like, when do I get a chance to just stay in bed all day one day, you know, without being judged for it, without, you know, everybody looking at me and thinking I'm this lazy black woman or whatever, you know? Like when do I get my chance . . . 

00:34:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW To break down. 

00:34:15
MAYESHA . . . to . . . Yeah, to break down. 

00:34:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Yeah, a-, and here's the thing, a-, and part of it is you . . . What are you feeling right now, cuz I notice you're tearing up and . . . 

00:34:25
MAYESHA It's just, it's just hard. You know? I'm just . . . It's (crosstalk)not fair. It's not fair (crosstalk)and I'm tired. 

00:34:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Tired. (crosstalk)It's, it's, it's not fair and you're tired, but here's the thing that I heard you say that I wanna hand back to you, is claiming the right to feel sad, to feel tired and then take that space. Now . . . Cuz you're saying like, "I'm not feeling well. I got a right to be sick, sad . . . Whatever. And it's not fair that people then judge me.", and I also heard in that is this other thing. It's like carrying on for the race like you gotta represent for all black women that have ever been called lazy. 

00:35:00
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:35:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Right? And here's the thing: that's why understanding the history . . . Now, are black women, if you look at a historical view of us, a lazy people? Who goes out, captures lazy people and hold them in captivity for years? 

00:35:15
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:35:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW So it's not a true . . . It never was a true story, but then it's used to sort of push and drive you today so that when you even are not feeling well and you're trying to get well . . . It's like the tools that you would use like . . . Take into your bed a little bit, going a little (ph)Victorian? Um, don't feel like there are options for you. I also heard in, when you were talking about that, uh, some anger almost. Was there outrage? 

00:35:45
MAYESHA Yeah. (crosstalk)I mean, it's sad too . . . It's . . . I'm, I'm pissed, you know? 

00:35:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Okay. Mm-hmm, and here's the thing: it's, it's both, and, and so how much room was there for black women to be angry in work settings? 

00:36:00
MAYESHA Oh, I, I can't be. I just . . . I mean, cuz this . . . Then it's the angry black woman. It's like I don't . . . There's no fucking room for me to move. 

00:36:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Right, a-, and here's the thing: it's, it's . . . And so . . . Which creates more heaviness, so do you see the nature of the heaviness as we start to unpack it? It's like I don't have time to even be sick and tired of being sick and tired and go (inaudible ) . . . 

00:36:25
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:36:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and when I try to take care of myself that's gets judged and when I get outraged by the, what I see around me that gets judged and so what emotions are left for you to experience if you can't be angry, you can't be sad, you can't be tired . . . Are you allowed to be scared? Mm-kay, so do you understand that w-, with this descent, with this sadness, with what people might call depression, the numbness that comes with that might be connect to the fact that you're getting shut down on all the feelings that you're allowed to feel so nothing's left? 

00:37:00
MAYESHA Hm. 

00:37:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, what was that? 

00:37:00
MAYESHA Yeah, I mean, nothing's left. What's left? 

00:37:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-kay, so now we gotta go back and start opening up those feelings, so reclaiming - and this is tricky . . . "I will reclaim my deep sadness." (inaudible) you do? You have a right to it cuz you can't heal it if you conceal it. "I gotta reclaim my outrage. This isn't fair. And then what do I do about it?" But firstly, first we have to figure out "I have that feeling and I'm gonna acknowledge it." So how's it feel for you to acknowledge tired and angry and sad? 

00:37:35
MAYESHA Feels good. 

00:37:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-kay, so even though it's i-, there's tearing up it feels good that you get to feel, have feelings right? 

00:37:45
MAYESHA Yeah, that it's okay that I can do that, (crosstalk)like, with you at least. 

00:37:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah, and here's the thing: this is the safe place. This is the safe place that we create together for you to show up in the fullness of your emotion and we're not gonna rush through tears and we're just gonna be with 'em, okay? We're just be with them because when was the last time you've had time and permission to be a sad, angry, powerful black woman who's outraged at oppression? Okay. 

00:38:25
MAYESHA Never. 

00:38:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. Can part of it . . . But now that you acknowledge it, how does this change you? Or does it? 

00:38:40
MAYESHA I just feel like . . . I don't know. I got . . . I have some sort of right to feeling what I feel. 

00:38:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-hmm, and it, and even though it's hard there's a little flicker of power in that, like, "I've got a right to feel crappy if (ph)duth (ph)else." 

00:38:55
MAYESHA Yeah. Yes. 

00:39:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW "And I can go back and look at what got me to feeling this way.", which then says, "What do I begin to work to change either individually or collectively with other people to get this (ph)heavidess off of me?" 

00:39:15
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:39:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And some of the heaviness may be a foot that someone is holding you down. 

00:39:20
MAYESHA Mm. 

00:39:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW So it's not all internal. Th- . . . It might catch the internal pleas but we gotta talk about what is sitting on top of you too. 

00:39:35
MAYESHA Mm. 

00:39:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:39:35
Later in the session... 

00:39:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)So, you know, we've been ha-, having a lot of conversation the last couple sessions about the nature of this heaviness and it as a in- . . . And so (ph)the (ph)snoozi- . . . Using this language of it being a descent, um, and so if we look at that sort of heroine's journey kind of descent we wanna talk about the things that are gonna get you out of it, whether it be allies you can bring in the play, uh, or the resources that you can bring in the play, um, and when people go on an adventure, sometimes, one of the things that they have as part of their adventure in their, their tool kit, or their medicine bag, or their spiritual values and so I always like to ask people, "Do you have a spiritual tradition that can support you in this healing process, and, and if so, how?," so I'd like you to sort of think about . . . Is there . . . What's your spiritual practice and how it could be of support as you move through this heaviness? 

00:40:30
MAYESHA Well, I, I definitely have a strong spiritual, um, background and community. 

00:40:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-kay. 

00:40:35
MAYESHA Um, so, um . . . 

00:40:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (ph)Can (ph)you (ph)say more about that? 

00:40:45
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Well . . . 

00:40:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)You seem like you're hes- . . . You seem a little hesitant to talk about it; what's going on? 

00:40:45
MAYESHA Well, it's not very traditional . . . 

00:40:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-kay. 

00:40:50
MAYESHA . . . so . . . But, um, I'm a pagan (crosstalk)and, you know, I just, I practice lots of different types of earth-based spiritualities. 

00:40:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Mm-kay. Okay. 

00:41:00
MAYESHA So . . . And that's important to me, like, women's spirituality . . . 

00:41:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:41:00
MAYESHA . . . and stuff like that. 

00:41:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW One thing I wanna be really clear about is your traditions are your traditions and they have a space in this work and when you start talking about it you actually brighten up. You seemed hesitant at first but once you started talking about your community and earth-based spirituality and, uh, rituals and traditions, you brightened up. 

00:41:25
MAYESHA Yeah, I mean it . . . That makes me feel good. 

00:41:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. We need to have that in the room. Anything that makes you feel good, that's legal, we need to have in the room . . . 

00:41:35
MAYESHA (ph)Good. 

00:41:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and so . . . And it's about it is your everyday life and the more things that are part of your everyday life, um, that you can use and bring to bear to move the heaviness, we really wanna be able to acknowledge, so you start talking about pagan traditions . . . There's, often times, rituals that people use and times of the years and gatherings . . . Are those things that you've been able to use around the heaviness? 

00:42:00
MAYESHA I hadn't thought about it. I kinda was slacking off a (crosstalk)little bit and, you know, I missed a couple of things and rituals that I could've gone to and, you know, and I don't meditate as much as I, I used to, so maybe I could start, you know, pushing myself to do that (crosstalk)again, you know, since usually when I do it I feel so much better. 

00:42:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah, a-, absolutely. It's something. If you're, if you're very used to, um, having rituals you could also create a ritual around your coming out of this descent and just think about that, you know? Like, what's a way that you . . . So consider (ph)working for anchors to bring you out of this and if you've got tools at work for you we definitely wanna use them, mm-kay? You know, we've, we've talked about a lot of stuff. We had some tentative goals, uh, earlier, but I, I like to talk about goals in a slightly different way, so, you know, you've been able to sort of follow me with some new language, and I really appreciate that, um, but when I think about goals I think of it in terms of hopes and dreams cuz I like to really (ph)want is have them be positive, and I think those are just part of our lives anyway, and if in therapy I (ph)can't help you figure out how to do your life . . . That's really the work of it that we're doing together, so I want you to think about what are your hopes for yourself and then when I say that, what does that even mean for you? What are your hopes and dreams for yourself? 

00:43:25
MAYESHA Well I, I hope I can, like . . . I hope I can enjoy my life again. That's what I hope. 

00:43:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, so the most immediate hope is that I can get back to enjoying my life. I'm gonna push you a little bit further on that, and this is okay; this is where the dreaming part comes in too, um, is . . . Do you have a picture of that? Like, what that life beyond this heaviness would look like and feel like? 

00:43:50
MAYESHA Hm . . . 

00:43:55
[sil.] 

00:44:00
MAYESHA Well, I would definitely be practicing my spirituality with my friends (crosstalk)and my community. 

00:44:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:44:05
MAYESHA I'd be out doing the things that I love like . . . I also do work on the side like energy work. 

00:44:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:44:15
MAYESHA I would like to do that more. 

00:44:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:44:15
MAYESHA You know? 

00:44:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Let me ask a quick question about that. Are you using the energy healing on yourself for this? Ooh. What's that look? Not so much? 

00:44:25
MAYESHA No. 

00:44:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, just wanna add that that's a (ph)toofer in my mind. One: it's something that helps you, and two: it's part of the manifesting your hopes and dreams, right? (crosstalk)And one of the things you talked about before was like being a healer . . . 

00:44:40
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:44:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and it's okay to be a wounded healer and use your gifts to be healed but that it's also puts you, moves you forward around this hope and dream of being a healer. So you be . . . And more involved in your spiritual practices, you'd be doing more of your energy work? 

00:45:00
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:45:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW For yourself and others? 

00:45:05
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:45:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (inaudible ) 

00:45:07
MAYESHA Self. 

00:45:07
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Yeah, and that's okay. It's really okay because what you can now show people is "I have come through it." 

00:45:15
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:45:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW "I come through this.", and that's really powerful to be able to say, "I know this could be healed. I've been there." Okay? What are some other hopes and dreams that would be part of your life past the heaviness? It's okay to dream big too. (crosstalk)Dream big. Can you? 

00:45:35
MAYESHA (crosstalk)(inaudible) Um, I mean, sure. I can dream big. I, I would love to be able to - I know it sounds weird right now, cuz, um, of the place that I'm been in for this (crosstalk)long and . . . But I would love to be able to be a motivational speaker. 

00:45:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Yeah. Absolutely. 

00:45:55
MAYESHA That . . . But . . . When I feel, when I used to feel good that . . . That's how . . . That's what I wanted, and, I don't know. (crosstalk)So . . . 

00:46:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Here's the thing: so, you said it's like, you know, "It sounds kind of weird given where I'm at right now.", but again, we're dreaming because that's what pulls you forward. It's like the Batman belt. You sh- . . . You know, old-school Batman. And he shot out and climbed up the wall, you know? He didn't start out at the top of the building and so what you wanna have an anchoring goal or dream. Then we gotta figure out that, "Yeah, it can happen, and this is how it can happen step-by- step.", so I want you to dream big. If that was your passion at some point the, the more you can get connected with "Oh. I don't how to do it right this moment, but I remember that being my passion." That begins to lift you up a bit. 

00:46:45
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:46:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Y- . . . Okay, does that make (crosstalk)sense? So I do want you to dream big and one of the things that, um, you know, if they move along, we've got our (ph)individual work and I think that's really important, but I also have some workshops that are coming up and two of them might be really, um, of interest to you. One is called Diving Deep and Surfacing, which is a group, a collection. It's a one-day workshop with African-American women who are experiencing these emotional descents or depression, and so it's a way to sort of get reality checks but also to get reminded that people have this experience and they move through it, so that's one workshop. The other one is called Black Girls Dreaming, and it's, for me it's about the other side of the depression, the other side of the descent where you reclaim your dreams, because, often times, with black women, they get disconnected from our dreams really early on as little girls, so that's why I call it Black Girls Dreaming, cuz it's like you have to go back and get that little girl . . . 

00:47:45
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. 

00:47:50
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and so the little girl can get separated from her dreams because of traumatic, wounding experience where she's just working to survive and she can get disconnected on the other extreme because she's following other people's agendas for her, other people's expectations and so part of it is stopping and saying, "If you're not . . . If you're out of reaction mode, what do you want? What do you dream? And so can you even imagine if you were (ph)out of reaction mode who would you be? You're (crosstalk)smiling. What's . . . (ph)Come on. 

00:48:20
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah cuz that's . . . I mean, like you're saying, in-, instead of living whatever people tell you . . . 

00:48:25
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Mm-hmm. 

00:48:25
MAYESHA Then yeah, I can picture being amazing. 

00:48:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. Tell me more about the amazing. 

00:48:30
MAYESHA Like, um, uh, I wanna do workshops. Like, you talking about your workshop . . . I wanna do workshops. 

00:48:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:48:35
MAYESHA I wanna talk to other black women like me and, you know, about the spirituality and the energy work, that we can do that too, you know? 

00:48:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay. 

00:48:45
MAYESHA I don't know. I just . . . (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:48:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW (crosstalk)Okay, so here's the thing: what's stopping you? Okay. Okay. Did you notice your energy shift? (ph)We're (ph)gonna (ph)do some energy. You notice how your . . . Cuz you were like there, there, there, bigger, bigger, bigger . . . 

00:48:55
MAYESHA Uh- huh. 

00:49:00
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Smiling now, all right? Bigger, bigger, bigger. What dropped you back? 

00:49:05
MAYESHA Uh, felt a little like fear. 

00:49:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, here's the thing: I want you to notice the difference between being depressed or sad and feeling fearful . . . 

00:49:15
MAYESHA Mm. 

00:49:15
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . cuz I think it's really hard for people . . . Often times, people will read fear as a sadness and the tired because it's happened so fast. They go from excited . . . Fear shows up and goes, "I'm here!", and all of a sudden it's like really fast: they see always . . . And it's not gonna happen and they're suddenly sad . . . 

00:49:35
MAYESHA Mm. 

00:49:35
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . and what they miss is there's something between fear showing up, having this really intense conversation with yourself and it ending up in, in more sadness, and I think as you're coming out of a descent it's gonna be really important to be able to notice is fear in the house. 

00:49:55
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:49:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW And I think it . . . The . . . I think it's Rumi or Osho . . . These spiritual teachers that, that talk about don't move the way that fear wants you to move. 

00:50:00
MAYESHA Hm. 

00:50:05
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW It's like don't move the way that racism wants you to move, or sexism or homophobia, so anytime fear is up you wanna stop it and clear it up or at least know it's in the room . . . 

00:50:20
MAYESHA Mm-hmm. 

00:50:20
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . so that you . . . Which means you get it out of the driver's seat, cuz fear doesn't take you anywhere that's gonna be fun, so if fear's in the driver's seat you need to stop . . . 

00:50:30
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:50:30
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW . . . stop the vehicle and you get back in charge, (crosstalk)so it's really important that you notice that connection and, and I think that's because you're, you're already . . . This is why I'm sort of, (ph)I (ph)would sort of pushing you about your own energy work. 

00:50:40
MAYESHA (crosstalk)Mm. Mm-hmm. 

00:50:40
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW It's also your emotional work. You are the expert on you. I don't care how badly you feel. 

00:50:45
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:50:45
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Now that can be scary sometimes when you're feeling really low but the truth is you know a lot of things about yourself and you're the one that picked up on the fear, not me. 

00:50:55
MAYESHA Mm. 

00:50:55
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Okay, so don't let fear get in the way of your hopes and dreams. So your homework assignment is I want you to go back and I want you to write down all those big dreams and when we come back next week we'll talk about how to make them happen, okay? 

00:51:10
MAYESHA Okay. 

00:51:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Got it? 

00:51:10
MAYESHA Yeah. 

00:51:10
VANESSA JACKSON, LCSW Cool.
