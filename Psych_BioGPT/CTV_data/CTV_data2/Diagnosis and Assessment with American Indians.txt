"Diagnosis and Assessment of American Indians" - Joseph Trimble, Ph.D. - Joseph Gane, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
JOSEPH TRIMBLE Good afternoon. Hope you all had a good lunch. We did. In Lakota, which is the language of my ancestors, anpetu waste. Means "good day to you, my friends." Joe Gane or, otherwise known among our friends as Joe the Younger and me, Joe the Elder, uh, obviously, are, he was gonna go first, but we had some logistic problems here, so I decided to go first and then Joe will follow up. Um, sorry about the background here, but that's just the way it is. Here's the theme. And, as many of you know, this is a photo of Margaret Mead, uh, but you don't know, maybe you don't, that's a photo of William Fielding Ogburn who was, uh, her his mentor, or her mentor, rather, at Columbia when she was a graduate student in anthropology in the 1920s. And Ogburn was one who insisted that never look for a psychological explanation unless every effort to find a cultural one has been exhausted. Unfortunately, those words have not been heeded and it seems to be the other way around. Well, we would like to insist that we take this perspective from a slightly different point of view. Um, before I go on, there is a handout that, uh, I have prepared that lists all the references and citations plus a, a figure that I will refer to in the very last slide. So in case you want to follow up on anything that we talk about and learn a little bit more about it, here they are. This slide, uh, we're gonna see a video, and I want you to pay very close attention to its content, because it has everything to do with, uh, measurement equivalence that Zorni talked about earlier. And the video is in black and white and it was shot in a small Inuit Northern Canadian village and it had to do with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Let's hope my connection to the internet works and gets me there. This reads "The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is the most widely-used self-report measure of impulsiveness personality traits. Initially developed in the United States, it is apparently ostensibly available for use across cultures. And subject, several members of subject 101 or 1, 12 are being interviewed about, uh, Charlie with the

UNKNOWN But often he says something he doesn't want to say? 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Rarely. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Or I don't know, but sometimes he says things you don't want him to say? He likes to think about complicated problems.

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Sometimes. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Sometimes? 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. But when you walk slow, he can walk slow too. So I don't know if he walks fast or you walk fast or when you walk slow, he can walk slow too, often. But sometimes he walk fast. Yeah. 

00:05:20

JOSEPH TRIMBLE Well, uh, you get the, you get the idea. Um, I can't tell you how many times, uh, this scene is played out by a number of us who sit in this audience when we attempt to use forced choice options in a quote, unquote "standardized," ostensibly reliable valid measure of x, y, and z and the respondent is, if it's done orally, potentially goes into tangents such as we witnessed on the screen. I'll be glad to send you this, this link which is on, uh, YouTube, and it goes on. It, it gets even more interesting and it's quite humorous at times. Let me get back to my slides. So let me give you my definition of cultural equivalence. Um, it actually goes back to 1983, and this is Ype Poortinga. He's a Dutch cross-cultural psychologist, now emeritus, who says, and he was the first one to define it, and he says, "To the problem of whether, on the basis of measurements and observations, inferences in terms of some common psychological dimension can be made in different groups of people." Um, that definition really hasn't changed all that much, and as Zorni pointed out to you this morning, there are different kinds of measurement equivalences, as, as, as they're referred to. That second one is conceptual equivalence, the third one is stimulus equivalence, and the fourth is linguistic equivalence, and finally, one I prefer to call metric equivalence. In, in effect, well, I'll get to that point later. So what are the response styles of culturally different respondents? First of all, not all cultural groups evaluate and assess stimuli in a linear manner. Secondly, the number of salient choice options can vary from individual to individual both within and between societal groups. It's interesting to note that some of the research that has been used with fixed-choice Likert-type scales in Asia, particularly China, um, they prefer not to, to choose the extreme categories. And this is very commonplace. And, um, we can go on. Respondents are difficult for, responses are difficult for some because they don't yet understand what the collective will accept. The conventional psychometric format common to paper and pencil tests and instruments may not work in all cultural and ethnic groups, and the need to capture information through a paper and pencil approach may be inconsistent and unrelated to emic styles of information sharing. One of the problems is that we lean back on the work of the psychophysicist Stevens and his two books in 1946 and 1951, holds that measurement is the assignment of numbers, uh, or numerals to objects or, strictly speaking, attributes of objects according to a consistent rule. This presumes measurement rather than defines what has to be filled, fulfilled to constitute measurement. Data are immediately seen as measures. This seems to be so embedded in the construction of standardized tests and attitude questionnaires that few people question what they're really doing. Now we have a problem and I'm gonna take an extreme, uh, relative, um, uh, perspective on, on cross-culture research. There are some who contend that comparing elements from differing societies leads to inadmissible distortions of reality. Continuing, Douglas Price-Williams once said, "Our own categories of explanation and definition, embedded in our own psychological theories may not be appropriate when projected on some other culture." Walter Goldschmidt, an anthropologist, quoting Malinowski, says that he "was most insistent that every culture be understood in its own terms, that every institution be seen as a product of the culture within which it developed. It follows from this that a cross-cultural comparison of institutions is essentially a false enterprise, for we are comparing incomparables." And finally, Durkheim of course had words to say about this, and he said, "Social facts are functions of the social system of which they are a part. Therefore they cannot be understood when they are detached." Zorni mentioned the work of Johnson, who actually identified 52 kinds of measurement equivalence, and he contends that there is no other phenomena in the field of cross-cultural psychology that has so many definitions aside from the word "culture" itself. John Berry says, "All right, how do we get around this? How do we, how do we cut through all the problems that have to do with equivalence?" And so his first bullet says that we have to demonstrate that the behaviors to be compared are functionally equivalent. Secondly, existing categories and concepts then can be applied to the behavior and systems in a tentative way. Notice he says "tentative." The imposed etic, bringing it from the outside, must be modified so that it becomes an adequate description from, from within each culture being studied. With a derived etic, my way of thinking, measurement tools and techniques can be devised that meet the standards for cultural equivalence. We have a lot to say about that. But let me segue quickly into our research that's occurring in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region of Western Alaska with the Yupik. They used to be referred to as Eskimo. They themselves have dropped the word. It's pejorative, it means in one, in one language "meat-eater" and they refer to themselves as Yupiks, which in the Yupik language means "the people." At any rate, uh, we've been doing research with the Yupik, that actually should say "we" at the University of Alaska Fairbanks where I'm a, uh, president's professor. And we've been doing research with the Yupik and Yupik elders. And give you an idea of what this place looks like. I don't know if this shows up on your screen, but that's, that's what you see when you go there in, in summertime or late winter or early spring. In the summertime, it's dark. It's like, you don't, I mean, the wintertime is dark. So that's where our research takes place. So one of our concerns is language translation. And so one of, one of the, one of our approaches in enabling our responses to answer questions in their own, own language can, can derive, or generate benefits. One, it's increases the opportunity for participant, um, inclusion. It enhances their comfort for participants to express themselves. It's usually a rich, meaningful exchange of culturally grounded knowledge. And it's potential for enhanced trustworthiness of the data. In the process of collecting data, this is the sequence that we go through. We have a series of English questions that were developed in consultation with elders and key, key leaders in these various very small villages of about 250 to 300 people apiece, and they're very isolated. Um, so we sit down and we say, "What is it that, how can we frame this that it's translated into Yupik?" Um, then we generate Yupik responses that are translated into English responses. And then we check and check and check and then disseminate. Now, the project that we're involved in has to do with stress, depression, coping, health, and genetics, for which there is no equivalent Yupik lexicon. In short, when we started this research, we were approached by the elders from several villages, uh, in Fairbanks, deeply concerned about the overwhelming, um, increase in violence, abuse, alcoholism, drug abuse, drug, alcoholism in villages that are dry, um, not to mention the increase in crime, increase in diabetes 2, and the increase in obesity. And this, these are the things that never existed before, and they didn't know what to do about it, they didn't know how to cope with it, and they wanted our help. And when we asked them what their lexicon for stress was, they all looked at one another and said, "We don't have one." And then we talked about depression, "We don't have one." "What do you mean by 'coping?' We don't know what that means." And "What do you mean by 'health?' We don't know what that means." And yet they wanted us to introduce a, an intervention from their world view when we and they didn't really understood, understand what stress really was, although they kept using the word in English. So our problem was, with their guidance and assistance, try to find out what it was that created this. And what was very interesting about it, the typical psychologist, well, why don't you administer some, some, some depression or, uh, stress scale? And of course, that was totally, totally out of the question. Could not be done. So we had to take a grounded ethnography approach, again, constantly interacting with the folks from various villages. 

00:16:25
ELLEN LOPEZ This is a great challenge given the focus of the Stress and Coping Project. Most elders speak of a little bit of English, so when conducting interviews with Yupik elders, Eliza tries to gauge their level of comfort to answer in English. First, she tries to ask the question in English, and then allows time for them to collect their thoughts. If this doesn't seem to work for them, she then takes the challenge of translating the question to Yupik. This can be quite challenging, especially when there's no equivalent word to use. So her task is to ask questions that are not leading that maintain consistency across respondents and maintain validity across languages. For example, to ask the question "What does stress mean to you?" she needs to be prepared with several ways of describing stress consistently across respondents. To give you some examples, here are some ways that Eliza tries to ask the meaning of stress question. Nallunritan-qa "stress?" Do you know "stress?" Icugg', caarkalissiiyaakuvet? You know when you have too much to do? Icugg', irniavet tuavvluten? You know when your kids are distracting you? 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN That's universal. 

00:17:40
JOSEPH TRIMBLE Yeah. They essentially have, you just saw two lexicons or two phrases that they've come up with to describe what stress means to them. The third one is when things go wrong in your head. Um, and it's interesting that they pathologize this experience that they have that, that they're experiencing every day. So looking at this whole notion of translating. It's not just straightforward translation, back translation, and so forth. This is a very engaged process, and we could be sitting in somebody's house with three or four people, going over the transcript in, um, in English, back and forth and back and forth in Yupik and arguing over what each word or each lexicon means till we get it right. So it's, we have to avoid paraphrasing. And it's important to, to, to be consistent, especially with non-equivalent words and concepts. So yeah, we use the word "stress," but then they come back and they say in Yupik how they now understand stress to be, which isn't really stress. It's just something that happens in their way of life. And it's a constant interaction process with elders, um, in these villages to ensure that our translations are correct. And the important thing, you, you heard, that was Ellen Lopez, who's on the faculty in the psychology department at, uh, Fairbanks. She was describing Eliza Orr, who's one of our translators who is Yupik who lives in Fairbanks, and she understands the language thoroughly; English is her second language. So it's important to understand the themes and codes that emerge from this process. So yes, indeed, we conducted interviews with them, and they were quite lengthy. Sometimes they extended over several days. Well, that's what you have to do. And so what do you do with interview data when you're trying to understand how a particular, um, Alaska native village deals with this notion of stress brought on by rapid socio-cultural change that they've never experienced before in their lives? So we, we treated the, um, the, the interview data with, um, a content analysis program called Atlas T. And the idea was to extract out the key words and then Atlas T allows you to create a co-occurance matrix. What words or what concepts occur most frequently or least frequently with others? And on that last page of the handout you'll see a social network diagram. Here it is on the screen. And this is what it looks like. What's important here is that when I created this social network from the co-occurant matrix using social network analysis software, actually I worked with a couple of my graduate students on this, what you see is the interface or the interconnectedness of all of these problems that the people were expressing. And if you follow the, we call it "edges" in network analysis, very closely from one node to another, you can see that at least at an intuitive level, they make sense. Now, just stepping back for just a couple of seconds before I finish, what this means is if you design an intervention to get at, let's say, alcoholism and drug abuse, you're, you're eliminating and you're, you're, you're not factoring in the contributions of the other variables or the other elements that also feed into alcoholism and substance abuse. In short, you almost have to deal with everything that you see in this network diagram in order to prevent and intervene. By isolating solely on suicide, which is very high in these villages, you exclude all of those other factors that contribute to high suicide rates or high suicide attempts. Looking at this from a network perspective, you can see that all of these elements are interconnected. And by, of course they are because none of these things happen in isolation, and they're all context-based. So from our point of view, using a grounded ethnography gave us the data that we already knew, and when we showed them, um, this network diagram, they all laughed and they said, "Of course." I turn this over to my colleague, Joe. 

00:22:15
JOSEPH GANE Terrific. Thank you. Um, and so one thing that Joseph asked me to do was to hand all a bit of overview to you just so you have a better sense of the context for American native and Alaskan native health. Um, American Indians and Alaskan Indians are the surviving descendents of the indigenous peoples of North America. There was really terrific diversity, which is probably the single most important take-home point here. Um, compared to, say, language families that structured the peoples of Europe, there were maybe a handful, but in native North America there were scores of language families that of course produced a great deal of cultural difference. Our populations are characterized by a dramatic geographic rebound. There were between 5 million and 12 million indigenous peoples north of Mexico by the time of contact, but through disease and colonization, conquest, uh, that number plummeted to 240,000 people around 1890 or so. Obviously, there's been a rebound since then, high birth rates. Uh, if you look at the U.S. census today, you'll see, depending on whether people are saying they're Indian alone, that's 2.9 million, or in combination with some other race, you have 5.2 million. Um, one thing that's really important to underscore with regard to American Indians is that lots and lots of Americans have American Indian ancestry, usually distant and not much known about it, but what's really of concern for trying to create general knowledge about American Indian mental health is to focus on, uh, political status of American Indian people, that is, those who are tribal members, and there are 565 federally-recognized tribes in the United States today. Um, and there are more than that, tribal members that are state-recognized tribes and so on, but it does create a bit of a problem when you aren't specifying whether you're talking about tribal members or not in your research. Um, Indians occupy a really distinctive political status with regard to tribal sovereignty. These 565 federally-recognized tribes have a history of treaty making, which means they're nations within a nation. That incurs a certain federal trust obligation by the United States federal government that means that our healthcare services at reservation settings are, uh, uh, a matter of federal trust in terms of that delivery, and it creates a really distinctive service ecology in reservation settings and in some 30 urban Indian communities where health services are provided through federal dollars and administration. Um, one result is that we have mental health disparities in the wake of the long history of colonization. There is epidemic levels of distress in many native communities, particularly high prevalence of trauma, violence, substance abuse. Uh, but our mental health services that are offered, either through the union health service directly or by contract from federal sources to tribal governments are really underfunded, and so there remains a really large unmet need. So this is the context in which we want to visit diagnostic issues with American Indians briefly today. The first thing I want to point out are the historical precedence to the diagnostic issues with American Indians that are important just to tap quickly. One, of course, has to do with race science. I have an article here from the 30s, uh, trying to ask the question of whether mixed-blood Indians and full-blood Indians are smarter or less smart than each other, and just like, race science in general, when it came to intelligence testing, you know, people who are more white are smarter, it turns out, or if you're male, you're smarter than women, that's the result of those kinds of tests at that particular time in history. In addition to that kind of work, early work involved culture and personality in an effort to try and get at what is the kind of personality signature of entire tribal cultures. And projective tests featured quite a lot in that, Rorschachs and Draw-A-Persons and thematic perception tests. And of course, there's a long history of acculturation research as well with regard to Indians because of federal interest in managing the Indian Problem, that is, you have all these wards of the government who are, um, using federal resources on reservations, how do we get them moved out into the mainstream economy? In preparation for this, I wanted to undertake a literature review because I haven't really looked at the diagnosis literature in that much detail in recent years, and so 10 days ago I did a PsycINFO search. I used the major concepts that are described in the thesaurus and intersected them together in ways with the preferred term which, now which is "indigenous populations," and the Ns you see are the numbers that were returned. The first number is peer-reviewed materials and the larger number in the back is for all materials including dissertations and chapters. Um, and you can see that there's not tons here. Measurement and indigenous populations netted a pretty good number, but of course, that's much broader than just diagnosis, per say. And, um, Joseph the Elder has talked with some about measurement issues that some of that literature covers. What was interesting to me is that there is important studies that I was aware of that didn't come up at all under these searches, so who knows how these things get categorized. Uh, there's work on MMPI, for example, with Indians that this just did not catch for some unknown reason. But there were a number of domains that I think are just useful to summarize briefly. Um, general overviews of clinical practice came up with a lot of this search, you know, just people, like a psychiatrist working in this system talking about what it's like to work clinically with Indians. Acculturation and well being stuff, uh, has been a long-time interest. The results of that kind of research about whether mental health is, um, acculturation is protective or non-protective, a risk factor for mental health and well being is generally equivocal. It's hard to interpret. Children and school performance or learning disability and gifted and talented was pretty well represented in this literature. A lot on neuropsychological assessment, for whatever reason, having to do with elders and dementia. And then mental health needs assessments from certain Indian health organizations were represented to a pretty good degree as well. I said these are only, like, tangentially relevant to the issues of clinical diagnosis. Maybe the neuropsychological stuff is to a degree, but of course, neurology is sort of different than psychiatry, even though there's funny overlaps. Um, I thought of more direct relevance was these domains here. There's some emerging literature on telepsychiatry because American Indian reservations tend to be in rural parts of the country. There's some interest in establishing to what degree clinical services can be offered through modern technology, and that seems promising. There are also, um, mental health screening measures for substances abuse, depression, which, you know, could be used in various service settings. Psychiatric epidemiology has been probably the most developed form in which mental health stuff is assessed, so the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, or the Composite International Diagnostic Interviews, and so on. Cultural formulation has been done in a few instances with American Indians. This is obviously not the DSM-5 version, because that just came out, but DSM-IV. And then MMPI, as I said, although I put the asterisk here because it didn't really come up in the actual searches that I did. This stuff I think has greater relevance to the kinds of things we're talking about. I think what you wanna take note of, however, is that even though it's better than nothing, there really are quite a few missing domains. Um, there's some stuff on screening, as I said, but not really on screening and referral practices, like what people, how they actually use it in practice, what referrals result. Um, there's not that many diagnostic tests. It'd be nice to have literature on more of those. Um, not too much on clinical interviewing strategies and, you know, communicative norms that structure how people talk with one another and so on. And the cross-cultural equivalence of constructs, which was the kind of stuff that Professor Trimble talked about as well. In all, there's a pretty limited accumulation of knowledge, and that's for several reasons. One is there are a lot of challenges doing American Indian research. Um, it's in rural, isolated settings, small numbers of people, um, few investigative teams seem to be producing this knowledge, so you might have a lot accruing and neuropsychological 'cuz there's maybe three teams that are doing that work on a programatic basis, so something starts to go here. Um, and also, um, there seems to be shifting professional emphasis, as you would expect, with research dollars and funding calling for certain kinds of things rather than other, and epidemiology is one that's really benefited quite a bit from that. So what do you do when there's not a large base and there's not a lot of cumulative knowledge? That's where the fun begins. You get to talk about something that you think is interesting or that you wanna highlight, and that's what I'm gonna do here today. I really wanna talk, uh, through, very briefly, of course, just three exemplars of diagnostic research, and loosely, these are structured from an etic approach of the top to a mixed emic/etic approach with the second project to a more emic approach at the bottom. I'll just run through these and see what we learn from those. The first has to do with diagnosing depression in the American Indian Service Utilization and Psychiatric Epidemiology Risk and Protectors Factors Project, Jan Beals, Spero Manson, and I think you're probably mostly familiar with this. Large-scale psych-epi study for American Indians. It was a replication of the National Comorbidity Survey by Ron Kessler into large reservation populations. You can see that the numbers are quite high here, and they were designed to generalize to the populations. An assessment of nine DSM-III-R disorders including major depressive episode. The diagnostic instruments in this kind of work involved, uh, the University of Michigan version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. That's fully structruredly administered, door-to-door kind of administration. No clinical judgment necessary. And then a clinical reappraisal of about 10% of those cases just for validity check reasons using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM or the SCID. Again, semi-structured. That's clinician-administered. And for this project, I actually was one of the clinical interviewers. Um, I wanted to point, bring this to your attention to it because they grappled with the problem of strikingly low rates of major depressive episode in these, uh, uh, analyses. Basically, the depression rates were coming up at only 30% of what was found in the National Comorbidity Survey for adult Americans, and, um, that flies in the face of what anecdote has been saying about American Indian depression for decades. And so the question put before them was to what degree are these really, um, or artifactually disparate in a positive direction? And it brought to it, of course, a lot of attention then to the diagnostic algorithms that are applied to generate prevalence rates from something like the CD. Um, one of these is the pointer, right? I have this up here so you can just look at using the algorithm of the National Comorbidity Survey, which was the basis for this study, what the depression rates were. Um, you have the Southwest tribe males here at 4.5%. 3.8% for Northern Plains males. 7.9% for, uh, Southwest females. And 5.6% for Northern Plains. So again, really low rates that caused a bit of a dilemma for the researchers to what to make of those. Um, here you have, using the clinical reappraisal, the kappas, using the NCS algorithm, was .27 with a sensitivity of 34%. Um, so not that strong. What they ended up doing in this case then was to try and figure out, well, what could they do using different algorithms, um, to try and figure out how you might walk these prevalence bakes, back to something that seemed a little more realistic. And, um, what they did is they, beyond the NCS algorithm, they were able to determine that, um, some of the way the items were worded created trouble for people to be able to do co-occurance and keep the time frame straight and so on. So they basically dismissed the criterion for co-occurance of the five-plus, the five symptoms of depression and were able using this AI-SUPERPRP Algorithm to show that, you know, the kappa rate could improve and the sensitivity went up, although the specificity dropped just a little bit. And so the question was to what degree, then, is diagnosing depression on different algorithms a better way to account for these data? Here, what we have over here is, um, an attention to, um, what, um, percent increase over the rate, uh, determined with the NCS algorithm if you applied the Indian SUPERPRP Algorithm that did not require co-occurance of the five symptoms. So if you did that for the NCS data here, you can see that it would jump up over 50% more, but it jumped up way higher for these other samples in the Northern Plains and Southwest. So it was a way of trying to correct for what seems like an artifactual problem with how you're assessing depression in this study. And by applying the Indian SUPERPRP Algorithm, you've got, uh, depression rates that are a lot more acceptable, uh, if you think that the standard is the NCS algorithms rather than the very, very low rates. So what was the gist of all this? Uh, the rational then for the alternative algorithm was that it improved diagnostic agreement, the kappa went up a little bit. Although none of these kappas are great. Um, there was greater increase in sensitivity compared to the decrease in specificity, so it seemed to be justified on that front. And there was a decrease in the, in the bias as well. What was our explanation for why they needed to do this to try and get more valid rates? Well, first it had to do with cultural factors. That is, that there are tribal differences in whether dysphoria and anhedonia were endorsed, and if you're not endorsing anhedonia and dysphoria, as you know, you can't get a depression diagnosis. And so the Southwest was much more likely to diagnose than, than the Northern Plains denied those kinds of symptoms. So tribal differences there. And methodological factor was the other issue as well. Co-occurance was difficult for people to keep track of as well as the time frames. So that's one study. Um, the second example I wanted to bring to your attention is one that's, I think, more mixed emic/etic. And this has to do with the Navajo Healing Project by an anthropologist named Tom Csordas and his colleagues. This was basically an ethnographic study of Navajo distress, but one that used SCID diagnoses as a way of trying to anchor and make intelligible, translatable in the terms of psychiatry what was found. And so, um, Csordas and colleagues explored four forms of local therapeutic practice on the Navajo reservation. One had to do with traditional Navajo ceremonies, the second had to do with the Native American church, which is kind of a hybrid of Christian and traditional practices, um, through the peyote ritual, the third is Christian faith healing, along the lines of Pentecostal Christianity, and the fourth, of course, is the biomedicine or the regular kind of mental health work that would be done. And, um, they also were interested in the forms of diagnosis that accompanied these healing traditions that are all evident on the Navajo reservation. So they were interested in how a person or individual represents their own distress, that is, the self, how the healer they were working with would talk about their distress, how the clinician, um, who might be doing a SCID diagnosis would formulate their case, maybe using just the SCID diagnosis as one component of their formulation with broader context, as well as the actual SCID diagnosis as well. And so what's interesting is that all of the people they recruited to this study, they not only did a SCID diagnosis, they not only got a clinician formulation, they followed them and observed them in a healing encounter in one of these different traditions. And we're trying to figure out, and then interviewed healers as well to try to figure out what the healers understood or how they formulated these problems. With regard to the SCID assessment, then, they, uh, out of the 84 people that participated, only 78 were able to complete SCIDs, but you get a sense here for how the distribution of diagnoses went. 18 had no lifetime diagnosis, the rest did. Of those that did, um, you know, uh, the majority of them had comorbid diagnoses at some point in their lives. And what's interesting, of course, is that there's a overlap in services. There was not the case that, you know, most people went only to one traditional, one tradition or the other. People are using multiple things, especially biomedical service as well as some other tradition, sometimes more than one tradition. And the presenting problems were not always psychiatric. So someone would go in with kidney problems or headaches or pain to consult for help, um, even though they did have a lifetime history and sometimes current psychiatric distress as well. In fact, nearly half of them went for stuff, though, for help that was not obviously psychiatric. So what they did is in this article, um, which you might take a look at if you're interested further is they, you know, kind of did some case study stuff here. Here we have, um, you know, an 18-year-old woman who's following traditional Navajo ways. here you have a 69-year-old man who's following, um, I guess that's traditional Navajo, and that's Native American church, and then a 22-year-old man who's following, um, Christian, you know, evangelical or fundamentalist Christian faith healing. And so for example, this 22-year-old man, what you have is that he was having a lot of grief after the loss of his father. His father kind of died maybe from complications of alcoholism. He was young, unmarried member of the family who took over all the responsibilities for the family. So you can see here in this column you've got the patient's description of the illness, "grief after father's death, sleepless, suicidal thoughts," so the suicidal stuff seems that it could really well shade into something pathological. Um, the SCID diagnosis of PTSD, present, past month. And this is the interview of formulation that of course involved the SCID but went more beyond that, and this interview, clinician felt like major depressive disorder features were really characteristic of this grief. And the Christian minister said it was grief. And the intervention that they followed happened to be prayer for grief. And I think the minister at first thought that maybe the prayer wouldn't be too helpful because he questioned this man's commitment to the Christian faith. He was not sure whether he was following through to the degree he needed to, but he was glad to hear, of course, that, um, the faith seemed to help him in some way. So take-home lessons from this particular project, um, uh, uh, Csordas and colleagues said that healers do assist patients with psychiatric distress, even if that's not always the presenting problem. And of course, people who have more things wrong with them are more likely to end up seeking traditional healing for whatever reason it is they do so. Healing traditions differ in big degree, the distinction between mind and body, mental health, physical health, and so on. Obviously, traditional Navajo and Native American church are not making that big a distinction in that way. Healing traditions differ in psychological versus spiritual explanations for distress. That probably seems obvious. Um, and they go on to say that, you know, this kind of work, this kind of ethnographic work, is important because it talks about the ways in which you need to address the existential totality of a patient experience. You know, just a diagnosis is not enough. It's too decontextualized, it's not gonna help you necessarily be effective with someone. That DSM disorders really are useful for comparative purposes and these researchers and anthropologists saying that you really ought to be doing a SCID so that you have something to say to the broader accumulation of knowledge, but not necessarily privileging those, um, that you can get other stuff too. Um, and that, you know, therapeutic systems, um, can be in a range of relationships from conflicting, that is, that you couldn't be in both 'cuz they really see each other as antagonistic in some way, to completely non-overlapping, they're just serving completely different segments of a population, versus other ways of them either being complementary or coordinated. Um, finally, they say there's certain benefits to studying the DSM, vis a vis local diagnostic categories. One reason you would do this is just to be able to portray a diagnostic portrait of a community. A second reason would be to be able to do comparative prevalence between communities in the way the SUPERPRP folks did between those Northern Plains and the Southwest. A third, by people who trace the ontological malleability of disorders, the way in which distress and disorder are configured culturally in local terms in ways that change or are different. And finally, the existential totality of distress becomes an important part of that equation as well. Last study, then, is more of an emic project, I would say. It has to do with what's called American Indian historical trauma. American Indian historical trauma is, I think of it mainly as a folk discourse but one in which there are a good number of clinicians and clinician researchers who are interested in making it more than a folk discourse. We're interested in making it a clinical tool in some way. As Whitbeck and colleagues review in this article, it follows from the Holocaust model of intergenerational trauma. Briefly, the Holocaust, uh, model has to do with the second generation, uh, the kids or offspring of Holocaust survivors are said to be greater at risk for psychological problems as a result of their parents having survived the Holocaust. So historical trauma then becomes a form, I said alternative, uh-huh, form of distress. Um, we're left with some attributes of historical trauma that are important to note here. First and foremost, it's a health discourse or a mental health discourse. Second, I think it's elaboration of post-traumatic stress disorder. It takes the diagnostic concept as a starting point but then moves more broadly. It posits that the original cause is massive historical oppression. And finally, it says that, uh, this repression, oppression results in collective, cumulative, and intergenerational transmission for psychiatric problems. So Whitbeck and colleagues sought out to try and measure this, create an instrument that would help. They created two components based on the historical trauma construct. First is to try and measure the ever-present losses, historical losses associated with colonization and oppression that are currently in people's minds, and the second was to trace symptoms, emotional symptoms that might be associated with those kinds of cognitions. So they created focus groups with elders, they asked a lot of questions, they started to sketch out these scales, they gave them back to the elders, and then piloted them in some of their large-scale epi work that they're doing. So we have just a table of the perceived losses. You've got the 12 items of such losses here. These are cognitions about historical losses that people could endorse as having had on a daily basis or more rarely than that. You can see the percentages there. Something that's interesting like the loss of families from reservation government relocation was almost never thought of by half the folks. Loss of family ties 'cuz of boarding schools, not too many people thought about that. But other things were thought of a lot more strongly. And here you have, um, the items, the actual distress they said was associated with their having those thoughts of losses. So if they, the question was "How do you feel when you think about these losses?" and then they could report, you know, these particular kinds of, uh, emotional symptoms and how often, always, so on. Um, you take all this and you put it together, they did factor analysis and then the structural equation model to try and map out what the relationship is here. And so you get, you know, the latent constructs of perceived loss, obviously including anxiety, depression component, or anger and avoidance component. Everything's significant and the coefficients, um, are, you know, sort of as projected in the direction you would expect. So what is the promise, then, of this measure of American historical trauma? Uh, Whitbeck and them claimed that it helps us to ascertain the presence of historical trauma, uh, which would be important since it's talked about as being everywhere in American Indian communities. It could help to link thoughts and symptoms empirically. Um, it can assess these, uh, experiences relative to functioning. He says that in this article with this measure he hasn't done that yet. You would have to take this and see to what degree it correlates or is associated with psychiatric distress or disability, dysfunction in some way. Um, and of course, you can explore patterns across tribal groups. Maybe it's the case that some tribal groups have more or less of this. The theory's not really that well worked out, but you would, you might expect differences between descendents of peoples who were colonized 400 years ago versus those that were colonized 100 years ago. Um, but that is usually not theorized very well. Finally, I think there are some limitations to appreciate with this measure. Um, first of all, it's based on retrospective self-report. So I get a survey, I see how, I say retrospectively how I've thought about these things, and then I'm asked, well, what did I feel when I thought them. It's starting to get pretty far removed from the actual thought and the actual experience, although it'd be hard to imagine how you could prospectively do this, um, if it's not something that's happening all the time. Um, and it's increasingly confounded with cultural identity. I think one of the things is if you start to, in this day and age, because historical trauma is so prevalent a folk discourse, if you simply prime American Indian cultural identity in your work, you could then ask "Are you historically traumatized," the people as a function of just their cultural identity might be more likely to say yes without it being necessarily empirically anchored to everyday real life experiences. And finally, this work is completely irrelevant, I think, for establishing intergenerational causality. Um, it's all about, you know, in a given life course now. It doesn't tell you that something happened to the ancestors is why you're feeling that way. You can think of it maybe as a form of post hoc meaning making, even. And that's what I was asked to share, so thank you for your attention, and I don't know how much time we have for questions, but you'll let us know, Zorni.
