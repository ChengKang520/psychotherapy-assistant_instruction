THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome, I am Jeffrey Mishlove. Today, we are going to be discussing Cultivation of Mindfulness. With me is Dr. Charles Tart, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis. Dr. Tart is the author of numerous books including, Awaking Up, States of Consciousness, Transpersonal Psychologies, Altered States of Consciousness and Size, studies in the scientific realm. Welcome Charley. 

00:00:55
CHARLES T. TART Good evening Jeffrey. 

00:00:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Pleasure to have you here. When we think of the problems of modern life, everything from ecology to our social and political problems, to our economic and military problems, it… it strikes me that one might be able to say that, lack of mindfulness or mindlessness might… might be the root cause of… of virtually all of these conditions. 

00:01:20
CHARLES T. TART PhD Psychologist University of California, Davis I think that’s an excellent way of thinking about it. It’s as if we are dreaming. But you know when we dream at night there is a wonderful safety system that cuts in, there is a part of the brain that actually paralysis us so we can’t talk, we can’t act and so forth, so we can have these fantasies being out of touch with reality, but there is no consequences. But in our everyday life, we can be very mindless of what’s going on around us and caught up in our daydreams and projections and hopes and fears and act on them, and that’s where the problem comes, when we act out our fantasies. 

00:01:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s as if I… I would think that everybody as sort of living out a… a certain mythology that… that the fundamental premises upon which all our actions are based are ultimately somehow mythological. We… We have so many things we assume. 

00:02:05
CHARLES T. TART Yes, each of us is walking around lost in our personal myth and that interacts with our cultural myth and that interacts with our world myth and so many times we don’t perceive the way things actually are as a result. I mean, the East had this idea long before. We did when they talked about living in Maya or Samsara, some kind of state of illusion. It's not that the world isn’t real, it's that we're so immersed in our daydreams and hopes and fears that we distort our perception that we're… we walk about in an illusion, and that gets us into trouble. 

00:02:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The irony of it seems to me that, when we try to be rational, when we try to think about the problem is… is when we get ourselves in… into the greatest trouble. 

00:02:50
CHARLES T. TART Thinking won't solve it. See, the problem is not just that we're not thinking right, that’s… that's part of it, but the problem is more that we're not perceiving correctly, that in a sense our runaway thoughts, automating kind of thoughts are taking over our perceptions and distorting those. Now, intellectual analysis of that is fine as a starting place, but then you've actually got to learn the skill of being present to what's actually going on at that moment, of seeing and hearing and tasting those things the way they actually are. 

00:03:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words getting in touch with raw experience underneath the sort of cognitive cerebral layer of… of the way we think about us. 

00:03:35
CHARLES T. TART Right! Living in the here and now. This is especially important in our interactions with other people. I mean, so many times two people are interacting, we could be interacting for instance, and I have my myth of who I am and you have a certain role in my mythology and you have your myth of who I am and I have a minor role in that and each of us is lost in our myth and not really noticing what the other person is feeling, saying, communicating and so forth. Naturally, that’s gonna make for a funny kind of relationship and yet I am afraid psychological studies have shown that this is almost the norm that's extremely common for people to be lost in their projections when they think they would be relating to how the other people are. 

00:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it would seemed to me that at some level there is no getting out of it. We all have a concept of, I suppose what it means to be human and it would seem to me that ultimately we don’t know, nobody really knows. 

00:04:30
CHARLES T. TART Well, but if you reach that kind of intellectual conclusion that nobody really knows, that’s liable to stop you from trying. I'd much rather say that, I don’t know what the limits are on really being able to be present and realistic except they’re an awfully lot better than what we normally do. So let's not worry about ultimate limits, let's get on with becoming mindful. It reminds me of a story that's attributed to the Buddha, that a man was once shot with a poisoned arrow and another chap comes along and says, "here I'll pull it out." And the wounded man says, "wait a minute, there… there are some important things we have to figure out first like, who shot this arrow? And what was his motivation? And who provided him with the poison? And why is there a society that allows things like this can happen?" Meantime the poison is spreading, alright. So, yes, it's interesting to think about the wise and the ultimate possibilities and all that, but we really need to get to work on coming to our senses and finding out what’s actually going on now and let the ultimate questions wait. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And when you say coming to our senses, I gather you mean that in a literal way. 

00:05:35
CHARLES T. TART I mean it in a very literal way. Most of the time, we're not with our senses. Most of the time, we put a small percentage of our tension on what our sense is actually perceived and that’s immediately abstracted into thoughts and concepts and beliefs and prejudices and those are the things we're aware of. I may walk down the street for instance and there is a rose bush and after a fraction of a second of actually seeing at the concept Rose, beautiful flower, nice smell, dominates my mind. I mechanically bend over, sniff it, but I'm not really paying attention to that actually. Rose - I'm in my concepts about it and that’s actually a very non-nourishing experience compared to what would happen if I actually notice that this thing and sniffed it and notice the colors. 

00:06:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah, I suppose I could distract you by asking, why it is that we can’t or we don’t normally just really intensely have the experience, essential experience of a rose? Why… Why is it that the concept sort of pops up in our mind like that? 

00:06:45
CHARLES T. TART Ah! It's because abstraction is very useful. We live in a complicated world where a lot of times we can't handle all the sensory data in all its rich detail. We've got other goals. We have to hurry toward it. There is nothing wrong with abstraction. 

00:07:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay! 

00:07:00
CHARLES T. TART What’s wrong with it is that it becomes automatic and it starts running all the time and we have no choice about it. 

00:07:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words from a psychological perspective, our problem is that we are intermittently reinforced for using abstract thoughts. 

00:07:15
CHARLES T. TART That’s right. That’s a good way to put it and so we get into the habit. In fact, it goes further than that. We automatically create thoughts in distorted perceptions that are satisfying to us and we get a kind of satisfaction out of that and that withdraws us from the reality of the world, which it seems good in some way. You withdraw from some of the pain in the world by not noticing it, because you are too busy in your own thoughts. The trouble is that in the long run you pay an extremely high price for that kind of withdrawal, that kind of substituting your daydream for a perception, because you do stupid things in the world, you generate coma in an Eastern sense, you act maladaptively. If we're having a conversation for instance and I am wrapped up in my personal mythology in my beliefs about you and don’t notice your actuality at the time, at some level you know that and resent it, I act in ways that are not appropriate to what you're really thinking and feeling and you're gonna get back at me in some sense. Or I'm just going to things that are stupid and don't fit among the situation and we end up with more suffering, which of course tempts us to make our projections work even harder, so we don’t notice that pain, but it’s a… it's a vicious spiral. 

00:08:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE , PhD When you seemed to be telling the story of modern culture in many ways, certainly if we look at literature and at theatre, this… this kind of failure of people to really encounter each other is… is a major theme of… of modern existence. 

00:08:40
CHARLES T. TART I don’t know that it's all limited to modern culture but I'll say this for modern culture, it may be against modern culture. Once you're into distracting yourself from reality, we have more technological tools for doing it than any other cultures ever had. You can sit in front of the tube all day, you can get your doctor prescribe you tranquilizers and drugs that will cut you off from reality, you can buy illegal drugs, the diversions available to just prime the fantasies you want to go are innumerable today. 

00:09:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE At the same time it would seem to me that, because of communication we have access to technologies from… from many, many cultures throughout the world that have been developed to overcome this issue. 

00:09:25
CHARLES T. TART That’s right, and this is really interesting. We have what we might call mindfulness techniques from all over the planet. Techniques that are designed to make you more aware of what you're actually doing, perceiving, feeling at this very instant. And that’s what I think it's interesting to talk about, because we have these things that have come in from other cultures and we now have to start to adapt them to our culture. I mean, it's fine to realize that we're not there much of the time. And what usually happens is you figure that out a year later, you know. I was having this conversation with someone and I suddenly realize that was such a stupid thing I said, I wasn’t aware of all what was going on. Well, a year later is pretty late, it may be too late to do anything about it now, may be you can get to do it a week later or five minutes later. But what you really wanna do is be aware of right in the moment of what you're doing and if it's inappropriate stop it. And this is where mindfulness techniques come in very helpfully. Now, I've been very involved in learning what for me is a new kind of mindfulness technique in the past couple of years and that sort of classical meditation techniques. And I call them classical in the sense that these techniques generally recommend that you sit down in a quiet place, where you're not gonna be interrupted. So a lot of the things you have to deal with is part of everyday… everyday life are not there. The phone is not gonna ring, nobody is gonna ask you something, and now you start looking at the way your mind operates. And this is horrible in a sense, because what so many of us discover is that our mind is out of control. 

00:11:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s racing, racing, racing all the while. 

00:11:05
CHARLES T. TART Yes, I say, well I am going to sit there and be calm say and just be aware of the sensations in my body as my exercise for the day and my mind says, "hey, that’s a good idea! I could write a paper about that and let's see what’s the most interesting since…" No, wait a minute, I wanted to sit here and be aware of what actual sensations are and so you discover that your thoughts race. But eventually with practice, you learn to not be carried away on racing thoughts and fantasies and dreams and begin to develop a certain kind of mindfulness of what you feel like, what your body feel like, what your senses are bringing in at a particular time and that’s very rewarding. I'm just beginning to taste that to a fair degree. And it's… it's rewarding in and of itself to in a sense just be instead of producing and thinking and all that and it also leads to very interesting insights that can be useful in everyday life. 

00:12:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, when you talk about classical meditation, what… what do you have in mind? 

00:12:05
CHARLES T. TART Well, let’s take Buddhist Vipassana, Insight Meditation is an excellent example of that and you have variations of this all around the world, where you're told to sit and take a sort of witness consciousness to what’s going on. Can you just observe your mind and your senses and so forth, they are trying to change anything? 

00:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:12:25
CHARLES T. TART And you learn a lot from that. You learn for instance how hard it is not to change things. You learn for instance you have preferences. Well, this sensation in my body, that doesn’t strike me as special or spiritual, I have been had a spiritual experience kind of thing. Now, you said you are there to observe whatever happens, so you learn a lot about the biases you have that affect your life and so forth. But there is a problem I found with this and I've noticed it in other people who are doing these sort of classical-sit down in a quiet place kind of meditations. And that is that, you don’t live there. I… I mean it's nice to sit still in a quiet place once you are up, but most of your life is spend out where people talk to you, and the phone rings, and events happen, and it's very hard to maintain mindfulness in those kind of situations. 

00:13:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I recall recently a story of a man who studied for nine years in a Buddhist monastery and mastered this kind of meditation and then left the monastery and immediately went out into the world, got married and had a horrible marriage, and… and he remarked about this, that his experience as a mediator did not prepare him at all for, you know, dealing with real world issues. 

00:13:35
CHARLES T. TART That’s right! See one of the problems in adapting the eastern techniques to our culture is that they are very monastic-oriented techniques in a lot of ways. You know, now for a monk, sitting in a quiet place, meditating, that is real life for much of him or her if she is a nun, you know, or a slow walking meditation that is the kind of thing that’s the part of life. But I don’t think this kind of monastic tradition is gonna take a very strong root in our culture from those of the people. We need a sort of mindfulness that can be carried into our everyday life, you know. Can I be mindful when I am talking here with TV cameras on me, not just what I am sitting in a quiet room by myself? 

00:14:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or hooked up to by a feedback? 

00:14:15
CHARLES T. TART That’s right! 

00:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Well, are there such skills or are there other traditions in this direction? 

00:14:25
CHARLES T. TART No! This is the thing that I talked a lot about in my awaking up book recently, drawing especially on Gurdjieff's kind of teachings about developing a sort of mindfulness in everyday life. 

00:14:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose athletic training might be another example of that? 

00:14:35
CHARLES T. TART Yes, that tends to be a specialized kind of mindfulness though, you know, learn how to move your body in a certain optimal way. And actually almost any kind of skill training you can see a specialized mindfulness training. You learn… 

00:14:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Musical training? 

00:14:50
CHARLES T. TART Musical training! Although it eventually becomes automated again, when you get skill down real good it all becomes automatic and you lose the mindfulness of it, which can be an advantage in some ways, because slowly your habits might move faster than your conscious awareness. But then if you need to change, it could be a real block when something gets automated. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:15:10
CHARLES T. TART So, Gurdjieff's idea was more a matter of learning to develop a simultaneous kind of witnessing consciousness as part of your everyday life. While you wash the dishes, while you open the door, while you talk to someone, while you went to the bathroom, in all kinds of everyday things. 

00:15:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, let’s just stop for a second and reflect for a moment. Who is Gurdjieff? 

00:15:35
CHARLES T. TART Ah! Who was Gurdjieff? Gurdjieff was one of the first people who tried to adapt eastern ideas about mindfulness to Western culture. You know, he worked beginning around the turn of the century, died in the 1940's and there are still many groups that operate on his principles of learning to be mindful is part of everyday life, you know. There is a very complex philosophy that goes along with it also, but the thing 'distress' is that he told people you are walking around in a awaking daydream, a dangerous daydream because you can sign checks even though you are not really aware of what you're doing. 

00:16:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:16:10
CHARLES T. TART And so his training was to teach people to become aware of what’s happening at this very moment. How does your body feel? What are your emotions doing? What are you perceiving? What’s your position in this situation? And it’s a very useful skill. 

00:16:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, let… if… Let’s suppose you were to ask me who I am? I might have a sort of an automatic answer. 

00:16:35
CHARLES T. TART Right! 

00:16:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I might say, "oh, I am just fine", as… as people normally do in our culture. How are you? Fine! And mindfulness would be to stop that process and try to get underneath it somehow. 

00:16:45
CHARLES T. TART Now, suppose I ask you mindfully now, who are you? And I ask you to reply mindfully. 

00:16:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah… 

00:16:55
CHARLES T. TART The automatic… The automatic machineries shutters to a halt. 

00:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It was… You know, it was a little funny. 

00:16:55
CHARLES T. TART It's wonderful! 

00:17:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:17:00
CHARLES T. TART Yes, but I'm asking you to be mindful right at this moment. 

00:17:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Who am I? I don’t know that I have a name when I'm really being mindful. Any name has… has so much baggage associated with it. 

00:17:10
CHARLES T. TART That’s wonderful! You touched into it, your true identity for a moment and then you got into a very clever thought that took you away from the mindfulness again. That’s wonderful! 

00:17:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! Well I did (crosstalk)(inaudible)… 

00:17:25
CHARLES T. TART (crosstalk)(inaudible) demonstration here. 

00:17:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I was gonna say who am I? I'm me! I don’t know if that's an automatic one or… or not. 

00:17:30
CHARLES T. TART But see I think you had a taste for a moment of that mental machinery stopping. 

00:17:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:17:35
CHARLES T. TART And there is a whole universe that can open up when you stop that, okay. Some meditation techniques try to forcefully stop the mental machinery like that with a sudden shock, a sudden change of conditions and you're left without your automatic games, your habits, your filters for a moment and you are just there, back to something much more basic, that’s behind all the other stuff anyway. You know, the Gurdjieff's work tries to do that in ordinary life. The meditative traditions do it in a special, quiet setting. My experience has been that cultivating mindfulness in everyday life is very useful and you learn a lot about yourself, but you don’t learn too much about really deep fundamental aspects of yourself, because you're too busy, right? In everyday life there is a lot of stuff coming and grabbing our attention. You can learn immense amounts about it, okay. The meditative traditions on the other hand, you've eliminated all that heavy outside stimulation so you see many of the more subtle things about yourself. What I'm interested in now is not only learning the meditative practices better myself, because they're very interesting and there is a lots psychology needs to know about them, but I'm starting to bridge the gap. How do you go from the meditative state to everyday life to everyday life to the meditative state, maintaining mindfulness over a wide variety of conditions? 

00:19:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It strikes me as I, you know, reflect on the experience I just had with you that I… I get in touch with a lot of vulnerability here that, really becoming mindful means letting go off a… off a lot of things that I associate with my adult self and… and becoming child like in some ways, and that’s a bit frightening. 

00:19:25
CHARLES T. TART One of the things that happen to all of us to some degree as children was that our true selves were attacked, invalidated, denied and we created a persona. We created a false personality, to use Gurdjieff's wonderful term for it, to protect ourselves and that was somewhat conscious act to begin with, but it all became automatic. Now to take that off, yeah, I mean, we're just here in reality and some of that reality is a small child that hasn’t grownup yet, that feels vulnerable. So you have to be kind to yourself in this process. You don’t show that vulnerability in a situation where you might really get hurt for instance. Part of being mindful is to be mindful of what’s possible in this given situation. 

00:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose to be mindful in a way that there is this baggage, it's… it's part of me in some way, I've acquired it and if I need to use it, if it's appropriate in a situation, to use it, to be assertive. 

00:20:25
CHARLES T. TART The point of Gurdjieff's work in a sense and I can see this is the point of some of the classical meditation things is to develop a new center of the self that is not your ordinary ego at all, it’s a center that has infinite possibilities, that doesn’t identify with anything, it's very aware and that can use all the ordinary aspects of your personality as tools when they're appropriate, but then put them down when they are not appropriate. But ordinarily, our false personality is just run on automatic, they don’t stop. We identify with them, we fight to save them, you know, anything to protect my precious self kind of thing. The mindfulness traditions invite us to take chances on dropping that. 

00:21:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:21:15
CHARLES T. TART Fortunately, you get a fair amount of very positive experiences as a reward for doing that, but there are certainly moments when it’s frightening. 

00:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We cling so much to our egos and often identify with them. I… I guess if we… if I think of the ego, I think of the part of me that considers myself to be separate from you and separate from everything else. 

00:21:35
CHARLES T. TART That’s right! 

00:21:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That’s the part that you're talking about, letting go off. 

00:21:40
CHARLES T. TART Separate and defended, our egos act like armor in a way, you know. I was hurt once upon a time by somebody outside myself so I am going to close myself off, I have built a wall of skills and anecdotes and verbal plays and personality characteristics around me to protect that vulnerability. But of course we're not tiny children anymore. We're not that much at the mercy of other people. We can begin to let those defenses down in our own minds and look at the world in a more open-minded way. 

00:22:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You used an interesting term earlier, you talked about the center of the self, developing a new center of the self which is not the ego. 

00:22:25
CHARLES T. TART Yes, and I felt very ambivalent about using that, because even using the word center kind of thingifies it, makes it little too concrete. Let's say with mindfulness training, you develop a shift toward process. It's… It's hard to say this in… in any kind of specific language, but instead of, "this thing is the precious me", it's more you flow with all sorts of things rather than there'll be some hard, little, unchangeable thing that you have to hold on to. 

00:22:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One becomes the dance rather than the dancer? 

00:22:55
CHARLES T. TART Yes! One moves from dancer to dancer. One is the dance, one moves to the other situations. It's a… It’s a great flexibility and of course that leads to great creativity in life, great flexibility in dealing with things. 

00:23:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, in cultivating this different sensibility, are there processes or… or is it just a question of, one cultivates mindfulness by being mindful? 

00:23:30
CHARLES T. TART Yes, but there are skill beings that can really be helpful. So, you know, working with people who are more mindful, who can remind you when you've lost it for instance can be really helpful or having miniature versions of it with little more specific, you know. Like you can tell people just be mindful and that’s great, but it's kind of vague in the abstract. So many be you tell people, be aware of every… or let's say, every time you come to a door today open it with the opposite hand than you usually do. You are bringing some deliberate mindfulness into a very specific situation that people can work with. 

00:24:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In… In other words breaking habits? 

00:24:05
CHARLES T. TART Breaking habits, going against the flow, not that it’s not necessary to break the habit but the effort recalled to be mindful and do it differently helps to create the kind of mindfulness that you need. 

00:24:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It seems to me that one of the traps that we fall into is… is that we have habits and they may be perfectly good habits but we don’t even know that we have them. 

00:24:25
CHARLES T. TART That’s right. This is where meditation and mindfulness practice are very revealing, because you discover these things, so you try to be mindful, you know, I'm gonna open doors with… for me my left hand today and I realize at the end of the day I didn’t remember once to open the door with my left hand. Well, I've learned a number of things. I've got a real strong habit with my right hand on doors and I have very little capacity to be mindful even though I said I was going to be. Learning that is a great step, right? That might motivate you to do it a little bit harder. But sure there are lots of specific techniques in… in total and mindfulness, you know, the kind of things and the awaking up book that I talk about too, work for this the kind of classical meditative procedures to meditate in specific ways. They're skillful means to go at mindfulness. 

00:25:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Often in our culture we hear the term consciousness raising. We just have a few moments Charlie, but I… I wonder how would you distinguish between consciousness raising or consciousness and mindfulness? 

00:25:30
CHARLES T. TART I wish we didn’t have consciousness raising. What that usually means in practice is when I get you to agree with my point of view your consciousness has been raised. It's… It's… It's become politicized, okay. When I am talking about something that goes beyond excepting or rejecting a particular view point, I'm talking about being present to who you are now, being present to the world you are in and your position in it, your feelings in it, and so having far more freedom of action and actually make decisions as to what’s best instead of just being swept along by habit and may be reaching toward what the classical traditions call enlightenment or awakening, where you really begin to discover more about your true nature instead of always just being swept downstream by your mental and emotional habits. 

00:26:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And you seemed to be suggesting that this quality of mindfulness or presence is… is almost independent of what political or religious or scientific beliefs you might have on a… on a certain topic. 

00:26:25
CHARLES T. TART Well, let me put it this way, what’s the best form of government in an insane asylum? Should it be democracy, socialism or monarchy? We know that’s silly. If the people are insane, whatever form they use they're gonna really mess things up. What you need in insane asylum is to bring people to sanity. Most of our social forms would work excellently if you had people who are awake to the present moment in them instead of people who are just conditioned around with habit. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, Charlie Tart it’s been a pleasure having you with me, and it’s a very valuable service that you're performing by introducing such a fundamental concept as mindfulness into the world of psychology and into our society. 

00:27:10
CHARLES T. TART And I think we can end by asking everyone to take a moment to reflect on who am I? 

00:27:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Charlie, thank you very much for being with me. 

00:27:15
CHARLES T. TART My pleasure Jeffrey. 

00:27:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you very much for being with us.
