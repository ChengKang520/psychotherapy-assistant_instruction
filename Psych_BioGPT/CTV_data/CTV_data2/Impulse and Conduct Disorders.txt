IMPULSE AND CONDUCT DISOREDERS 

00:00:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Because children are discovering the world and don't have much experience, they tend to act on their impulses. Due to the lack of verbal skills to express themselves, they may yell, hit and take things they want without much thought until they begin to mature. Through a variety of factors, some nature, some nurture, many children learn to better manage these impulsive emotions and behaviors, so that they can reflect on their actions to become more caring, considerate members of society. However, some children may grow into adolescents and adults who are unable to control their emotions and behaviors. They may break rules, lie, steal, or physically harm other people, regardless if they recognize that these things are disruptive to others lives and their own. Individuals exhibiting these behaviors maybe suffering from one of the impulse and conduct disorders also known as Disruptive Impulse Control and Conduct Disorders, a grouping of disorders codified and defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5. Individuals with these disorders share a common difficulty in resisting impulses.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder 

00:01:40
OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER SPECIFIERS 

00:01:40
SEAN HARRIGAN The Impulse and Conduct Disorders grouping contains a number of distinct disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. These codes crosswalk to the codes used by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is linked to the coding system from ICD-9 with codes from ICD-10 listed in parentheses. For example, Oppositional Defiant Disorder is assigned the code 313.81 from ICD-9 and F91.3 in parentheses from ICD 10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was released in the fall of 2015 in the United States, although it was adopted previously in other countries. However, because ICD-10 is now the standard in the United States, this program will be listing the newer code from ICD-10 first, followed by the ICD-9 code in parentheses. Sometimes when relevant, we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes when we mention a disorder from one of the other chapters of DSM-5. For example, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, a depressive disorder mentioned later in this program, is coded as F34.8, (296.99) part of the F30-F39 section of ICD-10 on Mood Affective Disorders. About half of the disorders in this chapter are included in the ICD-10 F63 section on Habit and Impulse Disorders. This section also includes Pathological Gambling and Trichotillomania alongside Pyromania and Kleptomania. This underlies the impulsive nature of these particular disorders. The other half are included in F91 Conduct Disorders. Interestingly, F91 also includes a different code for conduct disorder confined to the family context, a distinction not made in DSM-5. This is important because it highlights the fact that conduct disorder often begins in the family context. When these episodes start to occur outside the home, it may speak to a heightening of the disorder, which then has a separate code in ICD-10. Oppositional Defiant Disorder is characterized by persistently disobedient, defiant, and provocative behavior with the absence of dissocial or aggressive acts that violate others. It is usually seen in children below the age of 9 to 10 years old, and may include the following symptoms. The individual may frequently experience loss of temper and feelings of anger, irritability, resentment or annoyance. These individuals may initiate confrontations out of spite or vindictiveness. As many of the symptoms from these categories may be brought out by normal sibling interactions these symptoms must be observed in the individual's interactions with at least one person who is not a sibling. Individuals may also exhibit repeated instances of defying requests from authority figures, frequent arguing with those in a position of authority, accusing others of their own mistakes or difficulties and deliberate annoyance of others. These behavioral issues cause the individual significant distress in important areas of functioning, whether social, professional or otherwise. Often these individuals do not consider themselves to be antagonistic, irritable or defiant, but rather blame this behavior on others or on their circumstances. Additionally, Oppositional Defiant Disorder should not be diagnosed if the individual is already experiencing a bipolar, psychotic, depressive, or addictive or substance disorder. Age must be taken into consideration when diagnosing this disorder as certain behavioral characteristics are appropriate in childhood and adolescence with symptoms subsequently remitting. When diagnosing children, it is also helpful to consider the possibility of hostile parenting, which may in turn lead to these kinds of behaviors. However, it should be noted that these behaviors may also lead to hostile parenting. So it is up to the clinician to sift through the information provided to develop an accurate diagnosis by taking careful notes of the patient's background and history. Those with Oppositional Defiant Disorder may later develop conduct disorder, which has similar behavioral symptoms, but includes more severe behavior such as aggression toward people and animals, as well as violating others' rights. We will explore this disorder more, later in this program. Clinicians may specify the severity of the disorder, depending on the prevalence of behaviors across multiple settings, such as work, home or school. If symptoms are confined to 1 setting, this indicates mild. 2, moderate, and 3 or more, severe. 

00:07:05
INTERMITTENT EXPLOSIVE DISORDER 

00:07:10
SEAN HARRIGAN In individuals over than 6, Intermittent Explosive Disorder is characterized by aggressive outbursts that demonstrate an inability to control impulses. The aggressiveness that these individuals display is excessive, considering the events preceding the outburst and is not planned or advantageous. These outbursts include either relatively infrequent three times in a year instances of outburst that cause damage or injury to property, animals or other people or more frequent instances of aggression, which do not cause the same type of damage or harm. The consequences of these events may include legal or monetary hardship as well as significant distress or impairment in functioning. These outbursts are not due to the effects of the substance such as cocaine, hallucinogens, or a medication or due to another disorder such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or major depressive disorder, a psychotic disorder, certain personality disorders or other medical conditions that may cause difficulty controlling aggressive outbursts. Additionally, for adolescents aged 6 to 18, clinicians must rule out aggressive behavior that is associated with the current diagnosis of adjustment disorder. Individuals rarely develop intermittent explosive disorder later than age 40. The behavior characteristics, of the disorder has often been present for many years. 

00:08:45
CONDUCT DISORDER 

00:08:50
SEAN HARRIGAN Conduct disorder is a pattern of behavior that involves the violation of societal rules or norms, or the violation of others basic rights. DSM-5 groups the symptoms by type of behavior. However, the symptoms used for diagnosis may be from any category. So we will be listing them individually. Possible characteristics include physical cruelty towards people or animals, starting physical fights, using a weapon such as a knife, bat or gun, bullying others, setting fires in order to cause serious damage, stealing while confronting a victim, truancy, temper tantrums, destroying other people's property without fire, sexually abusing another person, staying out past a parental curfew beginning before age 13, breaking and entering, theft including forgery, running away from home, skipping school beginning before age 13, lying or conning others in order to gain goods or favors, or to avoid duties. 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Hey, Harry (ph), I found this in your room. 

00:10:00
HARRY Okay. 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN Where did this come from? 

00:10:05
HARRY From the video store. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. I know it came from the video store. But how did you buy it? 

00:10:10
HARRY With money. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN What money? 

00:10:10
HARRY The allowance you gave me. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN That money isn't enough to get you this kind of thing. 

00:10:15
HARRY I saved it up. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Did you steal this? 

00:10:20
HARRY May be. 

00:10:25
SEAN HARRIGAN In addition to a portion of the above symptoms, the behavior causes significant impairment in the individual's life. If the individual is older than 18, the clinician must ensure that the individual does not have antisocial personality disorder. 

00:10:40
CONDUCT DISORDER SPECIFIERS 

00:10:45
SEAN HARRIGAN When coding Conduct Disorder, the clinician must indicate when the disorder began. Childhood-onset type indicates that the patient showed at least one characteristic prior to age 10. Adolescent-onset type is for those patients who did not show any issues with conduct prior to age 10. If the clinician does not have enough information to determine the age of onset, then unspecified onset may be used. Additionally, if the patient displays certain symptoms, the clinician may specify with limited prosocial emotions. This specifier requires that the patient displayed two of four characteristics repeatedly over the course of a year and in multiple areas of their life. Rather than a rare event, these characteristics must be confirmed as a pattern by both the patient's self-report and reports from other individuals who have known the patient for significant period of time. The four characteristics associated with this specifier include apathy about personal performance at home, work or school, limited affect, absence of remorse and lack of empathy. Additionally, the clinician may specify the severity of the disorder. This ranges from mild cases in which the patients conduct problems only cause minor harm to others to moderate where the number of conduct problems and its effect are intermediate between mild and those in severe. Lastly, to severe cases in which the patient's conduct problems significantly harm other people or the patient displays far more than three characteristics. 

00:12:25
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER 

00:12:30
SEAN HARRIGAN While the social personality disorder is, as the name suggests, a personality disorder, its significant features of acting outside of the social construct warrant dual coding in both this chapter and the chapter on personality disorders. The social personality disorder may be more recognizable by one of its other names: sociopathy, psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder. This disorder includes a pattern of inconsideration of others' rights and in fact, can even go beyond this, so that the individual performs actions that actively violate others' rights. These individuals may have a history of illegal actions and duplicity and may get into fights because of excessive antagonism toward others. They may have little trouble forming relationships, but difficulty maintaining them. They may ignore their own safety or the safety of others. This can include erratic driving, harmful substance use, or sexual behavior, or child endangerment. A pattern of not meeting behavioral expectations at work, or not paying one's bills are also possible symptoms. Some may have a lack of guilt for having hurt another person in any way. Experiencing conduct disorder in adolescents may precede the onset of this disorder. This personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the patient is already been diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. 

00:14:05
PYROMANIA 

00:14:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Fire is a fascinating natural phenomenon, and many of us may enjoy it as a part of daily life for cooking or having a fire in the fireplace or as part of the celebratory ritual such as blowing out candles on a birthday cake. For some people, however, fire elicits emotions and behaviors beyond those considered socially acceptable and safe. The fundamental characteristic of pyromania is repeated episodes of deliberate fire setting. Individuals with pyromania experience tension and arousal before setting fires and pleasure or relief once they have been set. They also demonstrate pointed interest in watching fires burn or related behaviors such as calling the fire department. Those with pyromania do not set fires for tangible gain, as a demonstration of their ideology, as a response to a delusion or hallucination, or to express anger, or exact vengeance. The consequences of pyromania may be severe from the obvious fire damage to property or wilderness up to loss of life. Pyromania occurs more frequently in males with poor social skills and learning difficulties, and is common among adolescents. Additionally, those who frequently set fires, whether they qualify for pyromania or not, often have a history of alcohol use disorder. 

00:15:30
PATHOLOGICAL STEALING 

00:15:30
(KLEPTOMANIA) 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN All right. So I think, If we go see movie first, we'll have time to go get dinner uh… later at Grand Hill. That would be really good. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah, totally. 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Let me… let me check with some plain uh… okay. We can make… okay. We're going to have to leave like right now to be able to make the… 

00:15:50
SEAN HARRIGAN Well, rare pathological stealing, also called kleptomania is known for its fundamental characteristic, stealing. Individuals with kleptomania demonstrate a repeated inability to resist the urge to steal things. These objects are not necessary for personal use or for their monetary worth. These acts of theft are usually committed without an accomplice. These episodes of stealing must not be better explained by a depressive disorder, or a manic episode therein, or another mental disorder. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN What are you doing? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Just listen (inaudible ). 

00:16:32
UNKNOWN Well, you're putting in your purse. Were you going to take that? 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. But it was just a joke. It was just… it's gonna be funny. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Why are you taking my stuff? 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN I didn't have wanted. I don't… I don't care. You didn't want it anyway. 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Are you serious? This has been going on for a long time. You started in the store the other week you… you… you said you were going to stop doing this, and here you are. 

00:16:55
SEAN HARRIGAN Those with Kleptomania are usually aware that stealing is wrong, or if there is a high possibility of being arrested, and therefore, usually try to resist the urge to steal. While ordinary theft, which is often motivated by monetary gain, is relatively common, true kleptomania is rare. It is more common in women than in men. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Because you wanted to watch it. You could have… 

00:17:20
SEAN HARRIGAN Whether dealing with adolescents or adults, impulse and conduct disorders can cause significant disruption in patients' lives. Being familiar with the markers of these disorders can help the clinician recognize the possible patterns behind the impulsive, sometimes even illicit behaviors. This can lead the clinician to a diagnosis, when they can put the patient on the path to recovery, allowing them to live a healthier, more balanced life.
