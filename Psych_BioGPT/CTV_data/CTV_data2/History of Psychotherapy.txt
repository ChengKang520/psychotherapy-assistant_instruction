NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Okay, bye. I like to stand when I talk because when I sit down I go to sleep. I'm 90-years-old, you know. You could, ah,-- the-- I, ah, became interested in psychotherapy, ah, when I was a paratroop in World War two. Ah, the way I got into the paratroops, ah, it was one of the stupidest things I think I ever did. I, ah, finished pre-med and I was, ah, scheduled to go to medical school and I was planning to be a surgeon. And I got to thinking, "Wait a minute! Do I really wanna be a surgeon?" I know my father wants me to be a surgeon but do I wanna be a surgeon? So I wrote my medical school and I said I wanna think about this as my acceptance, ah, good next year. I never heard from the medical school but two weeks later I heard from my draft board and I found myself in basic training in, ah, Abilene, Texas. And they make a nice infantry division which I don't know what they called it that because I had never rode in a vehicle, we always marched 35 miles. So I said, "Well--" I one day, I walked into the company area and there's a bulletin that said, ah, they were forming a new kind of division called the paratroops. It was gonna be named the 82nd air-borne and it was going to be men who were six feet tall or over from 18 to 22 and they were all gonna be volunteers. So I said, Well, you know, jumping out of airplanes has gotta be a lot more fun than walking 35 miles. So I signed up, ah, went through paratroop training and found out that, ah, you jumped out of airplanes and then walked 35 miles. So it wasn't a very good idea. But one of the things we had as paratroopers was what was called Jump Door Fever. And in the paratroops, the casualties were usually the fourth jump, the man-- and this was an average. On the fourth jump you would either get wounded or killed. Three jumps for an officer. And so, the troops, being superstitious and not realizing the law of averages would say, "Oh, you know, I'm-- this is my first jump so I'm okay. It's my second jump, I'm okay." Forgetting that some people would get killed on the first and the second jump. But what would happen is when you've had your third jump and survived it and you're about to make your fourth jump you would say, "Uh-oh, this is the one that I die." And so they would freeze at the jump door. And, ah, there was a jump sergeant who would count to 10 and if they didn't jump out, he put his boot in the back-- in the small of their back, pushed the out. Invariably, what would happen when they hit the ground, they would be in a number 10 panic, forget all their training and would be dead in minutes, shot by the Germans. So, the chief psychiatrist in World War two was William Menninger, the brother of Karl Menninger. And General Menninger conceived of the idea that if somehow, uhm, paratroop officers could talk, talk the panicked trooper to jumping out the door, it would save their lives. So he chose several of us and we got to leave the battlefield and we went to a Mason General Hospital on Long Island, New York where Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, the famous psychoanalyst, Dr. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann taught us how to get the trooper out the door in five seconds. She taught us that although love is the strongest emotion, hate is a mediate where love is long term. So she said, "I'm going to teach you to get the paratrooper to jump by enraging them. Colleagues at work. Let me give you an example. I had a, an 18-year-old trooper, ah, named, ah, Andreatti(ph) that we called Andy for short. And on his fourth jumping, froze at the door. Now, this was not easy for me because this kind of hatred, ah, I despise but Dr. Fromm-Reichmann taught us that if you're gonna save a life, you may have to do things you don't like. So I said to him-- and if you, those of you who know World War history, know that the Italian army disgraced itself. Ah, they lost every battle. The only country they conquered was Ethiopia. Ah, they failed in Greece, they failed everywhere, in the Balkans and so I turned to Andy and I said, "Andy, our American wops as yellow-bellied as Italian wops." He turned to me and he said, excuse the expression, "F you captain!" and he jumped out the door. As I always did I looked up the trooper that I did this to on the ground and before I could say a word why I did this, he put his arm on my shoulder and he said, "Thank you captain, I know why you saved my life." This is the training I got, my first in psychology and when I came out of this service in 1946 I said, "I'm not gonna go to medical school. I wanna become a psychologist!" From the day I became a psychologist, I have been talking about brief psychotherapy. When I went into psychotherapy in the year-- in the mid 40s, everything was long term. Anybody who talked about brief psychotherapy was corrupting, corrupting the clinical science and I got deluged with hate. But I stuck by it. And to this very, very day, ah, I am a champion of brief psychotherapy and will continue to be so. Ah, we'll talk more later as we develop but I wanna pass around to my next colleague.

OTTO KERNBERG Uhm, ah, I'm, ah, I'm, I'm Otto Kernberg. I'm, ah, going to try to, ah, summarize, uhm, history of, ah, psychotherapeutic development within the psychodynamic field. Uhm, my expertise, uhm, I assumed that a large majority, uhm, here in this room had been trained with Cognitive Behavioral Approaches so some of these may be, ah, sound somewhat strange to some of you. Uhm, but, uhm, I, I trust that, ah, as I bre-- proceed with this brief summary, you'll recognize, ah, points of contact with, ah, your ex-- learning and professional experience. Uhm, the, uhm, ah, development of, uhm, ah, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and by the way, when we talk about psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalytic psychotherapy, the-- it's about the same. These are psychotherapies developed out of, ah, basic field of psychoanalysis. A long term, intensive treatment that requires very intensive long term, uhm, educational preparation. Uhm, psychoanalytic education, ah, lasts usual-- between a minimum of five or six to 10 or more years in psychoanalytic treatments. Uhm, ah, they are three or four times a week in some countries. Five times a week over the period of at least three up to five-seven-10 years or more. So, ah, this is an extremely long treatment developed originally by Sigmund Freud and, uhm, uhm, it really became a generalized, ah, treatment, uhm, we might say, in the 1930s, uhm, and, uhm, 1940s and, uhm, very quickly and, and the indications were very broad and sweeping for all kind of psychological conflicts and symptoms what we would now call symptomatic neurosis at this one and, ah, personality disorder access to, uhm, everything except, ah, organic and the psychotic personality disorders. And, uhm, there was very little of any empirical research, ah, involved. Growing dissatisfaction with, uhm, uncertainty, uhm, of the effectiveness, limitations of indications and contraindications that wishes to develop brief, ah, derived methods that brought about the development of psycholytic psychotherapy in the 1940s. Uhm, the German language, ah, shield, ah, uhm, within the United States. Maurice Levine(ph) and others developed, uhm, psycholytic psychotherapy that could be carried out, uhm, one to three times or twice a week until that was based upon the psycholytic theory of a defensive mechanism that protect the patient from unconscious conflict. So it was geared to strengthening appropriate defensive operations and inhibit inappropriate, uhm, non- adaptive defensive operations. Uhm, paying attention to the unconscious aspects of the relationship between patient and therapist. The transference but without interpreting it as would be done in psychoanalysis and this is how ego psychological, ah, psychotherapy was born and developed, ah, around 1940. Uhm, and from 1940 to 1960 the number of, uhm, ah, different experts and, ah, psychoanalyst who were specializing in doing psychoanalytic, psychotherapy develop particularly, uhm, in, in this country and, uhm, uhm, this, ah, culminated I think in, uhm, uhm, around, ah, 1960. Ah, with the development of a major research project to test the efficacy of this kind of treatments manning our foundation. Ah, it was my privilege to participate in that project and to eventually, to become, uhm, the leader of the project and deliver it to its completion in 1972. Ah, it was a comparison between psychoanalysis and psycholytic psychotherapies and, uhm, the fundamental conclusion was that, uhm, psychoanalysis was helpful for, ah, middle range of severity of patients while for either patients, it was helpful but probably not necessary. And for the most severe types of patients, what was helpful was psy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy better than psychoanalysis. One is which transference would, ah, be explored in the context of a protected environment. And, ah, for the most extremely severe cases, is support of psychotherapy might be indicated, just reinforcing defenses and, uhm, that was in contrast to the early assumption that, uhm, with seek a patients' transference should not be explored, would be regressive and the treatment should be purely supportive. Uhm, in e-- that, uhm, that, that treatment of any new(ph) Foundation psychotherapy research project first and then direction of Robert Wallerstein and, and myself. Uhm, had quite an influence, uhm, in, uhm, ah, attention to using that approach refer severe personality disorders in contrast to the continuation of the use of the traditional, legal, psychological, uhm, psychotherapy for middle level and lighter cases. Uhm, eh, simultaneously in the completely independently from that another application of, uhm, psychoanalytic, uhm, theory, ah, was, uhm, developed by Harry Stack Sullivan, uhm, at, uhm, the chestnut lodge, uhm, in Washington, ah, sra-- in Washington and, uhm, led to a generation of psychotherapist who are trying to improve the functioning of schizophrenic and manic, depressive patients by using, ah, psycholytic derived methods analyzing the relationship of psychotic patients to therapist interpreting the transference in that regard. That led to very important understandings of the psychological functioning of such psychotic patients. And at the same time, understanding of the subtleties of, uhm, developmental, very regressive forms of transference, development. But, uhm, came to a relative, rapid halt when psycho pharmacological treatment was developed and to turn out. psychological was much more effective. Ah, rapid in to safe --to employed in the treatment. Both of schizophrenia and manic depressive psychosis. Simultanea-- simultaneously in Great Britain, some psychoanalyst influenced by the, ah, theories of men and decline who was interested in turn in very se-- in, in very sick children. And, ah, it-- and, uhm, develop psychoanalytic technique to deal with very ill children. Some office of that group to become interested in applying that to psychotic patients, Velvet Rosenfeld's(ph) a dominant one. So simultaneously with the Sylvanian approach in the United states, decline in approach in Great Britain started to examine psychotic patients. Again, that fizzed out because it was not effective but in the process, important leaning occurred regarding primitive defense, mechanism or functioning under the very regressive conditions that-- within term, reinforced decline in development of a psycholytic technique geared to very severe character logic of illnesses to severe personality disorders. That was kept completely separate from the development in the United States and only came together, uhm, ah, about 20 years later around 1980 and in which, uhm, on the basis of, uhm, the findings, ah, the meaning of foundation in-- I was able in the personality disorders institute, uhm, at, uhm, Cornell Medical College in New York to develop, ah, specific Treatment for severe personality disorders that used the methodological findings. Of the meaning of project and the discoveries of the Sylvanian and Kleinian school regarding primitive defensive operation and, uhm, and primitive interaction or object relationship of-- and the condition of severe regression to treat patients with severe personality disorders, what we called borderline personality organization. Uhm, and, uhm, this, uhm, development, uhm, gradually expanded to this kind of, uhm, psychoanalytic psychotherapy influenced by Kleinian thinking in the interpretation of severely regressed transferences into specific form of psychotherapy transference focus psychotherapy which is really the application of psycholytic theory to the treatment of severe personality disorders and then refer the modification by Eve Caligor was used for these severe patients as well. At this point, uhm, uhm, we, uhm, are now going to the year, uhm, 2000, we might say that's it. The situation, ah, regarding psychodynamic psychotherapies, uhm, is that, uhm, traditional psychoanalysis has overcome the deep split between Kleinian and ego-psychological psychoanalysis and today have become united in a mainstream of psychoanalytic treatment that nowadays is much more restricted to patients with severe character pathology in an intermediate level of functioning while the treatment of the broad spectrum of psychopathology that used to be carried out with psychoanalysis 20 or 40 years back, yearly is now being treated very effectively, ah, both by cognitive behavior therapies. And by, uhm, psychodynamic psychotherapy still, uhm, based in the old, ah, ego psychological model but with the introduction of, uhm, techniques that were developed by us and that, ah, development of transference focus psychotherapy integrating, uhm, Kleinian, Sylvanian and ego psychological approaches. So at this point, ah, psychoanalysis with a more restricted indication is, ah, taught and carried out in psycholytic institute. Psycholytic psychotherapy particularly for severe personality disorders had been expanding and, ah, is now taught in some psycholytic institute in, in the many institutes of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy. My, ah, more, uhm, ah, short time application of ego psychological psychotherapy has become, uhm, prominent and, ah, and has been empirical research. It includes, uhm, mentalization-based therapy developed in London and the interpersonal psychotherapy I did developed at, uhm, uhm, Cornell and, and Columbia. Brief psychodynamic psycho therapies that have proved effective in the treatment of, ah, multiple symptomatic conditions and, uhm, uhm, much research is going on comparing now. These brief psychotherapies with cognitive behavioral ones and there is a general sense that patients can be treated by a broad variety of both cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic treatments but not all patients respond to all treatments and we still have the task to, uhm, adjust the treatments to the individual needs of patients on the one had and to train experts in the areas of psychotherapies that unfortunately very often are trained in, in the diluted ways both cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic psychotherapies in my experience suffer from that so that the empirical research that, ah, deals with the effort a to prom-- to, ah, contribute to the development of evidence based treatments is carried out at the level that in clinical practice unfortunately not-- is not, is not always followed a major task for all of us at this point. Uhm, a new development within psychoanalysis particular in this country has been the development of relational psychoanalysis very much focused on the, ah, in combination of the analysis of the transference and the assumption that the relationship between therapist and patient is a major source of symptomatic improvement so it is not on the analysis of the unconscious repetition of the past but the provision of a new relationship and the analysis of all the difficulties that stand in the way of using this relationship from the part of the patient to develop-- helpful ways of dealing with his life. That's his-- that's the essential focus of this approach so that psychoanalysis on the one hand, the mainstream Ego psychological, Kleinian, the relational stream and these exists, ah, French model of psychoanalysis which in turn, has differences and is more closely related to an old or classical Freudian approach. Uhm, I have only talked about individual psychotherapy. It would be fascinating to do this for group psychotherapy but fortunately we have here the top expert, ah, Dr. Yalom is going to do that, I'm sure.

00:26:00
DR. IRVIN YALOM I thank you. I'm gonna approach this in a very, ah, different way I think. I'm gonna talk about some excursions I've had in the history of psychotherapy, ah, and some writing that I've done or attempted to do. Thought I'd just take a minute and tell you about a book I never wrote but, ah, there's a really good book and, ah, there's the plot. Man goes to sleep, has a terrible nightmare and, ah, wakes up. The nightmare is a, a real nightmare by definition. Is, is a dream, ah, which you're life is threatened and you are awakened by the dream so he wakes up in a panic. The dream about his own death and, ah, its a, its a nightmare where he's, ah, finding himself buried in the forest and takes off the leaves and sees his own face there. Uhm, as he wakes up horrified, gets out of bed and goes out to search for some help, some psychotherapy if you will. Only, I'm gonna start each-- UI I was gonna start each. I was going to start each chapter with exactly the same dream and the protagonist the dreamer goes out for help but each time it's in a different century. Okay, the first century, okay, he get up and goes out and it's 300 B.C. And then I was gonna have one about middle ages and one later on, one about the 20th century. See what he would do with getting rid, ah, getting psychotherapy for this terrible anxiety that's besieging him. The only one I really worked on is the one 300 B.C. What would, ah, ah, a man who wakes up in Greece was terrified, needs to get some help. Ah, where would he turn? Well, in those days, in 300 B.C. in Greece, he would have gone no doubt to, he were, ah, educated Greek citizen. He would have gone no doubt to, ah, the Garden of Epicurus. Epicurus was, ah, early, ah, Greek philosopher who believed that, ah, the major purpose of our life is that we should live a life of tranquility. And he believe that what really disrupts our tranquility, what besieges all human beings is the fear of death. And so, 2,300 years ago, ah, this, ah, as philosopher and teacher, ah, developed a curriculum for his students to try to free them or ease up their pain of death and they have-- the had a curriculum they had to remember go through like a catechism. Go through this catechism and he had certain statements that they would have to make. You know, one statement was the idea of, uhm, well, where you are, death is not. Where death is, there is not so you and death will never meet. You know, I thought that's going to give them some, some, ah, some calm about that. That's not a whole lot different from Woody Allen's statement that I'm not afraid of death. I just don't wanna be there when it happens and, ah, another one of Epicurus's, ah, ah, psychotherapy helps was what he called the asymmetry argument. An asymmetry argument is the due-- ah, didn't exist for a very long period or time for eons of time. Then you came into existence and now you no longer exist and the state you will be in when you no longer exist is exactly the same state you were in before you were born. And nobody's very anxious about that time before you were born and therefore it's illogical to be so anxious about the time after you're gone. That's not a, ah, its, its not a-- it's a pretty powerful argument actually. I think it holds, ah, ah, a lot of help for, for people. Well, I didn't-- I took so much time working on that first chapter and doing so much historical work on what the Greeks eat for breakfast cuz he was gonna go out and get breakfast or something. This and what they wore. I can't do this. It's sixth-- Epicurus in, in history so I gave-- and I gave that up and I turned that book into a book called Staring at the Sun which starts of talking about Epicurus. Another writing excursion that I developed was, ah, was a book, ah, called When Nietzsche Wept. And I, I was faced there with trying to do something about the history of psychotherapy. And they, they-- the plot starts even before the book starts, is that Nietzsche's involved with a woman, ah, some kind of relationship. Probably, ah, love but non-sexual relationship with a woman named Lou Salomé who was, ah, became very famous, ah, feminist and writer and, and later, ah, psychoanalyst under Freud's tutelage but she was very much involved with Nietzsche and Nietzsche fell into deep despair. Uhm, Lou Salomé may have felt a little guilty about this because, ah, he, ah, re-- may have refused Nietzsche's advances to, to live with her. And so she's, she starts out as the years is 1893. She starts out to find a therapist, ah, for, for Nietzsche. And you can search, ah, the literature as best as you can and you find, ah, there was no field of psychotherapy. It, it really didn't exist. There were a few therapist who were offering hypnotic, ah, suggestions in Léon and Southern France but there was no organized school of psychotherapy. It turns out that in reality, ah, Lou Salomé has a brother who's going to medical school in Vienna and their brother told her that there was a man named Joseph Bryer who, ah, had talked to them about treating a case, the famous case and the most famous case in psychiatric history, psychotherapy has to be the case of Anna O. And it was the, the first case in what we usually think of as contemporary psychotherapy so has it wor-- worked with her? Developed, uhm, a mode of what he called chimney sweeping where she would simply talk about all the things in her mind, free association and, and one by one he clear up her symptoms. Ah, and he worked with her for a couple of years. Ah, it ended up poorly, ah, and there's some issues about, ah, that she had a very strong transference of Breuer and then, and, ah, ah, uhm, it was deluded that, ah, she was pregnant with his baby and, ah, she went to another hospital, ah, and was hospitalized for a while. But Breuer told this story to his-- one of his favorite students in medical school, pseudonym Sigmund Freud. And in a, in a, in, ah,-- so in a sense that's, ah, where the, ah, where, where the movement really began. We often think of Freud as the, as the father of psychoanalysis, ah, but he's really not. He's much more than that. He's the, he's the father of all psychotherapy. Ah, I began scouring the literature about 1890 and earlier on to find there is no organized, ah, movements, ah, in, in psychotherapy. So that's really the, the beginnings of our field. Turned out that Breuer only treated on patient, Anna O., and didn't do any more work in the field. But, but Freud took up the, the, ah, took, took up the burden from that point on. I have Breuer treaty-- treating, ah, treating a second patient and my novel where Nietzsche wept because Breuer then undertook the, the treatment of, of, of Nietzsche who, ah, he is seated to Lou Salomé's, ah, the man. This is all fiction of course. Uhm, and, uhm, and then he, he worked with Nietzsche and, and, and on the, the book is meant to show what psychotherapy would be like if it were invented not by a physician like Freud or Breuer but if it were invented by a philosopher. And for me that was always, ah, a very im-- important thing because I feel that it's a little narrow-minded of us to think of the field really beginning in 1895 with Freud, ah, because there, ah, important life philosophers, layman philosophers going back a couple of thousand years, ah, who really thought a great deal about important questions about the mind and about how we should and why we should live. So I wrote about Nietzsche and wanting to get his ideas out into the minds of psychotherapist. I write another novel about, about Schopenhauer and Schopenhauer lived in the early 19th century. There is certainly no, ah, therapy around. If anyone needed therapy that we have ever seen, it would be Schopenhauer. She was a, ah, a extreme misanthrope, a very brilliant philosopher but simply couldn't get along with anyone. Ah, he needed psychotherapy very much. So I, again, I-- here's another excursion I made in literature who could be his therapist. Ah, there-- it was no such thing as a therapy back in the early 19th-- in the early 19th century. Ah, I eventually settled on a, a, a Jesuit priest. The Jesuits were out of work then. The pope had disbanded the order for a couple of decades so there are lots of, ah, ah, ah, Jesuit priest, ex- Jesuit priest looking for work. So I had Schopenhauer involved with the Jesuit priest of a while that didn't work out either and I gave up that plan. So that's another kind of unwritten book that I had. Uhm, let me say something about what Otto had just mentioned about group therapy. Ah, you know, group therapy, ah, them the first therapy groups in our country, I would say, maybe back in the late 30s, the 1940s, uhm, ah, Sam Psalms and his name that we often think of. Uhm, I, I came into the field of doing group therapy and, ah, the early 60's, 1960-1961, uhm, began doing. And, and when I was arrested and I worked with one of the founders of group therapy named Jerome Frank. Uhm, and at that point that field was very, ah, disorganized. You would, you would see certain people who are running Adlerian groups. Ah, groups based on the work of, of Alfred Adler. Others working with more psychoanalytic groups. Ah, later on, ah, I, I began to develop, ah, approach to group therapy based on, on interpersonal reactions. You know, I, I, I felt that, that, ah, I, I made the assumption. I probably talked about this tomorrow night a little bit. Made the assumption that our patients were all suffering from inability to establish an, ah, maintain a nurturing interpersonal relationship. And so the groups were, ah, perfect. Why for a perfect arena for us to work on and to personal relationships. So I began to describing, ah, an approach to groups where the instructions are that you have to work and try to analyze your relationship with everyone else in that group. So it was a very interpersonally grouped and here and now pace groups. Ah, another modification in, in group therapy came about in the, in the 1960s with a movement that many of you may be too young for a member but it was the encounter group movement which was a, a massive group, ah, movement in this country, ah, beginning with a national training laboratories and more the teaching education. But, but more and more these-- the groups in which these were encounter groups, ah, basic encounter groups. Ah, they were, they were taught to help people understand how they relate to other people. Ah, they, the national training laboratory which is part of national education associates lead these groups for long an many year in, in Bethel, Maine and then they began to move to the west coast. And when they came to West Coast, their, their character changed very much. Carl Rogers was very much involved in the change and they, they thought of as, ah, basic encounter groups. We weren't so much interested in group dynamics. We're more interested in, uhm, in, in saying that, that, ah, that, you know, that group therapy is too good just to be used for the sake. It, ah, this is group therapy for the well. And so there was, ah, ah, huge-- a surge of interest in your counter groups. At Stanford University, ah, in, in the 60's you could go dorm and there are encounter groups being held and all night marathon groups being held, ah, at that point. Uhm, that, that whole movement have more or less come and gone. Uhm, I get a, a long book on encounter groups called Encounter Groups First Facts is the long research study of the effects of these groups. Some of them I thought were quite effective. I, I wrote two, two chapters, one on the casualties of therap-- of the encounter groups and one on the high learners in the groups. People who really profit from that. Ah, a lot of the country was very frightened of the encounter groups and they were threatening our democracy and, uhm, you know, and part of the, the liberal assault on us. And the article I wrote on casualties of group therapy was I never had so much publicity for anything I've written. It's picked up by every newspaper in the country. No one ever talked about the people who really were the high learners, ah, for that group. But gradually, one thing that I know I've tried to do was try to incorporate some of the encounter group technology into the groups because they-- these leaders were very skillful, ah, they knew how to make the groups work. Ah, and so they, ah, ah, you know, I think they do facilitate in hasten the, the, ah, the groups. Okay, I think maybe that's-- but I'll say let me turn this more in a general discussion ?

NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Ah, listening to us here, it sounds like psychotherapy has had a royal from point A to point B. It's been a very rocky road and where once, psycho therapy was absolutely the treatment in mental health. Psychotherapy has declined. Psychotherapy now has become, ah, second to medication. New graduates from our graduate schools are facing 40% unem-- ah, unemployment or underemployment. How do we do this? Well, let me go back to 1965. We'll talk more about this by presentation on Sunday morning. But in 1965, for those of you who are much younger do not remember but that was the year we passed Medicare and Medicaid. I said to myself and that was past, this is going to become the largest psychotherapy benefit in the world. We learned on a Thursday that Secretary Joseph Califano was holding hearings at Washington with all of the health care societies about their place in the Medicare, Medicaid system. Psychology, ah, was at that time, sound asleep. Well, worse than that were in tertiary somnambulism. They did not even respond to Secretary Califano's invitation to come and testify why their profession should be part of Medicare and Medicaid. Social work was still in 1965 passing out food baskets so they weren't there. Counseling was probably the second trimester of gestation. I hadn't been born yet. We learn on a Thursday that the American Psychological Association had not accepted the invitation. Two of us call Secretary Califano. Then he said, "The deadline for the decision is Monday, this is Thursday. If you come and testify, the psychology will be part of Medicare and Medicaid." We hop the plane that night, flew all night to Washington and met with Secretary Califano at 10 o'clock on Friday morning. He explained this to us again. Fortunately, the APA board of directors was meeting that weekend so we went to the board of directors on Saturday, asked to have 20 minutes of their program. Ah, APA President Jerome Bruner from Harvard at that time refused. We tried all day. He would give us 15 minutes. He went there at eight o'clock on Sunday morning again asking to be heard. Finally, presently elect Nicholas Hobbs. Came out and he says, "What's this all about guys?" So we explained to him that what we feel is going to be the largest psychotherapy program of the history of the world was about to be inactive without us. He went back in and he talked Jerry Bruner into to giving us his 15 minutes. We ended up having two hours. He agreed that if I wrote a letter stating all the reasons why psychotherapy should be part of Medicare and Medicaid, he would sign it and he would, ah, sign it that-- on Monday morning before he got off his flight to-- back to Harvard. I stayed up all night writing that letter. Finally, at eight o'clock in the morning and by the way in those days we didn't have, ah, computers, ah, we had the old-fashioned and I hunkered and tapped that whole letter. And in those days, if you made a mistake it was-- you didn't wanna white out a, a, a mistake, a typo. So I would start doing, you know-- so I stayed up all night writing that letter but IU had it here on Jerry Bruner's desk on eight o'clock in the morning. I caught a flight back to San Francisco and I said, "That was a close shave." Six months later I got a call from Jerry Bruner's secretary at Harvard and she says, "Dr. Cummings, I have a letter here addressed to Secretary Califano. What am I supposed to do with it?" And I said, "Oh, my god! We are not part of Medicare and Medicaid." Twenty-five years later, Congressman Pete Stark helped hearings and who did the APA send to address the congressional committee at that time? Me. And we finally...

NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Finally after 25 years of being shut out of Medicare and Medicaid, we got limited entry where in 1965, we could have had total, total involvement. This is just one of a hundred stories I can tell. How we, as practitioners were victimized by the fact that our professional societies were so often 20 years behind what was happening in this world that I hate to say now as we're on the threshold, littered on the threshold of Obamacare. Our professional society is-- are still back in the 1980s and 1990s and this is 2013.

UNKNOWN Ah, well, I have a question I like to ask. And, when you said that the, ah, professional, ah, associations are still the 1980s, the 1990s, ah, what is it that you would like to see happening or believe needs to be happening that's not...

NICHOLAS CUMMINGS The health care environment in this country has changed. What is mental health treatment. It is medication, medication, medication. We can talk about the wonderful advances we have made in psychotherapy treatment but when 80% of physicians in this country pri-- ah, family care physicians are prescribing 80% of the medication to our patients and only referring to psychiatry when that medication fails. And then when they go to a psychiatrist, what do they get? They get another medication, a third one and a fourth one if those don't work. This is where we're failing. This is now, ah, a number of us, ah, I don't know if any of you saw it but, ah, a year and a half ago, we made a series of videos that were 60 seconds. And there were five of us so we made five videos about how psychotherapy could be superior to psychotropic medications if applied judiciously and on time. Those videos were shown in the United States 7,000 times in all 50 states. They were not only on the back channels on TV but they were on NBC, CBS, CNBC, so forth. That now has started if you begun to realize that in the last 68 to 10 months, you seeing more and more articles about the failures of psychotropic medication. That has all been stimulated by those five videos that showed 7,000 times in all 50 states. So colleagues, we've got to regain our profession.

NICHOLAS CUMMINGS Psychotherapy along with medication reduces the effectiveness of psychotherapy. I don't want to disparage the use of medication and appropriate sayings(ph) but when almost all the psychological problems in this country now receiving medication, that is way, way, way too much and it's got to be changed.

OTTO KERNBERG And I think, ah, Dr. Cummings that has touch very important issue and, uhm, uhm, I have a sense that, ah, we are at the beginning of, uhm, review and, ah, second, ah, thought about, uhm, the over extension of the use of medication. I think they are two, ah, factors in this regard. First of all, regarding psychiatry. Ah, we have gone through currents within psychiatry that have been swung wildly between a polarity of total, ah, psycholog-- psychologizing of, ah, everything that psychiatry deals with to the opposite extreme of, uhm, eliminating totally psychological considerations and seeing everything as physical and medical illnesses. Uhm, this, uhm, culminated, ah, it seems to me in recent times, uhm, in the 1950s when most departments of psychiatry were, uhm, ah, the most prestigious one who are run by psychiatrist with the same time while leaders within psychoanalysis, ah, psychoanalysis was, ah, dom-- domineering the whole research enterprise had a hostile and derogatory attitude toward biological psychiatry which created a counter current starting in the 70s and culminating in the 90s which practically eliminated psychoanalysis from the universities shifted the treatment approaches through a purely medical one. This was the highlight of, ah, medication and the gradual disappearance of teaching of psychotherapy in departments of psychiatry. I think that the counter move has set in, ah, in that sense that, uhm, ah, physicians who want to become psychiatrists are interested in the psychological functioning of individuals that move them into that specialty in contrast to remaining neurology. And, uhm, there is an increasing demand for psychotherapeutic training if-- and, and that of course has been supporting in this country and the many other countries. The increase in training and psychotherapeutic institution in general. In addition, empirical research on the effects of the treatment of severe form of psychopathology is shown that medication is really not effective in the treatment of personality disorders. It is very clear that medication nowadays, what, what type is only an auxiliary transitional function in the treatment of the highly prevalent-- the personality disorders that, ah, occupy at least 20% of the time of clinical work in departments of psychiatry and psychiatric institutions in general. So the disappointment in excessive expectation of medication I think is developing-- they have there clearly indications and contra indication but there is a growing awareness through empirical research of the effects of good psychotherapeutic treatment in terms of patients functioning in the major areas of your life that count the capacity to engage in work and profession. That capacity to engage in commitment to love and sex. The capacity to engage in social life and to develop personal creativity. I don't think we're going to abandoned these ideals beyond the fact that appear. That patients should become symptom free and I think that, that, uhm, dream, professional aspiration of the new generation of psychiatrist are believed, uhm, changing, ah, direction in that regard. And of course, uhm, the development of research is not an exclusive, ah, terrain, territory of, ah, of psychiatry but, uhm, ah, clinical psychology, ah, has very important instruments, models and contributions to carry out. And it seems to me that there are lions of clinical psychology and clinical psychiatry. The focus on research on effectiveness and mechanisms, uhm, of modification of psychological illness will foster and demonstrate the importance of psychotherapy and put rational limits to the use of medication. At least, that's the prospective from where I'm working and carrying out the research.

UNKNOWN Sad to say we've, ah, run out of time. Ah, so if everyone will, ah, one last thank you for our, our expert panel.
