Finding new life after the death of a child 

00:00:55
JOE GUAY This video is for any parent who has experienced the death of a child, and for those who aim to help someone who is grieving, this sort of grief can sometimes take a lifetime to heal but it has to begin somewhere, sometime. With this video you will be introduced to topics such as knowing you are not alone, dealing with the loss of hopes and dreams, grieving the death of a baby, the family's grief journey, and how to honor, and remember your child.

PART ONE 

00:01:30
Knowing you are not alone 

00:01:35
JOE GUAY Khris Ford, founder of my healing place and Paula D'Arcy, founder of the Red Bird foundation, work with adults and children as they move through grief. Both Khris and Paula's work has been deeply influenced by their firsthand experiences with the death of a child. 

00:01:50
KHRIS FORD My son Steven was killed in automobile accident at age 16, left home one morning for school and that afternoon all the way home was an accident. My world changed dramatically from then on. 

00:02:10
PAULA D'ARCY My daughter Sarah was almost 2 years old when she was killed. We were in an automobile accident that involved a drunk driver, our car was hit and Sarah and her father lost their lives. I was three months pregnant and in a shock I wouldn't have believed. When you lose a child something is happened that is just unthinkable, it's something that seems to shatter the foundation of your very life it breaks the order of the universe and there's no preparation, there's no way anybody has ever simulated this with any other kind of loss. 

00:02:50
KHRIS FORD Without knowing that we believe that we are going to see our children umm… grow older and that they will be there for us. If my child is not going to live for me to see them grow old and their children then what is true. What can I believe if I can't believe that? 

00:03:05
PAULA D'ARCY One of the things even in loosing a young child was just like have meaning even though it's, it's brief like what, what is life, what, what are we doing here, dare I love knowing that the risk of any love is actually is that one day one of us, you know, will not be here. I was asking myself something as basic as will I enter back into life, now that I've seen this power that obviously has always been here, but I've never seen it play its hand before. And now that I know this now that I know in the blink of an eye things can change, will I be able really to enter into life wholeheartedly. 

00:03:55
JOE GUAY One of the aspects of grief after a child dies that makes the grief difficult for parents is that the parent child bond is unlike any other human connection. 

00:04:05
KHRIS FORD As a parent grieving a child's death, there's often that, that sense of almost your body remembering what it is to run your hands through their hair, or as I often do to Steven and this piece of hair that would fall down on his face and I would be constantly pushing it away. And having that experience even just that body experience for me to bring that or umm… he was kind of a practical joker, he would walk up behind me and umm… put his knees behind my knees and there were times when I could almost feel that. Umm… just that amazing connection that umm… somehow he's still there and yet he's not. 

00:04:45
CARLENE SOUTH Well, tell about those, what are those things? 

00:04:50
JOE GUAY Carlene South and her grandson Ben lived together in Austin, Texas. Carlene's daughter Megan, Ben's mother died unexpectedly from an undiagnosed heart condition nine months ago. 

00:05:00
Carlene South 

00:05:00
CARLENE SOUTH I find I have to actively practice detachment from Megan's physical manifestation. They came out of our bodies and were so used to having them physically, umm… that it's a real challenge to detach from that because we don't have that. When I could finally be quiet and still on my own and invoke her presence and connect with what is really real. Then I could begin to detach from that physical. And I have to keep very, very practicing that 'cause I am a mom. 

00:05:55
JOE GUAY Jacob Moya age 14 was an active youngster who went off to summer camp. Over the course of that summer he contracted the H1N1 virus which turned into staff pneumonia and a bacterial infection. Four weeks after arriving home from his summer activities he tragically died leaving a loving family confused in grief stricken. 

00:06:20
Tanya Moya 

00:06:20
TANYA MOYA I Was holding his hand and I don’t know I was standing by him and they turned off the machine, cranked up the ventilator, his heartbeat, you could see it, gradually, you know, slow, slower, slower, slower. They pronounced him at 12:45 on a Saturday morning. I've lost my grandparents and I've lost aunts and uncles in the last of four years but loosing my son was the toughest thing for me. I carried him for nine months, I took care of him and I had him four years, just him and I, before Vanessa came along and we spent a lot of time together. We had a close bond. 

00:07:05
JOE GUAY When a child dies, parents often question whether they could have prevented the death of their child. 

00:07:15
KHRIS FORD Even though in my head I knew that there I had not done anything that caused Steven to die, there was still that sense that if I just hadn't done this or if had done that. 

00:07:30
KELLY PEACKOCK Should we have called the ambulance that night, if we did, would he still be with us. 

00:07:35
JOE GUAY Bill and Kelly Peacock's son John was born with a rare brain malformation. John spent many weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit until Bill and Kelly decided to enroll him in hospice, and to take care of him at home. 

00:07:50
KELLY PEACKOCK We decided to learn how to take care of him where he'd be comfortable and not have to take him back to the hospital. One night we went out to dinner, we got a call little bit into the meal and that from a nurse that, John seemed like his breathing wasn't doing great, our hospice doctor came over. Our doctor said go ahead and put him in your lap because it looks like this might be it. And so umm… we did and we were in his room and he was in my lap and Bill was there and he passed away very peacefully. 

00:08:25
JOE GUAY John was seven months old when he died. 

00:08:25
KELLY PEACKOCK I just want him back and I had… it doesn't matter if, you know, he's having a seizure or he can't breathe or we're putting a, a, uh… a needle on his bone, I just want him back and did I do the wrong thing? 

00:08:40
TANYA MOYA He had four chest tubes and he had 25 intravenous lines, there was so much machines in his room. My first reaction was, "Oh my God, what do we do to our baby, what do we let them do to him. 

00:09:00
PAULA D'ARCY Nobody is ever prepared to make the kind of decisions that sometimes have to be made in order to, to preserve or insure, so you hope, you know, the life of your child. So everyone comes into that ill equipped and doing it in a state of panic and a state of, you know, the depths of love I mean it's, it's not the place from which to make the most sound decisions, but so many people walk through this. I think always of that Greek saying, "Be gentle, every person, you know, is fighting a terrible battle." People heal through this, they do, they are heroic. 

00:09:40
JOE GUAY The loss of a child is devastating and it causes our lives to be reshaped. 

00:09:45
PAULA D'ARCY The loss of a child is so devastating in every cell, every fiber of your being that you entered really like a not ordinary state, a state in which you can no longer cope with the simplest things. I remember a friend whose son had been killed in an accident, standing in the kitchen, looking at the cupboards and saying to me, I know that if you open these cupboards, and take out food items and put them together you create something called a meal, but I no longer remember how to do it. 

00:10:20
KHRIS FORD As we are grieving the death of a child, that piece of us that is lost umm… and gets completely umm… turned upside down. And, and I like to think of it is, as if somebody has come along and taken a jigsaw puzzle that we're working on and completely flipped it up in the air and it's come down and there is no order whatsoever to it. So here we are trying to reshape this picture of our life, put those pieces back together inside as well as outside. So it's another layer of that loss that calls into question who am I? Umm… can I function in life anymore?

Mary Sisson 

00:11:05
Adult son died of cancer 

00:11:05
MARY SISSON My son died just a little over a year ago and I still finding it hard to sleep, I'll sleep really late in the morning then and sometimes, you know, two or three hours after I've gotten up I need a nap. It's just little routine things in life that most people just do without even thinking, it's is a huge chore for me. 

00:11:20
Chris Hubner 

00:11:20
Daughter died of cancer 

00:11:25
CHRIS HUBNER Grief takes an awful lot of energy, right. I mean it is its work, it's really hard work. And so, you know, as you're struggling with grief these cope mundane things that you mention become so hard to do, in fact maybe you don't even have the energy to do them, but you still have the energy. It's just that the grief is now sucking the life out of you, right, or it feels that way and I have certainly felt that way and then everything else just becomes a struggle. My oldest daughter Maya died now 4 1/2 years ago and I'd like to share with you and hope that things will get better that the energy comes back. I don't know that what ever the way we were before, I don't want to be the way I was before. We learned too many insights and too many really powerful valuable lessons like sitting in a group like this sharing our commonalities which is that we all suffered loss. And umm… I remember an oncology nurse said this at the hospital. She said that "The only way to get through hell is to go through hell." And in going through grief we have to keep going and if it means getting dressed in the afternoon or bouncing your checkbook six months later, that's just what it means. In my opinion, I'm no expert, I'm not a psychiatrist, psychologist, but I, I do have an understanding of, of the work, it's really, really hard work. 

00:12:45
PAULA D'ARCY Healing is possible. It's, it's the amazing thing about human life, that sometimes we can sustain wounds and come through trauma in, in ways that are unspeakable and yet find a resilience within ourselves, that in spite of having had these experiences we still find there is a depth of love that is greater than even the loss. 

00:13:15
"It is the amazing thing about human life, that we can sustain wounds in ways that are unspeakable and yet, in spite of having had these experiences, find a resilience inside ourselves, a depth of love that is even greater than the loss."

00:13:30
PART TWO 

00:13:30
Dealing with the loss of hopes and dreams 

00:13:30
JOE GUAY When a child dies, hopes and dreams invested in that child are shattered. 

00:13:40
PAULA D'ARCY In losing a child, you realize than the investment that you have in this life is like a particular part of your dream for life, and your hope for life is in the life of that child. So you see your dreams shattered, you see your hopes allayed you. You know that you are now going to walk on a different road and you can imagine what that would be because the focus has been so, you know, the hope of, of this, this particular dream being lived out. 

00:14:15
CARLENE SOUTH It took me a while before I began to comprehend that she wasn't going to be taking care of me when I was old, it's a whole paradigm, umm… shift when a child dies because it's out of order. It's not supposed to happen like that, it's a paradigm shift for me and then she was a mother so, it's extremely complicated. 

00:14:40
Bill Peacock 

00:14:45
BILL PEACOCK That halfway through his life three months, four months it, it became pretty apparent to everybody that, John was not going to live a normal life that, as long as he was alive he was going to be bedridden, he'd probably never be able to talk. You know, there would be not a lot of communication going on, so I think at that point is when we really started experiencing that loss of our hopes and dreams for John. John was never gonna going to high school, John was never going to grow up and get married, you know, all those kind of things, we had to struggle with that loss while we were still taking care of John. 

00:15:20
KELLY PEACOCK And I was also thinking about William and how he had longed for and hope for a sibling for so long. I think that's the most difficult part for me about the loss of John is the loss for William and his brother, his only brother. I think for me and especially when we're doing something as a family whether it's hiking or going to the beach, and, and there's just this significant, you know, void. Because I think what John should be, you know, sitting in the sand digging and playing with William and they should be sword fighting and they should, you know, that's the, that's where it cuts the deepest for me. 

00:15:55
Henry Moya 

00:15:55
HENRY MOYA It's hard to have some your, that's all you have had 14 years, just all of a sudden snatched from you. Today I was talking to him, I was talking to him about that I feel kind of angry and upset because I will never see what kind of grown up his, he would be, what kind of grandchildren I would have. And what kind of wife he would pick. 

00:16:30
KHRIS FORD When I think about that loss of the dreams and the future, I remember in particular finding a project that Steven had worked on in sixth grade and it was who do I want to be when I grow up. And he had made this lovely book of his dreams and the idea of who he wanted to be and what he wanted to do, and I remember looking at that and it was like I was holding in my hands my future along with his, and that was to no longer be. I remember going to the first wedding after Steven died, and realizing that I would never be the mother of the groom. Umm… I remember going to those first graduations, and knowing that we would never see Steven walk across that stage. So it's all of those events that you look forward to and you build toward, umm… as your children are growing older. Umm… It's a umm… huge piece of that loss. 

00:17:35
JOE GUAY The primary role of parents is twofold, to prepare and teach the child how to live in love and to protecting guard their child against all danger. 

00:17:45
PAULA D'ARCY When it's a young life, I feed you I, I take care of you, I put you down for naps, everything in your being is wired toward protecting and taking care of this child. And then suddenly, you know, where are you and my arms are empty and I'm no longer taking care and it feels wrong in such a profound way that it's hard even to express it. 

00:18:10
BILL PEACOCK I remember when we had just moved John over to dell and John started was breathing episodes and then they pushed, I think it was a code blue or whatever it was at the hospital and people just came rushing in, because he, he wasn't breathing, his oxygen levels were dropping really low. I found myself sitting kind of in the back corner, because there wasn't anything I could do, you know, as a father and a husband I'm, I'm here to protect my family and, and I couldn't do anything for my son at that point of time. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN For the parent whose only child dies, it means that their entire identity gets called into question," Am I still a parent, who am I?" 

00:18:50
"Am I still a parent? Who am I? 

00:18:55
CARLENE SOUTH I know when she first died maybe only she had been dead about a week or so and we went to a neighborhood uh… party, there were people there we didn't know. And umm… a woman turned to me Umm… and said, "do you have kids?" and I said, "well, yes, but my daughter died," and she said, "Oh, I'm so sorry how long ago was that?" and I said… "A week or two I don't remember how long it was." She was horrified umm… but, umm… so then that made me think about what am I, I don't want to horrify people. But also I'm not a, umm… I'm still a mom. Well, I'll always be a mother whether my child can sit with me physically or not. 

00:19:45
PAULA D'ARCY The question that was asked to me of course so many people say this so often, you know, how many children do you have and you don't, you don't know how to answer, if you say that, you know, you have, you have none or you, you have one if you have a remaining child however, many you have, then you feel like you have umm… denied this child and yet if you, if you give the total count of your children including the child who has died, then it, it raises questions that you may not be able to answer easily in that setting or that people may really not want to hear. So in, in every way umm… the future that you had, that the, the life is called into question and you're going to have to go back and dream new dreams and the death of the dream is a very, very difficult thing. 

00:20:40
"You are going to have to go back and dream new dreams. And the death of a dream is a very, very difficult thing." 

00:20:50
Janie Cook 

00:20:50
Thirty-year old son died by suicide 

00:20:50
JANIE COOK It's a time in your life when something really deepening, and stretching, and growing, as a chance to happen. And so I would want to say don't waste that opportunity to grow because you get totally stripped down from every kind of defense and every kind of facade that you've ever built. It just gets torn away and that's better. As hard as that is to see in the beginning, I think that that is what great suffering has to offer us. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:45
PART THREE 

00:21:45
Grieving the death of a baby 

00:21:45
JOE GUAY When a baby dies, life is cut short, hopes and dreams are broken. 

00:21:50
Angela Gottschalk 

00:21:50
ANGELA GOTTSCHALK Our first daughter was Leyna Gabrielle Gottschalk, the entire pregnancy with her I was told that she was healthy and I was healthy and we were the ideal mother and baby. I had a scheduled umm… injection and then I went into labor the night before, I was trying really hard to have this natural birth toward the end of the day, you know, things still weren't progressing well, so my doctor suggested we're going to have a C section and we're getting a little nervous about her heart rate. We were going through the surgery and it seemed really easy. Umm… I knew that I wasn't hearing what I was supposed to hear, and there was no baby crying. She died 34 minutes after she was born unexpectedly. And the next hardest thing was leaving the hospital without my baby, and umm… umm… you just expect to leave the hospital with your baby. That's just when you envision all of this stuff in your head, I think that's one of the things you envision, you know, you're prepared for the car seat, and the journey home and the nursery, and taking the babe to the house for the first time. 

00:23:05
KHRIS FORD Even for umm… the couple who loses a child due to miscarriage, that pregnancy is the only set of memories that they have to go back to the feeling that baby moving, and yet that memory is so tainted when we know how the ending has happened. So they don't really even have those memories to go back to without that shadow of death being there and loss being a part of that memory. 

00:23:35
PAULA D'ARCY The early loss is so easily dismissed by other people. Well you'll get pregnant again, you're young, you didn't really know them. And to be in that atmosphere where people aren’t honoring how deep the loss is, can also be a real factor in the heaviness of the grief. It's the hope, it's the dream, there's a future, you already saw. 

00:24:05
JOE GUAY The grief after the death of a baby needs to be given time and space. 

00:24:15
PAULA D'ARCY There's no such thing as moving right along. The grief has to be honored, the loss has to be acknowledged. I went through this, it was, it was difficult, it was painful and in honoring it, you meet it, and in meeting it you allow the pain to pass through. 

00:24:35
JOE GUAY Families whose infant dies after many weeks or months spent in the neonatal intensive care unit may have multiple experiences of trauma, this experience overrides the grief of the parent. 

00:24:50
KELLY PEACOCK Having a child on the (inaudible ) is, is a constant battle of, of staying up and staying umm… alert and ready for whatever's going to happen. There were times when I would hold him and he would be quiet and I'd get a chance to cry or, but he was just so busy, there was always alarms going off and beeping and I felt like we were in the middle of this grieving process of, of losing him, but yet not having lost him yet. And, and I think it wasn't until I walked him out to the car when he died and set him on the cot and say good bye to him and walked in and closed the door. Then it all, there was just this emptiness. 

00:25:35
KHRIS FORD The parents are grieving through all of this but the trauma of all these surgeries and interventions and the ups and downs overrides this grief in such a way that, it's almost as if when it's over, the parent suddenly realizes oh my goodness, I have not even been able to grieve what's happened. 

00:25:55
BILL PEACOCK Once that door closed when he was gone. It was a new thing, there would always been something to do. Reminded me of going up Mt Everest to me, those guys from the final ascent of Everest they take a step like every 30 seconds, because they can't breathe, but they still make that step. And that's what it was like in the (inaudible ) for me is it didn't matter whether I can breathe or not, I, I just had to take that step, because that's what we had to do. But then when we got home there's no more steps to take and that's when I probably struggled more rather than. You know, that because also, all I had to do was feel him, you know, that's something that's just right at the top of my desires. 

00:26:40
JOE GUAY Often part of the grief process after a baby dies is working through feelings of guilt, this is especially true for mothers. 

00:26:50
ANGELA GOTTSCHALK Immediately I blamed myself, I thought in my attempt to not, you know, to have this natural birth that had caused her death. My questions have always been for five years, is there anything I could have helped her live at all. 

00:27:05
KELLY PEACOCK Because he was in my womb and I carried him and, you know, he was born and he had this brain malformation, I felt like, you know, I questioned every step of the pregnancy and what could I have done. And I know there's nothing that I did wrong or that I could have done differently but, you know, that was a really hard thing. 

00:27:20
A couple's grief differs greatly 

00:27:25
JOE GUAY Where there is a loss through miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death, a couple's grief differs greatly. 

00:27:35
KHRIS FORD In this case umm… I think it gets accentuated by the fact that the woman has carried this child and has a real body connection in a way that is different, it is different than the father. Umm… and therefore the project trajectory of that process is a little different, and often umm… or I don't believe the husband really means to dismiss, I do think there is just a lack of understanding of the depth of the pain that there is for the woman who has lost this baby. Umm… And often I think there is sort of a push toward, let's move forward, let's just think about getting pregnant again long before that mom is really ready umm… to move to that place again. And it causes a lot of friction umm… and stress in the marriage. 

00:28:25
PAULA D'ARCY The same way that you, when you're gestating a seed life gets a little bit quieter sometimes and you allow the space for the life to grow, then you have to allow the space afterwards for all of the feelings and all of the memories and all of the loss to be held. It's a really vital space and the people that I see whose healing is the strongest are, are the people who've given space and acknowledgement to that. 

00:28:55
JOE GUAY Subsequent pregnancies after the death of a baby are often laden with fear. 

00:29:00
PAULA D'ARCY For me I was pregnant at the time of the loss of my umm… first daughter and there was something that, forever was taken from that pregnancy because now you knew that things could happen. There was no longer an innocence and that felt in, in some ways like such a layer of loss. 

00:29:25
ANGELA GOTTSCHALK I didn't get pregnant again, I guess I just tried to numb myself to the pregnancy, I knew I was pregnant, I knew it was just, I knew there was another baby, not the same baby. But how excited do you get, I just wanted the pregnancy to be complete and to have a baby. Kares(ph) is our second daughter, she was born healthy and everything was beautiful. So that was umm… probably the next phase of just umm… some level of healing with having Kares(ph). Taking Kares to Leyna's grave for the first time and, you know, experiencing all those first things with Kares that we were supposed to experience with Leyna. And just trying to umm… just figure out how the two children experiences fit together. 

00:30:20
JOE GUAY Honoring your baby that has died whether through a miscarriage, stillbirth, or infant death is an important part of the grief process. 

00:30:30
ANGELA GOTTSCHALK Spend as much time with your child's body as you need to spend, as you can possibly spend, take as many pictures of, as you can if it's appropriate and it feels okay. 

00:30:40
JOE GUAY One of the important ways to honor a child who dies before birth is to give that child a name. 

00:30:45
KHRIS FORD Worked in the last couple of years with a young woman who lost their baby very, very early and they were not even able to determine the gender. Umm… And so she struggled with this name thing and I said, I finally said, what in your gut says to you, what does it say to you about, is this a boy, is this a girl just I am like I always believed it was a girl. Well, I said then trust that and name it, name her, and honor her. Umm… it just is the most basic way that we give umm… real life to what was life. 

00:31:25
JOE GUAY Finding life after the death of a baby is possible. Give yourself time to heal. 

00:31:30
ANGELA GOTTSCHALK Here I am five years later and I have four young children in our house, under four years old. And so it's still a process of Leyna is still so important to me and so it's, I still have parts that I want to heal for sure. Just to know however sad you are and however, however awful it feels is, is okay. 

00:32:00

00:32:10
PART FOUR 

00:32:10
The family's grief journey 

00:32:15
JOE GUAY One of the primary areas of impact after the death of a child is on the marriage relationship. 

00:32:20
KHRIS FORD The image that I have often have is that in a marriage is that sometimes one is pulling the card and the other one gets to write and, and then we have to swap, umm… and pull the other one sometimes. And when a child dies neither of you has the strength to pull the card and not only can we not support each other but often the person that we look to is doing this so differently than we do it. 

00:32:45
JOE GUAY There is a difference between how women and men grieve, the challenge for a couple is to allow each other to walk separate paths with the hope of finding healing together along the way. 

00:32:55
KELLY PEACOCK You're both walking through the same thing but there's all these different influences of, of your own, they're affecting how you're going to process it all, and so you think, what we're going through the same exact thing we must be feeling exactly the same, but we're not. You know, I really am struggling with this, but he's not and why. And he seems to have trouble with, with this issue and I don't know why is questioning that.

HENRY MOYA I had to be the strong one, and yet I will cry, and Tanya and Vanessa, also help me they say dad or Henry, why are you crying, and I said, "I'm not crying." Tear rolling down my eyes. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN It's leaking. 

00:33:45
HENRY MOYA Yeah it's just leaking that's water. 

00:33:45
TANYA MOYA He is grief different might then I did this like one check first passed away, he was like why are you walking around shell shocked or why are you uh… you know, you look like you're stunned or whatever, and uh… snap out of it and… 

00:34:05
HENRY MOYA Never good to say snap out of it. 

00:34:10
TANYA MOYA He's controlled as well, I'm not him and he's not me and we have to each grieve in our own way. 

00:34:20
KHRIS FORD I know that I fell early into the trap of, well he do, he's doing it differently and it must not be the right way because it's not like my way. And, you know, it's so hard to avoid that judgment and yet it's so critical that we work really hard at not judging our partner or husband or wife because they have to do it their own way, I had to do it my way, he needed to do it his way. 

00:34:50
PAULA D'ARCY Grief needs to move, we need to get it from inside to outside and, and women as a whole tend to, to want to speak about their feelings. They are, are usually umm… very comfortable in the land of relating and so to tell a woman we now have a support group, it'll be all mothers and you'll sit knee to knee and you'll be able to share and tell your story. It's usually extremely comforting and healing for a woman. To tell a father or to tell men, we're going to go into a, a group and you'd be sitting and telling your story, they usually will run for the hills. Umm… it's very different typically, you know, four men and many men in their grief find their way through by doing. 

00:35:35
KHRIS FORD My own husband one of the things that he did is that he whittled, he had a walking stick that umm… he would sit out on the deck, umm… like house that we had, and he would chip away at that walking stick. And we had a friend who umm… spent time a lot of time with us after Stephen died and Umm… as Paul said they would often just sit out there umm… not saying much to each other as John chipped away very slowly at this walking stick. And then there were times when as he was doing that they would talk about Steven, they would share memories of him, umm… in a very different way than the conversation that would happen with he and I. Umm… it was an extremely healing piece for him. 

00:36:25
PAULA D'ARCY You know I had the unusual experience that when I lost my child I also lost my spouse, and so I had to really renegotiate what I thought family was and I am aware of how many people are, are single parents and, and go through this kind of loss and it's its own special niche. And what I had to learn to do was to, to broaden my circle and to bring in people in my community, umm… people who showed up literally at the door interestingly at a time when I felt so alone. At the same time I also felt never more connected and never more apart of just the world of, of life. 

00:37:15
JOE GUAY Each person within a family will grieve in his or her own way. 

00:37:20
KHRIS FORD You have this sort of Merry go round effect of the life cycle of the families moving and everybody else is moving too but we're all going at it at different paces, and in different ways, and it makes for a really chaotic sort of home. 

00:37:35
PAULA D'ARCY I think when nothing is causing us to be authentic about feelings that lots of times family systems or marriages just come along with everybody hiding many things. And grief is like a great search light and it's putting light on what ever the links in the chain are, are weak. And I just like to emphasize that again if time can be given, if, if people can just bear with the fact that everything is torn up now, it's also this is the seed of healing and healing is, is possible. 

00:38:15
HENRY MAYO Sometimes we even imagine him in the chair. A head and only few little talk to him, and but, you know, it's, it's weird to, you know, it's different. 

00:38:25
JOE GUAY Vanessa is Jacob's sister, she is Eleven years old and now is the only remaining child. 

00:38:30
Vanessa Moya 

00:38:30
VANESSA MOYA It's different because umm… I used to set four plates at the dinner table and sometimes I still do, so, and not having him there to protect me anymore or we used to do puzzles together as a family and he used to come down at night when everybody was asleep and he would do. 

00:39:00
KHRIS FORD One of the patterns that I've seen as I've worked with families is that, often in the first few weeks perhaps even first few months after the death of a child, there is this unbelievably honest time and vulnerable time. It's as if we can't be anything else, we just have to be where we are. But what I see is that after a few months that that often begins to umm… get scary and so there is this kind of drifting apart and somewhat less intimacy umm… emotionally and if we can somehow umm… catch ourselves before we drift too far apart in that pattern, I think can be the beginning umm… again umm… strengthening. 

00:39:55
JOE GUAY After a child dies the communication within the family changes. 

00:40:00
KHRIS FORD I just think it's so crucial for couples and other children in the family if there are surviving children, to be able to talk about what they need, to be able to say I really, you know, would really help me to be able to look at videos and umm… kind of remember in that way. I love to go back and laugh and someone else to say "oh I just can't do that." Somehow be able to communicate what those needs are, so that it becomes okay to have a different style of grieving and still be able to gat that need met. 

00:40:30
PAULA D'ARCY There's no map quest for grief, there's no, one way only that it can be done. I hate when I see people feel that they're health was standard but we didn't do it the right way or it's not happening this way, or my partner and I are finding our way, the way, the ideal, you know, seems to be. And I think there's, there's no ideal and there's no gold standard. There's just fighting our way through and sometimes it's really messy, and sometimes it's not at all what the textbook would say, it's your way. Everybody finds their way. 

00:41:05
KHRIS FORD I remember so poignantly about a week after Steven died we went to the airport to take good friends to return home, and Jennifer and John and I were there together and this was the sort of the last of the visitors in our home. And it was as if we, we all knew without saying it, that now we had to go about the business of really figuring out, how to do this. And again without saying anything to plan it, the three of us linked arms and sort of skipped down the hallway of the airport saying out loud, we can do this, we're going to do this. And it was the beginning of getting up that morning and saying, we're going to live, we're going to do this differently. Umm… and I do think that we've had family say to us. We made a strong statement about what it is to get up and move on and find morning in the middle of darkness, to really find day again. 

00:42:05
JOE GUAY When a family is moving through grief it is often necessary and helpful to reach out beyond the family unit for help. 

00:42:20
BILL PEACOCK I think one of the greatest things that came out of John's life was the relationships. It's really reached our lives, if we're writing a story I don't think we'd go back and say well let's lose our sons we'd have all these great relationships, and everything. Yet they're still something that I cherish and something that we cherish and that had been very important to us and then helped us go through this process, so I would encourage other parents who go through this process to embrace those relationships who are out there, and let them try inward, uh… you know, look for ways to, to find them and then the folks that are out there. 

00:42:55
PAULA D'ARCY I'd just like to say something to that about being a single parent, these were the days when I learned to say to someone else I need help, these were the days when I, I learned to say could, could you watch my child for a while so that I could have some space for my grieving. And as she grew I, I learned to go to others and to say I need another set of eyes on this request of my teenage daughter, could you help me to think things through. These are all adjustments that I made in, in terms of my style of relating to the world and, and getting help both for my daughter and, and for myself. 

00:43:35
CARLENE SOUTH What you call Benny? 

00:43:35
BENNY Oh, pirate mania. 

00:43:35
CARLENE SOUTH Pirate mania. I have an errand friend, she doesn't have to do the errands, it's just even after nine months difficult umm… sometimes not every day. But sometimes to umm… be in large groups of people at the grocery store or umm… just every day errands and it's very, very helpful to have umm… someone just be with me that grounds me and gives me a focal point. I don't feel like I am umm… flowing out into all that in and unable to contain being in those situations. So that's one way and certainly been able to umm… identify which people can be fully present for Ben and be with him, and really be with him so that I can just let all of it go and umm… go do some things that help me. 

00:44:45
JOE GUAY Joining a grief support group can be very helpful for parents by surrounding them with supportive and understanding relationships. 

00:44:50
CARLENE SOUTH The first time I went to group, I was actually okay, and then I walked in and I didn't know anyone but Chris and she wasn't the facilitator. And I just started crying, and they just let me sit on the couch and cry and every time someone spoke to me, I cried more and, you know what, that was great. It felt great, it was perfect to them to do that and Megan had already been dead a month. 

00:45:25
JOE GUAY When a child dies, families must learn how to integrate that loss into their ongoing lives. 

00:45:30
KHRIS FORD So often when people talk about the death of a child, there's this language around having to let go. This is not an experience necessarily of letting go or putting it behind. It's simply about learning to carry that child differently in a whole new way. 

00:45:50
Chris Hubner 

00:45:50
Daughter died of cancer 

00:45:50
CHRIS HUBNER I make a really conscious effort to try to include my daughter in everything that I do. I feel strongly that, you know, we had three children and I still have three children. I remember when she died in our bedroom and they came and took her lifeless body, and that was no longer my daughter but I still have a relationship with Maya and so doing things like this, doing things at the hospital, hospice work, Caroline is great about pulling me in on different things. But maybe you get to help somebody else or maybe you get to share something that somebody can relate to and, and then I really give my all the credit for that. I think her, her inspiration was just phenomenal. I remember a good friend of mine said, you know, "We all stand on the shoulders of those who've gone before us." And it's a really odd humbling feeling to stand on my own daughter shoulders. You know, 13 years old but it's, it's a, it's a big, it's her father's big responsibility now. I've got to really work on that, and I hope that never ends. I don't, I don't expect that it will but I have to work it that it's not just gonna happen. 

00:47:05
KELLY PEACOCK We tried really hard as a family to incorporate John into our lives, we talk about him, you know, sometimes at the dinner table, sometimes when we're out hiking, when it's his birthday we have cupcakes. And we occasionally go to the cemetery and take some flowers or just sometimes run around and play soccer in the field next door. John will always be a part of our family. 

00:47:30
PAULA D'ARCY Sarah was so young when she died and so it's a little bit different when it's a child that is not extremely verbal, and so you haven't shared thoughts or you don't know how somebody thinks or what they were gonna grow up to be. But it certainly, I wrote letters to her for months and months and months past her death, because I knew I wasn't done yet in saying the things that I wanted to say until just as Chris said, it was like learning a new language, it was the language of the heart. It's like taking the very best of something and bringing that on with you, and in time the painful memories became more and more dim and what carried with me was, was the essence of, of just her being and that experience of loving someone, you know, first child in that way. 

00:48:25
KHRIS FORD As the process of moving through, that loss happens that our identity has bereaved parent. Somehow, it changes and it becomes integrated into a bigger story. So I'm not a bereaved parent anymore, I'm a parent and I'm a parent of Steven, I'm also a parent of Jennifer. But it's just a bigger story and Steven is a piece of that, he's a wonderful piece of that story but it's not the piece. 

00:49:00
Paula Bryant 

00:49:00
10-year old son died of complications from Lupus 

00:49:00
PAULA BRYANT I want to embrace the fact that you are a parent that has lost a child and the… These are the, you know, this is who you are. This is now a part of your story and you just have to go through this process of dealing with the ups and the downs, and the step forwards and the steps backwards and once you get, you know, kind of wrap your mind around that. It makes the process a little bit easier to deal with and you're gonna hopefully have friends and supports that will help you like we have here. But, just be kind to yourself and give yourself the opportunity to break down when you want to know or, you know, if you're having a good day. Enjoy the day that you're having, but don't beat yourself up about, you know, things that come your way that, you know, don't really handle the way you think you should handle them. 

00:49:45
PAULA D'ARCY In the early years, my daughter Beth, my surviving child and I were just known as the widow and that little baby, she had after the terrible tragedy. We had a new identity to create which is of, of two people, a mother and a daughter who were really close, who had had yes umm… and early loss that was you know, very affecting. But, as we began to mine that loss for what was really rich in it like, learning to live honestly and learning how precious life was and learning not to let any day, any moment, any word ever pass. We became something, something new which a family that we were really proud of the fact even the richest two of us that we could kind of pick up and go and umm… do things maybe that I in my former life, I would never even have dreamed them. 

00:50:50

PART FIVE 

00:50:55
How to honor and remember your child 

00:51:00
JOE GUAY During the grief process, parents often think about the markers in the life of a child that their child will not experience. It is important to honor these moments throughout the grief journey. 

00:51:10
PAULA D'ARCY There are so many significant moments and as a child would have been like, entering kindergarten at this stage or you know the class in school that your child would have been part of and prom night. Or whatever those markers are, it's to not resist the grief, but to turn toward it and to say, This is a pain that I bear and so I meet this pain and mark it and in this particular way, because those markers will come for years. 

00:51:45
JOE GUAY Many families find creative ways to honor the life of their child. 

00:51:50
KHRIS FORD There are innumerable ways for people to honor their child who's died. And sometimes that's in very overt ways and sometimes it's very quiet, quiet ways. But I do I believe that when we reach outside ourselves and begin to connect with others that healing happens in ways that perhaps it can't when we umm… don't reach out and get beyond our self. 

00:52:15
KELLY PEACOCK We were in the process of building a new church and umm… they have a playground there that's named, "After John," and it's really neat, because when umm… somebody thought of the idea we thought how wonderful you know, all these children would be laughing and running and playing things that John never got to do, and it's so neat to see that that hope and that joy springing up on that playground as kind of a sign of, of his life. 

00:52:40
TANYA MOYA His favorite color was blue. It said about blue ornaments, and that's like the glitter aspect. We got blue lights, but then he saw the musical lights and Jacob love musical lights and so it's half and half. 

00:52:55
CARLENE SOUTH It's a rock that came from school, from the tree planting right there. We have a little umm… garden memorial in the backyard because that's what Benny wanted to do. 

00:53:05
BENNY What about, we asked of tree because the other one. 

00:53:10
CARLENE SOUTH Uh… the other tree? When Meghan died, his school uh… did a beautiful memorial tree planting and put two carved stones, but he wanted to bring one here and do it here. What did you bury? Do you remember? 

00:53:25
BENNY Oh, no. 

00:53:25
CARLENE SOUTH Uh… in the beautiful perfume bottle? 

00:53:30
BENNY No. 

00:53:30
CARLENE SOUTH Some of uh… Moma's… 

00:53:30
BENNY Ashes. 

00:53:35
CARLENE SOUTH …ashes. Mm-hmm! They're under this rock in the perfume bottle deep in the ground, right? 

00:53:40
BENNY Yeah! 

00:53:40
CARLENE SOUTH So, we do all sorts of activities out there, put candles and things like that every day. 

00:53:45
JOE GUAY Other ways to honor and remember include telling stories and speaking the name of the child. 

00:53:55
KHRIS FORD I always encourage families umm… to continue to speak the name of their child. Umm… at whatever level that's comfortable obviously within their family unit to let it be a natural part of life that you are able to say. "Oh, you know, what if, if Stephen had been here, I bet, he would have said this." Or umm… "Do you remember the time when." And I find that when families are able to do that that there is uh… a growth and a sense of movement in the grief. Umm… it's different when families are not able to speak those names umm… and talk about those memories in some way. 

00:54:35
HENRY MOYA We're not afraid to talk about him. We, we involve him in everything that we do. It was a, a period there about, about a month that we looked at each other and we were afraid to say, but then we'd look at each other and said, "Why are we avoiding his presence, you know, 'cause, he's still a part of us." And then we need to you, you know, you need to involve him and, and the more you say it, the, the better you feel. 

00:55:05
VANESSA MOYA I'm wearing his necklace. I wear it for, umm… I wear it for special occasions. When ever I need him, I just wear. 

00:55:20
BILL PEACOCK One ways we talk about John the most in our families William comes up and says, "What would John be doing now?" And, you know, there's a long time ago that we abandoned the reality of John sickness and so when we talk about what John would be doing, we talk about John as if he was just a healthy normal two year old, or three year old, or four year old. And William likes to find out what John would be doing to get in trouble and I think, to have somebody to share the trouble with him. And so that's one ways we get to, just a little bit continue on experience some of those hopes and dreams by, by telling William that the things that John would be doing if he were with us today. 

00:56:05
BENNY This is me and this is my mother. And this is my feeling chart. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN How are you feeling today? 

00:56:10
BENNY Happy. 

00:56:15
PAULA D'ARCY When I was first bereaved, so many people said to me, you'll never get over this. Today, I, I enjoy a life that's, it's so deep and so rich and I see beauty in life in a way then I never thought I would see it again. And in some ways see it even more, because of the honesty that came in looking at what life is really like and being able to accept life as it is and not a dream of life. All of that has conspired to make life very beautiful for me and this is an encouragement, I would want to give to anyone. No, I will never have, not had this experience. But, even with this experience embodied in me, healing was possible. 

00:57:05
KELLY PEACOCK I don't know if I'll ever jump out of bed and say, thank you that, you know, everything's great in the world and, that's okay, I'm okay to get up and say you know, what's, what I need to do today and what's you know, and I can be joyful on that. 

00:57:20
CARLENE SOUTH You wanna go up there and let there (inaudible ). The very preciousness of every single moment of life and I knew that here and I knew that sort of here, but after Meghan died, I really know it in every cell and you know, I wouldn't give up any moment that we had together. Every one of them precious and every moment now is so precious. 

00:57:55
HENRY MOYA It doesn't last forever, just dwell on the things that were good and remember 'em not as a, as a word the last time you saw 'em. I had the good feeling of looking at him as they lived and not as they died. 

00:58:10
CHRIS FORD This is the choice we have. That we can choose to be more, or we can choose to be less. And it really is in our hands. Umm… and we can simply meet it as Paul said, move toward it and allow it to change us in the ways that umm… are only possible I think, after being broken.
