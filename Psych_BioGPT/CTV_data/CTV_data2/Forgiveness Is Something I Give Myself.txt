DR ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in trauma recovery, right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm to the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is forgiveness is something I give myself. With something really bad habits and let's be honest, bad habits in everyone's lives. We all lose people and we all experience struggles and pain. When something truly bad happens, we can hold on to that anger and anguish for the rest of our lives. And if we do this then whatever was that happened or whoever was that hurt us, they continue to win. Some of the most inspiring individuals, I've ever worked with have taught me about what it means to really let go and release the pain of the past. Consider Sheila and Ben they left their precious six-month-old child with a babysitter, child was unattended for only a few minutes in the bathtub and died tragically. How does a person or a couple reconcile such an event or even move on? This is something that requires deeper sense of release and it asks us to find a place within inside of yourselves, where letting go is even a possibility. Sometimes we have to practice letting go for many days, many months and even many years, before we can be released of the burden of caring, anger, hurt and pain. Sheila and Ben showed me what was possible even in deepest pain and suffering. They demonstrated the possibility of road beyond traumatic loss by practicing daily, a sense of surrender to what it is. What resulted was a deliberate practice of release from their terrible pain and suffering in the loss of their infant child. They both told me that holding on to their anger towards the babysitter just got in the way of healing from their own loss. They explained that anger for them had many layers including the layer of anger and self-hatred. This was at the root of their pain. They shared the worst part of all of this, was choosing a babysitter, who was in the end, not careful or attentive enough for resulting in a terrible a tragic outcome. Sheila and Ben explained that after letting go their anger towards the babysitter then working on letting go of the anger, towards themselves for what they could not have known or anticipating would have occurred. Let's practice together. "I know that this anger, pain and hurt remains alive, and that person it continues to injure the most is me. I'm working slowly and gently everyday to let this go, as I understand that as long as I hold onto it, the internal anger injures me most of all. Right now, I'm asking myself what I can do to release the anger, hurt and pain?" Allow for a moment of silence while you reflect.

DR ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Then repeat. "I know that this anger, pain and hurt remains alive, and that the person it continues to hurt and injure the most is me. I'm working slowly and gently everyday to let this go as I understand that as long as I hold on to it, the internal anger injures me most of all. Right now I'm asking myself to do what I can do, to release the anger, hurt the pain?" Recognize that letting go is a process, and that it happens over time. Don't get wrapped up in how long it's going to take, but rather allow release to occur over time with regular practice. Practice this again throughout the day, whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow have a gentle day.
