00:00:20
AMANDA LAMBROS Um... Looking... Welcome to "Helping Clients Move Beyond Grief." I was kinda told to stand up there so they could video me properly but I'm a little more interactive than that so I'm going to move slowly so that he can video me properly. Um... Welcome to "Helping Clients Move Beyond Grief." My name's Amanda Lambros and I am the Executive Director of Grief Recovery Methods Australia, New Zealand. I'm also a certified Grief Recovery specialist. So, today is going to be a little bit of an experiential workshop. So hopefully, you don't mind participating on some level. What we're gonna do over the next 90 minutes is go through a few things with regard to grief and loss. Some things that you may already know, some things that may be new to you. The origin of Grief Recovery Method, different types of loss and we're gonna, uh, uncover some tangible and intangible losses. Also, correct information and myths. Uh... grief by different names - there's numerous names for grief, um, depending on where you're from, cultural backgrounds. STERBs, which are possibly my favorite thing about grief and loss. Um... and now the fact that we don't really necessarily as a society acknowledge grief so here's a different way of us actually acknowledging grief. And then, hopes, dreams, and expectations, which is another way of looking at things, usually when someone passes. We have all these hopes, dreams, and expectations, un-communicated conversations that we would have liked to have with them and we're gonna be, basically, looking at that as well. Okay! You have just received... where is it? Thanks, hon. You've just received a little card like this that says Grief Recovery Method. On the back of it, just draw a line down the middle. It's pretty easy. Not asking too much of you just yet. 

00:02:10
[laughter] 

00:02:15
AMANDA LAMBROS We're getting there though. 

00:02:15
[laughter] 

00:02:15
AMANDA LAMBROS So, just draw a line down the middle. On the right-hand side, divide that side, that half, by two. So, draw a line across like this - similar to what's up on the PowerPoint slide. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN On the right-hand side? 

00:02:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Yeah, on the right-hand side. So, it'll just be like... Oh, sorry. On the left-hand side. Oh, this is gonna be weird! Me presenting this... I'm whichever side it doesn't wor-, it doesn't matter. It's your card. 

00:02:40
[laughter] 

00:02:40
AMANDA LAMBROS So on one side, you want two boxes. On the other side, you kinda want one box, basically. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN Like this? 

00:02:50
Use a blank piece of paper to participate in this exercise 

00:02:50
AMANDA LAMBROS On the one side, you want your biggest loss. So I just want you to take a moment. Close your eyes. Some of you might not even have to think that long about it. But what was your biggest loss? And just write down, actually, what your biggest loss was. Obviously, grief is a unique experience. So, there could be a lot of different losses that you've experienced. 

00:03:15
[sil.] 

00:03:20
AMANDA LAMBROS Now that you've written down your biggest loss, I want you to then to write down your definition of what loss or grief is. And we have a lot of professional people in here who might be going, "I remember what that textbook said it was!" (laughing) I don't necessarily want the textbook definition, I'd like your definition of grief or loss. 

00:03:45
[sil.] 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Oh, good luck! 

00:04:15
The Grief Recovery Method ® By the Grief Recovery Institute® GRM Questionnaire • Who here works with loss? • Take 5 minutes and complete the questionnaire • Ever experienced any loss? • Do you have clients who have experienced loss? © Amanda Lambros, 2012 - Grief Recovery Method Pty Ltd. - info@griefrecoverymethod.com.au 

00:04:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Everyone good? Everyone have a, a loss that they experienced and their own definition? Wonderful! Okay. Next, you have the Grief Recovery questionnaire. So this is a 19 question questionnaire. This is usually what we send out into the community. So, if I'm going to do community talks, um, or doing training with different organizations, we usually send this out because sometimes we get told, "Oh, we don't... we haven't experienced a loss. No one in our organization has died this year." And I say, "Well, you know, death isn't necessarily the only loss. There's quite a few different losses." So all I would suggest is that you go through the questionnaire. Complete the questionnaire and understand the different forms or various forms of loss that may occur. So, these are all for you. But take the time to actually read each, through each question and answer yes or no as to whether or not you've experienced those in your lifetime. 

00:05:15
[sil.] 

00:05:15
Grief Recovery Method Questionnaire 1. Did you move more than twice before the age of 10? 2. Did you ever have a pet die? 3. Did you ever have early childhood religious training? 4. Have you experienced a major change in financial conditions? (Positive or Negative) 5. Have you ever quit a job? Have you ever been fired? 6. Have you ever been married or divorced? 7. Did you graduate from high school? ...from college? 8. Have you experienced the death of a close family member? 9. Have you experienced the death of a distant family member? 10. Were you physically abused during childhood? ...as an adult? 11. Were you sexually abused during childhood? ...as an adult? 12. Have you ever been involved with a miscarriage, Stillbirth, or abortion? 13. Do you have a strained or painful relationship with a living parent(s), spouse, or friend? 14. Do you harbor any resentments or ill-feelings toward a deceased parent(s), spouse, friend, or relative? 15. Have you ever experienced the loss of the use or function of any part of your body? 16. Have you ever experienced the death of a spouse? 17. Are there long stretches of your childhood that you cannot remember? 18. Have you experienced a series of illnesses or accidents? 19. Have you been involved in long series of unsuccessful relationships? 

00:06:55
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. Grief Recovery doesn't believe in comparing losses. So, I wouldn't say, "Oh, all those who've experienced two of 'em, put your hand up. All those who've experienced 20 of 'em, put your hand up." We don't typically do that because everyone's loss is unique. So regardless if you've had one or 30 losses, the way in which you experience those losses are unique to you. You could have a sister and both you and your sister experience the passing of your dad. Those two losses are completely different based on the relationship that you each had with your dad and how you experienced the loss and incorporated that into your lifestyle. So we typically do not compare losses, especially in grief recovery. But what we do wanna show is that there's so many different facets of our life that grief do touch. So, hands up here for an easy one. I am gonna ask if anyone's had this - had a pet pass away? Okay. So, at some level, you've all had a loss. Um... Anyone here ever move house? Okay, good. So I'm on a good basis here. It, I think with those two questions, I've hit everyone in this room so that's good. That's good to know that at least everyone in this room has had one loss. So... Who here works with loss? Grief and loss in their practice? Hmm... Okay. I would actually argue anyone who didn't put up their hand that you all technically work with grief and loss. I've had a practice for 14 years focusing on grief and loss and relationships. And usually, when I present, I say, "Grief and loss and relationships, to me, are identical." Because when you go into a relationship, it's actually a loss. You're no longer just an individual person. As much as it might be an exciting and happy relationship, you're no longer that one individual person who can be spontaneous and go on vacation if you want to. You kinda usually have to take into consideration the other person you've gone into that relationship with. When you're getting out of a relationship, there's also, obviously, a loss that's associated with that. So, for me, relationship counseling is just a me-, just as much about grief and loss as it is anything else. And communication's obviously a big part of that. So, we've done the questionnaire. Ever experienced any loss? Prior to looking at the questionnaire, would your description of loss only have included death? No? Wonderful! This is a good group of people! So, for the fact that your definition of loss doesn't include just death and that it actually looks at tangible and intangibles, um, that's a really good starting point. Because if you're narrow-minded on the idea of grief and loss and say, "Well, it only covers death," there's a lot of other things that you'd be missing in your practice. Do you have clients who have e-, ever experienced loss and specifically come to you about a loss? Yup? Okay. And I know you. So I know that yours are tangible and intangibles. Um... Yeah, yours is... Yeah, yours is loss so I can't go with you. Did you have your hand up? 

00:10:10
GARY Yeah. 

00:10:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. So you've had clients come to you and say... Hi, what's your name? 

00:10:15
GARY Gary. 

00:10:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Gary. "Hi, Gary! My name's Amanda and I'm coming to you because I wanna talk about..." W-what did they say? 

00:10:20
GARY Oh, um... A woman had lost her husband, her dad, and other people. About 45 years of marriage. 

00:10:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. So did he walk off into bushland and get lost? Or did he die? 

00:10:35
GARY No, I think he died. 

00:10:40
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay, so he died after 45 years of marriage? 

00:10:40
GARY Yeah.

00:10:40
AMANDA LAMBROS Wow. Okay. So, that's one of those things that someone comes in and says, "I've lost my partner." "Oh, where'd he go?" "He's passed away... He's died." So we do have a lot of different names for loss. Um... and it's usually we use those names based on what we're comfortable with and what we're habituated to actually know. So if everyone else in the family says "It was a loss"? Yeah, then it was a loss. Because that's the language you know in your family, to actually be able to incorporate that. Origins of Grief Recovery Method. So, I'm gonna tell you a little bit, um, of this. Single most off-limit topic of conversation? What do you think the single most off-limit topic of conversation is? 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN Religion. 

00:11:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Religion? That's a, that's actually a pretty good one I would say. (laughing) Politics, lately. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Hunting. 

00:11:35
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. Usually, we're happy to talk about death. We're happy to say, "So-and so died" or you know. We're usually happy to express death. We're also usually happy to express feelings. That's why most of you have professions because they come in and they tell you how they feel. But usually your reaction to the grief is what you're usually not allowed to talk about. And it's become, unfortunately, blatantly obvious in the D.S.M.-5 because now, grief is actually a diagnosable issue. Which basically says, "Please do not express your emotions associated with whatever grief you're experiencing because if you do and you do it long enough, we should medicate you." Which, to me, I'm a little bit against that. Because there shouldn't be a time limit of "I'm sorry, you're only allowed to cry for three days now or we're medicating you." Um... Or "I'm sorry you chose to wail," because certain cultures choose to wail, "because you've chosen to wail, you should be medicated." So, to me, the reactions of grief is usually one of the biggest things that we're not allowed to talk about. So the story of John James... So I'm gonna take a minute and tell you about Grief Recovery. Grief Recovery Method started in California, in the U.S.A. 35 years ago by a na-, meh-, ugh! A man named John James. John James wrote this book. He wrote this book 32 years ago and the reason he wrote this book was because him and his wife had had a child and tha-, and when the child was three days old, the child died. So being a young man, what did the doctor say to him and his wife? 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Told him to have another one. 

00:13:15

00:13:15
AMANDA LAMBROS "Go home and have another one." Pretty damn close to what he got. Was, "Don't worry. You're young enough. You're obviously fertile. You'll be able to go home and have more children." At that time, John didn't want more children. John wanted his son who had passed away. So, at that time, John had experienced numerous losses throughout his life. He was a Vietnam vet, um, so he had fought in that. He came home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder... And after the death of his son and after hearing the information that he did from the hospital staff, which is, you know, a nice helping hospital staff, who were only doing the best that they knew how to do. So they gave him information that they were skilled with to say, "Don't worry. You'll be able to have more children." So, he decided to go down to a beach in California and to take one of his guns that he had from home because he was a vet and American. And so, he had a gun available to him and he actually put the gun in his mouth. And I'm really, really glad that for some split second, he actually stood there and thought, "Why am I doing this?" He had had the experience of his dad dying. He had the experience of his brother dying and now his son had died. And he thought, "What about my son dying has hit me so hard that didn't hit me quite the same as my dad and my brother?" And that moment, that split second of reflection, that's what he decided to then start dedicating his life towards Grief Recovery and looking at all the different modalities of "why did my son dying, why did that affect me differently than all these other losses I've experienced?" So, John went on a path, I'll say, of understanding why it was that this hit him the most. And so, he ended up finding out that there was... It started with four myths. So there was four main myths that he ended up coming up with and he was like, "Oh my god! These are the things that are really unhelpful." Everyone in society says them because they think they're being helpful when they say them but in reality, they're extremely unhelpful. They're doing 'em and they're s-, they're kinda being nice friends when they're saying it but they're really unhelpful. We will get to those myths eventually. Few years later... So John wrote the initial book with four myths. A few years later, he met Russell Friedman who's now the second author on all of the books and also, uh, the Executive Director of Grief Recovery in the U.S. And what he's done is he's added two more myths. Because once he heard some of the losses that Russell had experienced, they said, "Oh yeah, there are six." So they came up with the six myths and the entire book revolves around six myths. Now, there's a few different ways you can do this. You can just get the book. Anyone can get the book. It's available on... everywhere, like Amazon, Booktopia, all those kinda book places. Um... and you can do the whole program! The whole program is in the one book. Um... So, it's one of those cool things that they wanted to be able to distribute as much information to the widest population possible. And I will show you a video of, um, John James later as well. So, because of John, we now have Grief Recovery Method. So he's been now practicing this for 35 years - 32 years. Um... and it's now branched out into different parts of the world. So, it's in Canada. It's in Mexico, Netherlands, the U.K., a few other places. And we're finally now bringing it to Australia because obviously there's a need here. Okay, so my story. Um... I've been registered as a clinical counselor level four with A.C.A. for years. And part of, uh, their system of bringing the colleges on board and stuff like that was that you needed specific, uh, professional development in the area that you chose to be in. So, one of my areas was grief and loss and I thought, "Well, okay. I'm gonna have to do professional development around grief and loss." So, I had done a few in Australia and then I started branching out and thought, "Okay, I wanna do something different. I wanna do something else." So, I found the book like most people do - on Google. I, like, typed in "grief programs," uh, on Google and found the book and I thought, "Okay, well, what the hell, I'll buy the book." So I bought the book, read it, loved it, and went, "Oh my god, this is the training I need to do!" So, I contacted them in the U.S. originally and I said, "So, can you just come over to Australia? Like, it's just a tiny island... You know, quick plane ride." They said, "No, but you can come to L.A." And I went, "Oh, okay." So, I did. I flew over there and I did training and rather than doing my initial training in L.A., I did my training in Toronto, which was kinda cool, um, because it's closer to my hometown. And so, I went up to do the training and John James was the trainer! I was like, "Oh!" So I walk into this room on a Thursday afternoon and there's John James and I'm like, "Hey! You're, you're him!" And he's like, "Yes, I'm John James. I'll be your trainer today." I'm like, "You actually train this stuff? You don't just like tell other people to do it?" And he's like, "No, I train this stuff too." I was like, "Awesome." So, I saw it as, like, just perfect time, perfect place. And I thought, "That is absolutely amazing! I've got the creator of the program training me on it." That you can't get much better than that. I was pretty stoked. So, I found the Grief Recovery Method's book. I then went to do the training and I found John and it was pretty amazing. John is, uh... The best description of him is outback cowboy, say it as it is. He's got a thick accent like this and he just talks to you like this the entire training. And it's awesome. So, I was in training and I have a half-brother. So, my brother and I, we have the same dads, different moms, born 15 years and 1 day apart. So, we were convinced Dad only did one thing once a year because we were only one day apart. Um... So 15 years later, uh, my brother... Oh, or I was born 15 years later after my brother. So, Brian is my brother. Him and I had, uh, we didn't meet till I was 13. Uh... so the first time we met, I was 13 because my parents had separated and I lived with my mom and her new husband and didn't know my, uh, biological dad. Or he didn't wanna know me. So I really didn't connect with my brother until I was a teenager and then, it was great. I was there for his wedding. I was there when my niece was born. Like it was... It was pretty special. Um, and then, I started noticing some of the things that my brother was doing that I thought, "I'm not so happy about the way you're living your life." I was a teenager at the time. And, uh... I thought, "I'm gonna make a moral call on this and I don't want to be involved with you or your life until you rectify that." So, I stopped talking to my brother. Our dad had, had actually died. So, our biological dad died. We were both at the funeral and about two years after my dad died, uh, my biological dad died, we decided to stop talking, my brother and I. So, a few years goes by, maybe eight years or so. And in November, end of November, I get a Facebook message, of course, from my brother that says, "Hey, sis. It's been a really long time. I'm sorry that we haven't been in contact. Would really love to touch base with you. Hopefully, you're in Canada this Christmas so I can see you again. Just letting you know. Love you, Bri." So, of course, I get this message and rather than going, "Aww, how nice! My brother contacted me," I was more like the, "What? How come it took you eight years to conta-, are you joking me?" So, I saw the message, put it away, looked at the message again and my husband walked past and he said, "Are ya gonna write him back? Like, we are going to Canada for Christmas. Are gonna write him back?" I'm like, "I don't know how I feel about it just yet. Like, not in a good mood about this." And he goes, "Okay." I'm like, "Let me just think about it." So, a month goes by - not even a month - a few days go by. We board an airplane to go to Canada for Christmas and on the airplane, I said to my brother, I said, "You know what? I'm gonna-" Or I said to my husband, not my brother. I said to my husband, "Um, I'm gonna contact my brother. I'm gonna reply to Facebook, to Brian and I'm going to say, 'I'm, you know, I'm glad that you actually contacted me. That's pretty cool. Really wanna see you, really wanna connect. I'd love to see my niece and nephew. So, I'm gonna reconnect with you.'" So, we're on an airplane. Obviously, I can't send a Facebook text while I'm on an airplane. I land. Life gets busy. So, I didn't send it then. Few days after I landed, I'm at training with John. So, I'm in Toronto doing training with John and my mom happened to be there too. And I said, "Oh, Mom! I was contacted by Brian the other day and I'm gonna touch base with him and, you know, and rekindle." And she said, "I think that's a brilliant idea." Day two of training, my brother died in a car crash. So, I didn't get that opportunity to write that m-, uh, um, Facebook message back to him and say, "Hey, I really wanna catch up." To me, things happen for a reason. I don't think my brother died for a reason. Um... But I think he died at the perfect time in my life because I was on Grief Recovery training with the founder of the program on day two of my training. And I thought, "What better time for this to actually come into my life?" So, I went through the other few days of training, his four day training. So I went through the full four days of training so... We had, we started training on day two. We had our morning break, like our morning tea break. And I walked out and made myself a coffee and my Facebook kinda went off. So I check it like you do and it said, "Not sure if you know but Brian died in a car crash this morning." And I was like, "What?" So I picked up the phone and I called my ex-sister-in-law and I said, "Did I read correctly what you actually wrote to me?" And she said, "Yeah." And I was like, "Okay." So I went to John and I said, "John, I just need to let you know something. I just found out my brother has died in a car crash this morning." And he said, "Well, then you're in the perfect place." And I actually was. So I continued the training and I did the training and from that experience, I can say this is the most amazing program ever. It has absolutely 100% changed the life that I lead currently and how I actually look at grief and loss within my life. So it's allowed me to take an absolutely horrible situation and change it. I've then also decided to incorporate this into my training with all of my clients when I see them one-on-one. Once you train in it, you then have the ability to actually run outreach groups and you can also do one-on-one. Okay. What types of losses are there? Shout 'em out. What do you think there are for losses? 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN Loss of children, loss of parents, loss of jobs, loss of pets. 

00:24:00
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay, I love-, wait, one at a time! I've got to repeat this - they're recording this! So, loss of children, loss of parents, lots of-, loss of pets... 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Loss of par-, um, ca-careers. 

00:24:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Loss of careers. Anyone else? 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Loss of your independence. 

00:24:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Loss of independence. That's a great one. Yup. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Friendships. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Lost opportunities. 

00:24:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Lost opportunities, someone said that. That was fabulous. Lost opportunity, loss of friendships... 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN Lost ability... Loss of ability. 

00:24:25
AMANDA LAMBROS Loss of mobility is a huge one, absolutely. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Ability. 

00:24:25
AMANDA LAMBROS Ability? Yup. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Loss of homes? 

00:24:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Loss of homes. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Injury. 

00:24:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Loss of health, that's a big one. Absolutely. Loss of memory, especially in parents or nowadays younger people who are experiencing Alzheimer's is another huge issue. 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Loss of their body parts. 

00:24:40
AMANDA LAMBROS Loss of a body part... Yes, for a lot of different reasons. So, death of a loved one, death of a less than loved one - anyone want to take a, a guess at what "death of a less than loved one" is? 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN Ex-husband. 

00:24:55
AMANDA LAMBROS An ex-husband! 

00:24:55
[laughter] 

00:24:55
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay! (laughing) That is one way of looking at it. Um... Yeah. So death of a loved one is one of those really difficult things to say. If you're having a conversation with someone and you say, "Oh, did you lose a loved one?" And you go, "No, actually. I didn't really love 'em but they did die." That would be death of less than a loved one. So it might have been an ex-husband. Uh... It might have also been a parent or a partner who beat you. So it mighta been a neglectful or an abusive relationship so there may have been a less than a loved one connotation to that. Any accidents? That's a, that's a huge one. Moving? Big, especially in Australia. I'll show you some moving statistics in Australia. Australia is definitely mobile. Uh... Relationships, like I said earlier, the start and the end of relationships is a huge thing. Financial, 'specially when we had the global financial crisis and now there's the dipping up and down of our, uh, financial status. Loss of trust, uh... especially in God, in parents, in partners... Loss of trust in general is a very big one that's difficult to recover from. When I see couples in my couples counseling, usually loss of trust is a big one when there's been an affair. How do I get that trust back in my partner now that I know that they've had an affair? And there's about 40 more so the list goes on. And I honestly think there's well beyond 40 more. I think there's probably a few 100 more. Because everyone can experience loss differently and your interpretation of that loss is gonna be unique. And so what may be a loss for one person may not be a loss for another and vice versa. So, why do clients come to you?

UNKNOWN They're not coping... uh, with the change. 

00:26:50
AMANDA LAMBROS Not coping with the change. Yup. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN 'Cuz some come to you prob-,... Some come to you with the expectation that you'll fix it for them. 

00:27:00
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh, the expectation that you'll fix it! That you have the magic wand or the magic pill, which now... D.S.M-4 or D.S.M.-5 thinks we do have the magic pill, which we don't. So, yes - magic wand or magic pill that you are that sorcerer who can do that. Yup. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Need someone to talk to. 

00:27:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Say that again? 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN Need someone to talk to. 

00:27:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Need somebody else to talk to. Absolutely. 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN Other side effects of, um, grief such as depression and anger. 

00:27:25
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. So, other side effects of grief - so, depression or anger. So, their hearts are broken. They're not coming to you 'cuz their heads are broken. They're literally coming to you 'cuz their hearts are broken and they don't know who to talk to about it. Think about it. You have your best friend and you say, "Hey, come and grab me for a cup of coffee. Awesome." So, you start talking to your best friend of the loss or the death that you've just experienced. What does your best friend say to you? 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN You'll be okay. 

00:27:55
AMANDA LAMBROS "It'll be okay." Yup, yup. "Don't worry, it'll be okay." 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN Thought you'd be over it by now. 

00:28:00
AMANDA LAMBROS Ooh, that's a good one! "I thought you'd be over it by now." Yup. 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN I've already heard this. 

00:28:05
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh! Yeah. That... 

00:28:05
[laughter] 

00:28:10
AMANDA LAMBROS "I've already heard this." That's a really supportive friend. Um... "I've already heard this. Like, you just keep going over this over and over and over." So, absolutely. "I thought I've already heard this before." So, nothing else has worked. They have come to you because you are the last ditch effort. They've bought the books. They've, you know, done some program. They've gone to some group. They've done, kind of, everything. They've gone to Google and tried to magic wand themselves on Google or something like that. They have done a lot of things. Joined a blog, gone onto a Facebook group, heaps of things. Nothing else has worked so they have come to you. They're also not sure what else to do. "I hate feeling like this. Fix me. Make me feel how I felt prior to this occurring. So, do something with this." Someone else told them to come see you, which is that friend who says, "Hey, I've heard that before. I don't wanna hear this anymore. Go and talk to a counselor. And pay somebody else, like a counselor, to listen to you. Because I don't wanna hear it anymore." So, literally, somebody else has said, "Go and seek help." Um... And sometimes, they're there because they legitimately wanna be there but also, they might be there because someone else has forced them to come. "I'm forcing you into that chair to talk to somebody else so that it's not me that you have to talk to." Does this sound familiar? 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN Yeah.

The Grief Recovery Method ® By the Grief Recovery Institute® The 6 Myths • Don't feel bad • Replace the loss • Grieve alone • Grief just takes time...'time heals' • Be strong for others • Keep busy © Amanda Lambros, 2012 - Grief Recovery Method Pty Ltd. - info@griefrecoverymethod.com.au 

00:29:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. Just to make sure we're all on the same page here. They thought it was "time" or it was "long enough." So, their partner had died 20 years ago. It's been 20 years. Time was supposed to heal it. Maybe it did. Maybe it didn't. It's been long enough. "I've had this-, I've felt that pain for 20 years. Now can you fix it?" So, they've had that experience long enough and now they're coming to you. However, they all have one thing. Regardless of the reason that they have chosen to come and see you, they all - 100% of 'em - are experiencing one thing. This is an incomplete emotional communication that sustains unresolved grief. Those are the "I wish I coulda, shoulda, done a, woulda... while they were there." And for some reason, they're no longer there. Whatever it might be - it might be a divorce, it might be a relocation, it might actually be a death and "I no longer have that ability to communicate those emotions or that communication to them anymore." So, I have this space called "unresolved grief." Does that make sense? Okay. So, incomplete emotional communication that sustains unresolved grief because if they didn't have that, they wouldn't be comin' to see you. It'd be pretty easy. They wouldn't be walking through your door. Okay. So, now we're gonna get to the fun part - the six myths. Just kinda give a, a nod or a "Yeah, uh-huh..." whatever if these apply to any loss you've ever experienced... So, any loss at all - think through your myriad of losses you may have experienced, loss and death and grief - the whole gamut. Think of all of those and see if any of these apply because you've been told this or you've believed this during one of those experiences. "Don't feel bad." 

00:31:25
[laughter] 

00:31:25
AMANDA LAMBROS "They had it coming." "Don't feel bad. They had a long life." Hmm! 'Kay! Replace the loss. "Our goldfish died!" "That's okay! We'll go to the fish store today and get a new one." "You'll get another boyfriend! Plenty of fish in the sea!" 

00:31:50
[laughter] 

00:31:50
AMANDA LAMBROS Right? So, replace the loss. Whatever was there is no longer there. Replace it with something else. Anyone experience this one? Grieve alone. A child was told once that their grandfather had died. They were in school and school gets the call. "Just to let you know, Johnny's grandpa died." So, what does school principal do? Over the loudspeaker, says, "Johnny, can you please come to the principal's office?" Johnny does his thing, you know, thinks, "Oh my god, I'm in trouble. Oh my god! What did I do?" Gets to the principal's office. Principal goes, "I just wanna let you know something. We just got a call. Your grandpa died. Your mom's coming to pick you up. So, just sit here in my office. Here's a box of tissues. And when your mom gets here, we'll let you know." And walks away. So, it's okay to grieve alone. Just grieve alone. Rather than, "I'll give you a hug. We'll think this through. We can talk about it." So, just, you know, "Grieve alone in my office." Why do people, like, grieve alone? Why is this a myth? Why is this a, one that we probably shouldn't do? 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN Nobody knows how to help. 

00:33:05
AMANDA LAMBROS Nobody knows how to help them. Exactly. What are you supposed to say? "Ugh! This is a really uncomfortable conversation I'm about to have. So, I'll just avoid having it with them by leaving them alone." And that's usually where grieve alone stems from. Grief just takes time or time heals. "It's really sad that grandma died but don't worry. You'll get over it in a few years." That's probably one of the worst ones that I've heard was, um, unfortunately, a case in W.A. And it was a husband and wife and the husband had passed away from cancer. And the wife went to the Palliative Care Bereavement specialist in the hospital. And he said, "Don't worry. You'll be able to get over the loss of your husband soon." And she said, "I don't wanna get over the loss of my husband. He was an integral part of my life." And then she walked out and came and saw me, (laughing) which I was thankful for! But I was really amazed that someone said, "Don't worry. You'll get over it." Be strong for others. You've experienced a loss or grief and you are dying inside. But you are meant to be strong for everyone else. Be strong for your kids. Be strong for your fellow cousins or your brothers and sisters. "You're the oldest in the family. Be strong for everyone else. Show face." Ever hear this? Oh, you... Oh! Pshoo! (laughing) Yup. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Like, he was only your uncle. Now, think about his wife and kids. 

00:34:35
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh, that's a good one! "He was only your uncle. Think about his wife and kids." 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, why are you crying so hard? 

00:34:40
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. "Why are you crying so hard?" Absolutely. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN ...cry. 

00:34:45
AMANDA LAMBROS So, they came up with some good ones. And the last one... Keep busy. So, you know... "Oh, just... Let's join the bridge club" and "let's go on vacation" and "let's keep doing you know what we're doing" or "take on some more hours at work" or "let's just keep doing" rather than actually having the moment to sit down and think about the emotional issues associated with the loss or the grief. Right? So, do any of these ring true? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Totally. 

00:35:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Or at least a few of them? I'm thinking more than one of 'em possibly rings true, if you're like the general population... 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN All of them. 

00:35:20
The Grief Recovery Method ® By the Grief Recovery Institute® My biggest loss is/was What MYTHS were you told/Did you experience? My definition of loss is LEAVE BLANK FOR NOW © Amanda Lambros, 2012 - Grief Recovery Method Pty Ltd. - info@griefrecoverymethod.com.au 

00:35:20
AMANDA LAMBROS All of them? Yup. (laughing) Okay. I would have said all of 'em as well. But, um... And it, you know... Now that this has been a, kinda expanded into different countries, we've actually found that the trainers in all the different countries, when we come back with this information to head office in L.A., we say, "Yeah, they work. They work in all the countries. Everyone, regardless of cultural, religious, language barriers, everyone typically agrees with the six." So, they've hit the nail on the head with those six. Um... And there's a lot of different ways that we express these. And I'm sure you all have your own, like, family sayings or stuff that support one of these. That it may not be direct word for word on this but, like, "Chin up." Or "man up" or "toughen up, princess!" That's... Ah, that's a good one! That would be the big-, be strong for others. (laughing) So, yeah. There's a different way of being able to say it but really, it means the same thing. Okay. So now, back to your cards. So, on the other side of your card... So you already have your biggest loss. You already have your definition of a loss or grief. Now, on the other side, what myths did you experience? So, what were some of the things, apart from my list of six, my six hit list, what were some of the things that you were told? So, like the "toughen up, princess." Or the "plenty of fish in the sea." 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN She was old. 

00:36:45
AMANDA LAMBROS "She was old." 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN She was so old, it was better... 

00:36:50
AMANDA LAMBROS So, like a justification. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:36:50
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN I wasn't grieving her dying. I was grieving the way she died. 

00:36:55
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN So I cried all up until she died. Once she died, I just felt the way, it's... I wasn't expecting that. I was expecting her just to go to sleep and... But it wasn't. 

00:37:05
AMANDA LAMBROS So, there was a, a, like a, a longer duration for you? 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Witnessing that. 

00:37:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN So... Not... 

00:37:15
AMANDA LAMBROS And what was the message you received around it? 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Um, you know, she, she's peaceful now. 

00:37:20
AMANDA LAMBROS She's at rest now. She's peaceful... 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN In fact, I stopped my brother putting on the gravestone "died peacefully." 

00:37:25
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Because, to me, it wasn't. 

00:37:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Once my mum died, I felt... not say, happy. But... 

00:37:35
AMANDA LAMBROS Maybe a sense of relief? Or a lifting of a weight? 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN But I didn't cry but I cried leading up to it. 

00:37:40
AMANDA LAMBROS And you know what? That's totally individualistic and unique. And then, someone else like your brother - because you did mention you have a brother - so, someone like your brother, in the loss or the death of your mother, might have felt completely different. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:37:50
AMANDA LAMBROS And that's totally fine. But typically, when there is a loss in a family or a death in a family and there's a few kids... Like, we'll go with three kids because for some reason, my couples seem to get divorced when they have three kids. So, they come to me. They're going through divorce and they're like, "How do we talk to our kids about it? 'Cuz each one of our kids, like... This is what we told them..." So they gave 'em a blanket explanation but all the kids are at different stages. So all the kids are at different learning stages and developmental stages so that the blanket conversation they had with them didn't quite hit all the kids the right way. Because they hope that all the kids would experience the grief the same way. So they would all get the fact that Mommy and Daddy were no longer living together and that now these kids had to live between two houses. So, they said, "You know, they're all gonna have the same experience." And I said, "No, they're not. They're all gonna have individual, unique experiences based on how they felt about that relationship and each one of you and how they continue to have that relationship with you." So, everyone's got a few myths on your card? Yup. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Yes, um, not only I was taught that. It was... sorta to go back to, to (inaudible)

00:39:05
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh, that's what I'm gonna get on to next. That's called the, uh, Academy Award performance. Yes, actually, I think that's the next slide. Oh, it's not the next slide! But it's coming up! That is the Academy Award performance. "I've just put on the smiley face and everything's okay." So, we will definitely touch on that one. So, the name game. This is what I call the grief and loss name game. This is kinda like Jeopardy. Um... There's so many things people come in to you and they might not say, "I have experienced a loss of trust. Can you please help me?" Because we all know, as practicing people in mental health, they may not have the language associated with being able to say, "I have experienced a loss of trust." Um... So, what they do is they say, "Oh, god! I have burn out at work!" Or "I'm going through pressure. So much pressure is building up in my life." Another one, "Stress. Ugh! The amount of stress that I have going on right now..." So they come in with a lot of different ways of looking at it. Free floating anxiety... So, again, a lot of different ways that they may use words to try to express their, their dealing with a grief and loss. Any that you guys might have experienced? That your clients have come in or, or that you've experienced yourself and you're like, "I just don't know how to say, 'I'm feeling crap because so-and-so died' or 'I'm feeling crap because my boyfriend who I thought was gonna get proposing me has left me!'" So, uh, great commercial on T.V. right now that, uh, has a guy and girl in a car and she's like, "So, I was thinking..." and he's like, "Will you marry me?" And she's like, "I was thinking we'd break up." And he's like, "Oh, okay. Yeah, great. Good thing I kept the receipt." And it's kinda that situation of, you know, being able to actually say what's on your mind and not being able to. So I think that commercial kinda, you know, it brings it home. (laughing) Um... So, any name games that you guys have heard from yourselves or your clients?

00:41:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Fatigued, tired. Yup. I have a lot that have gone to see psychiatrists and just said, "I'm feeling really depressed." Without possibly a good enough, um, history or an assessment of it to actually realize that that "depressed" state or that "not feeling so great" or "feeling blue" or "feeling sad often" was actually directly related to a loss that they experienced. So, unfortunately, medicalization comes into that. Signs of grieving - I love this! Signs of grieving, give me a break! Um... Signs of grieving - out of time. So, they're out of time, they're rushed for a lot of things. Drains you of energy... Closes your heart so that you're not able to continue to love again. So, I've had my heart broken so many times that I'm just not going to be able to love again. Protect ourselves by not loving again. That kinda goes with "closes your heart." Limits our loving exposure thereby dooming the new relationship to fail? Um... (laughs) I love this one because they've written another book. So after the fabulous Grief Recovery handbook, they were noticing a lot of relationships were coming in. Surprise, surprise! And this is the "Moving On" book and with the "Moving On" book... So, it says "Moving On: Dump your relationship baggage and make room for the love of your life." And it's literally, and I think the term here in Australia is, um, excess baggage? That you have one relationship, you get out of that relationship, you kinda bring some of that baggage along with you to the next one... And then that relationship breaks down somehow and you bring the baggage from both of those into your next one and then, that relationship breaks down. And you're kinda like, "What's the same common denominator here?" It wouldn't be the relationships. It's what you're bringing to that relationship and how you're coping with that relationship. So, I love that book for my relationship couples. I kinda, like, if they're just going through a, a divorce or a break up or, you know, some "My heart has been ripped out of my chest!" kinda conversation, I hand them that book. I say, "Have a read of this. Come and see me next week." Um... And they actually quite like it. They come back. They're like, "I love this book. Thank you so much." So, limiting your relationships... Hide true feelings for fear of being judged? Nothing worse than... Oh, my big thing! My grandmother, um, died when I was in my early 20s, late teens, early 20s. And she used to wear Chantilly lace, um, like perfume or body lotion and if you've ever smelled Chantilly lace, you know the smell. And I was walking through a mall one day and - like, I think Chantilly lace was designed in the 1930s so it's not like everyone nowadays wears it like eau de toilette, whatever, it's Chantilly lace from back in the day. And I was walking through the mall and I got this whiff and I was like, "Oh my god, that's Chantilly lace! Oh, where is it?" You know? And I started looking around. Was there a little old lady in the shopping mall who was wearing Chantilly lace? 'Cuz I'm sure no 15 year old's running around with Chantilly lace on. And I was kinda like looking around in a... And they were selling it in the original, like, pink bottle at the pharmacy! And I was like, "I think I need to buy that." And my husband went, "You need to do what?" I'm like, "I think I need to buy that. Not like the big container or anything but like just a small one that I could just open and sniff every now and then." And he's like, "It reminds you of your grandma that much?" I went, "Actually, it does!" It like blows my mind. It just flooded my memory with so many great memories of my grandma and, you know, her smelling like Chantilly lace. So, if you're having an experience like that, mine was a very joyful experience. So I wasn't afraid to have that emotional expression with my husband in the mall at that time. But if it was something that brought pain or a sad memory to me, I might have stood there and just bawled my eyes out. A family friend of ours, her husband had died. Um... And it was a long, drawn out, uh, death from cancer. 'Bout two months after he had died, we have a very transient population where my parents are from, and so she was shopping in the shopping, like, at Kohl's equivalent. So she was grocery shopping at Kohl's and she had a full, um, ba-, uh, cart full of stuff and someone who she hadn't seen who didn't know her husband had died came up to her and said, "Hey, how's he doing?" And she lost it. She bawled her eyes out. She left. She sat in her car. She locked all the doors and she was like... She was in a state of "I can't do anything. I can't go shopping anymore. I can't leave my house." So, that, for her was a fear of being judged. She didn't want to sit there and start crying in Kohl's saying "I'm really sad" or "I'm still hurting that my husband has died." So she bolted, as quick as she could, so that no one would judge her. So those are the things that you're afraid of being judged or sitting down and having that conversation and saying, "You know, he died but I wasn't really that sad that he died! Like... It kinda sucked. But it didn't really... eh... you know!" And then, someone goes, "But that's your grandpa. You should be sad!" Well, no. Maybe you would be sad if your grandpa died but... this was my grandpa and we weren't that close and, you know, like, he was just my grandpa. So other people do bring into the conversations their opinions and their judgments. Uh... Which you guys all work as mental health prof-, uh, professionals, you don't do that at all! So, it's very difficult for us because we're trained not to do that. But friends aren't trained to keep their mouths shut, uh, when it comes to opinion or judgment. So that can be very, very damning for someone who's just experienced a loss. And isolation. So again, now that she had that experience of someone saying "How's your husband?" and she didn't know how to react to that, she then spent a few months in her house. So she had to order all her groceries in. She refused to go to church. She refused to take part in life. Um... Her grandson was born, she refused to go to the hospital to see her grandson being born. She just wanted to stay at home where she felt his presence. So again, in isolation. And the more you're isolated, the worse the isolation becomes. Because you're really starting to kinda put the walls up and everyone's going, "Oh, don't talk to her! Ugh... You know, it's a really touchy subject. Just kinda stay away until time heals and then you can go and see her." Is this making sense so far? Okay! Short-term emotionally relieving behaviors. We're gonna go through the list and then I'm gonna kinda explain. Well, I'll explain first. Short-Term emotional relieving behaviors - these are the things that we choose to do in our life, and I will say we because all of us do it, that make us feel bad - er, feel better! Not bad. Make us feel better! Just for that split second or moments. Makes you, "Oh! You know, that felt really good." Any ideas of what those might be? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Eating chocolate. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Alcohol. 

00:48:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Chocolate! Alcohol! 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Buying shoes. 

00:48:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Shoes! Someone said shoes! A woman after my own heart! (laughing) Shoes! 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Shopping. 

00:48:20
AMANDA LAMBROS Shopping! 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Pornography. 

00:48:20
AMANDA LAMBROS Pornography. Yup. Absolutely. Sex, academia, eating, alcohol, drugs, sex, cleaning, excessive exercising... I've heard some of the coolest STERBs you could ever imagine. People are like, "Oh yeah, that's what I did." I'm like, "Really?" Um... Sleeping? So excessive amounts of sleeping. Isolation because it actually made them feel better to just get away from everyone. "I didn't want to talk to anyone." So just getting away from them. So these are the things, these are those short-term emotionally relieving behaviors that we do. Hoarding! If you've ever watched one of those odd American shows called Hoarding or Hoarder Masters or whatever those shows are, those are short-term emotionally relieving behaviors that they have adopted that have now become long-term emotionally relieving behaviors. Because they can't even throw out that stuff. They've collected it and they can't even part with that because that now becomes an extension of their losses. So, these are some of the things, I'm sure if you all sat there and thought through a list of... "I know what I do. Oh yeah, I've done that! Well, yeah, uh-huh, okay, I remember when that happened." My family is French-Canadian. We are comfort eaters - comfort eaters, comfort drinkers. You know? Something goes right, we eat. Something goes wrong, we eat. Something goes right, we drink! Something goes wrong, we drink. Something's just neutral, we drink and eat. We are one of those great families that drinks and eat. I think the best thing for my waistline and my curvature hips has been living in Australia because I'm kinda separated from my family. But then I go home for Christmas where we eat and drink. And then I spend from January until November weight-lossing my one month of December. (laughs) So! So, we are a comfort food family. And it's good! When you got good comfort food, you can't go really beyond that. So those are my STERBs. Wha-, and academia is a huge one for me that... Again, that goes with "keep busy." Throw yourself into something else. Do really good at work. Strive at what you do. That would be called the "keep yourself busy" STERB. So, most of these STERBs relate directly with one of the messages, one of the myths that you've received. Were there any others on here? Like, one of my clients actually said hers was exercise. She'd exce-, any time she thought of the loss, she would exer-sive, exercise excessive amounts. Just go to the gym because it made her feel better. Obviously, a release of endorphin so it was a good thing for her. But she said she could spend hours at the gym. Any other ones that you guys wanna? 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN How about painfully focused all their attention on others? 

00:51:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh, yeah! Be strong for others? 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:15
AMANDA LAMBROS So, a re-direction? 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, they, they get themselves involved in everybody else's lives so that they don't think about their own. 

00:51:20
AMANDA LAMBROS Absolutely. So, r-, getting involved in everyone else's life so that they don't have to think about their own? That's a huge one. The minute they actually have to stop and reflect on their life and their loss and actually think about the heart... And this is where I love, I love Grief Recovery. Um, obviously, I'm a bit biased about it but I love Grief Recovery because we do 12 centimeters? Of work. We move people from here to here. We literally move people from being intellectual about whatever loss they experienced to being able to be allowed the space to feel it within their heart and to actually express those emotions that they were kinda told not to previously. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Excuse me, Amanda? 

00:52:05
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup? 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Sorry to... Another one of those STERBs would be, uh, anger. 

00:52:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Anger. Absolutely. Yup. So, lashing out because you... You're looking at a way, something's happened and I want it to make me feel better. So, anger, punching a wall. I've had a client who actually punched a hole through his wall because every time someone asked him about the loss, he didn't wanna talk about it so he punched a hole through the wall. So anger is definitely another way to express it. Yup. Makes you feel great that moment you're doing it and then, afterwards, it actually hasn't resolved anything. Because the loss is still there. The emotions behind the loss are still there. So you can shoe shop all you want. Which I'm very good at. My husband's convinced he's married a centipede. I'm fine with it. Um... (laughing) But I know that that's a, uh, that's a big STERB of mine. Like, if I... Comfort food eating and drinking as well! Um... But shoe shopping? (scoffs) If I'm feeling great or bad, shoe shopping. Absolutely. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Um, excessive T.V. watching. 

00:53:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh yeah! Excessive T.V. watching so the zombie state? Yup. Because you don't really care what's on T.V., you're just like looking. Yup. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN Always, always being running from, from one thing to the next to the next so you don't stop. 

00:53:25
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. Running from one thing to the next so you don't stop. Yup. Another very good "keeping busy" one. Yup. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN Playing music. Not up with the music. Just music. 

00:53:40
AMANDA LAMBROS Just music? 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN No, music... not depressing music but you know, the old love songs and that... 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN B-but! (inaudible ) 

00:53:45
AMANDA LAMBROS Breakup songs. "Oh my god, he broke up with me so now I'm just gonna listen to breakup songs for the rest of the week!" Uh... Doesn't change the fact that he broke up with you...

00:53:55
AMANDA LAMBROS Just means that you have a very large collection of breakup songs. Um... (laughs) Yeah, absolutely. Or re-listening to that song? That song over and over and over again? So health effects - imagine these. Imagine harboring grief and loss, which I'm gonna call it toxin. So let's harbor grief and loss as a toxin in our body. We're gonna harbor that. And what's it gonna do to us? Here's some of the things that research has actually proven it does to us! So, violence - and that's where the anger comes in as well. Addictions. Whoo! Dude, you wanna trace back addictions to its actual root? More than likely, it's some form of grief or loss. Regardless if it's tangible or intangible, I would say probably 99% of addictions you can trace back to a loss. Obesity? That would be because we comfort eat! (laughs) Um... Suicide? Another one. "I just can't deal with these emotions of hearing it over and over again. Or reliving those thoughts or reliving those feelings or... He... Like living with that pain? I can't do it anymore." Suicide. Ulcers? This is a huge one and there's been some great research done in W.A. over this. High blood pressure? Absolutely! I haven't heard of any research that grief causes low blood pressure. Um... But high blood pressure, absolutely, because your vessels constrict. Um... So it actually makes the blood flow more difficult, giving you high blood pressure. High blood pressure also leads to a whole bunch of other things - heart attack, whol-, horrible, nasty, horrible things. Cancer? Obviously, if you're gonna sit there and harbor that much toxin in your body, the cancer's gonna get into those cells. So there's so many other things that occur. These are just the ones that huge studies have done. Like, uh, randomized control trials or systematic reviews have been done to actually prove that these are associated with loss and grief. There's plenty more out there. So if your clients come in... Migraine headaches! That seems to be a really big one for lately that I've seen a lot of my clients - migraine headaches. They come in and they're like, "My head is just throbbing! So, I'm kinda numbing it with Panadol," or whatever they're taking to numb the pain but it's not really going away. And surprisingly, they go through the Grief Recovery Method's process and like by week seven, once they've done the last part of the process, their headaches have stopped. I'm like, "Oh! Hmm... You finally let go of whatever it was you were harboring and now, the headaches have stopped." So there's a lot of different ways of looking at it. Like, were there, was there something that happened? Um, some of the losses, you know there's a triggering effect of, um, glandular fever. So, someone's run down, you're more likely to get other things. If you're run down because you're exhausted or you're not feeling well or whatever it might be or you're not sleeping well... Insomnia? That's another one. So there's a lot of different ways of looking at it. I'm going to have to go up there to play this. This is Nancy. She is, uh, one of our Grief Recovery specialists. Um... and she's a mental health practitioner. 

00:57:15
DR. NANCY WILLINGER Hi, I'm Dr. Nancy Willinger, um, and I'm a therapist in Studio City, California. And about 10 years ago, I took the Grief Recovery Method certification training and it was, it was really, probably, the best training as a, as a therapist I've ever done. It was experiential. I learned so much about myself and about my own losses and it helped me in my, in my work. I, I now run their groups and I also work one-on-one with grievers doing the Grief Recovery work. Um... It, it's, it's really powerful work. It really, um... It helps you discover losses that you, you've, you've kinda buried and you didn't realize that were, were affecting you. And, um... A lot of the people who come into my office are struggling with addiction and I find that many times, underneath, um, that self-medicating is, is, um, unresolved loss. And once someone can access that and through the Grief Recovery Method, there are specific exercises that help you access those losses, those memories that you've kinda buried, that you've cut off, that you don't wanna deal with because we're really never taught to deal with our grief and to, um, to get through it and work through it. Um... And once you do, it can be really freeing. I find that when someone comes in and they're in that acute state of grief, um, the exercises can also be such a relief. Um... It doesn't take away your grief by any means. But, but it can, can really take away of that guilt, that, that, um, that coulda, woulda, shoulda, wish all those things that, that when you've lost someone, especially if you didn't get a chance to say goodbye to that person. Um... I recommend th-the Grief Recovery Method training - the certification program - to my colleagues. I've recommended it to family members. I, I can't speak highly enough about it. It's, um... It's a real game-changer. It's a real... I still go through the exercises myself. Um... Just to keep current and keep, keep, you know... In all relationships, resentments build up. Things build up and this is a concrete way to work through that stuff. And um... I'm grateful that I, I had the opportunity to learn it.

AMANDA LAMBROS So that's Nancy and I wanted to show that to you guys so that you could see, "Ooh, it does work!" Um... So that you could see that, you know, as a mental health practitioner, you may already deal in grief and loss, which most of you actually said that you did. But this is an additional add-on that you can have as an additional toolkit, basically. And for me, working as a counselor for the amount of years I have, I love the fact that I now have something else to add to my toolkit. And it is great once you do it, you actually start incorporating it into your life. Like yo-, continuing to do the, the process throughout your daily life on different people in different relationships you have. So, grief is a normal and natural response to loss. It is not abnormal or unnatural in any way at any level. Typical effects of grief are present everyday. Staring off into space, glazed look into their eyes. So again, zoning out in the T.V. and just watching whatever happens to be on the tube. Um... Tears running down their face. For no reason, they're just sitting there and, you know, tears are running down. And it could be happy tears, it could be sad tears. So there's a lot of different ways of looking at it. And accidents. This is a massive thing. More than likely, the, um, rates of accidents, of "accidental accidents," which I can't even believe they class as "accidental accidents," um, occur because you're gazing off into, you know, space. So, you're driving and you're meant to get from point A to point B and you get to point B and you think, "How the hell did I just get here? God, I must have just drove 36 blocks! I don't remember driving any of it." Or re-focusing on something and then an accident occurs or your mind wanders to somewhere else and you've fallen off the ladder. Or you're just not mentally there when you're using the round-saw and you accidentally cut your finger, um, off. My dad did that - cut his finger off. I was like, "Oh! That's gross!" Um... But those are the things that you're not actually present. And because you're not present, "accidental accidents" are occurring. So, Academy Award recovery? This is the "I'm fine." I love the fact that they have a section in their book called A-, uh, "Academy Award Recovery." Um... They're from California. One of the, um, guys' wife is an actress and she's been to the Academy Awards and he's like, "I know what that looks like. You walk down there with the, the smile..." "Everything's fine! It's great! Yeah, no problem! We're, we're coping just fine!" And then, they go home and how are they coping? 

01:02:30
UNKNOWN They're not. 

01:02:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Yeah, not so fine. (laughs) Absolutely not so fine. So, pain, isolation, loneliness, but usually, it exhibits itself with "I'm fine. My makeup's done. My hair is done. I'm good! I'll still go to P.T.A. meetings and I'll still pick up my kids on time and everything's fine!" But in reality, it's not. 

01:02:50
UNKNOWN Amanda? 

01:02:50
AMANDA LAMBROS Yeah? 

01:02:50
UNKNOWN Is this, uh, back. 

01:02:50
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup! 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN Um... 

01:02:55
AMANDA LAMBROS There you go! 

01:02:55
UNKNOWN Back. 

01:02:55
AMANDA LAMBROS Oh! Back? 

01:03:00
UNKNOWN I suffered from about four years of the zoning. 

01:03:00
AMANDA LAMBROS The zoning, suffered for about four years with zoning. 

01:03:05
UNKNOWN In fact, I was put on Epilen. 

01:03:10
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. So, medicated for zoning. 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN Right. And this was when my son had a massive accident... 

01:03:15
AMANDA LAMBROS Uh-huh. So your son had a ma-massive accident? 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN But he didn't die but... 

01:03:20
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN He changed all our... 

01:03:20
AMANDA LAMBROS The dynamic - it changed the family dynamic. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN And I was forced by many people, zoning, and was medicated. 

01:03:30
AMANDA LAMBROS Uh-huh. 

01:03:30
UNKNOWN In the end, I kept trying to speak to the neurologist and say, "I do not have epilepsy." 

01:03:35
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN 'Cuz I got diagnosed with epilepsy at 60. 

01:03:40
AMANDA LAMBROS So, they're trying to figure out a different reason as to why this was occurring, rather than axel-, actually possibly accepting the fact that your son had an accident. "Well, it's just an accident!" 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN You wouldn't think so. 

01:03:50
AMANDA LAMBROS Yup. 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN So, in the end, I said, "No. I'm sorry. I'm not coming to you and I'm not taking Epilen." 

01:03:55
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay, so... 

01:03:55
UNKNOWN So, and it's, it's okay now. It's gone... 

01:04:00
AMANDA LAMBROS Okay. So y-,... 

01:04:00
UNKNOWN Going on now for four years... 

01:04:00
AMANDA LAMBROS So you're no longer zoning? 

01:04:00
UNKNOWN Zoning.

01:04:00
AMANDA LAMBROS And see? There's no time limit. Someone might zone for a day! Someone might zone for four years! You know? There's no major time limit. So when people say or have just experienced x loss, "When should I get help?" "'Bout five minutes later." That's when you should start getting help on it. The longer you allow it to wait, the worse it's gonna get. Because the longer you allow it to wait, what's happening? You're re-thinking it in your head. Over and over again. Those hopes, dreams, expectations - "Ooh! And there was also this! And there was also... Ooh! And there was that time. God, I really wish I would have done this." So the longer it is, which time heals all, in reality, time makes it kinda worse. Because you have longer to think about whatever it is that was occurring. So, the definition of grief is like reaching out for someone who has always been there, only to find that when I need her one more time, she is no longer there. That is a really good way of being able to describe grief. It's a transition from your normal. So you've had a normal continuum and there's a bump in that continuum. That is grief. That is the definition of grief. So, her son didn't die! He had an accident and there was a change or a shift in the dynamic of the family. That's fine. That is a loss. Because there was that shift or that dynamic, that's a bump along the road. That is a grief and loss experience. So I happen to love this definition. Um... Because it's, you know, wanting to reach out for them one more time and they're not there. And this goes hand-in-hand with whether the person has left because of a relationship breakdown or whether the, the person has died. You know? So it does give you both of those balances. It also works for the intangibles like "I've reached out for my faith and my faith is no longer there." "I've reached out to have trust and trust is no longer there." Significant emotional statements - these are usually those things that we didn't communicate. Those are the left unsaid so hopes, dreams, and expectations. Those are usually the three key points of things that we actually didn't get the opportunity to say. So when you start incorporating Grief Recovery into your daily life, you start to look at it more in a mindful-based approach. That's a nice way of actually saying it that a lot of you will understand, is that you're in the here and now. So if you're in the here and now with a relationship, you'll communicate those hopes, dreams, and expectations to that person. You won't kinda leave that relationship and go, "God, I really wish I would have told 'em that I was really thankful they made me dinner tonight." Or, you know, something like that. You don't leave there with un-communicated information. You actually complete all communication when you actually have the opportunity to do it. "Categories... Where are you?" And this is, um, usually a question I ask my clients. I know it doesn't sound like English up there but I will explain it so it does sound like English. So, "want to want to" - "I really want to want to do it but I'm not really sure." So they're thinking about it. "So I want to want to recover from this" or "I want to want to get rid of this pain" but they're not really sure. "To want to want to" means they want to talk about it. They're at a really good stage. They're really wanting to talk about it at this point. And then, "making a change." To me, those are the three categories. The "I'm not really sure, I'm just kinda thinking about it," the "I absolutely do want to," and the "O-okay, I'm gonna talk about it..." Those are the three categories - think about it, talk about it, do it. If your clients are at the stage that they wanna do it, awesome. That is where it's going to work. Because they are open and ready for the change that will occur. Happy or right? This, I think, is one of the coolest concepts of Grief Recovery Method. You can be happy, which is wonderful. That's kinda something most of us thrive for, strive for. Um... Or you can be right. And if you're right, usually, you're not happy. There's some instances where you can be right and happy at the same time, which is fabulous. But usually there's an issue that you just wanna be right. So you're gonna put your foot down or you're gonna be that, you know, bull-headed, stubborn, blah, blah, blah... "But I am right!" Does right make ya feel any better? No. It doesn't make you feel happy. So it's understanding what you choose to do with that relationship and how you move on beyond that. So, right or happy is a very, very cool concept. Um... The alternative of just being right, uh, is living a very limited life. Because if you're just right, then you can't actually see happy. Whereas if you're willing to let go of just being right and just kinda, you know, water off the duck's back type situation, then you'll have the opportunity to be happy. Grief is everywhere. So, here's some... I've decided to bring in some Australian statistics for you guys! Uh, last, uh, 20-11... So, 2011, there was a hund-, 146,936 total deaths in Australia. So, I would say a few families are grieving. Of, uh, of those, there was 1,140 total infant deaths. So, I'd say now, instead of just one person grieving, there's probably two people grieving, if not a family structure that would be grieving. So, now we've just kinda increased our client base population by a lot. According to the 2007, 2008 A.B.S. Survey of Income and Housing, 43% of Australians population had moved in the last five years. So anyone who had moved in the last five years, they've lost, they potentially lost relationships. They might have moved because of financial hardship. They might have moved because of a divorce. They might have lost their, you know, best friend who used to live next door to them and they don't live there anymore. Um... They may have had to have, uh, downgraded their house because of the global financial crisis. 46% have moved once. So this is within the last five years stat. So, 46% moved once, 19 moved twice, 17% moved three times, 8% moved four times in the last five years, and 11% moved five or more times. They decided after five, they weren't gonna, like, six, seven, eight... They're just like, "Five or more in five years, we'll just give you all of that stat." So, 11% of Australians have moved five or more times in the last five years. If every time you move, it's a loss experience, and they're just accumulating those loss experiences, wouldn't you think they'll actually come to see you about? Not the fact that they moved house. They'll come and see you because their relationship is breaking down because they're having arguments at home. Or a whole bunch of other things. So, grief is literally like throwing a back-sack over your back and then, every loss or every grief experience you have, throw another rock into that backpack. And just kinda keep going, "Now, throw another rock! And throw another rock!" Eventually, you do get exhausted. The bag is so damn heavy, you're not going much further. That's the point that clients come to see you guys. They don't get one rock and go, "Hey, how's it going? Uh... I've got this one rock and I was hoping you could get rid of it for me." 

01:11:45
[laughter] 

01:11:50
AMANDA LAMBROS That's not usually what happens. And, uh... yeah, I hear the laughter, which means you know it's true. (laughs) It's very rare that people will collect one rock - one grief or loss - and come directly in to see you and say, "I just have this that I wanna resolve."

01:12:00
AMANDA LAMBROS That would be so wonderful! Your jobs would be so much easier. Maintenance and moving beyond loss? So, to me, maintenance and moving beyond is a huge thing. That was the title of the presentation and that, I think, is massive. If you're able to maintain - I'm not even happy with maintain - I wanna move beyond. So being able to incorporate it into your lifestyle so that it's not limiting how you live your life. Language is huge. The way we use language, you'll notice that in Nancy's video, a lot of the language she uses is similar to the language I use. Language is instrumental in the way that you deal with grief and loss. So just changing from "God, I know how that felt!" "Do you?" (scoffs) "No, I can guarantee you you have no clue how my loss felt!" "Oh, yes, yes! I also lost a child." (scoffs) "I don't care what you lost! It ain't my loss! And your loss is not my loss!" But typically, friends and family - and loving ones - will say that. "Oh god, I totally know how you feel! My husband and I, we got divorced too." "Ah-heh, no! You don't know how I feel, thank you very much!" So, language is a big thing. So rather than "I know how you felt," which I'm sure none of you have ever said. (whispering) No, no, no. No...

01:13:20
AMANDA LAMBROS You change it to "God, I can't imagine how devastating that must be for you." One sentence! I'm not asking you guys to learn a whole dictionary of words here! One sentence will make an lifetime of change when you start dealing with loss. Because you can't imagine how it felt for them. So, how to begin taking, uh, talking to somebody about loss? Is "I can't imagine how this must have felt for you" or "I can't imagine how devastating that must be. Do you wanna talk about it?" What do you not want to say or hear is literally "I know how you felt." "Oh, I totally get it." Hmm... No, you don't. So, I'm going to give you guys something that you can all carry in your back pocket or in your wallet or wherever you wanna carry it. You can start handing it out to clients if you want. But... Sorry, I'm gonna walk slowly over here. These are the Grief Recovery cards. And it literally says the six myths of loss so you have the six myths of loss on one side. And on the back, what to say. And it gives you little starter sentences of what to say. So you guys can all have one of these. And what to never say. So it also has some "If you feel these words coming out of your mouth, just zip it!" Th-they're not really helpful. Um, those are the "I know how you feel," "everything will be okay," anything that reinforces one of the myths, which are here for your reminders. Um... And anything that is about you and not them. So when you're saying, "Oh, yeah! My uncle Jack died." "Oh god, I know! My uncle died last week too!" "No! I'm not telling you so I can hear about your loss. I'm telling you because I wanna tell someone about my loss!" So, you guys can all have one of these. Or a few, if you want. Put 'em in everyone's pockets. Um... We also have a program, Grief Recovery has a program, which I think is absolutely brilliant, called "When Children Grieve." It is actually written... Oh, I did put it up there! It's based on the P.H.D. by Dr. Leslie Landon Matthews. Those of you who are old enough to understand who, um... Oh, I've just lost his name as I said that. Uh... Matthe-, ugh, Langdon. Little House on the Prairie... 

01:15:40
UNKNOWN Michael! 

01:15:40
AMANDA LAMBROS Thank you! Michael Landon! That's his daughter. So, Michael died. His daughter was quite young when she had died. She went on to actually do her P.H.D. in grief and loss. This is her P.H.D. So, it's all talking about how to talk to children. This is not a program run for kids. It's a program run for adults who deal with kids. So, um, a good example I have for you guys is that, um, my child goes to a daycare center. It's a very progressive, awesome daycare center. And they have a dance teacher. And we went away on vacation and while we were on vacation, I get the email that the dance teacher died suddenly. They don't know why, she just died. So, of course, I'm on vacation with my kids and I have to turn around and I have to say, "Hon, just wanted to let you know Auntie Juliet died." Because they all call all the aunties, all the, uh, daycare workers there Auntie whatever. So I said, "Auntie Juliet died." And he goes, "Are you serious?" And I said, "Ye-," and my husband's like, "We're on vacation! Don't talk to him about death!" And I'm like, "Have you lost your mind!?" 

01:16:35

01:16:40
AMANDA LAMBROS I'm Grief Recovery! Like, I'm the person who should talk to my kid about death! So I said, "Don't worry, hon! I've read the book." 

01:16:45
[laughter] 

01:16:45
AMANDA LAMBROS "I know this stuff!" Um... So I said, "No, no, no. It is okay to talk to him about death." And he said, "Oh, I'm really gonna miss her. She did such great dance moves!"

AMANDA LAMBROS And I said, "Oh yeah, that's kinda sad." And I said, "You wanna talk about it right now?" He's like, "Not really, I'd prefer going out into the pool." I said, "Okay, let's go to the pool." So, he didn't want to talk about it at that time. Few days later, he came back. He goes, "You know when you were telling me that Auntie Juliet died?" And I said, "Yeah." He goes, "Can I talk about it now?" I said, "Of course you can, hon!" These are the things... So, then I went into the daycare facility, gave one of these to every single person who worked there, and then I did all the training for everyone who works in that daycare facility, um, as adults in there. So they're all versed with this. They said it's made a light year of difference in the way they work with the kids because they see the relationship breakdowns like divorce and stuff like that. They've had a few parents who have died in the center as well. So they've said that this has actually transformed the way they actually talk with kids and how they can actually say, "Oh, you know..." The gerbil! After I did the training with them, the, uh, gerbil at daycare died. So then they had 20 little kids who were sad that the gerbil that they've all been feeding for the last two years has died. But they said, "You know, it was great 'cuz we actually know how to talk to the kids about it." And I said, "Yeah." So this is actually based on her P.H.D. and it started, it stemmed from the loss she experienced of her dad who died at a very young age. And it's a six-week program so if you do the training, you also have the ability to run that six-week program. So, tips for helping children - I'm gonna put these up there because I think they're amazing and I want you guys to have them. So, listen to your, uh, listen with your heart, not your head. Don't try to intellectualize. Don't try to fact-find. Don't, you know, none of that. Just listen with your heart. No criticism, analysis, or judgment. I'm talking to the converted here - I already know that but good to just reinforce. Recognize that grief is emotional and not intellectual. Adults go first. The reason we say this is that Grief Recovery is done by example. So, I started and I told you that my brother had passed away. He had died in a horrible car accident on day two of my training. All of the training for the certificate works exactly in that principle. The trainer goes first and provides you with the example. And then, you actually do it. It's the exact same way as an adult and a child relationship. I was really sad that Auntie Juliet died because she was awesome. I said that to my son. That then gave him the opportunity to be open enough to talk about Auntie Juliet with me. Remember that every child is unique and each has a unique relationship to the loss, especially if you're dealing with, like, brothers and sisters over a divorce. Don't assume that that blanket conversation is going to blanket. And be patient. I didn't wanna push my child on that first day when he said, "Actually, can I go swimming?" "Yeah, babe! Go ahead!" You know? So that was me being patient. That was me giving him the space he needed to then a few days later come back and say, "Hey, now I'm ready to talk about it." And never say, "Don't feel sad" or "Don't feel scared." Those are two instrumental emotions, human emotions, that we have that we should allow every child and every adult to be able to feel. So, the two most common feelings attached to loss of any kind and they're essential to being human. And somehow, when you start out as a little kid, you're actually allowed to feel these until something occurs. And then we tell 'em not to feel that way anymore. "Don't feel sad," "don't cry," "don't feel scared," "you'll get over it," "it'll be fine in a few days." And so, that's how they get programmed to be adults and your clients who come in with the myths that they have. This is John! This is John James. This was hi-, I'll tell you this was him a few years ago. He doesn't quite look like this anymore. But I'm gonna show you John's video now.

JOHN W. JAMES Creator of The Grief Recovery Method ® Author of The Grief Recovery Handbook 

01:20:50
JOHN W. JAMES My name is John James and I started the Grief Recovery Institute over 30 years ago as a result of the death of a son in 1977. I, like many other people that I've met over the years, had made the assumption that because loss was such a common occurrence, that there would be people who were trained and to know how to help. And sadly, what I discovered is, is that most of the help that people offered was intellectual in nature and my brain wasn't really broken, it was my heart. So over a period of about eight months, I discovered a process that helped me to feel better.

RUSSELL FRIEDMAN Executive Director, The Grief Recovery Institute® Author of The Grief Recovery Handbook 

01:21:35
RUSSELL FRIEDMAN When John James created the phrase "grief recovery" back in the late 70s, almost no one had ever heard the words grief and recovery in the same sentence. And people would say to us, "Is recovery even possible?" To this day, some people still contest it! But we, we discuss it with them. We argue it with them and we show them from our own personal experience, from our own losses, how we have recovered and regained a sense of well-being in our lives in spite of the losses that have happened. 

01:22:00
The Grief Recovery Method® OUTREACH PROGRAM 

01:22:00
JOHN W. JAMES The concept that we were operating with at the time was how do you deliver grief recovery assistance to the largest number of people in the shortest period of time? Consequently, the, the first obvious thing was write a book. The first book was "The Grief Recovery Handbook," which is now in its 4th edition, the 20th anniversary edition, that has been translated into multiple languages. Our book, "When Children Grieve," also has been translated into multiple languages. And our third book, uh, called "Moving On" deals with the enormous sadness that revolves around divorce and romantic relationships that, uh, don't survive, uh, to a, even to, uh, the point of a marriage. But even with a book, you're only gonna reach a certain number of people. And so, we then decided that we would create these Grief Recovery outreach programs, which are a moderated recovery groups where people take very specific actions, uh, to heal their heart. 

01:23:05
"I need to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I feel the Grief Recovery Method Outreach Program has not only changed my life, I feel it has saved it!" N.C. 

01:23:10
RUSSELL FRIEDMAN The really neat part is we give a practical, applicable set of actions people can take rather than sitting and waiting to feel better, which most people do because that's what they were taught. So the key here is actions to feel better or different than we felt and not be paralyzed into inaction, which keeps us stuck forever. 

01:23:35
The Grief Recovery Method® CERTIFICATION TRAINING 

01:23:35
JOHN W. JAMES We began to train people - individuals - who would then return to their local community and moderate these Grief Recovery outreach programs. We started out with, uh, four and... (laughs) And now, I don't know the number. Uh, we have thousands of them now.

The Grief Recovery Method® CERTIFIED GRIEF RECOVERY SPECIALIST® "The most beneficial outcome of The Grief Recovery Method Certification Training is that I can pretty much guarantee my clients a life after grief because of The Grief Recovery Method..." Jeanne Geidel-Neal MFT - Marriage and Family Therapist Newhall, CA 

01:24:00
RUSSELL FRIEDMAN One of the reasons I'm sitting here talking today is so that we can make ourselves available to people when the need is. Otherwise, they go, "I needed you 20 years ago when my daughter died. Where were you?" And we don't want anyone to have to say that ever again. 

01:24:15
JOHN W. JAMES Every loss is as the result of the end of an emotional relationship. And every relationship is unique. So everyone grieves at 100% whatever the loss is. And one loss has nothing whatsoever to do with the other. 

01:24:30
RUSSELL FRIEDMAN Part of Grief Recovery is to unlearn some of the stuff we all learned. So it, and whether we learned it professionally or at the feet of our parents doesn't matter. We have to unlearn some myths about grief so we can learn the method that will help us complete unfinished business.

DEBI JENKINS FRANKLE, LMFT Grief Recovery Method® Certification Instructor 

01:24:45
DEBI JENKINS FRANKLE It is up to the griever, uh, when they decide that they are willing and able to come in to do the Grief Recovery Method. Um... It is not up to us to tell them when they have to do that. One of the most heartbreaking things is that we hear from grievers is they call and say, "Well, I was told that I'm not supposed to come into a group or do any work for a year." Which, uh, which is, uh, which is kind of crazy. 

01:25:15
JOHN W. JAMES It is never too soon to start to heal your heart. I would say that within 15 minutes following a loss of any kind, the griever's mind is already starting to identify the things that they wish they had done differently or better. I cannot imagine nor have I seen in 34 years any benefit accrued to anyone as a result of waiting. 

01:25:40
RUSSELL FRIEDMAN We have a different perspective and the perspective is two things. It's an absolute respect of unique individual human relationships and a recognition of a method of recovery that is available to anyone who's willing to do it. 

01:26:00
JOHN W. JAMES I don't care where they live. I don't care what their economic status. I don't care what their religious beliefs are. When you experience a loss, your heart hurts. And we would love to help all the people who a-are having that kind of an experience.

AMANDA LAMBROS So, it's not a support group, I do wanna tell you that. It is not at all a support group. Um... It's an action group. It really does force the people who choose to take it on board, to take action about the loss that they're experiencing. So it addr-, it obviously addresses incomplete communication and it really does create long-term benefits because you start living in a more mindful space with the current relationships that you have. So the certification training is available in Australia now. (whispering) Yay! Um... (laughs) I'm kinda very over the moon about that because it, it's a long time coming before it actually landed here. It was about three years in the process to get it over to Australia and it's now here. Um... The first training just, uh, occurred in Perth, which was excellent. Um... So I can say we now have 12 people across Australia - oh wait, they're mostly in Perth, um, (laughs) that have done the training. We have two from Melbourne and a few in Sydney who had previously done the training out of L.A. who are available to do the training. And depending on which organization you belong to, you can get professional development for it as well. Um... A big thing that I do want to stress is that you a-, are not required to be a trained mental health professional to undergo this training because it's not counseling. It's an action group and everything you're provided with is, like, step by step. Like, read this. That's what they do. Here's the handout. Give it to them. Read this. Hand them that. Like it's... It is not counseling and it is not a support group. It's an action group and it's literally, like, connecting dots... is the best way to be able to describe it. Um... But once you have it down, it is like the coolest, easiest thing to do. And I just - very biased - but I love having it in my life. Um... Obviously, absolute confidentiality because we do work in very small groups. So we had a group of 12. All the groups are usually in gr-, smaller group of three so that they can have the opportunity to share their loss, graphs, and all the little tools that we actually do. So confidentiality is a massive thing. Um... once you're certified, there's a seven or a 12-week outreach group that you're able to do, which is the group work. You're also able to use it as a one-on-one tool within your own practice. Um... Obviously, as mental health practitioners, if you already have a men-, uh, if you already have a practice, there are some organizations that have actually taken it on, which is "Assisting Kids" and, um, "Cancer W.A." have taken it on to train all their staff to be able to actually, um, offer this to their staff members. So... And there's no additional, like, cost or fees or anything like that. Um... So, to me, it's the most productive workshop and training that I've ever been involved with and on. And I've done a lot of training! Um... So I love it. I've incorporated it into my life. I am here for the whole conference and I am happy to talk to any of you about it. Um... I have heaps of stuff up here if you want to read about the outreach groups or the training or question me... Definitely come and get the little cards of what to and what not to say, um, so that you have those available to you. And any questions? Thank you so much for being here! Let me just say... Super duper duper thank you.
