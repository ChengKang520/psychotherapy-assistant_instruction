JAY HALEY (1923-2007) was known as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, strategic therapy, and brief therapy. His early work was in collaboration with some of the foremost thinkers of our time such as, Gregory Bateson and Milton H. Erickson, MD. He was a professor at Stanford University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, and at the California School of Professional Psychology. He published more than 20 books and over a hundred papers.

An Absurd Case of Milton H. Erickson, MD 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY It's usually, uh, in substance abuse, or physical abuse, or sex abuse, it's a situation to where either it's court ordered, which sometimes happens, or it's court encouraged in which the court implies it would be a good idea if the person had therapy. Or it's, uh, people go into therapy hoping when a case comes up they'll win leniency from the court. So, there's a variety of ambiguous situations, and sometimes you get a, somebody like a PCP gentleman I had, uh, who, when asked if he wanted to change, said no. He, uh, would be clean while his urine was being tested but as soon as that was done, he would go back to PCP. He'd always smoked it, always enjoyed it. Why should he stop? Some of them are honest, and then you struggle to find some way to motivate them. Others pretend, so you never know for sure whether they're going along with the therapy, they're not going along with the therapy. We just spent 12 sessions with a crack addict, working with him and his wife, and he did all the right things, he said all the right things, he behaved absolutely properly, he followed every task, and I don't know whether the guy has changed or not or whether he's just getting through the therapy until he's clear of the court, and then he'll go about his business like he always did, which was smoking a lot of crack. So, it's, uh, it's a situation where we're always a little ambiguous, uh, in the situation, and often you're disappointed. We had, uh, a family brought in by the court, and a young woman therapist worked with the family, and they had a lot of enthusiasm. She had a lot of enthusiasm. They reorganized the family and all, and she was very pleased with the therapy. They got into court and the next day when they were supposed to come to therapy, they never did. Never called back, never came. Once court was over, they were over. So, uh, you never know when you can trust people in terms of their behavior in the therapy room, that's it. It's a peculiar therapy. We've all had some experience with it I think. We've had situations where's a kid is sent by the school to therapy. If you ask a family why they're here, they say the school made us, and the school can't really make them come to therapy, but the school can make it very hard on the kid if they don't, so, uh, often, uh, it's responded to by the family like they've been dragged in, really. We've also had adolescents dragged in by their parents where their, as far as the adolescent's concerned it's a compulsory therapy. They do this to avoid something worse. You get it with spouses who come in, not because they want to, but because the other spouse says either we go to therapy or we split, and they don't want to split, so. Now this, this has been in the air around therapy, always, but most therapy, most schools of therapy are constructed on a patient who wants to be there and seeks the person out. In these cases, that isn't so, and it's a curious situation. It's one in which, uh, there's not enough, there's not much autonomy in the therapy in the sense that ordinarily in therapy you can decide how you'll do it depending on your social setting, because certainly in private practice you can decide whether you'll see the individual, or the family, or the couple, or just how you'll go about it. But in this kind of therapy, there's a lot of colleagues who are, uh, helping you with the case, and you may not be able to work the way you think you've got to work because the colleagues, uh, often have more power than you do, and they say it should be done this way. Uh, for example, we wanted to bring a mother and daughter together, and Protective Services said they wouldn't allow them in the same room because of what the mother had done with the daughter. So, we, uh, I had to captain the way we wanted the therapy because somebody with more power had stepped in, and that's unusual, I think. Although, we've all had that to some extent with medication cases, where if you're not a physician, somebody else is medicating your person, uh, in ways you'd rather they didn't and they go on doing it, and you can't get 'em into the case or out of the case. We've, that is, we've, we've struggled with hospitalization and medication issues, which have their involuntary nature and which, uh, limit therapies and therapists and what they can do, I think. There's another issue about abuse cases is they're often awful cases. I mean, not only are people ruining their lives with drugs and addling their brains and such, but there's kids being abused and being sexually abused, and, uh, and, and everybody has a limit. In traditional therapy, you could listen and say, "Tell me more about that," and be objective, but, but some of the cases that you get on these you really just can't be, you know? You really are horrified, uh, by what happens, and everybody has a limit in the sense that, uh, some can put up with all kinds of things but not others, and, uh, everybody involved gets upset with some cases, like this mother and daughter. What happened is the 13-year old daughter was sexually abused by her father, and he was taken out of the home. The social workers felt mother and daughter should be closer, so they encouraged them to be closer. About a year later, mother and daughter started an explicit sexual relationship and this went on for a while and then the mother began to feel terrible about it so she turned herself in, and everybody got upset about this mother doing this with this daughter. Uh, Protective Service wouldn't allow the mother in the same room. We wanted to bring them together. We started seeing the mother, and we wanted to bring them together to work out, uh, where was the daughter going to live, and what had happened, and what would happen in the future, and so on, but they weren't allowed in the same room. It took us, uh, the daughter was put in a shelter. She was taken out immediately, even, and there were three or four smaller children in the family which she was a parental child of, and they just lost their whole existence that quick. In the shelter, she kept running away to come home and the mother wouldn't let her come home because the court had said you're not allowed at home. So she would call her mother, and her mother would say, "I'm not allowed to talk to you." You know, 'cuz the mother was really trying to do her best in the situation, and the, uh, Protective Service people insisted they wouldn't allow her in the room with the daughter and we said, "The daughter's on the phone with her, and the daughter's running away. She's not being protected very well," and they would say, "By George, she's not going near that woman." So it took us about three months and they got, we got an agreement that we provided an individual therapist for the daughter then we could bring mother and daughter together. So we did, and the therapist had a few sessions with the daughter. Then we brought mother and daughter together finally, and they talked about what happened, and they talked about the future, and the daughter said she wasn't sure where she wanted to live in the future, and, uh, at that point the court case came up and the mother was sentenced to a year in jail, which interfered with the therapy somewhat. But fortunately, she was put in a, in a jail that we have a pre-release center it's called, where they let her out on weekends. They, uh, help her get a job to pay for her keep, uh, and they, it did her a lot of good. She lost weight, got a job, uh, began to make some friends outside her situation, and, uh, while she was in jail we had to bring the grandmother from Chicago to take care of the other kids because the father couldn't take care of them because he was banned from the kids, so, for his previous behavior, and, uh, finally, oh, then they, they got the daughter in a foster home, and when the mother in the foster home heard what this girl did, and this mother did, she said, "You had to, well you have an absolutely terrible mother," and she spent every day attacking the girl's mother to the girl. We tried to get the foster mother into the therapy room because we tried to get all the adults involved in the case, and, uh, she said by God she wouldn't be in the same room with a woman like that. That is everybody gets so upset about this, uh, and the young lady stayed in the foster home with that woman, uh, and we went on with the mother and she did pretty well, and the other kids did okay. But, uh, nobody can treat this in a rational, objective matter is what I'm saying. These cases touch everybody in special ways so that you have to, uh, you have to anticipate that you're going to be personally touched if you handle much abuse cases. We had one, uh, you know, we had kind of a funny one. Funny. There was a guy arrested for exhibiting himself. He liked to drive along in a car, along, and would pull alongside women up in vans and trucks who would look down, and then he would expose himself, and a woman turned him in. And he came to therapy, and he was a graduate student of psychology, and, uh, he had a young woman therapist. And he said to her, uh, "You know, I know the business so, uh, I could let you pull out of me step-by-step my whole sexual history, but why don't I just lay it out and save us both time," and she said okay. So, he said, "Well, this isn't the first time I've exhibited myself. I've been doing this a long time, it's just the first time I ever got arrested." She said, "I see. Tell me more." He said, "I spent quite a bit of time, too, making obscene phone calls. For a while, I got quite a kick out of that," and she said, "I see. Tell me more." And he said, "I worked as a policeman for a while, and I essentially raped some of the prisoners I arrested," and she said, "Oh." And I could begin to see her cooling off a bit, or warming up as the case might be. I was behind the mirror supervising this, and then he said, "I worked as a therapist for a while, and I seduced several of my women patients," and this blew it for the young woman. She began to turn red. I called her out of the room and walked her up and down the hall for a while, but that touched her more than anything else, and she cooled down and she went back but she never could deal with that guy, uh, very rationally or objectively. That is, everybody has some personal thing that gets touched when you work with a variety of abuse cases, and it makes them a problem to deal with, uh, particularly if you have to deal with them because of the place where you work. You can't just throw them out. But, at any rate, ordinarily, you can make a plan in therapy for what you'll do, like, you can decide, uh, that this is a person that one intervention is going to make a big change. Or, you can think this is a person that is going to take accumulative change over time. They'll change a little bit at a time, and, uh, you'll have a choice on that. If you're dealing with a serious abuse case, you don't have a choice. You've got to act at some point. You can't have a kid beaten a little less over the months. You've got to stop the beating, stop the sexual behavior, or whatever it might be; and therefore, you're not free to, to choose different ways of working. It's, uh, it's a special problem because, uh, I think that's what's driving a lot of people toward brief therapy seminars and workshops now because they're looking for interventions that work rapidly because they're dealing with problems that are volatile, and uh, that if you don't work rapidly, you're in a problem. But, it takes away some of your choice is what I'm getting at. One of the, uh, things that family therapists are into is they like systems theory, and systems theory assumes that whatever a person does, it's because of what someone else did. That it's a sequence that happens among people. You can't have systems theory in the legal system, in the court system. The court has to be linear. The court has to say, "This is a villain, and this is a victim, and we're going to do something to this villain." If you say this guy was a villain because of what his wife did, the court doesn't like that at all. They won't put husband and wife on trial. They'll put the guy on trial, so there's a lot of struggling of family therapists to, to think in a systems way while working in a system that has to be linear by its very nature, and it's a problem of collaboration. The result is often that, uh, the Protective Service people think family therapists are too soft, and family therapists think Protective Service people are too hard, and you get a kid caught between them just like they're caught between two parents when one says the other's too hard, the other says the other's too soft. And it's in the nature of clinicians trying to explain, uh, behavior in such a way that the court sees that as excusing the person, and, uh, it can't allow that. There's no excuse. You go to jail. That's all. So, it's, uh, it's a problem, how to think your own theory, really, and work with these cases. Your own explanation of why the case is the way it is may not be the way the court is going to insist the way it is. But there's another, even more interesting thing to me. That is, you see often court people and therapists in trouble with each other, arguing or whatever, and often they take it out as a, a personality thing. Many therapists say that court people are the least trained, they're the lowest paid out of anybody in the field, and, therefore, they're not, uh, adequate for their task and so on. But often it's just a matter of position that you're in; that is, if you're a therapist, you have to assume that change is possible. I mean, change is your business so if you're not able to change, get out of the business. But, when anybody comes in, you assume you're going to find a way to change them, and that's inevitable in the nature of this. You assume they're going to be able to manage, uh, a path to get past this and live a normal life. For Protective Services, the responsible position is to assume nobody changes, that this kid has to be protected forever and monitored by the community because that family will never change and that kid will be abused again. That's their safest position in the sense that if the kid does get abused, they get the blame for not handling it well. So, they have a heavy responsibility of, of hurt kids. But a therapist has got to assume they're going to change their family so the kid won't get hurt and they want their family to handle their problem and not monitors from the community forever. So, it's, uh, difficult. Naturally different theories of the field, and the, the primary abuse therapy is groups, and, uh, that makes a problem for family therapists. That is, if you have a husband beating up on his wife, many people would consider you in error and a cad if you don't put the husband in a group and the wife in a group, the husband in the villain group, the wife in the victim group. They don't even like to have them brought together in the same room, and they'll, I give that, even if the couple is living together. We take a different position that, uh, we'll, we'll work it out with the family and we'll bring the family members together, and I don't know of enough evidence of outcome on either side. I think, particularly with violent couples, it's best to see them together. But, if you describe working that way, I've had a gentleman stand up at a workshop and say that's absolutely wrong. You shouldn't allow them in the same room. The husband should be in a villains group for five years before you see them together. So it's a different, different ideology. One of the errors of the court, I think, and one way it could be improved, is they do no outcome studies. They refer to a therapist, and they have the opportunity to go after them because they have control of the data pretty well over the years, and I don't know of any of them that have. Judges have just gotten sold on therapy and they just pass people out to therapists all around without ever saying, "Are they doing these people any good, or any harm?" So, if they would do that, then we would know the best way to do it. One of the interesting things that's different to me than Protective, in therapy than Protective Service, is the therapist has the responsibility for the villain, as well as the victim. Protective Service largely has a responsibility to the victim, but if you have a father who is incestuously involved with a daughter, to just do something about the daughter and leave him out would be inappropriate for a therapist, I think. You've got to do something about him. It's not only that you have an obligation, because he's got a problem or he wouldn't have done this, but if he's just taken out of the family that may not solve it at all. He'll find somebody else, uh, sometimes he'll move to another state and marry again and find another child. So, it isn't just out of kindness you help the father, it's also to prevent this kind of thing going on as part of the therapeutic obligation. So, it's a special problem. But at any rate, the, the Protective Service people really don't believe people are going to change, and it's, it's difficult for them when, when they have that responsibility, but you know, there's another issue that comes up. Everybody is right from their position, and it makes it difficult. One of the things now that happens is if you get an abuse case, the vil-, the villain gets an attorney. Often the victim gets an attorney. Sometimes the whole family gets an attorney. Attorneys do very well in abuse cases. They multiple around these cases. But we had a case of a young man who sexually abused his sister for a period of time, and, uh, he was remanded to the court and the court gave him an, uh, an attorney, a young woman who said to him, "Don't admit anything. Don't say anything about what happened." And so he came into the therapy with the family and he wouldn't say anything, and his sister who wanted to protect him wouldn't say anything. So we had a therapy where we couldn't even talk about what happened. But the defense attorney was absolutely correct from her point of view, you know? Her client was that young man and she should protect him by having him not admit anything, but it makes it impossible to collaborate in therapy with that kind of, uh, thing. So the people who, from their position, are correct compound the problem from somebody else's position, and that's common in this business. One of the, um, things they need is some kind of a community forum. Uh, if if Protective Service workers and therapists could meet once a month and talk about a case and talk about what might be done, or what the premises are about handling it, because they do collaborate. We have a lot of involvement with Protective Services. We get a lot of referrals from 'em now. So you can work with them after a while. Once they realize that you're going to take a responsible position and not be carefree about the poor, suffering victim and so on, they'll work with you and, uh, you can collaborate but it's not easy. It takes time. That case of that mother who, uh, sexually abused her daughter, we must have spent 90% of the time with, with colleagues on the phone and talking and meeting and very little time with the family. The families are relatively easy compared with the problem of dealing with colleagues who are all involved and upset over these cases. So, at any rate, even if you, uh, just take on these cases, there's a different problem for therapists, particularly for therapists who did a "tell me more about that" therapy. They can't just have that kind of therapy with, with an abuse problem that might go on at any moment or that is going on. They have to take decisions and do something, and many therapists don't like to have to make the decisions that have to be made. Like, should you take somebody out of the house, like a father out of the house where there's an in-, incestuous act with a daughter. A therapist would rather have somebody else decide that often, and, and work with the consequences of the decision rather than having to make the decision. I mean, that's a tough decision. If you take a father out of the house, you often make it much harder on the victim because the one who gets blamed is the daughter, when the father's taken out and the family loses his income. So, uh, a righteous 'let's just get this guy away from his daughter' can compound the daughter's problem because the whole family can pick on her. You also get into political decisions, uh, I guess they're like political decisions, if you're deciding whether to put a villain back in the home or not. Say a brother who's abused his sister and now therapy's finished and he's been out of the home and should he come back and live in the home, or should he not, and, uh, you have a responsibility there that, uh, there is consequences to whatever decision you make. One of the cases we had was a, a brother who sexually abused his sister for five years or so, about 9 to 14. Well, she told a friend. The school got into it, and he got arrested and taken right out of the home. He was 18 then. He wanted to, he was forbidden to visit the house or ever see his sister by the court. He wanted to, uh, visit the house and have dinner with the family or watch a movie with them every once in awhile, and that was part of the issue when we brought the family together to work on this problem and resolve it. One of the things, the girl kept running away, and one of the things it looked like is, and not an uncommon problem that the villain in the case, the boy, was the favorite son of the parents, and he couldn't be in their house with the daughter there. But if the daughter got kicked out of the house, then the son could be in the house, and it looked for a while as we working with this family like that was happening, that they were provoking the daughter to run away so she could be put somewhere so that the brother could come home. That is, ordinarily you don't have to think of things like that in therapy, uh, but when you have the authority to put somebody in and out of the home, you're into a situation where people manipulate you and you have a lot of problems. It didn't prove to be true in this case, actually, but, uh, it looked like it for a while. At any rate, uh, there's a, uh, a question whether you should take the villain out of the home, but often what happens is the kid is taken out of the home to protect the kid. And, if you're the therapist who has to make that decision, that is a tough decision because you start the kid in a foster home career usually. You go, he goes to a shelter somewhere, then he goes into a foster home. There's a question whether it's gonna be worse for him in a foster home career than if he's with his family there, where he's being mistreated, uh, at times. So, you, you have to make that decision and that judgment call when you have no influence over the nature of the foster homes these kids go into, so it's a problem. In New York, uh, Manuchen (ph) has been dealing with foster homes in New York, and he was telling, I just forgot the figure, he was telling me how, the fantastic number of kids out in foster homes these days. It's almost like going back to the 18th century when kids were put with other families to apprentice and jobs and such. They often weren't raised by their own families, and that's happening now, but it's a tough decision when you have to make it. It's better if somebody else makes it, and then you can reflect on it. There's also the question, uh, just simple things like who should attend the therapy interviews? If there's been a brother/sister sex abuse, should the siblings be brought in, particularly if the idea is they don't know about it? And, uh, would they know about it, particularly if it was going on for a period of time? Often, uh, they know about it and feel guilty because they never blew the whistle on it, so they have a problem that doesn't come out unless you bring them into the therapy. But there's just, there's decisions that you have to make where, uh, as an example, I don't think anybody is sure whether there should be a confrontation in, uh, if a, if a woman was sexually abused a long time ago in childhood by her father, should there be a confrontation between her and her father? And that's a very complicated decision when you have to make that decision on whether it would be harder for her, depending on the outcome of the confrontation, or whether it's good for her to go through the confrontation. It's an, nobody knows really and I think we decide now on individual cases, but there's not any, uh, routine outcome results that tell you, "Yes, this is the way you should do it every time." Well, I'll tell you about a confrontation. One of the, uh, many years ago, this problem's been around quite a while. In Denver, Frank Pittman, and Cal Flomanov (ph), and Carolyn Young (ph) were a treatment team whose job was to keep people out of the hospital, and when the staff thought somebody should be hospital, hospitalized, this team met a random number of them and kept them out, and hey were very successful. They kept out 80 to 90% . They weren't trying to cure 'em, they were just trying to help them find another solution besides hospitalization for whatever was driving them crazy, and I went to observe them one time as a kind of consultant with them, and, uh, a young woman, 18-years old came in with her parents and said that her father had incest with her. The mother said that's not, and, and she was all upset about this, and was gonna be put in the hospital. So, the team brought them together, and the mother said it wasn't true that the father did that and the daughter began to scream by God it was true, the father did that. The mother said it wasn't true. The father said, "I don't really know. I was drunk at the time," and they had a scene that is so loud I could play the audio tapes and I could hurt your ears with the screaming, I mean, that was a confrontation. And, it had happened, the sex had happened, uh, two or three years before. It wasn't current at all. But, anyhow, the team saw the young woman alone and she says, "Every time I bring this up I get put in the hospital." So the team, looking for a way to avoid hospitalization, said, "Wouldn't it be better if you didn't bring this up?" She said, "I want that man to admit that he did this." So they went around and around for about three interviews on this, and finally the girl decided not to, to, not to go through with it 'cuz she was going in the hospital, there was no question. That's how it was done in those days. The victim was put in the hospital, and, uh, I remember thinking that confrontation didn't seem to be very helpful, but nobody knows. There are people now who argue it should be done. You should have a confrontation like that. And it often takes that form, that the mother denies it, and the father says he doesn't know, and that makes the young woman even more frustrated that he can't even remember whether it happened or not. There's also the a question whether, as a therapist, you should encourage forgiveness for, uh, for sex abuse or for physical violence or whatever the abuse might be? Should you encourage people to forgive or is this an unforgivable sin that should not be forgiven? You're into those decisions because your clients are struggling with these decisions. Should I forgive, or shouldn't I forgive? But what I'm emphasizing is that, uh, these are issues that come up in this kind of therapy that therapists in the past really haven't had to deal with. Uh, they could maintain a neutral, objective stance and stay out of decisions like this often in the past but things have, things have changed. One of the ways to think about it is I think it sounds like sex abuse and physical abuse and substance abuse are really very different, but they have in common certain things, and I think they have in common some stages of therapy and I think there's some steps that get involved. For one thing they have in common, they're all secret activities and they're all illegal activities. So, you're going to be involved often with the legal system. You're also going to be involved with secrets and the way we found it best is to start, the first step is to deal with your colleagues in terms of who's in charge of the case and what are the limitations on your therapy and what restrictions, and will somebody take somebody out of the family without your permission and so on. That is, you have to find out who's in charge, and often it's helpful to bring a court person into the session, the first session and have them lay out the legal situation so that, uh, everybody knows what it is. Otherwise, there's confusion and all but, on just what is a violation of probation and so on. So, you start with your colleagues and then you get the facts in your first interview. I think you should make an issue of learning the secrets in the first interview, what kind of dope is being taken, and when, and how much, and so on. What kind of physical abuse? What's the worst abuse that's happened? What kind of sex abuse exactly, explicitly describing what happened and how it was done. Was the penis inserted and so on. I think if you do that the first interview, you have a better chance at getting the facts than later because they, they expect it for one thing. But also, uh, later you get to know them and they get to know you, and they begin to be embarrassed to admit what they did, and it's a harder task really to just find out what happened and I think you need to know what happened because you've got to keep it from happening again. You need to know the range of just what the problem is. I think, uh, that then you need to get an agreement that people will want to change. Do you want to change or don't you? And sometimes you get it that they just don't, that they're just putting up with this. And sometimes they say they want to change when really they don't. They're just pacifying you so you'll make a proper report to the court, but I think it helps if you, uh, if you can motivate them to change. If you can get on their side and say there's something in this for you, that getting over this, taking this dope, is really a valuable thing, for example. I think you then, uh, have to take some kind of action. After you've got some agreement they want to change, you need to do something. You can't just talk about the problem really. You've got to make an intervention, which may be to have somebody to monitor the behavior so it doesn't happen again or it may be some kind of a task, or it may be the steps to avoid companions that lead you to drink or whatever it might be, but some action I think needs to be requested. It's helpful to organize the family to do it rather than the community because there's just not enough community people for all the abuse in this country apparently. It's gonna, half the country is going to be watching the other half of the country, uh, the way that things are going. I think probably it's protection law to have to report abuse that has brought out the tremendous amount of abuse in this country. Unless it's a new fashion, or new trend, that's an awful trend. Nobody knows whether we're just discovering what's been going on all the time or whether this is a whole new thing. If you talk to Europeans they say, "Pretty strange over in your country. We don't have any of that sort of thing," but they also don't have any reporting law, so nobody knows what sort of thing they have over there. I think the Reporting Law is a very good law. It saves a lot of victims. It's a pain to a therapist, but it, uh, it does help victims. Sometimes you have such a complicated way of having to deal with it, I'll give you an example. A therapist called Dave Eddy, Executive Director, and said, "I have a woman who has a problem. She has a 14-year old boy at home, and she was just told by two older boys who are out of the home that they were sexually molested by the father, and, uh, I've forgotten how it got phrased, but, uh, she wants to know could she come to therapy and not have this reported? So, Dr. Eddy said, "Certainly she could not because you have to report it if you know who the person is," and the other therapist said, "Well, if you didn't know who the woman was, then you wouldn't have to report it." He said, "I couldn't report a name, I don't even know the name." So this woman showed up anonymously and him them story, and, uh, it was, it was so complicated just to see the woman with this problem in terms of these reporting laws, and what he ended up was seeing the father and persuaded the father into turning himself in and the father did. So the reporting aspect of it got solved, but if the, if the woman had just reported the father and turned him in, there would have been such a disrupt-, she already was divorcing him. She separated from him, but it would have made such a disruption in that whole situation that, uh, it would've been a problem is what he thought. But, I didn't tell that exactly the way it happened. It was a very complicated involvement with nobody's name mentioned in order to avoid this law, which is a good law, you know? And, you'll find with this law, that, uh, it varies in the country very much and it varies in your own place. We've had cases go, we'd report something and nothing was done about it at all, and at other times we've reported it in the morning and they said, "You knew about this at 5:00 yesterday, how come you didn't report it then, because it could have happened again overnight or whatever." So, you, you get such a variety in the way people respond to this law that it's a problem. Well, at any rate, where was I? You deal with your colleagues. You get the secrets out. You ask for a change. You take some kind of action. And then I think you always need to anticipate a relapse, and organize people to deal with what if this relapse occurs? >What's going to happen? And, uh, you have to plan what to do if it's going to happen. Then if you get a, if you're successful, and the abuse isn't happening anymore, then I think you have to adjust everybody to that change, 'cause that's quite a change. Where you probably see this most is, uh, alcoholics, serious alcoholics. When they stop drinking, they have a problem with their families. If you have a father, for example, who's been out of it and drunk for a long time, the family is organized to do without him. The older son has replaced him with the kids, and the wife is, just as soon not be involved with him. He stops drinking and he then wants to begin to assert himself as husband and father, and there's a, quite a reaction in the family very often. They essentially expel him unless he has some help and they have some help integrating him back in, hierarchically correct as a father and as a husband. Often what happens is everybody get into a thing with him about it, and he withdraws, returns to drink again, and everybody says, "Well it's a disease that he keeps relapsing," but the social situation makes it difficult particularly when family's organize in such a way that a person is peripheral and then wants to be more central, an adult. It's easier with a kid I think often than with an adult who has responsibilities. So at any rate, I think you have to expect that there's going to be some instability when you get a change in an abuse case. Everybody has to get organized around, uh, not having them as a part of their life anymore, and sometimes that's a big change. Well, I thought what I'd do, uh, is show a way of handling a heroin case from a family point of view. It's a, it's a case where, uh, the approach was essentially worked out with young psychotics and, uh, applied to heroin addicts. It's a, uh, it's a family approach that has certain premises. Well, let me do it by, uh, talking about how we would think about it. A woman calls and said her 23-year old daughter is a heroin addict and has just been kicked out of a two year residency program. She was kicked out because she shot up when she shouldn't have, and, uh, could they come in for therapy. The therapist asks who lives in the home. She said, "My husband and I and our daughter live at home. We have two sons, one living nearby and the other one in another state." The therapist says, "I'd like to see all of you, and we'd like that because we like to have all the help we can get a problem like this." It isn't just on some theory that you ought to bring in their family, it's 'cause you're going to need everybody with a difficult case. The mother says, uh, "My son out of state, he won't come in. He's too busy. My son who lives nearby won't speak to his sister, and my husband at the moment isn't speaking to his daughter because she shot up after promising not to so he won't come in." So the therapist said what a therapist should say I think, "Do you mind if I talk to your husband?" It was a young woman therapist. So the mother said something like, "good luck", so the therapist talked to the father and said, "Would you come in?" and he said no, and she talked a while with him and said, "Would you come in for my sake, and just for one session?" And he said okay. He didn't want his coming in to mean that he'd forgiven his daughter for shooting up, but if he could come in for some other reason then he would come in. So, uh, we would have certain assumptions when we start with this. We would assume that the daughter is shooting up in relation to the family. Now, she might be shooting up in relation to all kinds of other things, this is the one, the hypothesis we choose. We assume that, uh, it's a way of stabilizing the family, and we assume that if she becomes more normal, the parents will threaten separation. Once she stops shooting up, the parents are going to talk about separation. It doesn't mean they'll separate, but it'll, it'll be an issue. At that point, the odds are that she'll shoot up and then they'll pull back together and they'll take care of her until she begins to be normal, and then they'll threaten separation and go unstable. And I don't think, I think this has been misunderstood, I think it, this doesn't mean that the parents want her to be a heroin addict, or need her to be one, or need her to be crazy, or whatever. It means that's their adjustment to improvement. That's what's going to happen when she improves. I think if she was in a hospital and improved rapidly the staff would go unstable. I think you'll notice this in your own therapy that if you have a patient who, uh, says to you one day, "You know, I don't think I need you anymore. I'm doing very well." You're going to say, "Oh, uh, in all areas of your life? That is, you're going to start looking for something wrong, and you're going to get unsettl-, you're going to get upset about it, and tell ya what you're... And this is, even though that's the very thing you want is your client to get over this problem, and I think, uh, there's a reaction to change of this nature. But since that's going to happen, we assume that we should join the parents so they will turn to us when they go unstable, turn to the therapist and not the daughter. To do that, you have to persuade the parents you're on their side. You have to really join the parents against the daughter, essentially, and, uh, we begin that way on the side of the parents. The daughter is wrong, and if there's any kind of contention between father and daughter, the father's right and the daughter's wrong. That's the position we go in prepared to do. It saves making decisions as a rule because you know you're always going to side with the parents. Once the daughter's back to normal, or behaving more reasonably, then she has the rights of anybody, but when she's shooting up, she's wrong. So the therapist prepares in her thinking to go in there to side with the parents, and that's hard for some therapists. Many people want to be fair, and this is not fair. The, uh, other assumption will be that we have to get the daughter away from drug rehabilitation. Away from that environment, that life. We'd like her into a different life without drug addicts around her. Back to college, or working, or with a different group of friends, something like that. So we would push for, uh, her going into a different way of life than she has lived up til now. She's been this way. And we assume, too, that, uh, we're going to hav-, give the parents the task of stopping her from taking heroin. We're going to assume that the parents are not going to welcome this opportunity because they don't believe they can stop her. But, the argument is that if she takes it in relation to them and they insist she stop it, then she knows they're okay without her is the logic of this. It's, uh, like the logic of different cases I've been presenting you. And, therefore, it's important that they stop. If somebody else stops her, that doesn't resolve anything. They could still need that. So, uh, those are some of the assumptions before they walk in the door, and if we're right, we're way ahead of the game in terms of where we are after the first interview. If we're wrong and it isn't that kind of a situation at all, I mean, you can have a situation where that isn't the way it is, then you've got a problem when you get in the room and you have to be like a zen master and reverse yourself completely and start on a whole new track. But, if you're right, you're way ahead. So anyhow, what I'll show is some excerpts from the first interview with this family. And, it was one of those cases, it was very lucky. Everything happened like it ought to happen, and it makes a nice case to talk about. It doesn't mean they all happen this easy is what I'm saying. This was a difficult young woman. She was asked her drug history. We want to know everything she took, partly so we can stop whatever she's taking but also to get an idea of, sometimes it helps to have them, uh, talk about their drug history to teach the parents about drugs. Sometimes the parents don't know different drugs. In this case, the parents did. They're in education. They deal with kids on drugs everyday so they know those things. She, uh, she lays out her, her drug his-, there''s another reason for laying out a drug history. Addicts, a young woman, there's a hierarchical problem in this family. This young woman runs the family. All she has to do is shoot up and the parents collapse over anything. They are so desperate not to have her harm herself, and, uh, one of the problems was that when she got kicked out of the residency program, the parents were angry because they'd been to Parent's Night, and they'd done all that. And that had a quarrel with her when she came home that night, and the next morning she got on a bus to go to work and disappeared. She didn't take a coat. She didn't take a bag. She just left, and they started hunting for her and they found her downtown on the streets three months later and persuaded her to come back home. But they hesitate to discipline her in any way because she just disappears, and that's a problem hierarchically so that their life begins to get devoted around the issue of hoping she won't shoot up, or trying to stop it or whatever, and all she has to do is threaten to and they give in on anything, really. But, at the same time, even though an addict has that kind of power in the home, they feel like the bottom of a barrel, really. They feel like they're the lowest of the low, and it helps to have something that they're an expert in, and usually what they're an expert in is drugs. So, then if you have them lecture their parents about the different kinds, and the different effects, it raises their stakes in an interesting way. Oh, what happened, they continued, this was in the spring. They continued for a couple or three months with us and she continued to improve. The parents had their difficulties which we struggled with, but... and then, but it was a lucky case in the sense that everything happened the way it ought to. As an example, they were going to spend the summer, the parents, they had a place at the beach, and the daughter was going to go over there and work as a waitress or something to be at the beach for the summer. And the father, who was retiring, would stay there with her, and the mother would come weekends and we didn't like that arrangement because we would rather have mother and father together and the daughter going off somewhere, ya know, because we were struggling to move her out of that. And I remember the therapist and I sat down and talked about half an hour about how could we block this from happening? And the family came in, and the daughter said, "You know, I don't think I'll go to the beach this summer. I'm behind in my studies, and I have to catch up, and I can go to summer classes." She said, "I'd rather stay here." So then the father said, "Well, if you won't go to the beach, I won't go to the beach." So the mother says, "Why wouldn't you go to the beach if she wouldn't go to the beach?" He said, "Well, I have to be here to keep an eye on her." That is, it got into that issue, uh, that is a hot issue with this mother, daughter, and father. But at any rate, they didn't go to the beach, and she continued to do well, and in the summer, uh, the therapist got offered a very good job in Kansas City. So then we had to decide whether to terminate, or to transfer, or whatever. You know, we talked it over with the family and decided to terminate. One of the interesting ways it was handled, I thought, the, uh, you worry about, uh, this daughter became very fond of this therapist and you worry about if I go off will the daughter be abandoned as a patient and so on? But what happened is the therapist met with her and began to talk to her about her career, and they, the daughter's career, and they discussed what she was planning to do. The therapist then talked about her career, and then the therapist said, "I've been offered a very good job that's going to advance my career, and I'm in the middle of the decision whether to take it or not." And they talked it over, about the therapist leaving, not leaving a poor patient, but leaving a career girl to go enhance her own career. That is, it changed into a different kind of discussion, really. It was interesting. Anyhow, uh, uh, we never were really satisfied with what we worked out with the parents, but we terminated because they thought they'd had enough. And we did a year follow up, and we did a three year follow up, and she was still off drugs and I don't know what happened to her after that. She, I know she got married and had a child. But this is, uh, it's the typical way of approaching a case if you decide to take a family-oriented point of view with a problem young person, either crazy or addict, or whatever. And, uh, at some point here I'll show you the same approach with a, uh, psychotic of mine. It's a family with about six adult siblings, and the younger brother is the problem. He was arrested, uh, for smoking and dealing pot. And he was arrested about three times and now he's under court order, and, uh, the family we asked to come in together to deal with this problem. Older brother and mother came in, mother, the father has died in this family. Older brother and mother came in with this young man because the other siblings couldn't see any point to coming in. I mean, why would they come in if the kid smokes pot and got arrested? So, uh, part of the problem is persuading them to, uh, come in, and giving them a reason for coming in really is what you do. That is, you can just say to a family, "I want you to do something terrible to this guy if he takes dope again, and they, uh, will have difficulty accepting that. If you do it a step-by-step helping them realize that they should do this, then once they realize it they'll do it and they'll go through with it. One of the older brothers said, "I'll kill him if he does it." The older sister said, "He's out of my, he's out of my house the day he smokes a joint." Apparently he's living with her, and she said, "He's on the street. I'll move his stuff right out." And then they discussed for quite a while what serious consequence they should have, and they finally decided that they would shun him for three months if he took pot again. And they thought that was their idea, they didn't remember that it had some up in this session. And often that happens with people. They forget, uh, thanks to amnesia, and we would rather have the family solve it and resolve it themselves and keep it in the family. Often they just don't know anything they could do or whether they should. There's even ideology around they shouldn't do anything. So they don't. They leave it to the community, or the experts. And sometimes you let them come up with the consequence if there's a slip or relapse. Sometimes you come up with it if you can think of something that's appropriate. One of the things that was going on was the father was a very depressed guy and sighed a lot. And mother was a secret drinker. Everybody in the family told the therapist that mother was a secret drinker. And apparently what would happen is father came home from work, sighed, and went to bed about 9:30 or 10:00, and mother sat up and drank bourbon until she went to sleep and had been doing that for years. So, as we got the young man back to normal and going back to school and the family was uncertain about losing him, really, we wanted something else to focus on. So we focused on the, um, mother's drinking, partly to free the kids by getting the parents focused on something else except the kid. So, uh, we decided to make an issue of the drinking, and we decided to give a consequence if she took a drink ourselves rather than have them come up with a consequence. The husband was sitting in the kitchen having dinner and glass of wine, so she sat down and had a glass of wine with him. And the son came over at that point and threw such a temper tantrum it scared them about how they didn't take things seriously and by God when they stopped drinking they should stop drinking and this was an awful thing to do, and then went over and poured their wine down the sink. And then that was it, they didn't drink anymore, either one of them. So he was doing his duty, apparently. But, uh, any comments, issues around, uh, this is an example of a, of a consequence. It had its effects. Some of the places this idea came from was a guy somewhat comfortable with (inaudible [00:57:01). There's a case of Milton Erickson. I was visiting with him one time when he got a phone call, and I heard him say that the person, uh, "When you agreed, you stood on my front porch and you agreed," and then he chatted a bit and then he hung up the phone. So I asked him, "What was that about?," and he said, "That's an alcoholic who, uh, just called because his wife took all his clothes and packed them up and took them out of the house, and the guy said, 'I'm standing here in a towel calling you.'" And Erickson was reminding him that the guy had stood on his front porch and agreed that if he took one drink the wife would take all his clothes for a week. He wouldn't have a stitch of clothes, and he was calling to say that had happened. And so Erickson said, "Well, you agreed that this should happen," and the guy said, "Well I never thought she'd do it." So, taking off clothes can be a consequence in various con-, ver-, various contexts. But I wish you people would solve the problem of innovating because the field needs it, and as people get more strategic, it's expected of more people that they'll come up with plans, and procedures, and consequences, and so on, you know.

Excerpts from a Case of Physical Abuse From "Approaching a Crisis" Using the Actual Case Transcript (Enacted) 

00:58:15
[sil.] 

00:58:25
JAY HALEY The case was this: A mother called a therapist and said she was worried about her 10-year old son. He was behaving strangely, and she wanted therapy for him. The decision was who to interview first, the child, the mother, the father, or all of them? In this case, the therapist asked parents and child to come for the first interview. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN Dexter, can you go to the blackboard and write your name on the board so I won't forget it, please? 

00:58:55
JAY HADLEY The description of a problem boy in therapy can be a metaphor for what is happening in the family. One might suspect from this description by the mother that there is violence in the family. When the boy is said to be violent with girls, one might wonder about the violence of father. If one assumes this, a decision is whether to ask about it. If the goal is to have the husband not beat the wife, a circumspect approach is necessary. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN There are things that have to be said, right? Um, I've seen an attorney for a divorce. 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN And, um, you know, we're, my husband, we're talking about, you know, Dexter's feelings of insecurity, and his feeling inferior in things, and I attribute a lot of what's happening, um, with Dexter to this. I mean, he, he hasn't had a father literally for nine years. 

00:59:50
JAY HALEY The therapist finds himself in unexpected territory. It's not simply a child problem with the parents arguing about whether the father should do more with the child, which often happens. What is serious is the mother's mention that she has seen an attorney for a divorce. The therapist has to know what the marital situation is before dealing with the parents of the problem child. Should he immediately ask about the divorce and focus on that, or should he let them proceed with the boy's problem after the father's neglect? 

01:00:20
UNKNOWN Well, that's what I have always wanted is for him to have a relationship with his son regardless of what our relationship is. 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN Things are very, are strained right now? 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. Very strained. 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN And, and... 

01:00:30
JAY HALEY When a married couple arrives with the threat of separation, the therapist can encourage a separation or try to hold them together. It's impossible to be neutral and not influence the couple in one direction or another, even if one would like to believe that. Every statement and body movement of the therapist exerts an influence. As more information comes in, the decision might change. The therapist here defines the threat of divorce as indicating a strained relationship. That mild definition implies he will try to bring them together. At this point, should the therapist help the couple get together or get apart? 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN I, I've made up my mind about what has to be done. I've just got to have her. I have made up mind to that. 

01:01:20
UNKNOWN You, you got to have her to do what? 

01:01:20
UNKNOWN I, I've just got to have her. Yeah, I'll, I'll work on my son. I'll use him as a vehicle to, to pull us together. I mean, that, that way if we share something we'll have something together in-, instead of me, you know, wasting my time on something stupid on the computer that will soon become obsolete or whatever. 

01:01:40
JAY HALEY The therapist expected a routine child problem, and instead a more complex situation has arisen. The wife has filed for divorce while living with her husband, which can be dangerous since he is drinking and threatening suicide. Both husband and wife are nervous and upset. The boy's problem reflects this desperate circumstance. It seems possible that the boy's difficulties cannot be solved until the issue with the husband and wife is resolved. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN I'm very concerned and worried about him. He talks about, uh, committing suicide and says he's going to kill himself. Um, I had a bottle of tranquilizers and he said he took five. I didn't see him take the five he said he took, but he said he took them with some vodka, and, um, he keeps talking about suicide, and I'm very worried. Now, I don't know if it's all acting, if he's just trying to keep us together, or if he really would harm himself. I don't know. 

01:02:45
JAY HALEY The therapist must now decide how to deal with the suicide threat. Should he explore it and determine how real it is, enlarging the issue? Should he minimize it by trying to ignore it? Should he plan to hospitalize the man? To put him in the hospital could make him worse since it would affect him getting a job. Not to hospitalize him could mean the therapist would be liable if the man committed suicide. The therapist decides to make an usual approach. 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN Your wife just need to ask you something. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN Would you kill yourself if we got a divorce? 

01:03:25
UNKNOWN I, I would have no positive reason. I would care less about living. 

01:03:30
UNKNOWN Would you commit suicide? 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN You know, I, I did take those tranquilizers in the hope that I was going to get relief right away, the by-product of that being that I slept a little longer. I, I think, I think you'd have to be crazy to say, um, definitely I, you know, that I, I'm going to kill myself. 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN Would you kill yourself? You don't have to be crazy. 

01:03:55
JAY HALEY The man is aware that if he says he will kill himself in this mental health context he might be hospitalized involuntarily. His phrasing reflects this concern. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN ...job, I would probably seek relief any way I can, probably drink too much. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN You already drink too much. That hasn't helped anything. I guess the biggest issue is that I'm afraid of him. If I talk to him in a certain tone of voice, I get a punch in the arm. Um, if, you know, I, you know, he, he drinks a lot, and he's hit me for the past 13 years, even before we got married. And, you know, um, one night he came home, and he got a strap out of the closet, and he started beating me with the strap. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN How many times did he hit you? 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN With the strap? 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN I couldn't tell you. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN Four times. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN Hmmmm. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN You don't know. I know. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN I, I've been ashamed of it ever since. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN It was not four times. It was more than four times. He kept saying, "One more time. One more time." 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN Hmmm. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN Anyway, that scared the hell out of me. 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN And I'm, I'm terribly ashamed of it. 

01:05:10
UNKNOWN Let me finish. The next day, I tried to talk to him about this and he says, you know, he says it's a way of ex-, of ex-, expressing passion, and you know, to me, this is sick. So, the next night he comes home and he goes to the closet and he gets the strap, and he says, "Are you ready?". And I said, "Ready for what?" And then I see that he has this strap and, and I ran as fast as I could. I don't know where I got the energy to run as fast as I did, but I ran and I had to run all the way to one of my neighbor's home. And, you know, I don't know when he's going to come home, and I don't know what condition he's going to come home in. And, you know, when he, when he drives up I get this pain, this horrible pain in my chest. And I get this pain in my stomach, and you know, you can't live like that. You know, I, I'm, I'm really afraid of him and it's not just his drinking. He has a bad, bad temper. 

01:06:15
JAY HALEY For some therapists, the episodes of violence would be enough to decide the couple should separate. The therapist making that decision would also have to prevent possible violence resulting from the separation. Other therapists might think the couple could eliminate the violence. This therapist thought in terms of first trying to hold the couple together. He talked to them about the possibilities of working out issues between them, especially the violence. 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN How long have you two not slept together? 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN Two weeks. 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN Two weeks. 

01:06:50
UNKNOWN Not very long. 

01:06:50
JAY HALEY This information, too, must be considered by the therapist deciding whether or not to encourage a divorce. The therapist is concerned about the possibility of saving the marriage, but he's also concerned with helping the couple separate safely. 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN That, that's a good idea. 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN Well, I don't want to give my husband false hope. I feel like I've made up my mind. 

01:07:10
UNKNOWN Well, you know, food for thought, how can you think about divorcing me when you're still living with me? 

01:07:15
UNKNOWN Still live with you? What do you mean? Where am I supposed to go until this thing is settled? 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN Look, that's one of the things that we need to talk about, just those kinds of things. 

01:07:25
JAY HALEY The therapist interviewed the couple an hour a day for the next two days. After the third interview, he felt he was not producing a change in the wife's determination to separate despite the improvement of the couple. He was concerned about the husband's drinking and violence. It was a provoking and dangerous situation for the wife to threaten divorce while living in the same home with a man with a history of violence. He consulted with me about the situation. I suggested that he see the wife alone and ask her about the divorce. If she was still determined to divorce, he should have her take her child and move out of the house that day. The therapist interviewed the wife alone to discuss this. 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN That getting a divorce or continuing with your husband is really up to you. 

01:08:15
Three Days Later 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN Now, we've been meeting at this for several times now, and... 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:08:20
UNKNOWN But, I, I really think it's time that, that, that I asked you what you, what you want to do. 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN Uh, my plans are the same. I'm going to continue with the divorce. 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN So you're going to continue with the divorce? 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Henry's been making all sorts of promises, um, promising all sorts of things, and, you know, I, I... He says that, um, I would change my mind if I, if I just see the changes that he's making, but I really don't think that I would change my mind. 

01:08:50
JAY HALEY When the wife is firm in her decision, the therapist must help her with the separation in a way that is best for everyone. As she gets more definite, she will have doubts. For years she has been unable to leave her husband even when she wished to, and even when he hit her. So it could be expected that the separation would not occur easily. The therapist will have to hold her firm because isolation could provoke the husband and be dangerous. 

01:09:15
UNKNOWN I, I'd be very grateful if you would continue helping him, you know? 

01:09:20
UNKNOWN Well, uh, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be right here with you, and, and for your son, and, and for Henry. Now, I'm going to ask you something, and it might sound drastic, but it's, it's really going to help you, all right? You're going to have to pack up your things, and take yourself and your son, and go. 

01:09:45
UNKNOWN Um, the only place I could go is to my mother and father's. 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN I thought maybe we could stay in the same house, you know, until it was final and then, um, and then I could sell the house and then I'd have some money to go live where I wanted to with my child. 

01:10:10
UNKNOWN No, um, I don't think, I don't think it can be that way. 

01:10:10
JAY HALEY Who should tell the husband that his wife is moving out? The wife could do so since it is her decision, or the therapist could do so since he advised her to leave. Or, wife and therapist together could present it to the husband. The decision here was to have the husband see the therapist alone and tell him. The therapist has intervened in their lives and he should take the brunt of the husband's emotional upset which can be expected. After escorting the wife to his office, the therapist brought the husband in. He had the difficult task of telling a desperate man that his wife is not only leaving him, but moving out that day. To make the problem more difficult, the husband entered cheerfully, still believing things were going to work out. 

01:11:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, I appreciate your staying until after 5:00. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN That's okay, you know, it's my job to do this. Um, I'm, I'm concerned, um, about your wife and about you and your son. I'm, I'm, I'm very concerned about how your wife is feeling. 

01:11:15
UNKNOWN Sure. 

01:11:15
UNKNOWN Together tomorrow, uh, to talk over some of these things, right? And, and, and your wife has really made up her mind that, that she wants to leave. 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN The house? 

01:11:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:11:30
UNKNOWN Oh, could, could I, could I stand up here? I'm, oh I'm really upset. You mean leave the house? 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN Be-, before the divorce is over. You, you mean leave the house? Yeah, maybe I should just sit down. 

01:11:45
UNKNOWN Well, wh-, sh-, sh-, she, she's left the house before, right? 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, but I, but I understood that. I mean, this time it'd be my fault, and, and it'd be the end. But did she really say she was going to leave the house, too? 

01:12:00
JAY HALEY The therapist must ultimately admit to the husband that he advised the wife to leave that day. Besides the personal reluctance to tell him, the therapist can be concerned about antagonizing the man so that he leaves. He would then lose what support he had from the therapist. 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Your wife has filed for divorce. 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah that I know, and that can dropped within three months if I just tell her what I'm going to do. And I intend to do that. You know, I mean, when she's not there, I, I'm in bad shape, you know? I just, I need to go out and drink just to be around people, you know? But, you know, I, I think she's wrong there. We need, we need to work this out together. 

01:12:40
UNKNOWN You know, I, I agree that, that you, you need to solve this problem together. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Right. Right. Ugh, you know, I feel like I'm in an elevator and the door, and the doors have just shut, you know? I'm on, I'm on the 21st floor and I'm all alone. 

01:12:55
UNKNOWN Mmm-hmm. 

01:12:55
UNKNOWN And they're, and they're all gone, and I'm actually like having a phobia here, you know, like frightened to death. 

01:13:05
UNKNOWN Talk like I'm not even here, Henry. I'm here. 

01:13:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, well, I, I appreciate what you're trying to do for me here. 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN I, I've told Henry about the decision that, that you've made about getting the, the distance or the room between the both of you, um, for the time being. I'm not sure how long you want to do this or how it's going to be. That depends on a lot of things. 

01:13:30
UNKNOWN I don't, I don't know how, you know? Well, forgive me but I don't... when that happens, I don't know. I just don't have an answer for that. 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN You don't have an answer to what, Henry? 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN You know, I, I can do without her sex. I, I can give you more room in the house. Just be there. You know, somebody to come home to. 

01:13:55
UNKNOWN Okay, can you tell Henry what, um, where, where you're going to be? 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN At my father's. 

01:14:00
UNKNOWN I don't want your pity. I want your love. I mean, my alternative, you know? I don't have any. 

01:14:10
UNKNOWN Okay, okay. You do have one, you know? 

01:14:15
UNKNOWN What's that? 

01:14:15
UNKNOWN There's some distance between you and she, and she's living in, in a separate place, somewhere else for a while, and, and, and that you know how to reach her. 

01:14:25
UNKNOWN That's not solving the problem. That's running away from the problem. That's not giving me a chance. 

01:14:30
JAY HALEY The therapist's task is to hold the wife in her position while the husband is being so persuasive. 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN And, and I promise you there'll be no, no drinking, and I prefer to cut out the drugs, too. That you just give me that two months, and I think you've done right by everybody. Our marriage is destroyed. The house is gone. The child is gone. The job is gone. I, I guarantee that. You owe it to yourself. You know that you owe it to the family. You owe it to the child. You owe it to me. You know, I, I think that you, you owe it to God. 

01:15:20
UNKNOWN Now he, now he's really holding you on this now. 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, uh, only because I don't have any other alternative. 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN The alternative is, Henry, that you take care of your son as a father should, and that you try to win back your wife. 

01:15:30
JAY HALEY The interview ended with the wife leaving to pack and go with her child to her parents home. The therapist talked with the man for a while. The dilemma for the therapist is what to do with this man for that night. The man is threatening suicide, has been abandoned by his wife, is losing his job, and he must go home alone to an empty house with the electricity turned off. The man had no friends or family in the area to turn to. The decisions of the therapist might range from professional to personal actions. The therapist could telephone him that evening and make sure he was all right. Or, he could try to get him into a hospital as a suicidal risk. Instead, the therapist did something controversial. He went out drinking with the man that night. The next morning he met with a more cheerful couple. The unorthodox evening out seemed to be the turning point in the therapy. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN Went out last night. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I heard. 

01:16:30
The Next Day 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, we talked about alot of things, uh, right? 

01:16:35
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah, there was almost no continuity to it, but we talked a lot. 

01:16:40
UNKNOWN Henry, Henry is a very interesting person. Uh, I felt very comfortable with him. 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, we had a good time. I mean, I told him, I told him that we'd be buddies for a thousand years. 

01:16:50
JAY HALEY The couple negotiated the issues of the separation. The therapist continued to see the family over a period of weeks. The boy improved, and the husband and wife survived the separation and the divorce. A year later the husband had married again. The wife had not.
