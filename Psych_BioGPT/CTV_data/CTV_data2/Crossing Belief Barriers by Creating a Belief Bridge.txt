Crossing Belief Barriers 

00:00:35
by Creating a Belief Bridge 

00:00:35
Robert Dilts 

00:00:35
ROBERT DILTS  Demonstration around the issue of crossing or transforming belief barriers by creating a belief bridge. This is, you know, an example of, for me, the kind of things we would do in brief therapy, so its intention is to be brief work with beliefs. Now, for me, having my background in NLP, or neuro-linguistic programming, beliefs are a classic example of a neuro-linguistic program, or belief is something -- it's a form of a program that can have a tremendous influence on the way that we act, the way that we think, what motivates us, how we interpret things around us. So I'd say belief is a -- it's a kind of a program, it's a program because beliefs generally are not something that we are born with, they're something that we develop, that we learn, sometimes through our life experiences, but also sometimes through beliefs that are passed on to us through our families, through our media, through our culture et cetera. From the NLP perspective, maybe it's just important to say that, you know, we say there are different types of neuro-linguistic programs, first of all, we have sort of our interaction with our environment, we have our senses, we see, we hear, we feel, and we also, of course, have our behaviors and relationship to that environment, so there's -- what we do in reaction and relationship to the world around us. Then we would say where your kind of neuro-linguistic programming, if you will, really starts, is at the level of our cognitive abilities or our thinking strategies. We plan, we learnt a language, we learn whatever to read, we learn math, et cetera, these are certain kinds of thinking strategies. We also learn to make decisions to be creative, to remember et cetera. So there are strategies that we use to develop. These would be, what we call, in NLP, a cognitive strategy. These cognitive strategies, however, are not our deepest level of programming, then we get into this area that we would call our beliefs and our values, which are deeper. If we say that the environment is about where and when our behaviors about what we do on the where and when, our capabilities are about how we think, and you know, what we've -- what way we've learned to interact and address that world around us. Our beliefs and values are generally about why, we would say, why I do something, so they're related to motivation on one hand; and on the other side, permission. Am I allowed to, is it okay, what should I do, shouldn't I do. Beliefs are generally, we would say, programs relating to cause an effect and meaning. So they are -- they are -- and essentially a type of mentor program you could even say. They open doors or close doors to other things, meaning if I don't believe in something, if I don't believe that I can do it, I generally won't even try. The three main belief issues that you typically come -- come across in therapy and especially in brief therapy we would say are, are those related to, is it possible to do something, am I able to do something and do I deserve it. When we don't believe it's possible, we say the opposite of belief it's possible is hopeless. The opposite of the belief that I'm capable is helpless and the opposite of the belief that I deserve it is worthless. So these are usually the barriers. When we talk about belief barrier, we encounter them in the form of hopeless, helpless, worthless, and of course, sometimes all three. So the flip side of that is going to be it's possible, so a sense of hope or optimism, I'm capable, a sense of confidence or capability, and I deserve it, a sense of self-worth et cetera. So generally these are the types of belief issues that will emerge as we are working with people. Now generally in terms of the application of belief to brief therapy, there -- usually beliefs come up as a barrier. Somebody says I want to be able to do something, or I'm trying to do it, or I wish I could change, but something stops me, something is in the way. And part of what we want to do is to be able to find that barrier. I like to say that in a way the sort of brief therapy way of working with beliefs is a little bit like the recipe for tigers do. Step one, catch the tiger, right. Where is the tiger? Now often times what we find and -- that's why we say these things are neuro-linguistic programs that is clearly often a linguistic aspect, beliefs are generally expressed verbally. You know, if then, if I do this then that will happen, or I can't, because, you know, there is because or something like that, there are reasons, there is cause and an effect, there is a this and it means that. However, the belief itself is not necessarily a verbal structure. It is often has a somatic structure. So we say it's neuro-linguistic, it's not just linguistic. We can say things that we don't believe, right, so we can easily form a belief or say something and it doesn't mean that we believe it. So generally when we do believe something, it's because it has entered into a more somatic part of our reality. So beliefs are something that are held, not only cognitively and verbally, but somatically, and in fact, that's where why you get some of these very interesting issues where people will say, logically I know this isn't true, but and then, you know, we still have the experience. As you, you know, I'm sure would might imagine most of the key beliefs or many of the core beliefs these lives are formed in early childhood and many times they are formed even pre-verbally, so it's not that the belief itself even began as a set of words, it begins as some kind of -- set of, you know, I see something and I have a fear or a feeling. Sometimes, in fact, beliefs are even transmitted in a completely non-verbal way and I think you probably all aware of some of the recent research in the area of mirror neurons, where simply being in the presence of somebody else, their behaviors actually partially represented in our own brain and nervous system by these mirror neurons, so it is that -- a simple example would be, you take a monkey, put a monkey in an environment and it's exploring the environment, and maybe when it reaches for a certain object, you spray it with cold water, so it gets a negative reinforcement and pretty soon it learns not to touch that. After you do that, you bring a second monkey in, now the second monkey has never been sprayed, it's never seen anybody being sprayed, doesn't know anything about it. The second monkey is curious, begins to explore and when it begins to approach the -- that the object, the first monkey reacts like, you know, they say usually it throws -- shows a threatening face and a fearful posture. Now the second monkey is not -- the first monkey isn't saying anything to the second monkey verbally and nor is it touching or doing anything physically to the second monkey, there's just the second monkey picks up the "energy", the reaction of the first monkey and avoids that object. And they say even when the first monkey is taken out of the room, the second monkey still avoids that object. It doesn't know why, it's an unconscious, in a sense, we would say belief. It's not that the second monkey has gone through an analytical process, it's more directly sort of receiving emotion and behavior just through the fact that something is in the environment. So all this is just to say that a number of our beliefs are not necessarily held consciously or cognitively and this is why we say we got to catch the tiger, where is that tiger? And that's first part of this whole process of finding the belief barrier. What you'll see in this particular demo that we're going to do is that you don't find it through necessarily a logical cognitive analysis. We don't even find it generally through trying to explore verbally the issues, we're actually going to look for it somatically. We're going to find where does something shift in the -- in the physical reaction, the physical responses. So it's often very interesting and when I'm working with people around these kinds of issues or beliefs, very often the person thinks that the belief is in a certain area and they have all kinds of stories and all kinds of reasons, but you'll find that that's not where the belief actually is. Now the reason to know where the belief actually is, is because when we make the belief bridge, we want to be able to make the bridge around or over, over in a sense we're going to be transforming whatever the limiting belief is, where that barrier is. So we need to sort of know where is the barriers, so we know how to get around it or through it. So in this particular case now from the perspective of brief therapy, we are not going to try to explore that belief in any big detail, the limiting belief, we're not going to try to actually even do something to change it. What we're simply going to do is to say there are other beliefs in a belief system, what is the -- the idea of a belief bridge is, is it's what is it that would allow me to perform to act effectively and resourcefully anyway. So even though the limiting belief is there, even though -- let's -- maybe I have this belief, I can't do something or it's dangerous to do something, the belief bridge would be, well, what would allow you to go ahead and do it anyway. What would allow you to be -- you know, what's the belief that will support you to be able to act resourcefully, effectively, continue to move even though this other belief is there. And very often, of course, what you find is that through this there is a kind of reframing process that happens where the new belief -- it's not -- it's not against the old belief, it doesn't try to break or fight the old belief, you will see how this works, we sort of call it more like an out frame, it out frames the old belief, so that we're able to move forward resourcefully. It is not, of course, the only way that you -- certainly it's not the only way we work with the beliefs in NLP. It's not the only way you would work with beliefs in general with people. However, in a brief therapy session and a coaching session, if one of these barriers comes up, it's actually a very, you know, can be very quick and sometimes very powerful way to help people continue to move through, move towards their goals. So I'd like to demonstrate that. Well, it's probably easier to show how it works. To do this, we don't sit and talk about it. We actually do what, in NLP, we call spatial sorting and usually where you're going to find that you want to use this kind of approach is where somebody has a context where they need to be effective, resourceful, you know, able to do something or act or react appropriately in a certain context and they know that they can because they do it in other situations, right. So it's like, well, I can do it in other places, but I can't do it here, something stops me here. So it's not that I'm unable to, so it's not an issue of knowing where, when, what or how. So this way it's important to kind of think about these other levels. It's not an issue what the person says, I don't know what to do. They say, I know what I should do, I know what I want to do, I have the resources, I know I have them, but somehow they are shut down or they are blocked in this context. So that's where we would want to work. Now to do the demo, I mean, we probably all have these ourselves. I -- you know, I find, as a therapist, as a coach, as a therapist, people have a lot of resources, they can handle things, they can often deal with things very effectively. Let's say, if it's their client or if it's, you know, in a particular environment, then they get with, you know, their own mother or you get with your intimate partner and it seems like everything goes out the door or you get into some other situation and we begin to shut down or panic or something like this. So this is the kind of place where you want to -- where we -- we realize it must be a belief barrier because we know it's not that we don't have the knowledge, we know that it's not that we lack the capability because we demonstrated it over and over in other situations. So that's why we say it's got to be some kind of barrier and usually it's something that we're not aware of. So I'd like to do this as a demonstration and are you volunteering, or you have a quick -- okay, you come on up. You have to sign a little thing here but -- you don't even have to ask, you are reading my mind, okay, I guess it's a demonstration, we know what we're doing here. So how many of you have -- have had some previous background with NLP in some way, please. So some of you. How many of you with this sort of your first experience or exposure to that? Okay. What's the good first exposure? Hopefully, you'll find interesting and useful what you -- what you are able to observe here. And, again, realize it's one -- it's a one demo, it's one way of looking at working with beliefs. We have -- I've written actually several books on the whole issue of working with beliefs and belief systems. So this, for me, is, is in particular around this area of -- of more of a brief therapy context where we're looking -- we're keeping a solution focus. Hello. 

00:15:10
CRAWFORD Hi. 

00:15:10
ROBERT DILTS Hi. So -- and it's Crawford, Crawford, that's a wonderful name, maybe yeah, you can. And then this probably -- put that part in your pocket or something like that, because I think probably to hold it in your hands, we're going to -- be using -- Okay, now our major issue we have, not only belief barriers up here, but we have other barriers that we have to contend with. But let's maybe come here to where we have a little bit more open focus. And so, first of all, one of the key things that I -- I like to do before we start anything and I know it's a bit strange to move from that position to this position and you're in the bright lights. So before we start anything, I always like to do just sort of create a little bit of a -- our own let's say a container relationship here of connection and safety. So there is usually several things I like to check that's a little bit like my analogy is sometimes like before you take off in an airplane, if you're a pilot, you go through a -- your checklist. So, first just to be centered and ground here, so that we're both -- we're both centered and we're both grounded, and I am centered. 

00:16:30
CRAWFORD I'm -- 

00:16:30
ROBERT DILTS You're centered? 

00:16:30
CRAWFORD I'm trying. 

00:16:30
ROBERT DILTS Trying, getting there. That's good. So take a breath, yeah, yeah. It's better? Yeah. So, we sometimes say, you know, maybe I'm not fully centered, but I'm centering. 

00:16:45
CRAWFORD Yep, I'm okay. 

00:16:45
ROBERT DILTS Good, yeah. And then usually like to sort of also be open, so as open in the heart, open to what we're going to explore. So I'm also open. 

00:16:55
CRAWFORD I am. 

00:16:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. Especially now at this time of the afternoon, it's good to be awake and alert. 

00:17:00
CRAWFORD I'm very awake. 

00:17:00
ROBERT DILTS I'm awake and alert. And then a sense of being connected, connected to ourselves personally but also then connected to each other, and of course, we have an audience here, so a sense of connection. So I'm feeling pretty connected. 

00:17:15
CRAWFORD Yeah, I'm okay. 

00:17:15
ROBERT DILTS Okay. And then for me sort of the last thing is then to be ready to sort of ready to explore together. For me, to be ready to completely support you in whatever sorts of issues arise for you and to be here as your coach and guide, and for you to be ready to hold to meet also what comes for you, so I'm ready. 

00:17:35
CRAWFORD I'm ready. 

00:17:35
ROBERT DILTS Good. So now what we're going to do is let's start with where is the situation, where -- I mean, you are ready to volunteer -- 

00:17:45
CRAWFORD Yes. 

00:17:45
ROBERT DILTS Even though it's a little bit -- 

00:17:45
CRAWFORD Perfect for-- 

00:17:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:17:45
CRAWFORD My issue is -- 

00:17:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, so say a little bit about that. 

00:17:50
CRAWFORD Okay. I ride horses and I particularly focus in show jumping and I'm quite competent rider and show jumper, but I have performance anxiety. So I can train, I can -- I'm quite capable, but I -- when I get to a show, I don't perform very well and it's not about winning, it's I get very anxious 

00:18:10
ROBERT DILTS  Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. 

00:18:15
CRAWFORD And I'm uncomfortable. 

00:18:15
ROBERT DILTS Actually you're absolutely right. That's -- I mean, that's a really great example of this type of thing that we're saying. 

00:18:20
CRAWFORD Exactly. 

00:18:20
ROBERT DILTS So, now here is the first step. The -- always the beginning and this is kind of probably the most -- in a certain way, each step has its own little challenges. But this was kind of challenging because what we first want to do is to bring awareness to that what we would say as the present state, that is in NLP, we say we need to get a little bit of a sense of sort of the current program, you know, what happens now. So instead of -- instead of being, you know, calm and confident and we would say sort of in your zone of best performance, you're not. So what we're going to do and this is the way we do this with NLP is we're going to, first, find a location where I'm going to ask you sort of step into that and put yourself back into that situation. I mean, you know, obviously best -- best kind of coaching environment is that when we have the real thing happening -- 

00:19:10
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:19:10
ROBERT DILTS But since we don't have horses here, we do have an audience but not a horse. But what we would do is to kind of put yourself there and what we would say in NLP is you kind of want to try to associate to what happens, see what you see, hear what you hear, feel what you feel in that moment just so that you get a sense. And the purpose of this is not for you to just experience anxiety again, it's to experience what happens with a new degree of awareness. So you're experiencing it, but at the same time there is a certain awareness of what's happening. And then we also share a little bit and it gives me also a chance to sort of observe what happens spontaneously, you know, as you think about it, you probably -- your body will also respond a little bit. 

00:19:55
CRAWFORD Okay. 

00:19:55
ROBERT DILTS So kind of when you're ready, a step forward and just here is the place where you would be -- so you say, okay, here is what happens, I'm riding or I'm there in the performance. 

00:20:05
ROBERT DILTS If it doesn't interfere with it. 

00:20:05
CRAWFORD That doesn't interfere -- 

00:20:10
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:10
CRAWFORD Okay. I get very distracted and very focused on all the activity going on around me. 

00:20:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:20
CRAWFORD I seem to be really aware of other people's energy and -- 

00:20:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:25
CRAWFORD Their anxiety and nervousness, and I just seem to -- 

00:20:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:30
CRAWFORD Take it in. My heart -- 

00:20:30
ROBERT DILTS  Yeah, yeah. I also have a heart. 

00:20:35
CRAWFORD Really, really excel, increases -- 

00:20:35
ROBERT DILTS  Increases. 

00:20:40
CRAWFORD Dramatically. 

00:20:40
ROBERT DILTS Alright. 

00:20:40
CRAWFORD I'm not worried about what I'm going to look like, I don't care really what other people are thinking about me, which is unusual. 

00:20:45
ROBERT DILTS  So it's more -- it's more like -- 

00:20:50
CRAWFORD It's an internal reaction -- 

00:20:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:50
CRAWFORD To the physiological responses I'm having -- 

00:20:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:20:55
CRAWFORD I don't respond well to it. 

00:20:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So we assume that your heart beatings, something about your awareness going out there. Now you said something about I take it in and you're making this gesture, do you have sensations? 

00:21:05
CRAWFORD Lots of -- yeah, like that the heart -- I don't get sweaty or anything like that but I -- it's mainly my heart. It just seems to -- 

00:21:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:21:15
CRAWFORD And my breathing. 

00:21:15
ROBERT DILTS  Your breath? 

00:21:20
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:21:20
ROBERT DILTS What happens -- 

00:21:20
CRAWFORD And my mind and then like -- 

00:21:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:21:20
CRAWFORD Thinking deteriorates. 

00:21:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:21:20
CRAWFORD  Yep. 

00:21:25
ROBERT DILTS You'd be glad to know there's a -- 

00:21:25
CRAWFORD So all the good thinking and all the good things that I know go out the window. 

00:21:30
ROBERT DILTS We -- we call that crashing. 

00:21:30
CRAWFORD Yeah. I've -- 

00:21:30
ROBERT DILTS  Well, we actually -- 

00:21:35
CRAWFORD I know. 

00:21:35
ROBERT DILTS Literally we say this for crash, it's contracted, reactive and kind of analysis, paralysis and -- 

00:21:40
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:21:40
ROBERT DILTS So -- so, and again, part of the reason that we -- and we can even sort of observe a little bit as Crawford is doing this, it's not just that she's caught right back in the anxiety, there is actually now you have a kind of awareness of what happens and you may have already had that too. But this is -- so, and part of the value of awareness with respect to this idea of programming is that when you can actually be aware of it, there's something in you that's aware of it that is more than it, right. So there is -- there is the program and then you can actually witness the program and not have to be in it. And that becomes valuable, because then it actually begins to give you a possibility for choice. If you're not aware of it, there is no choice. It's just what happens. But here you can go, okay, there is my -- there is my attention is going out, there is this kind of, you know, what my heart is beating, there's this kind of inner sensations, I'm going blank inside. 

00:22:35
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:22:35
ROBERT DILTS Anything else that seems to be important about this? 

00:22:35
CRAWFORD Sometimes I'm very visual to -- 

00:22:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:22:40
CRAWFORD So I have a -- I'll stop thinking and I'll -- and even feel what it's like when I -- when I physically crash. 

00:22:45
ROBERT DILTS When you physically crash? 

00:22:50
CRAWFORD When I physically fall off the horse. 

00:22:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:22:50
CRAWFORD When I have in the past. So I'll go into -- once I'm into that -- 

00:22:55
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, yeah, okay. So that's -- well we say that's another aspect here kind of be in another, it's almost like programming yourself to fail, even though that's exactly what you don't want to do. 

00:23:05
CRAWFORD And I'm going to fail if I think like that. 

00:23:05
ROBERT DILTS  Yeah. So that's what happens. That's good to know. It's not good to happen, but it's good to know what happens. So now what we're going to do is to step out of that and here is -- so now the next step is, instead of sort of being in it and kind of running it and observing it, really take a moment to completely say, okay. Remember we said that the great thing about awareness is you can go, oh, yeah, I know that, I'm aware that that does happen to me. There is a program that I can run, I mean, this is -- this is what we call a neuro-linguistic program, I can do it and when I -- you know exactly what to do. 

00:23:45
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:23:45
ROBERT DILTS In order to create -- 

00:23:45
CRAWFORD Good. 

00:23:45
ROBERT DILTS This and this and this and this. So that's what happens, but you're also more than that, right. That's not all of you. 

00:23:55
CRAWFORD No. 

00:23:55
ROBERT DILTS So here you can, oh, yeah, I'm aware that that does happen, but that's not all of me, that's a program and I think that's important to realize. It's not me, this is when that program runs, that's what happens to me. But the program is not me. It's some -- you know, I have more choices than that. And, in fact, here you know this is where we are saying we can, you know, is centered, open, aware, connected and I'm curious to now explore the desired state, which would be how would you rather be in that situation and -- and again, not just to -- not just the idea of it, but we want to really get the expression of it, the experience of it, what it feels like, what it looks like, what it sounds like. So you really bring it alive inside of you. 

00:24:40
CRAWFORD Okay. Well, when I'm training, because I'm perfectly fine when I'm training -- 

00:24:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:24:45
CRAWFORD I'm focused on the technical aspects of riding and what's happening with the horse. I'm focused more on the partnership with the horse. 

00:24:55
ROBERT DILTS  Yeah. 

00:25:00
CRAWFORD And it's really -- it can be fun and thrilling. 

00:25:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So it's fun and thrilling? 

00:25:05
CRAWFORD Yeah. 

00:25:05
ROBERT DILTS What's different? And if we take the things that were happening there, what's different in your heart? 

00:25:10
CRAWFORD It's not beating as -- it might be beating a little bit faster because it's adrenaline. 

00:25:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:25:15
CRAWFORD But I'm okay with it beating a little bit faster. 

00:25:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:25:20
CRAWFORD It's manageable. 

00:25:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. And what about your breath? 

00:25:25
CRAWFORD It -- oh, well, when I'm in that state too, as I'm going around the course -- 

00:25:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:25:30
CRAWFORD I'm remembering to breath between the jumps -- I'll hold my breath -- 

00:25:35
ROBERT DILTS Hold your breath -- 

00:25:35
CRAWFORD In that space. 

00:25:35
ROBERT DILTS We often like to say fear is just excitement without the breath, okay. 

00:25:40
CRAWFORD So I'm not breathing there. I'm breathing -- 

00:25:40
ROBERT DILTS You got to breath -- yeah, you're breathing. And so that energy is not becoming morbid. I mean, it's -- what it that -- 

00:25:45
CRAWFORD Yeah. 

00:25:45
ROBERT DILTS  And your awareness is in a different place and what -- but you -- 

00:25:50
CRAWFORD Completely. 

00:25:50
ROBERT DILTS And you're inner imagery, what's different in your inner imagery? 

00:25:55
CRAWFORD I'm not thinking crush and burn. 

00:25:55
ROBERT DILTS  Yeah. 

00:26:00
CRAWFORD I'm thinking -- I'm not thinking anything about that at all. 

00:26:00
ROBERT DILTS Exactly. 

00:26:00
CRAWFORD Actually I'm focused on what I'm doing. 

00:26:05
ROBERT DILTS Exactly. It's beautiful. Beautiful example by the way what you would call from a perspective what is known as the inner game -- inner game of what in coaching, they talk about the inner game and the outer game. And the key part of the inner game is to be in what's called the inner zone of excellence. So in that inner zone, there is confidence -- confidence without arrogance. There is this notion of just -- your focus is just on performing beautifully and excellently. So it's -- and what we call it an effortless excellence. So you're able to perform without thinking. So it sounds like you can be in your zone -- 

00:26:35
CRAWFORD  Yes. 

00:26:40
ROBERT DILTS When you are practicing. So kind of really put yourself in that place and say, well, I -- you know that well as well. You know this place of being resourceful, of being -- being your best. So kind of take a moment and do that. 

00:26:55
CRAWFORD Okay. 

00:26:55
ROBERT DILTS Now also by the way if –- if as you are observing and I'm just feeling you want to know how I'm looking, I'm able to see from Crawford's posture and her way of standing and breathing, she looks quite different than when she is putting herself in that situation. So even though we're not physically in these real life situations, we can see that there is a program that that's there and your body responds appropriately to these programs. So now we're going to do a little tiger hunting, because basically that the -- you know, because this is the big mystery is what you want to be able to do is you want to do this in that situation, right. So that's -- that seems simple, right. Why and we just do this there. Now here is what we do the tiger hunting. What we're going to do, and again, of course, this is because we're not in the real situation, we're going to have to use a certain level of imagination and somatic kind of, what we would say, somatic modeling here, but what I'm going to be asking you to do in just a moment is to hold this state and literally physically begin to walk as if you're going to be going into that situation. You're going to bring all of these -- you know, this program, if you will, this way of being there, but what I'm going to invite you to do and I'll help you, because I'll also be observing you is, as you start to bring it there, if there's some place maybe your breathing begins to shift a little bit, maybe something begins to happen, so rather than think about it, right, you're just holding your awareness on the experience. But as soon as anything happens that begins to shift it, pause -- I mean we're going to pause immediately there and that's where we're going to look for -- for the tiger, okay. 

00:28:45
CRAWFORD I can already see it. 

00:28:45
ROBERT DILTS  You can already see it. Well, let's -- well, let's go find it then. So let's take a moment and let's -- because seeing it is one thing and we'll go and -- so really take a moment and sort of really before you even bring your attention to that situation -- 

00:29:05
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:29:05
ROBERT DILTS Just come to what you know that you can do and you know you can be that you are resourceful, you are able to perform well, excellently. And then as you hold that, it's like you're going to begin to move towards that situation and any -- as soon -- right, yeah, so I'm right here. 

00:29:30
CRAWFORD Yep. I immediately I'm remembering -- 

00:29:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:29:30
CRAWFORD And also I can feel it as I get physically really rigid. 

00:29:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So this is certain kind of rigidity that -- 

00:29:40
CRAWFORD Really, yeah. 

00:29:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, begins to happen here. 

00:29:45
CRAWFORD Yeah. Yep in my shoulders. 

00:29:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So here's what we're going to do. Instead of trying to like change it and get rid of it, actually stay with that for a moment, because that's your gateway to the belief, right. So this was not -- and I think for you, it wasn't like cognitively thinking, oh, I want to stiffen my shoulders now, but this is something that begins to happen. 

00:30:00
CRAWFORD  Yep. 

00:30:05
ROBERT DILTS But as you bring your awareness there, there's clearly something that's going on here. 

00:30:10
CRAWFORD I'm saying, I'm going to die. 

00:30:10
ROBERT DILTS I'm going to die? Yeah, that's an interesting thing to think, right. So, I know, I mean, and of course it sounds, you're saying, okay does it sound particularly logical. But what I'd like to ask you do is just to rather than think about it, or judge it, to just sort of stay with whatever that sensation of the stiffening up is and there's these words, I'm going to die. And of course, to explore how do you know that. This is where the -- really the belief part remembers, that is always about causing effect or like what -- how do I know I will die or how will I die. What is that -- what is that about? And again, what my happen is there maybe more words, there maybe other images, it may just sort of be something that comes. 

00:30:55
CRAWFORD It's very physical. I can feel my neck getting tied. 

00:31:00
ROBERT DILTS Tied? Yeah. 

00:31:00
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:31:00
ROBERT DILTS So, by the way, part of what we see here is that beliefs tend to manifest not so much lot rationally and logically, but somatically. And they are often in this particular case too, usually go very deep into our survival strategies. So now, if you were to keep your attention there on the thing in your neck and your shoulders, how do you know that you will die or, I mean, what is that's going to kill you here, and how do you know that is, I mean, and I'm not saying to think logically about it, but just to listen to feel inside, what does it feel like? 

00:31:40
CRAWFORD  It's just really, I can't articulate that's where I -- that's why I keep failing, because I can understand it logically, it's just like a freeze. 

00:31:55
ROBERT DILTS Freeze? Which by the way, one of the three basic survival strategies, fight, flight, and freeze. I'm going to die, freeze. And it's very powerful, but what I also understand is that it's a thought. It's kind of a part of you that is not part of your typical, regular conscious or waking state, consciousness. It's this other thought that comes there, this is almost like a -- it's not you thinking it in a certain way, not that you that we would say is our -- our conscious ego self, it's this other -- but it's there, it's there. Do you have any pictures associated with that, I mean, do you have memories, does it associated with memories of almost dying. And it doesn't have to be, I mean, I'm just curious if we are just with that, because here is the idea of bringing awareness to it, rather than trying to change it, get rid of it, fight it, judge it, humiliate it, we just want to bring awareness into this aspect of this very consistent, very powerful thought, but it's not just a thought, it's also a strong somatic response. 

00:33:00
CRAWFORD Yeah, I can. 

00:33:00
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, what -- do you have memory did you say? 

00:33:05
CRAWFORD I'm linking it to a previous experience. 

00:33:10
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:33:10
CRAWFORD Nothing to do with horses. 

00:33:10
ROBERT DILTS Nothing to do with horses? 

00:33:10
CRAWFORD  Yes. 

00:33:15
ROBERT DILTS Which is also very interesting, which is somehow often times beliefs work because a belief is not about -- it's not a particular thought, it's a generalization. We usually say beliefs are generalizations. 

00:33:25
CRAWFORD Yep, got it. 

00:33:25
ROBERT DILTS So that's very important to know, yeah. Now the other thing that we like to do in NLP at this stage too is to really look at the positive intention of the belief and what we mean by that is this belief did not develop in order to stop you from success, it's developed obviously in order to protect you. So it's not like oh let -- and this is the strange thing. Well, let me get rid of that thought, get rid of that belief. Well, it's there to protect you. And I think it's really important to acknowledge that. And that's by the way why the belief bridge is going to need to accomplish the same positive intentions, right. So I need to have a different belief that will still, for example, protect me. But let's first find out for yourself because this is me speaking to really go into this feeling, the tension, you know the thought I'm going to die and find what is it, what is this trying to do positively for you. What is the thought? 

00:34:20
CRAWFORD It links to that other experience. 

00:34:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:34:25
CRAWFORD It's -- it did a really great job of protecting me -- 

00:34:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:34:25
CRAWFORD And it's -- it's typically gone into other areas of my life. 

00:34:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:34:35
CRAWFORD It's globalized. 

00:34:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:34:35
CRAWFORD It's very conscientious. 

00:34:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So that's actually really important to know that -- rather than feeling stuck and embarrassed about it, so actually there's a certain sense of being grateful, this actually is there to protect you. Now, obviously, what the challenge maybe that the way that it's doing it here is sort of -- 

00:34:55
CRAWFORD No. 

00:34:55
ROBERT DILTS We say, whenever there's a generalization, there's often distortion, deletion. And so we're acting in a way that's not actually the most appropriate for the intension. 

00:35:05
CRAWFORD It's no longer relevant. 

00:35:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, it's no longer relevant, yeah. So that's important to know. So notice all this is just by bringing awareness into the barrier. We're not trying to -- we're not trying to change the barrier, we're not trying to say it's wrong, we're not trying to get rid of it, what I'd like to say is that the most interesting thing that happens, once you bring awareness to the tiger is it becomes a pussy cat? You know so instead of having to shoot it, kill it, fight it, whatever, it's by the awareness it really -- actually this isn't a tiger, it's a pussy cat. So now that we know that, and let's give it a try. Let's now step back again. Okay. And let's move these things off from under your feet because I want to make sure you can really feel a good, solid connection, because here's what we want to make the belief bridge. And the idea of the belief bridge is that this belief is there, it served you, we're not going to ever try to get rid of it, we're not going to ever try to say that it's wrong. In NLP we say, the key is always to add choices, never to take them away. So now the idea would be to add another choice, another belief that what actually allow you to be to stay in this resourceful state, of course still be safe, but appropriately to the situation. So let's first take a moment and let's just really come back, don't -- we don't have to do any think yet, just really come back to that desired state, where you can really have that sense of -- you are talking about this type of -- you're not even think, you're focused on what you're doing, the awareness is on performing with elegance, with grace, being the best that you know that you can be. Now also we know that in front of you has been this barrier. And so here's the question, and as we think about the question, it's again not -- not so much to think analytically as just to sort of allow your whole being to sense this. What belief that if you did believe it now, if you could really believe it, even though this other thing has been there, I'm going to die, and even there's that memory and everything else is still the same, but it would allow you -- this new belief would allow you to be able to go into that same situation resourcefully anyway. So you would be able to do it anyway. 

00:37:30
CRAWFORD  Uhm, well, the only thing comes to mind is what I was saying before that, I am putting my focus on that -- that did its job, but it's obsolete now. 

00:37:45
ROBERT DILTS So what would you -- what would be the belief because and this is now important. What would I believe then, what I believe that -- so if it has done its job, what does that mean? Does that mean that you are a different person now? Does it mean you have other abilities. So what -- what is that, this is again the key part is to -- now we're going linguistically form, what would be this bridge? 

00:38:10
CRAWFORD  I don't know, I'm blank. 

00:38:15
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, well, take a moment. Yeah that's -- that by the way that's not uncommon. So what was it that to be a belief about yourself, about your capabilities? 

00:38:25
CRAWFORD  That I'm capable -- that I can -- that I am competent and capable? 

00:38:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. And you're confident and capable of -- am I a competent a horsewoman? 

00:38:40
CRAWFORD Yes. 

00:38:40
ROBERT DILTS And I -- what would be that? 

00:38:40
CRAWFORD I'm a competent -- I'm confident to do the job that I'm wanting to do. 

00:38:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, fabulous. 

00:38:50
CRAWFORD I've got the skills. 

00:38:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:38:50
CRAWFORD And yeah. 

00:38:55
ROBERT DILTS So by the way, did you hear what I was saying about I'm hopeless, helpless, worthless and that usually you're going to get, it's either I deserve it, I'm able to or it's possible. Well, in this case, we already know it's possible. So and the issue doesn't seem to be so much around, do I deserve it or not, it's more I am capable. So now, that's the words, that's the linguistic, but it's not the neuro completely yet. So what I want to -- ask you really to do Crawford is, if you really believe that, where would you -- and you wouldn't just believe it here, right, because it's your heart that's the one that was doing this before and so if you really knew that in your heart. 

00:39:30
CRAWFORD I think I'd feel it in here. 

00:39:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, yeah. So here's what we do. This is basically and what we mean by neuro linguistic programming is we're going to take that and go. It's -- I'm assuming that that's the truth that you can tell yourself and feel it there. I am confident, capable of doing what I set out to do, what I need to do. I am capable. And so really make sure that you do believe that that is also true. 

00:40:05
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:40:05
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. And notice, by the way, you can even see, I think, you can tell too, it's not just an idea, right, it's not just words now, it's like boom. Yeah. That's the neuro part of neuro linguistic, right. The linguistic is I'm capable, but neuro part is -- 

00:40:25
CRAWFORD Yep getting it at -- being free from it. 

00:40:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:40:25
CRAWFORD Yeah. 

00:40:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. On the one hand it's the sort of -- the other can be there, but this is the magic of awareness, I can know that's there, but I can choose which one am I going to put on. 

00:40:35
CRAWFORD Actually, even brought down to my feet. 

00:40:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:40
CRAWFORD The whole anchored. 

00:40:40
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:45
CRAWFORD On the horse. 

00:40:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, on the horse. Yeah. I see what you're saying. So -- okay, so now, we have that. Now, here's the whole thing, remember we said, we're never going to try to attack the other belief, we're not trying to get rid of it, it's there, it's been there, it served you. But you also have a choice for another belief that is equally true, that is also true for you and maybe more true now. And so what we'll just try it out here is to hold that belief now. And what we want to do is, maybe if we talk about inner game, outer game. Well, the outer game here is the same. It's there is the audience and you're performing, but all you're going to do and this is the whole interesting thing about this is you don't have to be thinking now what am I supposed to do, what am I have to remember. All you do is you just put your awareness into that place right there where you go, I am capable -- I have the -- I'm confident and capable to do what I need to do. That's all you got to do, all right. 

00:41:40
CRAWFORD Okay. 

00:41:40
ROBERT DILTS So, and kind of just hold that there and hold this sensation. What we sometimes like to do is what we call anchoring. And anchoring is the -- that there are two things. One is to have a sort of a -- do you've ever watched athletes, you'll see this that people go through a little kind of a -- a little ritual. They might have something that's a little behavior that they do. And that's -- we say that's anchoring, that's bringing me into the state I need to be in. So what would be -- either it maybe a gesture or posture or movement that you would really go, I am capable. Would it be, I mean, here you -- I see you are actually physically touching there, would that be enough or would it be to brief, to would be a -- 

00:42:30
CRAWFORD I think like doing a body scan -- 

00:42:30
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:42:30
CRAWFORD  Right from here to right down. 

00:42:35
ROBERT DILTS Yeah to there. 

00:42:35
CRAWFORD Yep. 

00:42:35
ROBERT DILTS So and so this maybe a kind of a thing that you do. I mean 

00:42:40
CRAWFORD Yes, true. 

00:42:40
ROBERT DILTS Literally, that you kind of -- you have this. You body scan before you go into the next time. 

00:42:45
CRAWFORD Yeah. 

00:42:45
ROBERT DILTS So that's your anchor we call it. Now, also especially since you -- as you were saying, you're pretty visual, we also like to usually use something visual, which in this case though would be like a symbol. What would be my symbol for this belief that I'm capable. Something that you could actually even visualize while you're doing the body scan and -- 

00:43:05
CRAWFORD I'm seeing a color. 

00:43:05
ROBERT DILTS A color? A particular color? 

00:43:05
CRAWFORD Blue. 

00:43:05
ROBERT DILTS Blue? Great. And I see that your eyes look focused in certain places that color at certain distance, does it have a certain shape or anything. 

00:43:15
CRAWFORD It's round. 

00:43:20
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So now, here's what we've been saying about this idea of neuro linguistic programming. Now, Crawford actually has the awareness and the choice to say which program do I want to engage, right? And we have it in all the senses I can see and I can say it, I can hear it, I can feel it. So now it really becomes a matter of choice, right? The reason for having the other thing that was to protect me, this protects me too. It's -- interestingly enough confidence is very often more safe than lack of confidence, right? You're actually more safe being confident than you are lacking it. 

00:43:55
CRAWFORD Well I fall off. 

00:43:55
ROBERT DILTS Yes. That's really good to know. 

00:44:00
CRAWFORD I actually do. 

00:44:00
ROBERT DILTS And this is kind of good to know that the part of you that's sort of afraid of that is going, oh, yeah, you know, actually, maybe this is the better -- this is the better choice. I'm going to increase my chance of survival by being confident. So, I mean, which is, I mean, truly is an important thing to know. But again, my point is that now you have the choice. So let's see, if you bring that and we'll kind of put yourself. Again, the best we can do right now, because obviously you have to go to the real situation. But we know that even just thinking about it before you -- you were saying like I can see it already. And we could even see it happening. So let's first try an imagination. You do your body scan. 

00:44:45
CRAWFORD I've already jumped. 

00:44:50
ROBERT DILTS Yeah, okay. Yeah. This looks a little different than before. Okay. You see, that's a different program. Same Crawford, same situation, what's the difference, it makes the difference. It's the program. Now again, the reason that often we get stuck in the old program is because there is a lack of awareness about where it is, what it is, what its intention is, and so we end up either just fighting it or being embarrassed about it or just being on autopilot. So -- 

00:45:20
CRAWFORD Yeah, it feels good. 

00:45:25
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. So, I see that. Thank you very much. 

00:45:25
CRAWFORD Thank you. 

00:45:25
ROBERT DILTS You're right to volunteer. Bravo. 

00:45:30
CRAWFORD Thank you. I don't normally, ever. 

00:45:35
ROBERT DILTS Good for you. Good for you. Thank you, Crawford. 

00:45:35
CRAWFORD Thank you. 

00:45:35
ROBERT DILTS You are welcome. So we're now -- we have a few minutes what I thought we'd probably do is just maybe summarize a little bit about the steps and then to see what questions you might have in our remaining time. So, as you see, this is kind of a -- a kind of a classic example of what we call neuro-linguistic programming, right. But we are not just doing as going, oh, it's a bad program, let's get rid of it, let's fight it et cetera. First we have to realize that everything is there for its positive intention. And the key is, we don't want to take away a choice, we actually want to add choice. The challenge of the starting state of this particular situation with Crawford is that it wasn't a choice. There wasn't a choice. In fact, I want to do something else, but this old thing keeps coming up. Now, without awareness of what this thing is, there is not even a possibility of choice. Now, by the way, I don't mean necessarily cognitive understanding, I just mean awareness, right, pure awareness. Just to give an example, there was -- when I first got started in NLP and we were looking -- we looked at all the senses; seeing, hearing, feeling, and especially in the realm of what we call this inner game, right, what am I seeing in my head and saying to myself and feeling not just outside, but inside. And remember talking to this guy who was really struggling with something, and I could see that he had this inner dialog going. So, I said, oh, are you talking to yourself a lot about that -- Jesus, am I talking to myself, am I talking to -- no, I am not talking at all. I said, well -- but I mean, do you have an inner voice, you ever, like, have conversation with yourself? Do I have a converse -- do I have a conversation, no, I don't do that. It's like if I ask you a question, do you repeat the question? Do I repeat your question? No, I don't do that. I mean, I am barely exaggerating, just a little bit. You know, it was like -- so what happened was this person had a part that experienced it, but no awareness of it, right. So, when that happens, it's your autopilot. And in fact, when I finally got him to be aware that that was an inner dialog, he said, oh, that's an inner dialog. So, I thought that was just reality, you know, that was -- it's my reality. So, what we find is that, again, this first idea of the belief barrier is I need to bring awareness to the barrier. That's different than bringing judgment, understanding, you know, anything else. It's just what is happening, what do I see, what do I hear, what do I feel, what is this program. Okay, now, of course, we start outside of it. We don't start in the barrier, we want to start from a place because we need to be able to also have a way to tell what changes, what's different. So, I will have my starting state, which as we were saying here, we call it the coach state -- C O A C H -- centered, open, aware, connected, holding, I am able to hold whatever that's here without it overwhelming me. Step into this situation, you have to reproduce it as fully as possible here and virtually be. Sometimes we can actually reenact it. Here you might use some kind of psychodrama or other things. But, what we then do is, we want to create the -- when I get the limiting belief, right, the tiger -- excuse me, it's not the tiger yet, it's just the experience created by the tiger, that's important actually. It's just what happens now and we want to do it though, not so that the person gets caught back in it and just feels helpless again. But he is aware of how I am feeling helpless, which is really quite a distinct state. I am not just caught back in it again. I am doing it and witnessing what I am doing at the same time. So now -- then I can come out of that, and go, okay that's all of me, that's -- those are the choices I have other ways of thinking, that's other ways of being. That's why we go to the desired state and we fill that in, what do I see, what do I hear, what do I feel. So now you have the, you know, what they used to call, you know, the $64,000 question, why I can't I do this there, you know. What's the difference that makes the difference? And usually it's not the environment because we can see in Crawford's case, the environment they can even practice in the same environment, so it's not the environment . It's not -- I mean, obviously the behavior is different, but it's not nothing where something is physically trapping me, stopping me outside of myself. It's probably something that's going on inside, and here is where we get to this notion of the belief. And the whole idea of finding the belief barrier is you start somatically, so -- because it's usually not cognitively conscious. And again, people kind of have all kinds of ideas about it. Sometimes I have people tell me all of their theories about what the belief is, and I find this actually something completely different than that. So, of course, I am going to always respectfully listen to their ideas or theories, but that may not be, I am not going to ever develop the expectation ahead of time that that's going to be it because you don't really know until you start to encounter where do I lose the desired state, at what point does that begin to shift. And where does it start to shift. I mean, thanks, by the way, it's really beautiful that Crawford was able to immediately tell, okay, it's up here in my shoulders. For some people, it's here, or it's here, or you see it in the face, or their eyes fixate, there are all kinds of things that will happen. Sometimes, of course, this is where the issue of awareness is important. Not everybody is practiced with awareness, and so, we'd go slow, you know. Sometimes that's the key time. It's just to spend that moment there. Where -- here it's -- here I have it, here it's starting to go, great, let's stop right there. Now, the next key is we are not thinking about it. You're not trying to analyze it or figure it out, you are just going, bring awareness right there. You bring your awareness to that part of your body, to that breath, you know. And then it's from the awareness there that something usually will come out. Now -- in Crawford's case it was very clearly these words, I am going to die. So, that's the linguistic part of the neuro-linguistic. The linguistic is not always verbal linguistic. Sometimes it's -- maybe it's a movie that runs or it's a -- and often eventually there maybe some kind of a memory, there is other things that are associated there. Now, depending upon what does come up, if there is something if a trauma arises that is still, you know, unresolved, we may then, pause, go work with that trauma, right. We're not going to necessarily just go right pass it. But very often, and I find this very commonly as in Crawford's case, it's not directly related to this and this doesn't serve me anymore. It is not necessary to have it anymore. I have other choices than that. So there is no reason to have to go and try to change it and -- there is a sense you know trauma related to this situation that needs to be dealt with. So, that's the one caveat I want to put here, in that moment, depending up on what that belief is connected to, I may want to go into some other intervention, but very frequently, surprisingly frequently, that's not necessary, you know. Either, okay, I can compartmentalize it, meaning, this -- yes, there is something I have to work with there, but it doesn't directly relate to this anyway, so I doesn't need to stop me from doing this. I can make, you know, an arrangement, and I can be sure that I'll go and deal with that. So, once we have that and we have our awareness there of see, hear, feel, what's going on, now we go back, oh, and of course, the positive intention because the key here is we call it neuro-linguistic programming, but actually we are not dealing with it really as if it's just a program, right. We are not dealing with it as if we are some -- little mechanical robot. We are saying that this is a program, we do have that aspect of ourselves, this is how we learn things, but the intention of it is something that is usually very deep. It's related to values, to deeper -- for deeper survival issues frequently. So, then -- so we're honoring it in that sense. But, as I said, what you usually find is that also by that time the thing, that is the tiger, has now become more of a pussy cat. Pussy cats still going to have their claws, of course. But, in fact I think it's interesting that Crawford was, when we were putting the new belief and it was here, because this is where they say is the seat of our enteric brain. The enteric brain is the brain around the intestines. And you know when a -- as a person grows, when the fetus starts going from the first division of the cell in the egg when the sperm fertilizes it, the first nerve cell doesn't appear for about 30 days, for about a month. Then the first nerve cell appears about a month into it and that breaks in half. And the one half becomes the center of the brain and the other half becomes the center of the belly. So, you've got a belly brain and a head brain. And this brain, they calculated, it has about something like 140, 145 million neurons. They calculated, it has roughly the intelligence of a cat, right, a brain of a cat. This is -- you know by neuro-mechanically you got that level of intelligence here. So, sometimes that's where the tiger lives. Anyway, what you wanted to do now is to go, okay, knowing that with greater awareness, so I am not just trying to push myself and make myself do something and force it and -- or compensate or whatever, now with full awareness, I can go, what would I need to believe that would allow me to stay resourceful anyway. And again, usually you're going to find, it's about something possible, it's I am capable, I deserve it, something like that. But now you got to move pass just the idea of it to really get the neuro of the linguistic, how would that feel, what does that look like, sound like, feel like, where in the body, what's the gesture, and again we usually like to have a symbol. Final thing is that, then I -- I simply hold my awareness there. I don't have to try and not think of something, this is always the other interesting thing. If I try to stop thinking of something --are we doing, we've got five minutes so if I try to stop doing something, that's what we call an, you know, an Ericksonian work, and in NLP, a negative embedded suggestion, because verbally I can say I don't want to fall and that makes sense. But how would I show in my body, how do I say, I don't want to fall, right this is what I don't want to do. You don't negate you can't negate, except verbally. So, this is where you get these kind of paradoxical things where you are seeing what you don't want to have happen and trying to avoid it, but somatically that's exactly what you are bringing in. So, these are, kind of, again, very interesting things. So, you are shifting the attention because when sometimes it's the most natural thing in the world, to put our intention on what we don't want to happen, right, I don't want to have this happen. But I learned this with my little kids. When they were little, very easily if your child is carrying their glass of milk and you say don't spill it, that's exactly what happens. But if you say, wow, you are really holding that so carefully, I am so proud of you, look at how still you can hold that, it works, right, because... don't do this, don't break, don't worry, you know, don't be anxious, that's exactly, again, the pits that kind of paradoxical programming. So, again, the whole idea here is, now we shift it, so our attention is all towards the -- and again it's not -- you are not lying to yourself, you are not making up a story, it is a truth, you are telling a truth, that is also true and that's where you are going to revisit that situation. And again, as very often, as happens with Crawford, it's like a piece of cake now, I got it, no problem, because I always had the capability, I have always had it. It's just what's that little bit that's been the barrier. And it's probably -- we have maybe time for one question or something. I don't know if anyone has one or are we -- yeah, great. So, the one question and then we will --

UNKNOWN Just to quick sort of putting that in the context of so many other things like as part of weird thing you were doing, I mean into personal neurobiology, when we talk about the mind is a flow of energy and information -- 

00:58:40
ROBERT DILTS Yes. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN And this was just a beautiful example of the way the energy and information flow can shift very rapidly -- 

00:58:45
ROBERT DILTS Exactly. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN From one mindset to another -- 

00:58:45
ROBERT DILTS Yeah. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN And, of course, as Rossi(ph) would say, of course -- and we have changed gene expression, and we've changed a whole bunch of other things. 

00:58:55
ROBERT DILTS Exactly. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN And so, it's the marriage and integration of all these things, but just a quick comment, it is just beautiful. 

00:59:00
ROBERT DILTS Thank you. And Yes. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, all. Thank you, Crawford.
