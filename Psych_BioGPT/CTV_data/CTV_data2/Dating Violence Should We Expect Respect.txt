STUART MUSZYNZKI Hi. I'm and joining me today on Principles is my co-host, Roger Sidoti, and Dahlia Harris, and we're talking about teen dating violence. Nearly 35 to 50% of teen girls have been involved, at some point, in an abusive relationship. Let's take a look at a scene that's all too familiar around the country. 

00:01:10
"Expect Respect" 

00:01:10
PHIL Hey. How much do you love me? 

00:01:10
JEN Phil, please. 

00:01:15
PHIL Not in the mood? 

00:01:15
JEN There's people around, okay? 

00:01:15
PHIL Yeah, so? 

00:01:15
JEN Gimme a break. 

00:01:20
PHIL Hey, it you don't want it, there's plenty of fish in the sea. 

00:01:20
JEN Right. Anyway, I bought some food for the party tonight. Taco chips, salsa, and a couple cases of pop. 

00:01:30
PHIL Pop? Come on. Don't bother. I'll take care of it. 

00:01:30
JEN Hello, I already bought it. 

00:01:30
PHIL Listen, if I'd wanted your help with the party, I'd asked. But I gotta go. Take care of this for me. 

00:01:40
JEN Yeah, right. 

00:01:40
Stuart Muszynski: Host, Founder of Project Love 

00:01:40
STUART MUSZYNSKI This is a scene from a play called Expect Respect, produced by Jewish Family Service Association. But I just wanna ask you guys, is this reality? Is this what goes on? 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:01:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, you know, how, how does it manifest itself? 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN I think it starts with the subtleties like when he came over and, it wasn't so subtle, like he grabbed her and everybody could see it. But, uhm, it goes farther than that and it may start with something small but then, like, she got angry with him as the scene was building on. Like, he didn't care about what she felt. He didn't care about that, he didn't care that she bought stuff for his party. All he wanted was to have that girlfriend and to make sure that everybody else knew that she was his girlfriend. 

00:02:20
PRINCIPLES 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN I think by, like, touching her was, like, his mark of, like, this is my territory, like, stay away. Don't mess with this. It's mine. Kind of a, like, uh, like he's in control of the situation. 

00:02:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, is it his territory? 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN No. 

00:02:35
JAZMIN A girl shouldn't have to be to feel , uhm, to feel controlled in a relationship. I mean, a relationship is equality between a man and a woman and the way he touched her like that, she felt really uncomfortable]. 

00:02:45
STUART MUSZYNSKI What else goes on? I mean this is, you know, touching, kind of a little verbal control, but, uh, what else happens in, in, and, uh, are we just talking in school or are we talking outside of school? 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN I think it definitely happens in both places, uhm, I mean, seen everyday in the hallways, but outside of school, it might even be worse because there aren't teachers around, you're in a more relaxed environment and anything can fly there. 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN Someone who is very controlling will, uh, keep the other from families, friends, and then there's this sense of isolation and, uhm, that can grow and become very excessive until it, the only person that one sees is the other in this relationship, which is very unhealthy. 

00:03:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI On the other, on the flipside of the coin, what would you like to see in a relationship? What, what kind of relationship is a normal relationship? And, and then maybe we can contrast what, what goes on in abusive relationships. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN I think it's where there's equal give, giving and equal giving and equal taking, you know, you don't see like one person control the rela-, relationship more than the other. It's just like, it's like it starts as a friendship and it just builds and like it it's not about, you know, who does what. It's just it, it, it's just normal and it's, it's, uhm, natural and it it's not too excessive. I mean, both people can go out with different groups of friends. It's, it's not, like, overkill. Like, I think when it's dangerous is when you see one person that's very isolated, uhm, that's not with their friends all the time and certain things like that are really big red flags in a relationship. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN I think it's also a respect issue, definitely. Uhm, the guy and the girl are both responsible to be respectful to the other one, uhm, whether it's understanding that a guy and a girl have different feelings, understanding that guys and girls like to do different things, like to see different people, and that since they aren't the same people, there can't be a control issue. It needs to be a respect. I can respect what you do if you can respect me. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Also, in terms of respect, I think that each party needs to have, uhm, a high self-esteem. You know, a feeling of self respect coming into the relationship because if that isn't present, then it's so much easier to fall into feeding off someone else and to fall into easily being controlled because you're more vulnerable to be manipulated if you don't have a strong sense of yourself and confidence in your ability. 

00:05:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI Has anybody here actually been involved in an abusive relationship? Anybody have any direct experience? 

00:05:30
JAZMIN Uhm, I met this guy. I guess he was the most perfect thing that I could ever imagine of and being at a new school atmosphere, it [00:05:40 was like everybody, all my friends were going their separate ways because they wanted to fit in somewhere and I didn't know where to go. But, so I began to become friends with him and then when we got together he decided that I shouldn't be able to have friends anymore. And I didn't really see it at the time. Now that the experience is over, I do realize that every hurtful word he told me, everything he would say to me, every time he would snap at me, it, I thought it was just what relationships were about. I mean, my parents' relationship, I can say was the same way, so I didn't know any better. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN And, Just like Jazmin, Abby did and she thought this guy was the guy of her dreams, and later on in the relationship, it turned out not to be and he started controlling her slowly but surely and towards the end of the relationship he had her wearing certain clothes, he had her talking a certain way, she couldn't have a certain amount of friends or certain a group of friends. But it, it was really sad. 

00:06:40
Dahlia Harris Jewish Family Services Association 

00:06:45
DAHLIA HARRIS One of the reasons that we started this Expect Respect program, uhm, in the schools is because I know when I was growing up when we thought of abuse, we thought of it as hitting. We didn't think of it as anything else. We, we didn't think of the verbal, you know, threats or saying bad things to each other or the emotional manipulation that goes on. Uhm, so, that's one of the aims that we have is to make sure that you know, you would know, even before you would get into that situation, what the warning signs are, uhm, and that's mainly the reason we started bringing the, the program into the schools. 

00:07:20
Roger Sidoti: co-host, High School Principal 

00:07:20
ROGER SIDOTI What some of those issues are, uhm, most of them are because of the inability of young people to form what I would call, uh, quality relationships and, uh, relationships that aren't steeped in powering over one another, controlling one another, and, I . . . you know there are a lot of elements that came out here, uh, the elements within the, uhm, the skit, uh, demonstrated that we have kids that are engaged sexually. You know, there's a physicalness, that whole, human sexuality piece, uhm, uh, listening to Jazmin talk a little bit about her parents and the role models that they have at home. Uh, I, I think that this is a real critical issue. I think it's one of the top issues that of, uh, emotional and, uh, physical health for young people today. Uh, the inability to, uhm, to balance the, uhm, society's focus, I guess, on human sexuality but the inability for us to really talk to young people about what does that mean? You know, what, what are the emotional commitments that you make to one another in a relationship? And, uh, and, and we don't know how to talk to young people about that. It used to be that, uhm, we were able to do that, I think, in our homes... 

00:08:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI By example. 

00:08:30
ROGER SIDOTI Right, by examples. But our homes have become somewhat fragmented and so now we've got to figure out a way of balancing that type of discussion against the, the, uhm, belief that young people aren't ready for that type of discussion because there seems to be a lot of different issues that are floating around. 

00:08:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI Let's look at another scene from Expect Respect. 

00:08:50
"Expect Respect" 

00:08:55
TED Chris, where ya been? We were supposed to meet like 15 minutes ago. 

00:08:55
CHRISTINE Oh, I went to the school newspaper meeting. Mrs. Katelyn likes my pictures. She wants me to shoot for the school newspaper. 

00:09:00
TED The school paper? 

00:09:05
CHRISTINE Yeah. I'd get to miss some classes covering away games. It's great. 

00:09:05
TED Couldn't you have told me about it? 

00:09:10
CHRISTINE The meeting wasn't announced. It just happened. 

00:09:10
TED Chris, you know I don't like to be kept waiting. 

00:09:15
CHRISTINE I know, I'm sorry. I went to the meeting, then I ran into Debbie and I lost track of time. 

00:09:20
TED Debbie? The new girl? 

00:09:20
CHRISTINE Yeah. 

00:09:20
TED Chris, you don't need a friend like that. 

00:09:20
CHRISTINE She's a talented writer in English class. I was just telling her about the newspaper. 

00:09:25
TED About the newspaper, you don't have time for it. When will we have time for us? 

00:09:30
CHRISTINE Well, we have time now. I mean, you hang out with Phil and the boys, but I don't even need to be there. 

00:09:35
TED I want you there. You're my girlfriend. 

00:09:40
CHRISTINE Yeah, but I could work the newspaper in. 

00:09:40
TED Look, I said no and that's what matters, all right? 

00:09:45
CHRISTINE M-kay. 

00:09:45
TED I mean, we don't need anymore distractions, do we? 

00:09:50
CHRISTINE Guess not. 

00:09:50
TED That's my girl. You know I love you. 

00:09:55
CHRISTINE I love you, too. I just wish sometimes we could... Could we do something together tonight? You know, skip the party. 

00:10:00
TED If the party sucks, we'll leave early. I mean, I gotta go. But make sure to wear that sexy, green sleeveless thing. 

00:10:05
CHRISTINE It's in the wash. 

00:10:10
TED So wash it. 

00:10:10
STUART MUSZYNSKI Let's take a look at things that happen to teens who are involved in abusive relationships. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN He pressures her for sex. He puts her down. He does not let her hang out with hi-, her friends. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN You can be hurt by words. You can be hurt by hands, feet, whatever is being used against you. And you can also be hurt by, you know, well, you don't love me. Stuff like that. It's basically messing with your head. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN She wasn't allowed to say a lot of things or wear certain items. She couldn't wear skirts, dresses. She, when she was around him, she was not to say anything at all. Uhm, he was very controlling. 

00:10:45
Stuart Muszynski: Host, Founder of Project Love 

00:10:50
STUART MUSZYNSKI What does happen when people are over-controlled? They're involved in a abusive relationship or a form of sexual control or powering down. What what, what happens in, in those kind of relationships? 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Rather than the people who are actually in the relationship, instead of them first realizing that [00:11:10that's what's going on, it's the other people around them who see their day-to-day contact, who see what goes on either in the hallways or out of school who notice it first, who can pick up on a comment that probably shouldn't have been said, can pick up on, like, a gesture or something and it's really sad that, uhm, the people in the relationship don't see it, don't wanna see it, don't respond to it. 

00:11:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, listen, Jazmin, I want to turn to you. What happened in your relationships? What, what happened to how your friends where reacting? 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN [They went from being this, this happy, going out person, let's go to the movies, let's, let's go to the park to I wanna stay inside, I, I don't wanna talk on the phone. And I mean, they would do - a straight A student, no, their grades started falling. They just kinda start keeping to themselves because they just stayed with that one person because they were being controlled. 

00:12:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI why did they feel so pressured? What, what was the power that... 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN I think she was confused with, like, love. She thought him controlling her was his way of saying I love you when it was not. It, she, in a way, she feared him, but, but it was, I don't even... 

00:12:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI And, and Jazmin, what about your own experience? 

00:12:20
JAZMIN Wow. 

00:12:20
STUART MUSZYNSKI I'm sure it's difficult to talk about. 

00:12:25
JAZMIN I think I began to slowly break down. Like, I wasn't as bouncy as I was when I came to school. I wouldn't talk to my friends as much and my friends would tell me, you know, he's being this way to you and, and you're just letting it slide by. And I'm like he's, he's not doing anything wrong. I mean, it's not like he's not, you know, physically hurting me. And I began to notice the signs later on. Like, he'd threaten to, like, break up with me because I said that this guy was cute as a statement. I'd be like "Oh, he was cute." And he'd be like, "You know what? You're so immature.". Uhm, and we'd get into fights about it all the time. And then, I'd be to the point of tears because he'd run me down and I'd be, and he'd be like "I'm really sorry. I love you" and I guess everything would be all right again, but it turned out it didn't. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN For Jazmin, like, she just got to this new school and she had no friends so like, this guy was like the best thing in the world to her and, I mean, you cant really blame her for that because it's, like, human nature to, like, clench onto the first thing that, you know, comes to you and that's, like, the slightest bit good. So like, uhm, I don't think that it's, I think it's wrong to say that people in the relationships should notice it first because they're lost in this ecstasy or whatever you want to call it that, you know, they love each other, or whatever, and they're confused with sexual feelings or whatever you want to call it. But that's what their friends are for and I know that's what I would do if I had a friend that was in that relationship. That's what they're there for, to be like, Okay. This isn't right 

00:14:00
Roger Sidoti: Co-host, High School Principal 

00:14:05
ROGER SIDOTIV A group of young people came to us and some counselors and principals at our school and said, you know, we're really concerned about, uh, this young lady and, uh, her relationship. And it was interesting when we, because she was getting, she was getting physically abused by, by her boyfriend. And it was interesting when we brought her in and sat her down and started talking with her. Initially she obviously denied the abuse, you know, initially felt that, uhm, that she wasn't being abused. But then as we kept talking, she admitted she was being abused. And here was the scary part, she said "Well, I really deserved it." And so, here we have young people who, who and especially the young lady who somehow this young man had convinced her that it was ok for him to beat up on her. Not only did she not see the physical abuse, but she actually believed in her heart of hearts that she deserved it because of the way she acted. I, I think that, that's just devastating to young people and, and I would agree that if it wasn't for her friends coming to us, that might've ended up in a terrible situation. And, uh . . . 

00:15:05
STUART MUSZYNSKI Let me ask a question. Where did this girl, or where, where does somebody who's in that pattern of behavior get the idea that they deserve it. Do they get it generally because that's the interaction that their parents have? Do they get it from seeing it in the media? Do they get it from something they saw on the internet? Uh, do they get it because they don't have the right other relationships, their other friendship relationships? Where do they get it from? 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN I think when you go into a relationship and your not, you're not confident in yourself, I think you depend upon like the other person for that for that reassuring, like, confidence. You know, like their, their love is what's gonna help you. It's gonna make you confident and, and able to be your one person, but it actually does the opposite. 

00:15:55

00:15:55
UNKNOWN I think its a compilation of different things, many of which you were saying, you know, obviously the self-esteem issue and yes, what the media portrays and, yes, depending on, you know, who is involved in the relationship. Absolutely, manipulation can play in. And abusive relationships, I mean, for the most part, in my experience and knowledge from them, it, it's not the type of thing where you wake up the next day and it's just this stark contrast from what it was yesterday and suddenly you're being manipulated and you're being, you know, possibly physically abused. It, it over time, it progressively becomes worse and worse and because you're spending so much time with this other person, it's so difficult to even notice it. 

00:16:35
ROGER SIDOTI But I think that when you look at the whole issue is you guys are talking. If you look at the whole issue, that esteem issue keeps coming up. And I think it really gets to the heart of self respect. I think sometimes we use the term esteem, self esteem and it's become almost a catch word in our society and it's lost its meaning. I think it, it boils down to that, that decent human respect for one's self and decent human respect for one another. And I think you've, you've hit the nail on the head when you said it's a matter of, of how do we, how do we have those conversations? You know, how do we, how, where, where do we start those conversations and, and I'm going to argue and Stu, you've heard me say this over and over again, I think it starts with adults. Because lack of decent human respect amongst adults I think is, has become paramount in especially our society and, and we need to start looking at ourselves before we castigate all of our teens. 

00:17:25
Stuart Muszynski: Host, Founder of Project Love 

00:17:25
STUART MUSZYNSKI First off, are we really talking about, uh, dating violence-type situation here or are we really talking in general that this is somebody who just doesn't know how to have healthy relationships? 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN It's more along the lines of somebody doesn't know how to have a healthy relationship. Because if people go into a relationship not knowing themselves or not loving themselves and someone else comes into a relationship knowing themselves and knowing what they want then they're able to overtake the other person. I think that it becomes an issue of they control, they end up controlling a lot of aspects of that person's life. And because that person doesn't know about themselves or maybe love themselves enough or respect themselves enough, that they take it as, like, he or she is caring about them and that they need to listen because in order to get the love that they want, they need to do whatever he or she says to do. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN All women really need to do is wake up everyday. They need to be independent. Like, TV and magazines don't tell women what they really need to be. They give them this ideal life that no female will ever find. Like, every female just needs to find what she wants out of life. Like, no female needs a man. No teenage girl especially needs a boyfriend, like in high school. You need to be focusing on grades. And like it can go the other way around. Like, no man needs a woman. Like, you just need to, you need to know what your goals are and set them. 

00:19:00
Dahlia Harris: Jewish Family Services Association 

00:19:00
DAHLIA HARRIS It's interesting that you say that though because the, when I talk to teens, the thing that I hear the most is, "But at least I have a boyfriend." You know, "Okay, so maybe he doesn't treat me that well, necessarily, but I have a boyfriend." And it still seems like you all can talk to it better than I can, but it seems like that's still, there's something to that, that there's this feeling that you need to be attached to someone, uhm, which actually can be really dangerous because if, if that's the thinking that you have then you may attach yourself to someone who may not be very healthy for you. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Like there's a lot of shows that have a lot of things that every woman would want a man to be, I mean a lot of movies, a lot of teen movies. You have a perfect guy and in the end they're together and it's happy but that's not how real life is and I think that girls, especially teenage girls especially, like, want something like that so bad after seeing it on the media that they will do anything to feel the way that these women feel in the movies. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, no matter how much self esteem you have or self respect you have, like, when you go into a relationship with someone, you're not really thinking about that, you're not really thinking about yourself, you're thinking about them. I mean, it's like, uhm, like you lose this sense of self because you're so, you're with this person all the time or even, even some of the time. I mean, and, like no matter how, like, much self esteem you have when you, like, fall in love with someone those barriers break down. I mean, that's the whole point of a relationship to, like, be connected on that other level. 

00:20:35
STUART MUSZYNSKI Would you get involved if you saw a friend suffering this way? Would you get involved? Would you be able to see the warning signs? 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN I would. I would jump into the relationship even though, I feel that it's my place because that's my friend and if she's being hurt, I'ma help her because that's just not right. That's not healthy for no one. And when that relationship was happening, I told her mother. Me and a couple other friends, we told her mother what was happening. And her mother was at first, she couldn't believe it cuz she thought, like, this guy, he's really good to her, but we, we told her the truth. We said that's not, that's not really how it is. He's hitting her. He's abusing her. And then the relationship did end. 

00:21:15
STUART MUSZYNSKI Well, what about the rest of you? 

00:21:20
To find out more about Project Love visit www.projectlove.org 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Something that we've all basically said is, it is the friends who see what happens first before the people involved in the relationship. So, it kind of gives us as outsiders to our friends' relationships kind of the responsibility that if something happens, we need to know who we can talk to. And I think one thing that ex-, Expect Respect does is that it provides you with an awareness that this stuff does happen and yes, it can't happen, it can't change overnight, but if people are aware and are educated on the issue, they will be the ones who will go into their friends' relationships and be like, "Hey, you might need to talk to the person you're in this relationship with." 

00:22:00
STUART MUSZYNSKI We're going to turn to another scene from Expect Respect. 

00:22:00

00:22:50
PHIL So, you're not happy? You don't like being with me? 

00:22:50
JEN Phil, we had great times, but then you just started flirting with other girls right in front of me and I just hit you and move on.

PHIL You've got quite a punch, too. 

00:23:00
JEN Phil, it hurt deep down every single time. And then I started to get upset at girls like they were to blame for being pretty. Just now I was blaming Debbie for the dumb things you said outside the washroom. I can't get upset at girls for being girls and I can't beat myself up because of you. It's crazy. 

00:23:15
PHIL Jen, I.. 

00:23:20
JEN And I can't let you do this to me anymore, Phil. 

00:23:20
PHIL Are you breaking up with me? Jen, do you want out? 

00:23:25
JEN I've never been in. 

00:23:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI How do we break the cycle? How do we heal an abusive relationship? How do people take charge? 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN The first step is to think of how to come out of it. How should you break away from this person? And after that you can start to work on yourself and reinventing yourself, making yourself over and building self respect for yourself. 

00:23:50
To order a videotape of PRINCIPLES: 1-866-517-1211 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Just because, after that initial break up, after losing something, like, that took over a predominant part of your life, you know, you're going to be, feel really empty. It's, it's just a really empty feeling. And, uhm, just making sure that there's people by you. You need alliances. You need, you know, for someone to call and cry to, you know, like . . . and definitely that, that process of building yourself back up and respecting yourself again takes a long time and when you think it's going to be easy and like, oh, I'm going to break up with this person and I'm going to be respectful to myself, it doesn't work like that. It takes time and that's so key. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Haven't been in an abusive relationship, but I've been in many relationships before and, like, the best thing for me is just talking about it over and over until I just get sick of it and then like a couple months later I'm like, wow, I'm over it. Like, just because I talked about it to people. When people didn't want to listen, I was just like I really need to talk. I really need to talk to people. It's the best thing for me right now. So, like communication just, anybody, anybody who will listen to you, just talk about your problems. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN When we go to the other schools and present Expect Respect, the first reaction is people laugh and I think that the laughing really comes from the sense of being uncomfortable. Like, it's not a topic that, uhm, you go out to dinner and, okay lets talk about abusive relationships. It's just, it's something that, uhm, in like a serious environment, it's a good conversation to have, but I don't think people realize how actually important it is. And so the laughing is just kind of an uncomfortable ph, what's going on? And then like through the play, it brings out a whole oh, this is really close to home. I see this happening everyday. Now it's my responsibility to do something about it. 

00:25:30
STUART MUSZYNSKI And now let's turn to Jazmin in her real life and hear what she has to say. 

00:25:35
PRINCIPLES 

00:25:35
JAZMIN People need to be loved and people need to be appreciated and if you're not feeling that you're going to find it anywhere that it comes along whether it's in, you know, the most perfect guy in the world and he turns out to be a complete monster, running you down and hurting you. Or you can find that perfect girl and she just thinks that she, that you can't do anything but she can and it hurts. And I don't think anyone should have to deal with that. You should have respect in yourself before you start looking for it in any other relationship because if you don't have respect for yourself, you're not going to find it in anyone else. 

00:26:20
JUSTIN BRENIS Dating violence and abuse are serious. What may seem like harmless teasing between guys and girls can lead to very serious situations in the future. The bottom line is: we all know how to give respect and should expect respect from our relationships. Thank you for joining us today.
