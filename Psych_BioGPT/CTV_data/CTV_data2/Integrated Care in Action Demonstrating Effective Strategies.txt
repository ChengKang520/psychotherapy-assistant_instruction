00:00:00
Dr. Russ Curtis Associate Professor of Counseling Western North Carolina University 

00:00:00
Erik Christian MAEL, LIC, NCC Integrated Care Specialist 

00:00:00
RUSS CURTIS Welcome. I'm Russ Curtis, Associate Professor of Counseling with Western North Carolina University. 

00:00:05
ERIK CHRISTIAN Hi, I'm Erik Christian, one of the editors of the book. 

00:00:05
DR. RUSS CURTIS The purpose of this video is to demonstrate some of the strategies and concepts we've talked about in the Integrated Care textbook. And by Integrated Care, we're talking about the collocation of behavioral health professionals with primary care physicians. As you many know, primary care is playing a large role in mental health treatments nowadays. And so the purpose of the textbook and this video, through the various vignettes, is to help increase a student's skill level in being able to work in an integrated care setting. 

00:00:40
ERIK CHRISTIAN The vignettes that we'll present today represent higher levels of collocation in a fully-integrated system where the providers share a biopsychosocial approach, share treatment plans and an ideology where they'll be working together for a shared patient care. 

00:00:55
DR. RUSS CURTIS And on a last note, we do have folks playing roles. We're not using real clients. So we've got behavioral health professionals playing the different roles throughout today. So, we hope you enjoy and learn a lot from this video. 

00:01:10
Part 1: Warm Hand-off 

00:01:10
Introduce yourself as Behavioral Health Provider (BHP) 

00:01:10
Make the patient aware of your purpose 

00:01:10
Discuss confidentiality 

00:01:10
Discuss billing issues 

00:01:10
Opportunity for the patient to clarify concerns in front of both providers. 

00:01:15
RUSS CURTIS The purpose of the Warm Hand-off is for the physician, the PCP, to introduce the behavioral health provider to the patient on the same day as the visit versus referring out to an outside agency. And it's important during the Warm Hand-off for the BHP to introduce him- or herself and make the patient aware of the purpose of him or her in the practice. And then, also it's important for the BHP to discuss confidentiality, to discuss billing issues, and, as you'll see in the following vignette, these issues are covered. 

00:01:55
(Eric is playing a physician for demonstration purposes) 

00:01:55
ERIK CHRISTIAN Heather, this is Russ. He's a behavioral health provider on our team. 

00:02:00
RUSS CURTIS Hi. Hey Heather. Nice to meet you. 

00:02:00
HEATHER Hey, Heather. Nice to meet you. 

00:02:00
ERIK CHRISTIAN He's the behavioral health provider I mentioned on our health team. 

00:02:00
HEATHER Mm-hmm. 

00:02:05
ERIK CHRISTIAN And so I thought it'd be important to bring him in and see if he might be able to help here. 

00:02:05
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:02:05
ERIK CHRISTIAN Heather's been mentioning some anxiety and some stress that really seem to stem from a recent injury. And from what she tells me, she's an avid runner and this has so has really kind of changed, you know, her whole week and day and the way that she functions. I'm thinking that there might be some things that the two of you can work on to address the sleep issues and the stress and the anxiety. We've seen some really good results with the work that Russ does. 

00:02:30
HEATHER That sounds great. 

00:02:30
DR. RUSS CURTIS What I'd like to do is spend about 20 minutes and we could do an assessment to complement what Dr. Christian has done so that we can collaborate to figure out what might be the best treatment. I will make you aware that that time will not be billable at this, but if you were to come back at later dates, if we offer groups or classes, or if you need to see me for an individual type meeting that possibly could be billable and we'll talk about it. 

00:02:55
HEATHER That's okay. 

00:02:55
DR. RUSS CURTIS And also in terms of ethics, anything that you discuss with me I would share with Dr. Christian unless you were to ask me not to. 

00:03:05
HEATHER Okay. 

00:03:05
DR. RUSS CURTIS So it'd be important after we talk that we kind of clarify what needs to be a part of your medical record and what, you know, we want to leave out. 

00:03:10
HEATHER Okay. Sounds great. I appreciate that. 

00:03:15
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. So as we just saw, Dr. Christian introduced me to the patient and I was able to meet the patient and hear everybody's point of view at that time. We also discussed confidentiality and billing right there in the session, and then just made sure that we were clear on collaborating for her treatment. 

00:03:35
Part 2: Brief Assessment 

00:03:35
Things to Consider: Emotions Thoughts Behaviors Physiology 

00:03:40
RUSS CURTIS What we're about to see in this next vignette is a brief assessment. And the goal of the brief assessment is to keep it functional so that we find out, and in this case with Heather the patient, what is it she's most disturbed by? What is causing her the most concern? And we want to make sure that we address that issue instead of going into deep psychological issues or so forth. We're keeping it very practical. One way that we can do this assessment and just kind of organize it for ourselves and for patients, is to consider what she's experiencing in terms of her emotions, her thoughts about herself, the behaviors, and also her physiology. So the purpose of this is just to kind of, so I can get to know you better, and find out more about how the injury and your symptoms are affecting you life. Feel free to stop me at any time if you become uncomfortable because I realize with anxiety, and so forth, talking with somebody that you don't know very well in kind of a sterile environment can kind of seem a little strange. So, but we'll go 20 minutes and I'm keeping my eye on the clock. But I did want to just gather some more information from you. 

00:04:50
HEATHER Okay. 

00:04:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS Dr. Christian mentioned the injury but I'm just curious about how you got injured and how else that's affecting you. 

00:05:00
HEATHER It wasn't some tragic injury, it was just this discomfort that just kept being more and more uncomfortable. It just sort of felt like rocks in my spine. 

00:05:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. So you're feeling it fairly frequently then? 

00:05:15
HEATHER Now I really, I don't run at all because every time I run it hurts. But it's still pretty much a chronic discomfort. I mean I can feel it now in my back sitting here or when I drive or when I'm on a plane or in a chair at work, or I wouldn't carry a heavy purse. So, and it's affected me because, I mean, running is what I've always done and it's been an outlet for me. It's a way to get out energy. It's a way to get out emotions. It helps me think through my problems. 

00:05:50
Acknowledging her concern and probing for information 

00:05:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS You know you mentioned that this was a pretty big part of your life and perhaps if you can tell me more about that, what it's like to go four months without it. 

00:06:00
HEATHER It's the one thing that I had that no matter what happened during the day, I knew I could go home and run and just the freedom that comes with that and . . . 

00:06:05
DR. RUSS CURTIS Yeah. 

00:06:05
HEATHER I felt strong. 

00:06:05
Reflecting content 

00:06:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS Yeah. It sounds like it's a huge loss. 

00:06:10
HEATHER It is. 

00:06:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS 'Cuz it really meant a great deal to you. 

00:06:10
HEATHER Maybe the one consistent thing in my life is running and, um, I don't have that anymore. 

00:06:20
DR. RUSS CURTIS I guess just the fear of, hey what's, what's next for me, then too? 

00:06:20
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:06:20
DR. RUSS CURTIS There's a part of that? 

00:06:20
HEATHER Yeah. Yes. I am afraid. I'm very, I'm afraid. When I look down the road and I think 10 years from now, what, where am I going to be? If I'm in this much discomfort now, and you know, it's just . . . What's going on with my body, and why is this happening? And how am I gonna cope? How am I gonna cope with it? 

00:06:45
DR. RUSS CURTIS So what we did in this last vignette with the brief assessment is we identified Heather's most pressing concern which were these back issues that were causing fear, some depression and how this was affecting her behaviors related to not being with friends as much and not being as active as she would like, and how this is causing her to have a lot of negative thoughts about herself and her future. 

00:07:10
Part 3: Motivational Interviewing 

00:07:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS So in the next video we're going to see how we can use motivational interviewing when working with a patient in integrated care. One of the first steps in motivational interviewing is to assess for readiness to find out if the client is ready to make changes. We're also going to want to listen for change words that we might be able to use and to cue upon when we're talking to clients to help maybe move them along the scale of readiness. And then, eventually, hopefully create our strategy based upon their level of readiness. 

00:07:40
Summarizing patient's concerns 

00:07:40
Assessing for readiness to change 

00:07:40
DR. RUSS CURTIS This has been very traumatic for you. For one, you've got this pain which is very uncomfortable, and you've lost something that was a big part of your life that helped cope. You're trying different types of things that maybe help a little bit but not a lot. You still feel the pain. You're still unable to run and it's been four months. We think about things on how ready folks are in order to make changes. If this was a ten point scale, zero being not at all ready to make changes and ten being really ready, where would you put yourself? 

00:08:15
HEATHER I'm, I mean, I'm, I'm ready. I would say, you know, I'm, I'm right up close to a ten. I'm ready to do something. I have to do something. 

00:08:25
DR. RUSS CURTIS And that's what I sense from you and I think that's, this is really going to work in our favor here. So, and first of all, just the fact that you're here. The fact that you want help, that you're also willing to look at what are the other things that I can do, other than say, just medicine, or just physical therapy but what else can I do to help find some things that, that can get you back on track. 

00:08:45
Preparation-Action Stage 

00:08:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS So as we saw in this last vignette with Health and motivational interviewing, it became pretty obvious that she was in the action state of change and so she's ready to make some changes. If we're working with a client who's in more pre-contemplative stage of change, we're going to be listening closely for change words. For instance, if it's somebody that smokes cigarettes and says, well I really enjoy smoking, it calms me down and makes me feel better but it is expensive. That listening to the change word would be that we're actually going to comment about the expenses. So we may say, tell me about the expense of smoking. So what we're hoping to do is help somebody move up that stage of change. Help them see, get motivated towards change. In Heather's case however, she's ready to make those changes and we can tailor treatment that will suit her stage of change. 

00:09:40
Part 4: Solution Focused Brief Therapy 

00:09:40
DR. RUSS CURTIS In the next vignette we'll be showing how solution focused, solution focused brief therapy techniques can be used in an integrated care setting. And a couple strategies that can be used is just making sure that we laude folks for coming in to get help. Making them aware that that was a brave step to come get help, and that they're actually already taking action in a positive direction. So it's important to do that step. Another really important step with solution focus is ask what they've tried in the past to help with their particular issue. Most people have tried something before they've come into a doctor's office and we want to make sure that we've covered those bases and that we don't duplicate something that they've tried. And then the next thing would be the possibility of co-creating a plan based on what they're wanting to do in their life. 

00:10:35
Ask about past coping strategies 

00:10:35
DR. RUSS CURTIS What other things have you tried to fill that void? 

00:10:40
HEATHER I've tried swimming and it doesn't give me the same thing that running did. And I still walk. 

00:10:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. Nice. Yeah. 

00:10:50
HEATHER And I stretch and do some little back exercises and um . . . 

00:10:55
Pointing out patient's strength 

00:10:55
DR. RUSS CURTIS I guess what I'm hearing you say is that you're not just sitting still, you're actually looking to find something. 

00:11:05
HEATHER Yes. Yes. 

00:11:05
DR. RUSS CURTIS And even if swimming doesn't seem like your cup of tea, you know, at this time, you're looking at other things too. 

00:11:10
HEATHER Yeah, definitely. 

00:11:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS And I think that's really going to play to our advantage. Have you ever experienced anything in your life similar to this in the past? 

00:11:20
HEATHER Maybe the only thing that I could really kind of compare it to is, you know, when my dog died and, you know, that was . . . And I know for different people, it's a dog, you know, but for me, it was a really big deal. But I was able, again, really to use running to sort of overcome that. That felt like a big loss to me and . . . 

00:11:45
DR. RUSS CURTIS What I would hope that you would keep in mind during this, 'cuz I am, is that you've got that spirit of hey, well I might not be able to run, but I've got this spirit of I'm going to find a way. And again, you wouldn't be here if that wasn't it. 

00:12:00
HEATHER Hmm. Thank you. 

00:12:00
DR. RUSS CURTIS Sounds like you've tried the shower. You've tried ibuprofen. This is affecting you in that it's making you fearful about . . . What am I going to do with my life? What am I going to use to cope? 

00:12:10
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:12:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS I've tried swimming, it hasn't worked. 

00:12:15
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:12:15
Miracle question 

00:12:15
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. Let's say that we're able to collaborate and work together and get you in shape. And let's say, let's go a year. A year from now things are working out really well for you. You're feeling good about yourself and you're feeling better about yourself with social relationships and all this type of thing. Tell me what kind of things you see yourself doing and maybe thoughts you'd be having about yourself. 

00:12:40
HEATHER I will be an active person, and, um, I'll be back to being a social person, and a person who entertains and, um, cooks and has friends over, and is a pleasant person to be around. And, an optimistic person, an energetic person who can get back to feeling really passionate about her work. 

00:13:05
DR. RUSS CURTIS Sometimes it can be helpful for folks, while we're working on treatment plans and looking at making you more comfortable, to go ahead and take a small step, something that you could do between now and next week. 

00:13:15
HEATHER Well, I, I went and spoke to a Yoga instructor at my gym. 

00:13:25
DR. RUSS CURTIS Yeah. 

00:13:25
HEATHER So I mean, I think I've sort of been putting it off but I think I could go actually on Sunday and go to Yoga class and just try it. 

00:13:35
DR. RUSS CURTIS So, willing to commit to that? 

00:13:35
HEATHER Yes. I'm willing to commit to Yoga on Sunday. 

00:13:40
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. Okay. I'm going to write it down. Heather is going on Sunday, and I'm going to check in with you next week . . . 

00:13:50
HEATHER Okay. 

00:13:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS . . . to find out how that went. 

00:13:55
HEATHER Okay. 

00:13:55
DR. RUSS CURTIS As we've seen in this vignette, Heather, again as we've talked about, is very ready to make changes and she was able to identify some of her goals and values once she gets to feeling better. And at that point, we can use these to start co-creating a treatment plan. Some of the behavioral strategies that will be used in concert with any type of medication or physical therapy. And Heather seemed to be amenable to that and it seems like we've got a treatment plan ready. 

00:14:30
Part 5: Positive Psychotherapy 

00:14:30
Suggested Strategies: Mindfulness Techniques Acceptance Techniques 

00:14:30
DR. RUSS CURTIS In the next vignette, we're going to show how we can use some positive psychotherapy strategies and techniques to help Heather reach her goals. And a part of positive psychotherapy is helping folks recognize that even if they are experiencing the stressing issues, they can still live their life according to their values and the goals that they have. So in essence what we're going to do is in some cases help folks create chapter two of their life at this point, if chapter one has not been very good. And what would that look like for them? Some of this can be strategies such as using mindfulness techniques and also using some acceptance techniques, to name just a few. Now it sounds like you really are ready to make some changes and um, sounds like you've kind of have the internal strength to make those changes even though it is really problematic with your experience and so forth. You've mentioned some things that you'd like to be doing, some things that sound like values to you. You would be involved with your friends more than you are now. 

00:15:30
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:15:30
DR. RUSS CURTIS Maybe cooking, cooking for friends, reading, doing things that you enjoy more. 

00:15:35
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:15:35
DR. RUSS CURTIS But the second thing is to maybe start building that mindfulness muscle. When you find your thoughts flitting off into those worst-case scenarios, using something. I'll use my breath. But using something that brings me back to, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, that's me flitting off. I just need to be present right here, in what I'm going to be doing right now. Thoughts are just thoughts and emotions can be good clues to what thoughts we're having, but that we don't have to become wrapped up in that thought. 

00:16:10
HEATHER Right. Yeah! 

00:16:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS It helps me to have kind of a touchstone that I keep in my pocket actually that reminds . . . Hey listen, don't get carried away and all that, and come back to your breath. 

00:16:20
HEATHER I can actually think of something I can use for that, you know, has emotional significance, sentimental significance, um, to kind of at least bring me back from . . . Because sometimes I do that where I start thinking down the road just, you know, just how am I going to handle this? How am I going to live with this? But something that can just kind of bring me back to the moment. 

00:16:45
DR. RUSS CURTIS And so it can help to have something as a reminder because it's going to be very natural for you to kind of flit off into the negativity or into the fear, or into the depression. So that's, it's just so common for that to happen. It's kind of how we are. 

00:17:00
HEATHER Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:17:00
Normalizing 

00:17:00
DR. RUSS CURTIS Having something that brings us back can be really helpful. Okay, so what we've seen in this vignette demonstrating positive psychotherapy with Heather, is that she really, um, has not been living up to her values and goals because of the pain that she was feeling. We established that, she became aware of that. And then we actually set some goals of how she can begin living again. And despite the pain that she's feeling, we can hopefully work together the physicians to help, that she can start making progress in her life and live in her life as she wants to. 

00:17:35
Part 6: Quality Assurance 

00:17:35
Seeking feedback to ensure quality care 

00:17:35
DR. RUSS CURTIS The purpose of quality assurance is to check in with the patient to ensure that she received what she needed in the treatment. And to make sure that we solicit feedback to ensure that we're doing the very best we can to provide good treatment. Research indicates this can decrease lawsuits filed and other research indicates that it can improve treatment efficacy. So making sure that we're getting feedback at the end of the clinic visit, it's a very brief thing to do and it can make a big impact. One last thing, just a couple of minutes before we go. We do like to do kind of quality assurance before we get finished. So kind of what I'm interested in is how this went for you today, how our interactions were. 'Cuz I want to make sure that we pay attention to our professional relationships so that doesn't get in the way of your treatment. 

00:18:30
HEATHER Yeah. 

00:18:30
DR. RUSS CURTIS And so I'm just curious about any feedback you have for me of things that I could do differently. 

00:18:35
HEATHER No. It's been very helpful and I felt very comfortable. I mean, it of course was sort of refreshing, but it has been very helpful for me. I really appreciate it. 

00:18:45
DR. RUSS CURTIS And it felt like it was a productive time? 

00:18:45
HEATHER Definitely. 

00:18:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS So I do want you, at any time, that it doesn't feel that way, or if you've got questions, let me know. 

00:18:50
HEATHER Okay. 

00:18:55
DR. RUSS CURTIS And the same would be said for your work with Dr. Christian, with any of the office staff, the front desk. 

00:19:00
HEATHER Great. Thank you. 

00:19:00
DR. RUSS CURTIS Yeah. Thank you. Okay. So as we've seen in this quality assurance vignette, Heather indicated that she was refreshingly surprised by the experience of being heard and that things went well. And that we made her aware that we want to make sure that she has the forum to give us feedback and that she feels comfortable doing so, so that we can be sure to give her the best care that we possibly can. 

00:19:25
Part 7: Pain Management 

00:19:25
Assess risks of substance abuse 

00:19:25
Educate about substance abuse 

00:19:25
Discuss the policy 

00:19:25
Discuss the program 

00:19:25
Patient signs an informed consent 

00:19:25
DR. RUSS CURTIS In this vignette, we're talking about pain management, and this can present some risks that we need to discuss. For instance, we want to be sure to assess for any type of risk of substance abuse or any type of family history of substance abuse. We also want to educate about substance abuse and about possible dependence that can be developed when taking certain pain medications. We want to talk about the policy of the practice to ensure that the patient understands what's needed if they take this medication. We want to talk about the program, which can be different classes that the person has to participate in and follow-up to ensure that they're using the medication as prescribed. And then getting an informed consent from the patient indicating that he or she understands all of the above. 

00:20:20
ERIK CHRISTIAN Phyllis, this is Russ Curtis. 

00:20:20
DR. RUSS CURTIS Hey! Russ Curtis 

00:20:20
PHYLLIS Hi. 

00:20:25
ERIK CHRISTIAN I wanted you to meet him today so that we could begin talking more about your pain management issues. Phyllis has tried a few different things to manage her pain but is still having some difficulties and still feels like she's not going to be able to manage her pain while at work. So I was explaining to her our pain management program and how patients who are receiving pain meds, which is what we're thinking of trying with Phyllis, also participate in our behavioral health programming. And so I'm wondering if you could tell her a little about that? 

00:20:50
Expressing empathy 

00:20:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS Oh, sure, sure. I'm a licensed professional counselor and I've been working with Dr. Christian in this practice for a while. And I am sorry that you're having to go through all this pain. I do want to find out more about you and what's caused it and uh, but I am, I guess I'm glad to hear that you've tried some things. That's a real positive note. What we will do is I want to sit down with you to find out more about you and I'll probably administer a couple of pencil and paper types of tests, just read some questions to you to kind of get a feel for if there's any type of risk of substance abuse. 'Cuz we don't want to get you into any type of trouble when you take some of these medications. So, and then go over those results with you and just make sure that we're all very clear on what the benefits could be and what the risks can be. One other thing is that if we prescribe the medication, or if Dr. Christian prescribes it, we do require people to, who get this medication to be a part of our pain management program. And it's a series of four classes and then there's some follow-up after that. But that is a part of it and it's part of our policy and it's just about teaching about how to best manage pain. We find that that works best. Medication and your strategies work best together than either alone. 

00:22:00
PHYLLIS You know, getting back to work right now, you know, that really needs to be my focus. And you know, I just don't know if I have the time to take a class too. 

00:22:10
Acknowledging patient's concern 

00:22:10
DR. RUSS CURTIS Yeah, and we definitely want to not interfere with your work. So what we'll look at something that can that we can adjust to your schedule and so forth. I guess the main thing I do want you to know is that the program does require the classes, so there may need to be a give and take, but we'll work as best we can and ensure that we're not interfering with that. 

00:22:30
PHYLLIS Well, anything to get some relief. 

00:22:30
ERIK CHRISTIAN AS PHYSICIAN Be okay if the two of you talked for a little bit about how we might get started? 

00:22:35
PHYLLIS Sure. 

00:22:35
ERIK CHRISTIAN And then I'll come back in. 

00:22:35
PHYLLIS Sure, yeah. Thank you. 

00:22:40
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. In this vignette we saw that we were assessing the patient to look for any type of risk for substance abuse and family history. We made her aware and we tried to address her reluctance to participate in a, in the program, but we made her aware that it was policy, and also that we would do everything that we could that it wouldn't interfere with work. She did eventually get to the point where she was willing to sign the informed consent and then that I would also monitor her pain levels and make sure the best that I can that she's taking the medication as prescribed. 

00:23:10
Part 8: Consultation 

00:23:10
(PCP) Primary Care Provider 

00:23:10
(BHP) Behavioral Health Provider 

00:23:10
Keep the meeting concise 

00:23:10
Avoid using jargon 

00:23:10
Summarize assessment and tentative plan 

00:23:10
Accept feedback 

00:23:10
Paraphrase to ensure understanding 

00:23:10
Document the meeting

DR. RUSS CURTIS In this vignette we'll demonstrate the PCP and BHP consultation. And a couple of things to keep in mind is that it needs to be concise, and that you don't want to use any jargon when talking about this. Everybody's pressed for time so you want to keep it brief. You essentially want to mention what your assessment, what you found in the assessment, and what the plan is. Ask for the physician's feedback. Be sure you paraphrase so it's understood and then document. 

00:23:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS Hey Dr. Christian, do you have a minute? 

00:23:50
ERIK CHRISTIAN Yes, I sure do. 

00:23:50
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay, two patients, the first one's Phyllis and the second one's Heather. 

00:23:55
ERIK CHRISTIAN Yes. 

00:23:55
Brief presentation of assessment and tentative plan 

00:23:55
DR. RUSS CURTIS Phyllis, related to the pain, I was able to sit down with her and talk to her and administer some assessments. Does not appear to be any risk of substance abuse risk. Also, there doesn't appear to be any family history of substance abuse. And she seems pretty motivated to make some changes. She warmed up to the idea of the program and attending the classes. And I told her that I'd work with her on that. 

00:24:20
ERIK CHRISTIAN That sounds great. Do you think she understands our policy and will sign the contract around the pain medication? 

00:24:25
DR. RUSS CURTIS Yeah, yeah. I had her kind of repeat it back and she seems aware. 

00:24:30
ERIK CHRISTIAN I think we can probably start her on some pain management medication and um, have you meet with her. If you see any adverse side effects or anything, let me know, but I'll be meeting with her in a month and I expect that she'll be involved with your programming between now and then. 

00:24:40
Paraphrasing 

00:24:45
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. I'll make sure that I'm monitoring and I'll be seeing her in these classes and then keep you abreast as to what's going on and her pain level and so forth. And so then, Heather. Heather with the back issues. She's motivated and she wants to make changes. She's not a big fan of medicines. 

00:25:00
Brief presentation of the assessment and treatment plan 

00:25:00
ERIK CHRISTIAN It sounded like she was willing to attend physical therapy, and I think that that'll be very helpful for her. But I am concerned about her feelings associated with the injury and also then attending physical therapy. She might need some extra support from you on that. 

00:25:15
Paraphrase to ensure understanding 

00:25:15
DR. RUSS CURTIS I will make sure that I get her linked up with a physical therapy and, um, that she's got me as a resource. And we'll continue to work on the behavioral strategies she's trying. 

00:25:25
ERIK CHRISTIAN Excellent. Sounds great. Thank you. 

00:25:25
DR. RUSS CURTIS Okay. Thanks! So what we saw in this vignette was demonstrating the consultation between the physician and the behavioral health provider. And we did this very quickly as you could see. We kept it very succinct and made sure that we talked about the facts of what the assessment were, the assessment was, and what the plan might be. We made sure that we were in an agreement with what needs to happen next. And then, we just want to make sure that we document that. Within the next ten years, we're going to see a lot more of integrated care, that more sites will be integrated. So we're very excited about this field and think that this is something that will benefit you. And we've enjoyed being able to put together this product that you can learn from. 

00:26:15
ERIK CHRISTIAN We're hoping that these vignettes illustrate some of the dynamics that happen in integrated care settings and that you're able to use these to generalize them to other conditions and other interactions that you might have with the providers in which you work with. 

00:26:25
DR. RUSS CURTIS And thanks for watching.
