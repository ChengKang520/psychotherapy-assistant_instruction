00:00:35
DR. LINDA GASK This video tape is aimed at all frontline health workers who come into contact with potentially suicidal people. This includes general practitioners and practice nurses, accident and emergency staff, prison staff, mental health and social service workers, probation workers and certain voluntary agency staff, particularly those working with drug and alcohol abuse. 

00:01:00
AIMS OF COURSE to develop a more positive attitude towards potential suicidal patients to increase confidence in dealing with suicidal patients to develop skills for the assessment of suicidal risk to improve technique in managing situations in which people are at risk of self harm Suicide is one of the major causes of death accounting for 1% of all deaths annually Suicide is rising in males in the 15-35 years of age group, especially those with drug and alcohol problems and in trouble with the police Unemployment has a complicated relationship to suicide with suicide being more common in those under threat of redundancy or who have recently lost their job than where there is an expectation of continued unemployment Suicide is more common in those who are socially isolated or who have no particular aims in life. It is also more common in those who have recently separated or bereaved 95% of suicide occur in people suffering from a mental disorder - most typically depression Alcohol and drugs are also implicated in both deliberate self-harm and completed suicide with at least half of all suicides being associated with drug or alcohol abuse MYTH! THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHO IS GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE 

00:01:00
DR. LINDA GASK The teaching package has the following aims. To develop a more positive attitude towards potentially suicidal patients, to increase confidence to develop skills for the assessment of suicide risk and to help improve your techniques in managing situations in which people are at risk of harming themselves. Suicide is one of the major causes of death accounting for one percent of all deaths annually. It's rising in young males in the 15-35 years age group, unemployment has a complicated relationship with suicide. Suicide is more common in those under threat of redundancy or who recently lost their job than where there is an expectation of continued unemployment. It's more common in those who are socially isolated who haven't no particular aims in life and also in those who've been recently separated or bereaved 95% of suicides occur in people suffering from a mental disorder, most typically depression, and alcohol and drugs are also implicated both in deliberate self-harm and in completed suicide. Contrary towards popularly believed only a minority of people commit suicide without any prior warning, most of being in contact with helping agencies shortly before the act, putting frontline health workers in a prime position to help prevent suicide. Research indicates that an awareness of risk factors and management strategies can significantly help to reduce the number of suicides. 

00:02:45
Assessment Crisis management Problem solving Crisis prevention 

00:02:50
DR. LINDA GASK This video tape is divided into four sections: assessment, crisis management, problem solving and crisis prevention. The professionals that you are going to see are played by real health workers, the patients are played by actors. We think it's important that you have opportunities to practice skills in between looking at each of these sections. This type isn't designed to be looked at all the way through in one sitting. In the booklet which accompanies the video tape there is a more detailed description of the skills. We also think that it's important, that you have an opportunity to discuss any personal experiences you have had in dealing with people who've been at risk of self-harm or who have committed suicide at the same time has practicing new managements skills. 

00:03:45
Assessment of Suicidal Patients General interview skills Clarify current problems Specific questioning about suicidal intent Background: past suicide attempts, difficulties, coping Symptoms of mental disorder 

00:03:50
DR. LINDA GASK Now let's look at the skills required in the assessment of patients who may be suicidal. We are going to look at general interviewing skills, the need to clarify current problems, specific questioning about suicidal intent, exploration of the background and enquiry about symptoms of mental disorder. There are a number of key general interviewing skills that are required in assessment. 

00:04:25
GENERAL INTERVIEWING SKILLS Establishing Rapport Questioning Style Pick up verbal cues Pick up non-verbal cues Demonstrate acceptance of the patient Clarify ambiguities Summarise 

00:04:30
DR. LINDA GASK We are going to be looking at how an assessment is carried out in three different settings, by general practitioner, a police sergeant in a police station and a community psychiatric nurse. You may look at all three of these or select the one which is most appropriate to you and your place of work, now lets look at a GP employing some of the general interviewing skills that we’ve discussed. The first consultation that we're going to look out involve a teacher, who has gone to see her GP to ask for sleeping tablets. 

00:05:10
BARRY What can I do for you? 

00:05:10
Um… alright. Well I've not been sleeping very well recently and…. 

00:05:15
BARRY Hmm… hmm… 

00:05:15
Ah… always up under some pressure work and I wondered if you give me something to help my sleep 

00:05:25
BARRY Hmm… 

00:05:25
It's only… I only need, I suppose about 10 days… 

00:05:30
BARRY Hmm… 

00:05:30
most probably 

00:05:30
BARRY Right. 

00:05:30
I don't want to… mostly for them. 

00:05:35
BARRY Hmm… can you tell me a little bit why? 

00:05:35
open question 

00:05:40
Well yes, And I told you that I'm a teacher and we've got an inspection coming up. 

00:05:45
BARRY Right 

00:05:45
And I've not been sleeping well. 

00:05:50
BARRY It's very stressful. 

00:05:50
yeah… yeah… 

00:05:50
BARRY Yeah… 

00:05:50
Yeah… 

00:05:50
empathic comment 

00:05:50
BARRY Have you got specific responsibility for it? 

00:05:55
Well I know that I am going to be little tired. 

00:06:00
BARRY Right. 

00:06:05
And I'm worried how it's gonna go… 

00:06:05
BARRY Hmm… 

00:06:05
…so it’s like constantly on my mind. 

00:06:10
BARRY Right, really constantly on your mind. Is it taking over? 

00:06:10
pick up verbal cue 

00:06:15
I suppose so yeah. 

00:06:15
BARRY Hmm… 

00:06:15
yeah. 

00:06:15
BARRY How long you felt like? 

00:06:20
Long time. 

00:06:25
BARRY How long? 

00:06:25
Months and months and month… 

00:06:25
BARRY Right. How long have you known about the inspection? 

00:06:30
Ah… last few, few weeks. 

00:06:35
BARRY So it sounds as though you are saying that you had something on your mind long before the inspection was coming on. 

00:06:40
Ah… the job yeah. 

00:06:45
BARRY Right 

00:06:45
Yeah… 

00:06:45
BARRY In what way? 

00:06:50
I don't think I am very good at any more. 

00:06:50
BARRY Hmm… hmm… 

00:06:55
And I'm having problems with other members of staff, I am particular that. 

00:07:05
DR. LINDA GASK Barry goes on to uncover a number of problems relating to work and home. She feels that she isn't coping with school and expresses some negative thoughts about how badly she's coping. She has also got problems in her relationships at home. 

00:07:20
BARRY What about you and your husband? 

00:07:25
We don’t spend much time together really now. 

00:07:25
clarify ambiguities 

00:07:30
BARRY You said now again, is this all something that's going on over the last few months or is it longer? 

00:07:35
Longer 

00:07:35
BARRY Hmm… how long do you think altogether? 

00:07:40
I don't know. That's why I just long time longer than I (inaudible ). 

00:07:48
summarise 

00:07:50
BARRY Right. So you'd problems at school. It sounds all things aren't wonderful at home as well. 

00:07:55
Hmm… no… no. 

00:07:55
MYTH! ASKING PEOPLE ABOUT SUICIDE WILL INCREASE THE RISK ASESSING SUICIDAL RISK 

00:08:00
DR. LINDA GASK Now lets move on to look at specific questions. There is no evidence to suggest that asking people about suicide will plant an idea in their mind which wasn't there before. Most people who've thought about suicide feel relived to talk about it. Most importantly you can't assess suicide without specifically asking about it. When determining suicide risk there are certain key factors that you need to consider, you need to explore the following: 

00:08:35
• Explore hopelessness • Wishes to be dead • Specific plans for suicide • Measures to prevent detection • Factors which make suicide more likely • Factors which make suicide less likely 

00:08:35
DR. LINDA GASK hopelessness, wishes to be dead, specific plans for suicide, measures to prevent detection, factors which might make suicide more likely and factors which might make suicide less likely. 

00:08:50
DR. LINDA GASK Lets rejoin the interview you've just watched to see how the general practitioner determines whether the teacher is at risk of suicide. He starts off by assessing hopelessness which is the single most important predictor of suicide. 

00:09:10
BARRY So how have you been feeling? 

00:09:15
Bit low. 

00:09:20
BARRY Desperate? 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
Yeah. 

00:09:30
BARRY Anything to look forward to. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:40
No. 

00:09:45
BARRY So you can't tell me how you feel or what things will be like in a few months time. 

00:09:55
Same as this. Worse. 

00:10:00
BARRY Hmm… 

00:10:05
It’s not getting any better. 

00:10:05
BARRY And is there anything in your life that lifts that feeling that alters it? 

00:10:15
No not any more. 

00:10:20
BARRY You implied that there was. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:30
I used to enjoy a lots of things. 

00:10:35
BARRY Do you want to tell me what? 

00:10:35
Well, I just enjoy going out. 

00:10:40
DR. LINDA GASK At this point the patient starts to talk about feeling low again, Watch how Barry picks up on this verbal cue and assess this suicide risk. 

00:10:55
BARRY How low is low? 

00:10:55
Really low. 

00:11:00
BARRY Desperate. 

00:11:05
[sil.] 

00:11:10
Yeah, yeah I am desperate. 

00:11:15
BARRY Hmm… It does not mean that you thought about harming yourself or killing yourself? 

00:11:20
thoughts of suicide 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:35
Yeah I thought about it. 

00:11:35
BARRY Have you? 

00:11:35
I don't think anybody would miss me. 

00:11:40
BARRY Hmm… How long have you been thinking about it? 

00:11:45
fleeting or persistent thoughts? 

00:11:50
Often on before bed. 

00:11:50
BARRY Does it frighten you? 

00:11:55
Sometimes. 

00:11:55
Specific plans for suicide 

00:12:00
BARRY You made any plans? 

00:12:05
Yeah. 

00:12:10
[sil.] 

00:12:15
BARRY Is planning about it how… Is it a detailed plan? 

00:12:20
I don't know if it’s detailed or not. 

00:12:25
BARRY Hmm… What were you thinking of doing? 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:35
Take some tablets, paracetamol. 

00:12:40
BARRY Hmm… hmm… Is how well the sleeping tablets came into it. 

00:12:45
[sil.] 

00:12:50
I wasn't sure how many, how many… Obviously I don't want to tell you really and I don't know how many. 

00:12:55
BARRY Yeah. 

00:13:00
And how many does it take to, to work. 

00:13:00
BARRY Hmm… difficult to say isn't it? It did you an awful lot of damage before they work, when were you going to do it? 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
Quite sooner this, if this inspection, doesn’t… maybe goes all the thinking will go. 

00:13:35
BARRY Hmm… so when is the inspection due? When are they arriving? 

00:13:35
End of the week. 

00:13:35
BARRY Right. Most of the inspection went okay? 

00:13:45
factors which make suicide less likely 

00:13:50
I don’t think it will. I expect I'll not do with them. 

00:13:55
BARRY Hmm… hmm… so you're really think this is going to be a major crisis, this inspection, now it push you over. 

00:14:05
I know that once they get, I've been doing (inaudible ) it’s the only way we can do it really. 

00:14:15
BARRY Does family know. Does you… is your husband do have high feeling. 

00:14:15
Oh god! No. No don't talk to him mainly about this stuff now but we used to he’s sick hearing my mourning. 

00:14:30
BARRY Hmm… so what was going to happen in this plan? How are you going to avoid him being involved? 

00:14:35
measures to prevent detection 

00:14:40
Oh he is, he's goes to work by doing you know climbing and (inaudible ) on this weekend 

00:14:50
BARRY Hmm… 

00:14:50
I miss him on various nights(ph). and particularly left there anyway. 

00:14:55
BARRY So you're spending quite a bit of time on your own and that will be an opportunity? 

00:15:00
Yeah no mismatch(ph). 

00:15:05
BARRY What's about your friends, people around you otherwise? 

00:15:10
Not too many. 

00:15:10
BARRY Oh they've… obviously your husband involved in lots of activities, have you got friends of our own that you're involve with and he is away around? 

00:15:20
No I got friends I'm not, I'm not seeing much of them. 

00:15:25
BARRY Hmm… 

00:15:25
SYMPTONS OF DEPRESSION •loss of interest or pleasure for at least 2 weeks + at least 3 of the following: •alterations in sleep pattern (decreased or increased sleep) •changes in appetite (increased or decreased) •little energy or motivation •restlessness, agitation, or feeling 'slowed-up' •guilt or worthlessness •thoughts of death Depressed people can have: •anxiety symptoms •delusions (fixed false beliefs, not amenable to reason) •hallucinations (false sensory experiences) •a history of mania (excessive cheerfulness) 

00:15:30
DR. LINDA GASK 95% of suicides occur in people suffering from mental disorder, most typically depression and it's important to try and distinguish depression from sadness, when people are depressed they experience a number of different symptoms which affect their functioning and ability to cope with every day life. The key symptoms they experience are loss of interest or pleasure, which should have gone on for at least two weeks plus at least three of the following: alterations in sleep pattern, Change in appetite, reduced energy or motivation, a feeling that they just don't have the same go, poor concentration, either being restless or agitated or the opposite feeling very slowed-up, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and thoughts of death which may be suicidal thoughts. It is important to say as well the depressed people can also have symptoms of anxiety and in severe depression people can become deluded and actually have belief of guilt or worthlessness and have [00:16:50hallucinations such as voices actually telling them to harm themselves. 

00:16:55
DR. LINDA GASK Now let’s look at a different interview set in the police station involving a young man with multiple social and interpersonal problems, who has just been arrested for fighting. We join the interview at the point where the police sergeant explores mood, depression and suicide risk. 

00:17:15
The police where actually quite concerned, help me out. I had full account on the table as the police are quite concerned that they thought that you're quite damned and you're quite depressed. What would you say about that? 

00:17:30
Yeah. Yes I'm. 

00:17:30
Hmm… How long you have been feeling that? 

00:17:40
Um… me and my girl friend have been like (inaudible ) a few weeks. 

00:17:42
uh… huh… 

00:17:45
this we’re rebuilding up. 

00:17:45
Umm… 

00:17:45
And I just enjoy quite a bit well. 

00:17:50
Hmm… 

00:17:50
She says I am too jealous. 

00:17:55
Really. 

00:17:55
Hmm… 

00:18:00
Why is that? 

00:18:00
I don't know that’s what she says. 

00:18:05
Uh… huh… What do you think you are? 

00:18:10
Maybe yeah. 

00:18:15
Hmm… it affected things between you two. 

00:18:20
Yeah. 

00:18:25
No way. 

00:18:30
It does causes all argument. 

00:18:35
You said things have began on over the, over a few weeks things have been gradually been building up and winding you up. Has there been any other way ways in which they've been affecting you? 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:55
No, because very often when people feel down or fed up, low, hassle stressed or whatever there is a number of things which… which keep coming back to them like bothering them. Any particular thoughts or problem to keep coming back to bother you? 

00:19:15
[sil.] 

00:19:20
Nothing you feel particularly worried about or guilty about or… 

00:19:25
No. 

00:19:25
explores worries 

00:19:25
Okay. Can I ask you a whole series of questions here okay? Some of them sound deft but just give them… you may(ph) you see more or less go to go through the whole thing for us okay, now what's your appetite been like? 

00:19:45
No different. 

00:19:45
You're sleeping okay? 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:55
Some nights. 

00:19:55
uh… huh… 

00:19:55
Or always. 

00:19:55
yeah. 

00:19:55
can't. 

00:20:00
Did you do anything to help you get to sleep? 

00:20:05
No. 

00:20:05
symptoms of depression 

00:20:05
You don't tend to drink a lot to get you to sleep or take any tablets to go to sleep? When you get to sleep can you stay asleep? 

00:20:20
I don't know, I'm quite lack of sleep any way. 

00:20:25
When was the last time you're seen enjoyed doing anything? 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:35
Can't remember. 

00:20:35
Really, not in… what you… what you do to relax once you are down? 

00:20:45
Watch TV. 

00:20:45
Hmm… anything else. Have you ever thought about harming yourself in anyway? 

00:20:55
explores suicidal ideation 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:10
People often do when they are feeling down, people often feel that hurting themselves, taking tablets, some people even contemplate killing themselves you have though about that? 

00:21:25
Yeah. 

00:21:25
Really. How long have you been thinking about it? 

00:21:30
asks about specific plans 

00:21:35
hmm… no longer. 

00:21:35
Hmm… and what's, what's brought that on to think. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:50
Its okay. 

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:00
Often if we talk about it okay and get answer, so sometimes easy to look at it, because when you have these feelings sometimes they don't seem that logical ,they don't seem that rational but they do tend to come to you. Have you actually thought about what you would do? 

00:22:20
Yeah 

00:22:20
How would you do then? 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:35
No probably like jump off a bridge or something. 

00:22:40
Oh gosh! Oh… oh… Have you done anything yeah to like being on bridges or come near them or anything like that? 

00:22:55
Yeah. 

00:22:55
Which bridge would you use? 

00:23:00
explores degree of risk 

00:23:10
Its okay. Things have obviously have reached at fairly all for stage for you, if you actually thinking about in this, What does you think about the future? How do you actually see things going for you? 

00:23:25
explores view of future 

00:23:25
No, I don't know. 

00:23:30
What is that? 

00:23:35
I don't know if it's of politic. 

00:23:40
Hmm… Nothing at all? What would make you more likely to harm yourself or to kill yourself? 

00:23:50
trigger factors 

00:23:55
If my girl friend don’t want me back that’s all, there is no point in living. 

00:24:05
Hmm… certainly won’t they. But if you got some help and support you think that would make you feel better would it. It's just that you're telling me is that things have got to such a bad stage that you can't see any way forward. You're 18 or so. 

00:24:30
DR. LINDA GASK Sometimes for example in case when enduring month loaners suicide risk may be ongoing. In the next episode Robbie who is a community psychiatric nurse, assesses a patient who is being referred to the mental health service by his general practitioner. Nigel is hearing voices telling him to kill himself. 

00:24:55
ROBBIE Did your GP asked you to come through and see me ah? You'd gone to him because you had headaches but he was obviously a bit worried about you. 

00:25:05
NIGEL Yeah 

00:25:05
ROBBIE And he asked me to come through. 

00:25:05
NIGEL Yeah… yeah 

00:25:05
ROBBIE What was happening? 

00:25:05
NIGEL Well, I've been having dreadful headaches just made me feel terrible really and you know I went to him to try and find if he could find some way of stopping it. 

00:25:25
ROBBIE What have you tried yourself before you came to your GP. 

00:25:25
Past coping attempts 

00:25:30
NIGEL Well I've tried taking tablets from the chemist paracetamol, some other just called co-codamol. 

00:25:45
ROBBIE I see you tried the usual things and they’ve haven’t worked. 

00:25:45
NIGEL They won't work. They won't. 

00:25:50
ROBBIE What happened when you saw the GP? He was obviously worried about you or thought of them as unusual… 

00:26:00
NIGEL Well… 

00:26:00
ROBBIE Which is why he asked me to see you. 

00:26:05
NIGEL Well that's I suppose is I told him that I thought the headaches were due to people… people that are after me. That cause him headaches and… he then kind of taught me a bit about the people who're after me and suggested I come and see you. 

00:26:35
ROBBIE Alright, alright who is after you? 

00:26:35
clarify current problems 

00:26:40
NIGEL I don’t know. Its secret service KGB, and the one of the… some are making headache I am sure it's, sure. 

00:26:55
ROBBIE I am not sure or really understand why the KGB be after you? 

00:27:00
NIGEL Well years ago ah… my brother and me we used to pass around and we discovered something that the KGB wanted and… 

00:27:15
ROBBIE found… 

00:27:20
NIGEL They still wants it, they're still after me for it. 

00:27:25
ROBBIE So something has been going on for quite a long time you know yeah. 

00:27:30
duration of problem 

00:27:30
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:27:35
DR. LINDA GASK Nigel explains that for about 15 years on and off he has been experiencing the sensation that people are following him and talking about him. He believes people watch him and signal to each other using their car horns. He goes on to describe hearing of voice. 

00:27:55
NIGEL And I hear, hear this man talking. 

00:28:05
ROBBIE Before, what did he said you know recently distinctly(ph). 

00:28:10
NIGEL It says things like we're gonna get you we gonna get what you've got, we want what you got if you don't we'll kill you and we're gonna kill you and recently it has got that we’re are going… you know we're gonna kill you if you're not giving us these things. 

00:28:35
ROBBIE As a part of the voice it seems to be getting worse recently. 

00:28:40
NIGEL Yeah he is now saying that he is just going to kill me, before they used to say we will get it off you. We will get that trigger off you. 

00:28:50
ROBBIE Right. That say is quite frightening(ph) and I am wondering how it makes you feel. 

00:28:55
demonstrates empathy & checks mood 

00:28:55
NIGEL It makes me feel terrible, I don't know the last couple of weeks there have been they have been saying well you know we are going to get you might well do yourself. we're going to get you. They're saying we going to hang you and you might as well hang yourself. 

00:29:20
explores severity of symptoms 

00:29:25
ROBBIE (inaudible ) to present. Did he say strongly enough to make you think that may be should carry that is it, is it that frightening? 

00:29:40
NIGEL Yeah… yeah it's that frightening. 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
NIGEL When I'm by myself it just happens all the time and even you know when I'm out sometimes I'll going down the road we can see don't… don't do it, give me some. 

00:30:10
ROBBIE So once if you're by yourself. 

00:30:10
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:30:10
ROBBIE It’s almost constant then. 

00:30:15
NIGEL Almost, yeah. I am trying watch TV(ph) and I just can’t concentrate, it happens then. 

00:30:25
ROBBIE Is there anything that gives you relief from it or you can distract yourself? 

00:30:30
factors which lesson symptoms 

00:30:35
NIGEL When I'm with friends, it’s not too bad then? 

00:30:40
ROBBIE So, what changes? 

00:30:45
NIGEL I don't hear the voices and, I still feel that people are watching me and I still hear pips and I think that that's then and but I don’t hear the voices so much. I suppose it's… I don't know, I don't know why but when some is talking to me and I'm you know during conversation I just don't hear the voices. 

00:31:10
ROBBIE Hmm… hmm… some company makes it better. 

00:31:15
NIGEL Yeah company makes it better. 

00:31:20
ROBBIE What I am still not very sure about is what distresses you most, the voices saying the bad things or the belief that you, you may have to act yourself that you may have to carry it out? 

00:31:35
NIGEL Yeah, I feel at times when it gets really bad I feel I should go and do it and then that'll shoot them open after do it listen to it any more. 

00:31:50
ROBBIE Has it ever gone to the stage where you thought, I must go and do like that, I can’t take anymore as that happened. 

00:32:00
NIGEL I've, I've got a rope. I’ve kind of been thinking, right, where shall I put it, shall tie it when I’m in a room by myself. I am thinking of tie it around the curtain rail do it there but then I think no, that's not going to hold me. 

00:32:25
specific plans 

00:32:25
ROBBIE So, you began to have some kind of plan? Is that bit of fear that ever manages to fight against that. 

00:32:40
NIGEL Yeah, know, now again I am trying to think of some day I am not doing what he said and that you know you've been only 15 years and you have gone through it that long and I'm not going to listen to you, but only get so bad sometimes, I can’t sleep, I think it's a combination of them saying go and you might as kill, kill yourself go and do it now and not being able to sleep and wanting to get rid of it. 

00:33:15
ROBBIE Are you more at risk at need when you’re on your own then? 

00:33:15
factors which increase risk 

00:33:20
NIGEL Yeah… yeah. Definitely, it’s definitely worse at night. That is non one around then I am in a flat you know and you can't kind of bang on your friends doors it's 3 o'clock in the morning. 

00:33:35
degree of planning 

00:33:40
ROBBIE When you thought about harming yourself has it been an impose of thing, I’ve got to go and do this because I am really upset or has it been more of a planned thing? This would be a good thing, this would be a good place. 

00:34:00
NIGEL I really thought it’s just it build up and built out throughout the night and it gets worse and worse and I have got a rope. But it’s going to… because I can’t stand it any longer and I am frightened that I am going to do it one day and so arrived today while I was here I don't want to do it the night when it's happening. 

00:34:40
DR. LINDA GASK It transpires that Nigel has been in contact with the services before. Robbie goes on to assess whether Nigel has made any previous suicide attempts. 

00:34:50
ROBBIE Can I just you Nigel, you mentioned that this has been going for a long time and there's the episode with rope… 

00:35:00
NIGEAL Yeah. 

00:35:00
ROBBIE …where you thought about hanging yourself. Have you ever done anything in the past when things have been that desperate? 

00:35:05
previous attempts 

00:35:10
NIGEL Yeah. Took an overdose before when that’s before I went into hospital 

00:35:25
ROBBIE What happened then? 

00:35:30
NIGEL Well there were, people who were following me. I think it just got so unbearable so that people who were watching me all the time and police were saying, we'll get you out of secret, will get it off you I can’t stand it so I had some anti-depressant from GP and I took them all. 

00:36:05
ROBBIE And that point again who is it something that you did on impulse or had to plan to take them on certain time. 

00:36:10
MYTH! PEOPLE WHO SELF HARM ARE JUST ATTENTION SEEKING AND ARE NOT AT RISK 

00:36:15
DR. LINDA GASK Some people use self-harm as a coping strategy with no plans to actually kill themselves. However the risk of suicide following a suicide attempt is a hundred times that of the general population, so you should be aware of the factors associated with suicide after an incident of deliberate self-harm. The factors associated with suicide risk after self-harm or attempted suicide are as follows. 

00:36:40
FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SUICIDE RISK AFTER SELF-HARM OR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE •male sex •social isolation •no meaningful role in life •recent separation, divorce, bereavement •living alone •poor physical health •history of violence to others •history of violent self harm •alcohol/drug misuse •current psychiatric disorder 

00:37:00
DR. LINDA GASK He should be particularly vary of the high suicide risk in people who make a number of suicide attempts with increasing frequency and increasing seriousness. Find out about the antecedents of the attempt. Explore the attempt itself and make sure that you try and assess the person’s mental state. 

00:37:30
Antecedents •duration and degree of planning of suicide attempt •detailed account of events in preceding 48 hours •final acts (suicide note, will etc.) The Attempt •lethality •expectation of outcome •precautions against discovery Mental state •mood (especially hopelessness/ worthlessness) •suicidal thoughts •current attitude (regret or guilt concerning the recent suicide attempt is less likely to be associated with completed suicide) 

00:37:35
DR. LINDA GASK Pause the type after this and every section of this video tape and practice asking about suicidal risks and the symptoms of major depression. Remember to try and use the general interviewing skills that we described earlier. The next section of this video tape goes on to examine the concept of crisis management. This automatically follows on from assessment and the two may take place together. 

00:38:05
AIMS OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT •To calm the patient down •to reduce the immediate risk of suicide •to enhance hope and confidence •to improve effectiveness in tackling problems •to arrange treatment of mental disorder 

00:38:05
DR. LINDA GASK The Aims of crisis management are to calm the patient down and to reduce the immediate risk of suicide, to try and enhance hope and confidence and improve effectiveness in tackling problems and to arrange treatments of mental disorder. There are some particular techniques, some of which will demonstrate to you in the forthcoming sections. 

00:38:35
TECHNIQUES OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT •Allowing emotions to be released •Taking charge of the interview •Addressing immediate problems •Providing immediate support •Bolster self-esteem •Improving Hopefulness •Attempt to ensure safety •Use of family, friends and other professionals 

00:38:45
DR. LINDA GASK Let’s go on to look at some of these in the next few interviews. First lets look at the interview you saw earlier with general practitioner Barry and the teacher, Its Friday afternoon and the school inspection went as bad as had expected. The weekends already been identified as a crucial time furthermore the teacher is convinced that her husband won't cancel his weekend trip. Watch how Barry tries to ensure his patience safety.

00:41:10

00:41:15

[sil.] 

00:44:15
SORALIA She doesn't (inaudible ), she doesn't (inaudible ). 

00:44:22
BARRY Uh…Huh… Good person to have around? 

00:44:25
SORALIA I’ve not seen her for ages. 

00:44:30
BARRY Hmm… 

00:44:30
SORALIA Just occasionally talk to her. 

00:44:30
BARRY Alright. May be she hasn't seen, I shall not seen him for a while either? 

00:44:40

00:45:10
BARRY (inaudible ) being seriously ill? 

00:45:20

SORALIA He’d prefer to be seriously ill. 

00:45:30
BARRY Uh…Huh… 

00:45:30
SORALIA This is worse. 

00:45:35
BARRY Because someone can do something about it when you’re seriously ill or you can try. The thing what I’m saying is that we can try and do something about this? 

00:45:45
improves hopefulness 

00:45:50
BARRY And the first thing we can try is to have someone with you that you can rely on, that you can trust, that you want to be with. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:05
BARRY May be just get rid of the tablets that you were planning to kill yourself with? 

00:46:10
removal of lethal means 

00:46:15
BARRY It’s not there, available. Did you bring them with you? 

00:46:25
SORALIA Yeah. 

00:46:30
BARRY Can I make a suggestion? 

00:46:30
providing immediate support

00:46:50
SORALIA About 7:00. 

00:46:50
BARRY Okay, then I’ll try to be there before that, and tell him I'm coming. 

00:46:55
DR. LINDA GASK In a crisis, it may be necessary to take control of the situation, in order to ensure that the person gets appropriate care. In the next scenario, watch our casualty sister takes control and employs distraction in order to ensure that a patient stays in the department to see the duty psychiatrist. 

00:47:15
Maybe you not sir, happy about waiting? 

00:47:20
No, no. I’ve been an hour now. 

00:47:20
I know you have. Really sorry about that. The physiatrist has been upon the ward seeing a patient, but I’ve just spoken to him. 

00:47:30
(crosstalk)(inaudible) the physiatrist? 

00:47:30
Well the physiatrist is just here to have a chat with you. 

00:47:35
I’m not daft. 

00:47:35
I’m not saying that you are, but he’s here to have a chat with you and see if he can help you. 

00:47:40
I won’t… I don’t… I don’t wanna see a physiatrist. I don’t… I don’t… I thought you could help me… I don’t wanna see a physiatrist. 

00:47:45
What you’re frightened of? 

00:47:45
clarification 

00:47:45
I just… (inaudible ). 

00:47:50
No! 

00:47:50
Straight jackets and… 

00:47:50
The physiatrist is just a doctor. He’s here to have a chat with you about your problems. Like I have to (inaudible ), like the casualty doctor has done. You can’t be slaw. 

00:48:05
Well, I don’t… I don’t he’d be any good to me at all, (inaudible ), stupid command in the first place I think. 

00:48:15
You’ve made it this far. You’re obviously very frightened about what happened before. 

00:48:20
emphatic comment 

00:48:20
Yeah! 

00:48:20
To bring you to casualty. You can wait a little bit longer. 

00:48:25
(inaudible ) he got a staff. 

00:48:30
It is you’ve come this far, you’ve been positive, you’ve come to casualty today. Do you want to tell me a bit about your daughter? What’s her name? 

00:48:40
It’s Cola Reece. 

00:48:40
Reece! You seem very proud of her? What’s the university? 

00:48:45
Yeah, she (inaudible ), you know she’s. 

00:48:50
How old is she? 

00:48:50
She’s 20. 

00:48:55
Which university that she went to? 

00:48:55
(inaudible ). 

00:49:00
And what she’s studying? 

00:49:00
She’s doing English lit. 

00:49:00
Does she graduate soon? 

00:49:05
Actually she’s only in the first year and you know so I don’t wanna ‘em either. I don’t wanna you know (inaudible ) to be proud of you know. 

00:49:17
Sure she would. 

00:49:17
Yeah. 

00:49:20
DR. LINDA GASK Now let’s go back to the scenario involving Nigel, the man who’s experiencing psychotic symptoms. Having identified a suicide risk, Robbie tries to ensure his client’s safety. 

00:49:35
ROBBIE If I can just summarize a bit. 

00:49:40
summarises 

00:49:40
ROBBIE You… You’re distressed by all of this? 

00:49:40
NIGEL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:49:45
ROBBIE Some things driven to do something, something has driven to think about hanging yourself, because you get so bad? 

00:49:50
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:49:50
ROBBIE Yeah. But, there’s a small bit of you that can still fight against it, because it’s been going on for so long? 

00:50:00
NIGEL Yeah! I don't want to kill myself, with a knife. 

00:50:05
ROBBIE Right. 

00:50:05
NIGEL Like say I’ve tried putting the rope and so, now that way I will be and I suppose that it did lie in that kind of thing that stopped me doing, you know… 

00:50:15
ROBBIE Hmm… 

00:50:15
NIGEL …sort of about perhaps I need to go out and find the trails or something thing like that. 

00:50:25
ROBBIE Alright. I am wondering if you could go in other way and think about how you might make the situation safer? 

00:50:30
NIGEL Hmm…. 

00:50:30
ROBBIE And look at it actually, and make it more (inaudible ) and be, take away some… some of the immediate risks for you. Yeah, I am… I guess the first thing is it would be helpful to get rid of the rope. 

00:50:50
removal of lethal means 

00:50:50
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:50:50
ROBBIE Yeah. 

00:50:55
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:50:55
ROBBIE And beyond that, I think we need to look at all our things, it seems like… it seems like the thought you are having (inaudible ) respond to medication on you. 

00:51:05
improves hopefulness 

00:51:05
ROBBIE May be your GP can look at something else that could give you some relief. 

00:51:10
NIGEL Hmm… 

00:51:10
ROBBIE It seems like that, more (inaudible ) things there in a bit but. 

00:51:15
NIGEL It does going to take umm… day after day after day. 

00:51:20
ROBBIE Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:20
NIGEL Who has been… 

00:51:20
ROBBIE Well because of the strain full things. 

00:51:20
NIGEL (crosstalk)(inaudible) think better. 

00:51:25
ROBBIE Yeah, sure, sure. So it’s a short term, we can look at things like getting little hope, yeah. 

00:51:30
NIGEL Hmm… 

00:51:35
ROBBIE So we can go and glue with that or while this is, this finishes really going to relieve you. Uh…Huh… 

00:51:40
ensures immediate safety 

00:51:40
NIGEL But you’ve come in. 

00:51:40
ROBBIE Well, that would come home with you, that’s okay and nicely take it away I think, yeah. 

00:51:45
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:51:45
ROBBIE Yeah. 

00:51:45
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:51:50
ROBBIE We would help… It would be helpful, I think if we, to own our things to distract you, you know all those people who could is like fooling they until medication kicks in. Are there friends, have you got family, are there supports around? 

00:52:05
use of support network 

00:52:05
NIGEL I’ve got, there’s my brother, he lives, although I don’t, well he’s got a family, yeah, there’s my brother and a couple of friends. 

00:52:20
ROBBIE And again I think, I’m talking very much about short term crisis here, so it will be reasonable to expect your partner to support you through phone calls week after week, but over the next few days, can we get a plan, that we can support you there? 

00:52:35
NIGEL Uh… 

00:52:35
ROBBIE And who could we use, is that your brother, some friends? 

00:52:40
NIGEL I got a good friend. 

00:52:40
ROBBIE Alright. 

00:52:45
NIGEL Though I have a friend named Afelius(ph). It’s a big commitment for him, which is not very… Yeah! I suppose on short term. Uh… 

00:53:00
ROBBIE I'm… I’m… 

00:53:05
NIGEL I think you feel better when I’m talking some… 

00:53:10
ROBBIE Alright. That's the thing that comes through them, like if you have company or if you are engaged somehow? 

00:53:15
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:53:15
ROBBIE That you’re more of a likes them. 

00:53:15
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:53:20
ROBBIE And then longer term. 

00:53:20
NIGEL It is almost like they protect me in someway. They’ve always, won’t say anything like someone else is around, in case I… I… 

00:53:35
[sil.] 

00:53:40
ROBBIE Longer term perhaps, look at things like more suitable medication that you can totally okay. 

00:53:50
NIGEL Yeah, if I don't, felt dreadful when I was taken it before. 

00:53:55
ROBBIE Uh… Are you happy enough that just now we come in to gonna order your GP and you just know what’s happening. 

00:54:05
NIGEL Yeah. 

00:54:10
USE OF APPROPRIATE SUPPORT - Family and friends can offer better support than professionals if they are available and empathic - It is important to clarify with the patient who is going to be the most effective kind of support and who is best able to provide it - Teenagers and immature people become distressed by being with suicidal patients and should not be relied upon - Parents may be too overprotective / judgmental and therefore not the best source of support - It is important that friends and families of suicidal people are informed of risks and what to do if the situation gets worse 

00:54:10
DR. LINDA GASK Family and friends can offer better support than professionals if they are available and empathic. It is important to clarify with the patient who is going to be the most effective kind of support and who is best able to provide it. Teenagers and immature people become distressed by being with suicidal patients, and parents may be too overprotective or judgmental. It’s important that friends and family are informed of the risks and what to do if the situation actually gets worse. This next interview involves Don, a drugs counselor and Julian, a heroin user, who is recently being sacked from her job for stealing. She has having serious problems with her boyfriend, who is also a drug user, and is now expressing the view that life isn't worth going on with. What shall Don assess as appropriate support? 

00:55:05
DON Before we go any further, I’m… I know that you say there are very people in your life that you can rely on or confide in. 

00:55:15
JULIAN Hmm… 

00:55:15
DON But I think it is very important that you find somebody that can offer you support through this? 

00:55:20
JULIAN Hmm… No, I’ve got mates really. I just don't know how, you know how to rely… not reliable but, you know how to be about it. I don't know. 

00:55:35
DON What about the family? 

00:55:40
[sil.] 

00:55:45
explores available support 

00:55:45
JULIAN Hmm… No, they normally hit the roof I think. 

00:55:50
DON True. 

00:55:50
JULIAN He doesn't know. Do you know what I mean? 

00:55:55
[sil.] 

00:56:00
DON Sorry, I think you should call, she’ll go wild if you, if you tell him that. 

00:56:05
JULIAN Well, he’ll come around and stop, cleaning up and telling what to do and stuff. I mean, I'll try in the afternoon. I’ve got a couple of mates who might… What you mean help me anyway? 

00:56:25
DON Umm… I think at the moment you are feeling quite depressed, and that depression isn't going to go away just because you’re in a Detox. I think you’re going to feel at times that you need somebody around for just to say how you feel, somebody would be there to lookout for you, when you’re not feeling very good. 

00:56:45
JULIAN Hmm… 

00:56:45
DON And I think there will be times, when you want to go get heroin as well. And it’s useful. And I think it’s useful to have somebody around who can, who can help you do with those things. 

00:57:05
JULIAN Hmm… 

00:57:05
DON You see, you’ve got couple of mates. Umm… Tell me a little bit about them? 

00:57:10
JULIAN Well, there is Alison at work, well indeed working. And I’ve got couple of mates that I still, I still see. I know people who take (inaudible ). 

00:57:37
DON No, I don’t think so. 

00:57:37
JULIAN But you know, umm… 

00:57:40
DON Tell me about Alison? Why would she be a good person? 

00:57:45
JULIAN Well she’s… she’s not that straight, (inaudible ) but she’s. 

00:57:53
DON Hmm… 

00:57:55
JULIAN She is nice you know. I don't know if she… Yeah she’s… I still like imposing on it, like that though. I think she’d be alright. I’ll just say it will be pain for her to coming here and listening to me for long you know. 

00:58:15
DON Hmm… So… 

00:58:20
JULIAN But umm… We did get on every while. I mean, I’ve known her for, dear god. We’ve just, I haven’t been into it, but I’ve known her for a couple of years. 

00:58:35
DR. LINDA GASK In some situations, referral to another agency may be required to ensure safety. For example, in the cases of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, it’s important that the psychotic symptoms treated by an appropriate health professional. Let's rejoin the interview with Robbie and Nigel. The voices are worse and Nigel is now a fairly high suicide risk. 

00:59:00
ROBBIE Hi! That's what about three days since I last saw you now. 

00:59:05
NIGEL Hmm… 

00:59:05
ROBBIE I’m just wondering how things were going. 

00:59:10
NIGEL Not very well. 

00:59:15
[sil.] 

00:59:20
ROBBIE Otherwise I’ve got worsen. I’ve been taking the tablets, but they’re still there. I just feel tired as well now. 

00:59:35
[sil.] 

00:59:40
NIGEL I’m still awake at nights. And the voice is getting worse. I’m hearing it more. 

00:59:50
ROBBIE Have you tried to harm yourself again since? 

00:59:55
attempts at self harm 

00:59:55
NIGEL I haven't got another rope, you know. I’ve put it upon the guardrail again but I’m beginning to think that perhaps we gotto go somewhere else, and make sure I do it properly as if with, it won't do that. It won’t pull things down in another where I can hang myself. 

01:00:25
ROBBIE So you’re, you’re actually giving a feel of thought to… 

01:00:30
suicidal thoughts/plans 

01:00:30
ROBBIE …how you made do this successfully of, have successful is the right word? 

01:00:40
NIGEL Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel that when especially at night that it’s happening as I spoke during the day. 

01:00:50
[sil.] 

01:00:55
NIGEL After feeling that people are following me as well. It's getting worse, you know, I’m trying to staying and the voices you get were just saying, kill yourself, hang yourself. Go on, you’re never used to this anymore, hang yourself. It’s just getting worse. 

01:01:20
ROBBIE It seems like things are so distressing now it’s, it's virtually impossible to keep you safe where you are. I really think that you need to see one of my colleagues, a consultant psychiatrist. I want with (inaudible ) centre here. I think it will be really helpful, if you saw her. 

01:01:45
negotiates referral to psychiatrist 

01:01:50
NIGEL Uh…huh… A psychiatrist, I see, uh… 

01:02:00
[sil.] 

01:02:05
ROBBIE I know if I’m… Sorry. 

01:02:05
NIGEL What does that mean going to hospital? 

01:02:10
ROBBIE It may mean going into hospital. 

01:02:15
NIGEL Yeah. 

01:02:15
ROBBIE I wouldn’t like the second guess what you’ll say, but between yourself, the GP, myself, your friends and family, we try to make things better, but it sounds like things are still, they’re getting worse. And I sense like you’re becoming more desperate. 

01:02:40
NIGEL Umm… 

01:02:40
ROBBIE Is this not fear? 

01:02:45
NIGEL Yeah, I am. You know, I don’t really know what to do now. 

01:02:50
ROBBIE Uh…Huh… 

01:02:55
NIGEL I was… 

01:03:00
[sil.] 

01:03:05
NIGEL I was just holding on to things, I suppose. I don’t know whatever I can anymore. 

01:03:15
ROBBIE I think when things get that desperate, you really need some specialist help. 

01:03:20
NIGEL Umm… Who should see me here? 

01:03:25
ROBBIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:03:25
NIGEL Well! When, when? 

01:03:30
ROBBIE If you agree then I’d try and get over the phone immediately, we could go up and her. Or either we couldn’t see her or she’d come down through the health centre here. As quickly as possible, really I think, because it seems like things are quite desperate. 

01:03:50
NIGEL Yeah. I prefer to see her here. I am not, not very found of, no here. Huh… 

01:04:10
ROBBIE Are you happy enough if I start that refilling process then, yeah? 

01:04:10
NIGEL Yeah. 

01:04:15
DR. LINDA GASK In the final scenario in this section, Susan, a community psychiatric nurse is working with a female client, who’s got recurring thoughts of harming herself. What shall she attempt to challenge hopelessness and generate hopefulness in her clients? She particularly tries to challenge the dichotomous nature of her thinking and help her to look for alternatives to suicide. 

01:04:40
SUSAN I wondered if we could go back a little bit and maybe talk a little bit more like umm… you were talking before about having ideas about harming yourself, and having thought of ways in which you could do that. Does… Does that feel like it’s the only solution of the minute? 

01:05:05
explores alternatives 

01:05:05
I can’t think anything else, yeah. 

01:05:10
SUSAN Uh…Huh… But there are also things that you said that suggested that, there were reasons for staying alive as well. I wonder if we could talk a little bit more about them? 

01:05:25
Final nature of suicide. 

01:05:25
SUSAN You talked about your mum. 

01:05:30
She’ll be alright. I just want her to know that she was alright really. 

01:05:35
SUSAN Hmm… 

01:05:40
But I don’t think she had missed me awful or not. And she’s a bit… I mean if she’s… I mean, she knew the mess I was in anyway. That really ah… 

01:06:00
[sil.] 

01:06:05
God! I’m gonna really hurt her. 

01:06:10
SUSAN Because, even I guess saying that, it looks me that it is… it is a very… it is a very final solution, it is a very… very big thing to decide. And I wonder if, if may be, because it sounds like in a sense that all these things have happened to you, all these things have, in a sense blown out of your control. And that can feel very overwhelming. And I think in situations like that, it is possible for people to think, well the only, the only way out is to end my life, but I wonder if you’ve thought of that first. I wonder if maybe it’s been so overwhelming, that you haven’t thought about the possible things to explore, as ways of trying to get it back under control? 

01:06:55
There aren’t any. There aren’t any. 

01:07:05
SUSAN What have you thought of? 

01:07:05
Well I haven't, because I can’t, I can’t, I can’t think of anything that’s going to so solve. 

01:07:15
SUSAN Alright, right. 

01:07:15
I can’t think of how I am going to payoff all these things that Steve’s gone. I… I can’t think of that all I will work again. I can’t… And I know, I know, I do it myself, I know I can’t, you know that I just drink more, and I know, it doesn't help, I can't see, I have ever stopped doing that, and I can’t think of how I am just going to get through it all. There isn’t, there isn’t. 

01:07:50
SUSAN I mean, I guess in a sense you are right, because you are thinking of a lot of problems all at the same time, and as always like you, it’s I have lost my job, Steve has left me, my drinking, my debts, I might lose my home, my mother. So it’s a lot of problems, all of them together. I wonder if, if, if it might have been more helpful to, I don’t know, maybe try and separate them out a little. 

01:08:15
more realistic perspective of problems 

01:08:20
SUSAN It sounds like you are going to deal with everything all at the same time and that is pretty difficult. 

01:08:25
It is Impossible, yeah. 

01:08:25
empathic statement 

01:08:25
SUSAN Yeah, that is pretty hard. 

01:08:25
Aims of Problem Solving - To help patients to identify problems as a source of distress • To help patients to identify their psychosocial resources - To provide patients with a framework to think through problems logically • To enhance patients’ control over current and future problems 

01:08:30
DR. LINDA GASK In this next section, problem solving, we are going to look at problem solving as a means, to actually help patients to identify problems as a source of their distress, to identify their psychosocial resources, to provide them with a framework to think through problems logically and to enhance their control over current and future problems. 

01:08:55
Why Use Problem Solving? • It is easily learned - It has a wide application for many psychiatric disorders - It can be used in addition to medication - It is popular with patients • It is more accurate as patients generate their own solutions - It is less stressful for health professionals 

01:09:00
DR. LINDA GASK Problem solving is easily learned and has a wide application for many psychiatric disorders. It can be used in addition to medication, it’s popular with patients and it’s more accurate as patients actually generate their own solutions. It’s also less stressful for health professionals than them feeling that they always have to come up with all the answers to patients’ problems. 

01:09:20
Suitability For Problem Solving - Patient’s problems can be specified - Patient’s goals are realistic - Absence of severe acute psychiatric illness - Patient no longer in crisis (suicidal) situation - Patient able to take some responsibility for self 

01:09:25
DR. LINDA GASK In terms of accessing suitability for problem solving, the patients’ problems need to be able to be specified, their goals must be realistic and there must be absence of severe acute psychiatric illness. The patient must no longer be in a crisis situation, in other words acutely suicidal, and must be able to take some responsibility for themselves. 

01:09:50
STEPS IN PROBLEM SOLVING Define the problem to be tackled Brainstorm options for dealing with problems Examine pros & cons of each option. Choose one option. Rehearse option in imagination Carry out the chose option Review what happened 

01:09:50
DR. LINDA GASK We are going to take you through the steps in problem solving. First of all, you have to decide which problem to tackle first. Then generate options for dealing with the problem, We call this brainstorming. Then examine the pros and cons of each option. Get the patient to choose the best option and then to rehearse the option in imagination, before carrying out the option. Then review what’s happened. The crucial task is to get the patient to do the work. You saw this patient when she was acutely suicidal. At this point in time, the woman who is a school teacher, is having problems with the care of her mother. She is having difficulties looking after her mother because of school work. But her sister is unwilling to be involved in the care. She is going to work through this particular problem with one of her general practitioners’ partners. 

01:11:00
You were telling me that, umm… that you are already visiting your mother at weekends. 

01:11:10
Hmm… 

01:11:10
And your sister visits her during the week. 

01:11:10
Yeah. 

01:11:15
But that you feel that as a good daughter, you should in fact be doing more for your mother than you already are. 

01:11:20
Umm… 

01:11:20
And that your sister is not disposing some pressure on you to do this. 

01:11:25
Yeah. 

01:11:25
Is that a fair summary? 

01:11:30
I guess it’s yeah. 

01:11:30
Right. 

01:11:30
I mean, I am… I am actually closer, you know I live closer than my sister, really so, I do feel like I should be you know sorts of helping her during the week really. 

01:11:40
So you really feel under some pressure that you should be doing more? Right. 

01:11:45
Considers options 

01:11:45
What do you see as possible option to the dealing with this problem? 

01:11:55
[sil.] 

01:12:00
Well, I never have explained to whether you know, I need to do school work (inaudible ), it’s finding time really to, you know to, to go to mum’s. 

01:12:10
Right. Explain… Explain to whom? 

01:12:10
My Sister. 

01:12:10
To your sister, right. So one option is what you’ve already tried in fact, that is explaining to her your situation. What other options can you see to help you to resolve this problem? 

01:12:25
DR. LINDA GASK Two options emerge, making time to visit mother on weekdays or talking to her sister and explaining that this just isn’t possible because of the school work. The doctor and patient here begin to explore the advantages and disadvantages of each option. 

01:12:40
And shall we start with the option of you going once or twice during the week, as well as at the weekend. And I think we should look at the advantages and disadvantage of each. Can you see the advantages of doing that for you? 

01:12:55
Advantages 

01:13:00
Well umm… Oh yeah! I mean, (inaudible ) got me about that. 

01:13:05
Right, (inaudible ) gets of your back. Is there any other advantages? 

01:13:10
I suppose something wrong with me, pleased to see me. 

01:13:15
Uh…Huh… 

01:13:15
I don’t need to just… She really just saw mom’s whatever you go anyway, you know she doesn't sorts of, she shouldn't seem to appreciate that what you doing anyway as far as old age. 

01:13:25
She doesn’t? 

01:13:25
No. 

01:13:30
Alright. Okay. So, you doing the option of… of… of you going during the week as well as the weekends, you feel that it would get Sue off your back, because it was it, umm… that although your mother might not show much sign of it, she might appreciate you… 

01:13:45
Uh…Huh… 

01:13:50
…knowing more, now that’s some of the disadvantages you are doing that. 

01:13:50
Disadvantages 

01:13:55
I am trying to fit in, you know with… with what I am doing. 

01:13:55
Just trying to visiting with the rest of your life. 

01:14:00
DR. LINDA GASK They reach an agreement that talking to her sister is the favored option. Goals are then clarified. 

01:14:10
So… So, really what you’d be hoping to achieve when you talk with your sister is that she would agree to the situation, she would stop putting pressure on you. 

01:14:20
Clarifies goals 

01:14:25
Hmm… 

01:14:25
And also that you should come to an agreement about who’s going to visit… visit when presumably and would you be aiming to keep it as it is now? 

01:14:40
I like so, yeah. 

01:14:40
You think so? Right. 

01:14:40
It hurts me. 

01:14:40
Yes, thank you. So that’s the, that’s the two, the goals that you like of, of what, of the option that we’ve chosen, right. Now I think what we should do is, is look at the steps that we’re going to need to go through, or in fact that you’re going to need to go through, hopefully to achieve that goal, and to look some of the difficulties that might arise and how you might resolve those difficulties. Umm… What are the steps, in fact that you’ll need to go through to get there? 

01:15:10
Works out steps 

01:15:15
I’m… I need to find I suppose, we’ve have arranged to meet her. 

01:15:20
Alright. 

01:15:20
As I spoke to her I also… 

01:15:25
Alright. 

01:15:25
I will meet her. 

01:15:30
Either meet her or ask her to come to the house, right. 

01:15:30
DR. LINDA GASK It can be very helpful to work through the worst case scenario. 

01:15:40
Can you see what might be the worst possible response you’ll get from your sister? I think we should perhaps work through that? 

01:15:50
[sil.] 

01:15:55
I think the worst thing that’ll be that she’s, that she’ll say that, she’s done enough and she won’t, she’d just say she’s not going over that. 

01:16:05
Alright. 

01:16:10
I think she’ll blame that on me, you know she’ll say, she’ll say to my mum, that she’s not going out because of me. So my mum would blame me then. 

01:16:15
Right. 

01:16:15
Alright 

01:16:15
Right. 

01:16:20
You know, she’ll say that, I’ve caused this ruin, and then my mum will say that, she’ll say that she’s on her own all week, because if I have done in, you know, I think, I’ll just get, I don’t know, what I could do about that. 

01:16:40
DR. LINDA GASK Now watch the first part of this next excerpt from an interview, and consider how you could set about problem solving with Julian, the heroin user, user earlier. Don sets her by defining that her current main problem, now heroin use as being addressed, is her relationship with her boyfriend. 

01:17:00
JULIAN He takes back when I say so. 

01:17:05
DON And that could cause you problems I suppose if he came around? 

01:17:10
JULIAN Well, you know it was difficult, because he phoned me up and, didn't say anyhow, you know how you are going to get any more stuff, if you (inaudible ) you know any money and he didn’t have any, depend it’s just, it’s just always, always makes in my makes really, they are on the same crowd, you know and I was in this not always you just, just (inaudible ) to open a bit, and is beaten on again, (inaudible ) I can pull it over, I mean, you know, I looked in get (inaudible ). 

01:17:57
DON Sounds that you expect John to come around some time? 

01:18:00
JULIAN I thought, yeah. I think he may rather at the time, depends on his feelings you see, it’s just things when he wants. 

01:18:15
DR. LINDA GASK Now try and work through this using a problem solving approach. How can you help Julian to decide what to do about her boyfriend? 

01:18:20
Crisis Prevention · The aim is to devise a plan of action if a future crisis occurs - especially to prevent suicide in the context of recurring crisis situations · It is less applicable if a recent crisis occurred in a highly unusual set of circumstances which have now been resolved · Crisis prevention should be a collaborative effort between the therapist and the client · Crisis prevention should only occur once the immediate crisis has been diffused 

01:18:25
DR. LINDA GASK The final section in this videotape is on crisis prevention. The aim is to device a plan of action, if a future crisis occurs. Especially, to prevent suicide in the context of recurring crisis situations. It’s less applicable if a recent crisis occurred in a highly unusual set of circumstances which are now being resolved. We must stress that crisis prevention should be collaborative, and it should only occur once the immediate crisis has actually been diffused. 

01:19:00
MYTH! CRISIS PREVENTION IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY MYTH! SUICIDE PREVENTION MEASURES ARE A DRAIN ON RESOURCES WHICH WOULD BE BETTER USED ELSEWHERE 

01:19:05
DR. LINDA GASK All frontline workers have a role to play in suicide prevention. And there are really long term benefits to be gained from trying to do some crisis prevention. We are going to look at the following stages. 

01:19:15
Stages of Crisis Prevention · Explore exact circumstances which led up to the current crisis(situation, symptoms, behavior) · Asses the likelihood that the exact circumstances leading to the crisis will be repeated in the short/medium term(i.e. have the difficulties been resolved?) · Help the patient to recognise early warning signs of a crisis · Devise alternative coping strategies once the person recognizes the crisis: (Distraction; Support; Problem Solving) 

01:19:20
DR. LINDA GASK Explore the exact circumstances, which led up to the current crisis. What was the situation? What were the symptoms that the person experienced? What was their behavior? Then go on and assess the likelihood that the exact circumstances will be repeated in the short or medium term. Have the problems been resolved? Then go on to help the person to recognize their own personal early warning signs of a crisis. What symptoms did they experience in their body? What thoughts go through their head? And then help them to device alternative coping strategies, once they recognize the crisis. 

01:20:05
DR. LINDA GASK Now let’s go back to the interview with Barry and the teacher. The school inspection isn’t going to help him for sometime again. But the likelihood of her rowing with her husband is fairly high. Barry moves on to assessing early warning signs and then looks to alternative coping strategies. 

01:20:25
BARRY How often are those really bad rows? 

01:20:30
Assess likelihood of circumstances recurring 

01:20:35
I’ve two really bad ones. 

01:20:35
BARRY Hmm…Hmm… Did you know they were going to happen? 

01:20:45
Identify early waring signs 

01:20:45
Hmm… (inaudible ) and on both times it had. 

01:20:50
BARRY Hmm… Why? 

01:20:55
[sil.] 

01:21:00
Because I got feelings of getting him sad. 

01:21:05
BARRY Okay. 

01:21:05
And I think that’s when he’s starts getting really, that’s what makes him angry, he gets worse, and I get more upset. 

01:21:10
BARRY Uh… 

01:21:15
And then he just walks out. 

01:21:20
BARRY Right. Which leaves you… 

01:21:20
I’m a male. 

01:21:20
BARRY Yeah. 

01:21:25
[sil.] 

01:21:30
And that’s when I feel desperate. Hmm… 

01:21:35
BARRY I’ve been recognizing that is important, because those are the times that are most dangerous for you. 

01:21:45
[sil.] 

01:21:50
BARRY Those are the rows that you know are going to happen, that leave you feeling so bad afterwards. And so far John has been there. What if he wasn’t? What do you think would happen then? 

01:22:10
It actually crossed my mind, when I last found her that she wouldn’t be innocent but. 

01:22:15
BARRY Hmm… 

01:22:15
I don’t know. 

01:22:20
BARRY Have you thought about what you could do then? 

01:22:20
Alternative coping strategies 

01:22:20
No. She was so. 

01:22:25
BARRY Hmm… 

01:22:30
I didn’t have to. 

01:22:35
BARRY No! If she’s not, perhaps you would need to be able to phone someone else? 

01:22:40
Three alternative supports 

01:22:40
BARRY And if you’ve not shared it within the family otherwise, then the Samaritans. And they are there just to contact, just to talk, just to let off steam when you’re feeling so pent up. And… And having their number, (inaudible ), you can have hope. Confirm… 

01:23:07
Hmm… 

01:23:10
BARRY Confirm the duty doctor. It won’t always be me, but you still got someone there that you could find. 

01:23:20
DR. LINDA GASK Don go through some similar steps, in his session with Julian. It looks that how she’ll cope if the problems with her boyfriend, lead to have feeling once more at risk of harming herself. 

01:23:35
DON Hi Julian. Umm… I guess we better talk about what might happen and you might feel if he did turn up? 

01:23:45
JULIAN Huh… I was always thinking about it really. 

01:23:55
[sil.] 

01:24:00
JULIAN It depend on what he did, wouldn't he. Oh yeah. 

01:24:10
DON Well, the worst came to the worst when he did turn up on your doorstep, and he got quite nasty with you. Don’t you think he would react to that? 

01:24:25
JULIAN I was always try and calm him down, you know I’m… 

01:24:30
[sil.] 

01:24:35
JULIAN I just stop (inaudible ) with him and. I don’t know what. I mean, I’ve tried arguing with him once and it was worse. 

01:24:50
Rehearse coping strategies 

01:24:55
JULIAN You know he’s got a bit, he started kicking stuff around and he held my wrist. And with and did some stuff. 

01:25:05
DON So, are you saying you’re tough to go along with… with whatever he wanted you to… to have him try and calm him down? 

01:25:15
JULIAN It’s all what I can to do, because he’s… 

01:25:20
[sil.] 

01:25:25
JULIAN Just a pin drop. I mean, if he’s… if he was ah… been affiliated with some, somehow I can… 

01:25:40
[sil.] 

01:25:45
DON What would happen to you? Do you know what I mean? What… How would you feel inside if he came around and he behaves like that? 

01:25:55
JULIAN Well just go on and I (inaudible ). 

01:26:00
[sil.] 

01:26:05
JULIAN It will be much… It will be much pull-up anymore with him really. If he was… If he was going to… He just started taking stuff. Oh god! Why will he do that to? He took his last girlfriend to stuff and he made it sound so. 

01:26:30
DON You say, it wouldn’t be much point any more? What do you mean by that? 

01:26:35
Clarification 

01:26:40
JULIAN Well, if I try and get myself out of this mess and stuff, what’s gonna be the point if he keeps coming around and… 

01:26:50
[sil.] 

01:26:55
JULIAN I think I’d be really… I think I’d… I’d be ready to go myself. I think I’ve to… or go down again, I think. 

01:27:05
DON Do you start to feel well pretty hopeless again? That you think you are a weaker to with him? 

01:27:15
JULIAN Yeah. 

01:27:15
DON Hmm…Hmm… 

01:27:15
JULIAN I feel much better when he’s not around. Yeah, in the first couple of days I felt… I felt a bit better, because he’s not been around, but then I’ve been worried that he’s gonna come around and start you know, look again. 

01:27:35
DON Okay! So if John came around to the fight, he behaved the way that you think he’s going to behave, and you reckon you’d be at risk again. You might start to feel suicidal again so. 

01:27:45
JULIAN Yeah. 

01:27:45
DON Yeah. 

01:27:50
JULIAN Oh god! It was all, if he does not. 

01:28:00
DON So, there is always a possibility that you might Julian, we ought to do… we ought to talk about how you’re going to deal with that situation if it came along, that he came around. Well, you feel pretty terrible about it, you might be at risk again, you might consider killing yourself again, even? 

01:28:20
JULIAN Yeah. 

01:28:25
DON So, I guess we ought to think about how you’re going to handle that situation again? You’ve handled things very well over the last week. I think you done amazingly. 

01:28:30
Encouragement 

01:28:35
DON And I hope, you know, I don’t think either, if he wants you to step back again. So um… Let’s think about practical things you can do. If John came around, practical things that you can do, to put yourself less at risk, maybe you can’t prevent him coming around, maybe you are not physically, maybe you can’t prevent that. But how are you going to deal with the situation? 

01:29:00
DR. LINDA GASK A little further on, they start to look for potential early warning signs that Julian is at risk of self-harm, signs of emotional distress. From this, it will be possible to move on to ways of attempting to prevent crisis, getting support, looking for alternatives to risking behavior, controlling her arousal. 

01:29:25
JULIAN I don’t know, you tell me what to do? I feel really sick. 

01:29:30
DON How do you know when you at risk? How do you know when you’re going down again? 

01:29:35
JULIAN I sort of feel, I sort feel depressed, yeah. 

01:29:40
Early warning signs 

01:29:45
JULIAN Just start… start thinking about it, not being able to think about anything else really. Uh…Huh… 

01:29:50
DON Do you start having these thoughts about… 

01:29:55
JULIAN Yeah. 

01:29:55
DON …about killing yourself again? Yeah! And you do anything? You know, the way before you’re like buying a pack of razor blades? 

01:30:05
JULIAN Sometimes, I sort of ah… I thought there was sometimes. 

01:30:15
DON Yeah! Since your early times yeah? 

01:30:20
JULIAN Well, kicking stuff around but. 

01:30:20
DON So you get open round up and pretty anxious, yeah. 

01:30:25
JULIAN Yeah. 

01:30:30
JULIAN And like, yeah. 

01:30:35
DON I guess maybe Julian there are some things that you can do, something about and a lot of things that you can’t, and maybe we can (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

01:30:40
JULIAN Maybe we can’t those although. 

01:30:45
DON Well! Maybe you can’t prevent John coming around, but maybe you can do something about the consequences of that. Maybe you can do something about the way that he makes you feel. 

01:31:00
[sil.] 

01:31:05
DR. LINDA GASK This videotape has covered assessment, crisis management, problem solving and crisis prevention. Every case requires assessment and crisis management. Some cases also require problem solving and all crisis prevention. You need an opportunity to practice these skills now. What would we like to emphasize finally is that you can’t really learn how to do this by simply watching a videotape.
