Jay Haley Workshop 

00:00:00
Directive Therapy for Problems at the Stages of the Family Life Cycle 

00:00:00
filmed by Madeleine Richeport-Haley edited by Madeleine Richeport-Haley & Jay Haley 

00:00:00
JAY HALEY (1923-2007) was known as one of the founders of the field of family therapy, strategic therapy, and brief therapy. His early work was in collaboration with some of the foremost thinkers of our time such as, Gregory Bateson and Milton H. Erickson, MD> He was a professor at Stanford University, Howard University, the University of Maryland, and at the California School of Professional Psychology. He published more than 20 books and over a hundred papers. 

00:00:00
JAY HALEY ...Say a bit about what you're in for today. What I'll do is talk about therapy centering for a while and then about a particular way of working and active brief therapy that, uh, is done in the framework of family life cycle. (inaudible ) ways to, uh, clarify your destination, because the, uh, families at various stages. And one of the goals of therapy is to move from one stage of problems to another stage of problems. The, uh, workshop, the way I do it, is to have, uh, talk about ideas, and then to play videotapes illustrating those ideas and then have a discussion. The videotapes I should say something about. They're, uh, the actual families in the, uh, therapy are on the video that I show in the workshop. We'll study the, uh, cases we present them by themselves are of a different order. They're inactive because of the problem of confidentiality. 

00:02:00
Confidentiality issues 

00:02:00
JAY HALEY But, let me bring up confidentially here, too. Even though I'm bucked(ph) because these are actual families, it's important that if you happen to know anybody in one of these families, you'd excuse yourself, because they give permission to these used for training, these tapes, but not for pals to see. Let me, uh, say a little bit. Well, let me ask you a question. How many people here have been trained in one of my mirror rooms? Okay. How many regularly sit down with whole families? Okay. How many consider themselves competent in hypnosis? Okay. Now I know all about you. I can be ready. One of the things about the, the videotapes is that they are technically in difficulty at times. 

00:03:00
Filming Behind the One-Way Mirror 

00:03:00
JAY HALEY It's, uh, it's difficult to get a setup in a one way mirror room with cameras, where the cameras work the way they should, and the sound works the way it should, and the patient behaves the way the patient should as well. And the therapist does what ought to be done. And the supervisor sees that it all happens correctly. But, sometimes we get, uh, good tapes without any, when they are, then they're interesting I think, because you can emphasize what actually happened in the sessions. And what the intervening techniques were and so on. It isn't let's talk about patients. There's real data here. The, uh, let me say something. I think this is a very exciting time, because there's no, uh, orthodoxy. And when there's no orthodoxy, you can't be a deviant. So, if you, it used to be, back years ago, that if you started a new technique, you were condemned. But now, you're made a school. Give it a name and all that. It doesn't have to be much of a school to get quite a bit of publicity. But, it's a curious time, when there's no orthodoxy. And there's a consequence for that, I think, for you, all of us, and that is, uh, that there's no right way to do therapy. There's no orthodoxy. There's no agreement. On this, you'd think that after a hundred years, there'd be agreement on, uh, on how to diagnose a problem, how to make an intervention, how to, uh, follow up, make sure it was successful. That is, these sorts of things have been going on for quite a while. But, there isn't even agreement you should formulate a problem. Some therapists feel that's too focused. You should (inaudible ). Others, uh, don't feel you should deliberately make an intervention, because that's just somehow not correct. It's, it's a time when, uh, anything goes in a way that's not too immoral. But, it's a, uh, curious time. And I thought I'd talk for a while about, uh, the different opportunities this gives you for what your obligations are. 

00:05:45
Choose Your Own Theory 

00:05:45
JAY HALEY You have to choose your own theory. And, uh, you have to choose the right theory, whatever that is. But, it has to be the right one for you in any event. But, these, uh, these theories, you never know for sure whether they're true or not. It used to be that, that we, we knew what the truth was. We would investigate it's cause in the past of the symptom. And, uh, make somebody aware of it, and that would solve a lot of the problems. But, the, uh, question has still come up about whether the past is true the way it's described. That, uh, there's a question about it. It's a curious time, but it is a time when you have to make your own theory. That is, you go to a workshop, and there's one presentation. And the, you find it disagrees with your school training, so you go to another workshop, and that's different yet. And you go to another and you have the problem, how do you fit all these together and which one do you choose among? And it used to be people did it for you. And, that's not so clear that they're doing it for you now. They're leaving it up to you, so you have to think about, uh, about the problems. Let me give an example. If you're a therapist watcher, which I was in research for years, you watch therapists, and you try to figure out why they do what they do. And you talk to them about it. And, sometimes they sound coherent, sometimes they sound like (inaudible ). That is, there's a lot of therapists who know what to do, but they don't know how to describe it or talk about it. And when you're a researcher, you try and get them to describe it. Often, what comes up is they're doing something on the basis of a different theory than you think it is. It's not so obvious. I'll give an example. A therapist named Leo Schiff(ph), I'll show some tapes of him today. He's a very skilful therapist. He had a, a woman come to him referred by her pediatrician for a twelve year old boy who wet the bed, and had always wet the bed. And the mother had taken him everywhere there was to go to stop this wetting from happening and it went on. So, she went to this pediatrician, and he referred to Dr. Schiff. And Dr. Schiff said what a directive therapist will say, "Are you willing to do anything to get this boy over this problem?" And she said, "Yes." And Dr. Schiff said, "Well, I want you to give him fifty dollars every time he wets the bed." She said, "All right." And the boy made about 150 dollars. I think he wet the bed three times and stopped. And the mother was talking to the pediatrician about how that happened. And the pediatrician said, "That man is crazy. You don't reward a kid for having something you're trying to get rid of." And the mother said, "Well, I don't care. He stopped wetting the bed." But, obviously, Dr. Schiff was on one wavelength, and the pediatrician was on another. The pediatrician was thinking in terms of learning theory, positive conditioning and so on. And it's curious how, uh, you can have a different kind of theory come in once the field gets opened up, and I think it is. What if you think about what are you gonna have to do these days. You gotta have a theory. And, uh, it's always a question. What theory? You need a theory of why people are the way they are. Why do they behave the way they do? And, uh, you also need a theory of change. How do you change? And those are not necessarily connected to each other. The reason a person has a symptom may not be involved with how to get them over it. But, it is, therapists are always better on what's wrong with people than they are with change. If you're talking to a therapist, and you ask him, uh, why this person has this symptom, he'll talk at length, or she'll talk at length, about why that symptom is there. It's roots in the past and so on. If you ask, uh, the person what's your theory on how to change that, they tend to become inarticulate. They say, "Well, I do this. It can help them become aware." But, it isn't as clear what you should do to get people over a problem as it is the cause. You know, there is an interesting occurrence. If you think about therapy, it's a hundred years old, you know, maybe a little more. But, back in about 1880, according to Ellenberger, who wrote an interesting book on the, uh, unconscious. I think it's for the discover of the unconscious or it my be the creation of the unconscious. It's a question of which is what happened? But, in 1880 a group of intelligent people were trying to figure out why do some people say, "I can't help myself. I have to do this. I can't stop" That is, they claimed that they're just unable to stop or they, uh, claimed they can't do it. "I can't go across that bridge. I just get in a panic if I go across that bridge." And it's a question, why do they behave that way? 

00:11:35
3 Major Theories in the 19th Century to Explain Human Behavior 

00:11:35
JAY HALEY And according to Ellenberger, what they came up with was three explanations. One was, uh, multiple personality in 1880. It's interesting. It's another personality took over and that's why the person does what he does. He says, "I don't know why I do this." And, that was very big. It died away except with Milton Erickson, who, uh, was studying it. For years he was studying multiple personality. And had an interesting theory that it wasn't pathological. It's just that there's people with two personalities or more. But, he never got into the 300 personalities cases that some people are these days. But, anyhow, that was an explanation, not that it was a popular one. And, what happened is it disappeared. As I understand the figures in the 19, in the 1980's there was something like 2,000 multiple personalities at the beginning of the 80's. By the end of the 80's, there was something like 6,000. They were multiplying everywhere. And, uh, now it's tending to go out of fashion, I think. The popularity came in with the theory that child abuse was causing multiple personalities, and, uh, therefore people were, it was a comfortable explanation to work with. There were some people with whole practices that are multiple personalities. 

00:13:10
Spirit Possession 

00:13:10
JAY HALEY But, at any rate there was another explanation, and that was spirit possession. That a person was possessed by a spirit and therefore they couldn't do what they're supposed to do, or they couldn't stop doing what they were supposed to do. Now, I don't know whether spirits are very big in San Bernadino. In the world they're very big. It's the most popular explanation of pathology. It's very big in Africa, in China, South America, particularly. As I understand it, there is something like 30,000 spirit sighters(ph) in Rio.(ph) And that's just the legal ones. And it's, they do some interesting work in terms of getting people over problems. They, uh, for example, if there's a malevolent spirit causing the problem, they'll work to turn the malevolent spirit into a positive spirit who helps others. And then, uh, he gets cured in the process of helping others, which is an interesting way to work. There was another explanation. They had three of them. 

00:14:25
The Unconscious 

00:14:25
JAY HALEY And that was the unconscious. That your unconscious drives you to do things, and you don't know what you're doing because it's the unconscious. It's an interesting theory, and Freud took it on and built a whole society on it. It's, it's more questionable now, because it, to have a good theory of the unconscious, you have to believe what people say about their past, and there's a lot of question about whether, what people say about their past is true. There's a new era coming in, although, uh, that came up with Freud. 

00:15:10
S. Freud (1896) "heredity adnt eh Aetiology of the Neurosis" 

00:15:10
JAY HALEY You know there's an interesting paper by Freud in 1896, where he says that out of thirteen women with hysterical diagnosis, thirteen out of thirteen were sexually abused by their, uh, relatives, often a brother who was himself sexually abused, which was known at that time. But at any rate, this made the, made it active in families that sex was going on. Then, uh, Freud changed his theory, and nobody quite knows why. But, he said they weren't telling the truth or many of them weren't. Even though previously he said it takes tremendous effort to get the truth about the abuse out. The women don't just admit it. It takes sometimes a long time in analysis for them to really work it out. If it does then it's a question of if the therapist is participating in the creating of it. And that's one of the curious things about hypnosis. Hypnosis was at the birth of all therapy, I think. I mean, even the, uh, behavior therapists came from Pavlov, who was a hypnotist. Freud was a hypnotist. And, uh, nowadays, anything that's marginal, there's a hypnotist involved. If you're interested in, uh, in aliens from other planets visiting and picking you up, you discover that and explore it in hypnosis. There's a hypnotist to help you do that. There's, uh, past lives. People not only regress people back in this life, but they take them to the previous life and find the cause of a symptom. And the person who takes them back to that previous life is usually a, uh, hypnotist. Interesting. 

00:17:15
Hypnosis is One of the Best Trainings for Therapists 

00:17:15
JAY HALEY I think, uh, hypnosis is one of the best trainings there is I n how to formulate a problem, how to make an intervention, how to get somebody to do something, how to motivate people. That process, hypnosis training, you can't get that training in any other therapy and up until recently. But, at any rate, uh, hypnosis is a very popular thing. It, it used to come up with every war. It, after the First World War, shell shock was cured with hypnosis. After the Second World War, the equivalent of shell shock was dealt with with hypnosis. By the Korean War, it didn't disappear. It stayed. So that hypnosis has been a very popular deal. At any rate, that's, uh, you need a theory of why people do what they do, and you can choose spiritism or the unconscious or... What I'm getting at is that theories aren't necessarily true. They're just what you can create. And if you find some evidence for it, it's nice, but there's a lot of lack of evidence for theories of psychotherapy, which gives you freedom to think and do quite a few variety of things. It's, uh, it's a situation where the theory of change, you can, uh, develop on your own. But, let me say some of the things about the choices you have if you're gonna have your own theory of change.. 

00:18:55
Theories of Change 

00:18:55
JAY HALEY There's a lot of theories out there you can borrow from when you want to do this. 

00:19:00
Psychodynamic Theory 

00:19:00
JAY HALEY And, uh, the traditional psychodynamic is still around in the big cities at least. Or the idea is prominent. The theory of repression is still powerful. I get some young students, and I'm a live supervisor, and I ask them not to, uh, ask people to express their feelings on the idea that if you express your feelings it's good for you. It's lifting the repression. It's very hard to get the young people not to say, "How do you feel?" They feel it's built in to therapy somehow. That's the way your supposed to do it. Or is it hard, if you ask them not to make interpretation, it's very difficult for them not to make interpretation. So, it's a serious problem of mine. How to get rid of ideas if you decide that ideas should be gotten rid of. How do you go about doing that? Because these are powerful ideas that hang on in the training programs. Certainly the training programs still are psychodynamic care. Theorizing. They're trying to do brief therapy and teach some of those ideas. But, brief therapy is not a popular therapy, and, and you need a theory for that if you're going to do it. Or you need to do it, uh, and make up a theory that makes sense out of it. Because everything is brief now. If you give a workshop, it has to be a brief workshop. If you write a paper, it has to be the longitudinal studies of brief therapy. It's, it's one of those days or one of those decades that, uh, brief is in. I say that having been through some experiences back in the 50's where everything sounded. 

00:21:00
Brief Therapy 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY If you did a brief therapy, you were absolutely condemned. You were just too shallow to be concerned with. Now, if you do a long term therapy, you're condemned. So, we have the opposite is happening to us. It's a curious time. At any rate, the psychodynamic has certain premises that you have to adapt(ph) with. For one thing, it's non-directive. You don't tell anybody what to do. And, uh, it's a neutral therapist. We used to think if we spoke in a monotone, and had a dead pan expression we weren't influencing the clientele. And I think people gave that idea up, that you can't not influence someone. Uh, once you realize there's communication in a therapy room. You've got two people (inaudible ) introduce the idea of two people in the therapy room with Sullivan. And at that time, the therapist was just a projection of the patient. It wasn't, there wasn't a person in there. Sullivan said there was a person there who was causing the patient to do what the patient was doing. And, uh, that opened up a big debate back in the late 40's, where many analysts got very upset over the idea that they were there in the room. Because all of a sudden you're responsible if a patient stops hallucinating. Sullivan would say, uh, what did he, what did you do just before he started hallucinating? And, you don't like to dwell on that sometimes. It was an interesting , uh, supervision. 

00:22:40
Supervised by Don Jackson, MD 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY I had an old friend, Don Jackson, who supervised me, and was personally supervised by Sullivan. And, uh, it was a hard time, particularly because you had to explain what you were doing all the time. That this wasn't just a blank screen. And a blank screen's seemed better or easier. You were less responsible. Actually, the psychodynamic therapist weren't responsible. They, uh, they were responsible for making the situation where change could occur, but they weren't responsible for the change. If you asked an analyst is it your job to change people, he'll say, "No, it's my job to help people understand themselves. Then if they change, they change." So, it's a curious thing. They also assume that awareness causes change. Most fields of therapy have that idea, that if you make somebody aware of why they're doing what they're doing, they won't do it anymore. It's a, uh, it's some evidence that therapists, therapy was born in universities. Where in the universities, they feel that understanding and being wise is everything. When you realize that is if you train people off the street to be therapists, which I have done. 

00:24:00
Training Community Therapists 

00:24:00
JAY HALEY They don't have the same awareness, the same ideas in the same way. In fact, they, uh, they have a different set of ideas that have their problems too. I'm trying to think of a case. Oh, there was a mother who kept a boy home because she thought he was retarded. And there was some doubt about that, but his life was very restricted because she kept him home to protect, protect him. And, uh, the therapist , a street therapist, community therapist saw the family, and spent an hour with that woman and never once suggested she was overprotective of the child, which is a feat. When you're a supervisor, you don't want people to do that. That, that's quite a feat. What he did was say that the boy was reaching an age now where he had to be able to act ou on the street safely. So, could she sit on the front porch, and he go, she wouldn't let him out of the house before. Could she sit on the front porch while he, uh, played in the street in front of the house. And she said she thought she could do that. And then he had her let the boy get the experience, go down to the corner and back. And, it was about four weeks before the boy was out there shooting basketball and mother didn't know where he was, like all the other kids. So that, uh, this was worked out by the therapist because it had such a clear goal, that the, the goal was to get the kid out on the street enjoying himself. It wasn't to help him understand why he was doing what he was doing. You know that case had another situation. The mother, after a couple of sessions, only the, the boy said his father was talking to him upstairs, and his father had died a few months before, so he probably wasn't. The boy, the therapist didn't say or go into a diagnostic stance of how crazy is this youth. What he did is, uh, "What is your father talking to you about?" And the boy says, "He says I should get a bicycle." So, the therapist said to the mother, "Can he have a bicycle?" And she said, "Yes, he can have one, but he can't ride it." And a week or two later, the mother said to the therapist, "You know, my husband comes in at night sometimes. Comes up the stairs, lies down beside me on the bed with a big sigh, and then goes away." And most professionals I was trained with would be very worried about that hallucination. This therapist wasn't at all. He, uh, he said back to her, "I gather you must be lonely without your husband." Or something as simple as that. So, anyhow, what I'm getting at is there's a variety of ways to theorize about therapy. And what's becoming clear is we should use a theory that gives us the most practical results in therapy room. And, uh, sometimes making people aware of their situation is good, sometimes it's not. At any rate, uh, if you take the psychodynamic theories of the 1950's, they were absolutely opposite of the behavior theories of the 1950's, when that came in. 

00:27:55
Behavior Therapy 

00:27:55
JAY HALEY The learning therapies, which were so different. They were not non-directive. They were directive. They told people what to do. They took responsibility and said that if the case fails, the therapist fails. They had no interest in insight in those days. And what they did was try to change reinforcements. That was their theory of change. You know, I was in a, in on the birth of that in Hawaii. Whatever behavior therapy was, and it was pretty complicated, there was also some simple stuff there. I remember, uh, that two young men, I shared, I was on the (inaudible) bases research project. We shared a building with some young psychologists, and, uh, once a week the research people would present something to the staff that was of interest. So the staff would get wiser and wiser. And these behaviorists said they had a new form of therapy. And they wanted to present it. So, it was agreed. And, uh, apparently what happened is that somebody decided they could positively reinforce animals and get specific changes they wanted. Then somebody had the idea that you could do it to humans, which was a revolutionary idea. In fact, they then took the next step and said that therapists personally could be the reinforcement, which sound like it could be obvious, but that was a tremendous step really. Anyhow, they presented, and what they did was say that essentially, this was to an audience of staff at the VA hospital, all analysts with a training analyst, an older guy who was pretty conservative. Anyhow, they presented this idea. If you want a person to behave a certain way, when he behaves that way, you nod and smile. When he doesn't behave that way, you don't respond. And they said, if you do this for an hour or so, you'll have a very emotional patient. If that's what you're doing is rewarding him every time he has an emotion and you want that. So, you can produce emotions by nodding your head, is what they were saying . And the old training director said, uh, he stood up and said, "This is immoral and improper and should not be done. You have not right to influence people directly like that. And, uh, if you do influence them, it can't be outside their awareness. That's wrong." So, one of the young men defended themselves by saying, "Well, you do this anyhow all the time. If your patient does what you like, you tend to nod and smile. If he doesn't, you don't." And the old guy said, uh, "If you do it and you don't know you're doing it, that's okay." And that's the way a lot of people feel about directives. If you do them inadvertently, that's okay, but deliberately, it becomes manipulation. At any rate, I think it's interesting that when they go different, two schools of therapy, they go opposite. They seem to. There's another, with family therapy there came in six or eight schools of therapy, which were interesting. And I think the most interesting one was the one that took up directives and was an active family therapy. 

00:31:40
Strategic Family Therapy 

00:31:40
JAY HALEY It got the name strategic because of that. It was a, uh, it was different from the others. It wasn't individual like in psychodynamic, nor diatic like the behavioral. A behaviorist would program a mother to do, deal with, differently with her child. And, uh, would not notice what this did to the husband, because they weren't thinking in organizations. They were thinking in units of two. And the, uh, husband would be upset because he also was trying to program that child and his wife. So, that, uh, when they get upset and they get in conflict, the therapist can produce without any intention but with the problem that the, uh, theory led them to that. 

00:32:35
The Symptom has a Positive Function 

00:32:35
JAY HALEY But, the revolution, I think, in family therapy was the idea that the symptom has a positive function or certainly a function. That, uh, it always before that, before the 1950's where everything happened, before that, a symptom came out of the past and was appropriate to the past, but not to the present, because it was caused by a past trial or something like that. With family therapy it was argued that the symptom has a current function. That, uh, that it, it's serving a purpose in the system of people. And that was an idea that, uh, was pretty controversial. And some of it still is, I think, because many people still feel that the presence, that the past causes the present. The fact that another person causes the present is a revolutionary idea. Let me give an example of what I want you to understand. Once family therapy came along, we got into the question, is a family with a schizophrenic different from a family with a delinquent kid? Is that different from a family with an asthmatic? Or just a normal child doing okay. We were testing families and finding out that nobody had ever done that. And nobody knew how to do it, because all the testing was perceptual. You give some sort of a test to measure a person's perception, and he'd need to interview them about their families and so on. But, essentially, you're doing individual research, which, uh, isn't what you want. What you want is some systematic research which will show how a person reacts in relation to other people, not in relation to their thinking or anxieties or whatever. And that was a difficult, uh, way of thinking. For example, I remember standing behind a one-way mirror in a testing lab that I had. 

00:34:50
Research on Families 

00:34:50
JAY HALEY And I was waiting for the family to settle down, and I was going to give them a test. And while I was waiting, I saw a sequence that really was what I wanted to test, but I didn't know how to get it. What I saw was, uh, the boy. There was a mother, father and a boy. The boy, uh, looked under the table. The father said, "Don't look under the table." Mother said, "Don't pick on the boy." The father said, "He shouldn't look under the table." A few minutes later, the boy fooled with the microphone, and the father said, "Don't fool with the microphone." The mother said, "Leave the boy alone." And the father said, "He shouldn't be fooling with the microphone." And I watched this sequence go, and that's the sequence which we wanted to measure or at least the sequence at that time. We had no way to do it. We tried a variety of ways. And, uh, it was never successfully done. But, that was the problem with, that therapists had when they had the systems theory idea. 

00:35:50
Systems Theory 

00:35:50
JAY HALEY They had the idea that, uh, that, uh, what a person did was the product of what another person did. And how can you measure that and show it how it changed in therapy, because you wanna say it changed in therapy if it did, because testing families before therapy and after was also being done. At any rate, systems theory began to be pretty popular even though nobody was too clear what it was. It was, uh, it was a situation where it sounded more profound than it really was. But, the real problem with is it the model is a self-corrective system that if for example, one person goes too far the other will react. If the other goes too far, the other will react. That's what a systemic, systemic action is. And, uh, that's not a theory of change. That's a theory of how not to change, because anything that happened to start changing would, would react in such a way that, that is if the mother goes to far, the father reacts. If the father goes too far, the mother reacts. If they both go to far, the kid reacts. But, it's all to stabilize, is what it's doing, which is not a very good theory for change. But, we still struggle with it. There was another theory developing in the 1950's where everything happened. 

00:37:35
Stages of the Family Life Cycle 

00:37:35
JAY HALEY And that was, uh, an idea that family, the family life cycle clarifies therapy and change. And I'll be doing more of this with cases later, but, uh, what it, what it becomes obvious is that the stages of family life have conflicts. And that the, uh, the goals get more clear. Let me give you an example of many of us discovered families inadvertently . Not because we set out to discover families or do a, to do a family therapy. But, it happened in interesting ways for a number of people. The way it happened for me, one aspect of it, was, uh, I was referred a young lady who had a shaking right hand. Wouldn't stop shaking, and she was, she couldn't hold a pencil. She was going to lose her job over this. 

00:38:50
A Case that Led to the Family Life Cycle Approach 

00:38:50
JAY HALEY She went to a psychiatrist friend of mine, who put her through all kinds of neurological tests. And, uh, was working with her in therapy on her childhood experiences. Then he got worried because she was gonna lose her job, so he referred her to me for hypnosis to do something about her hand while he dealt with the deeper problems, which is how we worked in the 1950's. We took care of the symptoms, and others took care of the deeper problems. But, I, uh, hypnotized the young lady. She was a very good subject. And, uh, I suggested her hand quiet down, and the hand quieted down. And the other hand started to shake, the left hand, which didn't seem to be a neurological connection. I think I could have made her big toe shake, for that matter. She was a very good subject. But, uh, her left hand went, was shaking, and the right hand stopped. So, I woke her up, and she said, "Well, my left hand is shaking." And I said, "Well, isn't that better? You don't write with your left hand. You can file things and everything at work.' She said, "I don't want any hand to shake." So, I put her back into trance and gave her positive suggestions about not shaking at the wrong time or whatever. Then I woke her up and talked to her, and I asked her something I was asking in those days, the magic question. Was, uh, what if this gets worse? And she said, "Well, if it gets worse, I'll lose my job." And I said, "Well, what if you lose your job?" And she said, "My husband will have to go to work." And I had a flash of insight. That I decided I could think about this problem as either just her problem or a diatic problem. And, uh, her husband was a young guy just out of the navy. She was 18. And, uh, he didn't know whether to get a job or go back to school. Meanwhile, she was supporting him, and threatening not to be supporting him. So, I said, being naïve in those days, "How does your family react to this situation? Do they approve of your husband not working?" She said, "No, they don't approve at all. They want me to break up." She said, "My mother calls me every day, and she says, 'Are you coming home today?' And I say, 'Mother, I'm married now. I have my own place.' And she sayd, 'Well, that won't last.'" And the next day, the mother would call again and say, "Are you coming home today?" So, I began to suspect that this was a wider unit than husband and wife. That you could think about the in-laws involved in this problem. And, you had to think about it though, what to do about it. And I fooled around, mostly with hypnosis and the young lady. And I taught the husband how to hypnotize her. And when she actually was anxious, he could help her quiet down. And, uh, everything went well. She stopped her hand shaking. The husband went to work. Her parents began to support the marriage, and I took the credit, of course. But, I began to suspect I didn't deserve it, as I thought over this problem. Because, what happened was, uh, she got pregnant. And when she got pregnant, her husband had to go to work. And her parents, who wanted her home, didn't want her at home with the baby So, they began to support the marriage. And I realized this could have happened without a therapist involved at all. That, one way to think about it was that it was stages of family life. This couple were in the stage of, of not having children. They have a child, it opens up a whole new stage there. It changes parents into grandparents. It changes so many things. And, uh, once you begin to think that way, you begin to see that problems can, uh, in families can be defined as being stuck at one stage of family life when they need to go to the next one. You can get, you get the, for example, you get marriage, where the young couple are, is courting. And then it gets more serious as they, as they get engaged. Now they used to. I'm not sure they do anymore. And, uh, then they get more committed to each other when they're married. And then they have a, a child, and they're really committed to the responsibility of the child. So, they get into a stage of childbirth following their marriage. And the childbirth situation, uh, produces a very upset husband often. You know something, the anthropologists have a word, it's cavat(ph) for the strange behavior of husbands when wives are giving birth. We, we take cartoons of them in the waiting rooms and so on. But, there's also many situations where, uh, the husband just takes off while the wife gives birth, and she's unhappy cuz he doesn't stay with her at that time. And they can make them bitter and unhappy for years to come and has to be handled. But, anyhow, one way to think of it is they go from that stage to the, uh, to the next one, the stage of being married to the stage of being parents with that responsibility. At any rate, if you begin to think that way, it's obvious there's about six stages of family life. 

00:44:40
Six Stages of Family Life 

00:44:40
JAY HALEY There's marriage, and there's birth of a child, which is serious. And, uh, there's kids starting school, leaving home for the first time. And there's, kids, uh, preparing themselves to leave home. Then the serious problems when young people leave home, and the parents are stuck only with each other. And, uh, then there's old age, where one or both retires and they both struggle with each other. It's interesting that to work with older people now that we have to do. Therapists have to learn, because, uh, for example, we had a couple come in who had been married 64 years. And they came in with marital problems, so those of you that think those go away in time, just leave them alone, maybe they won't. But, at any rate, that's another theory. There's another one too that's come up in your generation. Therapy was always voluntary. People even said he couldn't go into therapy unless he admitted he was unable to solve his problem or whatever. But, uh, compulsory therapy has come along. 

00:46:05
Compulsory Therapy "Nobody wants to be there" 

00:46:05
JAY HALEY And compulsory therapy is when the, with all the abuses there are, sex and child abuse and violence and all this. Apparently the courts have decided they can't do anything about that, but maybe the therapist can. So, they pass them along. And you get a person who beats his wife, who has a choice of going into therapy or going to jail. And some of them take therapy. And then the put them in a group. Groups are always very popular for abuse. And, uh, that is a new therapy. It's not a therapy where, uh, where you have a cooperative client who wants help. I mean, sometimes it turns into that, but when they arrive, that isn't the way it is. They're in, the patient is there not wanting to be there. And the therapist doesn't want to be there with somebody that doesn't want to be there. So, neither one of them wants to be there, and that's contemporary therapy. There's even whole, whole units, whole agencies that are only compulsory therapy. And it's a problem. It, it's a problem of therapists and their ideologist, ideologies meeting court cases and the way the court thinks and operates. In the courts, you need a villain, you need a villain and a victim. They're not interested in systemic theories. They want them simple theories. And it's a problem to, to, when a court person and a therapist meet to discuss a case. Usually only on the telephone if they ever do that. There's not meetings brought together to deal with these problems. But anyhow, what can happen is that you get a better, a bitter therapist. One of the, uh, that happens for example, is there was a young woman dealing with a family with a delinquent boy, who was gonna go up before the judge. And they came into therapy and worked with this young therapist, and she was pleased with their work, and they were pleased with her, and everything was going well. And he got to court and was let off. And the next day, the therapist called the family to come in, and they said they didn't want to come in. They didn't want therapy, that they had no need of it. And she realized she'd been used. That, uh, they had just used the fact that they were all in therapy to get the boy off, and once he was off, that was it. So, it made bitter, a very bitter person. And it isn't good for therapists to be bitter I don't think. It makes them awkward. Every, and there's another problem relevant to this, and that is that everybody has to make their own theory of how to deal with a compulsory case. When you get a person in there who doesn't want to be there. The schools aren't saying this is what you do that I know of anyhow. And you have to figure it out. For example, there was a young man, is a young man I'm sharing. He was in Michigan. And, he was getting a series of kids who were, who had to come in, court ordered, to therapy. And he was supposed to do something with them, and they didn't want to be there. And some of them wouldn't even talk, but they just didn't want to be there. And, uh, so he developed a thing, he's an example of people just developing an idea of their own. What he did was say to the young man, uh, in the next case, "I have to be here with you for twelve sessions. And you have to be here with me for twelve sessions. But, we don't have to talk. If, if you, if you come every session, I'll report to the judge that you came every session. I can't say anything about your improvement, but I can say you cooperated. So, if you'd like to do that, we can do that." The young man said, "Sure." So, he said, "Well, since you have," Jerry said, "Well, since you have to be here, you might as well read a book while you're here." And he gave him a novel, and then Jerry turned around and did his paperwork and typed stuff and so on. And he says it takes about a half an hour before the kid says, "Well, you know, since I have to be here, we could talk about something. Do you know anything about baseball?" And it turns out Jerry's a baseball player. But he says a half an hour will do it. And he had to work this out on his own. Nobody told him how to do this. So, everybody is working. And where it's relevant I think, to think more deeply about the matter is that, uh, the therapist is always the agent of somebody. We used the agent of the individual. We wouldn't even speak to the family on the phone. Then, uh , in the 60's, we were an agent of the families, in helping people with welfare and getting this and getting that and so on. But, we were with the family against the community, really. But, now with compulsory therapy, you're into a different thing. You're an agent of the state, because the state is using therapists to, to, uh, stop people from misbehaving in a way the state doesn't want them to behave. And it's a question of whether you want to be an agent of the state. Every therapist has to decide on that. Some don't even notice it's a problem, they just say it's one more case. Put them in a group. Groups are very big fro abuse. In fact, there's a, there's another world of abuse treatment that, uh, is strange in some ways. Like I'm a supervisor in a case, and found out that, uh, that the woman, she was in for some form of abuse. And, they put her in a group. And, she was told if she went into therapy she could get long term housing. So, she went into therapy with her kids to get long term housing. She had to be there twelve months or something like that. So, we had the curious explanations of why people go into therapy these days. But, that was the first one I saw related to housing, but it was serious. She did it long, she had a number of kids and needed long term housing. And the therapist would help her get that, you know. At any rate, compulsory therapy is a new thing in the world, I think. And, uh, we're still working out theories and ideas and ways of dealing with them. I think you should take a position that there's no substantiated truth that should handicap you in choosing your theory of therapy. Now, maybe there is, but, uh, you should look and see, because a lot of people have lost confidence in theories that have come along. But, they can choose a theory. You can do it. Let, let me give an example. You can have a theory that an adolescent girl threatens suicide to stabilize her parents and bring her parents together. And therefore, you start working with the parents. That doesn't have to be true. I mean, that's a good theory. There's some evidence for it. But, it doesn't have to be true, that theory. If you made it up, it was still all right, because it guides you to do something, and that's what therapy, therapy theory should be. It should be a guidance to get something done, and to, to have some action. To take and, uh, that theory is pretty different. It's one where, uh, you should be careful mixing theories. If you do an insightful therapy, and you do a therapy where, uh, you're explaining to yourself that. that this is a theory that the kid is helping the parents. If you would, if you bring along an interpretation, if you want to help the girl, and you say to the parents, "You know, your daughter is really helping you. She's helping you stabilize your marriage." And you feel that this universal idea is a great idea. But, what can happen is it can cause real trouble, because who wants a marriage so bad that the kid is committing suicide? So, when the parents understand that's what you're saying, they get really upset and when they get upset, the girl escalates. And you can produce the very problem that you want to get rid of. So you have to think twice about insight and how you use it. It's pretty powerful. At any rate, the characteristics of theory, one of them anyway is that you should have a theory that lets you do a whole variety of operations. And, uh, a method won't do anymore. You can't do with the next patient what you did with the last one, because it's just more complicated now. It's, uh, it's a variety of patients you meet today. It used to be you could specialize more than you can now with HMO and all that. You used to be able to just work with the kid or you could just work with the parent or just with eating disorders. But now with the briefer and faster therapy, you have to have a better (inaudible ). You have to have enough clientele to make a living. So, you need, you need to be able to do a variety of operations. You need to work not only with the kid, but with the parents, and, and not just play therapy with the kid. But, uh, you need a lot of operations in your skill bag. There's another thing that you have to have or should have, and that's a positive view of difficult people. If you have a negative view, you can't work with them as well or they can't work with you as well. So, it's better if you have a positive view. It's, uh, it's important in terms of diagnosis, which, uh, with diagnosis like the DSM-4(ph) is not a positive view of anybody. In fact, you wouldn't have a, wouldn't want a friend who could be described in that manual.(ph) It's just not nice person, that's all. It's, it's purposes are not for therapy. They're for other administrative reasons. And, uh, therapists really should produce a diagnostic system of their own. And, uh, they don't do it. We promise we're gonna do it, but it hasn't been done. I mean, doing such obvious things as the behaviorists did. And that if you have a kid, and he won't go to school. You can diagnosis him as a school phobia. 

00:58:00
Choose a Diagnosis for Action 

00:58:00
JAY HALEY What do you do with a school phobia? Nobody knows what to do. If you make it an avoidance phobia or avoidance problem, then there's something you can do. You stop the kid from avoiding going to school. But does he have some action he can follow the diagnosis, and hopefully be a guide in what to do? So that, uh, somebody's gonna come up with a good diagnosis. A diagnostic system that involves a variety of people, and, uh, helps the therapy do something. I think it isn't helpful to have a research theory of diagnosis or for, uh, your theory of operations. It used to be that, uh, that theories had to be substantiated by research, so the focus went on the research rather than on the, on just the therapy. Therapy was a secondary thing compared with the research. Then when therapists began to make money that changed. I think the therapy got more popular and the research less. But, at any rate, the research has to be too complicated for therapists, I think, because you have to take into account everything that's happened. And, uh, that's a lot. 

00:59:25
Ray Birdwhistell Studies of Body Movement 

00:59:25
JAY HALEY Ray Birdwhistell, the body movement man, estimated that two people in a conversation exchange 100,000 bits of information a minute. And if you look at slow motion films of families or diads, you, uh, you believe him, give or take ten or twenty thousand bits. Those, it's a very complicated situation that you're trying to research. Now, the therapist really doesn't have time to, to deal with 100,000 bits of information. If they can get the mother to think this way and the father to do that, they're doing pretty well. It's just not a, not as complicated as research to make it to get the research done. They're two different endeavors, is what I'm saying. You need the theory of why people are how they are, but you also need a theory of change. You have to have an idea when somebody comes in and presents itself. A woman comes in and says she's so anxious she can't even sit down in the room. You need to be able to say, here's what I, to yourself, here's what I think about this. This is what I'll do. And it's, uh, it's hard to get a theory like that. 

01:00:40
Assumptions of the Directive Approach 

01:00:40
JAY HALEY At any rate, the basic, uh, assumption of a more directive approach are that you formulate a problem, you make an intervention, you deal with the consequences of change, and you want a problem that's a solvable problem. I don't think you should have a problem defined as incurable, but that happens. 

01:01:05
Problems are Curable. 

01:01:05
JAY HALEY There's a number of people who will define schizophrenic diagnosis as an incurable person, and then they'll go ahead and treat them. The same with addictions. They're pessimistic. We had a 23 year old woman who had been in therapy a bit, and, uh was a heroin addict. We saw her alone. She started to cry. The therapist said, "What's the matter?" She said, "I'm incurable." And the therapist said, "Well, where did you get that idea?" And she said, "I've been told that in every treatment program I've been in." Now, people are calling her incurable and putting her in a treatment program. 

01:01:45
Referring to Milton H. Erickson, MD 

01:01:45
JAY HALEY Most things you'd like to do, he can do. I don't know if you're familiar with a case where he changed a man, the February man. He, uh, he had a woman come to him who was lonely and had always been lonely. She said her life had been one bit of loneliness. And she was hesitating over having a child because, uh, she didn't think she had a warm enough past to be able to, uh, to take care of a child properly. So, uh, Erickson hypnotized her, took her back to childhood, and had her sitting alone when the man knocked on the door. And she let him in. And he came, he was coming to see her father. And, uh, her father wasn't there, so the man sat and chatted with her, the little girl. And, uh, then went away. And then Erickson brought her forward about two years. And, uh, she was sitting lonely in the living room, and lo, this same man showed up, knocked on the door. And she called him the February man because he came in February. And what he did was play with her and read some books with her, make a pleasant time. And he left, and she felt very pleasant. Then he took her forward again into later on. And he took her forward in life that way, making her past a positive memory, because there was a pleasant something happened every year or so, all the way through her whole past. And she decided she'd have a child, because her past wasn't all that bad. And that's the only case I know of where somebody changed the past. But, I'm sure if there's such a (inaudible ) that you could do it. It's interesting. (inaudible ) hypnosis. It's a, uh , it's important that it's, that the problem also be cast in hierarchical terms. 

01:03:55
View Problems in Hierarchical Terms 

01:03:55
JAY HALEY I think you understand it better if you think organizationally and with hierarchy instead of individually. It's always to true to think that there's a malfunction in the hierarchy when there's a symptom. If somebody has a symptom in the family, there's something wrong with the hierarchy. You need to, uh, take into account the family life cycle, but you also, you need to, there are certain things you have to do. You have to choose, or they choose you And one of them is the unit to thinking. 

01:04:45
Choosing a Unit 

01:04:45
JAY HALEY You need to think, if you see a client, and, uh, they have a problem. Say it's a woman who's feeling anxious, that she can't even sit down in the room. You have choices that you have to make. You can choose a unit of one as your theory and say she's anxious because of something in the past or something in the, in the thought process. And you use her, one person, as the unit you're thinking, and you can find all kinds of explanations for her problems and individual therapy ideology. Or you can think in a unit of two, which is a different matter all together. You can think this woman has a husband who comes apart if she is very confident. Therefore, she's protecting him by having anxiety attacks, and he takes care of her. But, that's a good a theory as any. That's a two person theory. It's not one. There's, I'll deal later with some two person theories in marriage. And, uh, it's very important to decide the right unit, because you can also have a three person theory. 

01:06:10
3 Person Unit Coalition Theory 

01:06:10
JAY HALEY You can say the woman is anxious because her mother is opposing her husband, and she's caught between mother and husband, and it's making her anxious. And that's a three person theory. It's a coalition theory. The nice thing about coalition theory is it gives you more variety of things to do, of ways to think. And it's more human in that sense. But, at any rate, you have to choose, by the very way you describe the woman, you're choosing the unit. And it's important that you choose the right one. One of the things that's most important besides the unit is the motivation given. Because you can make any motivation that you want useful. I don't think the theory of repression is a good theory of motivation. It, uh, it's very negative, and it's, the goal is to explore the past, which was miserable. 

01:07:20
Theory of Motivation 

01:07:20
JAY HALEY But, the theory of motivation that there's something positive, is a different order of things that you, uh, you can think about it as people helping each other. And that helps you be more present in the (inaudible). 

01:07:40
Choose a Positive Theory of Motivation 

01:07:40
JAY HALEY That is, if you see a kid misbehaving and assume that his motivation is to help his parents, you like the kid more. And it's good that you like the kid when you're gonna deal with him. But a positive motivation is very helpful in giving you ideas of what can be done. One of the , uh, one of the choices you have among these is, is just the idea that people harm themselves to help others. And if you get a wife, as I'll deal with some later, who comes in with her husband. Her motivation may look like she's angry at her husband, but she's trying to help him. She's trying to make him, make my husband a man, and, uh, helping him is her goal when she's attacking him. And what she observes is that when she attacks him, he comes out of whatever state he's in. He's more positive and aggressive and knows something's happening, and so on. And she's had, done her job. She's got her husband on her, on his feet. If you just see her as a unit, you think this is a nasty woman. And she's mean, picking on her poor husband. And you're forced into a coalition because you're not thinking in terms of coalitions. At any rate, what else? I think it's important to, to take into account colleagues, and, uh, what they do or don't do, particularly when you're dealing with court ordered cases. But anyhow, you have to decide on a, on a variety of things if you're going to make your own therapy theory. It was easier when your teacher provided all those rules. It's a different situation now. I think you have to decide whether awareness is a cause of change. If you make somebody aware of, of why they behave as they do, is that a cause of change or is that just a discussion? Because we don't' have such good theories of change and how people should behave to, to fit them. It's a, another decision you have to make is how personally to be involved with your client. I know a woman who went on a diet with her patient. Now is that proper or is that not proper? When you have rules for a method, then it's not a problem. But, when you don't have rules, you've got to make your own. And you have to decide. Would you go on a diet with this woman if that was what would bring her weight down, which is important to her? At any rate, uh, a different decision you have to make is whether to give directives or not. There's two schools of this at least two orientations. One is that, uh, you can't not give directives. 

01:11:10
You Cannot NOT Give a Directive 

01:11:10
JAY HALEY And the other is that you should give directives or not. That is, if you think about how you not give directives in a communication era, it's a, it's a difficult problem. What you have is something like Carl Rodgers(ph) just reflecting back and not directing anybody at all and objecting to direction. But, if you want some work or watch this film, what you see is he doesn't reflect everything back. He reflects certain things back. And you begin to see the patient talk about those certain things more than the other certain things, because you can't not guide somebody if you're interchanging with them at all. And, it's just, uh, necessary. We, uh, we give a directive if we say I don't want you to ask me for any directives. I mean, that's a directive, right? It's very impossible not to, not to direct people. But, this misunderstanding is about you don't direct people in order to follow the directive necessarily. I mean, there are times that's. What you do is you direct people in order to have something for them to talk about that isn't the past or the misery or whatever. Let me give you an example of the master, Erickson. He had a woman come to him with her son, who was a 50, 50 year old son, who was hanging on her all the time. She said she couldn't get away from him. She couldn't even read a book because he, her son, 50 years old hung on her. Erickson didn't explore the dependency of the guy or take the history of the guy or deal with the meaning of it all at all. What he did was say, uh, to the woman, "I want you to take your son out in the desert and push him out of the car." 

01:13:25
Milton H. Erickson, MD Case Example of Giving a Directive 

01:13:25
JAY HALEY And then, when he's out of the car. And you're stronger than he is. I can see that. So, you push him out of the car, and then you drive for one mile, and you park your car. You sit in that air conditioned car and read a book. And your son will have to walk in that hot sun for a mile. But, it's good exercise. He needs exercise. So the woman thought this was a very good idea. And the son didn't' think this was a very good idea. But, the woman drove him out. He was so attached to her, he couldn't get away from her, so he had to go with her. And she drove him out into the desert and pushed him out and drove on and read her book. And, uh, they did this, I think it was three times and then came back in. The mother was pleased. And, uh, the son said, uh, "Isn't there some other exercise I could do besides walking in the hot desert?" And, uh, what he said was, Erickson said, "What do you have in mind?" Left it on him to choose another exercise instead of providing. That is you start telling people what to do and then you back off while they decide what to do. So, at any rate, he said, "What do you have in mind?" The young man, 50 years old, said, uh, "Why don't we go to the bowling alley, and I'll practice bowling while mother sits up in the stands. And, uh, then she can read her book up there. And I'll get exercise." And Erickson said, "I think that's fine." And then he gave a series of tasks like that. And each time what they talked about was how they did, and what the son did, and what the mother did and so on. So that the, it gave them something to talk about, the, the reaction to the task, which was one of the main reasons for doing tasks. It's interesting how often that's not really understood. Your main problem is getting training in giving directives, how to motivate a person, how to tell them what to do, what to do if they don't do it. I'll go over the types of directives in a bit. There's, uh, there's two, let me just list, there's two kinds of directives. 

01:16:05
Straightforward Directives Indirect Directives 

01:16:05
JAY HALEY There's one kind that is straight forward, where you just tell people what to do, and they'll do it hopefully. If you do it right. The other is that you tell them more indirectly what to do, because you can't get them to do it straightforward. That is, if a man comes in and says, "I've been beating my wife and drinking too much." Erickson would say, "Stop beating your wife and stop drinking so much." Actually, Erickson wouldn't, wouldn't say that. But, the therapist can say , "Stop beating your wife and stop drinking so much." And, uh, if the guy comes in and he's stopped beating his wife and isn't drinking so much, you've got it made. I mean, what more can you ask? But if he comes back and says, uh, "Well, I've been beating my wife even more this week, and I drank more than I have." Then you know a straight forward directive isn't going to work with this guy, so you go more indirectly with paradox and metaphor and something like that. But, let me go over the, the, uh, the straightforward ones and the indirect ones after we have a break. Let's take a fifteen minute break.
