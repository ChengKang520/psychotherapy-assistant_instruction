ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Hello, I'm Dr. Robert Schwartz and I'm very pleased to talk to you today about the History, Structure and General Use of the DSM-5. I'm a professor at the University of Akron in the school of counseling in the College of Health Professions. And I have taught, supervised and researched diagnosis of mental disorders over the past 20 years and have seen amazing advances in the area, but also increasing difficulties in how complex and… and how overlapping and… and challenging it is to make accurate evidence based diagnosis . And that's what we're gonna focus on today. So, first of all, when you think about mental disorders and the DSM, which really has become the bible, of the field, it's… it's unequivocally something that needs to be used by virtually every single mental health practitioner, and increasingly medical professionals, nurses, physicians. One thing that people often don't consider when they consider diagnosis and the DSM is, what is a mental disorder in the first place? So, consider for yourself, as a mental health professional, as a healthcare professional, what a mental disorder is in the first place. Think about when you're working with a client, coming in to you, for assistance to the helping professional, what is disordered? People often don't consider that and they jump right into thinking about, how can I diagnose this person? And label their condition with something that the DSM says is mandatory to do. But in fact, we must consider for that human being, in their culture, at this point in time, what is disordered. So, if you think about the word itself, it is literally a lack of order in the mind. So, what is a lack of order in the mind? Well, that's very subjective, isn't it? And what it comes down to when you're thinking about diagnosis and the DSM, is inter-subjectivity between… two human beings, each of whom have a certain lens that they're viewing the world by, not an easy question. And the truth is people have been diagnosed with mental disorders throughout history. You think about Abraham Lincoln way back when was who was diagnosed with what was called Melancholia, at that time, probably clinical depression, today. Famous people like Princess Diana and Elton John had eating disorders. And David Beckham had obsessive compulsive disorder. More recent examples, the tragic events of Philip Seymour Hoffman, dying from an overdose, a substance related disorder. Robin Williams, recently passing away from suicide. And almost, most recent of all, Bruce Jenner, coming out as a transgender. He explained recently in multiple interviews, how he's been struggling with what now the DSM-5 calls gender dysphoria for his entire life. So, these disorders "are common" in everyday life and they're equal opportunity afflictions. It can affect everybody, but we have to decide as mental health professionals, what a disorder is, in the first place. Now one thing that we do know for sure is how disabling they can be. The World Health Organization has finally come out and published guidelines showing, how mental disorders, even though they may be different, cross-culturally, affect every aspect of a person's life. And so for that reason the World Health Organization also explains that, in order to fully be healthy, someone has to be mentally healthy as well. And I'm sure that you would probably agree. If someone is only physically healthy, but suffering deeply from crippling depression or anxiety or unable to work or to love because of psychotic symptoms that impair their ability to relate to others, day-to-day, these are… are… are afflictions that would cause someone not to be healthy in life. And so, it's very important that we see mental disorders as part of the whole being of the person, that can be very, very disabling and crippling. Luckily, we do have decades and decades of research showing that our psycho-social interventions, counseling, social work, marriage and family therapy, and many biological interventions, psychotropic medications can have a huge affect on reducing and some ways even eliminating many mental disorders. The key though to first being able to treat a mental disorder is identifying it. And the sooner we can do that, the better, for prevention or early intervention purposes. And, luckily, we are able to identify these conditions that's what we called diagnosis . And the DSM, at this point in time, DSM-5, is one of the main ways to do that. But, strikingly, and most people don't know this, not the only way. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later on. I'll bet that you didn't know how common mental disorders are? Did you know that the lifetime prevalence rate of a mental disorder in America is 46%, you know what that means? Almost half, almost one out of two Americans will develop a mental disorder at some point in their lifetime. That's astounding, isn't it? Almost 50% of us. And today, the incidents rate or the rate of people this year alone having a mental disorder in America is 25%, one out of four people. Which country in the world, according to World Health Organization statistics, has the highest rate of mental disorders, the good old U.S.A. Not a statistic that we're happy to be number one in, but yet it's the fact. And, unfortunately, the World Health Organization predicts that mental disorder lifetime prevalence rates will continue to increase over the next decade, and possibly reach 50% higher proportions. So, if you think about that, currently, almost half of Americans will develop a mental disorder at some point and in the next decade that goes up 50%. It could reach up to three quarters of our general population, that seems like an epidemic, doesn't it? A health crisis. What do you think might cause this drastic lifetime prevalence rate of mental disorders and the potential for them to increase still over time? And the fact that America has the highest prevalence rate in the world, well, there's a lots of different factors. And one of them has to do with the profession. Mental disorders have been marketed very, very widely and frankly very well, whether it's through drive commercials or whether it's through the American Psychiatric Association, who publishes DSM-5 or whether it's through all of the over 600,000 mental health practitioners working today in America. It helps to reduce stigma in a lot of ways, to make mental disorders known, and hopefully more accepted, and allows more people to come into treatment. But it also drastically opens the doors to these increasing prevalence rates, because there is a business part to our profession, just like there is in any business. So part of the reason that these go up is because of the growth of the profession itself and the marketing of what we call mental disorders. But there are many other reasons too and part of it has to do with changes in our culture. If you think about American society over the last 30, 40, 50 years, what are some of the things that have changed that might affect our mental stability that could inadvertently lead to disordered mental status? Well, increasingly competitive society, stress, increase in crime, increase in global terror, abstract threat, less connection with family and friends, more multitasking or splitting of the brain, which frankly we're not evolved well to do, so it's… it's a low grade fighter flight response in the background. Many different things that actually make us more vulnerable. So, what we need to do as mental health professional is take this into account and figure out a way to help stop the trend. That's what I think that we not only need to do in practice, but also as advocates. One of the first steps to doing that, is figuring out where diagnosis falls within the counseling process? If you know how the counseling process works, and you could be more efficient with diagnosis , then you'll be much more accurate and you will help reduce unnecessary diagnosis and therefore prevalence rates. So, if we look at this graph, for example, which is a wonderful chart of the entire counseling process and you look on the left axis, which is the level of importance, compared to the bottom axis overtime, or number of sessions, you see that the number one thing that we must take into account is the relationship. That's what one stands for, the therapeutic relationship, the alliance with the client, if you don't have that, then it's very difficult to genuinely conduct any other part of a counseling process. And especially, if you are talking about diagnosis , because someone needs to feel safe as a client to be open with you to self-disclose and to follow the flow of the healing process. So, the relationship is key, but the first intervention that you do as a clinician is number two and this is called the Assessment Process. Assessment is basically gathering information about the person you're trying to serve who we call a client in order to work with them and figure out the best pathway towards healing. It's information gathering as a starting point. So this starts at the very, very beginning of a first counseling session and it takes on utmost importance until you gather enough information for number three, which is diagnosis . And as you can see, diagnosis is a very, very early in the counseling process and it often guides the rest of the stages. It's important to insurance companies, it's important for liability purposes and it's also important clinically if it's done well. So, once you reach a diagnosis , which can change anytime, but you have a preliminary diagnosis , that helps lead to number four, which is a treatment plan. Treatment plans do not have to always directly and only linked to a diagnosis , but they should relate to the primary symptoms that a person comes in with. So, it follows this thread of the treatment process. The treatment plan number four leads to number five, the interventions. And then finally number six, termination. As you notice, number two, the assessment process is the only one that never goes down to nothing. And I can remember my first supervisor ever in my master's program, too long ago, that I won't name. So, I don't date myself. And she told me, the one thing you must always remember, if you want to be in an effective clinician is assess, assess, assess. You never stop assessing and that's why this never goes down to nothing. Because even when we speak about a DSM diagnosis , do client's symptoms change, we hope so, we hope for the better that it may change for the worse, but as sym… syndromes collections of science and symptoms change, we always have to be attuned to that, so we can adjust the diagnosis anytime and accurately reflect somebody suffering, in addition to the many other ways that assessment is important. So, think of diagnosis and the DSM specifically, as part of a broader process. And if you know this process and it becomes part of you, you could be much more efficient and also more effective with diagnosis . Now diagnosis has a long, long history, but even more of a long history is abnormal psychology, where all of this comes from. So, psychodiagnosis or diagnosis of mental conditions comes from this sub-field of psychology called abnormal psychology, which like the question I asked about what is a mental disorder, leads to the same question, what is abnormal? Because that's where it comes from. And to know what abnormal is, think about what normal is. I love this title of a book chapter there, it's normal to be abnormal. So, how do you even know if someone is detectably sane or normal? There is really no answer, is that, it's all in the eye of the beholder. But, that's where diagnosis comes from, is figuring out what is not normal or abnormal, and then figuring out how do I pinpoint that and identify it with a name, that's really all diagnosis is. And that is the focus of that normal psychology, not treatment, but how to assess, how to find the ideology or the causes of these conditions, and then understanding the consequence of them. Our perceptions of what is abnormal or mentally disordered has changed drastically over the decades. The further back you go, there used to be more and more of a struggle between seeing mental illness as punishment from the Gods, something supernatural, versus something scientific and there was a lot of conflict there, overtime, umm… way back, when, what you might call the ancient world people used to literally think that mental illness was caused by demonic possession and they would do… a not so pleasant intervention called trephination where they actually drilled a hole in the skull to allow the evil spirit to escape. And then, overtime, literally centuries, when we start to understand biology, anatomy, umm… we start to have a sympathetic attitude towards people with mental disorders. During the enlightenment and the reform movement of the late 1700s and 1800s, we started to have a more sympathetic response to people who are suffering versus viewing them as only deviant and outcasts. Today, we have finally gotten to a point where we view mental disorders from the bio-psycho-social lens, and in my opinion, this is probably the most effective way to think of people who are suffering from emotional psychological behavioral conditions. Because and this is an important point, every single mental disorder described in the DSM has biological, psychological and social causes, and biological, psychological and social consequences. It really is just a matter of how much a certain condition is weighted on each of the three. For example, there might be some conditions like schizophrenia, that might be weighted a little bit more on the biological end, but we do know that environmental conditions, something called high expressed emotion, critical argumentative judgmental overbearing kinds of behaviors from caretakers could bring on symptoms of schizophrenia more quickly and exacerbate them in a more severe way, that's just one example. Then you have some conditions in the DSM, for example, adjustment disorder, that are very, very heavily weighted on the psychological and social aspect. Because they are directly caused by stressor in the person's environment, that they are having difficulty coping with. So, it's important to think as a clinician always about what biological, psychological and social factors are part of the picture for any mental disorder in the DSM. And the reason I say that is because increasingly, over the last decade, there has been more and more of a focus on solely biological factors. And that leads to a certain kind of an intervention, which is psychotropic medications. I am not against psychotropic medications. I think that psychiatric drugs can be helpful for some people at some time. But be aware that today 20% of Americans are prescribed the psychotropic medication, one out of five. 10% of Americans are prescribed an anti-depressant alone today in America, one out of 10 people. So again, this becomes a lens that you look through and the more holistic your lens is, the better you'll be able to understand and help your clients.

ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Specifically talking about DSM, and the different systems that I mentioned previously, most people aren't aware that DSM, today DSM-5 is not the only system of diagnosis in America or in the world. Most people think, because they've learned that DSM is the bible of diagnosis that it's the one and only thing that not only can be used, but must be. In fact, that's incorrect. There is another system called ICD, which stands for the International Classification of Diseases. The ICD, International, as the title says, was developed by the World Health Organization, this is a branch of the United Nations. And it is the official guide of diagnosis in the world. Not only for specifically mental disorders, but for any healthcare condition, no matter what it is. And though international treaty from all 193 member nations of the United Nations, we must use the ICD, the International Classification of Diseases, for what's called mortality statistics or to document the causes of death, mortality. But, with current conditions that someone is suffering from, which is called morbidity, the World Health Organization allows certain countries, because they've petitioned for this to modify the international version of that ICD and America is one of those countries. We have, uh… in 1977, when the 9th version of that international system came out, we got approval from the World Health Organization to modify it for our country, for our culture and our modified version is called the ICD-CM or International Classification of Diseases - Clinical Modification. ICD-CM, that's the American version of the official diagnosis system that all healthcare professionals are required to use by law, and most people don't know that. Some other countries also have another modified version, for example, Canada has the ICD-CA, Thailand has the ICD-TH. There's a handful of them. But the ICD-CM is the one that we must use. And this is the one that evolves overtime and look when it started, in 1898, way, way, way, before the first DSM was published in 1952. The other trend you should notice on here is that, overtime, there's an ICD, another ICD and then an evolution of DSMs overtime, but in every single one, the number of disorders keeps increasing, just from the first to the second version of the DSM, it almost went up a 100% in number of disorders. Then in the third edition of the DSM, it continued to go up and then by DSM-4, there was a diagnosis for every day of the week, or sorry, every day of the year. Unbelievable, isn't it? And so today, we're on the DSM-5 which created an entirely new structure with 20 different chapters of mental disorders, not including non-disorder conditions which we call V-codes or a Z-codes or T-codes or G-codes, these are life concerns, not mental disorders, so to speak. The takeaway here is that both the ICD and the ICD-CM in America and the DSM have evolved over decades and decades and the trend has been increasing numbers of mental disorders and a different way of thinking about them. Because as cultures change, the criteria for diagnosing, what we call disorder, changes as well. 

00:26:40

00:26:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Whether it's the ICD-CM that we must use according to federal HIPAA law or whether it's the DSM, these are categorical systems, you either have a disorder or you don't. And so, you are charged, as a mental health professional, with making a diagnosis. That's the way that it works. So, ultimately when you make that diagnosis, it's tricky, but almost a pull for people to start thinking about the client that has the diagnosis as that diagnosis, that means, identifying the disorder with the person. And that's something we really don't want to do, but way, way too often, you probably have heard people say, they are a schizophrenic, or they are a borderline. Oh, sure, they did that because they're bipolar, and almost writing the person off as it's who they are. And so what that ends up doing, is it creates stigma from the environment, but it also creates self-stigma for the person. It affects their self-concept, their self-esteem and actually could hinder the very things that we're trying to promote for their own mental health. So, what we're really doing with these systems is we're simply labeling a type of suffering that the person has at that time, that's it, these are names that we create, in our culture, at this point in our history, and we're simply labeling that with the certain name, we're not saying that the person is bipolar, they are someone who might be a husband or a wife or a partner, they might be a son or a daughter, they might be a co-worker, they might be a friend, but at this point, they're also suffering from major depressive disorder. It's a different way of thinking about a person as a helping professional. The reason why we have DSM, because you might be asking that question. If ICD is used internationally and ICD-CM, the American version is required here by HIPAA law, well, then why do we even have a DSM? I'm glad you asked. The reason is because even though the ICD-CM is created by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Department of Health and Human Services, they only created the list of codes and names, they didn't develop criteria to diagnose them by, strange, isn't it? They told us which conditions of the international version they are willing to accept and which names to call them by, so we can submit them for billing and track prevalence rates and things. But they didn't actually tell us how to do the diagnosis, that's where the American Psychiatric Association came into the picture. They jumped on the opportunity to be the organization that actually creates the criteria from making the diagnosis. And since 1952, with the first DSM, they have had exclusive rights through their own marketing and lobbying and things like that, to have a monopoly on how we make these diagnosis. Something, isn't it? It could have been the American Psychological Association, it could have been the National Association of Social Workers or American Association of Marriage and Family Therapists or American Counseling Association, but psychiatry did very well to corner the market and since then they have been the exclusive provider of criteria to diagnose what the federal government says we have to log for morbidity or current conditions of illness. Yes. And they've have gone through this evolution of multiple versions and that is where we are today. So, ultimately, it's important to realize there is a long history of abnormal psychology and how we think about what is normal and what is not. There is a long history of international efforts to identify mental illnesses and other forms of illnesses, physical as well. But the American Psychiatric Association is actually the one that publishes criteria to figure out which diagnosis you must submit, for billing or tracking purposes. 

00:32:05

00:32:10
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ So right now, I would love to open it up for discussion and questions. And we can continue discussing the History, Structure and General Use of DSM-5. Please. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Could you help us understand more about how the structure, the DSM relates to the structure of the ICD coding? 

00:32:30
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Sure, that's a great question. Because this is very complex having three different systems. And they link to one another almost as sister systems, but there are some important differences between the three. So the overarching umbrella system is the ICD. The international version published by the World Health Organization and that system is free and available to anyone online. And that includes not only diagnosis codes and names, but full criteria for making the diagnosis. And virtually all countries use that ICD, that WHO international version for making healthcare diagnosis. Our version, the ICD-CM, in America, modified that and took out some of the international diagnosis that we didn't think apply to American culture. And we changed the name of some other ones, for example, have you ever heard of something called hyperkinetic disorder? Probably not. That is in the ICD 9th version, we in America call it ADHD. Hyperkinetic disorder, we call it Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder, that is an American government Centers for Disease Control and Prevention change in the name of a disorder. And, uh… like I said, some disorders were taken out, because the U.S. Government didn't feel like they applied in our culture. So, you have the two levels there that are maybe in my opinion 75% to 80% compatible, but there are some differences there. Now when the American Government changed or modified the version to come up with the ICD-CM, they dropped all of the international criteria, that's where the… the glitch came in and then DSM came in or American Psychiatric Association came in to fill the void. So, they create a criteria for the ICD-CM codes and names, but in the process, just like the American Government deleted some international names and codes and changed some others, so did the American Psychiatric Association. So, there are some DSM disorders, that are nowhere to be found in the ICD-CM. For example, a brand new one that just came out in DSM-5, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, DMDD in children, you will not find it in the ICD-CM, if you were to look up the code that's in the DSM for DMDD, the code is actually for, I believe, other depressive disorder, some broad ICD-CM category, because it's… no, the government never created that, the APA did for DSM. So, there is incongruence even between the government's official version and the DSM-5 version. So it… it makes it very complex and it makes it hard to follow. The way I describe this, since we really in America only need to focus on the ICD-CM and DSM, since we don't use the international version, is clinicians need to become diagnostically bilingual, because if you only use the DSM, you will be diagnosing some things that are not in the ICD-CM at all, and diagnosing other conditions that you weren't aware of, plus, there are many more in the ICD-CM that aren't even in the DSM, 'cause they took some out, they took some out, that they didn't think were relevant. So you must become bilingual and they're compatible again about 75% to 80%. So, for example, if you were to think of languages, bilingualism, English and Spanish is one example. Many people who only speak English would know what hola means, Hello, in Spanish. Or even Buenos dias, good day, because there are some comparability in the language there, and it's the same alphabet. That's how I think of it with DSM and ICD-CM. You have to be bilingual and learn to speak two related, but somewhat different languages. So, you will have to learn the diagnosis and criteria from the DSM, but then go cross-check with ICD-CM. And there is actually an official word for it, it's called cross-walking, crosswalk between the DSM and the ICD. So, when you actually make that diagnosis and send it for billing or record keeping or what have you, it's the official ICD-CM code that you actually want. Thank you for your question. Are there any others? 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN I had a question. You previously spoke about the importance of diagnosis, but also the importance of not making the diagnosis the person. Could you explain that a little further? 

00:38:30
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ I'd be happy to. It's very, very common when clinicians get in a diagnosis mode, because we do it all the time through our career and it becomes almost an automatic pattern for us, that we start inadvertently getting in a mode of just find with the diagnosis, find the diagnosis. And then what happens is, unconsciously it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to us, where the person becomes the disorder that we're actually trying to treat, and more accurately, work with them to recover from. It's a different mindset. So, what I would encourage all mental health professionals to, to consider is not diagnosing a person and then trying to cure the symptoms, rather, I would say we should be labeling a certain kind of human suffering and then working with the persons, so they learn how to recover from it. That's a different mindset and it's a different way of working professionally. You know, I'm fortunate in Akron, Ohio, to have a local star and his name is Fred Frese. And if you want to learn more about him, his struggles and his advocacy for mental health versus mental illness, just go to fredfrese.com. Fred Frese has been living with schizophrenia for most of his life, he is a psychologist and he just recently won the world… the mental health America, Person of The Year award, for his advocacy on focusing on mental health and recovery and a person centered approach versus a medical model fix and illness approach. He is almost, if you remember, John Nash who was portrayed in Beautiful Mind by Russell Crowe, he is almost a living example of a John Nash in the mental health community. Wonderful person and he says, our goal, as mental health professionals, should be to eliminate the N word from our field, not's, that's what he is advocating for and that's what we should do, the first way we should do that is by not seeing people as a disorders, but seeing them as suffering human beings who come to us for support, for collaboration, so they can recover and have a happier, more fulfilled, more productive life. Any last questions. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN I have a question. Earlier, you mentioned the biopsychosocial model in the DSM. I was wondering if you could expand on that? 

00:41:35
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Sure. Part of seeing people not as their diagnosis, but as suffering human beings, is seeing them holistically. This is, very, very important for all of us, because we are all biology, 24/7, we're all psychology, thinking, we're all feeling, emoting, beings and we use all of that information to tell us about the world, and to tell us how to live more effectively, how to evolve, how to adapt? And so, because we are an integrated system and you can add spirituality to that as well depending on the client and how important and… and meaningful that is in their life, we are one holistic being and suffering affects all parts of that system our biology, our psychology, our emotional life and possibly our spiritual life as well. So, when you assess a client going back to the counseling process graphic, it's vital to access the physical, physiological health part of someone suffering when they have what we call a mental disorder, in addition to what are they thinking and how it is affecting their outlook and their self-esteem and self-concept and then what are they feeling, whether it's anxiety or depression or what have you. And then, perhaps, how is it affecting their view of meaning or purpose in life or spirituality. The… The take away is to see the person as a complex interrelated being and talk through all aspects of that with them. And then you will come up with a more comprehensive picture of how to work with them to meet their own goals towards recovery. All right. Thank you very much for your enlightening questions and for helping me share with you the history, the structure and the general use of DSM-5.
