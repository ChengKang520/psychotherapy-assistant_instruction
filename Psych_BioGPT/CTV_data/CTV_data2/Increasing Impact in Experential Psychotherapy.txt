Jeffrey Zeig, PhD 

00:00:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, well, welcome to all of you. This is a, uh, clinical demonstration. We've been talking to people in the audience and trying to find out about something that we could work with within the limited time that we have and demonstrate some techniques of Ericksonian psychotherapy. Basically what we're doing is we are thinking about using techniques that are more akin to drama and more akin to art than they are to science. So, rather than being a psycho-educational approach, this is an approach that is intensely experiential, trying to distill that down to its most pristine form. Music. Uh-huh. Uh, exactly. So music moves us. And music makes us feel things. And music is the most abstract of all arts. And music takes off where language ends, and it adds a dimension to human experience that language cannot possibly add, and it explores a territory that is endemic to language but is only -- is limited by some functions of language. Thought: Communication is composed of two elements: the informative element and the expressive element. And we spend time in the informative element especially when we're trying to learn about physics, when we're trying to learn about mathematics, we need information in order to survive in the world. But there's the expressive aspect of language, and this is demonstrated in music. For example, music has no information; it's an abstract art. Yet music moves our emotions. And if you watch a movie and there's no music, you don't feel it. And we need to feel things, and so music turns out to be the verb that makes the drama happen on an emotional level. So what I've been doing lately is I've been interviewing artists of all ilks, artists from composers to film directors, to comic-book writers, and I've been trying to understand about the expressive aspects of communication, so that we can apply those expressive aspects into the warp and woof of psychotherapy and make psychotherapy based on the experiences that you live, which is similar to what happened when I was with Milton Erickson, that he was giving me experiences and these were more in the expressive realm, and then I would change and grow and develop by virtue of the experiences I lived, rather than the information that I received. And I could say, trying to characterize Erickson in a very simple sentence, that he was about expressive communication; he explored channels of expressive communication that previously had only been explored by artists of all ilks, and he applied those into psychotherapy. But he wasn't really cognizant of the fact that he was modeling artists, he was modeling people, and understood that people's emotion states were moved more by things that were expressive than were moved by things that were informative. If you want to laugh, I can't say to you 'This is a good time to laugh.' I'd have to tell you a joke that would elicit a change in your state by using some expressive techniques. So I hope we get to demonstrate some of those things. We've had a few people who have been kind enough to volunteer, and there are some interesting, um, issues that we can work with. But one professor here talked about her concern about the end of the semester, and anxiety and performance. And so let's invite her to come on stage and, uh, work with me on this anxiety seemingly related issue.

00:05:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG We're going to have to hook you up with a microphone. 

00:05:10
DELLA Okay. 

00:05:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And hi, you're? 

00:05:10
DELLA Della. 

00:05:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Della. 

00:05:10
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Nice to meet you. 

00:05:10
DELLA Nice to meet you. 

00:05:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Please be seated. And we need somebody to help with the microphone. Are we going to -- there is no microphone. Okay. Well, we can use this one. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:05:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  Okay. 

00:06:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:06:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Della, you come here and there's something that you want to accomplish. 

00:06:20
DELLA Right. 

00:06:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And there's a place that you want to be. 

00:06:25
DELLA Okay. 

00:06:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And here you are now. 

00:06:30
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:06:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And you have in mind someplace that you want to be. So I'd like to understand something about this place that you want to be. Suddenly our therapy, poof, happens and you traverse that distance and you're here. 

00:06:50
DELLA Okay. I'd like to be in a place where I'm relaxed inside. 

00:07:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Relaxed inside? 

00:07:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:07:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Help me to understand. And help me to understand Della -- 

00:07:05
DELLA Okay. 

00:07:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- when you're relaxed inside. I'd like to know the experience of being relaxed inside. 

00:07:15
DELLA Okay. The experience of being relaxed inside, I can feel it in my stomach. 

00:07:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so as you feel your stomach now -- 

00:07:25
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- help me to understand. 

00:07:25
DELLA It feels like -- I'm very much into visual, but it -- it feels like and looks like a prune -- 

00:07:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Um-hum. 

00:07:35
DELLA -- that's all shriveled up. 

00:07:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right now? 

00:07:35
DELLA Right now, and at the end of this semester. 

00:07:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And the end of this semester, because you're a professor -- 

00:07:45
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:07:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- has been difficult for you? 

00:07:45
DELLA Yes. Always. 

00:07:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  Okay. 

00:07:50
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:07:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Always. 

00:07:50
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:07:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And this prune inside, would you help me -- hand the prune to me. 

00:08:00
DELLA Gladly. 

00:08:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great. I have the prune. 

00:08:00
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:08:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And I'm holding it here, and it's -- help me to understand that prune. 

00:08:10
DELLA Okay. It's -- it's shriveled, it's wrinkled. 

00:08:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay -- 

00:08:15
DELLA It's -- 

00:08:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- shriveled and wrinkled. How big is it? 

00:08:15
DELLA It's about that size. 

00:08:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, I've got it. 

00:08:20
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:08:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And it's shriveled and wrinkled. 

00:08:20
DELLA And it's dark. 

00:08:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Dark? 

00:08:25
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:08:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And that prune, light? Heavy? 

00:08:30
DELLA Hmm, it's probably heavy. 

00:08:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Heavy? 

00:08:35
DELLA Heavy. Um-hum. 

00:08:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:08:35
DELLA Yeah. 

00:08:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And any other qualities about that prune? 

00:08:40
DELLA Uh, no. It's just kind of right there in the middle of your hand. 

00:08:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right there in the center? 

00:08:45
DELLA Right in the center. 

00:08:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:08:45
DELLA Kind of by itself. 

00:08:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Can I? 

00:08:50
DELLA No, it probably wouldn't drop. 

00:08:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Wouldn't? 

00:08:55
DELLA No. 

00:08:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:08:55
DELLA No. 

00:08:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG It's here? 

00:08:55
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:08:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So there's something that's sticky -- 

00:09:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:09:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- about that prune? 

00:09:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:09:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And can I somehow appreciate this prune? 

00:09:10
DELLA There are probably some good qualities about the prune. 

00:09:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG What could I -- what could I see here that I could appreciate about it? 

00:09:20
DELLA Um, it's consistent. 

00:09:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Yes? 

00:09:20
DELLA It's -- it kind of pushes me to be better -- 

00:09:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:09:30
DELLA -- at what I do. 

00:09:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. So, consistent, pushes you. So "pushes you" means that there's some kind of an energy about this prune? 

00:09:40
DELLA Um-hum. Very much. 

00:09:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Now, now that I understand the prune, and now that I can appreciate something about the prune and its consistency, its stickiness even, and something about its energy, and the way that it can guide you -- 

00:09:55
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:09:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and it can guide you to do some things that are really important in your career, I'm going to take the prune -- woops -- and I'm going to put it in my stomach. Is that all right? 

00:10:10
DELLA Um-hum. Yes. 

00:10:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Because I want to know what it would be like to have that prune. 

00:10:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:10:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so I'm going to take the prune. Here? 

00:10:20
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:10:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Here? 

00:10:20
DELLA Right there. 

00:10:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Where? 

00:10:20
DELLA Right here. 

00:10:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Here? Solar plexus? 

00:10:20
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:10:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So I'm going to take the prune and I'm going to put it here. 

00:10:30
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:10:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Superficial? Deep? Where will I place it? 

00:10:30
DELLA Right in the middle of your stomach. 

00:10:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG In the middle of my stomach? 

00:10:35
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:10:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And then I've got that prune; I've got it in the middle of my stomach. And help me to -- to understand. So as I feel it, it's like a heaviness? 

00:10:50
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:10:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh? 

00:10:50
DELLA Heaviness. 

00:10:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And, yes, it's got that quality of stickiness. Uh-huh. And, uh, as I can experience that prune, it would be something that would be hard for me to get out of my mind. 

00:11:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:11:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So I would know that it was there, and it would be there -- and I'm telling you my experience of what it's like; it would be there like an egg. 

00:11:20
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:11:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:11:20
DELLA Right. 

00:11:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Now, what I'd like to do is to just get rid of that prune. 

00:11:30
DELLA Okay. 

00:11:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG But somehow it's sticky and it stays there. And I've got that prune. 

00:11:35
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:11:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. All right. 

00:11:40
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:11:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So I can begin to feel and understand and experience a little bit of what that's like. Okay, so now if we take the prune for a minute and we go and turn that prune upside-down -- 

00:11:50
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:11:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- what is your experience? 

00:11:55
DELLA  It's a plum. 

00:12:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG It's a plum? 

00:12:00
DELLA It's a plum, uh-huh. 

00:12:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:12:00
DELLA And it's -- you know, it's soft and it's big, and there are no wrinkles. 

00:12:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So life is about finding your internal plum? 

00:12:10
DELLA Yes. Is that bad? 

00:12:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG That's good. 

00:12:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:12:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:12:15
DELLA It's just the opposite of a -- of a prune, for me -- 

00:12:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:12:20
DELLA -- in a visual -- 

00:12:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. In a -- in a visual sense. 

00:12:25
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:12:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So where would you locate in your body that internal plum? 

00:12:30
DELLA I'd want it to be in the same place. 

00:12:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG In the same place? 

00:12:35
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:12:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Okay. So let's construct it. 

00:12:40
DELLA Okay. 

00:12:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay? We'll put it here. 

00:12:40
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:12:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And we'll play with it for a minute. 

00:12:45
DELLA Okay. 

00:12:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So help me to construct this internal plum. 

00:12:45
DELLA Okay. It's -- 

00:12:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Now -- 

00:12:50
DELLA It's big. 

00:12:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Big? 

00:12:50
DELLA It kind of -- 

00:12:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:12:50
DELLA -- fills your whole hand. 

00:12:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:12:55
DELLA It's soft and it's got different shades of purple and -- and kind of pinks and -- and it's kind of lustrous, kind of a real shiny, you know, outside and -- and -- and it's just -- it moves like this. 

00:13:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:13:10
DELLA  It's just very -- 

00:13:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Lustrous -- 

00:13:15
DELLA Yes. 

00:13:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and moving? 

00:13:15
DELLA Yes. 

00:13:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Very cool. Okay, here. 

00:13:20
DELLA Okay. 

00:13:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG You've got it? 

00:13:25
DELLA I've got it. 

00:13:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And can you feel the -- the shape and the -- 

00:13:25
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:13:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- movement? 

00:13:30
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:13:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And begin to experience some of the luster? 

00:13:35
DELLA Um-hum. And the pretty colors. 

00:13:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Really pretty colors. 

00:13:35
DELLA Really pretty colors. 

00:13:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG What colors? 

00:13:35
DELLA It's the -- the purples, different shades of purples, and kind of some silvers and a little bit of yellow. Um, but it just kind of -- depending on the way the light hits it, it kind of changes -- 

00:13:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
DELLA -- the colors of that deep purple. 

00:13:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. How lovely. And so then what would you like to do? 

00:14:00
DELLA I'd like it to kind of fill my whole body -- 

00:14:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right, so let's -- 

00:14:05
DELLA -- instead of being right -- fill my whole body. 

00:14:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Let's take it for a moment. And where would you like to bring it inside first? 

00:14:10
DELLA Just here. 

00:14:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, hold it there for a moment. 

00:14:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:14:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then take a deep breath and close your eyes. And realize the gentle support of your hands on your head. And as you can begin to realize that gentle support, there can be something that is luminous about that, and something that is really moving in many, many different senses, so that, Della, you could begin to envision in a way that has a sense to it, a kind of growing felt sense. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And that suddenly as you do that in a way that you couldn't possibly understand consciously, there can be some luminous memories, memories of times when you could really experience yourself moving in ways that were really easy and graceful, and ways that were filled with robust shape and colors; maybe a time when you were a little girl and you were out in the garden, and you're picking fruit off of the trees; maybe a time when you're a little older child, and there's something that you're doing that's really important, and you're doing it with ease and grace. And the more vividly that you can remember, the more that you can sense, sense the embodied realization of that image as it begins to move inside. And as that happens, I'd like you to let your hands begin to move down and find a place in your body where your hands can rest in such a way that your hands can -- yes, that your hands can further support the embodiment of that image -- 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- so that you can feel the gentle support of your hands resting on your abdomen, so that you can recognize the warmth of your hands as they rest on your abdomen, and so that you can begin to experience the support and the gentleness. And the gentleness can be some of the movement as you take that easy breath and just let yourself be absorbed in the experience. And all along, that can be part of the memories of that little girl, in ways that you can't possibly understand consciously. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  And the way in which your hands can stretch and move to further encompass that feeling, so interesting. And then, Della, I'd like you to enjoy that for a moment, hold that for a moment, be with that for a moment, so that then you can begin to reorient yourself and bring yourself back. And I'd like you to reorient yourself and bring yourself back and take one or two or three easy breaths. Just take one or two or three easy breaths and then stretch and bring yourself back here fully alert and wide awake all over. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Hi. 

00:19:25
DELLA Hi. 

00:19:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG What was that like? 

00:19:30
DELLA It was really interesting to start with my head and move down to -- 

00:19:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG How so? 

00:19:35
DELLA Um, because it -- it felt like I -- it needed -- it needed to come here first -- 

00:19:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:19:40
DELLA -- because this is always the comfortable place here -- 

00:19:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:19:50
DELLA -- that I always try and focus on here. But I don't ever focus here. 

00:19:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:19:55
DELLA And so to start here -- 

00:19:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So as you focused here -- 

00:19:55
DELLA As I focused here, it almo -- it was like it was -- 

00:20:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:20:00
DELLA Sorry. -- it was like it was getting the message all the way through my body, which is what I wanted to do. 

00:20:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:20:10
DELLA I don't want it right here. I want it kind of to fill my whole body. 

00:20:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So now, where you have been in this place of having that internal prune -- 

00:20:25
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:20:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:20:25
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:20:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And you'd recognize that internal prune when you would experience what? 

00:20:35
DELLA I would recognize the internal prune when I experience a tightness at this -- in this part of my body -- 

00:20:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:20:45
DELLA -- um, when -- a heaviness inside my body -- 

00:20:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:20:50
DELLA -- at this place -- 

00:20:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:20:50
DELLA -- um, and kind of where it would be -- kind of like it wouldn't move; it would just be right there. 

00:21:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Stuck? 

00:21:00
DELLA Stuck. Um-hum. 

00:21:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Got it. Sticky. Stuck. 

00:21:00
DELLA Sticky. Um-hum, sticky. 

00:21:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. We're going to do -- uh, do something a little different -- 

00:21:05
DELLA Okay. 

00:21:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- if that's all right. 

00:21:05
DELLA Okay. 

00:21:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  What I'm going to do is, uh, ask you again -- 

00:21:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:21:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- take -- give me that internal prune. 

00:21:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:21:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:21:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:21:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Got it. 

00:21:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:21:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. What's it like now? 

00:21:20
DELLA It doesn't have as many wrinkles in it -- 

00:21:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:21:25
DELLA -- now. Um, it doesn't seem so -- I guess it doesn't seem so powerful. Or it doesn't seem like -- it doesn't seem so scary. 

00:21:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And if it's not scary, then what is it? It's less wrinkled and plumper? 

00:21:50
DELLA Um-hum. It's more like a plum. It's -- it's more like a plum. 

00:21:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:21:55
DELLA And it's not so dark. 

00:21:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  How far would we say it's come? It's lighter -- 

00:22:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:22:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- more purple hues, and more variation, can we say? 

00:22:05
DELLA Yeah. 

00:22:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:22:05
DELLA  It's just lighter, so it's -- 

00:22:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh./ 

00:22:10
DELLA -- it's lighter -- 

00:22:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:22:15
DELLA -- so you don't have to hold it so tight. 

00:22:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Okay. Got it. 

00:22:15
DELLA Like that, yeah. 

00:22:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. How far would we say that it's come from its earlier manifestation? 

00:22:25
DELLA I'd say it's come from here to here. 

00:22:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG From here? 

00:22:30
DELLA From here -- 

00:22:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. To here. 

00:22:30
DELLA -- to here. 

00:22:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, fantastic. Beautifully done. Really well done. Let's take your internal prune -- 

00:22:35
DELLA Okay. 

00:22:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- in its newly transformed -- 

00:22:40
DELLA Okay. Okay. 

00:22:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- manifestation. And I'm going to take it and I'm going to put it here behind you. 

00:22:45
DELLA Okay. 

00:22:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Or here. 

00:22:50
DELLA Yeah, I don't want to see it. I like it behind you. 

00:22:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG You like it behind you. 

00:22:50
DELLA Yes. 

00:22:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So I'm going to put it here behind you in its -- 

00:22:55
DELLA Okay. 

00:22:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- transformed form. 

00:22:55
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:22:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then I'm going to ask you to do something a little strange. I'm going to ask you to stand up. 

00:23:00
DELLA Okay. 

00:23:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And then you have to put that in your pocket or -- great. Okay, good. And then what I'd like you to do is to just change your energy just a little bit. Great. And then I want you to come behind yourself -- 

00:23:15
DELLA Okay. 

00:23:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and be that modified morphed internal prune for a minute. 

00:23:25
DELLA Okay. 

00:23:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And Della is sitting there. Uh-huh. 

00:23:25
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:23:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  And then maybe you could take a grip on the back of the chair, if that feels like -- 

00:23:35
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:23:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- an adequate representation of where the -- uh-huh. 

00:23:40
DELLA Right. 

00:23:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And then just close your eyes for a moment and wrinkle yourself and shrivel yourself up a little bit and get sticky for a moment. 

00:23:45
DELLA Um-hum. Okay. 

00:23:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And be that transformed internal prune, and see what it is that you want to do with Della; if you want to -- 

00:24:00
DELLA Okay, I want to -- 

00:24:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:24:05
DELLA -- kind of -- 

00:24:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, keep doing that for a moment. 

00:24:05
DELLA Okay. 

00:24:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then, uh, Internal Prune, as you keep on doing that, exaggerate that movement just a little bit. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then, Internal Prune, what I'd like you to do is to put a sound to that motion. 

00:24:35
DELLA Mmmm. 

00:24:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Mmmm. Uh-huh. Mmmm. Am I adequately -- 

00:24:50
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:24:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Mmm mmm. 

00:24:50
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:24:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Mmm mmm. 

00:24:50
DELLA Mmm mmm. 

00:24:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then I'd like you to allow your face to express some emotion that is further developing that sound and that action. Uh-huh. And there's that gentle smile -- 

00:25:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:25:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and that encompassing movement. 

00:25:20
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:25:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then take it one more step and, now that you've added the gesture and you've exaggerated the gesture and that you've added the sound and added the expression, and just see where that takes you and let that evolve one more step. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  And then help with the sound just a little bit more so that it really enriches the experience. 

00:26:10
DELLA Mmmm. 

00:26:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Mmmm. 

00:26:20
[sil.] 

00:26:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic. Okay, and then stop for a moment and step back just a little bit, and change your energy again. Okay, and come back here. Oh, let me change that for a moment -- 

00:26:45
DELLA Okay. 

00:26:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- just because I'm curious. Go -- go back there for a second. 

00:26:50
DELLA Okay. 

00:26:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And stay where you were. What was your experience being the internal prune in that Mmmm? 

00:27:00
DELLA I felt more in control -- 

00:27:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:27:05
DELLA -- more kind of able to take care of Della. 

00:27:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Take care of. 

00:27:10
DELLA -- and -- and take care of Della and then be more -- take ownership of the prune. 

00:27:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:27:15
DELLA I could kind of decide how far I wanted to nurture -- 

00:27:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Were you the prune? 

00:27:20
DELLA I was the prune. 

00:27:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG You were the prune? 

00:27:20
DELLA I was the prune. 

00:27:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Okay. And you took ownership and took care. 

00:27:25
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:27:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:27:30
DELLA And I could decide -- being the prune, I could decide how much I wanted to nurture Della and how -- 

00:27:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:27:35
DELLA -- and how -- 

00:27:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Beautiful. 

00:27:35
DELLA -- happy I could be -- 

00:27:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:27:40
DELLA -- or how -- 

00:27:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So can you come back here? Change your energy. 

00:27:40
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:27:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Great. And then be Della for a moment. 

00:27:45
DELLA Okay. 

00:27:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And then what I'm going to do is to just, for your enjoyment and -- 

00:27:55
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:27:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- edification -- 

00:27:55
DELLA Okay. 

00:27:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and for your evolution, I want to go back there for a moment, and I'd like to be that prune -- 

00:28:00
DELLA Okay. 

00:28:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- that internal prune -- 

00:28:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:28:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- so that you can have the experience of being Della. And I'll just represent my -- to the best that I can -- 

00:28:10
DELLA Okay. 

00:28:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
DELLA Okay. 

00:28:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- being that internal prune behind you, in its -- um-hum. 

00:28:20
DELLA Open state. Better state. Okay. 

00:28:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Is that okay? 

00:28:20
DELLA That's great. 

00:28:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great. So -- okay, so you get to be Della and -- and there's that internal prune and it signaled you with a little heaviness. And suddenly it's here. 

00:28:35
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:28:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG All right? And there's that -- 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:40
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:28:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- which then gradually became -- 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- which then gradually added Mmm mmm, Mmm mmm, Mmm mmm, which then also added an expression, Mmm mmm, Mmm mmm. And you might want to just close your eyes for a moment so that you can really experience the essence of that Mmm mmm, Mmm mmm. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:29:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And just like as a little girl, you could memorize how to roller-skate, and that how you memorize how to roller-skate, this is something that you don't do with your mind; you just get in your mind the idea 'Oh, yeah, this is something I can do.' And as a little girl, you may be looking around and you may be seeing other people and other children and seeing how they do this task. And in your mind you may be thinking to yourself, 'Well, of course I can do this.' And you may be thinking to yourself, 'Mmm, yeah. This is something that I can do.' And so then you have your equipment, then you have the skates, and you get into your mind this is something that's right and this is the time that's right. And then you realize that gradually and surely, surely and securely, this is something that you realize and encompass; it's a sensation that you nurture in your body. And at first the steps may be a little bit tentative, and yes -- yes, gradually and surely, surely and securely, once you've established the momentum, suddenly there's that moment in which now you're there. And this is something that you don't recognize consciously. This is something you realize this in your body. And suddenly there's that sense 'Well, I've taken care of this' -- 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and that you've nurtured inside the realization -- 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- that you are able to do this and that you can skate just so easily -- 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and move forward that -- with that momentum continuing to nurture inside all of those abilities that help you to continue to move forward. And, Della, I don't know just how you'll begin to realize some of the meaning and import of those words for you, but I'd like you to really do that in your way and in the way that's really right for you. And then I'd like you to once again take the quiet and reflective moment inside and just allow yourself to be inside easily, comfortably, and then begin to bring yourself back here and reorient yourself back, taking one or two or three easy breaths. Take one or two or three easy breaths and then bring yourself back and open your eyes and reorient, fully alert. Hi. 

00:34:50
DELLA Hi. 

00:34:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  How are we doing? 

00:34:55
DELLA That was cool. 

00:34:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Cool? 

00:34:55
DELLA Yes. 

00:34:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG How was it cool? 

00:34:55
DELLA Huh? It was -- it worked. 

00:35:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG It worked? 

00:35:00
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:35:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG What worked? 

00:35:00
DELLA Huh? It was so interesting. It felt like -- first when I was going to put the prune back here, I thought 'Oh, maybe that's not a -- you know, is that the best place for it? Would it feel heavy?' But it really almost felt like the prune became a blanket, and it blanketed me and -- and very comforting, and that it didn't have to be here, it can be over here. And it -- it's -- it's much better over here, because it's much more of a comfort, and it really -- I could really go to that place where it's not here anymore. 

00:35:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And you really went to that place. 

00:35:45
DELLA I really went to that place. 

00:35:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:35:45
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:35:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Very well done. Nice brightness in your eyes, and good color in your cheeks. 

00:35:50
DELLA Uh-huh. And it worked. 

00:35:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:35:55
DELLA I've never done it. 

00:35:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Delightful. 

00:35:55
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:35:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:35:55
DELLA That's great. 

00:35:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Really well done. 

00:35:55
DELLA Thank you. 

00:35:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Very well done. Let's, uh, do a little check and play with it -- 

00:36:00
DELLA Okay. 

00:36:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- one more step. 

00:36:00
DELLA Sure. 

00:36:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay? So, um, you know, in the morning the alarm clock goes off. 

00:36:05
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:36:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right? You need the alarm clock. 

00:36:10
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:36:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG The alarm clock is a kind of energy; it sets up a little vibration. Suddenly the alarm goes off, and what do you do? 

00:36:15
DELLA  Turn it off. Um-hum. 

00:36:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So, now, let's say that there's, uh, that momentary sense of heaviness -- 

00:36:25
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:36:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- that you might feel. 

00:36:25
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:36:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right? And suddenly that you, uh, have recognized it. And then, um, what will you have yourself do? 

00:36:35
DELLA I'll have the prune kept behind me. 

00:36:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:36:40
DELLA I'll know that it's right -- 

00:36:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Yes? 

00:36:45
DELLA The first I'll know, I'll -- 

00:36:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And so you'll -- 

00:36:45
DELLA -- sense that it's here. 

00:36:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh? 

00:36:45
DELLA And then I'm just going to immediately put it back here -- 

00:36:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:36:50
DELLA -- which will make it -- take it from that momentary tightness to a little bit bigger back here. 

00:36:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:36:55
DELLA And then -- 

00:36:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And suddenly it becomes an energy back here. 

00:37:00
DELLA An energy back there ---. 

00:37:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:00
DELLA Okay. -- that -- 

00:37:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right. 

00:37:00
DELLA -- that will just kind of -- 

00:37:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:05
DELLA -- cover. And that's what to me it -- 

00:37:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Like a blanket. 

00:37:10
DELLA Like a blanket. 

00:37:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:10
DELLA And cover it. And -- 

00:37:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And that blanket could have its own sound. 

00:37:15
DELLA Energy. And it's own energy -- 

00:37:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Its own energy. 

00:37:15
DELLA -- and sound and -- 

00:37:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Mmm mmm. 

00:37:15
DELLA And it's a happy -- it's a happy feeling. 

00:37:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:20
DELLA So it's kind of a -- 

00:37:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG A heavy feeling in a good way. 

00:37:20
DELLA Yes. 

00:37:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:20
DELLA A happy -- I mean, it's very kind of -- 

00:37:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Happy feeling. 

00:37:25
DELLA -- happy feeling. 

00:37:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:25
DELLA And so it's -- it's just opposite of what -- 

00:37:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:37:30
DELLA -- was here. 

00:37:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Okay, and so -- 

00:37:35
DELLA And bigger. 

00:37:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And bigger. 

00:37:35
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:37:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So -- 

00:37:35
DELLA It has more power. 

00:37:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So now, right, help me to understand. 

00:37:40
DELLA Okay. 

00:37:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right? Go back inside. See -- 

00:37:40
DELLA Yeah. 

00:37:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- what you can find, as any remnants of that internal prune. 

00:37:45
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:37:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Dig, dig, dig. Where is it now? 

00:37:50
DELLA It's really not as -- it's -- it's more nebulous. It's -- you can't really -- it doesn't have a shape. 

00:38:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:38:00
DELLA It -- it's -- it's kind of -- 

00:38:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:38:05
DELLA -- just in there. It doesn't really have a color. I don't see the wrinkles. I don't -- 

00:38:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:38:10
DELLA I don't -- it -- it's not as -- 

00:38:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:38:15
DELLA -- defined. 

00:38:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So take a look. 

00:38:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:38:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG See it -- 

00:38:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:38:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- as it's become something that's -- doesn't even have a really clear margin -- 

00:38:25
DELLA Unh-unh. 

00:38:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- no clear definition. 

00:38:25
DELLA Unh-unh. 

00:38:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. And no clear color. Kind of transparent. 

00:38:30
DELLA Right. 

00:38:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:38:30
DELLA Right. 

00:38:30

00:38:30
DELLA In a good way. 

00:38:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  Uh-huh. In a really good way. Uh-huh. And so sit back for a moment and see in. How do you like it being here? 

00:38:40
DELLA It's a lot less kind of intrusive the way it is now. 

00:38:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG 'Kay. 

00:38:45
DELLA It's very manageable. 

00:38:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  And it may -- in the right place here? 

00:38:50
DELLA Um-hum. Um-hum. 

00:38:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Here? 

00:38:50
DELLA  Right there. Kind of -- 

00:38:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right there? 

00:38:55
DELLA Yeah. It's -- 

00:38:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:38:55
DELLA -- further away from me. 

00:38:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Further away from you? 

00:39:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:39:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And you've sat back and you can get a -- a good look at that? 

00:39:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:39:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And then, um, help me for a moment. Here, take this. 

00:39:05
DELLA Okay. 

00:39:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Got it? 

00:39:10
DELLA Um-hum. Got it. 

00:39:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Okay, and then bring it inside yourself. Uh-huh. And you want to start here and then move -- 

00:39:15
DELLA Here. 

00:39:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Here. 

00:39:20
DELLA Here's good. Uh-huh 

00:39:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Here's really good? 

00:39:20
DELLA Yeah, here's really good. 

00:39:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great. And then just, uh, take a moment and close your eyes and go inside and think about some of the tasks that you have to do at the end of the semester. 

00:39:30
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:39:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And feel this as you smile in that gentle way, and feel this as an energy, and as an energy that's going to help you and help you to stay focused on what it is that you have in store for yourself -- 

00:40:00
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:40:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and so that you can beam yourself onto the campus, and you can feel yourself with your arms there at your sides and that there's something that's shapeless and formless, and something that's open and something that's transparent, something that's yes, and something that somehow establishes a kind of firm foundation for you to negotiate your way around the campus. Where on the campus are you now? 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:50
DELLA  I'm not on campus. 

00:40:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Where are you now? 

00:40:55
DELLA Huh? Um -- 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:00
DELLA -- I'm not -- just kind of everywhere. 

00:41:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG You're everywhere? 

00:41:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:41:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Nice to just be -- 

00:41:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:41:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- experience. 

00:41:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:41:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  And then allow yourself to continue to negotiate your way. And I would invite you, should that be meaningful or valuable to you, to imagine yourself as if you were beaming yourself forward into your future; perhaps in your office. 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Begin to bring yourself back here and reorient. And bring yourself back here and reorient easily and fully, fully and completely. Reorient by bringing yourself back and taking one or two or three easy breaths. Just take one or two or three easy breaths and reorient and bring yourself back. And then stretch and -- uh-huh. 

00:42:25
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:42:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG What was that like? 

00:42:25
DELLA Um, it was really pleasant. It was really -- yes -- 

00:42:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:42:35
DELLA -- like filling up. It was like -- 

00:42:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:42:35
DELLA -- and -- and letting -- letting go. And I liked the idea of going into the future and taking it with me. I can -- 

00:42:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG How did you envision -- 

00:42:45
DELLA -- picture -- 

00:42:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- how did you picture it? 

00:42:45
DELLA I could picture it -- envision it -- 

00:42:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG As a -- 

00:42:50
DELLA -- kind of all over my body -- 

00:42:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG As -- 

00:42:50
DELLA -- as part of me -- 

00:42:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:42:50
DELLA -- as part of me. I could feel -- 

00:42:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG As if your body was blanketed by -- 

00:42:55
DELLA And absorbing it. 

00:42:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And absorbing it -- 

00:42:55
DELLA Uh-huh. 

00:42:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- and bringing it in. 

00:42:55
DELLA Yeah. It almost felt tingly; like the blanket that was there before into the future is kind of part of me. 

00:43:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
DELLA So it's not on top of me. It's -- 

00:43:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Now, curiously, we lost a little audio -- 

00:43:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:43:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- right, during the time that I was talking. There was something -- 

00:43:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:43:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- that happened with the microphone. 

00:43:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:43:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG When that happened with the microphone, what happened with you? 

00:43:15
DELLA  Little bit distracted, like -- 

00:43:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Right 

00:43:20
DELLA -- kind of. But it almost felt like I was then jumping into the future, that that was me going into the future. So I liked that sound. 

00:43:25
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So you utilized that and you just made that work. Uh-huh. 

00:43:35
DELLA I liked that sound. 

00:43:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:43:35
DELLA I mean, it was -- it -- it -- it was helpful. 

00:43:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG It was helpful. And you found a way of incorporating that in a helpful way -- 

00:43:45
DELLA Yes. 

00:43:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. -- rather than seeing that as anything that was distracting or perturbing in any way. 

00:43:50
DELLA Right. 

00:43:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. You were able to draw that in. 

00:43:50
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:43:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG That -- fabulously done. Very well done. Uh-huh. 

00:43:55
DELLA Perfectly timed crash. 

00:43:55
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Perfectly timed crash. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Very well done. That was -- that was interesting. Okay, help me now. Where have we taken -- we've gone from -- 

00:44:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:44:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- from there, and heavy and sticky and tight. 

00:44:10
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:44:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG  And we went to here. 

00:44:15
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:44:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And then we went to here. 

00:44:15
DELLA To here. 

00:44:15
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And where are we now? 

00:44:15
DELLA  Now we are that it's -- that has kind of been dispersed all over my body. So it's -- it's -- it's -- it's not here; it's just tiny little molecules kind of in my fingers and in my hands and in my legs. So it's just insignificant. 

00:44:40
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Fabulously done. And yet -- 

00:44:45
DELLA It's still there. 

00:44:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. 

00:44:45
DELLA But it's -- 

00:44:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Incorporated -- 

00:44:45
DELLA Incorporated. 

00:44:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- embodied -- 

00:44:50
DELLA Right. 

00:44:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. -- in a way that blankets you, in a way that transforms that energy into something that could be even experienced in a way that's cellular. Yeah -- 

00:45:00
DELLA Right. 

00:45:00
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG And is -- what's the emotion that goes with that? 

00:45:00
DELLA Kind of relief. 

00:45:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Yes? 

00:45:05
DELLA Um-hum. 

00:45:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Sense of real relief, uh-huh. 

00:45:10
DELLA Real relief. 

00:45:10
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG There's something about the softening of your eyes and -- 

00:45:10
DELLA Um-hum. Because I didn't want to lose it completely, because part of that is what makes me a good professor. 

00:45:20
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Right. 

00:45:20
DELLA You know. And so I didn't want to lose it. I just didn't want it to be right here. I want it to be part of who I am. 

00:45:30
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Beautifully done. Have we accomplished what it is that we've set out to do? 

00:45:35
DELLA Oh, yes. 

00:45:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Very much so? 

00:45:35
DELLA Very much so. 

00:45:35
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Fabulous. You've been really wonderful. Appreciation? And, ah-huh 

00:45:45
[sil.] 

00:45:45
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you so much. 

00:45:45
DELLA Thank you. 

00:45:50
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG So let's stay here for just -- just a minute... So we enter into the world of metaphoria. You know, there's euphoria and there's metaphoria. Uh-huh. And so then rather than saying things in a one-two-three-four way, it's how to think those things in a one-two-three-four way and yet say those things and express those things in a way that is more, um, evocative and that when you go to a concert, you don't go to a concert for information; you go to have an experience, and that experience is going to be enlivened by a process of discovery. You're going to have to discover meaning and make the images or the sounds come alive, but it's going to be your process of discovery. And the purpose of the artist is to set a -- environment in which you can come to the discoveries that are really going to be meaningful. In terms of therapy, what we're -- what I'm thinking about is a reference experience: Can this moment be a reference experience? We all have reference experiences. Reference experiences are what makes our life and our identity cohesive. So we have reference experiences. Like, just because you got your degree doesn't mean that you really feel like you're a therapist. There's a moment in which suddenly you know you're a therapist, and that just seamlessly becomes part of your procedural memory; you know you're a therapist. Might be that moment that you got that degree. But there's a reference experience that you know you’re you're a father. Just because you have a child who is born doesn't mean that you know that you're a dad, but then there's a moment you know you're a dad. And there's a moment that you know that you're a man, and a moment that you know that you're a woman, a moment that you know that you can be a good friend, a moment that you know that you're creative or intelligent or sensitive. There's moments in life that we would call reference experiences, and these seamlessly quilt themselves into forming our identity. And that's what psychotherapy should be about is creating the symbolic drama of change, where the person has a reference experience: 'Oh, got it. Now I can transform, move myself out of that once-stuck spot, into a spot where I can, uh, have this reference experience seamlessly incorporated into the fabric of my identity.' It becomes me and it's no longer something that's, uh, not me. So that's what, uh, I have in mind, and that's what I'm thinking. I think that this is a good time to end, right, rather than, uh, taking any questions or anything like that. But I think that we really don't -- if it was one quick question, I suppose that I could answer it. All right, well, then let's stop. And thank you so much for being here. And thank you so much, Della -- 

00:49:05
DELLA Thank you. 

00:49:05
DR. JEFFREY ZEIG -- for working with me. Thank you so much.
