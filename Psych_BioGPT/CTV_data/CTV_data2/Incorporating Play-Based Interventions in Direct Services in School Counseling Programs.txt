ERIC GREEN Hello and welcome to the new film, Incorporating Play-Based Interventions in Direct Services in School Counseling Programs. I'm Dr. Eric Green, a registered play-therapist supervisor, a credential conferred by the Association for Play-Therapy, as well as a licensed professional counselor supervisor and a Jungian Sandplay Practitioner. I work full-time as an associate professor of school counseling at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where I teach graduate courses and supervise students in school counseling and play. I also maintain a part-time summer teaching schedule at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where I coordinate the annual Johns Hopkins play therapy Institute as well as teach in the school counseling fellows program. I regularly present my research at the annual conferences for the Association for Play Therapy, as well as the American Counseling Association. I was an elementary school counselor during my masters in doctoral programs. And I was trained and mentored by Dr. Rees House in Transformative School Counseling through the Education Trust in Washington D.C. I am the co-editor of the Integrating Expressive Arts and Play with children and adolescents and the author of the handbook of Jungian Play Therapy. I also have a new book coming out in the fall of 2015, titled Counseling Families, Play Based Treatment. This video provides an overview of incorporating play therapy into direct services in transformative school counseling program plans. While the ASCA National Model does not indicate professional school counselors spend a considerable amount of time on individual services, but instead utilize group counseling and large classroom guidance lessons to reach the maximum amount of students. Play based interventions in the correlated skills involved with building a warm non-judgmental relationship with children in school settings does provide implications toward helping children normalize difficult feelings that occur within the school day. And potentially assist them with removing psychological barriers toward academic success. In this video, we will be reviewing Transformative School Counseling, the ASCA National Model and how play therapy may be integrated into the larger context of a developmentally appropriate, preventative school counseling program plan. Also, we will cover two specific play interventions that can be easily adapted in school systems for elementary school children, drawings and narrative therapy. School counselors may utilize play-based approaches and individual counseling, group counseling, crisis counseling in large classroom guidance lessons. The materials required or psycho-educational books, such as what you will be seeing in the video a bit later, The Rainbow Fish, and basic art materials such as plain white paper, markers, crayons and construction paper. ERIC GREEN Now, we will be covering the content based material for this video which will include a brief overview of transformative school counseling as espoused from the Education Trust and the American School Counselor Association. As well as the ASCA National Model, and finally, a step by step directions to implement the play based interventions. Per the Third Edition of the ASCA National Model, the school counseling program plan must answer this question: "How are students different as a result of the comprehensive, developmental, transformative school counseling program?" Transformed School Counseling. School counselors design and deliver comprehensive school counseling programs that promote student achievement via the ASCA National Model. These programs are comprehensive in scope, preventative in design and developmental in nature. School counseling program should be an integral part of students daily educational environment, and school counselor should be partners in students' academic achievement. These are the four quadrants of the ASCA National Model, Third Edition. The emphasis area that this video covers will be the direct services quadrant. This is where school counselors provide individual and group counseling to children in school systems, as well as indirect services such as consultation with teachers and parents. The ASCA National Models, Delivery. Delivery has to do with direct student services. A School Counseling Core Curriculum is comprehensive, it is written in an instructional program design, it is preventative and it is developmental in nature. In Delivery services, we provide individual student planning a school counselors, we also appraise and advise students to help them establish academic goals and future career plans. Direct or formally referred to as Responsive Services, help meet students' immediate emotional needs, we do this through crisis intervention, group counseling, individual counseling and to some extent, classroom lessons. Delivery, from this table, we see how the ASCA model identifies the specifics of the different components of direct services. The elements and strategies include school counseling core curriculum instruction, group activities, individual student planning, appraisal, advising, counseling, and crisis response. The students served are on a continuum from all students served to specific identified students, mostly by teachers through referrals. The recipients are typically data driven. In other words, the referrals are made through specific data forms that are collated through the school counselor's office and disseminated by the school counselor to teachers and administrators. And the methods included in the Delivery model are interactions with students in large groups, classroom guidance, small group counseling and individual counseling. Academic Results, when incorporating relaxation techniques, paired with play therapy interventions in school counseling programs, as we can see from this diagram, there is an increase in relaxation and self-awareness in students and an increase in motivation toward academic goals. After individual or group direct services, pre and post test have indicated that student knowledge of relaxation and self-awareness increased to up to 88%, as well as 70% achieved their identified academic goal. One mechanism to implement direct services for young children in elementary school systems is through the use of play and expressive arts. Expressive arts include all of the art disciplines, photos, art, play, dance/movement, music, drama, writing and poetry. These are used to meet school children developmentally and creatively to assist when forming therapeutic relationships with self-expression and with externalizing difficulties which may decrease anxiety the increased motivation toward academic success. The rationale for the use of play therapy with children in schools includes, it stimulates all of the senses and elicits thoughts and feelings the child may be unaware of or have difficulty expressing. This helps the student by engaging the right brain, senses, experience, affect. Promoting self-awareness. Decreasing anxiety. And allowing the implicit to become explicit. Two specific play based interventions to incorporate in school counseling include drawings and reading books to children or narrative therapy. In drawings, we first participate in deep breathing. Next, we ask the child to draw anything they like. If they are resistant or reticent to draw, we may perhaps ask them to use sand miniatures to create a scene. Then we sit in silence as they are drawing or sanding. Afterwards we ask, is there anything you'd like to share about your drawing? If you could give this drawing a title, what would it be? If you were inside this drawing, what would you feel like? Through the use of art, children are able to externalize difficult feelings in a non-threatening manner and may choose to draw or discuss creative solutions to recurring problems at both home and school. The second intervention is Rainbow Fish. Read the story to the child. Actively participate in the story by perhaps asking questions as you read aloud. If the child wants to read parts of it, let him or her. After the book is read, ask the child question specific to the theme of the book such as, what did Rainbow Fish learn from the story. Then, perhaps relate it back to the child's current situation by asking questions like, have you ever felt like Rainbow Fish? Have you ever felt afraid? What did you do to help yourself not feel afraid? Then ask the child to draw an image based upon the story and what they learned from it. This helps the child identify coping strategies and illustrates for them a concrete visual. If there is resistance to draw ask the child to sand a picture of what he or she learned from the story. Now we're going to review the play therapy within direct services at schools. Here are some points that I'd like for you, the viewer, to take away as a transfer of learning from the video. Number one, children like to draw in color. This often helps them establish identity. Play therapy can be used in individual or group responsive services within school counseling program plans because they are time specific. Number three, when children color, they are making a personal symbol that reveals who they are at that moment. Conflicts appear in their mandalas and drawings and sand play as well which serve to release tension of opposites and could potentially help them transition back into the classroom environment following the school counseling session. Fourth, narrative therapy such as the use of Rainbow Fish can also be delivered in time-specific intervals and assist children with their coping skills. Especially, when they are having difficulties with social situations such as we saw in the video today, if children are feeling as though they are being bullied, narrative and psycho educational materials can help them find their courage. Finally, use of play in schools increases relaxation through the use of progress… progressive muscle relaxation which decreases anxiety and increases motivation towards academic success. So for you, the viewer, the final question, the final transfer of learning, how might your students be different as a result of incorporating play into direct services in your school counseling program plan? Thank you, for joining me today to learn a little bit more about the incorporation of play therapy into developmental school counseling program plans. I hope that you have found this video instructional and informative. And I wish you well in your future school counseling endeavors.
