CAMILLO LORIEDO Ladies and gentlemen, let's start this, ah, topic panel on, ah, couples and family therapy, and, ah, we will have a very distinguished panelist like, ah, Helen LaKelly Hunt and Sue Johnson, Harriet Lerner, Harville Hendrix who is coming. And, ah, we will start with Helen. Can you please... 

00:00:25
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Yes. Uhm, well, Harville and I, uhm, are both so honored to be asked on-- to be on this panel with Harriet and Sue. I've just been such fans, I mean, for years of Harriet's work and in every-- the field has benefited so much from all. Sue has brought in with fundamental size make change, ah, in her depth understanding of human nature and relationships. But, uhm, uhm, I, uhm, will talk a little bit about my relationship, how I met Harville and how we moved into relationship. And then, talk about Imago theory and therapy, and how we understand it helping couples today. So, I'll first say that I saw this good looking man like walking into a room, like-- we, we, we actually planned this, that he's gonna walk in just as I said that. So, uhm, and I went, "Wow, what a good looking man." We, we planned this for two days that he would walk in, so, glad you're all appreciate our efforts. So, it was about, uhm, 1979 and, uhm,-- oh, he had-- well, he had a divorce and I was divorced, and I saw him at a party and someone said I should meet him. He was a professor at, ah, Perkins at Southern Methodist University, uhm, teaching marriage and family. Uhm, and, uhm, I was so interested in psychology and religion, myself. And, uhm, so, I got it-- got-- I did everything I could to get him to ask me out on a date. So, on one of our early dates, I said, uhm, "But tell me more about you, your work Harville, I'm really interested to know your work, you know, teaching marriage and family, I'm so interested in the subject." He said, "Well, actually, I just got fired from Perkins." I mean, "You got fired, I'm so sorry. But I've heard that students love you." And he said, "Well, I never published anything. They won't publish anything that I-- I've written." And so I said, "Oh, I'm so sorry." So, he said, "But they, you know, they gave me a three-year contract but no tenure." So, I said, "Well, what do you want to do, uhm, after that?" And he had a couple options, but he said-- but, he said, "I could do this, I could do that. But you know what I'd really love to do?" And and he said, "What?" I said, "What?," and he said, "I'd like to write a book on a subject." I said, "What's the subject?" "I want to understand why do couples fight, why does the marriage of our dreams turn into the relationship of our nightmares." I was so galvanized as he began to talk. And, uhm, one of the things that had impacted me as a young woman, ah, ah, late teenage was Dostoevsky's quote, if you see-- or if you're seeking God, you'll never find, find God in the empty firmament of your mind. You'll find God in human love. And I thought, "What a powerful thing, he wants to study love." I was in a family that-- ah, business family. They were building shopping centers, developing oil, wells, and all. And I said, "Does the world need another shopping center, but the world needs is a great book on marriage." So, uhm, I had a masters in counseling at the time, having studied, especially, Roger's work client-centered. So, I understood empathy and Kirchhoff's studies at the time. I had been exposed to, uhm, the Golding's, ah, transactional analysis and Gestalt, their month-long training at Mount Madonna. Primal Therapy, I was interested in re-parenting. So, I really jumped in, met Harville. And so appreciated all of the importance he gave to identifying childhood wounding. And I wanted to help, as a sort of a silent partner in the work, in any way that I could. So, Imago therapy moved out with this primary focus on identifying childhood wounds. And at that time, therapy in the 70's talked about catharsis. It's important to get your anger out and feel the feelings you haven't felt before. Anger is our friend. Uhm, and so, the-- as the flagship exercise of Imago was an, an ex-- an exercise about expressing your ang-- anger to your partner. And Harville and I did that a lot in our marriage. But we noticed was our marriage was getting worse and worse, and worse until we went-- we finally said, "Harville, you're so famous now, we have to go therapy." And I dragged him to the top therapist in New York, and we fired her after two months cuz we knew more than she did. So we tried a-- we tried another therapist. We went to five New York therapists and the last one finally called us the couple from hell. And, uhm, so, we went home and we realized we made a big shift in Imago therapy at that time. And I'll begin to tell you about it, and Harville about to pick up and take over. We realized that if we wanna-- if we want to learn about mental health, it's important to study health. We were so fixated on that wounding experience and how to feel those feelings and work with that wound, that we realized that while wound identification is important, it's important to then, uhm, move into, uhm, a different kind of thinking that helps create safety in the relationship. We were-- we were aware that the DSM-IV, I believe, there are 265 diagnoses for ways you can be mentally, uhm, mis-- malfunctioning. There's a lot of diagnosis around illness. We think we need a DSM that is all about 265 ways to experience joy.

00:07:30
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT So, we have radically changed Imago therapy, ah, in that emphasis. We've touched on the wound and then put people immediately into the practice of health. Again, believing energy follows attention. Uhm, the last three things I'll say before turning this over to Harville, I realized that Harville and I were sort of addicted to negativity. I didn't think I was being negative, I thought I was being helpful. As I helped advice around his wardrobe, which believe may needed it. My, or-- the gold chain around his neck and the velvet jacket, I mean, much less his social skills, you know. I, I, you know, I wanted people to like him so, I felt like he need, you know-- and I wasn't even gonna charge him for this advice. I mean, I was philanthropically gonna give this out of the goodness of my heart, and, uhm, plus, his parenting skills. You know, so, I didn't think I was being negative, but, I began to see my beloved just withdraw more and more, and work more and more. So, there were ways we both we're being very negative and basically, we got, I said, "Harville, let's get a calendar, we'll gonna stay married. Let's get a calendar and end all negativity." Harville will tell you what happened with that calendar. Uhm, we've actually you're gonna a-- hope to start a global campaign to see if you can make it through a day with zero negativity in your relationship. We believe you can deal with issues in your relationship, it's not what you say, it's how you say it. And the-- well, you like that? You like that? So, uhm, so, he will tell you, uhm, uhm, of how-- but, what was, ah, ah, really a learning experience for us, those therapists didn't work because we had been a part of writing books on helping couples in distress. But, we'd also read everyone that was out there, and we were facing-- we were talking to divorce early years. What saved us was a calendar where at the end of the day if there was, ah, any negativity, there would be a frowny face, and at the end of the day, if we tried-- if we succeeded, there would be a smiley face. And it took Harville and I months to break our diction. We just had frowny face, frowny face, frowny face and we were-- do you know how humiliating that was for us that we couldn't pull off 124-hour period without one of us turning negative. We were trying our best. So, we have frowny face, frowny face, frowny face, frowny face, finally, we broke our diction and we brought in joy and pleasure. Uhm, I told Harville, "This is not marketing, believe me." I told Harville, "You are so funny when you do a workshop and you're so funny when we get into play. On opera, you're very serious and scholarly. Could I produce a funny book on marriage? I wanna take Imago theory and make it funny, and I wanna make it with cartoons. Would you mind if I did that?" He said, "Okay, Helen, you can try. We'll probably have to give it away." He helped with the outline, but, of course, I know the theory. We se-- we had an auction in New York with the publishers and they started competing, and they really bid a lot, and we were so happy. And they published the book, ah, six months ago. It's a polka dots on the cover. We are bringing joy and pleasure so much more into our work with couples. The last thing I want to mention is that I learned a few years ago that the etymology of holy and silly is the same. They have the same Germanic route solely in the 1200s. Solely met holy and silly. They were one and the same, and over time, the word holy beg-- began to refer to piousness, and silly began to be something that, uhm, was sort of, ah, ah, a degra-- a degrading-- had a degrading quality to it. But in our workshops, we teach our couples to be silly. We essentially recover play and because with silliness and play, the relationship become safe. With safety, anxiety is reduced. When anxiety reduced, defenses go down. And when defenses go down, our authentic selves emerge and the part of us can be vulnerable and connect. So, Harville gonna take it.

00:13:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, uhm, so, am I as handsome as you said? And I wanna be sure to work within the time frame cuz I, ah,-- we will gonna talk 10 minutes each. And, so, how much time should I use? 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN For your good looks, you can have 15. 

00:13:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Because I'm good looking, I can have 15? So, and, and have you all gone yet, I, I went to the wrong room. So, I was-- I was late because I had Marriott at, uhm, uhm, Platinum six through 10. And I never got-- I didn't read the, uhm,-- well, anyway, uhm, I'm here. Uhm, so, ah, thanks for the-- for the start out. Uhm, I think the, the thing that I'd like to start, ah, with is, is there's a, uhm, sort of an awareness that, ah, Dan Siegel had when he was beginning to talk about mental healths. And you all, all may have heard him tell the story and so I won't tell a story but basically, it was that he, ah, questioned, uhm,-- the last time I heard him tell a story is something like 70,000 people and asked them what mental health was, and he found that, that we were in an industry of producing a product and getting paid to help people get something that nobody could define. And that he spent a lot of time getting that definition of what mental health is, and, at least, to working definition agreed upon. So, Helen and I had a similar, ah, experience with, uhm, with marriage therapy, couples therapy, which is, what is it that, uhm, we are doing-- when the couple comes in, what should be the condition of the couple when they leave, and that, that should there be, uhm, in an idiosyncratic and unique outcome for therapy, or is there a method, theoretical, uhm, or description of what a truly healthy great marriage is, healthy couple is? And, ah, over the years, uhm, ah, and like Dan asking mental health people, ah, we asked couples what a great marriage would look like. And we done this for so long and it's not hard science as Dan's final definition was also a conversation in the collaboration and not scientific in the sense that it had been put to an experimental test. And so, uhm, so, what we have asked couples over the years, uhm, what will be the ultimate, uhm, positive outcome and we had thousands and thousands of, of, ah, nouns and, and adjectives that we have put together in the kind of a fact or analysis. And can you imagine what one-- there, there are three words that we, uhm, we discovered showed up over and over again, ah, to the point that we could begin to anticipate, ah, whatever language the couples used, or whatever words they used, the words always reflected a core word. Can anybody imagine what the primary word is that describes-- of the three, and that describes the optimal marriage healthy relationship, the marriage of your dreams? Anybody want to try out? And, why-- yell it out that I could hear it. What? 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Joy. 

00:17:10
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Someone said, joy. 

00:17:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Many said, joy. Yeah. Well, this is the way we got it. Every-- everybody, I mean, those are all in some sense very similar words, and they-- none-- no one very threw out a negative word like, ah, marriage is about anxiety, wor-- ah, like marriage is about, uhm, uhm, fighting or about conflict. They knew that's what couples do, but, they didn't see that as the optimal word. So, the word that, uhm, was pulled together, as the first word, is that the relationship has to be safe. And the, uhm, feedback on that is that somebody got safety, you are-- you're bumping, you know, you first out there you said, safety, that if, if the relationship isn't safe, the relationship then, cannot be safe, that is it can't be optimal, it's not a dream relationship that safety is, is the on-ramp. And, the, ah, second word, ah, that came up, ah, had to do-- ah, that safe-- safety turned out to be the on-ramp that is-- that's the condition that one has to live in, that's the-- and atmosphere of the ecosystem of the marriage is that it's safe. So, what is the second word? Would anybody have a thought about that, what the second word might be? You've been-- you've been listening. Yes. You were in the workshop yesterday. I remember you're sitting on the front row and you had your eyes closed most of the time. So, I didn't-- I didn't know you are listening, but I, I can see that you're listening with your eyes closed. And your head was leaning back a little bit like this, like right, right now. So, I think you cheated by, you know, by being there. Uhm, so, and, and, and that is the word. That if it's safe, ah, and has to be safe, and it has to be safe before, ah, you can experience, ah, connection. And by connection, ah, there's a range of, uhm, meanings that, that could have, but it turns out to be something very, uhm, ordinary, none esoteric. And that's that we feel like we are, are couple. Ah, we feel, uhm,-- we can hang out together, we are, uhm,-- we can resonate with each other's feelings and we move together, we can dance together. Uhm, and, and also that our connection with, with our-- with each other is somehow feels continuous with being connected with into, uhm, a larger ecosystem, uhm, which includes, ah, not only our children but the, uhm, natural word. You know, some sense of belonging and that the belonging is more than just in this relationship, but it's a cosmic belonging that it has something to do with the-- with the, ah, largest, uhm, visions of the human experience, when the human experience is had itself, ah, had its optimum. So, there was a third word, uhm, that has come out. And, ah, you can't-- you can't cheat again, and, ah, and tell-- uhm, anybody want to throw out the, the third word? 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN Joy. 

00:20:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Joy. You-- come-- yes. But joy is the word. It, it came out first, joy is the word. So, safety is the condition that it is the-- that's the atmosphere of the ecosystem of the relationship, it's safe to be here with this person. And that safety has an extension to it that one feels safer in the whole ecosystem of humanity and on the planet if they're safety, locally. And that connection then is possible only because, ah, we feel safe, that is if you don't feel safe then the connecting, in fact, we have-- I just recently changed the word, ah, from connection to connecting because connecting is a gerund and has some sense of activity risk, connection is a noun and has an element of, of static element to it. But connecting being a very active and dynamic, ah, sense, and joy turns out to be what one is experiencing when one is connecting. And that without connecting, joy is now possible so, that joy or joyful aliveness. And in fact, two words are used that mirror them, two ends of the central nervous system, sympathetic and very sympathetic, it's, uhm, uhm, re-- uhm, joyful aliveness and relaxed joyfulness, that there's a continuum intensity of feeling. Now, so, those are the, the words, and we have decided that having learned, or actually everything that we have learned about couples therapy from couples, ah, spending about eight years, ah, from, ah, 19, ah, 19, ah, 77 to 1988 including writing getting love you one, ah, doing couples therapy and interviewing couples and getting their words. And, and then, and then actually, ah, couples therapy is-- was taught to us by couples who told us how to treat them which was an answer to the question, and then we would then create therapy around what they said would work and it worked. And then after a while we realized it was not an idiosyncrasy to these couples but a general pattern that what work with one couple tend to work sometimes with more difficulty than with another couple with that. So, the, ah, other piece then that comes from, uhm, safety connection and joy is, ah, what are the conditions that allow safety and that led to an-- ah, to a, a logical term, uhm, in which is, ah,-- what would you think? What, what interrupts safety? What, what has to be like go off? Negativity. Yeah. That negativity is the, ah, destroyer of safety so that one cannot be negative and experience negativity, and feel safe, one cannot experience negativity and feel joy, one cannot experience negativity and feel connection because negativity creates anxiety. And when you feel anxious as a result of the rapture of connection which is what happens when one is negative, then, you go into a defensive mode, and that is the mode of being with each other protected from each other that, ah, couples bring to the therapy office or to the workshop. They do not-- obviously, do not come with safety connection and joy, they would be outplaying gulf or fishing somewhere. Uhm, so, thank you. Uhm, so that, ah, negativity then becomes the enemy of, of safety connection and joy. And we decided, ah, that, that since that had become a-- have started, there's a personal experience that we would move to understanding and putting negativity into a central place. Uhm, now, as the, uhm, thing that had to be regulated. And, so, all of the Imago processes actually regulate, uhm, negativity and create safety, but we decided to push it further and-- are now talking about negativity as, as Helen said as a, uhm, a, a major, uhm, thing to pay attention to, to remove negativity, go to zero negativity, and zero negativity being the, uhm, outcome. So, if a couple goes to therapy, we say, and they finished therapy, ah, and they are still exchanging negative interactions, namely, putting each other down, they've not finished therapy, they've just stopped, that the end of therapy would be zero negativity namely, that you feel with predict-- some predictability. All-- we all be human and there be breakdown to some predictability that you can count on, or your partner being, ah, intending to be zero negative so, that it's safe to be with your partner, so that you can be connected in joy. So, we're taking that idea now and beginning to institutionalize it in the therapeutic process in, in the workshop, and bringing two couples a, uhm, zero negativity challenge, and as Helen said, a calendar, we formalize the calendar and, uhm, ah, have all kinds of ways for them to practice that, so. 

00:26:35
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT And what we did in our struggle was, in addition to the calendar, every night, three appreciations, you have to put appreciations in to create the joy and we just know from personal experience that can transform the relationship. 

00:26:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I think we should stop there so that we have time of everybody else. 

00:26:55
CAMILLO LORIEDO Okay. Sue Johnson, please. 

00:27:00
SUE JOHNSON Hi. Hi, everybody. Uhm, so, the whole field of, uhm, couple therapy, I don't know where to begin so I just, or I'd say, a couple of things and then just tell you a story, because, uhm, EFT is all about emotional engagement. So, if I tell you a story, you'll become emotionally engaged and you'll hear the information on a different level. Uhm, I'm not su-- I-- I'm not sure that I see safety in the relationship as zero negativity. I think, uhm, what happy couples do is they turn moments of disconnection and help each other with their feelings of disconnection and pain, and fear and, uhm, help each other back into that safety. Ah, I guess, I just want to say in general, I think this is a, a very pivotal time for a field. Uhm, I think, it's the time for our field where we're starting to have maps, clear maps for, uhm, feelings and emotions, and needs and dramas that couples have been doing since the beginning of time and haven't understood. So, we've experienced love or something that happens to us. And I think for the first time now in human history, we're actually starting to understand love to the point where we can actually do it. We can do it and we can make it and I'm not just talking about making love, sex, I'm not. So, the EFT, what I do, emotionally focused therapy, is a way of seeing couple relationships. Uhm, I'm gonna touch with the theories so, I see romantic love as an attachment bond, the prototype of which is the bond between mother and child. And I see, I'll need for emotional connection with another human being that we can depend on as our deepest need, much more profound that either sex or aggression. I think it's the most basic instinct we have. So, I see relationships in a particular way, I see that we, ah, experienced moments of disconnection from those we love as deeply dangerous and very terrifying, and that's why I didn't do on a million brain. Ah, brains are structured around the fact that we know, when we are born that if we call and no one comes, we die. And that experience helps to structure a nervous system. So, I see relationships in terms of a bond and EFT is also a very particular way of intervening where we help people deal with emotions in the different way. And therefore, send new emotional signals to their partner, partner-- signals that invite their partner close rather than scaring their partner or pushing their partner away. But EFT is also a way of being with people and here, I think, uhm, perhaps, is the greatest similarity between Imago and EFT, which is the idea of creating safety in the session for people who are dealing with the pain of their relationship and being impacted with them in their pain, which I think is, is very important and-- you know, when I say this, everybody nods. But actually, when I look out into the world, there's a real-- there's another model out there which I call the straight coaching model which is basically, rather than being impacted with people, you basically say, uhm, "Stop doing what you're doing. Would you please stop doing what you're doing? Ah, just do something else instead." And, we call this therapy? I don't think that's therapy. And EFT was easy as that, we'd opened it up for job. So, uhm, having said that little bit, I thought, just illustrate because this is a panel and you guys have listened people speaking all day. I just tell you a funny story. Okay? So, what the hell? Right. So, so, uhm, I live in a very small community in the capital of Canada. And so, people know me and my-- the old part of the city, and there's a Starbucks that I go to all the time. So, a few years ago, uhm, I and my son were, what you might call disconnected. And, uhm, I've been worrying about this so, I decided to get EFT. Uhm, I'll gonna read, uhm, Harville Hendrix, John Gottman, uhm, everyone, I can meet everyone and I'll do something different with my son. So, uhm, I just been reading John Gottman the night before. So, my son and I walk into Starbucks. So, people know me as a, you know, ah, well-known therapist. So, I walk into Starbucks, and I'd been listening to John Gottman who's-- talks about softened start-up. So, I say to my son, "You know sweetie heart, I think we should have a little tiny chat about the fact that you are failing Grade 12!" And this is why skills are tricky, okay? Because emotion is more powerful than skills. And it's only when you've got your emotional balance that you can use your skills and emotion leaks. So, all my son does-- and this is something about the power of the messages between people who love each other, all my son does is this, ah. Everybody get that? It's like, "Gosh, it's such a shame." It's just missive. So then, a whole lot of things happen in my brain and in my body. And, uhm, what starts to happen is-- basically, what happen is I explode, I explode, and my EFT therapist partner says, "Don't do this. Don't do this, you're in the middle of Starbucks in your community." Well, this is embarrassing and, uhm, my also EFT therapist says, "Regulate your emotion, uhm, move into empathy." But the point is that emotion is more powerful than that, and so what I do is I raised my voice and say, "Oh, right! What's this supposed to mean? Right! Right! Oh!" And I start screaming and head off, and basically saying, "I'm your mother, and you will listen to me. And when I told you, you will listen to me, right?" And then my son turns around and says, "You are being embarrassing." 

00:34:05
[sil.] 

00:34:10
SUE JOHNSON And I say, "Oh, you think this is embarrassing?" And I said, "I haven't even starting yet, I'm just about to..." And the only thing that changes it is not the insight in my head, or all my therapist skills are practiced with thousands of couples, the only thing that changes is, is the barista that says, "Would you like cinnamon on the top of your?" So, we sit down-- and please, notice, it's humbling to tell you it was not me who change the level of emotional engagement which is what you have to do with couples, uhm, and it's not me who did that. My sweet son turned to cr-- turned to me and looked to me, and said, "Well, that conversation didn't go to well, did it?" So, he went meter, he went above and instead of watching the ball come across the net, and then putting it back and watching the ball, he looked at the whole game, and he commented on the game. He changed the level of engagement to where we saw the game. And I was humbled by that and I went the other way. We do both in EFT, we help people see the drama, the dance, their quatrain and how it scares the hell out of them and creates constant insecurity and disconnection. And we go back the other way to the softer emotion. So, I go the other way and I say, "Ah, you know, Tim, I started in the wrong place. What I should have told you is, I'm really, really scared. I'm really scared because I'm your mom and I'm supposed to know how fix everything. And, uhm, you're failing Grade 12 and I feel like there's nothing I can do about it." And what's interesting is that when I go soft and I am not a threat, and I share myself to feelings, I invite him to join me and so my son says, "Oh, you're scared. I'm not failing Grade 12, mom, I haven't gone to one class off, done one assignment since the beginning of the year. I am completely, totally failed and I'm scared to death as well." So then, what do we do, we sit and we comfort each other and we help each other without fear. And you could look at the whole of EFT and say, that it's all about helping couples talk about their softer fears and hurts, and longings that are not met and depth perversions, and it's all about moving couples to a place where they can help each other, reach for each other and help each other with those feelings. So then, Tim and I helped each other with those feelings. And we don't have a solution when we walked out that coffee store, but we do have a source of comfort and safety so that we can start to have conversations that aren't about criticism or blaming, or advice giving, or justification, or defense, or power trips, but are all about us, both holding hands and looking at this difficult situation that we both feel bad about. And finally enough, I feel like that was the beginning of us, collaborating to the point where, uhm, my son was able to really look what he wanted out of life. So, uhm, I wanna tell you that story because I think it has some of the elements of what happens in a good EFT session. In my sessions, I feel like I invite couples to create safety and connection for each other so, that they begin to change each other and help each other grow. That's really what happens in the EFT.

CAMILLO LORIEDO Harriet. 

00:38:20
HARRIET LERNER Thank you so much. My-- am I-- I am, come on, okay. Come on. Uhm, actually since-- Harville you brought Helen here, I-- my psychologist husband is here. I did not invite him up but I think you should stand up, Steve. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:50
HARRIET LERNER Now, actually, the real reason I ask him to stand up, I like to identify family members because once I was giving a talk to a very large audience, my mother who is 87 years old, who was there in the back and very proud, and I mentioned that my mother was in the audience but I didn't ask her to stand up being that she was 87. So. there were people in the back of her who didn't know that she was my mother, and began with a running conversation about me. And, and it was not, by the way, how brilliant and funny I was. It was things like, you know, like, what if she get her hair out of her face, and, uhm, can't someone teach her how to put make up on, and etcetera, etcetera, my poor mother is trapped there. Therefore, you know where Steve is. Those of you who are sitting in back of him. And you can watch yourself. Now, Steve and I could never aim for zero negativity. We, you know, I'm a youngest child from a Brooklyn Jewish family. I'd like to fight, uhm, not only with Steve, but my youngest son. My younger son, Ben, was a champion debater and, ah,-- although I do not believe that mothers cause their children's problems or gifts, I believe he got his debating skills fighting with me. And Steve and I, you know, one of the things I remember most vividly from our early years together because we met in graduate school in New York, we were in the same clinical psychology program. As I remember having a fight in the street, I think it was Broadway, in the upper west side, and we were having a theoretical fight about the difference between repression and denial. And we were really going at it. And I was right.

HARRIET LERNER And he probably started it because the mature woman always blames her spouse. Uhm, in a more serious note, I, I was confessing to someone, this is the first, uhm, professional event that I'd ever done where I walked in entirely unprepared. You know, I thought, here are the top experts in couples therapy, and I looked at the title of this, ah, panel, family and couples therapy. And this for me translated into all of life, uhm, because I am a systemic thinker, uhm, I really-- whoever comes in the room and who wants to be in therapy, I will work with. And when I said that I'm a family systems thinker-- I know that the term family systems therapy mean something different to every person, now, here is it, just like the word feminism means something different to every person who hears it, and then, my feminist family systems thinker. But what both feminism and family systems thinking have to do with is seeing a problem in the broadest possible context. Uhm, so, I mentioned for those of you who heard me earlier that I do a multi-generational genogram for every person that I see. And I often work on marital problems with one person in the room. And, uhm, family systems thinking also has to do not only with broadening the context or rather than thinking of the mother child diet, uhm, or thinking of the marital couple, one would see the marriage, ah, in the context of the family and the context of the extended family, and the context of multi-generational triangles. And family systems thinking also has to do with depreciating the interconnectedness of all things as John Muir put it, the naturalist, if you pull out any one thing, you find it connected to everything else in the universe. So, the given example, very, very briefly cuz this example is in the dance of anger of, of-- actually, my helping a marriage dramatically and never seeing the couple was, for example, ah, a woman came to see me for therapy. Her husband did not wanna join her, he thought therapy was a lot of bank. Uhm, she came in very worried about her 8-year-old child, Billy, who was getting into more and more trouble in school. She was very angry at her husband who she felt was overly stern with Billy, uhm, a real law, law and order guy, very over focused on him. So, one of the first things I did, because I only had her in the office, he wasn't coming in, was to track the interactional sequence that surrounded Billy symptomatic behavior which began when he was 8. And the sequence-- and I'll give you the sequence of a particular night, uhm, but this was a repetitive sequence in the family, was that dad would come home from work, Billy would be watching television instead of doing his homework, dad would get very reactive, get very blaming towards Billy said, "Turn off the TV," say, "You were supposed to do your homework, you're not doing your homework, you're not being responsible," etcetera. Mother, ah,-- they were pretty polarized, he stood for a law and understand, he-- she stood for love and understanding, and he stood for law and order. So, mother would yell in from the kitchen, "If you wouldn't be so hard on the boy, you know, he would be doing a lot better." At which point, father would turn his anger at his wife and say, "If you didn't spoil him and set some limits to begin with, we wouldn't have this problem." They would start fighting. And then, Billy would go to his room with the headache and continue to act out. So, one of the first things I did, and I have to abbreviate this tremendously, was really help the mother really track and see the sequence. And through questioning, she, herself, realized, uhm, that being in the middle of the relationship, ah, was not helpful, which she was doing was not helpful, and I helped her to change her place in the triangle. And to let Billy and his dad negotiate, uhm, their relationship. Well, what happened then-- and this is how thing shift around when you were systematically, is the dad became very depressed and he came in to see me, and, uhm, she had stopped. And it was very interesting to do the genogram on his side because one of my question is why things heated up for Billy at the age of 8. And looking at the genogram, dad was 8 when his dad died. And dad was also the same age that his dad was, when he died. So, it's a double anniversary reaction. And the work-- a lot of the work I did with him was, what I call family of origin work and it was, it was very slow, you know, I didn't-- and he reconnected with his mother and older sister as well ultimately as with his dad's-- is to see his dad's family. Uhm, in that work, I, I describe in the dance of anger, but the long and short of what I'm saying since I can't teach systems theory and therapy in, in five minutes is that through the work that he did, and through the fact that for the first time, he began authentic relationships with his mother and ask her for help, uhm, to help him remember what had happened in the family around the time of his dad's death, and he learned to share vulnerability. And in the end, uhm, there was an enormous change in, in the marriage and in the sense of connection and, uhm, the sen-- the sense of actually for immaturity and more self-esteem and self-worth. You know, uhm, this is like so highly condensed but the point is that I supposed if I represent a different perspective in working with couples, uhm, my perspective is that I am very, very hopeful working with one person. If I get the person and the couple with their mode are running for change, or the person who is in pain since change, but politically and personally off and comes from the bottom up, from the person who feels the least power, ah, and is do-- and is suffering more, uhm, I worked very effectively. This is by no means to say that I recommend working with one person rather than working with the couple. And I remember, Harville, you're telling me how much fun you had-- were have working with couples that you can imagine working with one person. I would say, probably, most honestly, that I am not a skilled, ah, because my background, uhm, probably and experience that I am not a brilliant therapist often when I have a difficult couple in the room compared to what I'm ab-- I'm able to do if I have one person in the room. And I will often-- when I do have a couple, defocus the marriage to brought in the perspective of the patterns coming down the generation, the issues with the family of origin, the triangles, the mother and law triangle. For example, if you're seeing a couple where the wife and the mother in law are fighting it out, you will also see a man who cannot take a position with his own mother. This is like a law of physics. So, I work-- I work very hard, uhm, to help men find their voice in a way that protects-- you know, no one can choose or should ever choose between their mother and their wife but there are ways to help people work on this triangles in this pattern. So, my perspective, uhm, is, is, ah, my original training was defocused on the mother child diet which back then, by the way, back then, when I was at Menninger and I would-- I went there in 1972. You know, a lot of it was a very reductionistic linear backwards mother blaming theoretical perspective, and, of course, if that's your territory that you're looking at, I mean, if that's your map, your-- or your map or figure territory, in that perspective for me, uhm, has widened enormously. So, the moral of the, ah, story I guess, is that there are so many different ways to work and it's a great honor for me to, to be with all of you. Thank you.

CAMILLO LORIEDO Ah, I think we have time only for one question, one, so, the one will rise first to the microphone. And in, in the me-- two minutes? Oh. And, ah, why-- okay, you are there. Ah, let's be just comment-- oh, I am happy to hear how much family therapist are able to address themselves, open themselves. I think it's, ah, something that surprising me-- ah, I am a family therapist too and I think this is the community in which people like mo-- more, participating their feelings being a therapist. So, ah, I think it's, ah, a very good thing to have, ah, such, ah, ah, good, ah, sub disclosure when you speak about yourself. Ah, even though, we are speaking to family's couples, we are were or what we feel and what we are. So, thank you for this. First question and last. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN I would just be interested in the panel's opinion about what to do with, ah, particularly difficult couple that I have. There, I feel like I've done a lot of work to try, try to help this couple and throughout, uhm, through their softer, emotions rather than the wife who can be quite cold and passive-aggressive, and the husband who can be somewhat narcissistic and more aggressive, aggressive in session. There's no battering that's going, but they're just not very kind to one another and even though, I've worked with them now for a number of-- actually, it's been over three years, and they've been very consistent with their therapy. It's very hard for them to achieve that connection and really have that joy and playfulness with one another with the anger and the lack of safety that the wife feels emotionally in the relationship, and the husband to seems to have a lot of trouble regulating his emotion, that way, and gets flooded quite easily. So, I just love to know your perspective and suggestions on this to further our work. 

00:53:30
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Uhm, let me, uhm, just be a bridge to your question by saying something I heard each of us say on the panel which was connection. Uhm, I heard you, Harriet, talk about in the genogram, how the young men when he-- when he began to connect with other people in the family that the authenticity emerge for connection, and you, Sue, your reaction to us, talking about zero negativity, you said, well, wait, here, the couples being able to bring their fear to each other and share-- it is about connection, and I just want to say-- and then, Sue, I'll pass this to you, I think, are you wanting to comment on this? 

00:54:10
SUE JOHNSON No. 

00:54:10
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT Okay. That, that, uhm, that Harville and I, uhm, have, uhm, recently, ah, in our appreciation of the dialogue pro-- process, the dialogue, ah, structured way, two people can move from conflict into connection, instead of the anger, ah, expression exercised being the flagship, it's the dialogue process that it's the flagship and we have renamed it recently in a lot of context, and we're talking about it as safe conversation where it's structured and two people can express their fears, express their, uhm, concerns, express their longings, taking turns in a structured way. And the zero negativity fits into the middle that, ah,-- if two people between each other can have zero negativity then, that structure exercised simply. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN Are there just some people that this just-- uhm, some people would just seem like this come so easily to and even though they came in, in about place, they're able to make that shift more easily, and some people just did the personality type or perhaps prior injury, they're just-- it takes some very long time, is that what you see? 

00:55:30
HELEN LAKELLY HUNT I think it's structured. 

00:55:30
SUE JOHNSON Uhm, I guess what I would say to you is that you need to deepen the emotion and go for the threat, the threat that is in de-- is triggering the anger, and then tell you help them with that threat. They won't stop being angry with each other. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN Thank you.
