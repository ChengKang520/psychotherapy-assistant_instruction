Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888-505-5576 Email: info@emicrotraining.com Website: www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates presents Emotional Roadblocks to Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice A Conversation with Mark Kiselica, Ph.D. and Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. Moderated by Madonna G. Constantine, Ph.D. Series To Accompany: COUNSELING THE CULTURALLY DIVERSE: THEORY AND PRACTICE By Derald Wing Sue & David Sue Publisher: John Wiley & Sons 

00:00:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Hello. My name is Madonna Constantine, and I'm here today to interview Dr. Derald Wing Sue and Dr. Mark Kiselica about the book, "Counseling the Culturally Diverse". Since its initial publication in 1981, "Counseling the Culturally Diverse" has gone through four revisions, and it's the most frequently used textbook in the field of multicultural counseling. Today, I'd like to find out about Dr. Sue's and Dr. Kiselica's experiences regarding the book, along with some of the experiences and transformations they may have experienced with regard to their journey toward cultural competence. So, I guess we'll start with Dr. Sue and ask him to share some of his background with regard to early life experiences, childhood experiences, in particular, that kind of brought you to this point in your journey of cultural competence, and then we'll follow with you, Dr. Kiselica. 

00:01:20
DERALD WING SUE Well, thank you, Madonna, and welcome Mark. One of the things I do wanna talk about that, uhm, the book, "Counseling the Culturally Different", was what it was called then. It's called "Cultural Counselor", ah, "Counseling Diverse" at this point, but it represented to me, a labor of love, uhm, because in some sense, I think that the book, in many respects, is a reflection of my own racial-cultural awakening. And it was formulated a lot on the basis of many of the lessons I learned as a Asian-American living in, what I considered to be a primarily a monocultural society. I came from a family background of poverty, ah, experiences of, of, ah, discrimination that my brothers, my family and I went through, when my father immigrated to the United States. And it was there that I begin to realize that much of my experiences were different from many of the people around me. In fact, this became very evident to me in, in graduate school when I went to graduate classes and they would talk about the psychology or personality and, while I could understand what they were saying, it did not resonate with my own experience or, uhm, reality. And as a result, that was the jump-off point when I begin to realize that my perception, or world view of this world was different from many of my White classmates. And it was that feeling, I think, that led to a lot of the material that, ah, showed up in "Counseling the Culturally Diverse". 

00:03:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Okay. 

00:03:10
MARK KISELICA Why I, I'm not only wanna respond to your question, but some of the things that Derald said because, ah, you know, a part of me can relate very much to some of your own experiences. We're filming right now in New York City, and I was born not far from here, in Jersey City and raised my early days in Bayonne and, my family was very poor. We were in an immigrant neighborhood. English was our second language. So, there are many similarities and, uhm, later on, I'm gonna talk about how those similarities help me to feel kinship with you after we became friends. I've also, how it's helped me in some respects, to empathize with people of color and their experiences. But, at the same time, I have to admit that, ah, when I approached your book for the first time, ah, I was a graduate student. I wasn't approaching it with any awareness, that I had a sort of a unique cultural perspective, ah, way of looking at the world, where as you grew up understanding that, ah, your roots and your experiences were different from the mainstream population around you. I grew up not really understanding that there was difference. I mean, nothing more than a very fundamental sense and, ah, certainly not the kind that of understanding that, ah, promotes or profounds sensitivity or understanding. Ah, I was sort of raised in a culturally insulated world, primarily Whites. Nice people, caring people, ah, Catholics. But we lived in our own little world. We had very little contact with people who are different from us culturally. And so, I just didn't have much of an awareness beyond this little insulated world in which I've been raised. 

00:05:05
DERALD WING SUE You know, I, I was reading your narrative about your reaction to the book, and one of the reactions you have, uhm, was the initial reaction of being very put off by the book. 

00:05:15
MARK KISELICA Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
DERALD WING SUE And that's one of the issues that I've had to deal with since the publication of the book in 1981. Uhm, I received many email communications and calls and, and letters as well from, ah, some students who have liked it and related to it. In fact, ah, not only just, you know, students of color, but there are White students who really said that their eyes were opened, you know, by the book in terms of what racism, oppression, homophobia was all about as a result of the book. Uhm, there's this slight difference. Students of color tell me when they write, say that, ah, something that you read my mind uhm, that this speaks to my heart, uhm. It's something that I haven't been able to get out. White students, uhm, who have responded positively to it said that they went through a struggle, nevertheless. But I do get, uhm, email messages, uhm, and I call them, characterize them really as hate mail. Ah, In the sense that some people react very negatively to it, accused me about being a racist but of a different color, that I should leave this country if I don't like it and how can I accuse all Whites of being racist or biased, in terms of the writing here. And this is what I find most difficult to crack through, in terms of, uhm, using the book. I've had instructors also write to me, saying that, "You know, can you give me advice about how to deal with the strong emotions I've already elicited by virtue of the content of your book." And I became increasingly aware of this that in some ways, I am pushing powerful buttons in people. 

00:07:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
DERALD WING SUE Powerful, emotional buttons that, that yeah, that really block them from the message and it was there that I begin to try to understand where are the feelings coming from. And reading your narrative, uhm, Mark, I know that you felt very angry at me. Uhm, very similar to some of the reactions that I, ah, had and I've often wonder how you developed in a way that allowed you to hear the message and where did those feelings come from? 

00:07:45
MARK KISELICA Well, I'd be happy to not only explain those feelings but, ah, you know, affirm the reactions that, that you received because I think if, ah, if I had met you when I first read your book, the reaction I would have shared if I had the courage to do so would have been much different from what I wrote to you in 1995 when I first risked sending you a letter about it.(crosstalk) 

00:08:05
DERALD WING SUE Even though I'm such a nice guy? 

00:08:10
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:08:10
 (laughing) 

00:08:10
MARK KISELICA I know you're a nice guy. Ah, but you know, my initial reactions were negative. I, I, ah, as I've mentioned before, I, I was raised in this insulated world and I, I read your book and, ah, especially the first couple, couple of chapters in the first edition of your book. You, you wrote quite a bit about, ah, the history of racism, White racism, what Whites have done to people of color and most specifically, how the mental health system has maltreated people of color. And I took that personally. I got defensive. I, I was angry at you. I thought that you were the one who had a problem and I, I remember thinking, "What's wrong with this guy?" And that's a difficult thing for me to admit to, to you and to Madonna and, and to the people who are gonna be watching this film. It's not easy to admit that. 

00:09:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:09:05
MARK KISELICA Uhm, so, so I am, in some respects, like some of the people who sent you the e-mail. I'd probably would not have sent you an e-mail but these were the thoughts that were going through my mind. I, I was very angry, I was defensive and, ah, fortunately, a number of things happened that helped me to gradually, gradually, ah, not only see the value of your book and the merit of some of the things you were trying to teach us, your readers. But it also sparked for me a, a long journey. That's just been a really wonderful journey for me. 

00:09:40
DERALD WING SUE  Uh-huh. 

00:09:45
MARK KISELICA And I didn't know if you want me to talk about some of that now or, ah. 

00:09:50
DERALD WING SUE Well, I would be interested. I mean, where, where did you say that you felt that the book was, you took it personally. 

00:09:55
MARK KISELICA I did. 

00:09:55
DERALD WING SUE Uhm. 

00:09:55
MARK KISELICA I, I, I, I looked at it this way. I, I sort of, you know, cognitively, I knew that you were writing about some history that had occurred before me. But because you were making such strong statements and accusations about White America, I felt that you're attacking me. And I realized now that that's very illogical. Uhm, in fact, one of the things I've learned about the journey that your book has sparked and kind of set me on was that these, these reactions that people of color may have to a person like me is often for what I represent, not necessarily for me as an individual. 

00:10:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh-huh. 

00:10:40
MARK KISELICA And so, uhm, that has helped me but it took me a long while to even get to that realization. I think what, the, the thing that helped me initially was, ah, I felt so many different emotions happening in me. Once I got beyond the initial reaction of anger and defensiveness that I, I had so many things going on, I wasn't exactly sure what it was I'm experiencing.(crosstalk) 

00:11:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:11:10
MARK KISELICA And so I spent a lot of time reflecting on it, reading those initial chapters over and over again. And one of the things I discovered was that, jeez, you know, the experiences that you've talked about, uhm, and, and, some of your, you had some contributing authors, you talked about the experiences, let's say, of African-Americans, Latinos, and Latinas, where, where in some respect is similar to what my ancestors had gone through. Ah, just to state very briefly, my, my maternal grandparents came from Ireland, they were born in poverty, they had spoken Gaelic, that language have been taken away from the Irish. My grandfather was a marked man. He had been, in some respects, a revolutionary against the oppression and if he didn't leave the country, there was a good chance he would be jailed or die. 

00:12:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:12:05
MARK KISELICA And my other grandparents came from, ah, well, it's now known as Slovakia, it was then known as Czechoslovakia. They, they fled that region after, ah, years of different armies coming in and conquering them and, you know, at one point the whole village had to hide in the woods to live, ah, in order to survive. So, so part of me as, as I try to grapple with these confused emotions I was having, I said: "Jeez, you know, my family went through these things." And although it's not the same historical experience, it's similar. And I felt this sense of obligation to my ancestors to say, I not only owe it to them but I owe it to Derald Wing Sue, to hear what his message is and to hear what these other writers have to say because what if my ancestors' experience was denied? How would I feel? Ah, I might feel as angry as you were. And, and I, I sensed anger in your words, ah, and, and I now can say, legitimate anger. Ah, but initially, I didn't see there's such an anger. I saw there's, ah, sort of an attack on me and I, and I kinda forced myself to move beyond that out of what I owe to my ancestors. And then, then something else happened and it was this, uhm, this feeling of shame. You know, I, I felt ashamed that, ah, that I wasn't aware of this history. I, I felt, in some respects, cheated that, uh, the educational system, in which I had been raised under, I was born in the 50's, and went through grade school in the 60's and then high school in the early 70's. It wasn't 'til the mid-70's that a more informed history about, uhm, the various ways Whites had oppressed people in this country, became aware of it. So I, I felt kind of embarrassed and ashamed that even though my people, so to speak, had not directly done this. And then, then I began to look at myself and I said, "Jeez, in some respects, I am a racist." And, and I used, I, it's even difficult for me to use the words, "I am a racist." you know. It's a hard thing for us, Whites, to use that "r" word. Ah, it was not an easy thing to admit. I, I read about the way people have been treated. I, I started to read other things because of your book. And the more I read, the more I realized, ah, you know, I wasn't the guy out there physically hurting people. I wasn't there in (inaudible ) But somehow, I've learned and internalized stereotypes, told racist jokes. I had used the "n" word when I was a kid. And, ah, when I did it as a kid, I didn't think anything of it. I wouldn't say it in front of adults, because I'd be, you know, I'd be afraid of being punished or embarrassing myself. But in privacy with other boys, I told those kinds of jokes. I laughed at them. So I felt this tremendous sense of shame, and I thought, what am I going to do about it? You know, a part of me just, a part of me wanted to, like, run away. You know, part of me wanted to say, "Well, okay, I read his book. I'll go take the exam I'm studying for, which is why I was reading the book and then I'll be done with it. But, I just couldn't do it. I just... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
MARK KISELICA Just felt that I owe something to my ancestors. Something, something to you even though I don't even know you. Something to people of color. Ah, if I wanted to be truly a better person, a better counselor, I had to do something more. And, and so later on in this interview, I could talk a lot more about things that kept me going. 

00:16:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
MARK KISELICA But, but those were things, it was your book, and then some reflections on them, got me started. 

00:16:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
MARK KISELICA And I, and I am really grateful to you, you know...(crosstalk) 

00:16:20
DERALD WING SUE Well, thank you. I appreciate that. 

00:16:25
MARK KISELICA You know, not, not just for the, the spark but for the fact that we've developed this friendship, where I feel safe enough to tell you about these initial reactions. Because I'm not proud of them. I'm really not. I feel, I feel, in many respects, that I was a clueless person back then. 

00:16:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
MARK KISELICA But I feel it's helped me to grow in, in some respects as I, as I continue to strive to grow. 

00:16:45
DERALD WING SUE So, that's one thing that I really appreciate about you, Mark. I mean, the honesty and genuineness that got very difficult for a lot of my White colleagues, and, and White students to really come to grip with. And I, I do appreciate it. It takes a lot of courage and strength to, to own up to that and make a public statement about it. Uhm, you know, you are right in terms of saying that when you read the book, there is a lot of anger in it. Uhm, there is a lot of anger in it. Uhm, you know, I think that there was some of the anger more in the first edition. I mean, you know, if people feel that these other editions are, are strong, uhm, it was nowhere near the amount of anger I felt, you know, then. I like to think that the book now speaks more with passion and honesty about the pain of oppression. And for some reason, uhm, some people find it very difficult to touch the pain of oppression. And, that's, that's why I'm really interested, how does someone develop in the way that you developed? How do you, you know, I feel people who tell me that they come from conditions of poverty themselves. I've shared this with you. Well, that they, their family have been discriminated against or they've been the victim of stereotyping. Uhm, but that doesn't seem to make it easier for them to be empathic. Uhm, do you know what I'm saying? I mean, it, I know you come from a background of poverty like I do. I know a lot of other people who come from poverty, but it does not allow them to deal, uh, or understand the pain of racism. Your understanding seems to bridge and the other type of, of presentation seems to be dismissal or negating of the pain of oppression that comes from racism. 

00:19:00
MARK KISELICA It, it, it's a very good question and I, I think that, ah, in spite of the fact that I was raised with, with, ah, you know, a culture that, that taught me some harmful things, and I, and I repeated those lessons. On the other hand, the particular culture that I was raised, I think, imbued me with some decent values. For example, ah, in our Catholic community, one of the things we were taught was to be a compassionate person. And, ah, if you do make a mistake, you make amends for it. So, so when I read your book, I realized, my God, you know, I made a big mistake here and I have to do something about it. So, I am very grateful to my roots for, for teaching me that kind of value system. But, what also helped me, you know, there, there are several things I could talk about. I'll mention just two now. Uh, 'coz I, I sense we're developing a nice back and forth here and I, I'd like to, have that continue. So, I'll keep it to two, but one was that, uhm, after I read your book and I got over my anger and I figured out that I, I am a racist and if, if I want to be a good counselor, I have to do something different. I have to, I have to learn in a way that I've never forced myself to learn before. So, I intentionally applied for an internship in Newark, New Jersey at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Now, that's a community mental health center and I was working, ah, in an outpatient center located in the heart of Newark, New Jersey, which is, which was at the time, primarily African-American and, ah, Hispanic families. And I, I can't tell you how much that helped me. Because, it, it provided me with an immersion experience that I never had before. I mean, here I was, I mean, look at me, I'm about as white as a White person can look, right? You know, here I was this blond-haired, blue- eyed guy with the background that I just described. And I went to work in Newark. I was surrounded by people who were different from me. And there's something so beautiful about that. Ah, I, I experienced people and things that I never experienced before. It, it, it was just wonderful. Uhm, you know, for the first time in my life, I hear an African-American choir live. And, ah, being the stranger going into a community where I was clearly an outsider in so many respects and being welcomed. Ah, being invited to go to that church. That did something to my heart. Ah, it, it made me realize that, ah, I had missed out on so much of what's important to life. I was discovering things that were beautiful in other people. And when you do that, it just inspires you to want to find more. Ah, it's a blessing. 

00:22:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
MARK KISELICA And, and in addition to that, at the same time, my supervisors were very empathic people. And that's just been such a great lesson. I mean, that, uhm, you know, in spite of the fact that I had these, you know, these racist strains to me, they, they weren't blatant but they were there. Ah, and in spite of the fact that, ah, I'm still learning quite a bit. I had supervisors, for example, Cheryl Thompson, who's now in Seton Hall University. She was a faculty member there. She, she just had such, such a relaxed, uhm, empathic style where she sort of made it safe for me to reveal things that I'm struggling within. She empathized with me. Here is an African-American woman. She wouldn't(ph) marry(ph) me... (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
MARK KISELICA ...the White guy. Ah, and then when I left UMDNJ, uhm, over the years as I, as I took more risk and I wrote to people like you, I, I wrote you a letter finally in 1995. You picked up the phone and you called me. I, I will never forget that day. You get so many letters, I mean, as you mentioned that is the most widely used textbook in the nation on multicultural counseling. And you took the time, you saw some potential in me. And you said, I'm gonna call this guy and affirm him. And, and I'll just say one other person, Don Locke, ah, as, as I became involved in the American Counseling Association. Here is another person of color who, who became my buddy. I mean, it, it wasn't just that he, he was interested in, ah, helping a White guy become more sensitive. He became my friend. And in the process of that, he was able to empathize with, with my struggle. So, empathy begets empathy. 

00:24:05
DERALD WING SUE  Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
MARK KISELICA And, and I, I owe a great deal of thanks to you and so many other people who, who mentored me. 

00:24:15
DERALD WING SUE Hmm. 

00:24:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Think, as I think about, ah, some of my experiences with your book, Dr. Sue and, uhm, just some of the reactions that I've, I've noted the students to have with regard to reading the book. Just wondering if the two of you could discuss some common reactions, defense mechanisms that you may have noticed with regard to students and courses that you've taught, and how you've dealt with that, how you've helped them to kind of work through some of those, those barriers or issues? 

00:24:45
DERALD WING SUE Well, you know, first of all, the thing that I've noticed more than anything else is the strong emotional reactions that students have. And it ranges us all the way from some of the emotional reactions that Mark has talked about in terms of ah, anger, guilt, ah, shame, defensiveness, ah, anxiety, lots of anxiety about what is appropriate to say in the course or, or not. I come from, you know, a feeling that, uhm, you need to get the students or anyone in the workshop to, to feel, to express their feelings. To cut off the feelings level, ah, is an impediment to, to development. So one of the things I think that, uhm, we need to do as, ah, instructors is to allow the students to have those feelings and to validate the feelings as very important to have. Also to, I've already said that, to communicate to them that, uhm, it takes courage to deal with this topic. And courage is not when one feels safe. Courage is when people feel unsafe and that's why, uhm, I described what you're talking about, Mark, is courage. It's courageous, I mean, very few people that I know that if I was to, uhm, in a class telling 'em, well, what are the findings that we have on what lowers or, uhm, ah, racism. One of them is going outside having contacting experiences with people who are different than you. Well, very few pe-, students would take it on their own to seek out an internship that had, uhm, you know, uh, in fact, we have in California where I used to come, uhm, we had to force some to go to a, ah, internship that had 25 percent, ah, clients different from themselves. Ah, and this was a legal requirement, ah, under the state. But Mark, you did it on your own and the greatest fear I have with all the students who go through the training program is to get them to realize that understanding, uhm, bias in your own racial, cultural identity is just not an intellectual process. It is affective behavioral, emotive, uhm, that are all, and unless they integrate all of that, they may go away from the classroom with a lot of knowledge about different ethnic, uhm, uh, groups or, or gender issues, sexual orientation issues. They have the intellectual understanding but not the emotional or behavioral development that goes with it. And that's why I don't see people involved in, uhm, antiracism activities often. Despite the fact that they may get straight A's in the content of a Social Justice course, or Multicultural Counseling course, they don't change anything significantly because the behavioral and emotional development doesn't occur. So, the whole issue is how we get them to integrate all of those levels. Uhm, and that's what I think the focus of uhm, multicultural training is all about. That when other professors write to me and say what suggestions that you have, uhm, to get the students to understand what the book is all about? Ah, I always said back to them that this is not content, it's just not getting up and lecturing and testing. You almost, as a professor or instructor, have to be a group therapist to deal with the process of the emotions that are occurring in the classroom and not to get your own buttons pushed. Ah, the, and you have to have work through your own, ah, biases and prejudices, uhm, so that you don't wind up wanting to hurt someone... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
DERALD WING SUE who is ah, ah, you know, expressing... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
DERALD WING SUE ...who is ah, ah, you know, expressing... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
DERALD WING SUE A viewpoint that is different. But to understand where that viewpoint is coming from. But those were some of the things that, uh, I've learned. And this couldn't have good teaching assistants... (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
DERALD WING SUE ...who can serve as a gate, scapegoat for the anger of... (laughing) 

00:29:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE (laughing) 

00:29:10
DERALD WING SUE ...directed towards you but it's hard to get it to me. So they do it to, to the ah, ah, TA's. 

00:29:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
MARK KISELICA  Yeah, I agree with so much of what you said, ah, Derald, uhm, I'm going to echo it and, and maybe, ah, expand on it a little bit. You talked about the importance of creating an atmosphere where students are encouraged to, ah, express their feelings, identify them, try to process them. And so I think a key getting back to Madonna's que, ah, question about how do you help students in a classroom is to create an environment where the conditions are set where students feel it is safe to some extent to state what you feel. You know that ah, that you have a right to express what you're going through with relation to this. And, and try to do it in a way that's respectful to other people but allows you to, to ventilating and get a handle of, of what your own experience is. At the same time, uhm, you know, one of the, one of the key successful features of your book is that it's provocative and confrontive. So, so what I, what I've learned is that there has to be this balance between, in the one hand, ah, empathy and support challenging confrontation. You know, on the one hand, ah, sort of, ah, you know, your book was almost like a, like a slap to me, like it woke me up. I, I described in, in my, uh, you know, my section of our chapter we wrote together, it's almost like having a... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
DERALD WING SUE (inaudible ) 

00:30:55
MARK KISELICA ...a bucket of cold water tossed on me. It really woke me up. Then and I, I think that's a good thing but, ah, that has to be followed in by somebody who, who I think, in a non-judgmental way, understands the struggle of the individual, that he or she is going through, and I, and I think it's easier for me as a White person to talk about, ah, not reacting as strongly when a student is having a reaction, you know, because I haven't had that historical experience that he had. I mean, I, I was thinking before you were saying about the first edition of your book was stronger. There was, there was more anger there than the later editions and having read your essay now, I'm not surprised at all why that's the case. I mean, for years, you pushed the establishment to try and publish articles and books that dealt with cultural issues. And those efforts were denied, dismissed, minimized. Uhm, or, or you were told things just to make you feel good but people didn't genuinely believe it. So, I can imagine, uh, how legitimate your anger was by the time you finally got the book out, you know, and whereas in your fourth edition, those battles are behind you a little bit. What is my point through all these? I, I try to imagine what it's like for a person of color to walk into a classroom and have to deal with a White person like me, who maybe for the first time, having his or her encounter experience. And, and that's, that's what I view your book to, to, to have been for me. It was a beginning of my encounter experience. 

00:32:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:32:35
MARK KISELICA In terms of White racial identity development that it, it forced me to take a look at things that I didn't look at before and I, I think it's very easy to be a White person and be empathic to a, to another White person. Ah, I, I, I can imagine it might be difficult for a person of color that, if I'm struggling with what I'm going through as a White person and I'm doing it in a way that's sort of thinking out loud, I may push buttons for a person of color. That's tough to deal with. (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:33:05
MARK KISELICA And ah, what I, what I appreciate about you and Don Locke, and, and the, the other people that I mentioned is that, uhm, you somehow recognized that this was something I had to go through and just as I eventually reached the point, that I didn't try to take it personally when I would see criticisms of White America. I think you've learned, too, on your on development, not to take it personally when you see a White person like me struggling with my racism. And that takes a lot of courage, too. You know, I very much appreciate that and I can understand why that might not be easy. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
MARK KISELICA  You know, you and I were talking in, privately before I, I, think that, ah, ah, anybody who teaches this course, and I think particularly if, if the professor happens to be a person of color with a classroom of White, largely White students, may need the support of other colleagues. And, and maybe some supervision and consultation... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
MARK KISELICA ...for how to deal with his or her feelings... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:34:05
MARK KISELICA ...which you'll start off, listening to the students' reactions. 

00:34:10
DERALD WING SUE Mark, you are right, in the sense that, uhm, there has been an evolution in terms of, of my own, uh, thinking that has created, I think major changes in, in outlook. Uhm, the fir, the first saying I, one of the most important changes in the way I view the issue of oppression and discrimination is a realization that we are all socialized into a highly racist, sexist, homophobic, uh, uh, society and culture, and that we took on, it's possible for any of us being born and raised in the United States, not to be culturally conditioned to these, uhm, biases. So, I had to recognize that I, too, have stereotypes and biases of, of, ah, various racial, ah, ethnic groups. And that realization, ah, brought me to the, ah, to the conclusion that, that, uhm, not only am I victimized in this society, but many, that White people are also victimized by the process of, of cultural conditioning. And that the anger I feel is not so much, uhm, anger at white people. It's at the anger of the White supremacy, uhm, ah, cultural conditioning that we go towards, so that White people to me, as someone on, on the (inaudible ) here said, are not the enemy. It's White supremacy or the biases that, uhm, are instilled in all of us. And the second realization, is that I do experience almost all groups, any group that I deal with, individuals, to be good, decent individuals. And they, you know, and this is where I suddenly realized, there's a difference between their conscious world view and the unconscious cultural conditioning that they, ah, go through. Their conscious belief is that they are moral individuals, they would never discriminate, they would find it very difficult to suddenly realize that they, ah, discriminated against other people. But the unconscious cultural conditioning is invisible, so that in essence, uhm, unless they tap into that, they can be quite harmful and detrimental, uhm, ah, to individuals around them. Not just a, a, a White employer, ah, but white counselors and therapists who have not come to realize the unconscious biases that they have can, inadvertently, and unintentionally harm and oppress clients of color, that there are communities of color, that they're, ah, working with. So it's not something they, they consciously endeavor, that deliberately want to do but it is really, ah, an invisible veil that we are fighting and I see you as an ally. I see, uhm, Alan Ivy as an ally, ah, Don Locke as an ally, Madonna, we're all allies in this, ah, attempt to throw off this invisible veil. But throwing off the invisible veil challenges a racial reality of White America. And that when you challenge a racial reality, of which so much structure are built in your own identity, how society operates, ah, is a threat and it may not be a conscious threat but it's a threat to who you are, ah, and your own self-image. And I find that is the major barrier in working with individuals to understand themselves as racial-cultural beings, is to fight the battle of their racial reality, not that it's wrong or completely, uhm, inaccurate, but that it does not allow them to actually see the world of, let's say, racism, as it really is. You know that movie, The Matrix?... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
MARK KISELICA Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
DERALD WING SUE You know, you're, you're living in this sense of denial in a false world and what happens if you see the world as it really is? And, uhm, the world that people come and go through is a world that is not very pleasant, when, ah, when White people begin to see it from our perspective. And when I walk, talk and, uhm, write about what the police did to my son, when I write about uhm, what, we, what happened to us when we were young, being teased by White gangs and my brother being forced to fight. Ah, when everyday of my life, there are what I call micro-aggressions, that well-intentioned people deliver, uhm, that I cope with. They're minor and trivial, but they're accumulative. And it's really difficult for, uhm, for my White brothers and sisters to see that. For them to, for me to tell them about it and not for them to say, "Derald, why are you always making such a big thing of this?" They don't see that, how impactful this is for, ah, individuals of color nor do they, if they don't see that, they don't acknowledge how strong people of color, gay, lesbians, women have to be to survive and function, I think, in this society and culture. Uhm, but those are things that I think that is so difficult to reach, you know, ah, my students in talking about. It creates arguments, conflicts, uhm, and you know. (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Difficult dialogue. 

00:40:00
DERALD WING SUE Yeah, yeah, really, just strong dialogues are... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hm. 

00:40:05
DERALD WING SUE ...difficult to do. 

00:40:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
MARK KISELICA You know, ah, I, I, you mentioned, uh, some, some historical experiences and how, how we, as Whites, had trouble understanding how the cumulative effect of these things is just so overwhelming at times. And I was talking before about how certain factors helped me to, to understand that a little bit. One of them is, is, uhm, just reading. Ah, I have found that, the more and more I've read about the subject, the more it's helped me to understand about history I wasn't aware before. And the more I go to events that are a cross-cultural boundaries that are put together by, ah, people of color or the combination of Whites and people of color that I get exposed to individuals talking about their experiences that help me to understand it better. I just want to give one example. Uhm, I'm involved in this organization called The No Place for Hate Campaign in Newtown, Pennsylvania where I live. We brought in a speaker, who's, ah, an historian of, ah, he's a biographer of Harriet Tubman. And he told us these, these, these stories about how, ah, how much she went through in her life, which I had, I had a, you know, a pretty good understanding about before I heard this man speak. But he went into more detail about the conditions under which she ran the Underground Railroad and, uhm, just how, how much it hurt her to see so many people treated horribly and then later in life she finally was a free person herself. Toward the end of her life, somebody went up to her and said, uhm, "Do you hate White people?" And her response was almost exactly what she, what you just said. She said, you know, "I'm tired from all of these hatred. It's hurt me. It's hurt my people." She said, "See that little girl over there?" And apparently, there was a, a girl whose coloring looks like mine, she was a blond hair, blue-eyed little girl. She said, "Take a look at that little girl." She said, "That child wasn't born with hate. That child doesn't know who I am and doesn't hate me for the color of my skin. You give her time, she will. So, that's what I hate. That's what I, that's what people need to fight." This historian was saying that. I can't tell you the hope that that gave me. That Harriet Tubman would actually witness the slavery, have been a slave herself, had, had to go through swamps and the threat of being killed at any minute for what she was trying to do. Could see things that complexly and she saw, at the same time, the purity of that little girl and the hope in her. There's something very healing about that and very inspirational. When you experienced a person like that who, can look at things complexly and with kindness and generosity, it makes you want to do more. 

00:43:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  When I think about that story and some of the things that that you all are talking about earlier, I think about the different levels that people can be with regard to cultural competence in terms of affectively and, uhm, intellectually and even behaviorally. And I know that you spoke earlier, Dr. Kiselica, about, uhm, some of your feelings of ambivalence about kind of doing the work it takes to be culturally competent, and just kind of when people are different places, affectively, behaviorally, and, ah, intellectually with regard to issues of cultural diversity and so forth, how do you help them to pull those things together so that they are kind of more in the same place with regard to, to these issues? Any thoughts either of you would have about that? 

00:44:35
DERALD WING SUE Well, I think I would say that it's a life long journey. Uhm, you know, and I, the way I see working, uhm, let's say, with students again, in terms of understanding cultural competence and integrating this, is that, in essence we plant seeds. Uhm, and those seeds, uhm, we are in some sense, you can't get people culturally competent in just one semester cour, ah, classroom, uhm, uhm, experience. But what I say, think is that we try to present an integrated experience, plants seeds and we may not, uhm, see, you know, positive benefits of, of the course itself but I think maybe I'm optimistic. I hope that there would be a series of experiences later, uhm, that they'll go through, and these seeds begin to blossom and, and germinate. Uhm, you know, that's the way I see it because sometimes, you know, if you take a short term view of one course, you're going to be disappointed, uhm, and I don't think you should be. I think that you gotta teach, uhm, honestly, ah, you've got to be authentic in the classroom yourself about the feelings that you have. You've got to be open to admitting your own biases and prejudices, and model that to, uhm, I think the students and I think that is a great deal of, ah, you know, feeling like they are able to also be honest about, uhm, you know, what is happening. But I think this is a life long journey for, uhm, everyone. And I really think that any program that says we're gonna train you to be culturally competent, uhm, isn't going to do it. Uhm, the other thing that I think more, reading books is important, especially if they come from the perspective of, uhm, what I, I hate the term minority authors, because it allows you to understand the world as written from the perspective of that individual. I, I'm not sure that, uhm, books had come from a majority viewpoint are, I know they can be helpful... (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
MARK KISELICA Right. 

00:46:55
DERALD WING SUE ...but not all the time. But I do want to emphasize also and I, I tell the students is that, uhm, that if reading books and going to workshops was the, would make you culturally competent, would eliminate racism, we would have done that a long time ago. And it's the, that in order to be culturally competent, you have to have experiential reality. You have to like you did, go out into the community, some in groups, and they're going to make you really uncomfortable. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
MARK KISELICA Right. And, and that uncomfortableness... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:47:35
MARK KISELICA ...will occur again and again and again. 

00:47:35
MADONA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:47:35
MARK KISELICA You have to be ready to say, this is part of, if I want to be part of the solution, I have to repeatedly accept that this discomfort... (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
MARK KISELICA ...both my own... (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
MADONA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
MARK KISELICA ...and among others. I have to be willing... (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:47:50
MARK KISELICA ...to deal with that. Yeah. 

00:47:50
DERALD WING SUE Yeah, and that's why multi-cultural training in an academic setting alone isn't enough. Uhm, it's truly isn't enough. In fact, sometimes I wonder whether, ah, culturally competent people are born by virtue of the experiences that they've gone through are ready... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
MADONA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
DERALD WING SUE ...or whether we can academically, educationally train them. Uhm, maybe a little bit of both. But I know that the, the students or the professionals who simply rely on workshops become culturally competent won't do that. You've got to socialize with people who are different than you, you gotta play with them, laugh with them, enjoyed and, and if you look at the way our society is segregated, that's what we're fighting with. Because, Mark, you, you know, maybe you're not the person but when I talk to people, they say "Well, I do have Black friends. I do have Asian friends. We work together." Working together is different from socializing together or working as an ally outside of a work setting together. Because in the world of work, your roles are scripted. (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
MADONA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
DERALD WING SUE Uhm. 

00:49:00
MARK KISELICA  Let me affirm what you just said because, ah, you know, if you had met me at age 25 and said, "You're a racist." Or you don't really, you don't really know, uh, people of color because, uh, you haven't had the kind of intimate, real, sort of, soul-bearing kind of conversations like we're having now. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
DERALD WING SUE Uh hm. 

00:49:25
MARK KISELICA I would have said, "Why me? I'm not racist. I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
DERALD WING SUE I know. 

00:49:30
MARK KISELICA ...you can't be telling that about me. I have Black friends, you know. I have, ah, I have a Cuban buddy I play basketball with and, you know, I have Black friends that I play baseball with." And I would have justified that as me being not racist. And, uhm, I agree with you that, uhm, reading is not going to do it. It will only enhance an experiential. 

00:49:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
MARK KISELICA Ah, you're, you're sort of immersing yourself in the other person's experience. I think that's a big help. (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
MARK KISELICA And I wanna go back to, to, ah, something Madonna asked me. She said, ah, you know, "Recognizing that people are in different places, how can we get them, sort of, to the same place." I, I respect so much Dr. Constantine's work on, uhm, so much research on racial identity development. And I find that model very helpful to me now as an instuctor and also looking at myself as a person in my own journey. I mean, the thing I try to keep in mind with students is I say, "Where are they? "Where is he or she in his or her particular journey right now? And what does he or she need?" And then I, and I will reflect on my own experience and I think, okay, there was a time in my life where I have read your book, I would have been completely in the first stage, that I would have been in denial. And I would have written you off. And I would not have gone further than that. I would have attributed the whole problem as being inside you and nothing to do with me 'coz I'm one of the good guys. And fortunately for me, your book was so provocative that it pushed me beyond that. What I needed, at that stage, was somebody to help me figure out my emotions. And I, and I kind of initially did it on my own. Ah, luckily, as I struggled through it, other people would help me and they did it, as you said, with self-disclosure. They did it with acknowledging their own biases, they helped to normalize, to some extent, what I was experiencing. At the same time, provoking me to, you know, "You don't have this all figured out, Mark. There's some stupid things you're still thinking and doing." And that was helpful to me to be prodded along by people cared about me. And then to be able to recognize that there, that there were people who reached a stage where they sort of go, you know, so much in the other direction as a White person over identifying people of color and that they're maybe, ah, an overzealousness that, that, uhm, that has been recognized as a part of what this person is going through, and somehow I have to affirm that they are heading in the right direction, but now tone them down a little bit. And then, and then, ah, I know for me, I reached the stage, which is consistent with the model of racial identity and development, where you sort of retreat for a while and, and try to figure out, okay, I've gone out there and I've been overzealous and I've made some mistakes and I'm getting tired of the emotional draining... (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
MARK KISELICA ...aspect of, uhm, not only crossing cultural boundaries but dealing with the pain of racism. I mean, it's painful. It's painful to, to hear another person talk about his or her, uhm, upsetting and insulting experiences and, and to find something deep within yourself to try and support that person. But as painful, it, it's also painful to the accused of being not, ah, understanding and not being capable... (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
MARK KISELICA ...of being understanding and to say, "Well, maybe some pieces to this criticism are right but maybe some of it isn't." But whether it's right or not, you know, I, I, I have an obligation to say, "Jeez, you're upset." Ah, and, and so the person may need, uhm, somebody to sort of understand and say it's okay to take the time to, to sort of recover or reconstitute yourself. But when you're ready, go back in there. (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
MARK KISELICA You know, do more. And then when you're in the stage of realizing how complex these things are or how difficult they are, as you set to find allies. 

00:53:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:53:50
MARK KISELICA I mean, ah, I not only found people of color who are allies and mentors, but I found lots of Whites, too. And you and I have a mutual friend named Joe Pantoranto(ph). Every year, ah, periodically, Joe and I talk about our respective experience and it's helpful, (inaudible ) and I. 

00:54:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
MARK KISELICA You know, it's helpful to have, have a White friend who, who can understand, as a fellow White, what it's like. 

00:54:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:54:15
MARK KISELICA You, know, the mistakes you're gonna make. Ah, the feeling to retreat, you know, the necessity of moving onward. All of these things, I think, if we put these, these factors in place, we can under, and we can recognize the different stages of the people within. (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:30
MARK KISELICA  Provide the kind of support or response that a person needs at his or her respective stage. We can eventually get more and more people to the same place...(crosstalk) 

00:54:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:54:40
MARK KISELICA ...which, which is what you were asking, (inaudible ) I feel greatly encouraged. 

00:54:46
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:46
MARK KISELICA And I feel, I know you and I are on a symposium a few years ago at the APA Convention and you reflected on the fact that 30 years ago, students didn't wanna learn anything about this. And now you're finding there's a generation of students who've gone through the schools, and I, and I found this, too. They had multicultural education since they were little...(crosstalk) 

00:55:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
MARK KISELICA ...children. My children are having things at school that I never had. And I, I feel so encouraged about that. 

00:55:10
DERALD WING SUE  The fact that, you know, this may be blasphemy that I find some of our, uhm, newer graduates much more culturally aware than, than, uhm, some of my colleagues. 

00:55:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
DERALD WING SUE Not, not including you. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Of course not, of course not. 

00:55:25
MARK KISELICA Yeah. 

00:55:25
DERALD WING SUE  Yeah. 

00:55:30
MARK KISELICA Yeah. And, and you know, how fortunate they, are they that, that, that, that those students have been raised in the era where, ah, it's, it's becoming mainstream part of the education to develop cultural sensitivity. It's encouraging. 

00:55:45
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  We have individuals today who are members of our audience who are here to, to hear the interview of Doctor Sue and Doctor Kiselica. They may have questions about counseling the culturally diverse. So, we'd like to open up this segment of the interview for questions from the audience. Is there anyone who has a question for either Dr. Sue or Dr. Kiselica? 

00:56:10
 Hello. Uhm, my question has to do with, ah, the book in relation to training and racial cultural training that happens in the classroom especially in graduate programs, uhm, Counseling Psychology programs. Uhm, I find that with the book, uhm, it elicited so many emotions. And then when we have these types of courses, uhm, that often times, the White students will have very similar reactions. Well, they become very angry and defensive. The book, and then like what you said, Dr. Sue, how a lot of the students of color will feel the book speaks to them and that sort of thing. Uhm, in my own experience, I find that, uhm, with everyone reading the book that it then leads to a lot of difficult dialogues in the classroom, a lot of, of tense emotions in the room. I mean, there often times that leads to a lot of racial microaggressions, uhm, acting out inside of the classroom and then, and so at least to a similar experience to what might be happening for students outside of the classroom as well. Uhm, I also find that students of color, because they, they experience these racial microaggressions in the classroom and these difficult dialogues, that they then become very angry in the classroom themselves, that their exploration might be limited, uhm, to just exploring anger and, and sitting with the anger. And at often times, instructors don't know how to help facilitate students of color in exploring their own biases as well as their own internalized racism and that sort of thing. So, I wanted to know if, ah, you could just speak to that like any advice you might have for both instructors, as well as, to all students, both to students of colors and to, oh, students of color and to White students on how, uhm, they might deal with some of these difficult dialogues in the classroom. 

00:57:40
DERALD WING SUE  You know, thank you. That's a, a very good question. Ah, I think that the way that it's best handled is that, ah, you cover both White racial identity development and racial cultural ethnic minority identity development. Because I think that what Dr. Kiselica had said earlier was that, uhm, understanding racial cultural identity development allows him to, ah, anticipate where it is that the students are coming from. And that students of color oftentimes do feel left out that this is primarily a training for a White, ah, counselor trainees, and I think the instructor does have to retell and begin to cover and attune into what is going on with students of color as well. Uhm, the other thing I guess I would say is that, uhm, that it is important to recognize that all of us have biases, prejudices, and stereotypes. And one of the issues that I sometimes cope with, with, ah, students of color is that this is all what happened to me. I know this. Uhm, and I try to, uhm, get them to realize that they are not free from inheriting, ah, biases between ethnic groups as well. In the conversation I had, uhm, just had here, one of the things that we didn't, ah, you know, I stressed was that White people inherit the racial biases of their ancestors. Well, I also indicated that people of color are socialized into a highly racist environment so that I, too, have, ah, biases and stereotypes directed towards African-Americans, and maybe even other Asians and as well as, ah, as White Americans. Because looking at Mark, when I first saw Mark, he fit all the epitome of the White, ah, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, attractive, I mean, you know, almost the flashes of the Aryan race. And if I operated from that stereotype, I would have dismissed him as having any racial, cultural, uhm, sensitivity. But it is very difficult to, when you have two different tracks going on to relate to the, uhm, ah, experiential reality and needs of students of color and those of, of White students as well. But, ah, it has to be done. But, uhm, that students of color also have a need to understand, ah, them own selves and in terms of relationship to other groups. 

01:00:25
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
MARK KISELICA I, I really appreciate the question, too. And I, I'm going to respond more from the experience of, uhm, I've, I've been in situations where the people of color are, in terms of numbers, minorities in the classroom. And the professor, in my opinion, has a tremendous obligation when you have that situation because you may have, ah, one, two, or just a handful of people of color trying to describe their experience and either have it attacked or not affirmed by White students, with the same time may be feeling that, uhm, it, it, too much support is given to the people of color then my experience in, in my anger and the things that I need to process aren't honored. So I, I think the professor has an important, uhm, obligation to reach all the different sides that emerged toward an argument and that important preventive work can occur, ah, even before the difficult discussions are attempted to be undertaken. For example, if a professor sees that there is just one, two, or three students of color in the room, he or she can approach the students early in the semester and say, "May I speak with you in privacy? I recognize we're going to talk about difficult issues in here. One of the things I've noticed when this happens is that you may feel that you're put on the spot. You may feel that you're being forced to speak for your people. Ah, you, you may feel that, uhm, Whites are going to respond in a way that, uhm, really doesn't understand your historical experience. So I wanna know, I wanna know when and if you ever experience that and that I'm ready to try and, ah, speak from multiple historical experiences even though I can't completely do that. But I don't want you, in other words, I don't want you to feel that you have to take everything on. Tell me how uncomfortable you are speaking in my class. What support do you need? How often do you want me to speak up? Uhm, are there signals we can give each other if you are feeling frustrated? Ah, do, can you sense that you can approach me at any time when you're feeling unsafe in the class?" In that way, uhm, history doesn't repeat itself in the classroom. At, at the same time, ah, I think a White professor has to be careful not to go too far in the direction of trying to support and overidentify with students of color to sort of prove that he or she is not racist. And, and so, so, you know, that's, that's where I feel my job is to respond in an empathic way and say, "You know, I can understand your anger toward this book. Tell me about your anger. Why do you feel that Dr. Sue is talking to you? Where, where is it coming through? You know, where is that, where is that coming from? Uhm, tell me, tell me about your, your family's experiences. Why do you think you're not racist? In what ways do you think you might be racist that you can't see?" And, and I've written many, uhm, articles about my own experiences, trying, trying to overcome my own blinders. So I give that to my White students and say, "Read this and tell me what you think." I guess the last thing you wanna say is, "I want you to know that I recognize this is never easy. No matter what answer I give you, uhm, it, it, you know, if I were to incorporate everything that Dr. Sue said about all his suggestions in life, it's still not easy. It's, it, the nature of this kind of education in light of the historical, ah, realities, make this difficult work." 

01:04:30
DERALD WING SUE You know, one of the things and all that, that I think is important here is that there is a major difference between a White instructor teaching a multicultural course and a, ah, instructor of color. Even with the instructors of color, I think that the way I teach it and my impact will be far different from, ah, Professor Constantine's impact, ah, as a Black woman. And gender also affects it. So that part of it really is understanding. I think, ah, the instructor's understanding, how they are likely to call different things from students. 

01:05:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:05:10
DERALD WING SUE And, you, you weren't aware of this but before we even started the taping to indicate to you, uhm, uhm, how aware, uhm, Dr. Kiselica was about his social impact as a White male. He said to me directly that I don't think, ah, that, can I suggest that when we start this session that, ah, you start rather than I. Uhm, and I think that a lot people or that, uhm, you know, Professor Constantine would start. I think a lot of people would, uhm, not understand that. But the issue is that Dr. Kiselica understands that one of the things that happens in our society is that White people always speak up first, and are in the position of authority and power. And what he did was that he did not want to perpetuate and replay as he said history, of the dominant subordination of, that, that goes on. So, the, the impact that professors have, uhm, and that, that we, I would give is that be aware of how you impact students and, uhm, students of color, White students, and others, by virtue of who you are as a, uhm, as a, ah, racial cultural, uhm, ah, individual. Lastly, and I don't mean to, ah, you mentioned earlier this issue of microaggressions. Now, a lot of people, uhm, might have difficulty understanding, ah, what this, uhm, microaggression, sort of a daily insults everyday indignities that people of color, that women, that gay, lesbians go through that are perpetuated by well-intentioned individuals who do not know that they have made a statement, behaved in a, a way, as to invalidate and insult the, you know, uhm, a, a student of color. And, ah, when this occurs in the classroom, if the training, ah, is at that level, I think that this is a prime example, ah, to use in terms of really what is going on that creates a difficult dialogue and what must be done to do it. And, ah, for those of you who still might find this difficult to, to grasp. Uhm, you know, when a person comes up to me, I give this example and ask me, where were you born? And I'll say, uhm, I was born in Portland, Oregon. No, no, no, where were you born? And I'll say, ah, Portland, Oregon? And they'll say, no, no, no, what country were you born in? I'll say the United States. They, you know, and then they are very embarrassed with that answer. What, the message that to me represents a micro-aggression that many people may trivialize. But the micro-aggression doesn't come from the fact that this isn't a decent individual who is showing interest in you. But the hidden message in the micro-aggression to me is that I'm an alien in my own country. It's the same thing when people say to me, if you don't like it here, go back to China. Well, this is my country not China. And so, ah, when those situations occur, those are right situations where a good facilitator to point out what is going on in, in this, uhm, ah, dialogue. 

01:08:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. Are there other questions? 

01:08:40
  First, I would like to say thank you for your courage and honesty. Ah, my question is in relations to, in regards to students who may feel that because they're not gonna counsel culturally diverse clients that this journey is worth it. The book and the class often elicits a lot of strong emotions. And when they get to that struggle, they will choose say, well, I'm not gonna counsel... (crosstalk) 

01:09:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

01:09:05
 ...people who are different than me. How do you motivate those students who take this journey? 

01:09:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Great question. Uh hmm. 

01:09:10
MARK KISELICA I have a couple thoughts on that. (crosstalk) 

01:09:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:09:15
MARK KISELICA I, I think we have an obligation in our missions process. Ah, first, it's an excellent question. Uhm, we have an obligation in our missions process to try and figure out ways to admit students who are, who value cross and cultural boundaries uhm, who value ah, trying to serve communities that maybe underserved. The, they're, a, as, as you well know there's a social justice philosophy in counseling. Ah, that philosophy demands us to, I think, I'm gonna talk now as a professor, to think of with the research I do and the writing I do, uhm, how can I somehow make a difference with regard to some pressing social issue? And, and when I think about that I think that, that kind of challenge extends to what we do with our students. We have to figure out ways in our mission criteria to identify students who value multiculturalism and that's not going to perfectly weed out, uhm, everybody shouldn't be there and it's not going to perfectly attract everybody we want here. (crosstalk) 

01:10:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:10:35
MARK KISELICA And so then we have an obligation with the students we have to provide some sort of encounter experience that, you know, as you said you, you mentioned your students will get there and say, well I'm not gonna work... (crosstalk) 

01:10:50
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:10:50
MARK KISELICA ...with the culturally different, so why do I have to bother? And I, I think, we as instructors, have to try and figure out creative ways to help them to look at it and to see maybe I should work with people who are different from me. One way to do that is to use your textbook. (crosstalk) 

01:11:10
DERALD WING SUE I agree with you, Mark. 

01:11:10
MARK KISELICA But, then, you know, you know, but the text, but the textbook, you know, that's, that's not going to work with every student. And, and I do think that, uhm, there comes a point, ah, in programs where, ah, the faculty have to get together and perhaps have, uhm, a retention meeting with students who aren't committed to this. Ah, and, and that's, that's a very serious step to take. And, and I think, I think it's, it's, it's probably a last resort. But eventually there maybe students, if they have an attitude, well, what difference does it make? I have a question as to whether or not those students are suitable to be counselors. And, and it's, it's tough, it's tough legally to, to, to, to take, uhm, ah, probably very definitive steps with a student like that, since you're removing a student from the program. But I do think something as formal as a retention meeting, that's a very powerful message. It's giving the student a systemic message, right? Not just one professor but a whole department, a chair and several senior faculty members who say, I'm here to stay in this department and I value this and we value this and we're collectively telling you, we have a problem with, with your attitude about this. And, and I can say those things have to be done privately out of respect for the student's, uhm, personal record. But those things have happened. And, and they do have an impact when, when a student is given a systemic message. 

01:12:50
DERALD WING SUE See, I think also that, uhm, there are several things that I think about. One of them is at the most recent uhm, ah, multicultural guidelines in the APA and all the, ah, new standards and guidelines on cultural competence that are, ah, that's part of the definition now of what we consider to be cultural, ah, to be ah, good counseling. Cultural competence is a criteria that we use. The other thing is that, uhm, to students who say that it would mean that they would deal with a very limited, small clientele in light of the increasing demographics. It's gonna be impossible for any of them to go out in the world and not work with individual who differ themself, from them in terms of race, culture, ethnicity. In fact, if we look at it globally, ah, if we're talking about the primarily White Americans it means your clientele is very limited. Ah, the third thing is that I do think we have a moral, ethical obligations to try to reach them. Uhm, reaching them may not be at, uh, the graduate level, but I think that if our society is truly to move into a multicultural, uh, become multicultural, it has to do it at the K through 12 level. That is the only, those are the only, ah, years in which we have access that they're amended, mandated to go through education. And if education is truly multicultural, I think that we are taking a preventive action rather than afterwards what we're dealing with uhm, remediation. They're here before us and now we've got to change, uhm, uh, everything, ah, about them. But, uhm, it used to be much more problematic what you're raising than it, uhm, it, as of the present time. But interestingly, you know that Teacher's College is under some criticism for the social, uhm, uh justice mission that it states that we're force feeding, uh, we, you're forcing our students and, and the entire college not just in counseling clinical and they're raising objections to the fact that we have this agenda that we're forcing uh, uh, all students who go through the program to accept. Ah, and that's where the difficulty sometimes, ah, you know, comes in. 

01:15:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. We believe we have time for one more question? Yes. 

01:15:25
 Well, first I wanna say thank you to Dr. Kiselica and Dr. Sue for sharing you thoughts and experiences, ah, with us. And thank you for Dr. Constantine for facilitating this dialogue. Ah, my question is regarding students who have, you know, essentially kind of bought into cultural competence, feel it's very important, have committed themselves to working on from personal journey or self-exploration, understanding their biases and assumptions and so on, but who go to their site, their field work site, ah, who or maybe who just graduated and find that the environment in which they're working in, ah, for example supervisors, colleagues, perhaps policies and practices ei-, either at college counseling center for example, community mental health or hospital actually are not, you know, in accord with the student's training... (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

01:16:15
 ...but who maybe not very confident. What advice would you give to the student who actually encountered such an environment? And... (crosstalk) 

01:16:20
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE And who in fact what would be evaluated by the supervisors that at the site... (crosstalk) 

01:16:25
DERALD WING SUE Yeah, yeah. 

01:16:25
 Right. Yes. (crosstalk) 

01:16:25
DERALD WING SUE This is where, uhm, I really believe that, uhm, we have to prepare our students to be, uhm, advocates as well. To understand organizational, ah, dynamics because I think you're pointing on something that, ah, I've been very much involved in. That cultural competence not only has to happen at the individual level but at the professional, organizational and societal level. And, ah, this is increasingly becoming very clear to us, in the sense that, we train our students to be culturally competent or to show cultural competence. And then they go out to the school districts, to the mental health agencies, uhm, human resource departments, uhm, and the organizations punish them for exhibiting that cultural competence. (crosstalk) 

01:17:15
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:17:15
DERALD WING SUE I mean it doesn't make sense to me. And indeed, it does happen. And so, what increasing the, what I'm trying to do is arm the students to understand that the programs, policies and practices of an organization represent an entity almost like a client that you have to be able to begin to change. You don't go in there and, and, you know, thrash away because, as an individual, you don't have the power to do it. You've gotta find alliances, you've gotta understand organizational change, dynamics and you've got to be able to, ah, uhm, make changes in that organizational, ah, system. Ah, it may not be particularly, uhm, helpful immediately to a student, coming in and out, to have the students come back who are really burned out, ah, you know, because what they've been taught to be cultural competence, went against the very standards of professional practice. And they were, ah, ah, told that they needed, you know, uh, more training in professional behavior. And that is a conflict, I think, that we're confronting head on now, ah, with both the American Psychological Association and the American Counseling Association. And, uhm, ah, of course, uhm, there's so much work to be done in this. I mean, that's why we need organizational change agents. 

01:18:40
MARK KISELICA  I, I agree and, ah, I, I have one, if, if I could suggest one very insightful reading. It's a simple, wonderful narrative that, that illustrates everything that, that Dr. Sue just said. Uhm, it's written by an, a man named Zander Ponzo... (crosstalk) 

01:19:05
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

01:19:05
MARK KISELICA ...who is now retired. 

01:19:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh-hmm. 

01:19:10
MARK KISELICA And I, I had the pleasure of meeting Zander for the first time about two years ago. He's retired. He was a professor at the University of Vermont. And I don't remember the exact title of his article but it was something like the counselor as change agent. He wrote about this experience he had being an idealistic, socially justice-oriented counselor who went in this high school where it did not want to change. (crosstalk) 

01:19:35
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Hmm. 

01:19:35
MARK KISELICA He said, they had their rules, they had their system and they were well fortified. And he basically became, on his own, a sacrificial lamb. Uh, he talks about the hard knocks of that experience and the lessons he learned. One of which was, as you said on the one hand you have to press the system to change but on the other hand you have to realize the power of that institution. And al-although it's the, not the same particular challenge, Norman Gysbers has written for years about, uh, the transforming school counseling systems. His work is beautiful because one of the important lessons from his work that I learned is that, when counselor succeed in transforming systems, it usually takes about four years of concer, not only concerted effort but and effort of a team of... (crosstalk) 

01:20:40
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

01:20:40
MARK KISELICA ...caring people who have to develop a power base behind them. So, so getting back to your question about an intern, I, I think that, ah, that an intern has to take small steps, rely on the support and supervision of his or her faculty member back here. Try to think realistically, what can I do and what can I do and if I'm going to stay here beyond the internship, how, what are some mechanisms overtime that I can use to try and change this system? 

01:21:05
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. We thank you all very much for your participation and your attendance. And we thank you also for watching the interview and wish you the best in your journey. We thank Doctors Mark Kiselica and Derald Wing Sue for sharing their innermost thoughts and feelings about issues of oppression, discrimination and racism. And we encourage all viewers to engage in an honest dialogue with one another about these issues. It's not easy for any of us to explore our biases and prejudices about different groups in our society. As you know, this videotape was meant to accompany Dr. Sue's book, "Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice" in which both Doctors Kiselica and Sue present narratives related to their own racial, cultural awakening and the pain that goes with such an honest examination. However, this video can be used alone as well. Both Doctors Kiselica and Sue experienced a wide range of emotions as they journeyed on the path of self-examination and awareness. If you have viewed this video as a class or even individually, it may be very educational to share your reactions and emotions with one another or others. As Doctor Kiselica indicated, in order to become a culturally competent helping professional, he struggled long and hard with very strong feelings of anger, defensiveness and sadness. In the case of Doctor Sue, his own experiences of oppression form much of the basis of his own anger toward racism and ultimately influenced the content of his book. Some questions we would like you to ponder as we come to a close involve the following. 

01:23:10
Questions To Ponder: Self-Examination 

01:23:10
MADONNA G. CONSTANTINE What initial emotions were experienced by Dr. Kiselica upon reading Dr. Sue's book? Why did he react in such a manner? What does he attribute his emotions of anger, guilt, defensiveness and sadness to? How did he resolve these feelings and what uncomfortable meaning did they have for him? How did you feel as you listened to the stories of these two men? The content of multiculturalism, racism and oppression often arouse very deep feelings of anger and anxiety in many of us. If you are experiencing a strong reaction now, don't deny it or leave it unexamined. These nested or embedded emotions, often associated with race and racism, block our ability to hear the voices of those most oppressed and disempowered. When Dr. Sue states that "White people are not the enemy but White Racism is," what did he mean? Dr. Kiselica courageously stated that he had to come to grips with the disturbing fact that he was a racist. Do you think it's possible for any of us to be born and raised in the United States and be immune from inheriting racial biases and prejudices? What does this mean for you as a racial cultural being? In viewing this tape and reading the text, what have you learned about yourself that may have implications for your role and ability to work with culturally diverse clients? Which traits do you bring to the helping relationship? What limitations or biases might hinder your work with culturally diverse clients? What you have heard in the conversation between Doctors Kiselica and Sue often challenges viewers' world views and exposes unpleasant realities about each and everyone of us. It's not easy to realize that we all possess racist, sexist or homophobic attitudes toward others. Yet, I ask that you not turn away and deny that these feelings or attitudes exist. Becoming culturally competent in mental health practice demands that nested or embedded emotions associated with race, culture, gender and other important socio-demographic differences be openly experienced and discussed. It is these intense feelings that often block our ability to hear the voices of those of our clients. How we, as helping professionals, deal with these strong feelings can either enhance or negate a deeper understanding of ourselves as racial cultural beings, allow us to become culturally competent in mental health practice and begin steps to work understanding the world views of culturally diverse clients.
