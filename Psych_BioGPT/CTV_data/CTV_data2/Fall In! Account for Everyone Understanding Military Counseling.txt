THERAPY Talks

CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Hello. I'm glad you're taking the time to look at this particular talk because it's very very important. You know military service is a very proud thing. As you heard in the introduction, I am a 20 year veteran myself. I joined the army many many years ago. It seems like the years get going by a lot faster now. I was just 17 years old when I woke up one Saturday afternoon and chose to walk about a mile or so to a recruiting station down the road and make the commitment to sign my name on a dotted line and to go off into service. As I left high school that's exactly what happened. I graduated on a particular Thursday. Two weeks later I was in basic training. The thing about military service that you learn right away when you are in service and in basic training and in your initial training and all that kind of stuff, you learn about that word service, and what it means to do that level of service that is weighted so heavily for little money for so many people. I'm from the post-Vietnam era days and what that means is when I joined the army we were not at war with anybody. But my drill sergeants were Vietnam vets. And you learn in a face to face fashion what it meant to give your all for a cause greater than yourself. Certainly we served for each other and we will always do that, we will always serve to maintain and protect the buddies you have to your left and to your right. But for many of us that service goes beyond that. One of the mottoes that I had to learn right away as a member of my basic training company was what they call the fifth article of the code of conduct. And that article refers to how we will never forget that we are American fighting men responsible for our actions and dedicated to the principles that makes our nation free. We will trust in our God and in the United States army. And while I learned that 29 years ago, it's still in my head. Because the day to day sacrifice of time, energy, and in many recent years life and limb, go to preserve the nation that we all love. And that's very very strong and powerful and a reason why many of us join. And we love that about us. When it comes to military counseling, and I like to tell veterans I work with this all the time, you know basic training, the department of the army took care of that. When you get out of service, the department of the army is not doing that part, you have the veterans' administration and various other entities that help you. And now that professional counselors and others are helping professionals like yourself have a chance to work with this population, a well-deserving population. There's a few things you would wanna know about the military and counseling members of the military. Why do we say fall in? Because that's the overarching military phrase to let everybody know close your mouth, turn around, stand right here and we're about ready to move out. You wanna understand this short discussion about how to help em understand we leave no one behind. That's the driving force behind aiding you and other professionals in working with the military population. We leave no one behind. We don't leave em behind in basic training. We don't leave em behind on the battlefield. We don't leave em behind when they come home. So we do our very best to make sure this group of people have a chance to reintegrate into their lives and reintegrate into their society as adaptable as possible. That's difficult, especially with the war years almost coming to an end. One thing that any clinician in my opinion who works with my family, and you gotta understand I call them my family because we're all service members of one type or another, the first thing you wanna learn is the culture of the military. Now, don't let all the movies you've seen shape your understanding of the culture of the military. If you want to understand the culture of the military, one thing you wanna start with is learning what we call military speak or in my case army speak. That involves the phrase hor and what hor means. Hor means yes. Hor means I'm coming. Hor means okay I'm going to sleep. It has a lot of meanings. But that's part of army speak and military speak. You wanna understand good to go. These are phrases that play out in life for veterans all the time. You wanna understand the phrase no go. N G. No go is a phrase that we use in training. You see in training, we go through a lot of various steps to learn various tasks. And if you pass those tasks, they call you a go. You're a go at this station. If you don't, they will say you are a no go. And the one thing you don't want is to be called a no go. That'll be important in a few seconds. There's also language like acronyms. APFT. For the army that was army physical fitness training. Duce and a hat. In the old days we had a truck that weighed two and a half tons. Duce and a hat. And there's a million of those throughout the Coast Guard, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corp. So you wanna become familiar with the military speak and what it means, how it's used. Because what you'll find is that as veterans come to see you and you begin to work with them, whether they know you're military or not, they will use this language with you. And that's quite important to understand. You wanna make sure you have meaning to go with the phrases. Because the veteran is applying meaning to their civilian life with military phrases. And we'll explain that a little bit more in a second. The other thing you wanna know, and this is quite important, and it helps you help them. And that is understanding the concept of loss, L O S S. Many times in your training you understand what loss is. Loss for someone who was hurt in an accident. Loss for someone who's older in age. All that's true for the veteran as well. But typically it comes at a shorter time in their lives. For example, I'm a veteran and I'm discharged from the army and I'm getting older. By contrast I'm still quite young. But I go outside a nice spring day and I think I'm gonna take a little jog around the park. And in my body as I run, it goes back to an earlier time when I was but 18 years old. And I could run two miles in 13 minutes. At my age today, not gonna happen. I tried it. It wasn't worth my time. I stopped. For many veterans they have to deal with the concept of loss. They have to deal with the loss of what they used to be able to do. In normal times and in normal conditions. They have to deal with the loss of what they were able to do when it comes down to their physical ability, their mental ability, their ability to handle multiple tasks all at the same time. That that loss of their speed, their agility, their strength, their cunning, their technical ability, their mental capacity, all of that may be damaged, affected or gone by what they have been through and that is hard to bear. You might think it's being in a wheelchair. You might think it's having what they call traumatic brain injury or TBI. It is not going to be the actual quote on quote diagnosis. It will be what that diagnosis means they can no longer do. And for a veteran who in their training days prided themselves on being first, upfront, the first one there, the one who plants the flag, that is very difficult to swallow. That is difficult to fathom. It is difficult to live. That's why they feel like they're burdened, like they feel like they are not putting in their fair share, carrying their own weight. And that's something clinicians like you and I need to always keep in mind when we work with the military. Usually these are individuals, male and female alike, that are nothing but go getters. Then the inability to be a go getter can put them in a psychic state, that is to say a mental state that makes them quite depressed, quite sad, quite angry. And also in a state where they would not even know what to do about it because their normal ways of addressing that was through their capacities to be great. And those might be diminished. For the clinician like you who works with this population, you also would need to possess a counselor trait called patience. We always talk about patience when we're in training. And when we get follow on supervision. But working with veterans requires a high degree of patience. Because although they might allow themselves to talk to you, to come to you for assistance and work, some of your interventions, although credible, may not fit their mentality. So what does that mean? That means many vets will still try to operate like they always have operated, which means the ability to adapt to the work at hand in terms of getting better cognitively or getting better emotionally, is delayed. Their comfort zone is an action. Typically not in thought, to be reflective. They will get up and want to go. You will be pressing them to think about or do other activities on occasion that will aid their ability to see their situation for what it is right now. And depending on who you're working with, that will be a hard sell. So they would call, they would do things rather that we might call resistance to treatment. They're just trying to work within your system. So you as well as I even though I'm a veteran, have to be patient with them. Naturally, military veterans carry, especially those from the war years, who were deployed what we call in theater, that means actually in Iraq or Afghanistan or other places where combat happened. You have to deal with the fact that they have a thing called trauma. And that trauma, yes, is physical, it is mental, but it's also just an experience. So how comfortable you are with trauma and the stories when and if they tell you their stories of trauma, is quite important. For the veteran to be looked at as not being valuable or an integral part or as we like to say present for duty, is quite devastating. So in your work with these veterans when you try your very best to do best for these proud men and women of our nation, remember what you say and how you say it because any phrases or any issues that make them think they're being judged to be not ready for duty, for them that means ready for their life as it is right now can be a setback for them. But because we love these men and women, because we so value what they have sacrificed for us for little pay, little comfort, and a whole lot of grief, we'll do this work, study this work so we leave no one behind. And we leave no one of them behind either. Thank you for your time. Hor.

THERAPY Talks 

00:16:10
SHANNON DERMER Doctor Ellis, thank you. I wanna say a few things about my knowledge about military counseling cause it's actually very little to give you some context before I ask some of these questions. In my family there's only one person that I know who served in the military and that was my great uncle Erve, who was, I believe he volunteered for World War Two. And the night before he was supposed to ship out, they were celebrating a bit, he fell asleep in the back of a jeep, there was a car accident, he broke his leg and was never even deployed. So that's about the extent of family knowledge of the military. My personal knowledge of the military relates to a short time when I was in Kansas and I worked with some families on a military base, Fort Riley and also a little bit with Fort Lebinworth, both in Kansas. And so I remember one of the things that shocked me the most was the military truly is its own culture. 

00:17:10
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes it is. 

00:17:10
SHANNON DERMER Has its own restaurants. Its own stores. Its own, what are they called the store where? 

00:17:15
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Commissary. 

00:17:15
SHANNON DERMER Thank you. The commissary. Everything, it was its own world. You could survive just living on a military base in the United States. Now a lot of people did live off base. But you could stay there and never have to be in civilian life if you didn't want to. 

00:17:30
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS  You don't have to really consort with civilians if you don't want to. 

00:17:35
SHANNON DERMER Right. And that's what it felt like sometimes when we did talk to some of the military personnel who came off base, it felt like consorting in some ways because it was such a different life and a different view. And so that's about the extent of my knowledge. Do you think it's possible for people who do not come from a military family or who have served to really work with military personnel and their families? 

00:18:00
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I do. And it's like many things in this helping profession. You really just have to understand and work really hard to understand their quote on quote world view, which for many who don't live it in one way or another, a lot of what we do is quite weird. It doesn't make a lot of, what I like to say when I was in, civilian sense. But it makes a lot of military sense. 

00:18:30
SHANNON DERMER Yes. I was really glad that you talked about some of the key pieces of language cause I'm very much post-modern and believe language is important. But also some of the acronyms, I remember being completely overwhelmed by the acronyms. I stopped and asked directions one time and they gave me about six different acronyms and I had no idea what they were talking about. 

00:18:50
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes. We have a lot of them. And believe it or not it's like when you learn French or you learn German. In high school at one point they say immerse yourself and you'll pick it up quicker. Army has a way of immersing you quite quick. 

00:19:00
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:19:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS So you pick it up. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER One of the phrases you talked about was ready for duty. 

00:19:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Ready for duty. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER Ready for duty. So how do you help military personnel when they come back be ready for family duty? 

00:19:15
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And that's really, you're saying it correctly, that's really, I'm trying to bridge what they would say to bridge what we talk about and make sense at one time so hopefully I did that in one way or another. Ready for duty for their civilian life is a transitional dimension of what we have to do, especially those from the war years who when I've been deployed in the desert and stuff like that, you know, you live differently. And how you speak, the time you have to understand, the time you have to think about things, the time you have to ponder various ways and sit and talk about things, is about that big, it's a minute. Cause life is on the line when you're deployed. Well you don't want your wife to make a decision in a minute. You don't want kids to make decisions in a minute. You don't wanna speak to your wife and family the way you speak to fellow soldiers in a combat zone. It's not gonna work out too well. And they have to learn that because it's blinding sometimes to be in one situation for so long and then all of a sudden, even if it's a week to think okay now I'm in my living room. People who haven't had to make that mental switch would not know how difficult sometimes that is to make. And because you're taught to have body memory and reaction as a soldier or a veteran, things happen in the house, you just turn to react to it, you don't process it and get perspective. You only have a few perspectives when you're deployed. They have to learn that. And for some, not as easy as it could be. 

00:21:05
SHANNON DERMER You had to basically untrain what you've been training in order to save your own life and the lives of your military family. 

00:21:10
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes. That family requires you to be quick, not waffling and a decider very very quickly. Your wife really doesn't want that. 

00:21:20
SHANNON DERMER There must be a little discussion first. 

00:21:20
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Or husband depending on your situation. But yes that's not the way families would work. 

00:21:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. That actually reminds me, have you ever seen, cause I know you talk a lot about TV and movies when you're trying to help people understand things, have you ever seen the movie “The Great Santini”? 

00:21:35
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS No, I have not. 

00:21:35
SHANNON DERMER Oh. I would love to discuss that with you some other time. But that movie is a lot about I believe he is a marine but it's about him coming home from active service and being on a military base and his family is there also. But how oftentimes he doesn't make that transition. He treats his family as if they are military personnel. I believe he calls them hogs and he tells his kids to fall in and things like that and how he expects them to adapt to his military way of communicating and coping instead of him making that transition. 

00:22:15
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I've seen many try that when I was on active duty and it's not always as adaptive as they would like it to be. There's reasons for it. But it's not always the best way to proceed. 

00:22:30
SHANNON DERMER I'm gonna put you on the spot for a second and ask you, since you are very good about identifying popular media that can help people to understand situations, is there a TV show or a movie or a book that you can think of that you're like well if you're non-military, look at this and it'll help you just get an inkling of what people... 

00:22:50
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Well there's two dimensions. Actually I would not go to movies because the military's been so well documented over the years. If you, to understand the culture of, first, there are internet videos, documentaries done by the History Channel and the Discovery Channel, about what it takes to become a marine, what it takes to become a soldier, an airman, a sailor. And I think those are important for those who don't understand, just to understand the transition that they go through, how some of us fall in love with it and wanna live that life every day. When I was young I was that way. But I wasn't married, thank goodness. That wouldn't have worked out for me. But in terms of people understanding, look at what these kids, typically they're kids, they're older of course but what these kids are going through. The language, the change, the clothes, the food. And that's great. I think if I were to go to a movie to really underscore life in a military, I haven't found one yet that is not Hollywood. And again I'm from the inside. If I was not a service member, who knows what I might pick. But documentaries is the way to go because so many people try to figure out us. There's a lot of em. And you can have your ray to find out from the wives' perspective. I was so many things in the army. I used to work with the families from within so that there'd be a good adjustment when the new families came and the first sergeant's wife and then the commander's wife always had a little thing, every wife of every officer in charge, they all had little wife committees where all the wives knew each other and all the husbands knew each other. So it was so much that those documentaries exist. Those would really help people to understand just what it means. I will give you one example, though, that's not on any movie. You know when I was a private in the army on active duty, I only had one stripe, and my shopping budget my wife and I had, it was just she and I, was 25 dollars every two weeks. 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER Wow. 

00:25:00
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And this was 1989. 

00:25:00
SHANNON DERMER Wow. Yeah, that was when a lot of people were in poverty, privates and things like that. 

00:25:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Lower ranks don't get a lot of money. 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:10
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And our shopping budget was 25 dollars every two weeks. And by the end of that second week in the apartment complex I was living in cause I didn't live on the post yet, sometimes wives would come and knock on the door, “Can I borrow a slice of cheese?” “Can I borrow your ketchup? Cause my husband's coming home for lunch and he likes cheese or ketchup on his sandwich.” And it was a community that people who understood we don't have a great deal, but our husbands or wives are pulling 12, 14 hour days. And they just want a slice of cheese on their sandwich and I gotta go borrow that until pay ay comes. So things like that really give a different picture of what life is like. We got the good and we got the not so good. And that's part of the not so good. 

00:26:00
SHANNON DERMER I actually remember being very surprised by that that they're actually, the... 

00:26:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Lower enlisted. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER The lower enlisted, I was gonna ask how to say that properly, the lower enlisted, I was surprised, cause they are putting their lives on the line, they are sacrificing for their families, how little some of them were paid and that there were actually people with families who were on government assistance, food stamps and things like that, who were in the military. I remember being shocked at that and that is not something I would have known about a lot of military families if I hadn't worked on that base. 

00:26:30
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And many won't say it beyond your connection to them because that's part of that dimension of how veterans don't like to ask for help because on the one hand if you're a private with one stripe but you drive a tank, that M1 tank is 15 million dollars. And you have enormous responsibility for this 15 million dollar tank. And they expect you to be all things at all times as you drive this tank and keep the lives of three other people in your hands. And when you go home, if you have two children, the money you make can't feed them. But don't go asking for any help cause that means you're weak. All at the same time. I got all this power when I'm at the job but I'm helpless at home and that is devastating. So we don't, they don't tend to ask for help. 

00:27:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. Well I can imagine, we only have a couple minutes left, but that that feeling of being powerful and powerless at the same time is a lot of things. When you're away and you can't help your family when there's something traumatic, you know, at home. When you love your country and you're serving it yet you're not being paid as much as you should be to help take care of your family. When... 

00:27:45
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And they take benefits away. Over the recent 15 years, with all the rah rah talk we appreciate that, for us at the same time they've been taking benefits away. So it's difficult and war years exacerbate all of that. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER  Right. And that's a really fine line I think especially for a non-military counselor or a therapist to walk which is how do I acknowledge the pride while also acknowledging some of the faults with the military system without offending somebody. 

00:28:20
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And non-military counselors do like and I mentioned that a moment ago, they do like to apply with good intention in my book most cases, interventions that are against the service member's logic at that time. And that becomes something that's quite in-congruent. And it also can prematurely end the relationship for the service member because they see the world differently at that time. And non-military people have to figure that out. 

00:28:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. And I wish we actually had more time to talk about that but unfortunately we don't. But if you'd like to see more therapy talks by Doctor Ellis or some of our other experts, please visit the Alexander Street Press website. I wanna thank all of you for joining us and I especially wanna thank you, Doctor Ellis for talking today and for your service for all of us.
