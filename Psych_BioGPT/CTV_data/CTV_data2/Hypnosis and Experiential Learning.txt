MICHAEL YAPKO Welcome everyone to this clinical demonstration hour. I am Michael Yapko. Thanks so much for coming. And what I want to do is spend just a couple of minutes creating a framework, a context for what I hope to be able to demonstrate. Everyone at this congress has a positive bias in the direction of hypnosis. People are comfortable with it, people recognize the clinical merits of it and that is of course, I think highly justified. We certainly have plenty of evidence to show that when people are focused, they learn more easily. How much of therapy involves teaching, how much of therapy involves education. But also the value of focusing strategies as a way of helping people shift their tension towards things that will ultimately be helpful to them. As I mentioned previously in my keynote, one of the ways of thinking about the nature of therapy in general and certainly hypnosis in particular is how can I shift the person's attention from where they've been focusing that isn't particularly helpful to them to another focal point that can be helpful to them. So often what people's problems are about can be defined as or described as problems of focus. They are focusing on their feelings when they should be thinking or they are focusing on thinking when they should be paying attention to their feelings or they are focused on themselves when they should be paying attention to their partner, to their kids or they are focusing on their partner and their kids when they should be focusing on themselves. And if you get the essence of what I've just described, focus is a good thing potentially. But obviously, a lot of what influences your quality of experience is what you focus on. What the direction is of your focus and what the quality is of your focus and it's why once you study hypnosis and really master the principles of hypnosis, it becomes so much easier to understand how people generate the kinds of problems that they are experiencing. It isn't to me personally about pathology, to me it isn't about diagnostic labels. To me it's far more about what are the elements of experience that are worth engaging with? What are the elements of experience that you haven't been paying attention to that can make a difference for what the new ideas are that I can introduce that will make a difference. And so to reiterate a point I've made previously, hypnosis cures nothing. Hypnosis cures nothing. What has the potential to be curative or therapeutic is what happens during the hypnosis session. What the person has the chance to focus on and engage with that isn't normally a part of what they attend to. And so what I hope to be able to demonstrate with whomever is gonna end up being my demonstration partner here, I don't have anyone yet. I'll call for a volunteer in just a moment. What I hope to be able to demonstrate is how we can use hypnosis as a context of discovery, providing environment. Now, Erickson used to say that in essence there are therapists who is like the weather, a therapist provides a climate for change, an atmosphere that makes change possible. And I certainly hope that I'll be able to do that with someone and for someone in the context of this demonstration. Now as is typical for me, I did not pre-arrange someone, I really like to just get a volunteer but let me give you some self-selection criteria. First, first, being of course is, there needs to be something you feel comfortable, talking about in front of a group. I don't need to get into all the gory details and wouldn't want to but at least whatever you're gonna raise as something you're comfortable talking about. Secondly, you have to, not have been a demonstration subject for anybody else or me previously. The whole idea for the foundation is to be able to continually give broader range of experience to more people. So uh… you, you I would like to you disqualify yourself if you've been a demonstration subject with me or anybody else previously. And then of course, you know the big thing is that there is something you want help with and that is what I intend to get into. So is there anyone who feels like doing a hypnosis session? Yeah. I'll take this lady in the third row. Your hand seem to lift right up almost involuntarily. I'm not sure just what that means. How is it going? 

00:06:05
RHONDA Good. 

00:06:10
MICHAEL YAPKO All right. Good to go? 

00:06:10
RHONDA Yes. 

00:06:10
MICHAEL YAPKO All right. Everybody settled in. What would you like help with? 

00:06:25
RHONDA Umm… specifically with focus on boundaries. I'm in the middle of a divorce and I'm was a caretaker in my marriage and I'm really wanting to step away from that role and step away from investing my energy in my ex-husband and his family and begin to care about myself. 

00:06:50
MICHAEL YAPKO You are in the middle of a divorce. 

00:06:50
RHONDA Separation. Yes. 

00:06:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:06:55
RHONDA A legal separation. 

00:06:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And is it definitely over or is this your chance that it might… 

00:07:00
RHONDA No, it's definitely over. 

00:07:00
MICHAEL YAPKO It is definitely over. So tell me a little bit about the caretaker role. 

00:07:10
RHONDA Umm… my role, umm… I think spent a lot of time sort of managing my own anxiety about my husband's anxiety. Umm… he umm… had bipolar or has bipolar and I spend a lot of time trying to manage him and uh… I dealt with a lot of chaos and drama and umm… just wanting to step away from all of that and still finding myself engaged in that, a little bit of sort of being pulled in and texts and emails and things like that. I'm having a hard time trying to be kind, at the same time, really kind to myself. I'm looking after myself. 

00:08:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. How did you determine that he needed you in that caretaker role? 

00:08:05
RHONDA That's a good question? 

00:08:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Thanks. 

00:08:15
RHONDA Umm… well our first major interaction, he was having a panic attack and he found me and I think at the time, I felt honored that he would choose me, we were together in another situation with a group of other people and would be partnered at all. And so that's sort of set the stage perhaps. 

00:08:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You interpreted as an honor. 

00:08:40
RHONDA Interesting that I would go there but I, I did I felt like he was really needing something and that I could provide that. 

00:08:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And over the course of the years of your marriage… 

00:08:55
RHONDA Yes. 

00:09:00
MICHAEL YAPKO How did you determine that he still needed that kind of care taking? 

00:09:05
RHONDA Umm… well… I don't, I'm not sure, I do know that I realized what I was doing and really made a conscious attempt to step out of that overfunctioning role. And allow myself to be more vulnerable and really see his competency. Umm… but I'm not sure when I, how I maintained that, what was the question exactly? 

00:09:35
MICHAEL YAPKO How you determined throughout the marriage that he continued to need you in that caretaker role? 

00:09:45
RHONDA I guess, his behavior, he would just… 

00:09:45
MICHAEL YAPKO The need was there. 

00:09:50
RHONDA It seemed to be such and I think, that was a long history for me of care taking. 

00:09:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Even before the marriage? 

00:09:55
RHONDA Yeah. I was (inaudible ). 

00:10:00
MICHAEL YAPKO So when you meet someone now, how do you determine whether this is pathological need to be taken care of or whether it's an honor that they are asking you for help? 

00:10:15
RHONDA Such a good question. Umm… I don't, I don't think it's an, I don't, I sort of I'm allergic to that role now. You know, it's interesting I have boundaries in other areas of my life but with him, I haven't. So getting back to your question. Umm… I don't think it's an honor to take care of someone. I'm a counselor and I'm paid to do that and that's when I do that in my working role. So there is no need to determine because I don't take that role on other than with him and his family. 

00:10:55
MICHAEL YAPKO How many more people are you gonna meet in the course of your lifetime outside the counseling office that are going to be needy? 

00:11:00
RHONDA Wait, I'm actually, that wasn't true because there is also my mother. 

00:11:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Oh really. 

00:11:10
RHONDA Shocking. 

00:11:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Shocking. 

00:11:10
RHONDA Yeah, so how many more people I'm gonna meet but we probably plenty of needy people, yes. 

00:11:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And how do you then determine when you meet them whether to meet their need or run? 

00:11:25
RHONDA I usually run. 

00:11:30
MICHAEL YAPKO It's not the question, I asked. 

00:11:30
RHONDA So how do you determine whether to meet the need or to run? I need to learn that skill. 

00:11:45
MICHAEL YAPKO You need to learn that skill, did you said? 

00:11:45
RHONDA How do I determine whether, well, it's not my job to meet other people's needs. 

00:11:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Can I pause for a moment? 

00:11:55
RHONDA Please. 

00:11:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, let me make a comment to the rest of you. Part of what I'm doing whenever I'm interviewing somebody is finding out where is the gap, the gap in their knowledge, the thing that they don't really know that's working against them and what you're hearing Rhonda (ph.) say in response to these questions is, she doesn't have a strategy for how to determine when to step in and help and when to back away and protect self. This is exactly what I'm talking about. Now in saying that, think in terms of if you were going to do a session with her now, what are the kind of things that you would want to talk about? What's the skill that she's gonna need to have and now turning back to you as you hear me say that to them, how would you articulate that, what would you say the skill is that you really need to have. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:00
MICHAEL YAPKO What skills, plural. 

00:13:05
RHONDA Umm… I need to mend to my own experience and to see myself as a separate individual. 

00:13:10
MICHAEL YAPKO That would be helpful. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
RHONDA Umm… umm… yeah and… 

00:13:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Let me prompt you, let me prompt you with another question. 

00:13:20
RHONDA Okay. 

00:13:25
MICHAEL YAPKO How do you determine whether someone's need is reasonable, legitimate, valid versus someone making an unreasonable demand? 

00:13:35
RHONDA Good question, yes. Yeah and I think one way is to step back and another way is to tune in. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL YAPKO And do what when… 

00:13:45
RHONDA See what it feels like. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. If you tune into what it feels like, now we are back in your feelings. 

00:13:50
RHONDA Right. 

00:13:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Which is okay, that's one source of information. 

00:13:55
RHONDA Yes. 

00:13:55
MICHAEL YAPKO But in terms of, if you're gonna step back. 

00:14:00
RHONDA Yeah. 

00:14:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Step back and do what? 

00:14:00
RHONDA Assess it. Look at the person, look at… 

00:14:05
MICHAEL YAPKO How specifically? 

00:14:05
RHONDA Well, umm… well, you know, if they have a mental illness, it might not be a good match for me given my history. Umm… just stepping back and taking in information about them and umm… whether or not it's a good fit for me, whether or not it's can be a give and take situation as opposed to more of a take situation. 

00:14:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Let's talk a little bit about the hypnotic side of the equation. 

00:14:35
RHONDA All right. 

00:14:35
MICHAEL YAPKO You have experience with hypnosis? 

00:14:40
RHONDA Yes. 

00:14:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Uh… it's easy for you? 

00:14:40
RHONDA To go into trance? 

00:14:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Uh… huh. 

00:14:45
RHONDA I think so, I meditate regularly. Umm… at the 100 hour training something that was relatively easy to do. 

00:14:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Are you ready? 

00:14:55
RHONDA I am. 

00:14:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Let's go do it. 

00:14:55
RHONDA Okay. 

00:15:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Arrange yourself in whatever way is comfortable for you and whatever you do to get yourself comfortable, do it. So focus yourself, taking a few deep breaths, that's right. And as you start to absorb yourself, gradually of course, it's an interesting question whether I should say something to be helpful to you or that I should let you flounder for a while. Whether I should evaluate the merits of your needs or whether I should step in and help. Of course, in this context, helping is what it's all about. But little by little, even as you help yourself into a more comfortable frame of mind, a more comfortable experience of yourself. You have an opportunity here 

00:16:30
[sil.] 

00:16:35
MICHAEL YAPKO To make some very important decisions. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:45
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm certainly curious across my professional lifetime how people make decisions. How people decide at just what moment they can really be comfortable. How people decide at just what moment they can be so attentive. And the fact that your attention wanders initially isn't at all unexpected. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:45
MICHAEL YAPKO But with your experiences with meditation and your experiences with hypnosis, you've learnt that are different qualities of experience. 

00:18:00
[sil.] 

00:18:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And how the very experience that can be so helpful in one place isn't particularly helpful some place else. 

00:18:20
[sil.] 

00:18:25
MICHAEL YAPKO And for me, it's part of developing a deeper, a much deeper understanding. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
MICHAEL YAPKO That each aspect of your experience is valuable. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Wanting to be a caretaker is valuable, Rhonda. the fact that you're that generous spirit. 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:10
MICHAEL YAPKO The fact that you can think of wanting to be helpful is important to you. And even making it a career decision, 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO There is something really special about that. When you look at how many people in the world can't do that. People who are so self-absorbed, people who are rather make a lot of money at someone's expense than help someone. I've heard for years, I'm sure you have too, people saying, how people become therapists work out their own issues, I don't buy it for a second. There is something nice about that quality of dedication. But one of the things that's valuable to consider much more carefully 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Is a much broader question Rhonda. When it's being helpful not very helpful. 

00:21:05
[sil.] 

00:21:10
MICHAEL YAPKO I have an acquaintance who has a 38 year old son, who's a bright kid, a nice kid but he's 38 going on 15 and still wants mommy to do his laundry for him. It's such a curious thing, how comfortable she is doing that for him. I don't know what you would say about that. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And I remember one time, I had a new client, she asked whether I would mind, if she brought her baby with her. I said that's fine with me. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
MICHAEL YAPKO She pushes the baby carriage into my waiting room. And I come out to greet her and fully expecting to look into the carriage and see a baby. You might imagine my surprise when I look in the carriage and see this. Four and a half year old toddler and she could see the surprise on my face mainly because I didn't protect her from it. And she was so quick to explain that when he was learning to walk, he fell down, gashed his leg and she was so traumatized by that. She's pretty much been real in morale ever since. And I think about all the running and playing this child isn't doing. All the balance he isn't learning. All the muscle strengths he isn't developing and I wonder what you would have said to her? but I am willing to predict, he wouldn't have complemented her on her strategy. Now I can think of lots of examples and what it brings you to is a new level of awareness. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:50
MICHAEL YAPKO That you can love someone, care about someone and you still have to let him scrape his knee. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:15
MICHAEL YAPKO And as you get more deeply absorbed in the realization. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
MICHAEL YAPKO That it's nice to be a caretaker. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
MICHAEL YAPKO But not all the time and not for everyone. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And it's such a curious thing to me. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:00
MICHAEL YAPKO How many times over 30 some years of practice, someone tells me about their inability to assert themselves or to establish and maintain boundaries. Interesting terminology. 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:35
MICHAEL YAPKO But when I lead them through the sequence, 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
MICHAEL YAPKO To know how to define yourself, to know what's important in your own values. To have the language to say this is how I feel. 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Do you know when someone's crossing the line and making a demand. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
MICHAEL YAPKO So often people will say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all those things and they come to realize the hard part 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Is looking into someone's eyes and saying I don't want to and dealing with the inevitable, disappointment or even anger. Oh, that's an interesting thing. Because if you ask most people whether they like conflict, they will say no. Almost they happen to be the host of a radio talk show. The fact that you don't like conflict. 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:55
MICHAEL YAPKO People don't especially caring people don't. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
MICHAEL YAPKO But it brings you to a very important decision point Rhonda. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And decide to avoid the conflict, say yes and wonder how you got drawn in again 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Or you can say some variation of no. And it isn't about yes every where or no every where. There are firm boundaries that are unyielding, there are permeable boundaries, flexible boundaries. The freedom to say yes sometimes, 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:45
MICHAEL YAPKO But what shifts for you now, what can shift. It's no longer just about how you feel. 

00:31:00
[sil.] 

00:31:05
MICHAEL YAPKO It's also about the impact on the other person. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Now, I don't know if you were here when I gave my keynote address but one of the things that I expressed in appreciation for was Milton Erickson's ability to comfort the afflicted 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:45
MICHAEL YAPKO But also express an appreciation for his ability to afflict the comfortable. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Comfort can be a good thing but you know and I know that the real growth happens when you go beyond when you step outside your comfort zone and in starting to redefine yourself. 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Who you were quite different from who you're becoming. 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:32:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Relationships are changing, you know that. Relationships are being redefined, you know that. And the opportunity to redefine yourself has never been more obvious. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:40
MICHAEL YAPKO As you contemplate 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Four and a half year old toddler in a carriage 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:34:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And all the people who are much older than they should be when they are old enough to do their own damn laundry. There might well be something that has come into a very sharp focus for you right now. And if you know what I'm talking about, what's become crystal clear, you can signal me by raising the index finger of your right hand. And so in just a moment, I'd like to ask you to describe out loud what you're aware even as you continue to be comfortable and focused and it can be easy for you, surprisingly easy. If you would now describe for me what you're aware of experiencing. 

00:35:40
RHONDA I know, I have known, I'm certainly not honoring me and I'm definitely not honoring him. I know all of that. So it's not an epiphany, it's how or that something, it's in the way. I don't, I don't know what. 

00:36:15
MICHAEL YAPKO But how 

00:36:15
RHONDA And I was doing it and then I pulled back in, that's the peace. I know how. 

00:36:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Tell me about the how. 

00:36:25
RHONDA The how is to disengage, to step back, to live my life and let him live his. 

00:36:40
MICHAEL YAPKO He's gonna make demands. 

00:36:40
RHONDA Indeed. 

00:36:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Your response? 

00:36:45
RHONDA None. 

00:36:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Do your own damn laundry. 

00:36:55
RHONDA Talk to my lawyer. 

00:37:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Certainly the most popular response. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Soon to be ex-husband, when you say talk to my lawyer. That's not a bad thing to say, is it? 

00:37:20
RHONDA No. 

00:37:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And neither is do your own laundry, is it? 

00:37:25
RHONDA No. 

00:37:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And neither is take your own steps? 

00:37:30
RHONDA No. 

00:37:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Learn to walk, metaphorically speaking. Can you say that? 

00:37:50
RHONDA Yeah. 

00:37:50
MICHAEL YAPKO You can. Can you do that? 

00:38:00
RHONDA Yes. 

00:38:05
MICHAEL YAPKO It's a funny thing that sense of detachment. 

00:38:10
[sil.] 

00:38:15
MICHAEL YAPKO I had one couple that I worked with. They were fighting all the time and came to the realization that it just wasn't a good place for either of them. And what was really curious was when they came in for a session and she was so clear, so clear, 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:38:55
MICHAEL YAPKO I can't be with this guy. And all of a sudden, her whole demeanor changed. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:10
MICHAEL YAPKO She was cool polite, aloof, and when the session ended, her husband left separately and I asked her about it. I said, you didn't react to any of the usual things he tries to hook you into. She said, I know. And I asked how did you do that? 

00:39:50
[sil.] 

00:39:55
MICHAEL YAPKO She said, I looked at him as a museum piece. And I didn't immediately understand what she meant by that. She said, you know, how you walk through a museum and you see these display pieces behind paned glass. I was just looking at him through the glass, a museum piece, a piece of old history. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Very interesting to me. That when you step back, 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:55
MICHAEL YAPKO I think you know the rest. 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And sort of just checking one more time, 

00:41:10
[sil.] 

00:41:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Can you describe what you're aware of right now? 

00:41:20
RHONDA I was there in my place of detachment and coolness and then I got distracted. 

00:41:35
MICHAEL YAPKO And now? 

00:41:35
RHONDA And now I'm clear. 

00:41:40
MICHAEL YAPKO So when you're taken a stroll through the museum of that former life, 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:55
MICHAEL YAPKO That would be interesting to observe the things that used to provoke a reaction that just don't anymore. It just don't. And if the phrase, that's history, surfaces in your awareness of those times, well, it really wouldn't surprise me. 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And in just letting that settle in a comfortable way, a surprisingly comfortable way. 

00:43:10
[sil.] 

00:43:15
MICHAEL YAPKO That's right. Deep breath. 

00:43:20
[sil.] 

00:43:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Easy and all through the years to come, all the new clients that you meet that want to be your new best friend, all the people that you meet that want something from you. Your time, your expertise, your money, your support. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:05
MICHAEL YAPKO The fact that people want things from you. So what else is new? But how you decide what you are willing to give at a given moment in time. 

00:44:30
[sil.] 

00:44:35
MICHAEL YAPKO There is something more to take into account now than just tradition or just your feelings. 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
MICHAEL YAPKO There is, isn't there. And that is what can stay with you. So effortlessly and even in the times when you get to strap that, how quickly that phrase, that history can represent, 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:45
MICHAEL YAPKO You know, exactly what it represents. And when you know that's true, feel that's true, feel comfortable, walking through the museum, of old stuff, that you just look at once in a while through a thick pane of glass. 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:35
MICHAEL YAPKO What a difference. 

00:46:40
[sil.] 

00:46:45
MICHAEL YAPKO And with that, you can bring yourself to a comfortable point of really integrating, absorbing the deeper implications in order to reach whatever closure is comfortable for you. Take your time and when you feel like you're ready to, you can start to process of reorienting yourself gradually. Comfortably, letting your eyes open whenever you're ready. Take your time. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:50
RHONDA Thank you. 

00:47:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Hi. 

00:47:55
RHONDA Hi. 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Care to tell me about it? 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:15
RHONDA Learn to walk. Yeah. That really resonated with me. It's not mine. I can have mine and he can have his. And the person, I used to be as opposed to the person, I am. There is a lot of good things about who I used to be and there is lots of good things about the person I am and it can come together. 

00:48:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Exactly right. 

00:48:45
RHONDA Yeah. 

00:48:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Exactly right. To me, it was an important thing to be able to say and your caretaker is nice. Just not every where. 

00:49:00
RHONDA Yes. 

00:49:00
MICHAEL YAPKO What would that be like? 

00:49:00
RHONDA Certainly not your partner. 

00:49:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And certainly somebody who knows… 

00:49:05
RHONDA It still will work. 

00:49:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, yeah and for somebody who is going to in essence exploit that. 

00:49:10
RHONDA Yeah. 

00:49:15
MICHAEL YAPKO That's not the person to do it. 

00:49:15
RHONDA Yes. 

00:49:15
MICHAEL YAPKO I think you got that. 

00:49:15
RHONDA I did. 

00:49:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

00:49:20
RHONDA Yeah, thank you. 

00:49:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. Anything else that you want to comment on? 

00:49:30
RHONDA Umm… you don't need to be in a really deep trance to absorb which I know intellectually that experience I was, took me a while to really go deeper. I imagine you knew that and it, it's not necessary to be really deep. 

00:49:50
MICHAEL YAPKO It's need to be deep enough to make the connections. You know, it's not as if deeper is better. 

00:49:55
RHONDA Exactly. 

00:50:00
MICHAEL YAPKO It's just quality of the connections that get made. Yeah. 

00:50:05
RHONDA Yeah. It was excellent, thank you, Michael. 

00:50:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you Rhonda. Are you willing to take questions from the group? You'd be all right? 

00:50:10
RHONDA Yeah. 

00:50:10
MICHAEL YAPKO You don't have to. 

00:50:15
RHONDA No. I would maybe it'd be good for me. 

00:50:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. We have just a few minutes left, are there any questions from the group? Anybody want to ask about her experience or ask about what I was doing? Any… I'll repeat the question for the recording back there. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN I love many of the stories you've told. 

00:50:45
[sil.] 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Could you tell, it's almost resonated with you a bit. 

00:50:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, the question was first for Rhonda about how did she feel about the metaphor, about the museum piece when I was talking about that couple that had been arguing a lot and so get her response to that and then the second question was can I tell one metaphor that I'm using as resonating with someone? Okay, you want to… 

00:51:20
RHONDA Umm…, it, it did kind of resonate because, it's really about a relic from the past and seeing myself as a different person in the past. So it did come and resonate and the thick glass, visual was really interesting too because it gave me that boundary, that really is the theme of this. So it was, it did resonate, it was helpful. 

00:51:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. The question about resonating. How much is resonance necessary in order for someone to learn something. Can you learn something from something that you don't resonate with and you know part of creating the context of hypnosis is I have no way of knowing how much resonance there really is and you can get a general sense but you know, if I want to know what's going on in the mind of the person I'm working with, you know, I'm reasonably competent but I'm not a mind reader. I'm, I'm gonna have to ask and to be able to check in and have the interaction is, is really important. Are we at least connecting on the idea. But different levels, you know, sometimes when you're doing a hypnosis session, you're trying to build new cognitive associations and that's not gonna be a deep hypnotic experience. Sometimes you're gonna be working on making emotional connections with things. Sometimes you're gonna be working on relational things, interpersonal things and so each time you do hypnosis, there are different elements that you're focusing on and amplifying and as long as the person can engage and learn something from the story of it, even if it doesn't have that human aha moment to it, it can still be therapeutically valuable. Okay, are there any other questions? Okay, back there. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Just start with how your induction was more comparative… 

00:53:20
[sil.] 

00:53:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Let, let me repeat the question first. The, the more of an observation that the induction was really more of a narrative and certainly wasn't a technique oriented induction and so he's asking how that worked for Rhonda? 

00:53:40
RHONDA Umm… I'm accustomed to bringing myself to a state of quiet and calm. Umm… so I think just the meditation background, it was something I did myself as opposed to being guided to. Umm… and I'm not sure if that influenced the way you did it because you knew that I have that history. 

00:54:00
MICHAEL YAPKO You know, J. Hailey (ph.) used to say that he would march people through this formal hypnotic induction process in early sessions and then when he'd come in for the next session, the person who immediately go into hypnosis and then he'd bring the person out of hypnosis to do the induction. And so to, to give you a response to that, the induction is in essence a conscious mind baby-sitter and all I was really saying to Rhonda is you already know how to do this. Do what you know how to do and for me, get out of the way. On the other hand, when I asked the question, so you're experienced comfortable with hypnosis, if she had said no, I, you know, this will be the first time I'm doing this, I would have certainly been much more structured, much more deliberate about it but the larger point is when you're working with people who are experienced, your induction really doesn't need to be a whole lot beyond, you can go into hypnosis now. Okay, all right, yes sir. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN I was (inaudible ) in, in the book, so (inaudible ) but it's also a history of (inaudible ) at the same time and I (inaudible ). 

00:55:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, the, the question was okay, so establish you know boundary now with her soon to be ex-husband. There is the focus on the boundary but there is also a need to be an acknowledgement of love. Okay. So when I'm talking to her about the value of being a caretaker, what's right about it? What's kind about it? What's compassionate about it? I'm honoring that side that you weren't in this relationship for a pathological reason. You're in this relationship because you cared and what I don't want her to do is criticize herself, think of herself as weak, why am I a caretaker, it's too global. And to really describe the essence of what I was doing in terms of therapeutic strategy was all I really wanted to do, to crystallize it for you, all I really wanted to do was introduce a notion of selectivity. To be selective. It's not to be in a caretaker's bad or good. Over here, fine, over here not so much. And that as you develop selectivity, that it's not just your feelings of pitying this person or, or you know feeling guilty, if you don't help this person, it's taking it to another level of what is the impact on this person if I help? As much as my feeling is I want to help, what if my feelings of wanting to help is going to end up hurting the person and so the metaphors that revolved around the theme of you can hurt someone by helping them. And it requires you then to think beyond your feelings, to think in terms of what is my impact gonna be if I do this. Yeah. Where are we? Time for one more question. Back there. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN Did you come up with the story about a toddler, carriage, uh, just spontaneously (inaudible )? 

00:57:41
MICHAEL YAPKO I, I could have told, the question was did I come up with the story or the metaphor about the baby carriage spontaneously? You know, once you are clear about what the message is that you want to give someone. Once you're clear about what the theme is that you're wanting to address, then for me, it's just whatever story comes up that illustrates that, so, I, I could have given her ten million different stories like I could have talked about a mom in a grocery store with a kid screaming for cookies or I could have talked to her about a boss coming to an employee and saying at the last minute, I need you to work over time, cancel your holiday. I could have come up with a million different stories. So yeah at that point, it's pretty spontaneous but what isn't spontaneous is I'm very deliberate about here is the message, I want to give my person, my client, all right. Rhonda, thank you so much for being willing to do this. 

00:58:35
RHONDA Thank you. 

00:58:35
MICHAEL YAPKO I appreciate. Well, wouldn't you agree? 

00:58:35
RHONDA Thank you. 

00:58:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. Thank you all for coming. I appreciate it.
