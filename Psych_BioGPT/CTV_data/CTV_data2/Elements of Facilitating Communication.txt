Dr. Henya Kagan (Klein) 

00:00:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  How can IPR help you become more effective in your life. Interpersonal Process Recall or IPR is designed to help you become a better listener in the more effective communicator. You will gain a better understanding of another person's lifestyle, behaviors and attitudes. And the people you deal with in your personal professional life will recognize that you understand them, and that you are interested in them. There's frequently results and people becoming less stressed and better able to work with you to accomplish mutual goals. 

00:01:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) We help you learn these Interpersonal Effectiveness through a series of planned experiences. Some of the units are devoted to teaching specific skills, some units encourage you to look at the kinds of Interpersonal stresses which are difficult for you personally to deal with. Certain units encourage theoretical discussion, while others provide you with this new ways to study yourself and action at your own pace using video or audiotape. After completing IPR training, people typically are better able to help themselves and others achieve, improve interpersonal relationships. The unit which instructors most often choose to begin the program is entitled the Elements of Communication. 

00:02:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) In this unit, we deal with specific skills or ways of responding to someone which we found effective facilitators and Interviewers often used. Skills which ineffective communicators practically never used. The extent to which effective interviewers used this specific behaviors, seemed to depend upon the person they were with and their goals. But apparently the skills or so called "response modes" where within their repertoire. In their tool box, so to speak. The ineffective interviewers almost without exception avoided these elements of communication for reasons we will discuss later. In this unit, we will help you learn these skills. So that you can add them to the interpersonal skills you already have. Although, these elements are not the way of responding to every single statement you hear, after you've learned them, I think you'll be amazed at how often you find them useful. The first element or response mode will study, is called "The Exploratory Response." Exploratory responses encourage a person to stay deeply involved in the communication. Yet at the same time, offer a great deal of freedom and latitude in what his or her next response will be. In other words, you respond in such a way that the person you are talking with is encourage to become an active participant in the communication. Rather than a passive receiver of your advice and knowledge. Your responses encourage the other person to explore further, to go more deeply, to expand or elaborate and to assume a great deal of responsibility for the direction and content of their next statements. Non-exploratory responses however, maybe well meaning but give the other person little opportunity to explore, expand or express themselves freely. In general, non-exploratory responses tend to make other people more passive and less involve in examining their own concerns. Let's look at the brief episode in which you will see a person respond to a statement two different ways. Remember as Dr. Kagan mentioned in the introductory film, these materials were developed and tested over many years. During that time, hair and clothings styles have changed. Please try not to let that interfere with your learning. 

00:04:40
  Yes, I know what a biopsy, is ah, my doctor told me he would just be taking a small sample of tissue from my breast. But I have a friend, who had a biopsy and sure enough she ended up with breast surgery. Well, frankly, I guess, I, ah, I just have some real doubts. 

00:05:05
 Well, in the biopsy may indicate that you don't require a surgery. Do you think there's a, there are some alternatives that we haven't considered? Are you concerned about the risks? We put all in another consultant. 

00:05:15
  Yes, I understand what a biopsy is, my doctor told me, he will just be taking of small sample of tissues from my breast. But I have a friend who had a biopsy. Sure enough, she ended up having breast surgery. Well, I, frankly, I have some real doubts. 

00:05:40
  And your doubts are? 

00:05:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) What difference is that you observed in the two responses? What effect does each of the two types of responses likely to have on the patient? Watch this next vignette. 

00:06:00
 It's hard for me to say, but, but lately, I've been thinking about getting older and time seems to be, to me moving so fast, I, I can't keep track of it, ah, somehow, ah, things are passing me by. 

00:06:25
  Uhm, well, actually, how old are you? 

00:06:35
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) How old are you? One can't elaborate very much on the question like that. Let's look at the same interviewer, as he attempts to be more exploratory. 

00:06:45
  This is hard for me to say, but lately I've been thinking about getting older and ah, time is, is moving so fast, I, I, I can't keep track of it, somehow ah, things are passing me by. 

00:07:20
 How did those thoughts affect you? 

00:07:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Of course, you and I might have said it differently. But do you see what we are after. At first glance, exploratory responses might seem common place. However, as you listen to conversations of those around you, I think you will be surprise but how little these responses actually used. In fact, most people respond to a person's concern with either direct advice or questions that can be answered in one or two words. There are however, at least two disadvantages to these non-exploratory responses. First, because the person with whom you are talking is not an active participant in the conversation. They tend to be less invested in the information exchange, and thus, less invested in the outcome of the conversation. Secondly, non-exploratory responses, limit the information you receive from the other person. And this information could be vital to your work together. You might think of exploratory responses as essay questions versus multiple choice or true false questions. In the next vignette, you will see two construction workers talking. One has just told the other about the ethnic slurs, he's subjected to on the job. His friend has asked him, why he takes it? Why doesn't he just speak up and confront those who insult him. After the first worker statement consider what you think on exploratory response would be. Then, compare your exploratory response with the one on the film. 

00:09:00
  You know, my friend says, "You'd speak up." I don't know, she started getting angry then(ph) she got and he start labeling you. Ah, you just, you just have to swallow that. 

00:09:20
[sil.] 

00:09:20
  What is that do to you then? 

00:09:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Not difficult to say but how much more helpful than what is usually said. "Yeah, I know. I have a Chicano neighbor or you're right, but don't you think things have improved." Now, why does just sharing our concerns with someone help us feel less stress, calmer, even better able to think more clearly. Remember that when we have a problem, we often have emotions, not only about the problem, but also about ourselves for having the problem. These are usually feelings of shame or embarrassment. When we share our problem with someone who listen supportively, our feelings of shame are generally lessen and our embarrassment about the problem is relieved. For this reason, we so value of people who really understand us, even if they don't help us to resolve our problem. Another point, often when someone comes to us with a concern, they somehow make themselves small, and set us up as bigger or older or wiser. If we are not careful, this can easily result in a non-exploratory relationship. Establishing an egalitarian partnership. In which people can express what is really on their mind, versus an authoritarian relationship, where people tell you what they think you want to hear is of primary importance. Watch this next episode in which a student confides in his teacher about the difficulty he has been having in studying. 

00:11:05
 I guess, I have that trouble getting around and studying lately. You know, by the time I get down from football practice, I'm so tired, I can't do anything. 

00:11:15
 That young man, is known as burning the candles at both ends. 

00:11:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) She means, well. She wants to help, but you are burning the candle in both ends, where does that cliché leave him? There is not the whole a lot, he can say or even feel like saying, when someone response that way. 

00:11:35
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) As we mentioned earlier, a common characteristic of non-exploratory responses, if that the person giving the response is somehow placing himself or herself above the other. Exploratory responses on the other hand, are more flexible and indicate the willingness to have our comments modified or corrected. Could this teacher have resisted the temptation to be the wise in all knowing stage. Could she respond more effectively with an attitude of respect? And more of their willingness to struggle together was the student? Pretend that you are the teacher and this time, try a non-authoritarian exploratory response. 

00:12:20
 Because I have, and having trouble getting around studying lately. You know, by the time I get home from football, I'm so tired, I can't bring myself to work. 

00:12:25
  You're into more things and you can handle, is that it? 

00:12:30
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  So in summary, an exploratory response definitely shouldn't be authoritarian. Not should you force the person into a multiple choice of truthful's type of answer. An exploratory response, needs to be brief, non-authoritarian and open. Watch this next vignette and try to create an exploratory response to this women statement. 

00:13:00
  Well, actually none of the kids is doing very well, and I had migraine headaches for a weeks on end. Some of this is very personal. 

00:13:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  As Dr. Kagan said, in the theory in introduction tape, people know much more than they think they do. Can you see how exploratory responses encourage people to discover their own knowledge? 

00:13:40
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) In the film he also said, "That logic requires language." We cannot determine our actions, all reactions to a particular situation until we put our thoughts and feelings into words. Exploratory responses and also encourage people to evaluate their inner thoughts, thereby enabling them to use the knowledge they already have. 

00:14:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) In this next brief vignette, if you know nothing else about the situation, what could serve as an exploratory response? 

00:14:10
  I've been in combat, and I've seen friends get hurt. That's hard but I can deal with it you know, I mean, I try and help them and do what I can and that is okay. I can still get to sleep. But you know, what's really hard? When someone I don't like gets it. I don't know what to do. I mean, I can(ph), if there is a guy in the outfit that I really can't stand and he gets it, I'm at a lost, I can't sleep. Why the hell is that? 

00:14:50
[sil.] 

00:14:50
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Now, practice an, exploratory response to this situation? 

00:15:00
  Well, he talked about negotiating. So we were negotiating, huh, some negotiation. He talked and I sat there and I said, "Yes, sir, yes, sir and yes, sir." 

00:15:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Practice an exploratory response to this situation. 

00:15:25
  Oh, I'd really like to be able to take some graduate courses. Maybe then get my Master's degree. I like taking courses. Oh, (sigh) but by the time I get home from work, pick up a few groceries, feed Jack and the kids, strain(ph) up the house a little, do a little laundry and get lunches for the next day, I'm just too tired. And you know, Jack never finished college. 

00:15:55
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Of course, there maybe times when it is appropriate to limit the persons next responses. For instance, when there is very specific information needed, do you see how offering exploratory responses in appropriate situations can help someone understand themselves and explore their concerns? Okay, now let's move to the second element of facilitating communication. 

00:16:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) This is called, the listening response, and involves paraphrasing and clarifying. In the introductory film Dr. Kagan, said, "That our need for human interaction, to nurture and to be nurtured, to understand and to be understood is almost as basic as our need for food and water." 

00:16:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) How then, can you better understand another person, and also communicate that you really want to understand as fully as possible. There is a situation you often face in which you use precisely this skill. 

00:17:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Imagine that you are driving on unfamiliar roads and you are almost late for an important appointment. You stop and ask someone for directions. The instructions are complex, keep going straight in about three blocks you will see a convenient store, turn right, then bare(ph) left at the fork and take your second left about four blocks to a white brick building and so on. What do you usually do? You repeat what you remember or understood and you ask for clarification for what you are less clear about. For instance, you might say, "Let me see if I got it." I go straight ahead until the convenience store, and then I make a right return and bare(ph) left at the fork. But I forgot what you said I do after that. Could you tell me again, please? 

00:17:50
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) That's exactly what we want you to be comfortable doing in conversations when a complex statement is made, when you are not sure you completely understand or when you just think it's a especially important to let the other person know that you are really listening. Watch this next vignette. 

00:18:10
 I don't want to take math and chemistry and physics. I don't like that kind of stuff but my parents make me. Don't get me wrong, they are really good people but they do it to me all the time. 

00:18:25
 Well, math, chemistry and physics are very important subjects. 

00:18:30
 I don't want to take math and chemistry and physics. I don't like that kind of stuff but my parents make me. Don't get me wrong, they are really good people but they do it to me all the time. 

00:18:45
 Let me see if I understand you. You don't like being forced to take math, chemistry and physics but I miss some of the part about your parents, could you make that clear for me? 

00:18:55
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Did you see while the teacher did the second time around? If you want to understand what another person is telling you, you check out your understanding with them. This can be a simple paraphrasing of what you believe the other person had said. 

00:19:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) The so called listening responses help clarify statements we didn't understand and serve to make sure we are on the same wavelength. Just as we were going over important but complex directions. You maybe interested to know by the way that effective communicators devoted much more energy in listening, in trying to understand what the other person was saying. Then, in figuring out would they themselves were going to say next. Effective communicators were also careful not to let possibly important statements sleep by. In fact there were sometimes hurt to say, "I'm sorry, I was thinking about something you said earlier, could you explain it again?" 

00:20:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) In effective communicators on the other hand rarely check out their understanding of what the other person was saying and almost never admitted that they were confused. Often leading them to reach erroneous conclusions. Look at this next episode. 

00:20:20
CAROL My job was absolutely boring me to tears. I lived alone, I didn't know anyone. I use to day dream a lot, about finding a boyfriend or any friend. 

00:20:35
 You probably just not the type of move(ph) by yourself, Carol you should have try to find a roommate. 

00:20:40
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The woman response suggest, that she think she fully understand her secretary's problem. And that she has already arrive to the solution. This time, let's have her check out her understanding. 

00:21:00
CAROL My job was absolutely boring me to tears. I live alone, I didn't know anyone. I use to day dream a lot, about finding a boyfriend or any friend. 

00:21:15
 It sounds like, life was really empty for you and you became desperate, is that it? 

00:21:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  You see, it was possible that desperate was much too stronger word. If that is so the secretary now has a chance to correct the impression before the conversation continues. Offering suggestions or advise on the basis of very little information can actually be insulting. It implies that the other persons problems are so simple that you know, the solution in just a minute or two of listening. Okay, pretend that you are alone with this woman and she says the following to you. 

00:21:55
  Well, he, he comes home drunk, nearly every night and the kids. I really got concern for the kids. I mean, what's gonna happened to them? Oh, with all seem so, so familiar. 

00:22:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  What did you hear? Do her words mean the same to her as they do to you? And what so familiar? Most people need to say what they are thinking in order to understand and evaluate their own thoughts. 

00:22:40
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  You see, when we think, thinks through internally we often allow ourselves gaps in logic. But when we articulate these thoughts and feelings to another person, the gaps become more evident. We all have unexamined and often illogical myth we live with. Encouraging people to hear their own thoughts allows them to examine and evaluate their motives and myth. 

00:23:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) By the way, it sometimes happens that paraphrasing or summarizing when someone has said resulting they are conforming or statement and then stopping. It's not surprising therefore that the effective communicators often added an exploratory question after a listening response. In this next illustration, you will see a response which combines both in listening and an exploratory response. 

00:23:40
  Either day I, I just had it. I'm so dramatic, that my car and started to drive, stop and had a drink. Just, just how to get it out of my systems, didn't wanna be something, I'd regret later. 

00:24:05
  You are scared you might do something, so you run? What were you scared you might do? 

00:24:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The main chracteristic of listening responses is that they communicate your sincere desire to understand. Not to let possibly important things sled by. Now, let's practice listening responses in the next vignettes. 

00:24:35
 Ah, schools for girls, the way you treated in the class, teachers like the girls better in any ways. Besides any of the real dudes good in sport stuff, I don't go for that sissy craft. Get along with the teachers those guys are give you hard time. Oh, they'll though think your queer or something. 

00:25:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Again listening is caring and showing respect, it is more than just not interrupting. 

00:25:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Paraphrasing and clarrifying are ways of cummunicating one sincere desire to listen to and understand another. If we believe that understanding is a basic need of all humans especially of people who are troubled. Then, listening responses provide the vehicle to express our eagerness to understand. In addition, listening responses that are offered non-judgmentally also provide the person was a mirror of what they have said. In a sense listening closely to another encourages them to listen more carefully to themselves, helping them to evaluate the rationality of their statements and their thoughts. Can you see how death might happen and there's last vignette. Instead of the argument he might have, have expected from you, you genuine attempt to understand what he was saying might move the interaction to a diffferent level, or one in which the boy does not play out one more argument with an adult about what school is or is not. By the way, trying to understand with someone who is angry at us or complaining to us if thinking or feeling is sometimes an effective way to defuse what might otherwise become an explosive sitituation or unproductive battle. 

00:26:30
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Watch this next to vignette and try to offer a listening response. 

00:26:35
  My old supervisor before this new one seem like a decent person. Anyway, I was new on the job and I told her about the trouble I was having with my husband and I can't be positive mind you, but I think she told somebody. Anyway, I don't trust supervisors anymore in fact, I don't trust anybody anymore. 

00:27:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Listening responses often help the other put their own confusion into words. And when people begin putting their thoughts and feelings into words what comes out is sometimes as confusing to them as it is to us. And listening response should help them clarify their own thinking so that both they and we can understand. Here's, a vignette you have seen before as part of practicing exploratory responses. This time try a listening response. 

00:27:40
  Oh, I'd really like to able to take some graduate courses maybe then get my master's degree. I like taking courses, oh, (sigh) but by the time I get home from work pick up a few groceries, feed Jack and the kids, strain up a house a little, do a little laundry and get not just for the next day. I'm just too tired and you know, Jack never finish college. 

00:28:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Incidentally, when you first begin using these skills they may seem strange and awkward even phony. But in a short time as they prove useful you will use them in ways which are genuine and consistent with your own style. As you find opportunites to use these skills in your personal professional interactions, do so. See if they help. Let's introduce the next response mode by again showing you an episode in which you will see one response and then another. 

00:28:50
 So, I guess this means you might have to remove, ah, you might have to operate? 

00:28:55
  Well, it depends entirely upon the biopsy, we'll just have to wait and see. 

00:29:05
  So I guess this means you might have to remove or you might have to operate? 

00:29:10
  Uhm, if that is a possibility, we'll know in a day or two. This is how very frightening for you, isn't that? Would you like to talk about it? 

00:29:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  What differences that you note in the two vignettes. True, the doctor second response was exploratory but it focus primarily on the feelings or affect(ph) of the patient. 

00:29:40
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) The first response focus only on cognitive aspects facts, data, the actual words. The second, the affective response, focus on feelings, attitudes, fears, emotions, doubts, values sort of like the music that goes along with the words. The doctor second response is much more likely to help the patient bring out, label, recognized and talked about her feelings. The effective communicators often focus on the emotional tones in the communication, we call this type of response affect recognition. And this segment we will emphasize how recognizing and verbalizing the emotions of another can enhance effective communition. 

00:30:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) First, let's think about how we recognized or get a sense for what, uhm, another is feeling. In the last example, how did the physician know that the patient was frightened. She didn't say she was frightened, how that he know? How that you know? Certainly, one way to understand another is to imagine our selves in their situation often we can recognized each others feelings and emotions without an exchange of words or any knowledge of their situation, even when we are not able to identify exactly what the other person is feeling we can usually sense that they are indeed feeling something. We hear the tone of voice, choice of words and hesitations of another person, some of us tend to focus on their eyes or their faces, others on their hands or body movement. Somehow and on some level we all interpret this signals and then react in our own way. Where and how do we learned this? What do you think? As Dr. Kagan said earlier, the two millions of years of evolutionary pressure to live together in community groups with others we are all fundamentally capable of recognizing other people's feelings. 

00:31:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Remember that formal language is a relatively recent development in human evolution. Before language, the only way we could communicate well as with our body langauge, vocal sounds and facial expressions. Dr. Kagan has stated that the ability to sense with another is feeling is a hard wired into our biology. And so regardless of your educational level, we believe each of you is capable of recognizing people's feelings. 

00:32:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) In addition to this evolutionary factors we also learn from our own experiences. For example, when the class bully first push you around or one of your parents let you have it, you began to build a mental library of the subtle and varied signs of anger. As a result we can often recognized fear, doubt and other emotions in the people we communicate with daily. 

00:32:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Effective communicators use its ability to recognized people's feelings they often named what they perceive or they encourage the person they are talking with to name their feelings for themselves. In effective communicators through practice also develop a vocabulary to describe and facilitate dealing with this feelings. Ineffective communicators on the other hand, attend only to the cognitive content of the interaction thus avoiding the affective or emotional aspects. 

00:33:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Now, put yourself in the place of the teacher who has just completed a half hour of instruction. As you look at your students you realized that you have lost their attention. 

00:33:30
  Do you have any questions about the material we just covered? You all understand it? Any questions? You all look a million miles away. 

00:33:55
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Do you see how same what you perceive another person his feeling versus acting as if the emotion doesn't exist can begin to address the problem. 

00:34:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Furthermore, you can choose to deal with the person's feelings on a superficial level or on a deeper level. In other words, you can focus on the more obvious safer emotions rather than the potentially more important but less obvious emotions. Oftentimes these are the more dangerous sometimes had(ph) rule emotions that reside within a deeper level. Less effective communicators almost always a voice that deeper level. Why do you think this is? Well, recall the tend to introductory film. Dr. Kagan said that people need each other yet learn to fear each other. Consequently, early in life we develop interpersonal allergies to situations and people. These fears involve or revolve around being hurt by others, hurting others, being engulfed or engulfing others. Remember also that we establish an interpersonal distance, keeping the pain of anxiety and of loneliness in check as best we can. And when we reexperience some of the bottom-line concerns hurting or being hurt, engulfing or being engulfed in our relationships as adults. That's when we have problems in our dealing with others. That's also when we avoid acknowledging what we sense in another. 

00:35:35
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Less effective communicators never deal with the deeper, more frightening emotions because of their own fears not because of the realistic demands of the situation. Look at this next episode. 

00:35:50
 It just seems that if I really got involve with woman, I don't know she might decide it wasn't worth it. Or I wasn't or something. 

00:36:10
 Would be a bit disappointing of a relationship you would established didn't last, huh? 

00:36:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Notice how the interviewers response although technically dealing with feelings was superficial. It will probably send the message that he was not really interested in hearing the deeper, more powerful emotions. He certainly avoided acknowledging the intensity of what the other was really feeling. This will most likely have the affect of shutting down or turning off the other person. Ineffective communicators do that often, effective communicators on the other hand are capable of and willing to acknowledge the more intense aspects of communication. Now, let's watch the same counselor as he tries to deal more directly and more honestly with what he heard. 

00:37:05
  It just seems that if I really got involve with the woman. I don't know, she might decide it wasn't worth it or I wasn't or something. 

00:37:25
 You are afraid you may not measure up, that you'll be found wanting? 

00:37:30
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Of course, your eye might have said it a bid differently. But do you see what we are after? An affective communicator is able to honestly acknowledge painful or intense emotions in a way that allows people to recognize their feelings and begin to see how these emotions influence their behavior. These responses seem risky and indeed they maybe risky at times but avoiding, distorting, sanitizing, modifying or mellowing feelings can also be risky. 

00:38:05
Ineffective communicators 

00:38:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Such distorting responses can communicate to the other person that we are unwilling to really engage them. The message is perceive as, you heard me but you wont deal with what you heard. You won't deal with the things that are going on inside me, you're nice about it, you are being gentle with me but maybe you think I'm too fragile, too weak or too crazy to face up to what we both know is being said. Side-stepping or distorting responses may also be read as a kind of rejection that is the other person may feel my innermost thoughts and feelings are indeed shameful, so much so that you also avoid them. Attending to the full intensity of the message, communicates to other person that you are willing to listen and deal directly with what you have heard. It encourages the other person to be honest in acknowledging his or her own perceptions, attitudes and reactions. Now, let's take a look at another statement in response. 

00:39:10
  Is that damn bitch of a math teacher. I come in late, she marks me absent for the whole period. 

00:39:15
  It sounds like you and she just aren't getting along. 

00:39:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  You see, the teacher's response, probably would have the affect of shutting down the student which might be the most appropriate response for this situation. But what if the teacher actually wanted to encourage the student to own up to the full intensity of his feelings. Listen to the student again, assume the role of the teacher and try out the response that he's more clearly focus on the intensity of what the student tells you. 

00:39:55
 Is that damn bitch of a math teacher. I come late to class, she mark me absent for the whole period. 

00:40:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  It's important to point out here, that your willingness to listen to another persons complaints, does not necessarily mean, you agree with them. We can help a person to recognize and own up to their feelings, thoughts, attitudes and values without ever agreeing with them. Another point, effective communicators are able to deal honestly but none defensively would even the most bitter of statements, watch. 

00:40:30
  Hmm, well, I guess, this is just one more reflection reserved specially for women. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:40
  And you just don't know who to be angry with. 

00:40:50
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Do you see how dealing honestly with what is being said can be useful. As Dr. Kagan, said in the introductory film, most of the time we do not use the language centers in our brain to attach names to our perceptions or to label our emotional reactions. Helping people put emotions into feeling words is important. So that they can understand themselves better through language. Learning to anticipate and if necessary alter their reactions. We believe that this is literally informing one part of the brain about the content of other parts of the brain and body, essentially we are coming to know our emotions and the influence our emotions have in our behavior. Watch this next vignette. 

00:41:45
 We left the Southwest several years ago, since then we've, we'd run a lot. We get to a new home, we don't know anyone. No one really gets the chance to know us, it's specially hard in my wife and kids. 

00:42:05
 Wife and kids sure, but it sounds like the loneliness gets to you too. 

00:42:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Again, do you see how acknowledging what you really hear can help another? The illustrations we have used so far include painful, hurtful and embarrassing statements. But what about affectionate statements. Isn't it sometimes just as difficult for some of us to deal with affectionate statements? Watch this next vignette. 

00:42:40
 You've been so very kind, I just don't know how can I thank you. 

00:42:45
 Oh, it's okay, it's my job. 

00:42:50
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) What could the nurse have said? Well, she could have responded by telling him what his statement means to her. For instance, thank you, for telling me, that makes me feel good or I'm really glad that I could be of help to you. Why do you suppose it was difficult for the nurse to acknowledge the patients gratitude. You see then that another way to deal with feelings is to reveal some of your own feelings, you will see another example of that in this next vignette. 

00:43:25
  Sometimes, a lot of little things, like at school they say to my son. So you wanna go to college but the act is surprised, they don't do that with other kids, just Mexicano's. 

00:43:45
 Those quite insults really get to you. God, that must be rough to live with. 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:43:50
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  In saying, "That must be rough to live with". The speaker is communicating, "That would be rough for me to live with". A response that he's self revealing and likely to help the other person identify or talk further about his feelings. How? It was Dr. Kagan's belief that we can sense the emotions of another through what we feel as we interact with them, through some cycled process in our own brain, we read ourselves to know another. When we then communicate what we sense. One of two scenarios will probably result, if we are right, the person will likely understood and accepted and they will then go on to explore their feelings further, however, even if we are wrong we will be demonstrating our willingness to talk about feelings. After correcting our misperception, the other person will likely go on to talk more about with their feeling. The next series of vignette are for you to practice affective responses in a variety of situations, you may not identify easily with every situation. But do the best you can for the sake of practice, as you attempt to deal with the affective components of this messages ask yourself. What does this other person seem to be feeling or if I were in their shoes, how would I feel? Remember however, that the other person is still the ultimate authority because only they know what they are thinking or feeling. In this next vignette a woman soldier tells you that she confided in her sergeant who subsequently put a note about their conversation in her personal record. 

00:45:45
  I told him about the stress I'm under and he put in on a statement of counseling. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:00
  Just the thought tough on your girl kiss me off, I mean, my stomach tightens up and I just, what if I called them and they turn me down. 

00:46:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  This last vignette may serve to remind us of the potential benefit of helping people identify and talk about their feelings. First, being understood by someone is one of our most satisfying, nourishing, affirming experiences and as especially welcomed when we are most distraught or confused. In addition, if we can learn to recognize and then label our perceptions to say how we feel, we are in a much better position to anticipate any subsequent behavior. We are then free to chose between maintaining or changing this behavior to meet our goals. Again, Dr. Kagan contended that if we don't know what we have perceived and what our emotions are, we are not likely to anticipate our own behavior or be in a position to deliberately and willfully influence of this behavior. Now, try to formulate an affective response to this statement. 

00:47:25
 I came up here 'bout three years ago to work here at the shop. And they to, they told me, this was a good place to work that, that they treated a man right. Well, there's, there's been stuff happening around the shop and this your foreman. He thi, he thinks that I've been in on it, taking the stuff and all. They lock my tools up in a graven(ph) and he won't let me get out them. Told me, in term to my name that I better go punch(ph) all my time. Now, he may, he may have a right to, to take my job away and but he, but he ain't got no right to take away my tools. I, I brought them things up here with me from, from home. I paid hard money for 'em and I've got to have them to work. Watch this next vignette. 

00:48:15
 Well, I guess, I am a success. I have a tough job, big house, a lovely wife who gave me three beautiful children. It seems like I have everything and yet, somehow, I'd, it all seem so empty. 

00:48:35
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The false skill or response mode is called meta-communication. Meta-communication responses focus on what the people we are with, feel or think about us, what they want from us, fear about us and how they behave with us. Meta-communication responses are intended to answer the question, what's happening between us, as we talk to each other. Perhaps the best way to clarify this point is to look at the vignette and do two things in your response. First, identify what you sense the other person is really feeling, then try to label what you sense the other person wants from you or is feeling about you. 

00:49:25
 There are people who will try to tell you that some wives drive their husbands to drink. Well, let me tell you that I been a good wife and mother and I had absolutely nothing to do with my husband's becoming an alcoholic. As a matter of fact, his father had a drinking problem too. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Well, she seems to be having some feelings about those people who will try to tell you among the various possibilities might be. You don't want people to accused you of having created the problem or using meta-communication. What does she want of me, then label that underlying need or emotion. You want to be sure that I don't accuse you of having caused the problem. Incidentally, do you find yourself having certain feelings about this woman, as you listen to her? Do you suppose that your feelings about her maybe the key to understanding how she establishes her long term pattern. For instance, what it'd be like to be with this person for a time? What meta-communication would you receive and send? Is there a relationship between our meta-communication in the self-fulfilling prophecy that Dr. Kagan's spoke of earlier? He said that we create our own long-term patterns or at least help make them happen. People are usually not aware of how they do this, just as they're usually not aware of their meta-communication. Dr. Kagan thought that the two were related. The second messages were send each other, the way in which we say what we do, the words we chose in our tone of voice speak as loudly as the literal meaning of our messages. It was of these settle messages that set the tone of our relations with others, especially, overtime. Can you see how death would apply in the vignette you just viewed? People generally talk to each other on at least two levels. One is the acknowledge story line and the second is the underlying affective interaction were we sense another person mood and the other person senses ours. Rarely, however, do we put into words all label what we are feeling towards or from the other person. In this next episode ask yourself, what is this woman really saying? 

00:52:00
[sil.] 

00:52:00
  Well, I'm not one of those woman that run around from doctor to doctor waiting to hear what they really wanted to hear in the first place. But I mean, well, it's really hard to know what to believed. I mean, how do you know? 

00:52:20
 Well, taking a specialist is difficult, I guess it's really hard to know what to believe. 

00:52:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  If the surgeon thought it appropriate and was willing to deal directly and honestly with the meta-communication, what would he have said? Could the exchange have been like this? 

00:52:40
  Well, I'm not one of those woman that runs around from doctors to doctor, until she hears what, ah, really what she wanted to hear in the first place. Well, what I mean is, it's hard to know what to believe. I mean, how do you know? 

00:53:00
  And perhaps, you're not sure about me. Like do I really know what I'm doing. 

00:53:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  What impact on meta-communication responses likely to have on people? 

00:53:25
[sil.] 

00:53:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Meta-communication responses or questions can have a powerful effect. In fact, people sometimes refer to the meta-communication for person in fits of rage. "I've had it with you, you always try to pressure me", or "You always whine and set me up as the villain", rarely in our day to day life do we use this powerful response mode as a gift when we are trying to be helpful. What can be achieved through dealing with meta-communication. Well, if we can help people recognize and even anticipate the behaviors they used with us, perhaps they can learn to control and/or modify these behaviors to achieve the kind of relationships they would ideally like to create. When Dr. Kagan spoke to you about psychological closeness and distance, he propose that flexibility was the mark of effective communicators. They could be close when appropriate and also could be comfortable with distance. Just as an hour experience of psychological closeness and distance, behavior flexibility in our relations with others would seem to be the characteristic of an effective communicator. They speak out assertively when appropriate and they are comfortable with silence as well. They are able to listen to others or to go along with others when the behavior makes most sense to them, they also have the ability to forge their own path and to march to their own drummer when that is no choice. Recognizing ones meta-communication patterns can be the key to breaking habitual, unproductive patterns and establishing a flexible behavior repertoire in our relations with others. In the next vignettes practice meta-communication responses to either the content of the messages, the messages impact on you or both. 

00:55:30
  In your class too, I'm scare to death, you're gonna call on me and then I'll have to stand up. Now, those kids will be looking at me, wow. 

00:55:45
  I am absolutely on the wagon, I haven't had a drink in six weeks now. Yes, sir, I am absolutely through, never touch another drop. Anyway if I did take another drink, I know I could stop. 

00:56:05
 I work so hard to get where I am. God, the stuff I had to put up with. In those days it was really hard for a woman. Now, I see this young people just moving right in advancing to top positions, top spots. Oh, I like it. 

00:56:30
  I know he's one of your best friends that you and he spend a lot of time together. But he's really treated me badly. He insist on setting me up for failure, I have spoken to him about it time and again. My sense is that he doesn't treat the woman that way. I think he's a sex's bastard. I don't care if he is your friend, that's the way I see him. 

00:57:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Although we have presented these four response mode separately, specific skills, clearly more than one mode can be involved in a single response. Look at this next vignette. 

00:57:20
  Well, in the other school I knew everybody and they knew me and here, I mean, just walking down the hall, I don't know anybody. 

00:57:35
 Here you're alone and scared. How does it affect you? What is that do to you? 

00:57:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) She ask exploratory questions, dealt with feelings and certainly communicated and attempt to understand what the student was saying by combining the three of the response modes we have discussed. When you separately this different response mode will carry a conversation and different directions. Let me show you what we need. Here's a vignette you have seen twice already. We are going to play it again and respond to it with examples of each basic type of response we have been setting. We think you will see that no one type of response is necessarily better than another. Each leads the conversation in a somewhat different direction. 

00:58:35
  Oh, I'd really like to be able to take some graduate courses, maybe even get my masters degree. I like taking courses. All but by the time I get home from work pick up a few groceries, pay Jack and(ph) the kids, strain up the house a little, do a little laundry and get lunches for the next day. I'm just too tired, and you know Jack never finished college. 

00:59:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) "Well, where does that leave you? You'd like to go back to school, but there are too many responsibilities you are tied to at home?" But I'm not sure on the stand about Jack. Not being able to get what you want, what feelings do you end up with? I wonder what you hope I'll say to you? Again, no one response mode is necessarily better than another but can you see how each type of response could a lead a conversation and a different direction. In the course of our lives we've all used these responses at one time or another. Why then on they used more often. Why do we have to study them. Why don't more people just naturally used this ways of responding to each other in daily life. What do you think? Now, try using each of the four response mode to each of the following statements. You can also try them in real life with our own interpersonal context. 

01:00:25
  Hmm, one day we went to park. There was pony ride all the kids rode over there. Kids like to rides ponies, but not my kid. Well, I'd took him over there, pay the quarter we were waiting we just turn to go and when he starts screaming, really screaming it, everyone was looking at me. Gee, I've, I've just lost my temper. I've really lost my temper. 

01:01:10

  You know, my, my boss and my wife there a, they're pretty friendly with each other, you know. Well, she's pretty friendly with everybody you know but ah, I don't know someone is really going under I, I just, (inaudible ).

  It is recruit really dumb. I mean really dumb, does everything cramming(ph), half a sleep most of the time, half fast really. So I lean on a little bit, you know, few extra push ups, run him a little further, for his own good. The son of a bitch fainted or something. Anyway they got him down at the hospital, they says he's in a coma, I don't believe them, because doctor have tell you anything.
