Introduction to Structured Relapse Prevention (SRP) Jason Dixon, PhD. Research Fellow in Mental Health Alcohol and other Drug Counseling Specialist Queensland University of Technology School of Public Health www.jdcounselling.com.au jdcounselling@me.com 

00:00:00
DR. JASON DIXON Well, thank you very much for coming today and expressing your interest in the field of alcohol and other drug counseling, which is often an underserved population. I find that practitioners, either side they too had to work with, (inaudible ) sessions I counseled the unreliable. I don’t want to work with those clients and then there are others who are very passionate about it, but often get lost, due to… sometimes due to lack of knowledge of choice of modality. And it’s a complex area but it doesn’t have to be as long as you know your limits in practice. So today, I'm gonna focus on one type of outpatient counseling modality, which is structured Relapse Prevention.

00:00:50
DR. JASON DIXON To start… We're just a little bit background on where my knowledge and experience comes from. I was… I did by my PhD in the US at Ohio University, and currently I'm a research fellow in Mental Health at the Queensland University of Technology in the Vietnam Public Health Project. I'm also a Bilingual Counselor in private practice mainly dealing with the Japanese resident population in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. And also I've specialized in alcohol and other drug counseling. Also, I've had some experience in Counselor Education & Supervision in the USA and Australia and teaching at the postgraduate and undergraduate level. My… Some of my other current activities at the moment is consultation with rehab… rehabilitation centers in Australia.

Introduction to a "Structured" form of Relapse Prevention This presentation is an general overview with selected areas where more depth is covered An example of treatment planning has been provided for you 

00:01:50
DR. JASON DIXON So… I'd like to… Today's session is going to be about… I'm gonna call this a structured form of relapse prevention, to start with and then I'm gonna talk about the specific version of structured relapse prevention. And this is a general overview and I will focus in some depth on some of the areas. So I want you to walk away with kind of, what's the process involve when someone walks through my door and sits down and says, look you know, I'm thinking about on contemplating, I'm doing something about my drinking or about my kind of (inaudible ) or about my (inaudible ). I've given you an example of a treatment planning session or considerations for that and a couple of other resources which is a… If you think of, you know a series of eight to twelve sessions this is one right before all the really fun stuff happens with your clients. So, I will get to that part right through the presentation today. 

00:03:00
Overview of general treatment knowledge for Counselors Know about: Generally selected and scientifically supported models of treatment e.g. recovery/rehab, relapse prevention, continuing care The importance of family, social networks and community system for treatment The scholarly research and application in clinical practice The value of interdisciplinary approach to AOD dependency treatment 

00:03:00
DR. JASON DIXON Well, first I'd like to just quickly do an overview of the general treatment knowledge that I think counselors should not… These are the areas I think would be most helpful to know about, and this is just to sort of get you to reflect little bit on your knowledge of practice and maybe this will highlight some of your strengths and reinforce that. So, it's knowing about generally selected and scientifically supported models of treatment. For example, rehabilitation, communities in-patient, relapse prevention and continuing care. So, some clients will get lot of help from you by seeing you in an outpatient type situation, others will… their needs will be served better in an in-patient scenario. But even after that, depending on the level of severity of dependence, clients are gonna need some help further down the track and may… you can encourage clients I think depending on where they've been to come back to see… I see clients at six-month, what I call booster sessions to see if they're still on track, see if there's been any hurdles they've successfully accomplished without my help, which is what we ultimately want in the end. Also is to understand that importance of family and social networks and community systems for treatment, and that's a… to understand the impact on the family and the role that the family can have in assisting the client to meet the goals that they've set themselves with a moderating or abstaining from alcohol and other drug use. It's also about knowing what's out there in the community. When you get to your third session and you realize that your client needs more help than you can give, it's about knowing, oh where do I send them next? That's that referral system, that's important to know and so that you can give, you can provide those referrals and those leads to a more integrated system of help by knowing what's out there in your local community, what the government offers, what community offers. Also it's about reviewing the scholarly research and being up to date and applying that to clinical practice. And there's a couple of ways to do that, it doesn’t mean you have to go off to the library and get into the books and become a bit of nerd like me, it's also about attending these sorts of professional development sessions where the latest research should be, you know provided to you. The value of… It's also important to know about the value of an interdisciplinary approach to alcohol and other drug dependency treatment, including thinks like career counseling, case management. For example, if you have a client who has had a severe dependency for a long period of time they may need financial assistance, you know… and these sorts of things. So it's not that you should have to be an expert in providing but being aware of who else can help this client. I think that's the important point here. 

00:06:20
An Overview of Relapse Prevention Cognitive behavioral approach Tx of dependence behavior Specifically addresses the nature of the relapse process and promote useful coping strategies for maintaining change, [Fruhman & Gordon, 1955, Parks, Marlatt & Anderson, 2004] Dependency forming behavior provides short-term rewards: Feel good - Enhanced pleasure Feel better - Relief physical or psychological pain Feel good & feel better 

00:06:25
DR. JASON DIXON So… Well, where do this whole idea of relapse prevention come from? Well it's a cognitive behavioral approach. It's one of the cognitive behavioral approaches and to see it in that light(ph), and that was originally the focus. It was a treatment of dependency behavior. So, it was looking at the idea of this concept of addiction as a learnt behavior, as a form of dependency rather than a disease. It specifically addresses the nature of the relapse process and promotes useful coping strategies to… for maintaining that change. And it's… And it addresses dependence forming behaviors and understanding that that these behaviors provide short-term rewards. This is why people do become dependent, because they feel good. Yeah! Makes sense? Yeah! It enhances pleasure. It's also used, generally speaking, to feel better for relief of physical or psychological pain or feel good and feel better. And it's important to and address this a little bit further on in the workshop to understand and get a feeling of why your client is using, are they're using to enhance pleasure, they're using to enhance social interaction, are they're using to deal with cope with pain? Do they have a terminal illness? It's these sorts of considerations that they're going to hold you in good state when you plan your treatment and have to assist that client. 

00:08:15
Overview of Relapse Prevention Behavioral self-control to help client's learn to anticipate and cope with potential triggers that lead to relapse [Marlatt & Gordon, 1985, Parks & Marlatt, 1999 Instillation and commencement of coping skills: [a] understand relapse as a process, [b] identify and cope effectively with high-risk situations, [c] cope with urges and craving, [d] implement damage control procedures during a lapse to minimize its negative consequences, [e] stay engaged in treatment even after a relapse, and [f] learn how to create a more balanced lifestyle. Accommodates harm reduction philosophy 

00:08:15
DR. JASON DIXON So, it's a behavioral self-control to help clients learn to anticipate and cope with the potential triggers that lead to relapse. And this is another part of… and I'll address this further on. What's coming up over the horizon? And how do you draw out? How do you work with the client, so they can identify what those triggers are? It's… We often fall into the trap of say what is your use? But that's not enough to cure the client, to assist them to really explore, well when do I use it. They've probably never thought about it and that's how they've lost some of that control. Yeah! It's also an installation and commencement of coping skills. And that is to, you know understand relapses as a process that… Are you all aware of the trans-theoretical model, the stages of change model? Everyone had enough of that yet? You've heard about it? It's important to be aware that people cycle through the stages of change model forward, but they also can cycle backwards through them. Yeah! And that's an important point, because that's a modifiable variable. Isn't it? If we can see that our client has control of their alcohol use and they come to a session, everything is being going right and you find that they're ambivalent again, then they're about to… It's an indication, a red flag will maybe there about to cycle back. They're contemplating to use again rather than contemplating to moderate or to abstain. Yeah! Yeah, good! It's to identify and cope effectively with those high-risk situations. It's about coping with the urges and cravings these emotional reactions to using substances. And it's to implement damage control procedures during a lapse to minimize its negative consequences. Often clients, they have a partial, let's call it a partial lapse not into a full blown relapse, they come in with the… with very ashamed and feeling very guilty and about to give up, and we know that when we identify with our clients too much, we tend to think, well maybe I'll give up to, you know, it's that parallel process stuff that's occurring there. But this is an opportunity to reframe that guilt and shame into a learning event for the client. Yeah! And also I'll now speak briefly right at the end of what's called the abstain its violation effect, which is all about that guilt and remorse, an attribution of failure that the client may have when they slip up. It's important to think here that, you know where do you stand with your client. Do you think they're weak? Do you think that you can support their self-efficacy again? And that's something to explore from your own… for your practice. Okay. It's to stay engaged in treatment even after relapse. That's the important, one of the things, that I personally believe with… working with alcohol and other drug clients is that, they make such great efforts by themselves to moderate or to abstain from use, to change their behavior, and a lot of people will. A lot of people who don't really fit into that medical model of addiction will do okay without us, but a lot of effort is made and when it… and when that helps it… and when that those efforts hit a brick wall and they gage in professional help seeking behavior, they come to you and even though there may be a lapse, we want them to continue to be in therapeutic contact with the counselor. That's one of the most important things. They may not seek help again or consider that failed as well. So that's also something for your to think about. It's to learn how to create a more balanced lifestyle. How to get things in order? How to get life in order after they've had a very drug centric lifestyle? And there can be some, certainly some relearning, reconnecting socially with people, disconnecting with other people that maybe part of their drug lifestyle and seeing that it's a cycle social aspect that really needs to be addressed and you're one of those agents who can assist the client to get that balance. Relapse Prevention also accommodates harm reduction philosophy. And this is… Sorry I'm not sure what the status of the policies and harm reduction in New Zealand, but in Australia it's part of the national strategy. That if people are going to use, we want to keep them safe. And if we keep them safe, the probability of them seeking help is increased. Yes, overtime! Makes sense? Yeah! Okay! So, um, there are several sort of key questions um, that we, that arranges it all or relapse prevention attempts, attempts to answer and the questions about the process and the relapse events. So I want you to think now, if you can put yourself in the shoes of somebody who's um, who's going to relapse or has relapsed or lapsed. And again, I emphasize that they, you know there are specific situational events um, have served as triggers further relapse. What are they? This is what you explore. Um… Are they determinants of the first lapse, the same as those that cause a total relapse to occur? Does that make sense? So, sometimes people will partially relapse and some people will go back to reinstatement of, of um, the same level of use that they had um, before they sought help. Um… If there is a difference um, if there is not a difference um, sorry, how can that could be distinguished? How do we explore? Does it mean that um, an argument with the wife, an argument with the wife um, I’ll drink a six pack. But if I have an argument with the wife, and the boss gets angry at me at work, then I’ll drink three cartons of beer and to, you know… So it's about seeing the client as a… at the unique case um, characteristics of the client, yeah. Um… How does the individual react to and conceptualize the events, proceeding and following a relapse? You know, what happens here? Do… Does… Do these reactions affect the person's sublimate behavior regarding the probability of full-blown relapse. And again I address that idea of um, I've lapsed, I’ve had six-pack where I was only going to drink one every night or not at all um, is my character (inaudible )? Is your client talking to themselves if they've flawed in some way? Um… What is the severity of the shame and remorse that they are experiencing? How can you reframe that, so that they can get back on track again? Um… And also to remember when you are talking with some clients and to be sensitive about this is, is it possible for an individual to covert, covert the plan of relapse um, by setting up a situation in which it is virtually impossible to resist temptation. Um… I’ll give you an example, I have a, a client um, who has done lot of good work around his daily use, pretty much got it under control. Very, very good work. But he plans a six-month camping session with ah, with his friend John um, out in the bush and that’s where he has ah… And John brings all the good stuff with him and that’s where he has his lapse and that affects his life and his family for a, for a period of you know, up to a month, just one, one, one weekend or one extended weekend. So, and he plans that. He plans… He plans that every six months. Have I made any success with this client or has this client being successful as he has because his previous use um, was a lot more severe than, than it is now? But this is an important um, some people will covert, covertly plan. If I meet with these people, no I won't have any but um, do they end up having you know, do they end up using and they actually think, yeah I'd like to catch up with so and so in the back of their minds because well I can get, well I can get Coke, you know, yeah. Um… At which point in the, in the relapse processes, is it possible to intervene and alter the course of events? I won't talk too much about, more about that as that’s a little bit more complex but certainly to be aware of um, where, who, who does the person seek help for, from, when they do start to relapse? The only thing I would like to emphasis here today is, are you one of those people that they feel safe um, and, and respected to seek help from if they're going to relapse or they feel that they have started to relapse? It's keeping them in therapeutic contact. Um… Is it possible to prepare this individual, individual during treatment to anticipate the likelihood of relapse? And this is important to ask this question, because some clients will walk in your door and there will be um, great candidates for this kind of approach. Um… But others won't be. And I will talk a little bit more about this further down the track. Um… Some clients are quite suited to outpatient and to, to moderation whereas other clients will be much more suited to an inpatient, detoxification and rehabilitation and abstinence as they goal.

Structured Relapse Prevention Original form developed in 1996 Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Canada with major changes and updates revised in 2006 Foundations in Marlatt’s work (1980's) Is guided by the Transtheorectical Stages of Change Model Is implemented and informed by Motivational Interviewing Incorporates cognitive behavioural strategies. 

00:19:05
DR. JASON DIXON Okay. Now this particular version of structured relapse prevention, I'll present you with today um, was developed in 1996. I’ve made some modifications and I’ll point those out. Um… But developed in 1996 from the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Canada. And there were some major changes and revisions done in 2006. What I offer you today is my fine tuning or tweaking on that. It's guided by the trans-theoretical stages of change model which I saw lots of heads nodding before, yes. Um… A… And it’s implemented and reformed by motivational interviewing. How many people here have some, used motivational interviewing? Yeah, good! How many people would like to use, thinking about using? Good, good! How many people here are sick of motivational interviewing? No one's gotta to put their hand up for that one I'm sure. Yeah! But this process um, is, it's implemented and informed by motivational interviewing. And it incorporates cognitive behavioral strategies. But it's not specifically a CBT. It's called as CBT (inaudible ) focus, but it allows… I think, it's best done when it allows for your uniqueness of your style of practice is infused within, within this process. But also adhering to the principles of motivational interviewing. 

00:20:40
MODERATION & SOBRIETY Structured relapse prevention accommodates clients who either: Want to gain control over their AOD use and not relapse into patterns that they see are socially and occupationally debilitating OR Want to gain control so as to not relapse into ANY AOD use which will consistently and inevitably debilitating SRP Accommodates both harm reduction/moderation and abstinence goals 

00:20:45
DR. JASON DIXON So, structured relapse prevention accommodates clients who either want to gain control over their alcohol and other drug use and not relapse into patterns that they see are socially or occupationally debilitating or want to gain control so as not to relapse into any alcohol and other drug use which will consistently and inevitably be debilitating. So again, structural relapse prevention accommodates both the harm reduction moderation as an approach and abstinence goals. Both of those goals are, can be met. Yes! 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:21:45
DR. JASON DIXON That now, I’m. Oh okay, which, if they see that, if they don’t become abstinence they will be totally or severely debilitated that may be the, the goal that’s more suited to, to them. And I’ll talk about that little a bit more. Yeah! 

00:22:00
Candidates for Sobriety Multiple unsuccessful attempts to moderate and/or abstain from AOD use Marked and prolonged history of biological and/or psychological and/or social impairment Prolonged history of use that has led to marked developmental biopsychosocial impairment. E.g. onset of use during developmental years. 

00:22:05
DR. JASON DIXON Well, who are candidates for, for, for abstinence or sobriety? They are people who have multiple unsuccessful attempts to moderate and/or abstain from alcohol and other drug use. Yeah! Marked and prolonged history of biological and/or psychological and/or social impairment. I say and/or but in, in general you'll find that, that all of these areas are, are affected. Biopsychosocial areas are impaired. They've had a prolonged history of use that is led by marked developmental biological, biopsychosocial impairment. For example, onset you know, during early years. Some of the clients who, I see as in an outpatient setting they've been using since I was 13 years old and they get to 29/30. And so some of those important developmental milestones that they haven’t occurred for them. And for some, I see they look at their peers who don’t use and say, hey, you know Joe's got a house and kids and a great family and, and I’ve got cirrhosis of the liver. You know, its these, these sorts of things that, it's very diffi… I find in my experience it's very difficult to work with them in a moderation approach. Yeah! 

00:23:35
Candidates for Moderation Clients who have or show evidence that they can gain good insight into functional and dysfunctional use of AODs Aware f a “point of no return” Clients who have a history of self-efficacy to abstain or moderate AOD use 

00:23:40
DR. JASON DIXON Well, who are candidates for moderation then? It's clients who have or show evidence that they can gain good insight into functional and dysfunctional use of, of alcohol and other drugs. They are aware of a point of no return. And we’ve gotto be… We’ve gotto be very sway in, in talking about this with our clients. For some clients they'll say; hey, well, it’s the fourth drink. After the… When I hit the fifth one, you know it's, I’m in trouble, three days, I'll lose three days. It’s a… It’s… Your clinical wisdom will inform whether that’s an accurate point of no return or not. But, so let's talk in extremes here. The client who says; hey, its one drink, it's one drink and I'm going… I'll lose three days or lose a week, then it’s, it's that locus of control issue. Yeah! And to be aware of that. And also to it's, about clients who have a history of self-efficacy to abstain or moderate their alcohol and other drug use. Yeah! Where you can… And that’s the whole idea of motivational interviewing, isn’t it? You know supporting that self-efficacy, if it's there, if it's there. Yeah! 

00:24:55
Factors that may get way of moderation High psychiatric disturbance (Brown and 2002) 12 step program appear more effective However client choice of abstinence or moderation contributes overall efficacy History of repetitive and extreme narrowing of behavioural repertoire which is: Recreational Occupational Exclusive substance centered use Borderline Personality Disorder Antisocial Personality Disorder Bipolar Schizophrenia Developmental early onset of dependency Poly drug substance of abuse Especially those with a physical withdrawal syndromes E.g. Stimulants and Alcohol Mandated or “Semi-mandated” clients “The law or the in-laws” 

00:25:00
DR. JASON DIXON Other factors that get in the way of moderation is, you know high psychiatric disturbance, 12-step program seem to be more effective in these populations. And, however, a client choice of abstinence or moderation, you know contributes to overall efficacy. So it's impairing that client, you know for their goals. I’ve had clients who have totally disagreed with their goals personally thinking; Nah, moderation is not gonna work for you. But I… I’m able to work with them and say; Hey, well look, let's, let's give it a go, but let's come to an agreement where if you have three go's and it's not going too well, let's, let's reconsider what our options are for goals. Yeah! Some clients when before they go to inpatient rehab communities, they’ve done this several times until they come to the point where, no it's abstinence for me. But other clients are quite successful at moderating and the, and the research supports that. Again another factor that, that may get in the way of moderation is the history of repetitive and extreme narrowing of behavioural repertoire from recreational occupational use. So, alcohol and other drugs have fun, alcohol and other drugs get to work, on to increase productivity, and just alcohol and another drugs. I’ll give you an example of a, of a client I had many years ago now and he is, for three months, he locked himself in his apartment and boarded up all the, the windows as a little bit of paranoia occurring for him, beginnings of psychosis. He was a amphetamine injector and had food delivered to his house, and basically sat in front of the TV and played Play Station 3, oh 2 sorry, back then, for, for three months. That’s an example of that extreme narrowing of behavioral repertoire. And that client took a long, long period, long history to get there. And any relapse that he had after the, the reinstatement of the level of amphetamine he used was, was reinstated to that level quite quickly after a relapse. So we would go back to, he'd bypassed all the, the recreational occupational use. He’ll go straight to exclusive drug use, work, work and friends all disappeared and he would isolate himself. Other areas that get in the way are things like Borderline Personality Disorder. Yeah! Antisocial Personality Disorder, quite difficult to work with, in the situational with moderation, bipolar. Yeah! Again when we remember about alcohol and other drugs, it's about feeling good. I mean, that sits nicely when we're, when we want to hit that high, doesn’t it? When we want to hit that manic phase. It’s a little bit of leg up, and schizophrenia. Again as I mentioned development early onset of dependency, poly drug substance abuse especially those with, with physical withdrawal syndromes where you see, alcohol and stimulants used together. I had one, one client and I asked him have he ever used, alcohol use… I said, have you ever used other drugs? Then he said, yeah, I used, used speed. And I said, does that work for you? I’m thinking there might be a, this is back in my early days. Thinking there might be a harm reduction strategy. He said, oh no I'm… If I take speed I just drink more. You know that wasn't a, an avenue for an intervention there. I also mandated and semi-mandated clients. They get in the way some… they are not sure that's, you know… Also the law or the in-laws, who has told me to come, the court or my wife or my mother. Yeah! But sometimes and there are some research that suggest that people have been mandated to appear in court and have been mandated therefore to go to treatment. They actually… They have some good outcomes. They may go in thinking, I’ll go to rehab so I’ll get a lesser wrap over the knuckles from the judge. But they also… The evidence seems to suggest that, it’s a good, it’s a good incident. It’s an incident that seems to get them motivated. You know the decision or balance stuff to, to, to change their alcohol and other drug behavior. 

00:30:05
Structured Relapse Prevention Overview 8-12 Sessions delivered individually or in group context in setting such as: Stand-alone Outpatient Aftercare/recovery Can be used prior to commencement of inpatient or home detoxification programs Motivational Interviewing is an instrumental component 

00:30:10
DR. JASON DIXON Okay! So, structured relapse prevention, can be done in 8 to 12 sessions and is delivered individually or in group context and, in setting such as stand-alone, yeah, outpatient and aftercare recovery. It can be used prior to commencement of inpatient or home detoxification programs. And again, a motivational interviewing is an instrumental component of, of that work. 

00:30:40
Chronological Process Phases PHASE 1: Assessment Precontemplation PHASE 2: Motivational Interviewing Contemplation PHASE 3: Individualised Tx planning Preparation PHASE 4: Initiation of Change Action PHASE 5: Maintenance of Change Maintenance 

00:30:40
DR. JASON DIXON So, there's a chronological process. Phase 1 being an assessment process. In the… This Canadian version of structure relapse prevention, they've, they've put together some nice package of scales, don’t need any great training, don’t take long to administer, it doesn’t look like you're objectifying the client if you, if you administer them properly and with care and consideration and respect of the client and give you insight into the severity of the client's use and also some insight into the drug taking situations that they might be involved in. Get them to, in a way to give you an understanding but also rises awareness for them. In Phase 2, motivational interviewing which is the, at the contemplation stage, thinking those stages of change. Your client may come in, at phase 1 although being, being a contemplator and you do some assessment, but these aren’t, you know clearly demarcated but basically this is the lined up parallel with the stages of change, this is how we move through the treatment. So, motivational interviewing, contemplates their thinking, they being ambivalent, can not do this, what are the pros and cons, do I want to do this? And then on to Phase 3, which is the individualized treatment planning which is that preparation stage. Phase 4, being that initiation of change or the action stage. And then the final phase being the maintenance of change, which is the maintenance phase. Yeah! 

00:32:35
Spirit of Motivational Interviewing Motivational Interviewing Mirror opposite approach Collaboration Confrontation A partnership Expert vs client Evocation Education “Drawing out” the clients self-efficacy Provide requisite enlightenment Autonomy Authority Affirming the client’s rights and capacity for self-direction Provide specific direction at the counselors discretion 

00:32:35
DR. JASON DIXON So… So, for those who, who know something about motivational interviewing, this will be a revision and for those who don’t, this will give you a little bit of understanding of how that… what, what’s the fundamentals of this approach. I’m sure that as, as the profession develops around the world, I won't have to do this slide anymore, but so for some bare with me and some, I hope you find this, this helpful. The… The difference between motivational interviewing and most other approach is, motivational interviewing is a collaboration, its seen as a collaboration or a partnership, rather than a confrontational approach which is, you know the expert versus client, you know. In motivational interviewing, it's, it's about evoking, drawing out the client's self-efficacy and in, in other mirror opposite approach is, it's about education, it's about providing requisite enlightenment. Things like, you know, you are an addict, you know you need to understand, you need to become enlightened, part of that, part of the 12 steps program is based on that. Very good, don't get me your own. Very good. This is… I’m emphasizing motivational interviewing here. It's about autonomy. In motivational interviewing it's affirming the clients rights and capacity for self-direction. Yeah! And helping, impairing them to, to, to choose their goals. I’ll give you an example here, sometimes and I've fallen into this trap before, clients come in with both, you know several different use and several different substances and I want to focus on the, on the alcohol, but they want to focus on, on the marijuana and the speed. And so I think, yeah, but the alcohol is damaging you more. And if I find that I promote this goal that I’ve setup clients become resistant and tend to not want to come back because they are not being heard, they are paying me for service. But if… Realizing that if I focus on, on the things that they want to focus on, to start with they tend to stay in, in therapeutic contact for longer and go on to deal with all their challenges and, and, and, and behavioral problems. Okay! 

00:35:20
The role of Motivational Interviewing Core conditions for change/conditions that promote the therapeutic environment: Express empathy Roll with resistance Support self-efficacy Develop discrepancy 

00:35:25
DR. JASON DIXON So, the role of motivational interviewing is those core conditions for change, the conditions that promote the therapeutic environment, the, the… Your ability to express empathy to the client, you know. So, you’ve tried really hard to, to, moderate your drinking and, and you get to work and, and things just don’t go right and that’s tough. I hear. It's rolling with resistance. So, when there is some defensiveness occurring in the clients about, it’s a message to say, Oh I’m, I’m doing something… I need to change my approach here, I need to back-off. For me personally I tend to be a person who wants to really get in there. Yeah! Let's… Let's… Let's do this quickly and so, you know it saves you money and I look like a wonderful therapist, but as soon as I see the, the, the client becoming resistant, it’s a, it’s a message for me to back-off and give them space, and rolling with that. Let them confront themselves. It’s about supporting self… self-efficacy. If you hear, you need to listen for that in, in, in the clients story. It's things like; Well, I don’t know what is drink? Oh okay, yeah. Tell me… Tell me about that. That’s… That’s important. Well, I don’t drink when, when so and so is not around. So okay, good. So, you have some control when that person is not around. Yeah! So it's supporting that self-efficacy. And it's developing discrepancy, okay. So, it's about where the person wants to be and what’s getting in the way? You know on the one hand, you know drinking copious amounts as fun, it's good, but on the other hand it causes me all this, these problems that harm and I can't be happy with my, my partner, or I can't, I can't finish that degree I started, or I can't renovate the house that, that I’ve started. Yeah! 

00:37:40
PHASE 1 Assessment Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ)* Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-20) Commitment to Change Algorithm Inventory of Drug Situations (IDTS-8) Easily administered self-report tests. Little training needed to interpret results. Feedback of results are provided in the “spirit” of Motivational Interviewing. 

00:37:45
DR. JASON DIXON So… Now, let's just focus on the phases. Now the… The assessment phase, I believe that the severity of alcohol dependence questionnaire is, is important. This is not part of the original Canadian approach. I just feel that I’m, I continue to review these scales. This the SADQ, it captures more of the psychological factors related to withdrawal, yeah. Withdrawal equals potential trigger for further use. I want to know about those. My client needs to know about those things. And this particular scale tends to measure that quite nicely and, and it also, the SADQ, it, it measures perceived rapidity(ph) of re-statement of use. So, how quickly will the client go back to using. It seems to try and capture that which is important too, when you think about how do I help this client? How do I help this client if he does lapse? So, I feel that this, this scale is, you don’t need any training to, to, to administer it, it's self-report, it's, it's in public domain and to, again in understanding how to score, it's easily scored and easily interpreted. There is another scale that drug abuse screening test. This is also available public domain I believe. It's called the DAST-20. It’s a 20-item scale that, that investigates all sorts of patterns of use. Patterns of use. I think originally the, the literature and, and the practice in addictions and, and counseling really focused on, this person is an alcoholic. We deal with alcohol. This person is a heroine addict. We deal with, with heroine issues, but we know from the public health and epidemiological literature that polysubstance use is, is fairly common, yeah. And so, this particular scale looks at and gets at, has a person abuse over the counter substances before. What, you know, do they, do they pick up anything and use any… Do they specifically, find in one or two, two substances and this useful to see what you are dealing, dealing with, yeah. There is a commitment to change algorithm, which gives you a structured way of assessing those great stages of change, that gives you, it can be done within five minutes and that algorithm is very good in getting a real specific idea of where they're at, rather than Hmmm… yeah. I think there in the early contemplation stage or I think there are in, I think there almost in preparation. This helps you. And… And there will be some of you in the room who are, who are quite good at, at assessing the personal stage of change. I’m straight up, but for those who are just getting used to this model, this type of algorithm is a good learning curve, in assessing where the client is at, yeah. And then there's an inventory of drug taking situations, which again looks at, does a person use because you are in pain, does a person use to make good times better, is it more of a social thing? Yeah! Now, it's easily administered again, so there is a self-reported test. There is a little of training needed to interpret the results and the feedback of the results are provided in that spirit of motivational interviewing, so that we don’t objectify the client and so, okay your score is, it's about saying, look, this is what we found on, on the test. What do you think about it? Give them… Give them the results, give them, it's there, it belongs to them in the end. You know, you can give the results of those things, so have a look at that and tell me what, how do, how do you feel about I’m hearing that what do you think about that? That’s a… That's a road into engaging your client and impairing your client, collaborating with your client. Yeah! 

00:42:20
PHASE 2 Motivational Interviewing Including M.I. homework & in-sessions exercises Decisional Balance Feedback about goal setting and commitment to change - “To change or not to change?” Readiness ruler exercise Importance of change Confidence to change How realistic in the long term 

00:42:25
DR. JASON DIXON It includes… It includes motivational interviewing with homework and in-session, exercises, decisional balance exercises, where they weigh the pros and cons up of, of their use, whether they should change or not change. Maybe we'll come to that in the end that, man I'm, I should keep on using, that’s an option. It's an option that… for them. Maybe not an option in your mind but when it becomes of an option and a valid option in your mind it impairs the client to really think about and explore those, those issues that ambivalence rather than just making a decision and moving on, not thinking about it again. Feedback about goal setting and commitment to change, again to change or not to change. You're choosing readiness ruler exercises which looks at the importance of change on a, on a scale and the confidence to change and how realistic the, the, in the long-term is that, are those goals. Such really, that really goal setting, goal setting in that motivational interviewing or considering goals in that motivational interviewing session as spirit. 

00:43:40
PHASE 3 Individualised Treatment Planning Identifying problem substance use situation Coping skills checklist Daily diary 

00:43:45
DR. JASON DIXON The next phase is individual, individualized treatment planning. When you look to the hand-out that I gave you, and if you don’t, if you didn’t get one, if you could share with somebody who doesn’t have one and also if you email me, I'll be happy to provide you with the slides and, and, and any of the materials I’ve handed out today. So, in that individualized treatment planning session, which is the first session in this phase, it's identifying that, you know the problem substance use situations, it’s looking at the coping skills checklist and if you look at, which I think is the second page, it gives you an idea of, of, of some of the areas that the, the client may need assistance with. And it's… And it's keeping a daily diary of use which I’ve provided for you again. Look I won't… I won't go into detail with you. I’ve just given you that so you can go and think about that further down the, down the track. Yes, yes. Also… And it's identifying those, and also sorry, identifying those risk, risk situations. Those risk situations. If you look at the, (inaudible ) to that if you look at the back, I’ve given you some cards here and this is, this is, these are ones that I’ve developed and I usually, this is actually developed from the scale. It's a modified scale. But, oh god if we have to give a client another scale they're gonna go crazy! And it gets in the way, doesn’t it? So, what I’ve done here is I’ve modified the, the items of the scale into statements and I give them at that these, as a set of cards and these are drugs, these are potential triggers, the potential areas of risk and they are able to, what I get the client to do is, to go through the cards and I want you to discard the ones that aren’t an issue for you but the ones that are. Alright! And as they do that, you’ll see a little pile mounting up, hopefully not too big, the more it mounts up the more, more you’ve got to do the little bit of the extra effort for the client, that’s okay. And then I lay them out on the table and see if they group into social situations, unpleasant emotions, physical stress and pain, and then I get the client to choose out of all of those situations and I'll get them to rank the top three. One of the top three, yeah, that happen if I, if I walk by a pub, that's, that’s it. Then I hear the noise and I smell, you know the beer stained carpet, that’s it, I’m gone. So I get them to rank those. That gives you an order to working, doesn’t it? It gives you an order to, to work with the client. I’ve chosen the goal there, you haven’t suggested, well I think it’s the, it’s the carpet stain, you know beer stained pub that you need to work on, it's kind of a revelation sometimes for the clients. He'll say, oh well, yeah, it's, it is that pub, that particular pub and you can suggest would you, well, would you like to work on that one, to start with? Would that be helpful? Yeah! So, it gets them to, to collaborate into the, with the process there. 

00:47:30
PHASE 3 Individualised Treatment Planning Exploration & identification of problem substance use situations Unpleasant emotions Physical discomfort Pleasant emotions Testing personal control Urges & temptations to use Conflict with others Social pressure Pleasant times with others 

00:47:35
DR. JASON DIXON Also in that individualized treatment planning again it's a identification of problem substance use situations and those cards address that. When I... When I said I'll get the client to group them, he put them well, lay them out in the table, I group them into unpleasant emotions, physical discomfort, pleasant emotions, testing personal control. Yeah! 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:05
DR. JASON DIXON Did I do that? Oh, yes, yes! Good point, thank you for bringing that up. Some of those statements for those who've decided to abstain, they work, yes, thank you for bringing that up, very good. Those asterisks, the ones with the, where I find the client is really moving towards or moderations, sometimes I say it up front. I take those out, because that don’t make sense to the client anyway. In their mind, they want to go from ten drinks a night to, you know three drinks twice a week. So, I removed the ones with the asterisks. Yeah! Good thanks. So yes, pleasant emotions, testing personal control, urges in temptations to use, conflicts with others. Yeah! That’s a big one in the, when we, when we know we’ve got a client, who needs to work with and we need, who needs to work on their relationship issues at home, I have a fight with the wife, the beer makes it better. Yeah! Okay! Social pressure, and, and this can be, we think of this as in young people and that’s true. The peer pressure in young people, that initiation to drink and, and these sorts of things or drugs support. But also it’s, if I’ve got a client who identifies social pressure then I, I like to explore what’s the culture of the group. If you decided to refuse a drink from someone, how would the group react? You know, and I find that certain occupations and I haven't look at the (inaudible ) on this, so in occupations tend to have a stronger drinking culture than others. It's important to be aware that mining, mining and engineers, they just recently have had a few clients from these fields. They really stand out as, my goodness, that, they're sort of real strong drinking culture there. Yeah, yeah! And pleasant times with others, you know we always think you know it's life, life is terrible that’s why it’s driven them to drink. But it’s often, I’m having a great time. I want to make it better. I’ll just have one or I’ll just have one more. It can only get better from here. Yeah! Okay! 

00:50:35
PHASE 3 Ranking risk situations Identify 1 - 3 risk situations the client wants to work on and explore in details: BEFORE USING Where were you? Was anyone else present? Were others drinking or using drugs? How were you feeling? What were you thinking? Describe what happened that triggered your use How do you think you might handle a similar incident? 

00:50:35
DR. JASON DIXON And again, I’m using those cards and, and, and also finding those areas, exploring those with your client, and the next step is to identify the, the, the 1:3 risk situations that client wants to work and explore those in detail. And these are some other ways you can get it, some, sometimes I’ll give you enough information. You just tell me more about that and, and I’ll tell you all about those particular situations where they're great pain or they having a great time. And it's about having the client really think about the further, so they're really aware of what that looks like especially for, for visual clients. Where were you? Was anyone else present? Who was with you? Were others drinking or using drugs in that situation? How were you feeling? You’re feeling really happy or feeling, you know things weren't so good? What were you thinking about? What were you thinking? Oh, I'll just have one beer and then, yeah. I'll will take Monday morning off and I should be right by Tuesday or maybe Wednesday, oh forget it, that’s too hard to think about. What are you thinking, now tell me more, tell me more? What happened? Oh, well I got back to work on Thursday, yeah! Describe what happened that triggered your use? And what was, what was there? What happened just immediately and when you made that decision, not only what’s leading up to that, what was, what was the, the final issue that tipped the balance? And... And then how do you think you might handle a similar incident? Do you feel confident in, if you're approached, if you are exposed to that again? Oh, it's exploring that, that’s the beginnings of, of, of helping the person to have some more control over or be aware of those situations that are risky. 

00:52:35
PHASE 3 “Horizons” When clients are aware of what’s coming up on the horizon they can make choices about the journey and destination The Party. 

00:52:40
DR. JASON DIXON So it's about horizons. When clients are aware of what’s coming up on the horizon, they can make choices about the journey and, and the destination. And you can make choices about what kind of Christmas tree you've decided to put up at the beginning of December. Oh, yeah! Hahaha... 

00:53:00
PHASE 3 Dixon’s adjunct to identifying risk situations Situations Confidence Cards Based on the Situational Confidence Questionnaire [SCQ -39] Four Constructs Unpleasant emotions Social pressure Testing personal control Positive emotional states Provides specific situations to consider Offers some concurrent validity to the IDTS-8 

00:53:10
DR. JASON DIXON So... And as I mentioned before... I’ve already introduced this to you in those cards there, they're situational confidence cards, they're based on the site that you know and you can read, read the, the article if you, you like or the work. It's based on the situational confidence questionnaire. And again, it, it fits with that structure relapse prevention model, those four constructs, unpleasant emotions, social pressure, testing personal control and positive emotional states. And it provides specific situations to consider and offers some concurrent validity to the IDTS. So it’s, you know if, if the client is saying on the IDTS that that short scale unpleasant emotions is not a problem, but in, when they're doing the situational cards you find that you had a headache or you get sore from working too hard or what have you in this, then they may have not been really thinking about how to answer those questions. It gives you another chance for getting some validates from them. So, it concurs, has a form of concurrent validity with that scale. 

00:54:25
Cues clients to anticipate risk situations Brings to awareness possible risk situations not yet raised in counseling Can be revisited at a later dates to support self-efficacy and attend to relapses SCQ-H for heroine also available 

00:54:30
DR. JASON DIXON And again, as part of the process, those cards are helpfully, it cues the, the clients to anticipate the risk situations. It brings to awareness as possible risk situations not yet raised in counseling. Yeah! And it can be revisited at a later date to support self, self-efficacy and to attend to relapses. Sometimes, relapse may occur and might be in those cards but it was in the discarded pile. Yeah! But also it’s, it’s useful to say, that ones, well I'll go through those again and that’s one's not an issue for me anymore. That one was one easy to deal with. And for any you who are venturous there is a, a, an SCQ for heroine, there, that scale is, that might give you some ideas for creating a similar type of, of material resource. 

00:55:20
PHASE 3 Furthering the client’s coping skills repertoire-Coping skills checklist Some other areas for clients to consider: Coping with cravings Early coping strategies increasing social support Refusing alcohol & other drugs Coping with physical discomfort Problem solving Spiritually Assertiveness Anger management Coping with boredom Relaxation Coping with unpleasant feelings & memories of trauma Coping with flashbacks and unpleasant emotions Coping with loss Healthy relationships Sexual relationships & dating Money issues 

00:55:25
DR. JASON DIXON So the, the next part of this process is furthering the client's coping skills repertoire. And that's the coping skills checklist. Look, this is an example, and it is not exhaustive. There are other areas, but these are common ones. And... And in, in the Canadian model and there's a great resource where you can, you can purchase some of these or you have some of your own already, and there are some on my website as well. Coping with cravings, early coping strategies, increasing social support, refusing alcohol and other drugs, coping with physical discomfort, problem solving, spirituality, assertiveness, anger management, coping with boredom and relaxation, coping with unpleasant feelings and memories of trauma, coping with flashbacks, then there can be drug-induced flashbacks too, but that’s is not for today, flashbacks and unpleasant emotions, coping with anxiety, coping with loss, healthy relationships, sexual relationships and dating, money issues. These are all areas that potentially the client wants, wants some help with. And it's gonna hold them in good stead. It doesn’t mean that you have to, some, some of these can be worked out just with pure talk therapy, some it's good to provide some, some homework for them to take home and think about and bring it back to the session to work with. I mean if, it’s about you, I’m feeling free to move within these guidelines and provide materials that you feel confidence in using and you know that’s going to be helpful for the client. 

00:57:20
Remember client autonomy in negotiating areas for coping Allow room for the client’s theory of change to unfold within the therapeutic alliance i.e. even though you might have some great ways to cope with triggers client’s have better ones Case example: Greg a carpenter overcomes with Ginger Beer! 

00:57:25
DR. JASON DIXON In these... And I emphasize this again, it's because the spirit of motivational interviewing that permeates through this approach is remember client autonomy in negotiating areas of coping. So, who fills out this? The client. Very good! The client fills this out, even though you think, it's easy, really need some assertiveness training. Be gentle and empower your client. Your... Your... It's a negotiation with your client, you know. What do you want to work on first? Well, you might think that the relationship issue is one is important and will have the greatest benefit for the client. They may want to work on something small first. Yeah! It might be just on that assertiveness stuff at work, just at work. Yeah! I’ll leave that as a thought for you to contemplate. Allow room for the client’s theory of change to unfold within the therapeutic alliance. Yeah! Even though you might have some great ways to cope with triggers, the client has better ones, they own those, they belong to them. For example, Greg the carpenter overcomes with ginger beer. I had a client, we’ll call him Greg and… Oh, yes, yes, yes! Very good! And you're... I'm... It's good you're aware that there is home-made alcoholic ginger beer, yes. I’m talking about the soft drink generic type, in the convenience store or supermarket. Yeah! Good, yeah! Well in this case it was, Greg was looking for coping strategy for when he first drinks. And for him... 

00:59:25
The client describes the most high risk situations they experienced during the day/week. The client describes what they did to cope. E.g. went for a walk, thought of the negative consequences of using if the client did use they record what they used and how much. 

00:59:30
DR. JASON DIXON …he described that his most high-risk situation that he experienced during the day or the week, and the client describes what they did to cope and went for a walk, thought of negative consequences of using and if the client did use record how much they, I’m sorry that was daily dairy, I apologize for that. So, I haven’t finished my story about Greg. Yes, we were looking for a, something that would work for him, and it was him getting home, walking in the door, and going for, for the first drink, and we found that he came up with the idea that if he didn’t put a six-pack of beer in the fridge on the way to work and put in a six-pack of ginger beer that would work and it did, it did. He still have had his sermon... Yeah! Yes! Right! Okay! Good! Yeah, that’s excellent too because that deals with the drinking culture as well. If there is a culture that’s say you’ve got to drink within the peer group and you can have brightly colored cocktail, so I'm just having a cocktail, then not even ask the client, yeah, it is a... which is really good actually, it's excellent. Yeah! I've had... I've seen... I've had some clients say, they have a glass of water with, with a slice of lemon in and they call it a gin and tonic. Great, yeah! But what work... Whatever works is the client's theory of change, whatever works for the client is important. Yeah! Also in this phase as I said, sorry, the daily dairy, which if you have a look in those handouts that gives you a week of things to get them thinking about, what's the day-to-day, what am I dealing with day-to-day with, my, my use? What did the client do differently? You know, perhaps I think of the negative consequences of using and if the client did use they record how much they use. Yeah! So you can keep an eye on... Please be aware, this is art of counseling is that they may minimize. 

01:02:00
Hahaha… 

01:02:00
DR. JASON DIXON Yeah! I see lots of nodding heads, lots of experienced counselors here. I mean, one rule of thumb is to multiply by 3. That's... That’s... That seems to be clinical law not really researched properly any where. But, it's going to be how your intuition and the rapport that you have with your client about, you know exactly how accurate what they're disclosing to you is. If they're... If they're not disclosing to you then what’s wrong with the relationship is the important part. Yeah! 

01:02:35
When you’re assessing a client for or entering a treatment program do you (inaudible ) (inaudible ) heavy drinker wants to stop, but doesn't have the (inaudible ) issues whereas clinical issues in alcohol (inaudible ) a neurotramitter change in the brain, which like they can (inaudible ). 

01:03:06
DR. JASON DIXON Yeah! Yes! Yeah! Look, this is an outpatient treatment if I, if I find clients who, who are, you know obviously there's no locus of control and then one drinks sets them, sets them off and you've done a complete assessment of that. I wouldn't do that so com... to such a level of sophistication in the outpatient setting, but I do, I have advised and I do consult with rehab, inpatient rehab, where I would do a complete psych... psychiatric by biopsychosocial assessment to assess it. I find that some of my clients are in that, yes, are in that category, but they come to me first as the last, the chance of trying to, to cope outpatient. And I find that if I, sometimes I'll get part way through this process and it's not working and then I refer on. Yeah, yeah, yeah! 

01:04:05
(inaudible ). 

01:04:10
DR. JASON DIXON Yes! 

01:04:15
(inaudible ). 

01:04:16
DR. JASON DIXON Yeah! Okay look what I... This is what I say to my clients, I say, this may not be good for you. This may not work for you. I found that certain clients like teachers, this homework, oh yeah that’s easy. But I usually flag, I want you to give this a go, if it, if this is not what’s gonna work for you, let’s, let’s just, I want you to just jot a couple of notes down or maybe we'll just talk about what happened during the week. Yeah! Don’t... Don't see this as strictly... Yeah! And that’s a good point. And I find that it's about, your intuition into their personality as whether this is going to be helpful or not, or they going to be you know or this is going to be more of a burden to them that’s, that’s your judgment, yeah, yeah, good point, good point! Okay. 

01:05:15
PHASE 3 Daily Dairy-Example Tx Plan Chloe quit her job 2 years ago to support her husband while he completes his PhD in Neurology. While she used do drink socially when she started to drink at home especially when her husband is working the late shift at the hospital. Her alcohol intake progressively increased until she was drinking a bottle of red wine every night of the week except on the weekends. 12 months ago she decided to undertake studies at University and expected that she would get some encouragement and support from her husband. This didn’t happen and she feels frustrated and angry. She drinks more when she feels this way. When she gets the chance to go out with friend she drinks up to 24 standard drinks in one sitting. She has had periods of abstinence [up to 2 weeks] with no signs of physical withdrawal. Chloe wants to moderate her drinking to healthier levels and only drink in social situations. Some of her friends expect her to drink when they are out. 

01:05:15
DR. JASON DIXON Okay! Let’s have a look at a quick example here is a case. Chloe quit her job two years ago to support her husband while he completes his PhD. in Neurology. While she used do drink socially when she started to drink at home especially when her husband is working the late shift at the hospital. Her alcohol intake progressively increased until she was drinking a bottle of red wine every night of the week except on the weekends. Well, so I was led to believe, 12 months ago she decided to undertake studies in university and expected that she would get some encouragement and support from her husband. This didn’t happen and she feels frustrated and angry. She drinks more when she feels this way. When she gets the chance to go out with friends, she drinks up to 24 standard drinks in one sitting. She has had periods of abstinence up to two weeks, with no signs of physical withdrawal. Chloe wants to moderate her drinking to healthier levels and only drink in social situations. Some of her friends expect her to drink when they are out. So, what we do for Chloe? Here is an example. 

01:06:25
CHLOE’S SRP Plan overview: Problem use situations: Unpleasant emotions Pleasant times with others Social pressure to use Coping skills areas Assertiveness[in session & at home exercises] Anger management [At home exercises] Healthy relationships [In session and at home exercises] Refusing alcohol [in session and at home exercises] 

01:06:25
DR. JASON DIXON This is one, one way of working with Chloe through a structured relapse prevention plan. So, the problem here is situations are unpleasant emotions, yes, pleasant times with others, yeah, and social pressure to use. So, some of the things that Chloe did was working with assertiveness. We did this in session, we did some, I don’t often do lots of role playing, but this was a client who, this really suited her. So, in-session and her home exercises with her husband, very busy husband. She is not... She is not expressing her emotional needs to him. It's, yeah always ends in frustration. Can I say that I had the husband come in to one of these sessions and that was addressed nicely there in the session, was flagged as a goal. He came once and that we were well on their way and working at that home life stuff. Again, anger management stuff at home, get angry I drink, then I feel angry because I drank, yeah, drank, yeah! Worked on that. I mean, health, healthy relations in session and of home exercise, and refusing alcohol strategies. Sometimes people just need to know how to say no. And I know that’s a terrible kind of cliche, but it's about how to express that, not, not to alcohol, to the person who wants me to drink. Yeah! And... And so this was Chloe’s way an example of Chloe’s treatment plan. 

01:08:15
How far have we come with our client thus far? Anywhere between about 1 - 4 sessions depending on client SOC “I have never been lost, but will admit to being confused for several weeks” Daniel Boone 

01:08:15
DR. JASON DIXON So, how far have we come? Well we must, must feel like a quite of journey, so I’ve given you so much information, but we’ve come about one to four sessions depending on the client’s stage of change. I like this quote, “I have never been lost, but will admit to being confused for several weeks”. Yeah! Okay! 

01:08:35
PHASE 4 Initiation of change SESSIONS Next 1-4 Weekly planning form: Initiation of change Daily dairy Situational Confidence Questionnaire -8 [SCQ-8] ABC Analysis chart Selected coping skills exercises 

01:08:40
DR. JASON DIXON So, the next phase is initiation of change where... and I haven’t provided you with any of this, but... so you understand this (inaudible ). There's a weekly planning form, initiation of change, where the, the client identifies the date or day or weekend where they are going to, to start. Daily Dairy again, and the Situational Confidence Questionnaire, which looks that how confident they are at implementing some of these goals that they've, they’ve chosen for themselves, very helpful. Some clients, they portray themselves with great enthusiasm; yeah, I'm ready to go, I'm very motivated, and you say how confident are you? Oh, well not, when I think about it! You know, I’m not too confident. So, it’s time to work on that. I mean, that starts to sound like ambivalence again that’s working, talking about their confidence. Yeah! There's an ABC Analysis chart which is that, that, so traditional CBT approach and again it’s, if you discover more of those coping skills exercises. Also they have if they have ticked so many of these boxes, it doesn’t mean you've given whole bunch of paper to take home, it’s about really negotiating, well what, what’s next for you. I see, you know we’ve, we've seem to have dealt with assertiveness and, and anger management. What about... What do you want to work on next? Here's... Here is your, your, your list. What do you think? Oh, well, yeah, I forgot about the boredom stuff or the relaxation stuff. Yeah! So, it's introducing the new, new, new goals that or the selected coping skills goals that are ready to be addressed at this part of the process. 

01:10:40
Initiation of Change Plan for this Week: An example: Greg the carpenter [taken from homework exercise] 

01:10:45
DR. JASON DIXON So, initiation of Change Plan for, for this week, was an example... And I’ve already given you this example. Greg the carpenter taken from homework exercise. 

01:10:50
SUBSTANCE USE TRIGGER My goal: Not to drink on week days when I get home from work My level of confidence: %75 My substance abuse trigger for this week: Walking in the door, dropping my bag and going to the fridge What will I be doing or thinking:”Man I can’t wait to get this beer down and relax” 

01:10:55
DR. JASON DIXON And this is his words, if you got back to Greg’s situation, my goal is not to drink on week days when I get home from work. His level of confidence was 75%. His substance abuse trigger for this week was walking in the door, dropping my bag and going to the fridge, what will I be doing or thinking? "Man I can’t wait to get this beer down and relax." 

01:11:15
GREG’s PLANS FOR COPING How can I cope with this trigger? Have a snack before I leave work Replace the beer in the fridge with Ginger Beer Relax for up to 30mins in front of the TV [but get up before I get bored] Then out to work on the shed I am building 

01:11:20
DR. JASON DIXON So... So, we talked about how can he cope with this trigger? And he was having a snack before he left work, that's a, that's a real sort of harm reduction strategy, isn't it? He also associated with, if he had some to eat late in the afternoon he wouldn’t feel like the beer. It was when he was, when he had, had been started become hungry on the way home from work he was getting home and the beer not only stop the hunger, but he was rewarded by that, with the psychoactive properties of, of the alcohol. So, he replaced the beer in the fridge with ginger beer. And as I, as I said it was part of his morning ritual when he got up, made breakfast, have a cup of coffee, grabbed that six-pack and slided into the fridge, was sliding ginger beer instead, and then out to work. And so for him, it was to have that ginger beer to relax for 30 minutes in front of the TV, but get up before he got bored that was important for him. He was aware that, I mean that was first I'd heard of it. He was aware that boredom was also I drink because he is bored. And then out to work on the shed that he's, he's building. 

01:12:35
PHASE 4 Initiation of change ABC Analysis Chart: Activators: Felt unsupported from my partner Behaviour: Drank a bottle of red wine Consequences: Forgot about my frustration for a while. Was late to work the next day. Couldn’t concentrate all morning 

01:12:40
DR. JASON DIXON So, initiation of change for example with that is valid yep… With the ABC Analysis Chart it looks like, it looks like this and I will show activators behaviour and consequences. Felt unsupported from my partner, drank a bottle of red wine, consequences forgot about my frustration for a while. I was late to work the next day, I couldn’t concentrate at all in the morning. And that’s keeping track of that and, and you can use, you can use it with the client in a motivational interviewing approach or in a CBT approach. 

01:13:15
Reviewing the ABC Analysis Chart: Creates the opportunity for intervention e.g. M.J., CBT, Coping Skills Training/Exercises E.g. Assertiveness Exercise 

01:13:20
DR. JASON DIXON Reviewing the ABC, Analysis chart it creates the opportunity for intervention as I have mentioned motivational interviewing or CBT finding another coping skills training exercise for example assertiveness and gives you, it informs the process of counseling as it goes. 

01:13:40
PHASE 5 Maintenance of Change SESSIONS 5-8 Weekly Planning Form: Maintenance of Change Daily Diary Selected coping skills exercises “If I were to relapse” exercise SCQ-8 

01:13:40
DR. JASON DIXON Okay! Last session. So, this session is five to eight now, and there's a weekly planning form there, it's maintenance of change form, again we keep the daily diary and we can look back over. It's good to review the, the daily dairy as well. How far has the client come, support that self efficacy, you know? Tell them that they’ve done a good job. They have been doing a lot of hard work, you know, so have you, but the client's done more work than you have, yeah. Again selecting coping skills exercises they come up and towards the end, it's really addressing this idea if I were to relapse exercise and this is important because it gives you an opportunity for the client to work on attributions and appraisals, cognitive appraisals of what, what would, how would they judge themselves if they relapsed, if they relapsed, and I've mention that at the beginning, this idea of the abstinence violation effect where, damn I've relapsed. I feel so guilty. I feel so ashamed, no one can help me, and these sorts of feelings and attributions occur. It gives you a chance to, to reframe that, to address that they will held... hold them in good stead after you’re no longer working with them. And then the situational confidence questionnaire, where they have their confidence has, has built over those last sessions. 

01:15:20
What if my client relapses? “Abstinence Violation Effect” Emotional level: Shame & Guilt Self-blame Negative feelings motivate further use Cognitive level Ambivalent thoughts i.e. failure promotes just using Self-attributing factors: flawed character, beyond help… 

01:15:25
DR. JASON DIXON So, what if my client relapses? As I mentioned that abstinence violation effect shame and guilt, self-blame, negative feelings that motivate further use. I’m hopeless any way, I'll just keep drinking or keep using. On the cognitive level what you can work with is those ambivalent thoughts, failure promotes just using, yeah, that's beginning to cycle back, isn’t it between those stages of change and it is looking at those self-attributing factors that idea of flawed character and beyond help and it’s the, the your ability to work with those and help, help the client explore those and reframe those thoughts and, and sort of decisions and appraisals that are going to hold them in good stead. 

01:16:15
Reframe thoughts as temporary setbacks Look for positive outcomes what has the client learnt? Revisit Motivational Interviewing approach. [support self-efficacy] Many clients will have multiple attempts at moderation or abstinence. As their Counsellor you need to stay with them…the journey might be a long one… 

01:16:15
DR. JASON DIXON So you can reframe thoughts as temporary stepbacks, setbacks, sorry. You can look for positive outcomes, they lapse, but what did you learn? Well I've found out that if that person comes around, I'm a gonner. Okay! So there is something to be learned here. Yeah! There is always something extra to be learned, depending on how sophisticated the client’s situation is. It's about revisiting motivational interviewing and supporting self-efficacy and remembering that many clients will have multiple attempts at moderation or abstinence. As their counsellor, you need to stay with them and I mentioned this before, if they are feeling guilty and upset about their failure, it's not to over identify and, and get to the same point that they are at where you’ll get stuck too. Yeah! 

01:17:10
[sil.] 

01:17:40
DR. JASON DIXON Yeah! Certainly, and that’s certainly something to address to. I found for, for younger clients that I’ll give you, I’ll give you an example. I had one client, I had to (inaudible ), one for dealing, it’s often the case and one for social interactions and I asked her about these finds, so which one rings the most. They are the one that supplies, the, the amphetamines does, and I said, well so you have come to me, we have worked for a few things you’re getting ready to, to change, you don’t use anymore. How many people from the phone that used to ring that doesn’t ring anymore, do you think you can talk to? And she named several people. And I said, well it's about doing something about that phone and reconnecting with this phone and the people attached to that. And, and after that session, the following session she came back. She said she threw the phone in the bin outside the counseling center. And I came back and she only had, her, her previous phone for personal contacts. So she had cut ties with that social (inaudible ) and had decided to, to she moved house, reconnected with family and reconnected with old school friends and reconnected, but I now remember was her sister was an important person for her to reconnect with. She had spoken in twelve months, yeah, which is good point. It also supports that self-efficacy, social self-efficacy and self-esteem, you know, I can be with people without using drugs, which a good point. Yeah!

Concluding Comments Some clients will benefit from a complete SRP program while others will be best served using select clinical tools in a less formal way. Your clinical judgment and collaborated with your client is important. Adapting SRP to suit your style and client needs A major reason why SRP works because of the underlying M.I. philosophy permeates the whole process. The therapeutic alliance is paramount. 

01:19:30
DR. JASON DIXON Okay, some concluding comments. Some, some clients will benefit from a complete program as these, while others will be best served using selective clinical tools in a less formal way. You can use these notes to go out and explore what else is out there that might be helpful, but in this corner you know approach. Your clinical judgment and collaboration with your client is important. So adapting structure relapse prevention or any form of general relapse prevention to suit your style and client needs. And, and can I just say that a major reason why SRP works it is because of the underlying motivational interviewing philosophy, which permeates the process. In other words it’s, it’s the therapeutic alliance, the relationship with your client that matters and I got right back to the beginning where how do you feel about working with people. What’s your, what’s your moral strenghts on working with people with alcohol and another drugs. I’m really investigating and thinking about that, that’s going to put you in a good spot to be good strong alliances with your client or not. Okay! Cheers, thank you.
