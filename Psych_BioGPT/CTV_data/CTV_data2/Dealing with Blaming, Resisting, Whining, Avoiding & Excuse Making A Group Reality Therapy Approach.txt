Chapter 1 Introduction 

00:00:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING My name is Robert Wubbolding. And I'm the director of training for the William Glasser Institute and the Director of the Center for Reality Therapy. This is a demonstration, a role-play demonstration of reality therapy applied to groups. We do role-play, because we can demonstrate more skills more, more techniques and we can do this much work in, in about. Well, we can do this much work in this much time. In other words, we can collapse the time to some extent if it's a role-play. Also we do role-play, because sometimes, if you do real counseling in front of a groups, people open up issues that maybe they regret later that they opened up. And, and also we want to get your type of, your clients type of issues rather than your own issues to deal with. So you came for training, and you're watching this video for training, not necessarily for therapy. So, that's the reason for doing the role-play. I would suggest as we go through this that you look for ideas that you can take from this and transfer to another setting. This will be a session where we do counseling in a mental health clinic of some kind. And many of you who view this tape or who are listening live to this work at schools, or other kind of agencies, child care agencies, probation, parole, etcetera and… so your setting is different, but the process of reality therapy is not that radically different. No matter where you're working. So, you might look for ways to transfer what you see in here. I suggest also that you look for the concepts about uh… concepts and choice theory. Look for such things as the needs as we discuss the need for survival or self-preservation as it comes out in the, in the session. Look for the need for belonging to give and receive love and belonging. Look for how the need for power or inner control plays out with the individuals. Look for also how they express their need for freedom, or independence, or make, or, or choices that they've made. And certainly, look for fun, or enjoyment. Not all of these will be illustrated probably, but some of them more than likely will be. Also look for the use of reality therapy. I'll do my best to use reality therapy in this session, or lead management uh… as it is applied in management and supervision. Look for the W, D, E, P formulation of reality therapy. The wants, the perceptions, and the D look for total behavior the doing the actions, the thinking, the feelings. Look for E, self-evaluation, and the P look for the plan. We may not get to a plan, I really don't know. Also look for the stages of group development. According to (inaudible ) the stages are the initial stage, the facilitative stage, the working stage, and the termination stage. I almost forgot the termination stage, because we never get the termination stage in these, in these demonstrations. Another formulation of group development is that of Yalem(ph) the group, the group forms, the group norms, the group storms, and the group performs. In other words, there's a process first getting together, setting some guidelines, spoken or unspoken, there's always some conflict, and then we hope that some work uh… ultimately is the outcome of a session. We're going to assume that the professional details have been handled such as issues around informed consent, limitations of confidentiality, the fact that the no illegal material should be brought into the group, no weapons, and, and the rest of it. So these are some of the issues that we're going to presume that have been handled. The reason I want to presume that they've been handled is that handling those issues is no different in reality therapy than it is in any method of counseling. And I want to demonstrate specifically what can be done using reality therapy. So those are some things to look for as we as you view, view this videotape.

Chapter 2 Group Inclusion:Looking for Commonalities 

00:04:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So here we are at the, Happy Hour Counseling Center. Okay. And my name is Bob, and you can call each other by our names, our first names if you care too. And my question to each of you or to all of you is… what do you think about being here? 

00:05:00
[sil.] 

00:05:05
GARY It's okay. 

00:05:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay? 

00:05:05
DOMINICA I'm not too happy about it, because you get here or jail. 

00:05:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Not too happy about either jail or here. Okay. 

00:05:15
MALA I'm not happy at all. 

00:05:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Not happy at all. Okay. 

00:05:20
SHERRY Yeah, there's other places I'd rather be. 

00:05:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:05:20
JERRY My wife made me come. 

00:05:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:05:25
ALISON Yeah, I, I hope to get a little help. 

00:05:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Were you excited about being here or…? 

00:05:30
ALISON No, no, no. 

00:05:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Not. Not too excited, you, you were kind of sad I guess? 

00:05:35
ALISON No, no. I mean, I, I, my doctor said I should get some counseling that when I got. 

00:05:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. 

00:05:40
ALISON I don't know. This group is cheaper. 

00:05:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. That's one thing it is it's cheaper. Yeah, so I, I think, it's very interesting that nobody came here, enthusiastic, excited, saying I just can't wait to go to that Counseling Center. Would that be true? 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Pretty much, yeah. 

00:06:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, this is interesting, because it's, it's something you have in common. Everybody is maybe not courage(ph), but let's say encouraged to come. You know, oftentimes I, I talk to groups at the center, and they have nothing in common, but you all seem to have something in common. I can see you're not just excited about that either. Okay, well, let me ask you this. What did you think what happen when you came here? 

00:06:45
CRT Exploring expectations or wants. 

00:06:45
GARY You have to talk 

00:06:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Have to talk. Okay. 

00:06:50
DOMINICA And start, come listen and we talk at. 

00:06:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:06:55
JERRY It will make my wife happy that I'm in. 

00:06:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right! 

00:07:00
SHERRY I just thought I'd hear other people's problems. 

00:07:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! Anybody else, what did you think that happened? Al? 

00:07:05
ALISON Well, I thought maybe if, my, my doctor wants me to take medication notice that I don't, I don't want to do that. So I'm, I'm hoping you'll help me figure out how to get better, we are doing that. 

00:07:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Mala, what did you think about them? 

00:07:25
MALA I umm… I umm… thought I, I come because umm… my doctor suggested it and I wanna do whatever I can. This is one of the, one of the thing and so that's why to please my doctor and as well, as I am and what somewhat pleased myself that I'm doing something cooperating. 

00:07:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so each of you came for some reason. And you thought something might happen. Is that accurate? Am I, am I on base with that? 

00:08:00
MALA Yeah. 

00:08:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You thought something might happen, at least, it might, not for sure, but it might happen. 

00:08:05
MALA Okay. 

00:08:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So, that's interesting that you have two things in common. Something might happen, and you're sort of encouraged or maybe pushed into coming here and with, with varying degrees, varying degrees of push. Okay, another question. And you kind of said this to some extent already a few of you umm… what sdid, what did they say when they sent you? Sherry, what did they say? Why did they say you should come? 

00:08:45
SHERRY My aunt is basically making me come otherwise I have to get out of the house. 

00:08:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Umm…okay, so somebody else wants something from you? 

00:08:55
SHERRY Yes. 

00:08:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Does she want some kind of a change? 

00:09:00
SHERRY Yes, she says, I have a bad attitude. 

00:09:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, okay, okay. All right! Alison, how about you? 

00:09:05
ALISON Well, George thought it might be a good idea. Umm… I just, I get, I, I get mad at everything. I get mad all the time, everything. And then I understand why I'm mad at everything and but everyone is so awful and so George, you know, he said maybe it would help if I talked about it with somebody else. 

00:09:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Umm… okay, so what do you think he wants from you? 

00:09:40
ALISON I don't know. 

00:09:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, you could just guess. 

00:09:45
ALISON I think, George wants me to get along better with his parents. And, and I think, he wants me to be happier. 

00:09:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:09:55
ALISON Yeah. Dominica, how about you? 

00:10:00
DOMINICA The reason I came here is out of treatment counseling for, I was going to spend time, few days in jail. 

00:10:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Umm…okay, so the judge evidently wanted something from you and said you better come here. 

00:10:10
DOMINICA No. 

00:10:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And Jerry, how about you? What did they say? 

00:10:15
JERRY My wife thinks that, I don't pay enough attention to her. She is gonna leave me again. 

00:10:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And she's done that before? 

00:10:25
JERRY We've separated for a year. 

00:10:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so she's apparently not kidding. 

00:10:30
JERRY No, she's not. 

00:10:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Gary, how about you? What did they say? 

00:10:35
GARY Well, basically my wife is encouraging me to come here and now, exactly sure why, but I'm, I'm recovering and adding alcohol and so I've used two groups AA and A. 

00:10:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:10:50
GARY Umm… that's why I think I get my recovery. I don't, I don't know about here though. 

00:10:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, it's little hard to tell that. Isn't it? 

00:10:55
GARY Yeah. 

00:11:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. So, so someone said to come and, you know, what did they want to have happen? 

00:11:05
GARY Talk more, be more sensitive, stop isolating. 

00:11:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Umm…okay, okay. Mala, how about you? 

00:11:15
MALA Well, my, my doctor suggested that I'm, I need therapy and umm… because I'm depressed, and angry, and then I went to his counselor. And the counselor said, umm… it's better for me if I'm in group sitting. 

00:11:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I see. 

00:11:35
MALA And I don't know, why? 

00:11:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so they sent you. You're not excited about being here and somebody outside of this group wants some change, or they want something from you that apparently that are getting? Would that be accurate? 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:11:50
ALISON Well, I want to change too. 

00:11:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh! 

00:11:55
ALISON I wanna quit being so angry all the time. 

00:11:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay, that's interesting. So you actually feel, you know, inside that you want to make some progress somewhere along the line. 

00:12:05
ALISON I, I hope so. I'm sure not happy now. 

00:12:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Does anybody else feel that way? Anybody else feel the need to do something different in your life that you're not doing now? 

00:12:20
MALA I, I feel, I uh… my, my, my life is so measurable right now. I think, I, I think, something has to happen, but I have done everything is… 

00:12:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! 

00:12:30
MALA …me. I asked, I think my husband should be here, not for me, but I'm the one who is trying… 

00:12:40
ALISON Yeah, yeah, I think my in-laws should be here, they're… 

00:12:45
MALA I don't think that is there anything wrong with me. It's that my husband make me so mad. 

00:12:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. I have two questions now. One is uh… one is, do you think, is there anything you would like to have, you know, change in your life? I don't mean other people, is there anything you think, you would like to change? 

00:13:05
MALA No, not. 

00:13:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Would you or, I mean, I'm trying to ask you, are you, you're interested in doing something for somebody else? I mean, you're here for them, is that the idea? 

00:13:20
MALA Well, I umm… I don't know how, how to, how to say, except just say it, it's umm… my husband, it's umm… my husband retired about a year and half ago and, and just gradually almost like flip. He's very depressed. I know, he's depressed and, and everything was fine. There was nothing wrong and, and it's like, I'm losing my life. 

00:13:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:13:55
MALA And I don't wanna lose my life. I don't wanna lose my marriage. Nothing, it's just pisses me off. 

00:14:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:14:00
MALA I can't do anything. 

00:14:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so let's, let's come back to that. Uh… my second question is going to be uh… do you think someone else should change? 

00:14:10
MALA Yeah. 

00:14:15
CRT Focusing on participants own behavior. 

00:14:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Let's, let's, let's come back that. Does anybody else think that maybe there's some change you'd like to make in your own lives? Anybody on this side? 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN No, no. 

00:14:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So everything is okay? 

00:14:25
JERRY Yes. 

00:14:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Everything is fine? 

00:14:25
JERRY Yes. 

00:14:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Everything is fine 

00:14:25
JERRY Just my old lady. 

00:14:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:30
ALISON I don't know what you mean? 

00:14:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, you said you wanted to make some changes yourself? 

00:14:30
ALISON Yeah. 

00:14:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay! 

00:14:35
ALISON I want to change how I feel. 

00:14:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. So Alison, yeah, Alison wants to change how she feels. Gary, how about you? 

00:14:40
GARY Well, I've been recovery for two years. And I know, I made a lot of changes. Umm… I was in the madness. But I feel I'm kind of stuck. 

00:14:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:14:50
GARY I'm not sure exactly how I'm stuck. 

00:14:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Mm-hmm! 

00:14:55
GARY So, maybe getting on stuck from something would be helpful. 

00:14:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, uh… and you would like to, to make some changes to get going. Is that the idea of stuck means you're stopped? 

00:15:05
GARY Yeah, I'm not, I mean, somehow I'm bogged down in my relationship with my wife and my kids. But umm… sometimes, I think, it's them, sometime I think it's me, but I'm not really sure. So I'm just running get somewhere. 

00:15:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay, okay. Umm… and nobody over here thinks that you need to change. Okay! 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN No. 

00:15:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I need to get the clinic to change, you know, to buy some bug spray. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So we all want somebody else to change, uh? 

00:15:40
DOMINICA I do. 

00:15:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, all right. Is that true, you think somebody else to change? 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, over here. 

00:15:45
MALA Sure. 

00:15:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING To some extent. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:50
GARY Yeah, yeah, sure but mostly something's not right. 

00:15:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, something's not right. 

00:15:55
GARY Sometime. 

00:15:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that's, that's an interesting way to put it. Would, would anyone else feel that something is not right? Something is not going the way you want it to go? 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Totally true. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah, yeah. 

00:16:05
DOMINICA Yeah, I wouldn't be here. 

00:16:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, you wouldn't be here. You're all here, because you, sounds like you're, I mean, that's what sound like an enthusiastic response. I mean, at least the most enthusiastic I've heard hear that something should change. So you all agree with that? 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, not my, me. 

00:16:20
CRT Group shows initial desire for change 

00:16:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I, I, I didn't say about you, but some, something's that Alison thinks she wants to make some changes, and Gary said that too. Umm… but most of you think something should change, would that be accurate? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN We agree. 

00:16:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! I mean, you, you have a lot in common as a group. Doesn't seem like it, I guess, I'm judging from the way you, you look about that. 

00:16:45
MALA I don't feel I'm having anything in common with Gary. 

00:16:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Umm…yeah, yeah. We will see if it, if it develops some? 

00:16:50
MALA Okay. 

00:16:55
Chapter 3 Indirectly Exploring Behavioral Direction 

00:16:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so well, let me ask you this. Uh… if, if someone were to change somebody other than you all, how would that impact your life? How would, what effect would that have on you? 

00:17:10
MALA I'd be happy. 

00:17:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You'd be happy if somebody out there changed? 

00:17:15
MALA My husband. 

00:17:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Your husband, yeah, sure. Okay, Dominica, how about you? 

00:17:20
DOMINICA I'd probably be happier. 

00:17:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You'd be happier. 

00:17:25
DOMINICA If my mother changed. 

00:17:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING If your mother, okay, okay, okay. Sherry, how about you? 

00:17:30
SHERRY I'd be relieved my aunt and uncle would just lay off. 

00:17:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:17:35
SHERRY I'm 19, I'm, I can do what I want. 

00:17:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. Okay, Jerry? 

00:17:40
JERRY I thought, we're moving back together. Everything was fine. 

00:17:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. So if they changed, how would your life be better? 

00:17:45
JERRY Well, she'll talk to me more and… man, it's not easy playing in a cold bed. 

00:17:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay. Gary, how would your life be change, be better if somebody else changed? 

00:18:00
GARY My wife change, we get more sex. 

00:18:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Umm… okay. 

00:18:05
ALISON Well, I think, you know, I would really like in it, if my in-laws will give me more credit for being loyal to their son. I mean, I go and visit him every Saturday and every Sunday, and I work Monday through Friday, and I have no time to myself, but that's what I do. I go and see him every Saturday and Sunday. They don't go visit him that much, but I do that. And they don't give me any credit for being loyal to them. I don't get anything. I don't get any appreciation from them, just criticism. 

00:18:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, so your life would be better, if they would appreciate you? 

00:18:40
ALISON Yeah! 

00:18:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. And while I think you said if, if uh… things change, your life would be happy, it wouldn't be so depressed or angry. Is that right? 

00:18:50
MALA Absolutely! That's, that's all I want. 

00:18:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:18:55
MALA That's all. 

00:18:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! 

00:18:55
MALA And I have done everything in my power. 

00:18:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure, sure. What was that? 

00:19:00
MALA I've done everything in my power. 

00:19:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh! You've done everything in your power to do what? 

00:19:05
MALA To… umm… to make in, to make in my, get help, and get over these depression and… 

00:19:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. 

00:19:20
MALA …that's, this is the last, this is the last thing I can do. There is nothing else I can do and, and don't just miserable and Just mad. 

00:19:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:19:30
MALA I just can't believe… 

00:19:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, I certainly don't blame him. Uh… is anybody else done everything in your power to get those other people to change? Gary? 

00:19:35
JERRY Yeah! 

00:19:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Nodding your head?

00:19:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Dominica, how about you? 

00:19:50
DOMINICA Well, my mom, she's sick, and she's dying from cancer. But, she doesn't want to do the treatment so… 

00:19:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:19:55
CRT Common problem:misery and unhappiness. 

00:19:55
JERRY …you know, and because I'm in the healthcare field, she thinks I should come over and you know, just take care of her and that's, that's hard for me. 

00:20:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! 

00:20:05
DOMINICA It's hard and that's why I was trying to settle medicated. 

00:20:10

00:20:15
DOMINICA And it just it wasn't worked. 

00:20:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING But if you've tried to get her to do what you want her to do? 

00:20:20
DOMINICA She won't. She refuses… 

00:20:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING She refuses, you know, that's that makes things pretty tough. Sherry, how about you? 

00:20:25
SHERRY I wanna live my life. And I want my aunt and uncle to live their life, I. 

00:20:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Have you ever tried to get them to let you alone? Have you tried as, as Mala said, with all your power? That's best you can do to try to get these people to change. 

00:20:40
SHERRY Yes, I, I, I guess, I'm sure there's other things I could do but… 

00:20:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Would you have tried? 

00:20:45
SHERRY Sure. I argue or I ignore them or just… 

00:20:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, Gary or Alison, how about both of you? 

00:20:55
ALISON Well, to George, he used to tell his parents to, to, you know, to take, to do things differently, not treat me this way, but you know, I can't tell them. I can't just, I can't talk to them about it. They're, they just, they're, I don't, you know it, and it makes me mad to see them happy together too, because I don't have George and they've got each other. And I think, they throw that in my face. 

00:21:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:21:20
ALISON I have told George that and he just, he wont talk to me. 

00:21:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So you've, but you have tried to get people to do some things. I mean, that's the impression I'm getting, would that be accurate? 

00:21:30
ALISON Everything then I can't think of anything else. 

00:21:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay, okay. Gary, how about you? 

00:21:35
GARY Well, I'll go into two, three meetings a week. 

00:21:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:21:40
GARY Umm… stay in a clean and sober, I feel like I'm working the program, umm… and my wife doesn't still seem to, you know, happy enough about that. And umm… she says, I, I isolate too much. So… I don't know what exactly what that mean, because I go on meetings. 

00:22:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well. Yeah, I understand that, but are you satisfied with the way she talks to you and all that and… 

00:22:05
GARY Well, not really. 

00:22:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, I mean, my question is, have you tried to get her to change? 

00:22:10
GARY Oh, yeah, I'm sure. 

00:22:15
Chapter 4 Self Evolution:Have Your Choices Been Effective? 

00:22:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Now I have a question for all of you. Judging from what you've said, that's another thing you have in common, you've tried at least with all your power or with some of your power, and you made some efforts to try and get these other people to change so that your lives can be better. 

00:22:35
JERRY Yes. 

00:22:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm! 

00:22:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And then some of you have said you wanna work on some things that's true. But I mean, that right now, I wanna just ask you and you all are nodding to that question. Yes, I've tried to get other people to change. Now, I have a really key question to ask. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You wanna hear? 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:00
ALISON Go ahead, yeah. 

00:23:00
CRT Group transitions to higher energy level. 

00:23:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING The key question is, I don't know if you're ready for it. I guess you are. How has that worked? 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:20
JERRY It isn't working though, that's, that's probably… 

00:23:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, you're certainly in agreement about that trying to get these other… 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Well, we didn't need to come here, to hear you say that. 

00:23:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, that's, that's the interesting point, but trying to get these other people to change does not work. 

00:23:30
GARY Well, it's not true. I mean, I've been in recovery, my wife was happy about that, but still where some doesn't seem right. 

00:23:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. I mean, but you have tried to get her to change her behavior. 

00:23:40
GARY Yeah. 

00:23:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, and that was my question, how's that worked? And you all agreed that it, that it hasn't worked. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Well. 

00:23:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Alison said, you kind of knew that already. 

00:23:55
ALISON Yeah. 

00:23:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:23:55
GARY What I seem to do right now makes her really, really happy. 

00:23:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Makes her, nothing you do, you say. 

00:24:00
GARY Not much, well, it's not true. I mean… 

00:24:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sometimes. 

00:24:05
GARY …in recovery, I'm not go out and using cocaine. 

00:24:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, she's probably happy about that. 

00:24:10
GARY I think so yeah, absolutely. 

00:24:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so other people are at varying degrees of satisfaction with, with what you're doing. Some are extremely unhappy, some are somewhat happy, etcetera, etcetera. Okay. So my main question is, is trying to get other people to change getting you what you want? 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN No, no. 

00:24:30
ALISON No, that's why we, I come here. 

00:24:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's why you're here. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. Now my next question is, are you willing to try something different other than getting other people to change? 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:24:50
MALA Well, yeah, I mean, I'm committed to… 

00:24:50
ALISON Yeah, what should, yeah, what is it? 

00:24:55
MALA …to do my… 

00:24:55
CRT Group begins to see leader and counseling process as potentially helpful. 

00:24:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, that's what this is about. That's what this is about. Doing something different than what you've tried, because these, as you said, what you've tried that is to get other people to change has not worked. Now, that leads another person in your lives that you might consider taking a look at, and who would that be? 

00:25:20
GARY Well, I know, I'm responsible for my recovery. 

00:25:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:25
GARY Umm… nobody can make me go to meeting. 

00:25:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Right. 

00:25:25
GARY And nobody can make me stay clean and sober, talk to my sponsors. I mean, I'm, I'm responsible for that. My wife doesn't know that, that's what I've learned in the program. 

00:25:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's right. So you learned a valuable lesson. 

00:25:35
GARY Yeah. 

00:25:40
JERRY So I have to work on my marriage better? Is that what you're telling me? 

00:25:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING What do you think? 

00:25:50
JERRY Yes, that's the answer. 

00:25:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:25:55
MALA Well, I have been working on my, on my marriage. And I have been, I have been married for over 13 years. And umm… so obviously I'm committed. I don't wanna be divorced and, you know, umm… years ago, one of the therapists that we went to uh… said, "Yeah, you have to be happy with yourself." 

00:26:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:26:25
MALA Well, that was the good, good line, but umm… but marriage is about two people. And he cannot, he cannot make me happy. No, I am not making happy or what do you do when he's just completely depressed and my, my marriage is on the line and you… 

00:26:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:26:45
MALA …it's nothing I can do. 

00:26:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that's why you're here. 

00:26:50
MALA Yeah, right. 

00:26:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING To make the marriage happy. 

00:26:50
MALA And I want to do whatever I can. 

00:26:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, that's what, what we can work on. 

00:26:55
MALA Okay. 

00:26:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay? Okay, so you, you've agreed that trying to get these other people to change so that your life can be better hasn't worked and uh… you might consider the possibility of working on something that you can control a little bit more and that might be what? If you can't control other people's actions, who's left? 

00:27:20
JERRY Me. 

00:27:20
ALISON But I, I can't control, I can't, I can't, I get mad all the time. And I, I tell myself not to get mad. It doesn't work. 

00:27:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:27:30
ALISON So, I don't know what you're talking about. 

00:27:30
MALA I don't know, I don't understand what you're taking. 

00:27:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, who can help out? Who can explain? 

00:27:35
JERRY I guess, we're responsible for our own actions and I guess, that's what he's trying to tell us. 

00:27:40
ALISON But, anger is not an action, it's feeling, how I feel. I can't, I can't, it's just in there. I cant… 

00:27:45
DOMINICA You choose to be angry. You choose to have that feeling. 

00:27:50
DOMINICA I won't be bother with you saying all. 

00:27:50
ALISON That's, that's… I'm not choosing that. 

00:27:55
CRT Group demonstrates conflict 

00:27:55
DOMINICA Sure you are? You let most people upset you. I wouldn't give them the time of it. 

00:27:55
MALA What I… 

00:28:00
DOMINICA And that will solve your problem right there. 

00:28:00
MALA I don't know, I don't understand what you're talking about. I don't understand what you're saying. 

00:28:05
ALISON You mean, don't care about what they do and don't care that they don't. 

00:28:05
DOMINICAS You know, I'm married to those in-laws. 

00:28:05
ALISON Appreciate me. I live with them. It's… 

00:28:10
DOMINICA You live with them. 

00:28:10
ALISON Well, I have to. I can't afford to live on my own. I've got a baby. I, I can't support. I can't support us. I don't know how long I'm gonna be able to do that, because I can't do that forever. I don't know how long he's gonna be in prison, but keep, but it's yeah, they're there all the time. 

00:28:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So we have some disagreement about these things. 

00:28:35
DOMINICA Oh, yeah. 

00:28:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, Sherry, what do you think? 

00:28:40
SHERRY I think, I am hearing a lot of whining, just go and do. 

00:28:45
JERRY Do what? 

00:28:45
DOMINICA This for the 19 year old who's living with their aunt, uncle. Move out, you're grown. 

00:28:50
SHERRY Working on that and I'm just wanting, well, I'm getting a bunch of money from my, from parents who, who were killed years ago. And I'm moving on and out. 

00:29:00
DOMINICA So you don't wait too much. Okay, how and why are you living with them? 

00:29:05
ALISON Why? 

00:29:05
SHERRY Because my parents are dead. 

00:29:10
ALISON Why don't you live on your own? 

00:29:10
SHERRY I'm working on that. 

00:29:10
DOMINICA Because she's waiting for money for when she turns 21. 

00:29:15
ALISON Oh, I dint hear that. Yeah. 

00:29:15
JERRY I think, you need to let her speak herself. 

00:29:20
DOMINICA Well, Sherry said that. She dint hear. 

00:29:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Gary, what do you think about all this conversation going on here? 

00:29:25
GARY Well, I think, Alison's on the pity pot and uh… playing victim. 

00:29:30
ALISON Agree. 

00:29:30
GARY Umm… which is umm… it's where she's stuck. So, maybe she needs to go to AA. 

00:29:35
ALISON I don't have a drug problem. 

00:29:40
GARY Yeah, so you got a big problem. 

00:29:45
CRT Saying the unexpected to facilitate groupcohesion 

00:29:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, you know, one thing I noticed about this group which really is, is quite interesting is that you have a lot in common as I said three or four things. And yet some groups I have, they have very little in common, but you have a lot in common. Some groups, it takes a long time before anybody is willing to disagree, and here you are expressing some disagreement already. 

00:30:10
JERRY I mean, honestly this will help me with my marriage. 

00:30:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that's what… 

00:30:15
JERRY All these disagreement. 

00:30:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's what that, it's just a normal process of groups that they, the groups tend to disagree with each other. I mean, the members disagree. 

00:30:20
JERRY Soon after I leave here. I go tell my wife, this is all I did by sitting around and disagreeing. 

00:30:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, it let's where we are right now. So we're gonna try to see if we can help you. 

00:30:35
ALISON I don't see that this is gonna help. I'm just getting mad. 

00:30:40
CRT Normalizing feelings. 

00:30:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, that's perfectly normal reaction. Very healthy. 

00:30:45
JERRY How is that healthy? 

00:30:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I don't know how it is, it just is. 

00:30:50
JERRY Oh, okay. 

00:30:50
GARY Getting mad all the time is healthy? 

00:30:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Pardon me. 

00:30:50
GARY Getting mad all the time is healthy? 

00:30:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Not all the time, she said she's angry right now. 

00:30:55
GARY Well, she said she's mad all the time. 

00:30:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING No, she said that previously. Yes. 

00:31:00
GARY Yeah. 

00:31:00
ALISON I'm mad right now. 

00:31:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:00
ALISON I thought, I'd get a little support. 

00:31:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, let me ask you this Alison. Look around the room here at various people and see if there's anybody that you would like some support from? 

00:31:20
[sil.] 

00:31:25
ALISON I don't think I'm gonna get it from anybody. 

00:31:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING If you were to get it from somebody, who it is? 

00:31:30
ALISON Maybe Mala. 

00:31:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, and what would you like her to say to you? 

00:31:40
ALISON I don't know. 

00:31:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You know, what thought pops into your mind? 

00:31:45
ALISON Oh, I just yeah, I can see it's tough for you some… 

00:31:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, could you say that to her? 

00:31:50
MALA Oh, absolutely! 

00:31:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Why don't you look at her and say her… 

00:31:55
MALA No, I, I, I can, I can hear you what you say, your, your husband is in jail and have a little, little kid in your hand and uh… your in-laws are mean to you and you haven't done anything wrong. And I agree you, you're, I think, we are in the same boat. Maybe I don't know. It's too different, I, you know, I don't have the kid or anything right now. Our kids are grown up, but, but I understand it's just, it's mean and it's a feeling, right? Anger is a feeling. 

00:32:30
ALISON Thanks. 

00:32:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You have, you said thanks. Are you happy with what she said? 

00:32:35
ALISON Yeah. It sounds good. 

00:32:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Would you like some, a statement of support from Gary? 

00:32:40
ALISON I think, Gary isn't gonna do that. 

00:32:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING What if he did? 

00:32:45
ALISON I don't know why he would? 

00:32:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Why didn't he do? What if he did? 

00:32:50
ALISON Well, that would be different from what he said before. 

00:32:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:32:50
JERRY Yeah. 

00:32:55
CRT Establishing a boundary of respect. 

00:32:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Gary, could you, could you make a positive supportive statement for Alison? If you can't then rather you don't say anything. 

00:33:05
GARY Well, it reminds me kind of in a way of how stuck I was when I was in the, in the Maddness. So she, you seem pretty stuck. Umm… and that's… uh… 

00:33:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You're better off now? 

00:33:20
GARY It's very it's baring kind of feeling to be in the Maddness, that you're stuck. 

00:33:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So you can appreciate it. 

00:33:25
ALISON Yeah. 

00:33:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:33:25
ALISON How did you get on the stuck? 

00:33:30
GARY I just got sick of… 

00:33:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Are you listening? 

00:33:30
GARY Get tired of, I just got sick of it, living the way I was living, and I said, I got to do something. And other people are on my back and so finally I said, I have to do something umm… so that's when I went into, uh… went into treatment and then went to AAA and the rest is history. 

00:33:50
ALISON But how did, how do you know what to do? 

00:33:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Wait a minute, wait a minute. Before we talk about that, I wanna just ask you, what did you think about what he said to you? 

00:34:00
ALISON Who's, who's, who's better? 

00:34:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Better, better, okay. Did you all hear that over here? What do you, what so you hear about this little interchange among these three people? 

00:34:05
DOMINICA That Mala could really, because she is in a somewhat similar situations. 

00:34:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:34:15
DOMINICA Gary, he said something better than, he said… 

00:34:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right, oh, he said something better. 

00:34:20
DOMINICA Yeah. 

00:34:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Sherry, what you hear? 

00:34:20
SHERRY A little bit of compassion going on. 

00:34:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. So which is better for you when you connect with other people to be supportive or to be a little aggressive? Which is better for you? 

00:34:40
DOMINICA For me, personally, I', calling out to see you. 

00:34:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING But what, I mean, is, is yeah, okay, 

00:34:45
DOMINICA And I'd, rather somebody tell me the same. You know… 

00:34:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right. 

00:34:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING But, but would you like to hear it in a supportive way or in aggressive way? 

00:34:55
DOMINICA How I really put it out there… 

00:34:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right! So, it doesn't bother you. Okay. 

00:34:55
JERRY I want it in a more supportive way. 

00:35:00
DOMINICA Can I just give what you want? 

00:35:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sherry. How would you like to hear? 

00:35:05
SHERRY Supportive way is better but I'm, I'm not gonna care. I don't know these people. 

00:35:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING No, but I mean just in general. 

00:35:10
SHERRY Supportive is better. 

00:35:15
Chapter 5 Comments, Observations, & Questions 

00:35:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Supportive is better. Okay. Okay. All right, let's just come right here and have some discussion from our observers and what are your thoughts? Okay. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Well, what I was curious about, they have been new, new to these. Umm… I notice the criticism early in, in this part of the group. And is that normal in group work or Dominica came at somebody or uh… Gary came at somebody and of course I was curious about what Gary had in Maddness… He does a great job at (inaudible ) , really good. 

00:35:50
CRT Trust the Process. 

00:35:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, I, I think yes, it is, it is quite normal and uh… the conflict happens, there's always conflict in a group and I think you can expect it but my suggestion is the little slogan, "Trust the process." If you continue to use reality therapy in the group, these things are going to emerge, and then they're going to be resolved, and they may not be resolved perfectly. But, you know, there will be conflict. There will be disagreement. And it can happen quite early. Especially, if they feel some inclusion in the group, I'll come back to the idea of inclusion in a moment. Okay. 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN What was your strategy when you said you had a, a key question, and then you said, "Oh, I don't know you're ready for this." 

00:36:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that was just a little uh… effort to try to prepare them for uh… you know, that make to try to elicit some curiosity. And uh… I don't know if the timing was good, right for that, but I'm trying to illustrate things you can do in groups and uh… whether that was, the timing was perfect for this group or not. I don't know, but I was just on the spur of the moment trying to create a little bit of interest in the question. Yeah, did you notice the idea of inclusion in the group? And you remember how that occurred, at least my effort to do that. I'm not saying they are all saying, oh, yeah, I feel included in the group now. No, no, no, I don't think that. They didn't feel include, included in the group at first. But, I was trying to point out some things that they have in common. Okay, any other questions? Please come to the microphone. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN I just have an observation. I thought it was really interesting how you found commonalities when they didn't really seem to be a lot in them. 

00:37:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, and people who are coerced into a group or let's say encouraged in the group, they have that in common. And then, then they had in common three or four things such as ah… that somebody else should change and they really didn't wanna be here. They weren't too excited about it. So, I mean, you're scraping. You're really scraping for something in common uh… that's for sure. So they, they don't feel warm and fuzzy about this. Now many groups that I see, many training tapes are done with people that don't have this kind of issue, these kinds of issues to deal with, and they are there voluntarily. And I wanna present some ideas that you can use with groups that are not so excited to be there, the kind of groups that many of you deal with in schools, in agencies, in childcare programs, in probation, in, in private practice even where people are sort of pushed into being in a group. I think that's per, perhaps more common than people who are excited about being here. And even when people are excited about being there, there is some reluctance to disclose, and there is some hesitancy to say everything that's on their minds, and then there's conflict that arises, almost invariably. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN I really appreciated the fact that when those storming began, you actually sat back in your seat, allowed it to happen. Which, I think, sometimes, we're afraid of that confrontation so it was really great to see that happen. 

00:39:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yes. Yeah. Good, thank you. I, I think it's important to allow it to happen. You don't have to encourage it. You don't have to feel greatly satisfied when it does happen, but it, it will happen. But there's also the idea of doing something to prevent people from being hurt. And that's why when Gary said to Alison, you're on your pity pot, and I didn't think that was gonna be too helpful if we allow that kind of negativism to, to spread. And so I, I said to her, look around the room, is there anybody that you think could be supportive to you. And she found Mala, and Mala said something that was supportive. And then it was a little risky on my part to say. Ask Gary to do that but, but he was willing to do it. So sometimes, you do take a little risk. Okay. John. 

00:39:55
John Brickell 

00:39:55
Director 

00:39:55
Centre for Reality Therapy 

00:39:55
United Kingdom 

00:39:55
JOHN BRICKELL Yeah, my observation about was that before the break, how you started to work on that so it moved from the inclusion to getting support and asking, look around the group, is there anybody you would like to get support from. So I, I, you know, see that was a really good progression in group. And that even some of them weren't really that ready for it. But you're encouraging and it's, its support environment. So he seemed to work well what was beginning to. 

00:40:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You can see some progress. There's beginning some include, some linking among the group members. I'm trying to encourage them to talk to each other. And you'll notice in the beginning, it's almost one-to-one counseling in a group. I'm felt. I'm playing a very direct role, a very prominent role. And as it develops, you could kind of back away from it a little bit as I try to illustrate when there was this conflict, and they started to talk to each other. And as I say, it's very important to, to protect people from attack. And some groups, they allow that but the reality therapy group, I don't think should allow that kind of thing that happens. So, so if it happens and it will happen, you can kind of counterbalance that if, if you try to connect people with each other. Do you all want to say anything? 

00:41:10
GARY Well, I think, you were working with a highly resistant group. Umm… and, but the way that you handled it was you didn't fight the resistance, you just sort of went with it and agreed with their, you know, our resistance and, and then moved to, to build cohesion and you were trying to build cohesion uh… by including people and connecting so, I think that that was good. 

00:41:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, yeah, I think that there might have been a little cohesion initially. I mean, a little cohesion of beginning when they start talking to each other and over here with the supportive statements. Perhaps, they started to see that they could benefit from, from the comments of somebody else in the group, I mean, isn't its very early stages. And the inclusion was, am I struggling to try to find something in common that they have and, but, but that's, that's the idea. I think, the goal of this first session is to get them feeling good about the group to some extent, and that they are willing to return. We were kind of assuming that they had agreed to an X number of sessions, and so, so that, that was part of the contract. But we didn't talk about that, and the reason is as I said, I was assuming that they, they've had gone through the preliminary information about informed consent and agreement and all that so, so that's where we were with that. Okay, any other thoughts or comments? 

00:42:35
GARY I've, I've no one. This one is the power of the group comes from universality that everybody has is common needs and common feeling. And you were trying to move in that direction of universality so which it moves it towards hopefully cohesion and then… 

00:42:45
Chapter 6 The Next Session Begins 

00:42:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. Well, they all have needs. They all have needs for power and, and inner control which are not being fulfilled. Because, these other people are sort of coercing them and hassling them in some way or another in their own mind that's what, that's what seems to me to be going through their minds that they're being put upon by other people. And they don't all see the need to change now what Alison saw someone with something up a need to changing and so did Gary and even Mala to some extent. So, so they're all on this side of the room. But the next time we're gonna mix bump, you know, really very, very happy. I would sit somewhere else and at least that would, would, then get the ball rolling perhaps. So, so these, these are things to consider when you're doing a reality therapy group. And as you do the reality therapy group, you can certainly incorporate methods, and tools, and techniques from other theories, and, and other systems. I try to integrate the reality therapy into the stages of group as best I can. And as you can see the stages of group are not, are not nice neat categories. I mean, they overlap, you go forward, you go backward, there is elements of this, elements of that in each stage of groups. So uh… it's a hodgepodge to some extent, but that's the way human nature is. You know, we don't go uh… progress in our lives on a linear fashion. Sometimes, we go two steps forward, one step backward, one step sideways, and so on. The only thing that progresses steadily is age. And we did make progress in the clinic because the flies go on. Last week, we were able to deal with that. So let's say it's now the following week. And, and they come back and we'll just make this an abbreviated session. Okay? And we'll just, we'll just stop at a certain place, and then discuss it for a few more minutes. Okay, well, here we are back at the Center here. And I'm just wondering what's happened in the last week. Anybody, do you want to say something that, that you did that you could feel successful about, say in the last seven days? 

00:45:05
MALA I don't. 

00:45:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You don't. 

00:45:05
MALA I mean, I didn't, so, as I said last week, I have done everything in my power and there's nothing I can do well. 

00:45:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You're sure. Nothing? Okay, well, that's one thing we might be able to come up with in this group is something you can do. 

00:45:25
MALA I, I'd like to hear that. 

00:45:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:45:30
MALA I'm open. 

00:45:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right. 

00:45:30
ALISON I thought about what Gary said that, that he figured out something to do and way, it just it seems so dramatic. You know, if you're using drugs, you just stop using drugs that, that seems so clear and easy I wish, I wish something that clear could come to me. 

00:45:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, it sounds like you really want a solution. 

00:45:55
ALISON Oh yeah. I don't want it, I don't want it to be drugs. I don't wanna use medicine. 

00:46:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Sure. 

00:46:05
ALISON Because I don't like though it makes me feel. I tried it, it just feels awful, feels weird, you know. 

00:46:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. Medication, you mean? 

00:46:10
ALISON Yeah, it feels weird. 

00:46:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, let, let me say this, I encourage you to discuss that with your physician. 

00:46:15
ALISON Well, he's not a psychiatrist. He's just, you know, like I, you know, I don't think that worked. He's just like GYN. You know, I don't… 

00:46:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that would be something to, to work out there. But we can talk about some things you can do to feel better. 

00:46:35
GARY I had to take medication. 

00:46:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:46:35
GARY I take Lexapro, and velbutrin, and, of course, it's not very really looked upon favorably in AAA but, but I know that it got me out of my depression which is part of the reason I was drinking and drugging. I think, it drinking and drugging, maybe depressed. And I was depressed, because I was drinking and drugging, but uh… the medication seems to, seems to help a little bit. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Wow. 

00:47:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, again that's between you and your physician to work out. 

00:47:05
GARY Yeah, let's just get a feedback. 

00:47:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure, it's a good comment. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN I wish my husband would take care. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN We can take them forever? 

00:47:10
GARY Hope not. 

00:47:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Anybody over here do anything in the last week that you feels successful about? 

00:47:20
SHERRY I get job. 

00:47:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You did. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Wow! Congratulations. 

00:47:20
SHERRY Thank you. 

00:47:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Congratulations, right. What do you think about that? 

00:47:25
JERRY That's great! 

00:47:25
ALISON It's great, good for you. 

00:47:30
SHERRY Yes, I'm still with my aunt and uncle. 

00:47:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay. 

00:47:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Dominica, how about you? What did you do in the last week? 

00:47:40
DOMINICA I met with my mother. I went to my probation meeting. And I'm here, very much. 

00:47:45
SHERRY What, what it meant probation board? If you don't mind, say. 

00:47:50
DOMINICA I don't want. 

00:47:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Jerry, what about you? 

00:47:55
JERRY Watching TV, my wife comes, I'm still nagging. She said that I don't talk to her and all. 

00:48:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! 

00:48:05
JERRY But, we used to sit down and watch NASCAR together. She is the one who watch NASCAR. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN That sounds boring. 

00:48:10
MALA Can I say something? 

00:48:10
MALA Can I say something? 

00:48:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure. You can say anything you want. 

00:48:15
MALA You know, umm… I listen to you last week and umm… you bring more anger. 

00:48:25
JERRY I'm here being very quite. 

00:48:25
MALA Right! 

00:48:30
JERRY It's my nature to be quite. 

00:48:35
CRT Smoldering conflict! 

00:48:35
MALA That's, you pissed me off. Because, it reminds me off my husband, it's like, he needs to be on medication like Gary and he's doing, it would do a lot better and make my life a lot better. And you're just, just right there, just sit there and piss everybody off and you just are into your own world. And that's what my husband does to me. It's uh… and, and I'm losing my life, because he just goes on his merry way. And you're the same way and you don't even, you don't get it. 

00:49:05
JERRY In what way? In what way? 

00:49:05
ALISON Well, you've been a kind of hard on him. 

00:49:10
JERRY In what way am I pissing you off? 

00:49:10
MALA Well, because my, my husband umm… doesn't do what he needs to do for our marriage. 

00:49:15
JERRY You're telling like my wife. I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this. I'm tired of I have to do. 

00:49:25
MALA Then go be miserable and you just… 

00:49:25
JERRY I'm here very quiet. I'm not angering anybody. I'm very quiet, and this thing, I'm here because… 

00:49:35
MALA Yeah, that's exactly what my husband does. so quiet and. 

00:49:40
JERRY That's fine. 

00:49:40
MALA Right 

00:49:45
CRT What do you want from the group? 

00:49:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Now, I wanna ask to group something. Uh… you know, it's your group, and you've agreed to come here 10 times. How do you wanna spend your time? You want to spend your time arguing with each other, criticizing each other? Now I, I have this little uh… ABC method, it's called Arguing, Blaming, Criticizing, Demeaning, those are what's called toxic behaviors, they create a poisonous atmosphere among people. Do you wanna spend your time taking poison? Or do you wanna time, you're spend your time working on some tonic behaviors which is figuring out what to do? 

00:50:25
ALISON Well, I, I've thought a little bad, something little bad for, for Jerry and Mala, it's really criticizing. Now I understand, I understand how you feel like it's the same for you, but you know, he's here at least. He's, he's, he's doing something even though he's only here, because his wife said he had to do something. At least he is here. You know, it is more than your husband's doing. You know, so maybe, maybe it's a little step… 

00:50:55
MALA Now, you're on his side? 

00:51:00
ALISON No, I'm just, I'm just saying maybe, maybe it was kind of hard on him to get yelled at. I don't know. You were so sweet to me. 

00:51:10
MALA Well, I really appreciated it and it's your situation is understandable just clueless. 

00:51:15
(crosstalk) 

00:51:20
Chapter 7 Aiming at a Plan of Action 

00:51:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING This is my point. This is my point. You, you've really illustrated the point. Do you want to spend your time attacking each other, criticizing each other? Or you wanna work out something for your own lives that's better than what you've been doing? We talked about that last week. I thought you did from what we said last week but maybe we need to check that out again. Do you wanna work on something? Or do you wanna criticize? 

00:51:40
ALISON Yeah, I mean, show me, what am I supposed to work on? 

00:51:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's, that's what we're gonna be to working on, do you want, I'm just asking now, do you want to work on? Not how to do it, but yet, but do you want solve your problems that you have? 

00:51:55
ALISON Yeah, I wanna know what I can do. 

00:51:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right, you wanna… 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Yeah! I do. 

00:52:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right! 

00:52:00
JERRY I'm just being quiet. I feel pissed off, almost she said… 

00:52:05
CRT The group members stand at a fork in the road. 

00:52:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, I can see that. All right, another question that I have, another question that I have is, you, you've, you've had a little conflict, you've had some, you know, attacking behaviors here in this group. I asked you, if you wanna continue that. I see some people, almost indicating you don't sort of. Okay. Umm… my, my next question is, everybody in this room has some feeling about what's happening in your life whether it's even in this group or whether it's outside the group. Do you want to continue to nurse the bad feelings? Or do you want to let them go? You have a choice as you sit here today to let go of some debilitating, hurtful feelings. Or you could nurse them along the rest of your lives and be miserable. It you're, it is your choice. 

00:53:00
ALISON I don't, I don't see how we can just get rid of feeling. 

00:53:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You can't get rid of them easily. I didn't say easily. I just said do you want. 

00:53:05
ALISON But made it sounds simple. I don't think it's simple. 

00:53:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And I do, yes, because I'm a simple counselor. And, and the simplicity is do you want to do something about it? 

00:53:15
GARY I'll do. Yeah. 

00:53:20
ALISON That is warning making us… 

00:53:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You want to nurse feelings or do you want to feel better? That's the is… 

00:53:25
GARY 12-step recovery, we talked about stinking thinking. 

00:53:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! 

00:53:30
GARY And so, uh… what got me into trouble was doing us thinking about things and, and I always thought with everybody else, I was in the madness, blamed everybody else. Umm… and, and it seems like, I was in my drugs and alcohol, but people here are in drugs and alcohol, but they're still blaming everybody else. 

00:53:45
MALA So what do you mean? 

00:53:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, that's my question. Do you want to do that blame other people? Do you wanna nurse feelings? Or do you wanna take responsibility? I mean, this is a hard question I'm keep, I keep asking it, because it is a crucial, crucial… 

00:53:55
DOMINICA It is hard, because you wanna do all of it. You know, you want to be in control of yourself. You don't want to be angry at everybody else. 

00:54:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right. You, you, are you saying you, I or you? 

00:54:10
DOMINICA Everybody, because I'm listening to everybody, but in that same way. You know, that's something that you have control over being angry and blaming other people. 

00:54:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure, sure. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. She said something very important here. Dominica, you said, you, have control over that. 

00:54:25
DOMINICA Yes, you know, that's probably, for me, right now, that's the only thing I am only control off. I'm, I'm angry and upset at my Mother, so I can do things to myself that, you know, I know that are harmful and I shouldn't do. But that's what I can do. So that's what I do. 

00:54:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! Yeah, and did you wanna an alternative to that? 

00:54:45
DOMINICA Yeah. I do. 

00:54:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right. That's our statement of high motivation right there. Did you, did you everybody hear that? 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, she talked little quicker. 

00:54:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I want. Well, that's what this is too, that's what we do this group as we talk. Yeah. So, so uh… she said, she wants to really do something about the feeling she has. Does anybody else want to do something about the feeling you have? Like, let it go, some of the, some of the feelings that are holding you back. 

00:55:10
MALA Yeah, I really wanna let go. 

00:55:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right! 

00:55:10
MALA Yeah. 

00:55:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You wanna let go. And Alison? 

00:55:15
ALISON Yeah. 

00:55:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right, Gary? 

00:55:20
GARY Well, I don't know what I'm letting go, but I wanna look forward. 

00:55:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, you wanna look forward. Sure. Everybody's in a different way, the question doesn't, the question isn't completely applicable to each person in the same way. You wanna let go? 

00:55:30
JERRY I don't know. I'm like Gary, I want to let go. 

00:55:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Anything that's holding you back? 

00:55:35
JERRY What's holding me back? I'm, I'm home, I, I take care of the house, so I got this nagging wife. I want, my marriage don't work. 

00:55:45
DOMINICA I think you should let go of the nagging wife. 

00:55:50
JERRY Let her go. 

00:55:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING She said, let go of the nagging wife. Well, until you do that. 

00:55:50
JERRY We've just been back together. 

00:55:50
MALA Why don't you let go of just doing nothing. 

00:55:55
JERRY I'm, I'm home. I take care of the house. I'm disabled. Okay, I can't work. 

00:56:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Would you like your life to be better? That's the point? 

00:56:05
JERRY I think it is better. 

00:56:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Better than what? I thought you were here. because it wasn't going where you wanna do it. 

00:56:10
JERRY I'm not confused. 

00:56:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING No, no, Jerry 

00:56:15
DOMINICA Were you surviving without your wife… 

00:56:15
JERRY Yes. But I missed her. 

00:56:15
DOMINICA I think probably would be, you're solution is just not to be bothered with her. I mean, if you can survive for the year. 

00:56:25
JERRY You mean another girl? 

00:56:25
DOMINICA Yeah, instead of coming in and, you know, you're okay, and you are all slept down and you, I'm not bothering by what I'm doing things like… 

00:56:30
JERRY My back hurts. 

00:56:30
DOMINICA You know, you're just existing, you're not living. What a waste. 

00:56:35
JERRY I dint come here for this. 

00:56:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I, I wanna ask you again? 

00:56:45
CRT Counselor refuses to give up and shows persistance…relentless persistance! 

00:56:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I wanna ask the group again the same question. Do you wanna spend our time criticizing each other? Or do you wanna spend your time helping each other? 

00:56:50
ALISON I thought that was a helpful comment that Dominica made to Jerry. 

00:56:55
MALA Yeah. 

00:56:55
ALISON Yeah, she gave him some advice. 

00:57:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Did you think it was a helpful comment? 

00:57:00
JERRY No, sir. 

00:57:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, do you wanna spend your time making helpful comments, solving problems, or at least addressing problems? Or do you wanna spend your time criticizing each other? 

00:57:10
GARY I got a question for Jerry. 

00:57:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Arguing, blaming, criticizing. 

00:57:15
SHERRY Oh, it's entertaining for me. 

00:57:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well, I kind of get a kick out of it myself, but I don't know that it's that helpful. 

00:57:20
DOMINICA I don't think it's helpful. 

00:57:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING That's my questions. Is it helpful? 

00:57:25
SHERRY Not for Jerry, he doesn't look like he's being helped. No. 

00:57:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

00:57:25
GARY I got a question to Jerry. 

00:57:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Is this a reasonable question? 

00:57:30
GARY I guess, you're the judge. 

00:57:35
ALISON I think it's pretty reasonable. 

00:57:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING No, you're the judge. 

00:57:35
GARY No, it's very reasonable. 

00:57:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

00:57:35
GARY So Jerry, let me ask you, what do you do all day? I mean, how do you structure your time? 

00:57:40
JERRY I like watching NASCAR and I watch NASCAR most of the day and I take it with my truck. I got a new Dodge Ram. 

00:57:50
GARY Ah…what kind of income? I mean, how do you, how do you pay? 

00:57:55
JERRY I'm waiting for back Social Security. I think, I'm gonna get a nice loved son. 

00:58:00
GARY Okay, your wife work? 

00:58:00
JERRY Yeah. 

00:58:00
GARY So, she's supporting family. 

00:58:05
JERRY Yeah. 

00:58:05
GARY You like that? 

00:58:10
JERRY I'm, I'm disabled. I can't work. At certain, I was a painter and I slept up the, the ladder and I hurt my back and I'm getting disability. I'm getting the back disability, but I'm kind of getting disability. 

00:58:20
ALISON Wow! 

00:58:20
JERRY What's that? 

00:58:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right! 

00:58:25
ALISON That wasn't nice. 

00:58:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Let me ask you this. What went through your mind when Gary was, was talking to you? 

00:58:35
JERRY It was nice to have another male companion out. 

00:58:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so it was, it was, it was good for you to hear, to hear somebody reaching out to you, right? 

00:58:40
JERRY Yes. 

00:58:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so that's, that I wanna ask you this. Do you want this group to be a reaching out group? Or do you want it to be a highly competitive argumentative group? 

00:58:50
JERRY I want to be just like… 

00:58:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING This is our second time meeting. And we're way down the road, because you're already doing these things. And I'm asking you to evaluate them. 

00:59:00
JERRY I want, what he gave me. 

00:59:05
DOMINICA What? 

00:59:05
JERRY Which is… 

00:59:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Can you say something supportive to him? Lean forward and look at him. 

00:59:10
MALA Well, umm… supportive? 

00:59:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah, I'm asking you to do something hard. 

00:59:20
MALA Like, yeah, you know, you know, how could I let you off. 

00:59:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Supportive, supportive, supportive. 

00:59:30
ALISON I don't think she's gonna be able to say anything supportive, because she's seeing her husband in him. 

00:59:30
MALA I'm so angry… 

00:59:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, supportive, supportive, supportive. 

00:59:35
MALA And that's probably why, why her husband is depressed. 

00:59:40
DOMINICA She may just hurt. 

00:59:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Supportive. 

00:59:40
DOMINICA I don't think that she's gonna be too much help to Jerry. 

00:59:40
MALA Now, he's gone. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN You're brutal Dominica, you're brutal. 

00:59:45
DOMINICA I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, you know, life is hard. It's just, this is real. 

00:59:50
MALA Yeah, yeah. You've created your own lousy life. 

00:59:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right, all right. Can you say anything? 

00:59:55
ALISON Can I say, can I say something? 

00:59:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, you, you're obviously not ready to say that. 

01:00:00
ALISON I, I think that umm… I think, Jerry that, you know, Mala was kind of taking out her feelings about her husband on you. And, but I don't think she dislikes she was much as it feels like to you right now. I think it's kind of just how she's feeling about her situation. 

01:00:20
JERRY Okay! 

01:00:20
ALISON Right! 

01:00:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, I think, you even said earlier, he reminds you about your husband. 

01:00:25
MALA Oh yeah, totally. 

01:00:25
ALISON So, I don't think that it your fault that she… 

01:00:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Maybe it. Are you saying, can I just rephrase what you said that it wasn't really directed toward him. It's more stored up energy against her husband. 

01:00:40
ALISON Yeah, but he's, he gotten away and he kind of got hurt. 

01:00:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah! Yeah! 

01:00:45
MALA Now he's pack, now, he's so passive. 

01:00:50
CRT The counselor is evidently a former high school teacher 

01:00:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Can you tell me? Can you take it? I think, I think, you made your point. Uh… can you, can you take it, can you take it that way? 

01:00:55
JERRY Yes, I can take it. I can take it. 

01:00:55
Chapter 8 Still Aiming at a Plan of Action 

01:00:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Now, my question remains. Umm… do you want the group to be helpful to each other? Do you want the individual members to be helpful? Or do you want to be argumentative? Because if you want to be argumentative, you don't need this group, you don't need counseling, you don't need this, this help. We'll just be glad to, you know, meet for 10 sessions, and then, you know, just sit and arguing. 

01:01:20
MALA So my, my question is to be helpful to each other. I can give each of them good advice and I think it make sense. 

01:01:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Good advice is one thing, a hurtful attacks. 

01:01:30
MALA Well, that is what you can do for me. 

01:01:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Good advice is one thing, hurtful attacks is another? 

01:01:35
MALA Okay, I can do it. 

01:01:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I'm, I'm asking the group, I'm asking everybody, and the group, is this really the kind of group you want? 

01:01:45
JERRY I'll try. 

01:01:45
GARY Well, I'd like it to be more like AAA is where people really listen and they don't attack, uh… don't criticize and you may not agree with what the person is saying, but at least people get to say their say. 

01:02:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:02:00
GARY So I don't think that I would like to see. 

01:02:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, yeah. 

01:02:05
DOMINICA Well, how about you each throw out a general rule that we like everybody else, so bye-bye. 

01:02:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I would be (inaudible ). 

01:02:15
ALISON What would that be, what? 

01:02:15
DOMINICA It's your own thing, whatever it is that you don't want to take place here. You put that out there. And we all agree to, to go with that. 

01:02:25
GARY Umm… 

01:02:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I dint get that, what was that again? 

01:02:25
MALA I don't get it. 

01:02:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING What is it you don't want to have happen here and what is it you do want to have happen? Will that be… 

01:02:35
DOMINICA Yeah, okay. Well, people say that I'm a little harsh, a little hard, but I call it like I see it. I'm willing to tone that down a little bit. I'm willing to really think and try to rephrase it so that it doesn't come out the way, you know, that it's coming out. There it's a little softer so that you feel supported as opposed to attack. I'm willing to do that. 

01:02:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Wow! Cool! 

01:02:55
ALISON Wow! 

01:02:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Anybody else willing to do that? 

01:03:00
ALISON I, I appreciate you're saying that, Dominica. 

01:03:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Do you want to be willing to try to do same thing? 

01:03:05
ALISON Well, yeah, I might feel a little safer. 

01:03:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING All right, Gary? 

01:03:05
GARY Sure. 

01:03:10
MALA Sure, I'm, I'm always willing to what have. 

01:03:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, Sherry, how about you? 

01:03:15
CRT The group reaches concensus on 

01:03:15
SHERRY Yes, I'm moving. 

01:03:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, Jerry? 

01:03:15
JERRY Cool. 

01:03:20
Chapter 9 Plan:Practice Transferrable Communication Skills 

01:03:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So we got a kind of a, a guideline for communicating in this group. Now, and, and you all agree to that? Okay, now I wanna ask you this. What do you think about using that guideline outside of this group as you talk to other people? 

01:03:40
MALA I don't have any problem with anybody. 

01:03:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. Okay. 

01:03:45
JERRY How can I use it with my wife? 

01:03:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, that's, I'm just asking you if, if you think you could without getting into how to just yet. Do you think you would be interested in learning that? 

01:03:55
JERRY Yes 

01:03:55
MALA Yeah. 

01:03:55
GARY Sounds good. 

01:03:55
ALISON I don't, I don't do anything. I don't criticize. 

01:04:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING No, I, I understand, but maybe learning something better to do, even better improving what you're already doing that maybe that's a better way to put it. Would you be interested in that Sherry? 

01:04:10
SHERRY Yes. 

01:04:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, because then in the group we can practice talking to each other in a way that you could actually transfer to other relationships. 

01:04:25
DOMINICA I find myself being very harsh with mother, because she won't do. 

01:04:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Sure, well. You want to best for her. 

01:04:30
DOMINICA Exactly! She won't. 

01:04:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING She won't take the treatment. Yeah, it's hard not to be harsh with somebody like that. But what we can do here is practice as you talk to each other, these skills that are transferable to the real world. 

01:04:45
ALISON You know, I'd, I'd like to practice not taking everything personally. I don't know that's gonna work in here. But I feel like, I get, I get so hurt by things that happen, and things other people say. And, you know, I get so angry and I, I like to, like to learn how to not do that. 

01:05:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING So you'd like to work on that. 

01:05:10
ALISON That doesn't seem like something can work on in here. 

01:05:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, you said, you'd like to do that maybe, maybe we could, we don't know that. 

01:05:15
ALISON Yeah, yeah. 

01:05:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And Dominica said she'd like to work on being, I think, you said with your mother some ways there to deal with her? 

01:05:25
ALISON What's so (inaudible ) not getting upset when Dominica's harsh. So if she quit being harsh, I don't know, it will work or not, you know. 

01:05:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, well. We can. These are all things that we got this is only our second week. We've got eight more weeks. Okay. Sherry, what, what do you think? 

01:05:40
SHERRY I think, it's fine. I don't, I get along fine with people. 

01:05:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I thought you had some difficulty at home when you're living with your aunt. 

01:05:50
SHERRY They want me to baby-sit all the time. Now I got a part-time job so that kind of gives me a, a lee way, but they kind of wanna tell me what to do when I'm old enough to do that myself. Dominica thinks, I should move out too. 

01:06:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, maybe we can figure some things out with the group that you've got all these people here. They may have an idea. 

01:06:10
SHERRY Sounds good. 

01:06:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Jerry, what about you? You wanna figure out a way to deal with your wife better. 

01:06:15
JERRY I would like to. I don't wanna separate again. 

01:06:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, and you want to figure out how to deal with all the turmoil in your life Mala? 

01:06:25
MALA One person, my husband. 

01:06:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, okay. It sounded like a crowd before. Yeah! 

01:06:30
MALA Well, I, I have no problem with everybody else and I, and I don't want my husband to leave, or I just want him to get help. So, I don't have any problem with anybody. 

01:06:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. All right Gary, you wanna deal with some things outside this group? 

01:06:45
GARY You know, my wife, she's gonna hand in with our marriage. I'm not sure why, so I'm gonna be, you know… 

01:06:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, so maybe what happens in this group would be like a rehearsal in a sense, I don't, maybe, an explicit rehearsal as far as rehearsing how to deal with some of these people. 

01:07:00
MALA Okay! 

01:07:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING And also just how you communicate with each other. I mean, I'm just trying to reflect what I think you said. 

01:07:05
MALA Well, I really don't need to, to learn to have a better communication with somebody like Jerry. Like you know, I see him ad then so I can't be nice to him. 

01:07:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. You can't be nice to miss practice for outside. Is that (inaudible ). 

01:07:20
MALA I'm nice to everybody. 

01:07:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, okay. 

01:07:20
ALISON do you, are you nice to your husband? 

01:07:20
MALA Yeah, very much. Some people say I'm too nice. 

01:07:25
ALISON Is that what you think? 

01:07:30
MALA Umm…yeah, I really do. 

01:07:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, I think we have a sense of direction for our group. Practice with each other, how to talk to each other with the idea that maybe there's a lesson in here about how to talk to other people. What do you think? 

01:07:50
SHERRY It sounds like a plan. 

01:07:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, now that ends our group for today, but the next time I'd like to ask you about what are some things you do in your life that are really fun. And I don't mean getting in trouble, and I don't mean taking drugs or anything of the kind. I mean fun that was that is within the bounds of society, you know, like, going on picnics or talking you while watching, doing something that's effort, effortful uh… something that takes effort and energy. I'd like to ask you about that and ask you to think about it between now, next week would you be willing to do that? 

01:08:25
ALISON Sure. 

01:08:25
GARY Yeah. No problem. 

01:08:25
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. Alison, you could think about that? 

01:08:25
ALISON Yeah. 

01:08:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well, don't overdo it, just, just think a little. Is that okay? Okay, all right, good, well. We'll see you next time. 

01:08:35
MALA Okay. 

01:08:35
Chapter 10 Comments, Observations, & Questions about the 2nd Session 

01:08:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, all right. 

01:08:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, let's have a brief discussion about this, the, I, I feel like a deadest here. 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN And I feel like, dead at the deadest. 

01:08:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, yeah. We're gonna get that wisdom too, but that's the last thing we need. Well, that's the way it is sometimes, and you can see that I'm kind of, I'm getting bored as a counselor getting more into it and getting more, sometimes I'm actually impatient. And I think that's very human thing to do. And sometimes that that helps the group actually unless you really get angry or something which said that I would not be useful, but when you kind of want this group to get going and they finally did because I, they, they were showing some negative energy. And I'm trying to balance that with some positive energy. And umm… so anyway that's my thought as I, as I reflect back. Okay, let's hear a couple of comments please. 

01:09:35
JOHN BURKELY (ph) (inaudible ). 

01:09:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING John Burkely is an instructor from Great Britain. And he comes to United States and teaches as well as teaches many workshops, and training programs uh… in England, and Scotland, and Wales. 

01:09:50
JOHN BURKELY (ph) Well, exhibitors of what you're doing here in America with this group, umm… you mentioned at the beginning of the session your introduction, so that there's lots of different ways of running groups. And it was very evident here that when umm… it started to drift perhaps into arguing, they're umm… criticizing each other that you orchestrated that, you intervened to, to get them to start cooperating and just not allow that stress to give them and evaluation question. Is this what you want the group to be like? Would you wanna do to be more productive than that? So umm… I'm just wanna comment that about not allowing the group's truth, but to orchestrate it and lead it in that way. 

01:10:35
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, this is not a, a kind of a group where you would allow, allow. It'll just flounder. I think, you need to take some charge of it, not in any heavy handed way, but in a directive way. And that is to steer it toward something positive. And I, I again, I'm, I'm hurrying, because of the rope line. I said we can do this much work in this amount of time. And so they, they resist, maybe even more than a real group would, because they're, they're not quite ready to, to make any changes. But I'm, I'm trying to illustrate some interventions that you can actually make in a group whether you make up this quickly in a group after an hour or you make them subsequently uh… that depends on the group. Yes. 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN And this group is really small, only six. But I bet your handful to facilitate this group. I'm giving recommendations on sizes of group. 

01:11:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Well! Uh… yeah, we, we make the group small, I think, so we can kind of keep everybody involved. But, size is a tricky thing because I've seen class meetings which are not counseling meetings but class meetings with over 50 people in. And then you're talking about an intellectual topic. And you're following the format define personalize and challenge, and then you can add on the WDEP to that define something what is friendship, personalize it, You have friends, challenge what if you had no friends, what if everyone were your friend, and then do you want more friends? What you're doing to get friends? Is it helping? And can you make a plan? That would be an example of a kind of an intellectual discussion about belonging and, and, and connectedness with other people. So you can have a group discussion with a very large group. I've been in groups ah…of, of X-offenders of up to 15 people, but it's pretty tough to manage. It's pretty tough to manage especially if there's a great deal of conflict. So I recommend uh… my personal recommendation is about 10 people maximum for, for this sort of group where they're really discussing their own personal agendas. But if you have two helpers, then it's even better, you know, to myself and somebody else that it makes it a lot better. If you have, you can go up, I would say 2 to 15, but again it depends on the comfort of the people, of the leaders, and their skill. 

01:13:05
UNKNOWN I guess, this is an observation, but one of the things that I noticed was that when they were in the group and they were arguing and things, and you asked them, "What were they willing to do differently in the group?" And, but I was impressed when you carried that further with "What were they willing to do? Would they do that outside of the group?" The communication, I thought that was really good. 

01:13:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, so, you know, you had, I figure you listen carefully, and trust the process, trust your own knowledge of reality therapy. And, and when they start doing that, it just dawned on me. Not only does the group that, let's talk civilly in the group, but let's use that as a rehearsal for the world outside. And that they seem to that's to buy into that at varying levels of commitment. I mean, they all weren't real excited about that but, but, you know, you do your best. And you try to, you try to lead the group and push them sometimes, but not push them beyond where they're willing to go. Sandie, you gotta coming? 

01:14:15
Sandie Wubbolding 

01:14:15
SANDIE WUBBOLDING It was basically on the relationships, every person up there has a relationship either with a spouse or with a family. And so what you're rehearsing is the behaviors to improve the relationships and make that, but you're stressing the point of where do you start. And you're starting here with yourself and if at least as I said in the group, and then practicing for the outside but the relationship it seems to be the focus and how to make it better which then also you need to help yourself feel better, and so by helping yourself learn some things that are doing that you will do differently, and then come back and see how that worked. And then if it did okay, we'll practice something again. And if not, where do we go from here. But it seems like you're focusing on strengthening the bonds by doing something positive and helpful. 

01:15:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, strengthening their bond so that they feel some connectedness, connectedness with each other. And then they learn some skills, and then the next time I'm gonna say, did you try any of this outside of the group, did you, did you communicate with anybody outside the group using these skills. Another thing to look for is umm… somebody when somebody that says something positive, and for a while there I thought man this group is totally chaotic. It probably appeared that way as you were watching it because they were really going at it. You know, sometimes just the best of times you, you think you're making progress. You, you think you're backtracking. Well, you're really not backtracking because they're bringing out what was submerged in the first place, and so then they started. They started at each other. I don't know. No and so but, but just, just relax and, and realize that somebody's gonna say something positive in a very few minutes. And somebody did I don't remember the detail but, but what they did then and then you can build on it. So but, but sometimes, you have to intervene as I did rather emphatically and said is this what we want this group to be, and what's helpful, what's hurtful, what's productive, what's destructive, what's going to get you where you wanna go, what's going to impede your progress, all those are so evaluation questions that you can ask a group about their current immediate behavior and is that how you communicate outside of this group with people, how's that working for you. And so you, you again helping them self evaluate and like I say we're in the very early stages of counseling. I mean, there was some, there was some conflict that's true and uh… it's somewhat, it, it, it became rather incandescent at moments. But it, it merely was just a sort of flickering most of the time. So you wanna bright try to prevent that incandescent from becoming a firestorm. And that was my, my goal there because otherwise you lose people. And when somebody says something really hostile to another person, I suggest asking them to rephrase it or asking somebody else to say something supportive. I'm not trying to, to make this just warm and fuzzy. I'm just try, I'm trying to make it productive. And it's Glasser that always says you don't help people by hurting them so, so these raw feelings can come out and, and anger and so on. And the idea is not, not to totally suppress it but at the same time encourage support, encourage cohesion, any other comments? 

01:17:45
DOMINICA I have had a few. 

01:17:45
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, okay. Dominica? 

01:17:50
DOMINICA In the beginning of the group is that, is that not a normal thing to set some parameters, some guidelines, something that, you know, people are not, you know, will like, maybe I'm here, but I'm saying I don't want anybody to ask me why I'm here, because when I'm ready to reveal that I'll do that and then maybe, you know, we're going I don't want anybody umm… using the F-word, because I'm just so, you know, that's what my husband does there would be where actually he used to call me all the time. And I'm not gonna be able to, you know, would you not sense. 

01:18:20
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You could. You could. Ah… I was just thinking of groups where they're gonna use whatever language they want to use regardless of the rule you said and umm… but, but if you, if you feel comfortable setting those rules in some circumstances, it would certainly be appropriate. You could, you know, make the rules a little bit more precise than we did. But I was as I said assuming that we had gone through something some of the preliminary is like no illegal drugs and, and no alcohol or anything like that present in the group. But you could make it a, even more exact and more precise than that if that's appropriate and as some of that depends on the agency. You know, I think, people are, are, I'm just concerned that people are gonna talk. If you make too many rules about how they, how they can communicate, then they, they might violate it. But, but you could when the people start grossing each other out, I think, you'd say this is helping. You can use that as material for counseling is there a better way to say that. You know, so, so you can use that even that kind of communication as a basis for self evaluation. But, but my answer is, is the short, the short answer is uh… what's appropriate and what you in the agency, or school, or whatever is feel comfortable with. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN We've talked about when educate people. And I just thought that the demonstration on using the, the ABCD was a really good way to show to, to talk about like how what choice theory is or reality therapy is, the educational part of it and it fell out a really good time. 

01:19:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, the timing for teaching is important. Uh… you, you can start with a group and explain the chart to them in the beginning. And this group would care a less and so I suggest that the timing is important. And that's why I said, I, I started to introduce the, the fun, didn't I? I said, would you think about what you're doing for fun? And so you're, I'm starting to introduce a little intellectual discussion of the needs. I already mentioned tonics and toxin, glass or (inaudible ) and seven caring heaven, seven destructive habits, and when I just, I just used the phrase tonic and toxin as ideas for a long time, but it's the same idea of, of communication and behaviors which are destructive or productive. So I, I, you know, I gradually introduced it. And it would take more time before you really went into it in detail. But we only had like a meeting and a half here, a meeting and a half. And I think, there was quite a bit of progress when you consider the short amount of time that we had and where they started from. They actually said, yes, I wanna do something to improve my life, not to me. That is an enormous step from the reason I'm here is because somebody forced me. That was the general concept. There was maybe Alison was the single exception to that. 

01:21:20
Chapter 11 Final Thoughts from the Group 

01:21:20
GARY One of the things that I was looking for as it's not a deal with more effectively with resistance. And we were a resistant group and I thought you did that very well and then you take that… 

01:21:30
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:21:35
MALA I'd say the same thing because although it will be very young, happy, and angry, and resistance and I, I like the way you handle with, with each and every one of us and try to have a different perception and make it into positive somehow. That was very good. I'm gonna take that with… 

01:22:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING There was a struggle, I'm tired. 

01:22:05
DOMINICA Umm… something that I know is that thought was excellent and said it's especially as counselors who some people clients get into thinking that I'm here for you to solve all my problems. And when you were asking, if we were willing to do just that one thing to go out and I know so Alison and Jerry caressing okay, but well, how am I gonna do this and rectify. We're not trying to, you know, to solve this. I'm just actually to do one thing. oh, let's focus on that one thing is, you know, I'm not gonna give you, you know, the kind of (inaudible ) that you're all, right now, that's not how is gonna happen. So I thought that was really good. 

01:22:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, good. And, and I think the resistance surfaced when I would say "Do you wanna do this?" And they immediately said, "Well, we don't know how." You, you hear that a lot. You're trying to, you're working on the level of commitment to try to get people to say they want to change, and then they, they say, "Well, no because I don't know how." But that's down there, that's out forever. We're just, we were just talking about do you want to make a change in your life. We'll talk about how avoid it. And they'll help each other with the how. Okay, so I, I just wanted to add that. 

01:23:10
MALA She. 

01:23:15
ALISON Oh I'm gonna say, it was really important from, to me to hear how you managed to give us to talk to each other instead of just one set of accusing each other of things that, you know, asking will and, you know, if there's, is there something supportive you can say and, and, of course, someone was directed me but then when I noticed between Jerry and Mala then ah… it was, I think, it was a, it, that's a good way of getting the group to interact each other. 

01:23:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I'd like the way how he, his technique of stopping Mala from attacking. 

01:23:50
[sil.] 

01:23:50
JERRY Yeah, I, I like that. 

01:23:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING She said something, and then she started again. I just said, I think, you've made your point here. 

01:24:00
[sil.] 

01:24:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING One, one, one hit with the rubber mouth and that's enough, that's enough. But that's what people do. You know, this is very realistic. And I think, we need to intervene without attacking them. Because you could, you know, you can respond in kind, and that's, that's a temptation I think. But the reality therapy gives us an alternative to responding to a hostile comment with another hostile comment. Now we have to model some kind of behavior that's better than that. And some people can kind of challenge us. They can, they can really challenge us some attack. I, you know, and not that they're challenging us personally, but that what they say is a, a sort of offensive to our values. And I think, we need to, to realize by doing the best they can. As Glasser says, everybody does the best they can at the time they do it. And if you recognize that, that's helpful another little slogan might be helpful that I like is that people don't have problems, they have solutions that have not worked. And many of the people in this room, their behavior is their solution to an out of balance scale to an attempt to satisfy their needs. It may not be the way you or I do it, but it's their attempt at that moment. So if you can look at it that way, it, it kind of helps us to lower our level of perception toward their behavior. 

01:25:25
DOMINICA And also another thing umm… when I know you mentioned that have this been in actual group, next time we would have seen in the settlement, because all know that, you know, the talking people were all on that side, you're okay, you're, but you still, you know, came around us, involve us. And, you know, so we're not feeling like, 'cause I'm thinking, I'm in group. I'm not saying anything. He's not saying anything to me. I'm here for treatment too here. That's probably one of the reasons, you know, it would kind of be reluctant to go to group. Because I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna sit back and kind of serve, but by being when you turn around and out you know, are you gonna say something? How you feel about that having this like, so you pull everybody minutes and that was. 

01:26:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING You know, you try to do that but, you know, you, you might make a mistake. And me, I, if I, if I look at this video, I'll probably say I could have done this better, could have done that better, that's, that's a good way to approach it. You can do things better than what you saw here. You will do things that are different and, and more effective. So I encourage you to, to look at this and look at the tape in this way. And, but, you, I did, I did try to involve people over here because the tendency is to give your attention to the more verbal people. 

01:26:35
GARY I think, the questions, asking the questions, and as I was sets saying here also sets boundaries. 

01:26:40
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:26:45
GARY Umm… in other words, asking the questions is, is creating a direction, or creating boundaries within which and you're binding people to, to be within those boundaries that they don't wanna be there or not. 

01:26:55
ALISON Yeah. 

01:26:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:26:55
GARY So it was a, you know, people had to make a decision. 

01:27:00
ALISON It cares a way of being directive without being obvious and about it. 

01:27:05
GARY Of course, not… 

01:27:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:27:05
ALISON Of course, it yeah. because it, it gives some choice. Yeah. 

01:27:10
GARY Choice theory. 

01:27:10
ROBERT WUBBOLDING I heard of that. 

01:27:10
ALISON Do you have a question? 

01:27:10
MALA What I notice is umm… and I was waiting that you would hear me, what are you here exactly? What are exactly you are hear? What's your story? And you didn't go there. I don't. So you were just focusing on, you are here because of we're not happy, and somebody send you here and careful fixing on that and if you're willing to walk in the next thing you came up with which it was surprising to me is ah… next time talk about, think about do something fun. 

01:27:50
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Oh, man. 

01:27:50
MALA So it just completely takes it away. So that was really good. 

01:27:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay. 

01:27:55
MALA Thank you. 

01:27:55
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Thank you. Thank you all. 

01:27:55
GARY A question before you. 

01:28:00
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, please. 

01:28:00
GARY Okay, in group there's umm… people want to tell their stories. 

01:28:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah. 

01:28:05
GARY Okay, you know, drunk a lot or that, self-pity or whatever umm… so briefly, how far you've let people go and telling the stories. 

01:28:15
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Yeah, that's a good question. And the only answer I can give is how long should a person's legs be long enough to reach the ground, not much of an answer but the question is as appropriate. If you think it's helpful, if you think it's got, got some merit, I think, you can go on with it but at the same time as reality therapiess, we do have an agenda, not a corrosive agenda but we have an agenda of trying to get people involved with each other, get them to self-evaluate, get them to make some plans. And I think, if the monologue is facilitates that process then that's, that's fine. If it starts to impede that process, I think, you need to intervene. 

01:29:05
Chapter 12 Closing Remarks 

01:29:05
ROBERT WUBBOLDING Okay, I hope you use the ideas, take what is useful, leave aside what is not useful. This is not a cult. This is not the only way to help people. This is one way I encourage you to integrate other ideas into this if you care too. And as I always say take what is useful, apply it if you care too. And if something happened in this group or something that I said is not appropriate for you to say, don't say it. But anyway I hope this is useful to you, and the best to you in your efforts in using reality therapy.
