FIVE APPROACHES TO CLINICAL SUPERVISION: DEVELOPMENTAL, INTEGRATED, INTERPERSONAL PROCESS RECALL, MICROSKILLS AND THEORETICAL SPECIFIC 

00:00:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN, PH.D PROFESSOR OF HUMAN COUNSELING BRADLEY UNIVERSITY - PEORIA, IL. 

00:00:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Hello, my name is Dr. Lori Russell - Chaplin and I'm a Professor of Education in Human Development Counseling at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois. For the past 17 years, I have been teaching, counseling, and conducting supervision. Being a part of a supervision team and one, is one of my very favorite counseling roles. These experiences have taught me that there are different supervision approaches for meeting supervisee's needs. Today my colleague Bryan Denure and I will present a live demonstration addressing four major clinical supervision models and one supervisory videotaping method. The supervision approaches are developmental, integrated, microskills, theoretical specific, and interpersonal process recall. Portions of Bryan's counseling interview will be shown and then I will supervise the session from these five distinct supervision approaches. Our goal is to offer each of you feedback from each model and ways to interpret the counseling interview depending on supervisory questions and needs. Hi Bryan.

00:02:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Wow... (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:02:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...it's a long time. 

00:02:30
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:02:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Now I know the portions of this, this video that we're gonna be showing Bryan uhm, did you receive permission to show this tape? 

00:02:35
BRYAN DENURE Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
BRYAN DENURE My client there, I worked with Sydney, did sign a, a... (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:02:40
BRYAN DENURE ...consent form. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. Well, tell me a little bit about the case... (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:02:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and then we'll move from there into the DSM-IV-TR Diagnosis. 

00:02:45
BRYAN DENURE Sure, that sounds fine. Uhm, Sydney is a 50-year, 53-year-old Caucasian female ah, recently divorced after having a marriage for about 20 years. Ah, her main presenting problem when she came into counseling was really that of having an adjustment disorder. (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:03:00
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, when she came in, she was having a lot of difficulty with some conflicts ah, between two things really. Having a lot of guilt regarding the desire to get into some new intimate... (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:03:10
BRYAN DENURE ...relationships and still really dealing with a lot of hurt and a lot of pain from, really from the past relationship from her divorce. And so what really focused on through the course of, especially this session and a few other sessions, we're trying to help her kind of, work through some of that hurt, letting go of some of that hurt, and beginning to look at, identifying what her needs are and, and how to make that known to some of her new, new people that she's wanting to get into relationships with; and really getting her to the point where she feels comfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:03:35
BRYAN DENURE ...and is really feeling ah, ah, not as much of that guilt in exploring some of these relationships. Ah, she also has some issues of, of low self esteem, (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:03:40
BRYAN DENURE which for Sydney she has been able to identify and trace those things back really to their origins beginning in her childhood And we do talk a bit about that in the session as well. So the main focus in the counseling sessions really has been exploring some of her feelings and really looking at, getting her to the point where she feels more comfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:04:00
BRYAN DENURE ...exploring new relationships. 

00:04:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN If you were to uhm, at this juncture... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...give her a diagnosis of a DSM-IV-TR, (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:04:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN what would it be Bryan? 

00:04:05
BRYAN DENURE  Uhm, the five axes diagnosis; on Axis I, I really see it being an adjustment disorder chronic with depressed mood. 

00:04:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:04:15
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, on Axis II, ah, would be a v-code V71.09... (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:04:20
BRYAN DENURE ...which is, which is as we know, no diagnosis... (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:04:20
BRYAN DENURE ...on Axis II- 

00:04:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Well, let me stop you just for... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
BRYAN DENURE Sure. Uh-huh. 

00:04:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...a second. Uhm, and you, how did you determine the no diagnosis? 

00:04:25
BRYAN DENURE  Really on Axis II, that, that determination was made by the history that I have gotten... (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:04:30
BRYAN DENURE ...from her. We'd really, in our initial assessment, initial interview, really went through a fairly lengthy biopsychosocial assessment. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:04:40
BRYAN DENURE And really at that point in time, based on what her history is and what I could gather from, from other family members and that there really is, has been no history of anything that would really indicate any... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:04:45
BRYAN DENURE ...kind of personality disorder. 

00:04:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:04:50
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, on Axis III, that was deferred. There are no, no medical conditions that I'm aware of past or present. Uhm, on Axis IV really the main thing right now is really some, some family discord that has been created since the divorce, has seems to the be the main thing. On Axis V, the global assessment of functioning at this point in time, I assessed it being about an 80, it should be here... (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:05:05
BRYAN DENURE ...at current level. 

00:05:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  All right. Uhm, so you have a good idea of assessment of Sydney. 

00:05:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN As you always know, I always ask the question what, what is the supervisory question that you bring... (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:05:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...into supervision Bryan? 

00:05:15
BRYAN DENURE  The main question that I have in working with Sydney was really what could I do? How could I help the client get into the process? (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:05:25
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, being able to focus more on affect, being, being able to stay with her feelings. One of the things that, that Sydney tends to struggle with is being able to stay with those emotions. Once she can identify some feelings... (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
BRYAN DENURE ...she had, she has a tendency to, kind of, back off from that and really, kind of, get back into some story telling and getting back into, ah, into her mind so to speak and really staying and getting away from the feeling. So my question really is what can I do to help the client stay focused, (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:05:50
BRYAN DENURE ah, be more in touch with feelings, and really get into process counseling. 

00:05:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So as, as we watch the videotape, those are the things you'd like me to attend to. 

00:05:55
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:05:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. Well, let's go ahead and watch the videotape. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:06:00
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:06:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...probably only we'll get viewers will only get to watch about 15 minutes of it but I think it's enough, Bryan, for them to get an idea of, of your skills and perhaps some of the areas of strengths and possi, possibly areas... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
BRYAN DENURE Sure(ph). 

00:06:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...of, uhm, well, things you might want to improve upon. 

00:06:15
BRYAN DENURE All right. 

00:06:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN How would that be? 

00:06:15
BRYAN DENURE Sounds good. 

00:06:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. Great. Thanks. 

00:06:15
SYDNEY  His self worth was itself is his strength. He wasn't really tall. He's about 5'10" or 5'10 1/2" but otherwise he's very muscular. So all the boys, they were afraid off him because he was really broad-shouldered and not a bit heavy. There weren't any ounce of fat in him during that time. Uhm, and he did have a very, very bad temper which I'm sure he got from his family, and my mom did too. But he was also a jolly person (inaudible ). And uhm, after he had a stroke, when I came home right after school and he was getting assaulted from up here and I'm trying to move with my mother. That's what she can do for me (inaudible ). But it's one of the things she gave me that I was able to give my children. She used to tell me, you know she said, this is your opportunity, this is your chance. You need to go and see where it leads you by the hand. She could not stay here. You know, this is one opportunity that she lets go. And I think it's because she regretted not having done that because when my father was with the service, they were in California for the last year and in San Diego when she moved in, and nobody got out truly before and went back to Texas. And I take truly her word for it. In San Diego, that was, that's part of the main thing. One of them went back to Texas and his family took us. So, you know, they haven't said that (inaudible ) and I think that's why she told me what she did. It's very, very hard to do like I'm gonna say I love you. She I can tell you went to the bathroom and close the door and then say that. You know, when I was sleeping. You know, that always really touched me but yeah, she and I were just in the, and when she told me, you know, you need to go (inaudible ) stay with you. Because for us, you know, we'll take care of ourselves, she needed to go on in order to give yourself a chance and give yourself a life. And it's hard to say she loved me. You know what? I don't think I even knew that's what they want. Therefore, they gave me the ability to get my children what it needs(ph). And I look at the papers, there's(ph) kid, the(ph) family, the parents were so involved in their lives. Even people my age and still me how to run your life, that's not right. I know, we have are those children to raise and then our part, our gift is to give them those wings and let them fly and trust in their abilities. 

00:09:00
BRYAN DENURE  Can I ask you something? Where you are right now in your life, if your mom was sitting there, what would she tell you? 

00:09:10
SYDNEY  I haven't (inaudible ). She was so sick at me. I (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:09:18
BRYAN DENURE  Think about, think about that time that you were just recalling when she shared that, that great gift for you from you know, take this opportunity to be (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
SYDNEY I think she would probably chosen it if we want to. (inaudible ) and do it and get on with it. She should be a cheerleader. Uh-huh. She would be (inaudible ). But uhm, yeah, she would have corrected me. But then when I, after we got married with (inaudible ), I remember this was at first year or like the second year we went back home. I could still visualize because I still remember we're standing in a Sears department store it uhm. The mall, I can't remember what it was called now, but it's one word and my aunt was there, and my mother was talking to my aunt. And for the first time I heard her say that she hated my father and that she would look at him, you know, she would stop taking care of him now, that she was going to leave him. And then he had a stroke. She was just waiting for us to get big and you know, get big and you know get out on our own and she was getting ready to leave him. 

00:10:35
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
SYDNEY And then had a stroke and she couldn't leave because she couldn't leave the burden of him, taking care of him on the three of us. So she stayed here and spent the last 45 to, whatever 40 years, less than 30 years. He and Aunt Margaret and Katie and, and ah, trying to get her and it was hard. You know, his fault. And I was telling my kids I would not do that. (inaudible ) I believe. The funny thing is I was doing exactly that. You know I get to the point where I'm happy being here but I couldn't leave. And so the good part is I just, I have a little problem with my emotions for the person that might (inaudible ) now because of the circumstances. You'd probably give me a big favor because I would've just stayed here. And a bit miserable, I did not know miserable I guess until I got out of it. But couldn't remember ever saying that. In a short time, I went to my best friend from both from elementary school through high school, now she's in (inaudible ). We're still good friends. I remember her telling me and I never had the courage to tell him what I do. And tell me (inaudible ) my folks love each other so much. And then at the same time, I know inside me I don't want others would say that. And I think something can be brought the day I heard that. 

00:12:00
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:12:00
SYDNEY So it's some sort of a wall came up between (inaudible ). Because, you know, I know Bob and I when we were dating, we were facing on it. You know, we've talked about it and we looked at it, and we wanted to be, you know, appreciative being with myself. 

00:12:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:12:15
SYDNEY I thought that was good. I had no idea how affected my mother was. She told me and that's why I have to work being in a relationship. She told me to put her way and that's what he wanted her to be. And they never fought for (inaudible ) sort of thing. But with us, but not with each other, (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:12:35
SYDNEY she just always agree with him. But she didn't and she never stood up to him. And ah, she, you know, kept all of her (inaudible )so of course. Just like Bob saying he wasn't, you know, he was bad. Well, you don't really do conscious thing, you work on to it, you do. And I was drawn right into it like my mom. I was terrible. And even though I was a little frightened, he brought here (inaudible ). Uhm, I really am the happiest of my life, I have ever been in these last five years. And I will not say that first year too was great. No, I never hurt so badly my mom. And think one of the ways (inaudible ). I think that's continuing. I didn't know that she can (inaudible ) but I wouldn't. You know, and I have, I knew that was the easy way out, you know. (inaudible ) my kids, my friends, sisters, my husband's family. Everything is going for me so much. Maybe you see that somebody is still inside (inaudible ). I'm saying (inaudible ). Of course, again, there comes my (inaudible ) that's probably good too. How can I do that to all the people that depends on me if I took the easy way out. What would that say to him? He would have gotten (inaudible ). So keep on fogging(ph) all along. What I have, you know, there are few things that I wanted to hear from him. Of course the kids were young to be honest and my mom was worried to death about (inaudible ). You know, it felt normal. And when you do seek their advice, I (inaudible ). Most of the time do the right thing. You just say whatever you want to do, what do you think is the best choice. There I can say you always make the decisions. (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:14:45
SYDNEY So go ahead and make your decision now. You always make(inaudible ). I encourage them and, you know, give them some of that stuff, and talk about I do. And I no longer refer to them that way. I'm not planning to (inaudible ). But uhm, that I, I'm just not afraid of it because I just look at him like this is the last great adventure, because nobody truly knows what happens there. And even if it's like just go to sleep and that's just bad. There's nothing bad about that. If you go into some kind of heaven or something different, you should (inaudible ). So I just, I just look at that as a last great adventure. That, that's really neat not to worry about those people. You know, the kids are young and you worry about what will happen to them if we wouldn't be there for them. As I did have a scare with my breast thing but it turned out to be cancer; but of course being a mom. The kids are gonna (inaudible ) and you prepare yourself dead and buried before the results came back. But at that time, Bob was so much in his own world and stuff too. You know, I thought about that so I worried about my kids or something. My kids are so happy to be here (inaudible ). What else (inaudible ) that I have wonderful, wonderful parents and ah, I think that's my relationship with God, which is much better now when I served Him. But at that point, that (inaudible ) which is that he think he might (inaudible ). So, and that's, you know, I mean, what it's gonna look like, what it's gonna, I don't know (inaudible ). And if I miss something, like right now when I'm feel so confused you know that I'm supposed to be writing something or work on something because that's what he always does. And I know that I am getting impatient 'cause I want the answer right now. 

00:16:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:16:45
SYDNEY That's why I'm getting restless. But if I wait you know at this time, it's gotta have some fairly control yet. Sometimes I will be trouble to site (inaudible ) my wheel than his so I have to watch that. But, you know, I think what I like to be (inaudible )where I am today. It never came to mind. I never even imagined it and be exactly where I am in today. That's why I'm in tears because tears aren't necessarily sadness. 

00:17:20
BRYAN DENURE We can definitely work through and are working through you know, a lot of that pain and that loss that has been there for your life, you know, your relations with your parents and your husband, and still kinda(ph) grappling with, you know, how you're even feeling about yourself and of your relationships and the situations and all that things. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
SYDNEY Yeah. 

00:17:40
BRYAN DENURE Before we wrap up, I guess what uhm, again I'd like to ask you in this session. What, what really kind of, stood out for you, what were the feeling was, what really stood out to you in this session? 

00:17:50
SYDNEY  Maybe the, you know, being able to voice that they say that they caught me in bed. What I do want in life and right now I said as a partner. Ah, you know, on the other hand is, mind if I deserve that or if I'm expecting something that doesn't really exist. It isn't possible. Or should I just settle for what I have. And yet that is what I have always done and I don't want to. And uhm, I no, honestly, I'd rather be on my own. Be by myself the rest of my life than be with a wrong person because I am afraid of time(ph) with me(ph). 

00:18:35
BRYAN DENURE Does that feel like something maybe we should come back to in another session(ph)? (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
SYDNEY Probably because I know that's what I have to improve on. 

00:18:40
BRYAN DENURE  Yeah, well, how about the next time we, kind of, see where things are at and maybe find a way back to that issue and see what we can do. 

00:18:50
SYDNEY But I do know I will say it because I know I have said that he was bossy, which he accepts he is. But I have also realized that a lot of it is my fault. You know, if you let the other person be bossy, of course they'll gonna be bossy with you. I mean, you don't say don't do that. 

00:19:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
SYDNEY How do they know? If I got better about that I might have been, I guess, that's where I started to feel guilty is 'coz I have seen him working with my changes and after I said... (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
SYDNEY ...that to him, he had to play cards one night with a bunch of people and went very late at home which you don't like (inaudible ). Because you, even if he had that many friends, so he is, I am so glad that he is making friends because he needs it, and even if he is seeing somebody else. That's the person that should (inaudible ) in his life then I am glad for him. But the jerk was gonna say, well you're a loser. Well, no I'm not a loser because if he finds the person he should be with, that would in it's own way give relief for me. Because, ah, uhm, you know, I'm very positive he is. You know, (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
BRYAN DENURE He had some (inaudible ) 

00:19:53
SYDNEY I like that he keep that friendship with me. But I don't know if that could (inaudible ) and I don't know it's a (inaudible ) you know. I do have better friends obviously. 

00:20:05
BRYAN DENURE That I think comes back again when to you're not being able to verbalize your needs. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
SYDNEY Uh-huh. 

00:20:10
BRYAN DENURE You verbalize things as they come up and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
SYDNEY Yeah. 

00:20:10
BRYAN DENURE ...moves to lay in (inaudible ) and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
SYDNEY Uh-huh. 

00:20:15
BRYAN DENURE ...it's not a drastic. 

00:20:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Bryan, the audience has had a chance now to view your, 15-minute portion of your tape. What I'd like to do now is to demonstrate these five supervision, kind of, models and techniques. I prepared a handout for us so I'm gonna go ahead and give that to you. These just the categories of counseling supervision. What I'll be doing is showing you the different, an example of each of the models of talk a little bit about a basic tenet and perhaps the supervisor role. And then I'm gonna supervise you from each of each of these different models and techniques. 

00:20:50
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:20:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  The very first one is the developmental model. The example I'm gonna be using is this Stoltenberg, McNeil and Delworth. It's the developmental model. And the basic tenet, Bryan, is this that as you can see supervisees grow at individual paces with differing needs and styles of learning. 

00:21:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:21:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Now, here the supervisees roles. My role would be this that if you were a brand new student, brand new uhm, supervisee, I'd probably put on my teacher hat. If I were at level two, Uhm, I would, I, I see your basic skills are done, I just need to provide you with some... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:21:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...structure and maybe encouragement. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:21:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN The advance level three it says, you know, you come to me and say, Lori, uhm, you know, these things are going well but what do you think about this? So at level three I just listen and I, I offer suggestions as you might need. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:21:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And this master counselor level. I'm, I'm really just your colleague and consultant. And what I think is real interesting about this tape with Sydney is that, I would say most of the time Bryan, who needs a supervision, I'm at this master counselor level 4 with you. 

00:21:55
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:21:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN You come in and say here's what I think, what do you think about this. But what I'm really excited about with this tape for you Bryan is that you had the courage to bring me a tape uhm, that's really, you're treading in different territory.(crosstalk) 

00:22:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm, absolutely. 

00:22:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN As I think about it, you usually give me tapes with males... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh.(crosstalk) 

00:22:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...who are addicted...(crosstalk) 

00:22:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:22:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  I mean in any, any capacity, uhm, they tend to have behavioral concerns and they're, they're in big crisis. 

00:22:20
BRYAN DENURE Correct. 

00:22:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Here comes a person, here comes Sydney, she's female. Her concerns are certainly not crisis... (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and so I think this is a very different population for you. 

00:22:30
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, it definitely is. 

00:22:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so your question, your supervisory question was wonderful. You said to me, uhm, you know, how do I keep her focused? Well in, in your old population, you knew exactly how to do that Bryan. (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:22:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN, PH.D PROFESSOR OF HUMAN COUNSELING BRADLEY UNIVERSITY - PEORIA, IL. 

00:22:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And uhm, and oftentimes you could get the feelings very well too. So I'm gonna focus just a little bit with Sydney. 

00:22:45
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:22:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I'm gonna be at this probably uhm, level one, level two because as you, and I hope this makes sense that this has nothing to do with your skill level... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:22:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...but you have a new population. 

00:22:55
BRYAN DENURE Absolutely. 

00:22:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So I'm gonna ask you a little a bit. Uhm, talk to me a little bit, Bryan, about why do you think in this tape, you were much less directive... (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:23:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and very much uhm, into silence and active listening. 

00:23:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:23:10
BRYAN DENURE, M.A. BROMENN HOSPITAL BLOOMINGTON, IL 

00:23:10
BRYAN DENURE I've, I really think the main reason for that is a lot of what you said. I'm really used to dealing with clients who have ah, issues that, that present being in crisis, things of that nature. So for, in Sydney's case, it was, she had a lot of her answers. Uhm, she really needed some direction as far as which avenues to take... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:23:30
BRYAN DENURE ...and some encouragements. So for me that was definitely departure from when I was kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:23:35
BRYAN DENURE ...used to. So at the moment during the session, it kind of felt like maybe it's time for me to just kinda sit back, take a different role, do some listening and, and kind of hopefully guide things from there. 

00:23:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, and to be honest its certainly from my, on my end of things, uhm, a little bit unsure, ah, being kind of unsure as far as which direction... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
BRYAN DENURE ...really to take her uhm, because she was functioning at a fairly, at a fairly decent uhm, status. It wasn't needing uhm, you know, crisis resolution or anything like that. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:24:05
BRYAN DENURE So for me it was somewhat difficult to really, kind of, assess you know, where do I fit in, in this situation... (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:24:10
BRYAN DENURE ...and, kind of, what can I do from here. 

00:24:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  And so I'm wonderin', if I put on my teacher hat here. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I'm wondering if what of the things you could do Bryan when you work with a new clientele, a new population. I'm wondering if it would be wise for you to say to her, You know Sydney, and tell me what you think about this. Sydney, uhm, honestly this is sort of a new situation for me and I'm a little bit uhm, it's a little bit different than the population I'm working with. And by doing that, tell me what you think might happen to Sydney? 

00:24:35
BRYAN DENURE  Well, I, I think, I think one thing that would happen is it would certainly help that relationship, (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:24:45
BRYAN DENURE establish that rapport so that uhm, she can understand, kind of, where I'm coming from as well. 

00:24:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:24:50
BRYAN DENURE And I think that would help her feel a little bit more comfortable with me. 

00:24:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Uh-huh. 

00:24:55
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, being able to be forward and honest with her that I don't have all the answer, that I'm you know, I'm not gonna be... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Uh-huh. 

00:25:00
BRYAN DENURE ...able to come in here and know exactly what, what you need to do or anything like that, that you know, I'm human too... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:25:05
BRYAN DENURE ...and, and I always don't have those answers. So and the thing I think for me it really would help me, is to be able to, kind of, take off that, maybe that, that nervousness or that sense of apprehension on my part... (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:25:15
BRYAN DENURE ...that it is okay to be able to tell the client that you know, I, I don't have all the answers... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Absolutely. 

00:25:20
BRYAN DENURE ...and your situation is a bit different than, (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:25:20
BRYAN DENURE than what I'm usually you know, dealing with. 

00:25:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  What's so fascinating when I watched the tape of Sydney... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:25:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...is that one of her major issue was that of trust. 

00:25:25
BRYAN DENURE  Uh-huh. 

00:25:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so I think by your doing that Bryan, (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:25:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN she would say, okay this man has been honest with me. And it was also an issue of trust with men. 

00:25:35
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:25:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So this man is being honest with me and I think it would really make a difference in your level of security as well as Sydney's. 

00:25:40
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, I agree. 

00:25:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I also want to encourage you Bryan because I love the fact that you were silence with, you had silence with her. Uhm, I thought that you were extremely encouraging to her. 

00:25:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And she ate up the fact that you were listening to her. So I think your paraphrase her souls(ph) reflections they were just powerful. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So I just really want to encourage you the next time that happens to uhm, maybe be more genuine... (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
BRYAN DENURE Alright. 

00:26:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...with her. Does that make some sense? 

00:26:05
BRYAN DENURE Absolutely, yeah. 

00:26:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So that, that's if we were doing, we would this uhm, for probably a whole hour Bryan. But that's sort of the basic structure where you know, I choose based upon where you are. And uhm, normally, I think I have ma, the master counselor level four but today I was a little bit more teacher. 

00:26:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:26:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN A little bit more maybe... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...uhm, encourager. What, what do you think would be a benefit of a developmental supervision model for you? 

00:26:30
BRYAN DENURE I think for, for me at this point in time is really just what you had said, is because this is a new population for me. Really in those level one, level two, (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
BRYAN DENURE they are being able to provide that, that supervision being able to put on that teacher's role, that teacher's hat, and helping me kind of see where, what directions I might need to go in. Uhm, I definitely do like the, that providing structure and the encouragement. I think that's definitely helpful ah, specially with those client set that you don't have a lot of... (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
BRYAN DENURE ...uhm, experience in working with. Uhm, and when you do 'coz when you do sort of to get stuck or kind of feel a little bit apprehensive about where you're gonna go with it having that ability... (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
BRYAN DENURE ...to uhm, look at what stage of, of your own development you're at and being able to kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
BRYAN DENURE ...match that to where the client is as well. 

00:27:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So you can see that when you are a supervisor that one of the things you might want to do is make sure that you understand where your client is and where your supervisee is. 

00:27:25
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:27:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So that you can kinda pick and choose the kind of, supervision that you'd like to do. 

00:27:30
BRYAN DENURE Absolutely. 

00:27:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. Well, that would be developmental. Let's move on to. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Let's move on to the integrated models and I'm gonna give two different uhm, examples of integrated. 

00:27:45
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:27:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But the very first one would be the discrimination model which is integrated. It's the bad, it's Bernard and Goodyears' model. And here's the basic tenet. Supervisees benefit from those supervisors who work from multiple theoretical orientations. And so it's wonderful that if you are this flexible as a supervisor, you can be eclectic and choose, kind of, whatever you need. With the Bernard and Goodyear's discrimination model. Here are the supervisor's role. Uhm, you want to respond flexibility with whatever is called for and the big thing is that you wanted to choose three processes and three foci. And here's what, here I'll talk to you a little bit about uhm, the roles and the focus. The process would be where you examine your communication with your clients. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:28:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So when you're with Sydney in this tape, uhm, what were the certain kind of communication things that I did that was helpful and things as a counselor I did that were not helpful. 

00:28:35
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:28:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Conceptualization would be, let's talk about the intention behind those skills. (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So explore intentions behind why you chose a particular skill. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:28:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And the last one is personalization. Identify mannerisms used to interact with your clients and body language intonation, some things like that. And I found a really good one that you did in this tape that, that uhm, that I think would be fun to explore. So, well I wanna talk a little bit about, probably with the conceptualization and personalization. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:29:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And the first one would be again, Bryan, uhm, the intention behind, and, and I thought this was really interesting, uhm, you had a, a chance during the latter part of the tape where you said to her, Sydney, you found out that her mother was a very important part of her, her life. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:29:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And there was a point where you said to her uhm, what would your mother think about this? What was your intention behind that? 

00:29:25
BRYAN DENURE  I think at that point in time if I remember that correctly, my intention was really to try and help her understand that her mind set kind of how she tends to look at things. Other people are gonna have maybe a different way of looking at that. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh. 

00:29:40
BRYAN DENURE And really did to, to help her get some source of strength and support that her mom would support her. That if she was gonna be honest...(crosstalk) 

00:29:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:29:50
BRYAN DENURE ...with herself and ask that question to her mom that she'd kinda be surprised. Maybe mom would tell her something you know, (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
BRYAN DENURE something positive, giving her some strong feedback. She'd always, always said that her mother was a, was the source of strength for her. Somebody who has always... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
BRYAN DENURE ...tended to be in her corner. And she has a lot of times that she tends to self, do a lot of self doubt, not having a lot of confidence in her... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
BRYAN DENURE ...own abilities or skills. And so I, what my real goal was really trying to get her to see that uhm, that one person who is always there for you would've agreed with what your decision... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:30:20
BRYAN DENURE ...was, would've been there to support you in that situation too. 

00:30:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So to some degree, it was like ah, giving her additional resources... (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:30:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...that she could use when she's trying to, when she says she's confused in this additional tension. (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:30:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Let's move to this personalization. This is one of my favorite parts of the tape. Uhm, you were listening well Bryan and you were thinking I could just see the wheels turning. Every once in a while, you'd whip back in your chair and you put one finger on your face like this and then there was a point towards the end of the tape where you actually put two fingers on the tape and you're leaning back on your chair. 

00:30:50
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:30:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN What is, what was that about? What were you doing? 

00:30:50
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, well, one of the things, and, and it actually kind of going back to the process, one of the things as far as the ah, the examining communication is Sydney is a very verbal client. Uhm, She talked quite a bit. 

00:31:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Uh-huh. 

00:31:05
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, one of the things that I, that, that I think I struggled with was, was keeping her focused. It was part of our sup, original question... 

00:31:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
BRYAN DENURE ...and she tend to get into a lot of the stories, a lot of story telling... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
BRYAN DENURE ...and try to, I think it is, my interpretation is that I was trying to give me some background information so that I could, kinda have a sense of where she was coming from. 

00:31:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
BRYAN DENURE And when I would tend to lean back and do that, really what that was and as I looked at the tape, I could really tell that... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:31:30
BRYAN DENURE ...that was me kind of settling back and starting to listen to her story. And part of that and all, it was really, you know, okay we're getting into a story now and in my mind, I was trying to figure out how can I get her back to, how can I certainly do some process? How can I reduce back into maybe getting back more into affect and things like that. 

00:31:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:31:50
BRYAN DENURE 'Coz with those stories, she started, she really tended to get away from the focus of... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:31:55
BRYAN DENURE ...a bit of the session or maybe a particular issue that was brought up... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh-huh. 

00:31:55
BRYAN DENURE ...at that point in time. 

00:31:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  I also noticed in the tape that at one point, uhm, well several points, Sydney began to cry. 

00:32:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And, and Bryan I want you, kind of think about this. You did it so well and you, you've reflected several times. But at one point she started to cry and you very quickly got her out of that... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:32:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and asked her a question. 

00:32:15
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:32:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN What do you think might be behind that feeling(ph)? 

00:32:20
BRYAN DENURE Hmm, I think part of that probably would, would be my desire to kind of really start to maybe identify... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
BRYAN DENURE ...some issues uhm, because I, I know that I was frustrated at times during the session. Uhm, because I saw that, that there, there was a lot of avenues that we could go down and we could explore. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
BRYAN DENURE That, that tended to and, and I guess, in my mind kind of side tracked... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
BRYAN DENURE ...a little bit with some stories. So I think part of my intention behind doing that or unconscious intention, I guess, (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
BRYAN DENURE ...was really to uhm, try and to get back to exploring... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
BRYAN DENURE ...maybe some connections between some of these past behaviors, past patterns... (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
BRYAN DENURE ...of thinking, and things like that. And so I think it, that was at the expense of really being able maybe explore... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 

00:33:05
BRYAN DENURE ...some of that affect. 

00:33:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Because I was wondering too and it goes back to the supervisor question... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...if, Well, that it's pretty much what we did in developmental supervision is asking you to be genuine. I wondered, (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:33:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...didn't noticed but occasionally when you went like this, I knew what you're to do but I wondered if the client would think and you were so good at, honestly Bryan, listening to her. But I sensed a little bit, you said frustration, I even sensed a little bit of, this may not be right, boredom... (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...to some degree. Like how do I get her out of this content and move her back into process and affect. And I'm wondering if it wouldn't be wise for you to maybe just share. Sydney, I'm frustrated a little bit because, you know, you are so verbal and I love hearing you... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:33:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...talk, but every time I get into the feeling, (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN you, you know, you kinda back away. 

00:33:45
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:33:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So I see a theme here as we go through these different models even Bryan. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. I see them. 

00:33:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I see the theme of asking me to be as genuine with your clients as possible. 

00:33:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:33:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Does that make any sense? 

00:33:55
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, absolutely. And, and after reviewing the tape I, I can certainly tell that as well that, I, and I think that it would've, it would've added a great deal to the session and really to, to our rapport. And, and like... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
BRYAN DENURE ...you had said earlier and about the trust. Uhm, but I was, I was apprehensive about doing that. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
BRYAN DENURE  Uhm, for fear of, you know, what could happen if she didn't feel that I was, I was interested in what she had to say. Uhm, so I do believe there was certainly part of behind some of her story telling was to try and help me understand... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
BRYAN DENURE ...uhm, but I do agree that, that a lot of that was defocusing in a sense, (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
BRYAN DENURE ...and ah, getting away from maybe some of those painful feelings in it. 

00:34:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Let's take a look at then at, at, at this discrimination model. How could you see this kind of model being helpful to you as a, as a student, as a, a counselor, or maybe as a supervisor Bryan? (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. I, I like the idea that it really kind of takes it you know, the process, the conceptualization, the personalization really explores each one of those items. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
BRYAN DENURE And it can really help you examine uhm, the commun, the interpersonal communication between you and your client right... (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
BRYAN DENURE ...there in that session. And as, as we just talked about in this session, for me it clearly kind of magnified some things that, that I really wasn't even aware of... (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:35:10
BRYAN DENURE ...that I was even doing. So, I think this model really can help a person look at you know, how do your man, what kind of message are your... (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
BRYAN DENURE ...mannerism is sending you know, if you put a finger up. (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:35:20
BRYAN DENURE What does that, that communicate to the client? And also being able to examine uhm, and talk about and really zero in on... (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
BRYAN DENURE ...the intentionality. You know, about what skill you're trying, or to choosing and, and what is your goal with that, and how do you know did you, did you get there... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
BRYAN DENURE ...or didn't get there with it. And what, what might to be different. 

00:35:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Well and I think the nice thing about that then is you're having this great therapeutic relationship with your client. But what's really nice about it is that they think I wonder what this means. (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN It may be something very different. (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:35:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so if you can communicate that Bryan, I think that would be very helpful. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:35:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Let's go to the second model... (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:35:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  of integrated uhm, model list of supervision. This is the one, Bryan, that uhm, I created, the microcounseling supervision model. This is probably the one... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...that you're very familiar with... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
BRYAN DENURE Absolutely. 

00:36:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...because we used it a lot... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...in class. Let's go to the basic tenet though. The supervisees benefit from a standardized approach. So everyone in supervision is using the same kind of thing whether you're in peer supervision or individual like today. Uhm, and what I'm doing is we're helping you review the tapes, (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...offering feedback to the tapes, evaluating and then of course processing the skills. 

00:36:20
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:36:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Your role as a supervisor would be to use the counselor interview rating form and I do have that here. I, I watched the entire tape and I'll show it to you. (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:36:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I bet you're dying to get... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
BRYAN DENURE Yes. (laughs) 

00:36:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...into that line I'm sure. Uhm, But to use the counselor interview rating form... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...as a mechanism for creating this reciprocal processing that we do together. And of course the main goal is to offer you constructive feedback. And then also, uhm, what the supervisor could do is to choose from these three main components and here are the three main components of microcounseling supervision. You're reviewing the skills with intention. You probably remember that a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And we classify the skills. That's what I'm doing when I do the counselor interview rating... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:37:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...form. And then we'd process those supervisor needs. And so what I'd like to do is to really focus again on your, your supervisory question but I wanna show you the counselor interview rating form. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:37:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN You've got a big smile on your face. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:37:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN You haven't seen this in a few months, have you? (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
BRYAN DENURE  Yeah, it's been a while. 

00:37:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And I want to focus on that Bryan because I want to do a couple of things when we look at this form. First of all, I want you to look at the skills that are there. You're gonna see, wow I, I used, I did a lot of skills. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And then I want you to look at the skills you did not use. So the very first prong, it's a three-pronged process, would be first of all to take a look at any of these skills, the micro and the macroskills. And I'll just let you to take a quick look at 'em. Are there any of them, first of all Bryan, that you need to uhm, have clarified? My guess is you may not but if you do I'll talk to you about them. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
BRYAN DENURE No, as, I, I understand them. 

00:37:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:37:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So that's, so if you were a supervisor and the person says, we'll guys you know, I'm really, I don't know what a behavioral description is then you would certainly clarify that... (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:37:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and you can move on. 

00:37:55
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:37:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN The next stage would be to have us rate the fo, using this form and, uhm, and what I would ask you to do is just take quick look, and I'm gonna, I hope you can read everything that I wrote Bryan. (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  But let's take a look at the microskills. You hit every single microskill. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:38:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  I mean it's amazing to me. There were two I circled that you did not. Uhm, I did not see a perche, perception check. 

00:38:20
BRYAN DENURE Uhm. 

00:38:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN In other words, to say to Sydney, you know. Did(ph), is this, am I accurate, am I on target here? I didn't see that. 

00:38:25
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:38:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I believe she knew you were on target because she kept saying, yeah, you know, when I come in here, you're always listening to me and you, you make me cry, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
BRYAN DENURE Uhm. 

00:38:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So I, I believe that uhm, that she knew that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:38:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But I think that would be a skill that would be wise to use. 

00:38:35
BRYAN DENURE Absolutely. 

00:38:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I didn't see any clarification either. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uhm, for example, when she talks about trust, (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...you know, I think that's one of those words that we use globally... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
BRYAN DENURE Wow. 

00:38:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...but her trust and your trust definition would be very different. 

00:38:50
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:38:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So I'd like you to, kind of zoom in on that. Uhm, if we move down to problem solving skills, check at, look at this. This is what we're talking about. You had a goal for the session. 

00:38:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  You were certainly trying to understand her concern. I thought you did a beautiful job at that. I mean had five different times that you were really trying to get into the depth of her concern. You were trying to evaluate her alternatives but this is where I thought... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...you fell short and... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:39:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...I hope you knew that. 

00:39:10
BRYAN DENURE  Yeah. 

00:39:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN It's that when you left, you didn't say, Sydney, you know, I want you to try to do this. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And ah, so that's where(ph), I thought probably on that area it was okay. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:39:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I'd like you to work on there. Take a look at this one though. When you were doing the action phase Bryan, she, she got you to just(ph) do some self disclosing about the flowers and giving flowers to your wife. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  I hope you remember that. But I think it would be really fun for you and this is the answer to your supervisory question, I think, immediacy. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN There were several times where I thought you could have done immediacy. 

00:39:45
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:39:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And uhm, I wrote them down for you here. But uhm, if you can, give me your definition of, of immediacy. If you were using that intentional skill, (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:39:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN What would that be? 

00:39:55
BRYAN DENURE For me I think immediacy really means that when something presents itself in the session, uhm, to address it, to, to go right at it. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Exactly. 

00:40:05
BRYAN DENURE ...uhm, not to I guess, trying to maybe postponed it and tie it back later on. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:40:10
BRYAN DENURE But this, if, if something is, is presented and ah, the say something to, kind of maybe stop the session... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
BRYAN DENURE ...and, and you know, I, I noticed this. Can we... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
BRYAN DENURE ...maybe talk about this situation or whatever it was that was said. So you would be able to kind of uhm, maybe stop the flow of things and really kind of zero in on something that has happened or something that has been said. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah, it could. Here now, what's happening right now. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
BRYAN DENURE Right. Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And I think that's gonna help you in answering your supervisory question. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:40:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  How do I keep her focused, how do I keep her down in here? (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And here is one of the things I wrote down. Uhm, Sydney says to you, "It is easy to be honest with you. It's really hard for me to be honest with other people." And you, you were silent. And so what I was suggesting, I wonder if this would be a great immediacy. Think about what could you say that would take her out of our story and bring her right back down into counseling. What do you think you might could say to her. She says, "It's easy to be honest with you but hard to be honest with others." 

00:41:00
BRYAN DENURE  I might exa, I might be basically exer, examine, you know, maybe ask to having her or give me a situation, tell me when it has been hard to be ah, you know, be honest with other people. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
BRYAN DENURE Can you think of any situation here recently where it's been difficult to be honest with someone. 

00:41:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And, and I think that would be a great plan but, and how, how was it easy to do this with me? 

00:41:20
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN What's going on with us? That's the immediacy. What's happening here... (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:41:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...with us that will allow you to be trusting and honest with other people. So what are we doing in here. 

00:41:30
BRYAN DENURE What? 

00:41:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I think that will make a really big difference. So I want you to, kind of think about that. We go to the rest of them. Uhm, closing and generalization. I thought you did a, a, a really concise job Bryan because you summarized her content and feeling. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN You rescheduled, I loved your evaluation of the session and I think this is also a supervisory uhm, answer to your question. You asked the question what stood out in the session? (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN She, she told you. She said I really appreciated this and I appreciated that. But I think you can even use a process there too and say, here's what I liked about the session, Sydney. (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And, and, and again focusing and bringing it down. Does that make any sense? (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. Absolutely. 

00:42:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Okay. So I thought you used all the skills really nicely. I'd, I'm gonna give this to you later Bryan so you can, kind of look at the voids. But I want to focus just a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:42:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...on some one-liners that you, I think, hit on and then you, you could've expand it. And I think this will help you with answering your supervisory question. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:42:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I think three different times in, in the tape, Sydney says, "I'm a loser." Do you remember that? She says... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. 

00:42:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I'm going to, when I pick mates, when I pick partners, I tend to, to choose the underdog. (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
BRYAN DENURE The underdog, yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:42:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And then she said and then I choose the loser. And I think if you could have taken those one liners, (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh-huh. 

00:42:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...the one that I keep hearing over and over in the tape and just focus on them. 

00:42:50
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:42:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I think you would have gone her out of content, into her affect and into process. 

00:42:55
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:42:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Does that make any sense? 

00:43:00
BRYAN DENURE Oh, absolutely. 

00:43:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. Uhm, again, I love the question that you ask of what would you, you know, what you have your mom tell you to do now. I thought that was just the really... (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...example of getting out of content and moving into process. I thought that was a great one. Uhm, now, I'm almost done here, Bryan, it's so painful I know. (laughs) Uhm, but do you remember at the very end of the tape she says to you I'm not a loser. So... (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...whatever you did worked, ah, you have to know that your intentional skills did work. Uhm, so I thought that was really one of those, the, the, big strengths of the tape. 

00:43:30
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:43:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  So with that in mind, I have told you some of the things I thought your strengths were. Tell me what you thought your strengths were? 

00:43:40
BRYAN DENURE, M.A. BROMENN HOSPITAL BLOOMINGTON, IL 

00:43:40
BRYAN DENURE Well, ah, I, I too like some of the things that I did, the silence, the personal paraphrasing, uhm, I definitely like those things. I think one that, one of the interesting things if we were to compare, this uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:43:50
BRYAN DENURE this one to maybe one of my other sessions, maybe we probably would see a lot of differences where, you know, some of the directives, some of the confrontation that really wasn't there in this session... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN With this one. 

00:44:00
BRYAN DENURE ...that really would have been there in some other sessions. So uhm, I, and I think for me being able to uhm, utilize some of that silence is really... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:44:10
BRYAN DENURE ...is a way to kind of uhm, take in some of that story certainly it helped, (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
BRYAN DENURE ...has helped me to, kind of understand where she's coming from. Uhm, I think there's one. 

00:44:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Sure, go and take it if you want. 

00:44:20
BRYAN DENURE  And I think the perception check, I think too, that I, I know that I did not use that often or at all, uhm, would have been helpful too, to again kind of maybe establish that trust... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
BRYAN DENURE ...and, and check in with her, (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:44:35
BRYAN DENURE "You know, Did I get that?" Is that accurate? (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN We're on the right track here. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
BRYAN DENURE Exactly. Uhm, and I definitely agree what you have said, you know, the exploring and understanding concerns. It's something that I, that, that certainly during the session I really felt that I was... (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:44:45
BRYAN DENURE ...really, really consciously aware that I was trying... (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:44:50
BRYAN DENURE ...to do that, uhm, during intentionally trying to uhm, be aware of, of what kind of issues, what kind of problems we're going on. Uhm, and I, and I, one of the other things too, the implementing alternatives, uhm, something that I'm, I'm usually, you know, right on top of, you know, (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:45:06
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Oh, you're so, oh yeah, you are so focused on that. 

00:45:06
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, usually. Usually, looking at it, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:45:06
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Isn't that interesting? (crosstalk) 

00:45:06
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, and in this session I didn't do it. It didn't happen. So that, that's for me is, is, is I guess a little bit frustrating 'coz I know that's an important part... (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
BRYAN DENURE ...of the counseling processes, to examine... (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
BRYAN DENURE ...those alternatives and what does make it different. 

00:45:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But Bryan I want to make sure you understand this though. But can you see that with different populations, (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. 

00:45:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I think you can get her to implement alternative soon. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, absolutely. 

00:45:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But perhaps I just want you to think, perhaps, it was wise for you to take it slowly. Uhm, the thing I knew though that this is probably your third tape with her. 

00:45:35
BRYAN DENURE I believe so, yeah. 

00:45:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so I want, I really want you to continue to do that... (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...so we can generalize, skills can generalize from population to population. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:45:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN, PH.D PROFESSOR OF HUMAN COUNSELING BRADLEY UNIVERSITY - PEORIA, IL. 

00:45:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But I think you do have to assess their developmental level and you did with Sydney. So just be aware of that and I, (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:45:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I think that's a great place to be. 

00:45:45
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:45:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  The only thing I want to bring out and then we'll move on to the next one was uhm, towards the end of the tape, Bryan, you did say to her about the issues of loss. There's so many things Sydney that you have lost. Relationships, her parents, and I think that would be another way to get her out of content... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and into process, by really focusing on those, (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN, PH.D PROFESSOR OF HUMAN COUNSELING BRADLEY UNIVERSITY - PEORIA, IL. 

00:46:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...those areas of loss. And you did, you really did it. I mean your question was, Sydney, and I think your statement was something about even a loss of a dream. 

00:46:15
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:46:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  And I think... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:46:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...you could have just expanded that and continue to look on that. (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Does that part make sense? (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. Absolutely. Yes, it does. 

00:46:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So we could go to the - 

00:46:30
EXAMPLE: ROGERIAN SUPERVISION MODEL, 1961 RATIONAL EMOTIVE BEHAVIORAL SUPERVISION, WOODS & ELLIS, 1996 BASIC TENET: SUPERVISEES BENEFIT FROM A SUPERVISION PROCESS THAT FOCUSES ON THE THEORETICAL ORIENTATION BEING PRACTICED IN COUNSELING. 

00:46:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN -theoretical specific models. This supervision model is really fun to do... (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...because whatever your theoretical orientation is, all you are trying to do is match it. The example of that uhm, we could use today would be Rogerian. 

00:46:40
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:46:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uhm, could be rational emotive behavioral therapy, it could be a Adlirian Union(ph). I mean we could go on and on. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:46:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So you, so what the supervisor does is that you pick the same ah, theoretical orientation that your supervisee brings to you... (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and again, that's the basic tenet. Supervisees benefit from a supervision process that focuses on the theoretical orientation being practiced in counseling. Your role as a supervisor would then provide supervision in accordance with the tenets... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...of the counseling theory. So this one is really fun I think. And uhm, if I had to ask you Bryan, what, what theoretical orientation where you using in this, in this video? And by the way it's very different than what I've ever seen you do. (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Ah, would definitely be the Rogerian. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. (clears throat) 

00:47:25
BRYAN DENURE The Rogerian than, than what I, what I usually do... (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
BRYAN DENURE ...uhm, tend to be more, more cognitive behavioral and some of the other things that I do uhm, REBT, those kinds of things as well. 

00:47:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so from looking at this client and being with Sydney, you did, you assessed and said, "What I need more than anything is to use active listening skills with her. I need to use those basic attending skills... (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:47:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and I believe she knows where she's going and so my job is just to, kind of feed, feed that back to her." (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:47:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Is that accurate? 

00:47:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:47:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Okay. 'Coz I really, I really saw that in the tape. I would have said it was Rogerian which I have never seen. So for me to watch this tape, (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:48:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN it was like wow! This is really different (laughs) for Bryan. But what it says Bryan is that you're very flexible. You've got a lot of different skills and you can use them... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...depending on what your clients need. I also saw, saw towards the end of the tape though some Gestalt. I saw a little Adler in there. 

00:48:20
BRYAN DENURE Uh. 

00:48:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN (clears throat) She spent a lot of time talking about feeling insecure. 

00:48:20
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. Yes. 

00:48:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  And Bryan I thought this is really interesting 'coz she says I'm feeling insecure. (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I guess my question to you is, again how are you feeling insecure? 

00:48:30
BRYAN DENURE  Yeah, that's a, that's a good question 'coz, 'coz I certainly had my moments of insecurity... (crosstalk) 

00:48:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:48:35
BRYAN DENURE ...and ah, again, be going back to that it was a different type of client for me and, and, you know, although I, I knew that I was using a lot of those skills, I, you know, it just, it didn't feel like it normally did I guess. 

00:48:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:48:50
BRYAN DENURE And so part of that insecurity for me was am I going in the right direction with this situation? (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
BRYAN DENURE Am I addressing the things I need to be addressing? Am I, am I missing anything? So yeah, I definitely did feel somewhat insecure as well. 

00:49:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So it, in this there's a theme throughout all these, no matter what supervision model we're using. 

00:49:05
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:49:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN What do you think you could have done? If especially when you said in your head, "Am I going in the right direction?" What could have you said to Sydney? 

00:49:15
BRYAN DENURE Well, I said, probably if I was commenting on something or her bringing... (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
BRYAN DENURE ...something up, to make sure that I was, was on cue there really to maybe do a perception check. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Yeah, that would work. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
BRYAN DENURE Am, Am I on base with this? Does this, does this... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
BRYAN DENURE ...make sense to you? (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, or in the beginning ah, we had talked about this kind of, that honestly... (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:49:30
BRYAN DENURE ...in order to kind of developing that rapport and that trust of just kindda letting her know where I was at and that I was uhm, maybe having some of those similar... (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:49:35
BRYAN DENURE ...kind of feelings too. And, and I especially think that with Sydney, that would have, that would have worked very well. (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I see. You have a great rapport with her Bryan. (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:49:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And I think you could have even said to her, "Am I on track Sydney?" 

00:49:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I think you could have said that to her... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:49:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and she would, she would have said yes or no and... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
BRYAN DENURE Yes, she were. 

00:49:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...let me tell you why. (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So I think those are things you really have to think about. 

00:49:55
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:49:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN The other thing that I thought was fascinating was your, your, you chose this kind of variation of an empty chair when you said to her, (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. 

00:50:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uhm, " If your mom were sitting right there, Sydney, what do you think she would tell you about? (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:50:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN whether or not this man is the man you should be marrying." 

00:50:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And I thought it was just very effective. And I want to encourage you Bryan to expand upon that. You did it... (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:50:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and it was like, okay I got and I'm done. (laughs) But I want you to, (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:50:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I want you to massage it. I want you to really... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. 

00:50:20
BRYAN DENURE ...expand upon that, that, that idea. And so I'd like to just work with you just for a second. (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:50:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN If uhm, and I think I'm gonna, I don't know if we can actually move but I'd like you to think about this first. I would like, and if we could, I don't know if we can move the video tape or not but I would like you to, to sit right there. And if, if I know we're doing it in my other office, I'd have you move over there to this chair... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:50:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and I'd like you to talk to your counselor and I want you to be the counselor. So I want you to be the counselor and, and ask yourself uhm, you know, "What shall I do with Sydney? What kind of, what I shall be doing with Sydney?" And as you look at your counselor, what do you think the counselor would say? It's almost like an inner counselor... (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
BRYAN DENURE Yeah, right. Sure. (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:51:08
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...or maybe we can call it the inner supervisor. (crosstalk) 

00:51:08
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:51:08
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  But I need you to give yourself a resource Bryan. Uhm, so if you go, look over that way at least and, and... (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
BRYAN DENURE Hmm. 

00:51:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...what would you, what would you ask, what's the question you would ask and what do you think that supervisor would say? 

00:51:20
BRYAN DENURE I think the question I would ask is, is, "Supervisor what do I need to do to, to get on track, to, to keep this client focused and in getting into the process of counseling." And I think the response would be really is, is to relax Bryan. 

00:51:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:35
BRYAN DENURE  Trust your skills. 

00:51:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Absolutely. 

00:51:40
BRYAN DENURE Be open, be honest. Uhm, and I think that would really ah, I think that's exactly... (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:51:45
BRYAN DENURE ...what I would need to hear because I could really, I could really sense in that, in that, in that tape and I don't know if you could get that... (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
BRYAN DENURE ...same sense from comparing that with some other sessions, is that I was nervous. 

00:51:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah. 

00:51:55
BRYAN DENURE And, and I know that for me when I start to get apprehensive or I have a situation where I don't feel that, that comfortable in dealing with, (crosstalk) 

00:52:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:52:00
BRYAN DENURE  that I will kind of forget. 

00:52:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yes. 

00:52:05
BRYAN DENURE You know, that I do have those skills. You know, a kind of forget some of that self-confidence that I know... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
BRYAN DENURE ...it was there. And so I think the one thing I would need to hear is, is relax and trust yourself. And you know trust your skills. (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN See, that's what I think, Bryan. That's what I think happens is that if you trust yourself, your skills will generalize. (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  And yes, we do sometimes use different skills with different clients... (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:52:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...but they can generalize and they will generalize. And, and that's just an example of you could take that technique you used with Sydney but you can also apply it to ourselves, (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:52:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN because I, I really do believe in the whole issue of counter-transference and transference with clients. And we can now throw, you know, Union or Freud in, (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN but I think there was someone out there that, you know, she was telling you I'm feeling a little insecure and yet there was some of that going on with you as well. 

00:52:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:52:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And uhm, and I think you could have used those same skills you used with your other populations. So, I think that's just something for you to remember. 

00:52:55
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. 

00:52:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  If you were to have supervision from a theoretical specific model, what do you think the benefits might be? 

00:53:05
BRYAN DENURE I think it can really, again, focusing on, on the, the need for that theoretical foundation. 

00:53:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:53:10
BRYAN DENURE And for me, I know that that helps me, kinda understand, you know, where I'm ultimately gonna kinda be tied down to some, some kind of idea... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
BRYAN DENURE ...where I want to go with things. So, I think this, this model of supervision uhm, helps, helps, a person explore, you know, where your theoretical orientation is. Are you staying, are you staying true to that... (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. uh hmm. 

00:53:35
BRYAN DENURE ...or are you integrating other kinds of, of, of orientations and being able to understand, okay, if, if like of this example, like Gestalt. 

00:53:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
BRYAN DENURE Ah, if you're using a modification of that or being able to identify other ways that that might work differently. 

00:53:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
BRYAN DENURE  Uhm, so, if you take maybe one specific uhm, ah, technique that is, is theory-specific and being able to, kind of tweak it or figure out... (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:53:55
BRYAN DENURE ...how can you maybe make that a bit more uhm, more successful maybe... (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
BRYAN DENURE ...or, or getting exactly maybe what you wanted out of it. 

00:54:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  Well, I think it's so nice to be able to have the continuity that if this is how you were counseling, to be supervised by that same or similar theoretic orientation. 

00:54:10
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:54:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN So, I think that allows continuity... (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and it helps you learn how to expand that and modify it and tweak it, as you would say. 

00:54:15
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:54:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN All right. Well let's do our final one, Bryan. The, the first four we were doing actually are, the, the first four we were doing actually are supervision models. 

00:54:30
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:54:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN This last one will be very similar - 

00:54:35
EXAMPLE: KAGAN'S INTERPERSONAL PROCESS RECALL (IPR), 1980 BASIC TENET: SUPERVISEES NEED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN SAFELY ANALYZE THEIR COMMUNICATION STYLES AND STRATEGIES. 

00:54:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN -and I think you'll be familiar with it too. But it's really not a model. It's a videotaping supervision method. The example is from... (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:54:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...Norman Kagan's Interpersonal Process Recall. And you always probably see that in the textbook as IPR. (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. uh hmm. 

00:54:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But uhm, Dr. Kagan was really, I think, fascinating because in supervision he says that much like it's parallel process, that much like in counseling, sometimes clients say to us what we think they wanna hear... (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  and just, I think, that's true in supervision. Sometimes you say to your supervisor what you think they want to hear. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
BRYAN DENURE Want to hear. 

00:55:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so Kagan developed this process where he says, it's the tenet, supervisors, supervisees need an environment where they can safely analyze their communication styles and strategies. (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And we, we do this all the time in supervision, where we watch the video. You probably remember this and then I stop it and I say okay, what's going on here? (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
BRYAN DENURE Yup. 

00:55:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Which is immediacy honestly. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But its' just on a different level. It's more supervision than counseling. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:55:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  And so the supervisor's role is to stop the video tape at anytime and discuss essential personal or counseling issues. And there are probably 20 different kind of questions that have come around using IPR. But I wrote down a couple of them. Needed questions may be, uhm, as the counselor how are you feeling right then? 

00:55:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And, you know, we, we talked a little bit about that. (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:55:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN When you were doing this, (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

00:55:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN or how were you feeling? And I think it came across that, (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:55:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN  no matter what supervision model you were using there were some anxiety, there's a little bit of insecurity. Even though you have incredible skills, and that, that needs to be, I think, shared a little bit with the client. So, here's another question I thought would be fun for us to do today, Bryan. I'm not sure if fun is the right word (laughs) but here's, here's a question I would use. 

00:56:10
BRYAN DENURE Okay. 

00:56:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN What stopped you from sharing your thoughts with your client? When you were sitting there doing this uhm, when you were saying I'm, I'm feeling a little insecure, where are we going, how do I get her back on track? What stopped you from sharing? 

00:56:20
BRYAN DENURE Fear, a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:56:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uhm, of what, Bryan? 

00:56:25
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, again, I guess in my mind kind of how I justify not saying anything... (crosstalk) 

00:56:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:56:30
BRYAN DENURE ...was that it wasn't your client uhm, and I think this was about the third session or so. So, I was just a little fearful that would this uhm, I guess, taint the rapport a little bit? 

00:56:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
BRYAN DENURE, M.A. BROMENN HOSPITAL BLOOMINGTON, IL 

00:56:40
BRYAN DENURE Would it affect uhm, how she was uhm, you know, communicating with me? Would it, (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
BRYAN DENURE  would it affect the counseling process at all if I was to stop and, and uhm, you know, kind of, in the sense kind of say identify... (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
BRYAN DENURE ...that she tended to, kind of divert from some of those feelings by, kinda getting into stories and things like that. So, I was just a bit nervous about doing that... (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
BRYAN DENURE  and really the ultimate end result of doing that. 

00:57:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Were you afraid though that if you did share, and you didn't say this and I wanna make sure that I don't let me put words in your mouth but, were you afraid that if you did share with her even a third session that she might not think you were as skillful as, as you are? 

00:57:20
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. I'm sure that had something to do with it. Uhm, I haven't really quite thought about that but I'm sure there is some of that to that, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. And so, I guess, what I'd like you to think about, even though we just did it very quickly, but what would be the benefit of using IPR in supervision? Stopping the tape when you need it, Bryan. What are the benefits? 

00:57:40
BRYAN DENURE I think the immediacy. You know, in having, in sin, (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
BRYAN DENURE in, since we have done that in the past, and I have done that in the past uhm, you can really zero in on things. You can, you have it right there. It's very concrete example. 

00:57:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
BRYAN DENURE It's on the video tape of something that was a situational technique, whatever. And then being able to stop the tape, talking about it right then and there uhm, it's been my experience for me anyway that if, if, for example, if I watch a whole video tape and at the end trying to go back and do it, it takes away some of that immediacy. (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I agree. 

00:58:05
BRYAN DENURE And really it, kind of, well what segment was that? (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN You kind of lose it. Uh-huh. 

00:58:10
BRYAN DENURE And what might it have been? And so, it does give an opportunity to kind of ah, for, for both the supervisee and supervisor to really uhm, dissect, I guess, that one segment, that one situation and really look at what are some other alternatives, what could have been done differently, those kinds of things. (crosstalk) 

00:58:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. Okay. So, Bryan, what I hear, we, we've gone through all these five distinct methods... (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:58:30
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...of supervision. But I think I'm hearing form you is that you can see value and benefit from each supervision model and the IPR system. 

00:58:35
BRYAN DENURE  Right. 

00:58:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I guess, I'd have to ask you, uhm, and this is how I conclude all my supervision... (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...sessions, you know. What did you get out of supervision today? So, that's first question. But I'm, I'm looking for best fit for you. 

00:58:50
BRYAN DENURE Sure. 

00:58:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uhm, as you look at the different approaches, what did you get out of today and I'm, I'm looking for best fit? (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. I think the best fit for today really seemed to be, uhm, well, it's I'm kinda split. I'm kinda torn, I guess, between two. Uhm, and they're really the, the integrated models. (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
BRYAN DENURE Uhm, and...(crosstalk) 

00:59:05
BRYAN DENURE  So that's interesting. 

00:59:10
BRYAN DENURE ...yeah. I guess, I guess Bernard and Goodyear's Discrimination Model... (crosstalk) 

00:59:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:15
BRYAN DENURE ...uhm, because I could really, I guess, I could really feel and I could really see how the communication between, between Sydney and myself. Ah, you know, how that was affected by some... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:25
BRYAN DENURE ...of the things that were going on. Uhm, some of it matters, like you pointed out... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:59:25
BRYAN DENURE  like the fingers. So I think some of those things, kind of help me really see ah, some things if, if we had not maybe examined or explored... (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
BRYAN DENURE ...some of those mannerisms, I, I might not have been, (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:35
BRYAN DENURE ...I guess, tuned into that a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:40
BRYAN DENURE So that one really ah, was, was a good model for me to, kind of be exposed to. (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
BRYAN DENURE And really seem to fit for me... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
BRYAN DENURE ...for this session ah, with Sydney. Uhm, it's so difficult because they all kind of fit in so. (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN This is what you will say, the Russell-Chaplin Microcounseling Supervision. I'm joking Bryan. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
BRYAN DENURE That one too. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I'm joking. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
BRYAN DENURE And that one again because I'm so used to that one. And I'm used to Howards-Hobbs structure. Bit I'm used to it being able to identify each... (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:00
BRYAN DENURE  skill and, and especially getting in this session, I was really able, I was able to identify those skills... (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
BRYAN DENURE ...and I really I wasn't as sharp with or things that I need to... (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
BRYAN DENURE ...be focusing on. So of course, that, that definitely helps as well. And again, in this, in this particular session, (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:15
BRYAN DENURE ...again, the theoretical uhm, specific model looking at for me, going at, looking at the Rogerian end of it, (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
BRYAN DENURE ...uhm, it's just so different, you know. So. (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Yeah, it's so different for you. 

01:00:25
BRYAN DENURE Yeah. So it's, kind of me uhm, because sometimes at least for myself or anyone that I'm doing a session, I think sometimes that I'm coming from... (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:35
BRYAN DENURE ...a particular theory or angle and when you review a tape like this, you can see that we'll, there's... (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
BRYAN DENURE ...also other flavors there too. (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Absolutely. 

01:00:40
BRYAN DENURE It's not just this one theory... (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
BRYAN DENURE ...in place. And so that helped as well it seemed. 

01:00:45
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN But I think it's interesting though, the first one that you, you gravitated towards with those integrated models... (crosstalk) 

01:00:50
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

01:00:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN, PH.D PROFESSOR OF HUMAN COUNSELING BRADLEY UNIVERSITY - PEORIA, IL. 

01:00:50
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...and I wonder, and this is just sort of hypothetical, but I wonder if we tend to be more eclectic because these, both of those are a theoretical. If that's why we can focus in on those, if those seem to be most helpful. And yet today you said that the theoretical specific made a huge difference for you because it made you think about those Rogerian skills that you used... (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

01:01:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN ...but you don't really focus on that one. 

01:01:10
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

01:01:10
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And so Bryan, I guess I think we met our supervision goal today. 

01:01:15
BRYAN DENURE Uh hmm. 

01:01:15
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN If you remember, the goal was to give you an example of different methods that you can use in supervision. (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

01:01:20
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN Whether you be the counselor or the supervisor. 

01:01:25
BRYAN DENURE Right. 

01:01:25
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN And uhm, and I'm hoping that that will help you as you decide because you're gonna be doing supervision a lot, I'd say, in the very near future. So I'm hoping that uhm, these, just showing you the distinctions have, have made a difference for you. 

01:01:35
BRYAN DENURE Yes. Sure. (crosstalk) 

01:01:35
LORI A. RUSSELL - CHAPLIN I also want to thank you for working with me today. (crosstalk)
