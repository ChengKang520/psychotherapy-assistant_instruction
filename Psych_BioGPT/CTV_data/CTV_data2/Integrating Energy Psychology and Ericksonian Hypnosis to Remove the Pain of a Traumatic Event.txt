Integrating Energy Psychology and Ericksonian Hypnosis to Remove the Pain of a Traumatic Event 

00:00:20
Robert Schwarz, PsyD 

00:00:30
BOB SCHWARZ Well, hi everybody. I am uh… Bob Schwarz and we're here to do a, a demonstration on integrating uh… energy psychology, in this case EFT with Ericksonian Hypnosis, Ericksonian Therapy. Just so I am… I just wanna get a real quick sense how many people know about EFT or, you know, have done, have used it, almost half of you. Okay, interesting, great. All right, so uh… let me just say uh… I already have a, a subject from, from my workshop earlier, so we, that's taking care of. So it says on your hand up that the four steps so that I wanna make sure you get a good grade on the test. So, so the four steps are the first thing you wanna do with, with working with a, with, with anything really, but soon with uh… something traumatic as you need to have the client identify a target, something that's the, the trauma and then they, they're gonna rate, rate it from a scale of zero to ten. And that's step one and then you are going to, we're going to after we do that we're gonna have, uh… we're going to use a uh… a statement uh… that is full of umm… compassion and not judgment which will… it will talk about that and we're gonna activate an energy point in this case. This, this is the, the… and the statement would be it's gonna go along the lines of, even though I umm… blank and that I deeply and completely love and accept myself. So one of the nice things to know about that just, just trauma work in general is, what are we doing? We're having the client stay in contact, we're having the client be non-judgmental. So the point here is it's not just only about the, the, you know, the so-called magic of the points, there's a lot of other things going on in and one of them is staying in contact, being mindful, and, and, and non-Judgmental and compassionate. So then we're going to have the client go through us, staying, continue to stay in contact and umm… tap on various acupuncture points. And then we, the next thing we do is we have a client assess where are you now, and depending on what comes up if, if the client studs go to a zero and everything there's no new information then we're, we're done. And if it's not zero, if there's new data, if new feelings come up, new information comes up then we, we come back to the top and we, we start again and those are the four steps. And we're just going to very gently cycle through until uh… this, you know, till the pain is knocked out of, out of the traumatic event, because that's the important thing to keep in mind, I like just remind people, here's, here's a, the question ism, does the past have any impact on us? And the answer is, no. It's our memory of the past that has the impact on us. So what we're working on is the representation of the memory. So this is supposed to be demonstration, not, not a lecture so let's just get to it. And now, we're gonna call Shannon up and I guess we'll have to get her miced up. Okay, so we just talked really briefly umm… I just, I don't know if there was anything, anything sure for you still want to, you want to work on this event with uh… while you at the time of the car crash and the, the fact that you got all. 

00:03:40
SHANNON Yeah. It wasn't a crash. 

00:03:45
BOB SCHWARZ Just, just a, a bad situation. 

00:03:45
SHANNON Yeah, just yeah, bad yeah. 

00:03:50
BOB SCHWARZ So you were saying that umm… the problem in current time is that when you, well, when you drive you, could you just describe a little bit about what goes on now and then we'll talk about the… 

00:04:00
SHANNON I'm not a very good passenger. 

00:04:05
BOB SCHWARZ You're not… 

00:04:05
SHANNON Very twitchy. 

00:04:05
BOB SCHWARZ You're very twitchy. 

00:04:05
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:04:05
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. 

00:04:10
SHANNON You know, I, I check everybody's blind spots for them as the passenger. 

00:04:10
BOB SCHWARZ Because… 

00:04:10
SHANNON I have a brake up, up here. 

00:04:15
BOB SCHWARZ I see. I didn't know they put brakes there. 

00:04:20
SHANNON I didn't either. It's not very effective. 

00:04:20
BOB SCHWARZ And is that because, and because you're sort of waiting for the something bad to happen yeah. 

00:04:25
SHANNON Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah. 

00:04:30
BOB SCHWARZ So umm… if we're talking in terms of a we're talking the Polyvagal theory, you're, you're, so you're in an alarm, there's a sense the dangers is, is about to. 

00:04:40
SHANNON I'm pretty hyper alert when I'm a passenger. 

00:04:40
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:04:40
SHANNON Much more so than I am as a, way more. 

00:04:45
BOB SCHWARZ Way more than as a driver. 

00:04:45
SHANNON Yeah, with driver I am, yeah. 

00:04:50
BOB SCHWARZ So where, so where does that come from do you think? You, you, you mentioned there was this event that it didn't used to happen and then it started happening and that came back. 

00:05:00
SHANNON Right, umm… well, I have a particular event I think that where I was in the car with somebody who was umm… I didn't know at that time but was intoxicated and uh… umm… I was pregnant with my first daughter. And this person was, got angry with me and decided to drive like hundred miles an hour across all the lanes and… and then that's continued to happen with this person. 

00:05:25
BOB SCHWARZ This person, so you have a… 

00:05:30
SHANNON Not that same situation but just couple weeks ago a very similar situation where umm… the person will mess with other cars like drive around them 100 miles an hour and then slam on his brakes, so it just continues to get reinforced. 

00:05:45
BOB SCHWARZ Right, did you have a relationship with this person, yeah. 

00:05:45
SHANNON This person, yeah. 

00:05:50
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, umm… and so, but you also said if correct me if I'm wrong that umm… Eve, so this person drives poorly shall we say or, or dangerously. 

00:06:00
SHANNON Dangerously, I think anger management issues. 

00:06:00
BOB SCHWARZ Angry? 

00:06:05
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:06:05
BOB SCHWARZ But you, so that would that's the, so there's a real kind of real time, it's not like you're uh… an overreaction necessarily in that in that context. 

00:06:10
SHANNON Right. 

00:06:10
BOB SCHWARZ But you also said that in other contexts where umm… the person isn't driving badly… 

00:06:15
SHANNON Yes. 

00:06:15
BOB SCHWARZ …you still have the reaction. 

00:06:20
SHANNON Right, or even when this person's driving kindly I still had jerk and freak out and, you know. 

00:06:25
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:06:25
SHANNON I have like PTSD I guess. 

00:06:30
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:06:30
SHANNON Probably I don't know. 

00:06:35
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. And so you'd like to, let suppose that what we do just works amazingly well. And umm… you don't have this reaction anymore. You'll see there's lot of pressure but you never know. 

00:06:45
SHANNON I'll be good. 

00:06:45
BOB SCHWARZ Let's just suppose it does, then what, so how do you see your life, so how will life be different with this person uh… because he still may drive badly or… 

00:07:00
SHANNON Uh… yeah, that would be good. He gets very angry umm… when I react that way, he thinks that I do it on purpose. And overreact to make a point about his driving. 

00:07:10
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, I see. So when you don't overreact is because, you're because… well, what we do it's going to be great. 

00:07:20
SHANNON Yes. 

00:07:20
BOB SCHWARZ Umm… then what, how do you see that happen, how's that unfolding with him, so now you're not going to be over reacting so how is that going to be for him. 

00:07:30
SHANNON I think he would appreciate that. 

00:07:30
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, but would he still drive badly or… 

00:07:35
SHANNON Potentially. 

00:07:35
BOB SCHWARZ So what do you think will happen because then… 

00:07:35
SHANNON Then it'll come back, right. 

00:07:35
BOB SCHWARZ I don't know. 

00:07:40
SHANNON I used to just try to play with my phone and not pay attention to his driving. 

00:07:45
BOB SCHWARZ Oh! 

00:07:45
SHANNON But it would be nice not to freak out, my poor friend Jim over here, I've been slamming his dash board all week. 

00:07:50
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:07:50
SHANNON And he drives really nice. 

00:07:50
BOB SCHWARZ So on the one hand you either freak out or you avoid like when it's really bad you're, you're so, you know, so where you might want to think about I might be the Ericksonian side of this, umm… there maybe some other things to do differently. What are you looking for? 

00:08:05
SHANNON My water. 

00:08:10
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, your water, okay, yeah. Does that make sense? 

00:08:10
SHANNON Right, like not getting into car with him? 

00:08:15
BOB SCHWARZ Uh… that's one option I suppose. There might be others. Umm… so if we were to umm… so this other event, this older event, how long, how long, and you were, you were pregnant that time, how log ago was that. 

00:08:25
SHANNON Umm… yeah 20 years ago. 

00:08:30
BOB SCHWARZ 20 years ago, and, okay. And if you think about it now… 

00:08:30
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:35
BOB SCHWARZ Umm… kind of you put yourself back and if you think about that memory, now, how long did that go on for by the way, was it like a one minute thing, or of 10, 20, 30 minutes long kind of… 

00:08:45
SHANNON Oh, you know, I felt like a lot longer than sure it was. 

00:08:50
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. 

00:08:50
SHANNON Now, well, the whole drive umm… the, yeah, it was, it was probably 20 minutes actually, yeah. 

00:09:00
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, so for 20 minutes you were… 

00:09:00
SHANNON He was pretty raged, yeah. 

00:09:00
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, okay. Umm… so if you think about it how much does that bother you now when you kind of think about that event. the val… the R, all zero to ten scale. 

00:09:20
SHANNON Umm… I really get deep into thinking about it, it causes umm… like eight. 

00:09:25
BOB SCHWARZ An eight. 

00:09:25
SHANNON Or nine. 

00:09:25
BOB SCHWARZ Eight, eight or nine. And, you know, we don't want you to go, you know, we don't not interested in, in every reaction or anything so, in the, so we have to make a, a targets, something to make a, a set of statement. So umm… what is it that is, that bothers you about that at this point do you think. I mean when you're thinking about it now and you get and it bothers you. It might not be the same thing as what, what is it that you kind of go. 

00:10:00
SHANNON Umm… the emotions. Umm… well, that I'm out of control that something… 

00:10:05
BOB SCHWARZ That you're out of control, okay. 

00:10:05
SHANNON That I'm going to be killed. 

00:10:05
BOB SCHWARZ That you're going to be killed. 

00:10:10
SHANNON Umm… anger. 

00:10:10
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:10:10
SHANNON For being disrespected. 

00:10:15
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:10:15
SHANNON Umm… and not listen to. 

00:10:20
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. So umm… is there a beginning of this, where does this thing… so we start the, you know, there's a movie of this, you know, because this, this is up, it's okay, up to a point and then all, then something changes where, what, what… 

00:10:35
SHANNON Right, yeah we were going from umm… Anacortes to our cabin in Bellingham. 

00:10:35
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:10:40
SHANNON And I didn't recognize until we were on the, there's a couple different highways, the highway before the freeway.

SHANNON Umm… and I didn't recognize that… 

00:10:50

00:11:05
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:11:05
SHANNON Umm… and that's when I recognized it and then when I confronted it, was when we were merging onto the freeway, umm… I, I've to head up north and that's when he did this swerving and… 

00:11:15
BOB SCHWARZ So where does the suds, where does it start to, where do we start in this movie?

00:11:50
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:11:50
SHANNON I can't do anything about it. 

00:11:50
BOB SCHWARZ All right, that sounds like a good start. 

00:11:55
SHANNON And he's killing me and my baby. 

00:11:55
BOB SCHWARZ And he's killing me and my baby. Okay, so all just that, nothing big. Umm… So let's tap this. So, we're going to activate the side of a hand part and so even though…

SHANNON Even though. 

00:12:15
BOB SCHWARZ Umm… he's driving a 100 miles, you know, you know, whatever, he's drive out of control.

00:12:25
SHANNON And I can't stop him and I am out of control. 

00:12:25
BOB SCHWARZ And he's, seems like he's, he might kill me and my baby. 

00:12:30
SHANNON And he might kill me and my baby. 

00:12:30
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely. 

00:12:35
SHANNON I deeply and completely. 

00:12:35
BOB SCHWARZ Love and accept myself. 

00:12:35
SHANNON Love and accept myself. 

00:12:35
BOB SCHWARZ All right, so keep focusing on that and let's just, you're going to tap the top of your head. So these are all these acupuncture points. So he's, and we're just going to have to say something's to up, keeping us… so, you know, he's driving, he's drunk. 

00:12:50
SHANNON He's driving. He's drunk. 

00:12:50
BOB SCHWARZ Right, he's, he's drunk. You know, out of control I feel out of control. 

00:12:55
SHANNON I feel like out of control. 

00:12:55
BOB SCHWARZ Right, he's… you know, might kill me and my baby. 

00:12:55
SHANNON He might kill me and my baby. 

00:12:55
BOB SCHWARZ Hey, you can do, you can do both sides or one side, it depends, and also you can do the one side 'cause of this thing. Right, right, under your nose, even here. I feel a lot of control. 

00:13:10
SHANNON I feel a lot of control. 

00:13:10
BOB SCHWARZ And here also, I feel disrespected. 

00:13:15
SHANNON I feel disrespected. 

00:13:15
BOB SCHWARZ Right, and here, yeah, okay. So that's one round of this activation All right, so what's up now, what are you aware of, maybe, it maybe the same, it maybe different. Is it still on eight? 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
SHANNON It still pisses me off. 

00:13:40
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, okay. Well, that sounds okay. So, well that sounds is it on eight still or no. 

00:13:50
SHANNON I, I don't know, it's like the feeling or the injustice, the feeling of intensity, right. 

00:13:55
BOB SCHWARZ The feeling is the intensity. 

00:13:55
SHANNON The injustice is always going to be there, right, maybe. Okay. 

00:13:55
BOB SCHWARZ But I don't know, so, that's what you're aware of now. It's the injustice of it and, and being pissed off, that's more in the front, right. 

00:14:05
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:14:05
BOB SCHWARZ So, so… 

00:14:05
SHANNON Yeah it change, it changed from being terrified. 

00:14:10
BOB SCHWARZ Right, so that is exactly, so that's the thing that… in this approach and actually in other approaches I think even Erickson and you want to find out that there, it turns out there's a lot more complication going on in our minds and we don't always pay attention to it, just as a big mismatch, So it was fear, now that's not so present now it's a, it's, it's, it's pissed off, anger, and injustice which is a little different than pissed off. 

00:14:40
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:40
BOB SCHWARZ It's, so what would we say even though the, there's this and… yeah, I'm pissed off at the injustice of it. 

00:14:45
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:45
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, even though… 

00:14:50
SHANNON Even though… 

00:14:50
BOB SCHWARZ I'm pissed off… 

00:14:50
SHANNON I'm pissed off… 

00:14:50
BOB SCHWARZ …at the injustice of this. 

00:14:50

00:17:20
SHANNON I don't know if I have the panicky feeling. 

00:17:20
BOB SCHWARZ You don't feel it. 

00:17:20
SHANNON No. 

00:17:20
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:17:25
SHANNON No, the pissed, got rid of that one. 

00:17:25
BOB SCHWARZ The pissed is gone too. 

00:17:25
SHANNON Umm… yeah. 

00:17:30
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:17:30
SHANNON I, I guess there's not a lot of intensity around it. 

00:17:30
BOB SCHWARZ Right, okay. 

00:17:35
SHANNON Right, kind of like, kind of like what you said earlier, it's like, it's a memory, it's not happening right now, right. 

00:17:40
BOB SCHWARZ No, right. 

00:17:40
SHANNON So that's what it feels like. 

00:17:40
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. That's different. 

00:17:45
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:17:45
BOB SCHWARZ What about the injustice of the sense of oh, this is so, I mean… 

00:17:50
SHANNON Yeah, it's still bullshit he did that. 

00:17:55
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. It's one thing to intellectually know that something is unjust. 

00:17:55
SHANNON Right. 

00:17:55
BOB SCHWARZ It's another thing to, you know, feel of the injustice of it. 

00:18:00
SHANNON I don't want to give him my power anymore, that's what I feel like. 

00:18:05
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, oh. Did it feel like you gave him your power back then? 

00:18:10
SHANNON Maybe, I think I did. 

00:18:10
BOB SCHWARZ Huh! So, let's, let's think about it. So how would you if you think a back that memory what's in the memory, what's going on in this thing that umm… somehow tells you that perhaps you gave him your power. 

00:18:30
SHANNON Because I let it affect me all these years, I just kept getting in the car, and I kept being pissed and nothing, nothing changed. 

00:18:35
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. So… 

00:18:40
SHANNON That's how I feel like I gave him my power. 

00:18:40
BOB SCHWARZ I see, so that's not about the memory anymore that's the… 

00:18:40
SHANNON Why let the memory continue to recreate the same situation I didn't want. 

00:18:45
BOB SCHWARZ I see, right. 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:55
BOB SCHWARZ So, I… sounds like maybe, we might be, it's hard to believe we might be doing this memory now or in the next part, but let's, let's find out. Go back to this memory, so now I wanna, now I wanna, you know, kind of test this. So go back into the memory, and now I want you to see if you can like or you get into the car, you're in the car, you're driving along, you find out oh my God he's drunk. See if you can make and go through this, is there anything left in this memory. I want you to go through it and now I want you to see if you can get upset. 

00:19:25
SHANNON Yeah, get okay. I'll work on it. 

00:19:25
BOB SCHWARZ If you, but if you do let me know. 

00:19:25
SHANNON Okay. 

00:19:25
BOB SCHWARZ So just tell me the story, I want you to tell me the story and if at any point, I'm in the car we do this, we do, you know, tell me what goes on. 

00:19:30
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:35
BOB SCHWARZ And then if you get upset at any point let me know. 

00:19:35
SHANNON Okay. 

00:19:35
BOB SCHWARZ So just tell, say it all out that as if it's happening, I'm doing this, I'm doing this, I'm doing this, or he's doing that, whatever. 

00:19:45
SHANNON Okay, so we're at a friend's house, we're heading back to our cabin and sleep, and we're driving along forget the name of the highway Anacortes highway, whatever. Umm… back towards Mount Vernon and I don't remember if he was like swerving. Umm… or what that was, but he started driving erratically and I told him to knock it off. And then… 

00:20:10
BOB SCHWARZ Any, any, any suds at this point. 

00:20:10
SHANNON Little bit. 

00:20:10
BOB SCHWARZ What, what number would you give it. 

00:20:15
SHANNON Umm… like three. 

00:20:20
BOB SCHWARZ Three? And the suds is what, what's the distress, is the subject of units of distress, so why is it a three. 

00:20:30
SHANNON Okay, I got to go back, so we got on the intercourse highway. And I realized that he's drunk. 

00:20:35
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. 

00:20:40
SHANNON We didn't have anything there, and then we get on the freeway and he starts driving 100 miles an hour. 

00:20:50
BOB SCHWARZ Is that before or after you told him to knock it off. 

00:20:50
SHANNON Well, after. 

00:20:50
BOB SCHWARZ So you just, yeah 'cause you said you are still in… 

00:20:50
SHANNON I told him to knock it off, that's what probably brought the emotion, that is not being heard. 

00:21:00
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:21:00
SHANNON And respected. 

00:21:00
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. So even though I told him the knock it off… 

00:21:05
SHANNON Even though I told him the knock it off… 

00:21:05
BOB SCHWARZ …and I, I wasn't feeling respected, because I wasn't feeling respected and hurt. 

00:21:10
SHANNON …and I wasn't feeling respected and hurt. 

00:21:10
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely… 

00:21:10
SHANNON I deeply and completely… 

00:21:15
BOB SCHWARZ …love and accept myself. 

00:21:15
SHANNON …love and accept myself. 

00:21:15
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, told him to knock it off. 

00:21:20
SHANNON Told him to stop. 

00:21:20
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, he didn't he, he was, he didn't respect me. 

00:21:25
SHANNON Not at all. 

00:21:25
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, he didn't listen to me. 

00:21:25
SHANNON He didn't listen. He didn't take my feelings into consideration. 

00:21:30
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:21:30
SHANNON He didn't respect our daughter. 

00:21:35
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, right. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:45
BOB SCHWARZ Now, while we're doing that you, some of you if you've seen this kind of work before you, you might see people doing all kinds of hypnotic and suggestions or cognitive reframes I'm choosing not to do that. Because this is closer to a, the quote officially EFT you could, but the actual EFT thing is more about removing this negative stuff and we'll all get to the hippo stuff a little later maybe. What, what's up? 

00:22:05
SHANNON The memory changed, I just remembered. 

00:22:10
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, uh-huh. 

00:22:10
SHANNON It was 16 years ago. 

00:22:15
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:22:15
SHANNON Oh I mean 18. 

00:22:15
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:22:15
SHANNON And my oldest daughter was in the back seat in her car seat. And I was pregnant with my second daughter. 

00:22:20
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, wow. Okay, and yeah. I can see that, okay so what's… 

00:22:30
SHANNON Sorry. 

00:22:30
BOB SCHWARZ No, no it's all good, it's all, no, no that's how it goes, that's perfect. Umm… and that might be one of the reasons, why it's hung around for this as long as it has. So what's now what you're aware of, that you weren't aware of before. So you have, I mean, I, I'll tell what I am worried of, you have a lot at stake, all of a sudden, I mean like "holy cow, this is the whole kit and caboodle here." 

00:22:55
SHANNON I think the dog was in the car too, he would kill my whole family. 

00:23:00
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, that was the thing we talked about. 

00:23:00
SHANNON You know, I love my dogs, well, myself and more of course. 

00:23:05
BOB SCHWARZ So even though… 

00:23:05
SHANNON Even though… 

00:23:05
BOB SCHWARZ …I'm scared to death. 

00:23:10
SHANNON …I'm scared to death. 

00:23:10
BOB SCHWARZ I'm going to lose my entire family. 

00:23:10
SHANNON I am gonna lose my entire family. 

00:23:15
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely and it doesn't seem to me a damn thing I can do about it. 

00:23:20
SHANNON And there doesn't seem to be a damn thing I can do about it. 

00:23:20
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely love and accept myself. 

00:23:25
SHANNON I deeply and completely love and accept myself. 

00:23:25
BOB SCHWARZ So, you know, everybody the car, the kid, the dog, the unborn child. 

00:23:30
SHANNON My whole family. 

00:23:30
BOB SCHWARZ I, there's nothing I can do. 

00:23:35
SHANNON I can't do anything, he wont listen. 

00:23:35
BOB SCHWARZ He won't listen, you know, I am right, thank you. 

00:23:40
SHANNON Sure. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
BOB SCHWARZ It's a God damn thing, I wish I could do something. 

00:23:50
SHANNON I knew. 

00:23:50
BOB SCHWARZ Make sure you're getting that collar bone point. There you go, and under the arm. So, what's up now? It's changed yet again a bit. 

00:24:05
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:24:10
BOB SCHWARZ What's up, what are you aware of? 

00:24:10
SHANNON It's less intense. 

00:24:10
BOB SCHWARZ Less intense, I mean in, okay. 

00:24:15
SHANNON I mean I was ready to bawl my head off there for a second, you know, that was better. 

00:24:15
BOB SCHWARZ Good, what number we have now. 

00:24:20
SHANNON I feel more in control. 

00:24:20
BOB SCHWARZ You feel more in control. 

00:24:20
SHANNON Mm-hmm, I don't know y I said that. 

00:24:25
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, so, even though I didn't feel in control then… 

00:24:30
SHANNON Even though I didn't feel in control then… 

00:24:30
BOB SCHWARZ …I feel more control now. 

00:24:35
SHANNON …I feel in control now, more. 

00:24:40
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, even though I didn't feel in control then and maybe that sort of became a bit of an imprint on me, I'm out of control like nothing I can do, is that fair. 

00:24:45
SHANNON That's exactly fair. 

00:24:50
BOB SCHWARZ Even though like I reached that kind of instant conclusion or maybe took 20 minutes, I don't know but I deeply and completely love and accept myself. 

00:25:00
SHANNON I deeply and completely love and accept myself. 

00:25:00
BOB SCHWARZ So I kind of didn't feel in… locked in on this idea that I could, I wasn't in control, nothing I could do. 

00:25:10
SHANNON Right, right. 

00:25:10
BOB SCHWARZ That might not be true anymore. 

00:25:10
SHANNON No, I can be in control now. 

00:25:15
BOB SCHWARZ Right. I didn't feel in control then. 

00:25:20
SHANNON And so much is at stake, so much is at stake. 

00:25:20
BOB SCHWARZ So much was at stake, can't make any mistakes here and back then. 

00:25:25
SHANNON No. 

00:25:30
BOB SCHWARZ No. Right, but that doesn't mean it has to be the same now. 

00:25:35
SHANNON Right. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:45
BOB SCHWARZ You know, they did this umm… I, I, I was at this trauma conference and they did this research apparently, it turns out that uh… in, in the animal kingdom, mammal, mammalian Kingdom including humans that the strategy of essentially not struggling, going with the flow when there's a, a bigger stronger Alpha whatever actually is the best survival strategies statistically. It doesn't play well to movies at all, you know, you don't get any heroines after this or heroes after that. But statistically, so from an evolutionary point of view that's the best play. 

00:26:20
SHANNON Right. 

00:26:25
BOB SCHWARZ Just interesting to note. 

00:26:25
SHANNON Something almost came up. 

00:26:25
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:26:25
SHANNON So I recently umm… one of my clients went saw this healer and so I wanted to check it out and learn about other different genres of healing and, and whatnot and, when I was on the table I had umm… and I'm not woo-hoo, so, but maybe I am now. 

00:26:45
BOB SCHWARZ It's all a matter of perspective, how far into the woo you want to go. 

00:26:50
SHANNON I had umm… three visions. 

00:26:50
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:26:50
SHANNON And the first one where umm… I, it was like during civil war time and umm… my children were being murdered and I was being murdered and I couldn't save them. And the second one was like I don't know, like 680 or something. 

00:27:05
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:27:10
SHANNON Umm… and it was, it was happening again, and they were, I think they were raped and murdered, and so was I, but I watched them die before I was killed, and I've never had visions people I'm just like. 

00:27:20
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:27:20
SHANNON Umm… and then after that, I saw like three golden orbs. And I don't know it just that, there was this really I'm, I'm deathly afraid of dying, I don't really want to die, so… 

00:27:35
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:27:40
SHANNON Umm… so I, I, it kind of gave me a sense of peace that maybe when you're dead and always going to just be dead. 

00:27:45
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm, right. 

00:27:45
SHANNON You know, it's… maybe it's not over. 

00:27:45
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:27:45
SHANNON But when I was thinking about that those really came up because, it's kind of the same theme. And maybe I was just tapping into that too, you know, maybe it was just kind of a, I don't know you know. 

00:28:00
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:28:00
SHANNON But then my umm… I think it's the, it's sadness it's grief. That's what I felt. 

00:28:10
BOB SCHWARZ Grief about, loved one, loved ones, yeah. 

00:28:10
SHANNON Just the whole, whole thing I think is how much I love my, my family. 

00:28:15
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:28:15
SHANNON And that I might lose them. 

00:28:20
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, so even if, they're even though, if we're going to, we're going to do the karma thing. 

00:28:25
SHANNON Okay. 

00:28:25
BOB SCHWARZ Would you wanna do ipso facto, it's revision. 

00:28:25
SHANNON You choose. 

00:28:30
BOB SCHWARZ I don't care, you choose. 

00:28:30
SHANNON Okay. 

00:28:30
BOB SCHWARZ Ipso facto? 

00:28:30
SHANNON I don't know what go is. 

00:28:30
BOB SCHWARZ We're going to talk though, even though like you have, you have that, you know, this Karmic. 

00:28:35
SHANNON We can do even though like that one. 

00:28:35
BOB SCHWARZ All right, so even though… 

00:28:40
SHANNON Even though… 

00:28:40
BOB SCHWARZ …I may have this karmic uh… energy about losing loved ones. 

00:28:45
SHANNON …I may have this karmic energy about losing my loved ones. 

00:28:45
BOB SCHWARZ That's somehow not quite resolved as of yet. 

00:28:50
SHANNON That's somehow not quite resolved as of yet. 

00:28:50
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely… 

00:28:50
SHANNON I deeply and completely… 

00:28:55
BOB SCHWARZ …love and accept myself. 

00:28:55
SHANNON …love and accept myself. 

00:28:55
BOB SCHWARZ All the way back. 

00:29:00
SHANNON All the way back. 

00:29:00
BOB SCHWARZ All the way forward. 

00:29:00
SHANNON All the way forward. 

00:29:05
BOB SCHWARZ So just kind of think about that, just being accepting of this karmic thing that might go all the way back and can, can change moving into the present. And moving forward in time, and that doesn't have to keep repeating. 

00:29:25
SHANNON It doesn't have to keep repeating. 

00:29:25
BOB SCHWARZ It's not required. 

00:29:25
SHANNON No, I don't want it to. 

00:29:30
BOB SCHWARZ I can let that energy go of right now. 

00:29:30
SHANNON I can let that energy go of right now. 

00:29:30
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:40
BOB SCHWARZ What's up now? 

00:29:45
SHANNON That feels better. 

00:29:50
BOB SCHWARZ If you… 

00:29:50
SHANNON There's still some there. 

00:29:50
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, tell me about it. 

00:29:55
SHANNON That's just still some grief. 

00:30:00
BOB SCHWARZ Grief? 

00:30:00
SHANNON Maybe fear. 

00:30:00
BOB SCHWARZ Fear? Yeah, we umm… 

00:30:05
SHANNON No, I think it's more sadness. 

00:30:05
BOB SCHWARZ Sadness, we're still talking through the generations apparently. 

00:30:10
SHANNON Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:10
BOB SCHWARZ Can you put any more words to the sad… where do you feel the sadness. Where in your body do you feel it? 

00:30:15
SHANNON In my heart. 

00:30:15
BOB SCHWARZ In your heart. Okay, and some tears, okay. I am curious is it umm… there's different kind of varieties of sadness. So is this the umm… compassionate kind or the, I don't know the upset kind or you, you know, that the, you know, depressed kind. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:45
SHANNON I don't know, kind of fear based kind, a little bit. 

00:30:45
BOB SCHWARZ Kind of fear the based kind, okay. So even if I still have some of the sadness that's sort of fear based… 

00:30:50
SHANNON Even I have the some of the sadness, yes, fear based… 

00:30:55
BOB SCHWARZ …about losing my family through the, through the, through history or, you know. 

00:31:00
SHANNON …about losing my whole family and not being able to protect my family. 

00:31:05
BOB SCHWARZ And not being able to protect my family. 

00:31:05
SHANNON Not being able to same them. 

00:31:10
BOB SCHWARZ Not being able to save them. So even though I haven't been able to save them, I deeply and completely… 

00:31:15
SHANNON I deeply and completely… 

00:31:15
BOB SCHWARZ …love and accept myself. 

00:31:20
SHANNON …love and accept myself. 

00:31:20
BOB SCHWARZ Let's do that again. 

00:31:20
SHANNON Okay. 

00:31:20
BOB SCHWARZ Even if… 

00:31:25
SHANNON Even if… 

00:31:25
BOB SCHWARZ …I'm sad, and I have the sadness because I haven't been able to save my family. 

00:31:30
SHANNON …I'm sad, because I haven't been able to save or protect my family. 

00:31:30
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely… 

00:31:35
SHANNON I deeply and completely… 

00:31:35
BOB SCHWARZ …love and accept myself. 

00:31:35
SHANNON …love and accept myself. 

00:31:35
BOB SCHWARZ And so will do one more three is the magic number. Even if, even though, yeah whatever. 

00:31:40
SHANNON Even if, even though… 

00:31:45
BOB SCHWARZ I have sad. I have the sadness… 

00:31:45
SHANNON I have a sadness… 

00:31:45
BOB SCHWARZ That I haven't been able to save and protect my family. 

00:31:50
SHANNON That I haven't been able to save and protect my family. 

00:31:50
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely… 

00:31:50
SHANNON I deeply and completely… 

00:31:50
BOB SCHWARZ …love and accept myself. 

00:31:55
SHANNON …love and accept myself. 

00:31:55
BOB SCHWARZ And that includes your dog too, right. 

00:31:55
SHANNON Yeah, my daughter too. 

00:32:00
BOB SCHWARZ Your daughter…. 

00:32:00
SHANNON I don't remember, sorry. 

00:32:00
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, okay, that's another story. 

00:32:00
SHANNON Yup. 

00:32:05
BOB SCHWARZ So let's do it, I haven't been able to save my family. 

00:32:05
SHANNON I haven't been able to protect or save my family. 

00:32:10
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, that seems to be this karmic thing. 

00:32:10
SHANNON It seems to be a karmic thing. 

00:32:15
[sil.] 

00:32:20
BOB SCHWARZ You know, well, let's say this, I haven't been able to save my family, that's the karma, I have this karmic pattern, right. I haven't been able to save my family, save and protect my family. 

00:32:30
SHANNON Protect, yeah… 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:40
BOB SCHWARZ What's up now? 

00:32:45
SHANNON Better, something came up, something happened to my daughter a year ago. 

00:32:55
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. Umm… okay. 

00:33:00
SHANNON I keep bringing them up, I know. 

00:33:00
BOB SCHWARZ Well, it's okay, so here's the thing. 

00:33:00
SHANNON It's not linked I think to that same… 

00:33:00
BOB SCHWARZ Well here's the, yeah it is, it maybe, it may, it may very well be. Umm… but here's the thing, if you, if you believe in, if you accept the karma frame then, then we're all actors on a play right. 

00:33:20
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:33:20
BOB SCHWARZ Because you, if you're, if your karma says I have to uh… I'm working on this, my character does not save and protect my family. Then you need to bring in other characters who have to not be saved you see, you, you follow me and that's the way it has to be because that's, because if, if something has to be their karma too. 

00:33:45
SHANNON Right. 

00:33:50
BOB SCHWARZ So, if your karma changes ipso facto… 

00:33:55
SHANNON Right. 

00:33:55
BOB SCHWARZ …their karma has to sort of adjust to that. 

00:34:00
SHANNON Right, I think, you know, it already has a little bit. 

00:34:00
BOB SCHWARZ It already has, I mean… 

00:34:05
SHANNON I feel like they are going to be okay. 

00:34:05
BOB SCHWARZ They, oh! 

00:34:05
SHANNON Futuristically. 

00:34:10
BOB SCHWARZ Have you really, futuristically, okay. Umm… do you think you've let go of this karma yet. 

00:34:15
SHANNON I hope so. 

00:34:15
BOB SCHWARZ Well, need to maybe today, but maybe up until now, do you, maybe we should do something that even like quite haven't finished letting go of this karma. I mean, I don't know you tell me. 

00:34:25
SHANNON I don't know. I don't know I might have a little bit. 

00:34:30
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, you might have, uh-huh. 

00:34:30
SHANNON But this is all around protecting is what makes me panic. 

00:34:35
BOB SCHWARZ Say more about that. 

00:34:35
SHANNON Well, like my dog, you know. 

00:34:40
BOB SCHWARZ It's your job to protect. 

00:34:40
SHANNON That's right, yeah. So it's, it's, I get some… 

00:34:45
BOB SCHWARZ That's why. 

00:34:45
SHANNON It's bigger… differ… oh yeah. 

00:34:50
BOB SCHWARZ All right. 

00:34:50
SHANNON Yeah, yeah.

BOB SCHWARZ Do you still want that job. 

00:34:55
SHANNON No, I mean more than it, I am a mommy of course. 

00:34:55
BOB SCHWARZ Well, yeah, but, but, you know, the capital "P" protects, yeah. 

00:35:00
SHANNON But I don't want to hold on to it in a way that doesn't really help anybody, I am just gonna freak my Perkins(ph) out. 

00:35:05
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:35:05
SHANNON And my dog, make him have anxiety. It's true. 

00:35:10
BOB SCHWARZ Right, right, right. Umm… so, okay, so how about we just go uh… even though… 

00:35:15
SHANNON Even though… 

00:35:15
BOB SCHWARZ Umm… I've, I've have this, I've, I've, so, you know, I've, I've had this job of protecting… 

00:35:25
SHANNON I've had this job of protecting… 

00:35:25
BOB SCHWARZ …and I'm ready to let it go now. 

00:35:25
SHANNON …and I'm ready to let it go now. 

00:35:30
BOB SCHWARZ I deeply and completely… 

00:35:30
SHANNON I deeply and completely… 

00:35:30
BOB SCHWARZ …love and accept myself. 

00:35:30
SHANNON …love and accept myself. 

00:35:35
BOB SCHWARZ All right, so just, you know, I've had this job a protect, I got to protect. 

00:35:35
SHANNON I have had this job that I got to protect. 

00:35:40
BOB SCHWARZ I'm not and I don't want that job anymore. 

00:35:40
SHANNON I don't want that job anymore. 

00:35:45
BOB SCHWARZ I quit. 

00:35:45
SHANNON I quit. 

00:35:50
BOB SCHWARZ There is no need for protection. 

00:35:50
SHANNON No. Now they're going to be okay. 

00:35:55
BOB SCHWARZ These aren't the troubles, that you're looking for. 

00:36:00
SHANNON No. I don't want to let it continue to affect me. 

00:36:00
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:36:05
SHANNON It kind of pisses me off. 

00:36:05
BOB SCHWARZ It kind of pisses you off. 

00:36:05
SHANNON Little bit. 

00:36:05
BOB SCHWARZ What do you mean? 

00:36:10
SHANNON That it did. 

00:36:10
BOB SCHWARZ What? 

00:36:10
SHANNON That I, it took lot of years. 

00:36:10
BOB SCHWARZ To… 

00:36:15
SHANNON For me, being panicky. 

00:36:20
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, well. 

00:36:20
SHANNON I wanted to kick it. 

00:36:20
BOB SCHWARZ You want to kick it, I don't know if you hung out at all with doubts and all, but you don't, you don't wanna really kill things, you know, it's like, It's okay, it took you this, you know, Karma works as a work. So it got this long, can you, and it's pretty natural like if you've done something for a long time and you finally do something different, I call it, I call it the VA response, you know, I sort of had a VA and it's a really, it's really intense response and nobody knows about it. I'm the only person that talks about I'm aware of and umm… here's the thing you need to kind of get umm… okay with it, because it's part of the healing process, it's like itching. 

00:37:00
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:37:00
BOB SCHWARZ When you're healing, like you want the edge. 

00:37:05
SHANNON Kind of like, been there done that. 

00:37:05
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, I've been there done that, and it's okay that I'm feeling kind of like, "oh God, I should have had VA," well, yeah, but I forgot, but I, but it's okay now. Like I'm going to have a little of this remorse, it comes that's part of the healing process, don't, it's painful but it's okay. Will that be, is that fair. 

00:37:20
SHANNON Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:25
BOB SCHWARZ So just that this is, you know, even if I have a little of that VA response. 

00:37:25
SHANNON Even if I have a little of that VA response. 

00:37:30
BOB SCHWARZ It's not that… it's part of the healing process. 

00:37:30
SHANNON Part of old deal. 

00:37:30
BOB SCHWARZ And I can accept myself. 

00:37:35
SHANNON And I can accept myself. 

00:37:35
BOB SCHWARZ With love… 

00:37:35
SHANNON with love… 

00:37:35
BOB SCHWARZ And appreciation. 

00:37:35
SHANNON And appreciation. 

00:37:35
BOB SCHWARZ So even if I have a little… 

00:37:40
SHANNON Even if I have a little… 

00:37:40
BOB SCHWARZ You know, VA response. 

00:37:40
SHANNON VA response. 

00:37:40
BOB SCHWARZ Little remorse I should have done it. 

00:37:45
SHANNON Little remorse… 

00:37:45
BOB SCHWARZ I wish it was sooner, hey, at least I got it done now. 

00:37:50
SHANNON Atleast got it done now. 

00:37:50
BOB SCHWARZ That feels pretty good, yeah. Some people wait and actually I didn't get it right for the last few lifetimes, so I finally got it, yayee… me… 

00:38:00
SHANNON Excellent point. No more. 

00:38:05
BOB SCHWARZ No more, we're done. And not just, not, not just, no more in your lifetime. 

00:38:10
SHANNON Right, yeah. 

00:38:10
BOB SCHWARZ The next, the next use. 

00:38:10
SHANNON There you go.

00:38:10
SHANNON And for them too maybe. 

00:38:15

00:38:15
SHANNON The whole change is the whole thing, right, like you said.

SHANNON Yeah. 

00:38:25

00:38:40
BOB SCHWARZ To the airport, wherever, you know, Washington. Umm just imagine you are driving in the car and, and… 

00:38:45

00:38:45
BOB SCHWARZ You are the passenger and, you know, 

00:38:50

00:38:50
BOB SCHWARZ No, no. How does that feel? 

00:38:55
SHANNON It feels okay. 

00:38:55
BOB SCHWARZ Is that different? 

00:39:00
SHANNON Yeah. I still feel a little heavy in my chest. 

00:39:00
BOB SCHWARZ Oh. 

00:39:00
SHANNON I don't know why. 

00:39:05
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. Can you just focus your attention on that a little bit and see what comes up? 

00:39:05
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:20
SHANNON I don't know. 

00:39:20

00:39:25
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:39:25
BOB SCHWARZ Is it cold, warm, constricted. 

00:39:30
SHANNON It's warm 

00:39:30
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, it's warm. 

00:39:35
SHANNON Maybe it's because I'm hot. 

00:39:35
BOB SCHWARZ I don't know. Umm… 

00:39:40
[sil.] 

00:39:45
BOB SCHWARZ Just go into that a little more, see if you can see for that a little more, this, your drive, the, where you're driving the car with Jim and you have this, you said you have felt this little warm heaviness in your chest. 

00:39:55
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:00
BOB SCHWARZ Anything come to mind, does it, is it, does it, is it a negative feel, like it doesn't feel good or feels good or it's just interesting or… 

00:40:10
SHANNON I don't know. I mean… 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:20
SHANNON Yeah, I, just said to myself, let, let go the control. 

00:40:25
BOB SCHWARZ Let go of the control. 

00:40:25
SHANNON You can't control that. 

00:40:30
BOB SCHWARZ Control what. 

00:40:30
SHANNON Somebody else is driving or somebody else's car. 

00:40:30
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. 

00:40:30
SHANNON And it'll be all right. Sometimes people get hit. 

00:40:40
BOB SCHWARZ True. 

00:40:40
SHANNON Me panicking isn't gonna help anybody. 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:50
BOB SCHWARZ You said something to me I think before when we were talking that sometimes you actually kind of pretend, you close your eyes or you kind of like try to… 

00:40:55
SHANNON Play with my phone. 

00:41:00
BOB SCHWARZ You, you try to not look. 

00:41:00
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:41:00
BOB SCHWARZ Kind of as the opposite of overlooking. 

00:41:05
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:05
BOB SCHWARZ What about some middle ground, what about, you know, being comfortable and if for some reason somebody's, you know, cars swerving across the double yellow line or doing something really stupid or whatever. You go, "excuse me umm… you know, you're heading across the, you know, watch out or so." 

00:41:25
SHANNON Oh, I do. 

00:41:25
BOB SCHWARZ But do you ever do it calmly? 

00:41:25
SHANNON Do I. No. 

00:41:30
BOB SCHWARZ Can you imagine doing it calmly. 

00:41:35
SHANNON I, I can. Can you imagine me doing it calmly. 

00:41:40
BOB SCHWARZ So you can. Can you uh… visualize that on your mind like, this, I don't know if, I don't know what happens with this. 

00:41:45
SHANNON Please, please don't swerve into the other lane, right. 

00:41:45
BOB SCHWARZ Well, it would depend. 

00:41:50
SHANNON Can you stay in just one lane. 

00:41:55
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. Now we're talking to Jim, we're talking to this other guy who just… 

00:41:55
SHANNON I'm talking to Jim. 

00:41:55
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. 

00:42:00
SHANNON He's, he likes to switch lanes a lot. 

00:42:00
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, okay. So what if you said like, "hey I'm tend to be, you know, I'm more comfortable. 

00:42:10
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:42:10
BOB SCHWARZ If you kind of sty in one lane, it's not about you, it's just me, would you do me a favor. 

00:42:15
SHANNON Sure. 

00:42:20
BOB SCHWARZ Do you ever talk like that? 

00:42:20
SHANNON Umm… probably not, no, not… 

00:42:25
BOB SCHWARZ Could, could you imagine talking like that. 

00:42:25
SHANNON I mean I do in my working stuff. 

00:42:25
BOB SCHWARZ No, no, no I mean in this context, right. Oh, well, that's okay. It's excellent, right, so you can talk like that in, in work, right. 

00:42:35
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:42:35
BOB SCHWARZ So if we take her. 

00:42:35
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:42:40
BOB SCHWARZ And that part of you and bring it into the seat of the car. 

00:42:45
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:42:45
BOB SCHWARZ And maybe… 

00:42:45
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:42:50
BOB SCHWARZ And if you need to say something to someone like Jim can you just imagine doing that. 

00:42:55
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:42:55
BOB SCHWARZ How does that feel? 

00:42:55
SHANNON Well, I, I, that feels… that makes sense. 

00:43:00
BOB SCHWARZ I understand it makes sense, how does it feel? Does it feel good, does it feel strong, does it feel, does it make you… 

00:43:05
SHANNON Yeah, it feels good. 

00:43:10
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, close your eyes for a second. Just kind of go into that. 

00:43:15
SHANNON Am I in the car with Jim? 

00:43:15
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:43:15
SHANNON Okay. 

00:43:15
BOB SCHWARZ And umm… 

00:43:15
SHANNON We have to top down? Okay, got it. 

00:43:20
BOB SCHWARZ You have to top down whatever, yeah. And you're saying to him, "hey, I would appreciate it if, you know, I just, you know, I'll be a lot more comfortable and… 

00:43:30
SHANNON Hey, I'd appreciate it if, I'll be a lot more comfortable. 

00:43:35
BOB SCHWARZ If you stayed in one lane, yeah. 

00:43:35
SHANNON If you stayed in one lane and followed my most excellent directions. 

00:43:45
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh, and… I'm getting a fuller picture here. And, and, and, umm… and then, well, how does that feel can you do that… keep your eyes closed again, good, and can you imagine being comfortable in the car. 

00:44:00
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:44:00
BOB SCHWARZ And not feeling that you need to control or that you have to protect or… 

00:44:05
SHANNON Yeah I could see, see that backward. 

00:44:05
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, okay, you know, we're going… I got that. 

00:44:10
SHANNON I keep opening my eyes. 

00:44:15
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, you can open your eyes, all right, so that feels pretty good. 

00:44:15
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:44:15
BOB SCHWARZ What would you say on a scale of zero to ten? Zero is no chance in hell of you actually doing that, ten is it's a done deal. Five is in the middle. 

00:44:25
SHANNON That I won't be panicking. 

00:44:25
BOB SCHWARZ That, that you would, that you, you won't feel panic and be you'll, you'll say something like that if you, you know, just to because that's how you like to be. 

00:44:35
SHANNON Well, 100% I'll do it because I follow directions. 

00:44:40
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, okay, good. 

00:44:40
SHANNON Thank you. Umm… 

00:44:45
BOB SCHWARZ And then you have to see whether you're… what, what's your sense of… 

00:44:45
SHANNON It will just work out. 

00:44:50
BOB SCHWARZ Okay, uh… so this other situation. 

00:44:55
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:00
BOB SCHWARZ Umm… anything come to mind as you imagine the other context where this shows up this problem. You've done some things. You've done some work. Umm… at this moment in time does anything come to mind about how you might handle it in the future starting from when you get home. 

00:45:25
SHANNON Mm-hmm. Yes, show this to my husband. 

00:45:25
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, okay. That's one option, all right. 

00:45:30
SHANNON Or just talk to him about it. 

00:45:30
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:45:35
SHANNON When we're not in the car. 

00:45:35
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:45:35
SHANNON When he's happy. 

00:45:40
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, good. 

00:45:40
SHANNON Like not like in those, like we're busy rushing out the door something like that, you know, just in a calm. 

00:45:45
BOB SCHWARZ Right, right, right. 

00:45:45
SHANNON Just sit down and just talk. 

00:45:45
BOB SCHWARZ Right. 

00:45:45
SHANNON See if you can be more, more mindful. 

00:45:50
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. Does, does he have… 

00:45:50
SHANNON And if he can't then I will just drive. 

00:45:50
BOB SCHWARZ Does he have the capacity to, to be mindful at times. I mean to be respectful at times, now when he is… 

00:45:55
SHANNON Oh, absolutely, yeah, he's got, he's got all kinds… 

00:46:00
BOB SCHWARZ So now when he, yeah, yeah, so now when he is at, now when he is, you know, umm… torqued(ph) and, you know, emotionally, you know, it can grow I mean, you know, I'm not always reasonable like in their times. 

00:46:10
SHANNON Yeah. Oh, I am not either. Some times I may stink on the road. Well, it doesn't bother me. 

00:46:15
BOB SCHWARZ Once in a while, right, right so you don't, right so you don't want to talk to me that, right. 

00:46:20
SHANNON I don't get mad at myself. 

00:46:20
BOB SCHWARZ What, you are what on the road? 

00:46:25
SHANNON I get a little spicy. 

00:46:25
BOB SCHWARZ Do you. 

00:46:25
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:46:25
BOB SCHWARZ Really? 

00:46:25
SHANNON Yeah, I'm a little aggressive. Have you been to Seattle? 

00:46:30
BOB SCHWARZ Not, not, not, not. 

00:46:35
SHANNON Traffic sucks. You got to be a little aggressive. 

00:46:40
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, if, if somebody, if you were in the car with you when you're driving that way would you be freaking out? 

00:46:45
SHANNON Yes. 

00:46:45
BOB SCHWARZ That's interesting. 

00:46:50
SHANNON I know, double stranded horn(ph) 

00:46:50
BOB SCHWARZ Well, you know, there's the old saying of be the change in the world that you want. 

00:46:55
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:46:55
BOB SCHWARZ So… 

00:46:55
SHANNON Because I know it's okay to be a little aggressive. 

00:47:00
BOB SCHWARZ A little aggressive, whatever that means is one thing. But, but if you were linked for this way if someone that, you know, with somebody who just maybe was a little bit, you know, drove in Iowa or something. Umm… and they were in your car will they be all bent out of shape, because of a holy count on man. 

00:47:20
SHANNON Oh, yeah. Yeah if I was, yeah. 

00:47:20
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. 

00:47:20
SHANNON If I was late. 

00:47:20
BOB SCHWARZ Is that really required? 

00:47:25
SHANNON Because I do a changes things a lot too. But I might scare myself because I'm in control. 

00:47:35
BOB SCHWARZ Mm… 

00:47:35
SHANNON But if someone else is in my car, I don't drive that way. 

00:47:40
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, I see you just do it for yourself. 

00:47:45
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:47:45
BOB SCHWARZ Seems a little problematic from… 

00:47:50
SHANNON Maybe sometimes, if someone is in the car but very much. 

00:47:50
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. 

00:47:50
SHANNON Nah, I'm usually pretty much chilled. 

00:47:55
BOB SCHWARZ Can you imagine making a pact with your husband and say, "look, can we both work on, you know, being more driving, you know, first of all there's other people on the road too. 

00:48:05
SHANNON I really like that I own that actually. I think he'd really appreciate that. 

00:48:10
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, he might because, you know, like, you know, there's so, you know, like this you're going to, "hey, what do you drive like a maniac for," and he's like make me. Look at you, because he because, you're, because you're saying I don't trust you. 

00:48:25
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:48:25
BOB SCHWARZ And that doesn't usually feel good, and you may have good reason but what if you both say look it's always easier when the, you know, we're doing it, but the other guy is like, you know, maybe it's time to make a deal, say we all need to be umm… more, you know, grounded and less activating all this stuff and it would be better for everybody. And God knows who else is in the car, and family members and like you're going to be sober, you got to be sober all the time. This is, you could turn this into a sort of not that, well, you mentioned drinking earlier. So, you know, sobriety is not just about not umm… drinking or taking a substance, it's, it's being grounded and sober and… what does, how does that scene with, with that. 

00:49:10
SHANNON It sounds good. 

00:49:10
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah. 

00:49:10
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:49:10
BOB SCHWARZ What do you think he might respond to that? 

00:49:15
SHANNON Yeah, yeah, I actually have been working on it, I listen to Ted talks while I drive. 

00:49:15
BOB SCHWARZ Uh-huh. 

00:49:20
SHANNON So that I don't my… my brain's, you know, learning. So I hope so. 

00:49:25
BOB SCHWARZ So I wonder if you can imagine, close your eyes again and, and take what we been doing and imagine having this conversation. Not when you're driving with your husband about how you would like, about how this incident, how this thing has gotten between you I shall, we shall imagine it has. 

00:49:45
SHANNON Little bit. 

00:49:50
BOB SCHWARZ And how you would like it to be different and that you realize that you have a, you haven't been completely fair… 

00:49:55
SHANNON True. 

00:49:55
BOB SCHWARZ …and some of this your stuff and some of it's his stuff and you would like to move, you know, it's different direction where you really want everybody to drive. You know, you want to be the, you want to become, maybe this is an exaggeration, the poster child, the poster husband and wife, for umm… safe driving Seattle or something, you know, like we're not going to be the… 

00:50:25
SHANNON That's funny. 

00:50:25
BOB SCHWARZ I realize it's probably too much but you know what I'm saying in that, you want to move in that direction right. 

00:50:30
SHANNON Right. 

00:50:35
BOB SCHWARZ And see, notice how he in your, in your, in this little imagination how he responds and he was, he'd like that and how you respond to him and then how he responds to you. 

00:50:45
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
BOB SCHWARZ And then go a little further and imagine that in fact does, does this seem like he would agree to, and imagine that you've somehow come together and work this out that you'll come, maybe come up with a cue for each other or just have this pact. And then keep projecting how this unfolds in time over a week, over a month, may be over six months and how the, this harmony and the driving and they are letting go of this karmic thing and kind of creating a new future unfolds for you. I have no idea what that looks like or feels like but I suspect it's probably pretty good. 

00:51:45
SHANNON That will be really nice, it's gonna be nice. 

00:51:50
BOB SCHWARZ And do you think he would think it's nice. 

00:51:50
SHANNON Oh, yeah, yeah. He's gonna especially love that I own my responsibility. 

00:51:55
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, so if he shows, if you, if you show him this tape he's going to love this part right. 

00:52:05
SHANNON Oh yeah, yeah. I might not show him, I might just talk to him. 

00:52:10
BOB SCHWARZ Okay. That's fine, but if he did see this… 

00:52:10
SHANNON And I want him to feel exposed. 

00:52:15
BOB SCHWARZ Yeah, but if he did see this part he'd like the fact, yeah. 

00:52:15
SHANNON He would really like the part, yeah. He'll be like, yes! 

00:52:20
BOB SCHWARZ And that would motivate him, would it not to actually perhaps give you what you want. 

00:52:25
SHANNON Yeah. 

00:52:30
[sil.] 

00:52:35
SHANNON That’s I would… sol… solve a lot of problems. 

00:52:40
BOB SCHWARZ Mm-hmm. And I would imagine that, that perhaps might be a model for some of those other situations that you referred to. 

00:52:50
SHANNON Mm-hmm. Yeah, great. 

00:52:55
BOB SCHWARZ So just let that kind of, thinking about that let that sink in, you can let your unconscious mind spread that out like a seed. And, you know, through time, through energy. 

00:53:15
[sil.] 

00:53:20
BOB SCHWARZ And it might really ring true that this is the time for this to be different moving forward in time perhaps for all time. 

00:53:40
SHANNON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:40
BOB SCHWARZ And umm… I'm not sure what time it is but I got it's got to be close it's time, so come on back. Umm… I don't know if we even have any time to do anything but thank you very much. 

00:53:55
SHANNON Thank you. 

00:53:55
BOB SCHWARZ Oh, my pleasure. Uh… we have… right, we're done, right, yeah, yeah great. Okay, great, right, thanks. 

00:54:00
SHANNON Great, thank you.
