Marriage 

00:00:05
2000 

00:00:25
JAY HALEY There's just too much variety for, for the standard way of working, but there are. You know, what you're going so you can have a young college couple married and commit of being equal about everything. And after them come in a Middle Eastern couple who husband won't even sit down with the wife. So what's your ideal marriage? It can only be a cultural bias based on where you marry. But there's no clear code. There's not even a clear code on how to get them behave. There was a period of conflict free marriage therapy. You, you were getting rid of all con-, conflict. Then there was uh, a period where uh, conflict was healthy and you encouraged conflict. You got them angry with each other. It seems that when an ideal marriage should be depends on when you went to graduate school. I was stuck with it at times and culture and so on. But there's so many kinds, let's see. Differences in class and in age. There's homosexual marriages, there's nomadic marriages. There's arranged marriages, there's separated marriages where they separate but live in the same house. There's multiple marriages of divorce and there's also a difference in marriage therapy depending how they came. If they come with a product after a problem child has been improved. It's very different than if they come in with an affair or with some other problem. But they're under the same situation that you uh, each case has to be treated on its own merits. You have to make a theory for each case and a therapy for each case. So uh, the result is a lack of focus really. 

00:02:40
[sil.] 

00:02:40
JAY HALEY One of the things that I think I bought and shouldn't have. Back in the 50s where everything happened there was this idea at that time that couples had a theme. They uh, there were rules they followed. And that these rules they had to follow. Once they had a rule they were stuck with it. It would even start with courtship and would then continue into old age really, unless the therapist interfered. Well, some, some of these rules are not so pleasant. But for example, one of the rules could be uh, that the husband is irresponsible and the wife is responsible. 

00:03:25
Rules of Relationships 

00:03:30
JAY HALEY And whatever they'll do that's what they'll do. If there's a question coming into therapy the wife will want to come in to therapy. She's responsible. The husband won't want to come in to therapy, it's a waste of time. Whatever they do it's that way. That uh, he spends the money recklessly and irresponsibly. She saves money more than they need. When she's got a duty, the more responsible he is, I mean more irresponsible he is the more responsible she has to be. So that the system creates itself really. You can make people aware of it. You can say, "Have you noticed your husband is irresponsible?" Oh, I guess you couldn't say that. You can say, "I expected your husband to be more responsible." And she says, "Will you, what's expect for nothing because he's irresponsible." He won't ever do what I want. And he'll say, "Well, she never wants to enjoy herself in life." So, that's the, that's their theme or their rule. And uh, they have to do it. And when they come in and you try to change that you're, you're up against a very tight rule. Also you want to hear that uh, is this kind of a problem. This is one of the common one. That the uh, the wife initiates what happens and the husband responds. So that uh, he never initiates anything and she never waits for him to respond. I mean she initiates. And uh, they, they can't get out of that. Often a woman will court the man and marry and take all the actions because she initiates whatever happens. Then he uh, responds to her. But after they're married she wants him to initiate something. She doesn't want to just sit around waiting for him to do something, with him doing nothing. So, she pushes him to initiate. He gets mad because that's not the contract, he's suppose to respond. He's not suppose to initiate. So then you have a problem how do you change this. I mean a lot of couples don't mind that. But you do get couples that don't like it and want to change and then you're gonna get this problem. Because these are like railroad tracks once a couple is on it they're on it. And you can point it out, you can shift it, you can give task but it's a difficult to change. 

00:06:10
Don Jackson, MD mapping couples 

00:06:10
JAY HALEY I think it's one of the more interesting things that Don Jackson developed well in our Basic Project. When we were working we, we thought we could map out couples in terms of rules. That we could explain everything they do in terms of rules. And we didn't get that far. I still haven't got that far. But I can still recognize a rule when I see one. There's another issue with it that I just remembered. If you have a woman who initiates and a husband responds and you treat them equally, and you side with each one, you side with her and you side with him. 

00:06:50
How to be Unfair 

00:06:50
JAY HALEY You're confirming that relationship. That she's suppose to initiate and he respond. You're confirming it that by mirrored participation. An uh, that's a problem because you don't want to confirm that. But at the same time you don't want to be unfair and side with one against the other. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:07:10
JAY HALEY If it were a traditional marriage therapy. Actually what I, I don't think it produces change in marriages without siding with one against the other. Not necessarily inadvertently but on purpose. Which is what I'll show here. But it's situation where uh, you don't want to reinforce the very thing you're trying to change. And you're doing that if you're siding with each one equally. You're saying the way you behave is correct, the way you behave is correct. And you don't want to do that I don't think. But let me show you, this is a young couple, very bright who uh, are professionals, married about seven years. They came in on the issue of whether to separate or not. And uh, they were seen for one session I believe. And uh, did a general discussion and we saw them each alone for awhile. Didn't get that information. And then this tape I'm gonna show is the second interview and they come in and they talk at length. And I'll stop and go as we go through this. But uh, the problem they come up with is whether to separate and the therapist has to help them make this decision. And they're a nice young couple, it would be a shame if they separated. But they're in a state with each other and they're in a state because as he says, "She initiated what happened between them." He was fine and now he just doesn't do anything he just responds and she doesn't want that. But let's give it a try. If we can have the lights. 

00:09:00
Second Interview 

00:09:00
Whether Couple Should Separate 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN You, you should have it very clear in your mind as to whether this is gonna get better or worse. Right now you're locked, you're, you're stuck. And, and I think you need to take time. There's no panic about this, this has been going on for awhile; changes you're going through, changes in your career, changes in your life. You're going into your 30s pretty soon. I, I must say what I heard tonight Stephen, you are endanger of losing your wife. I think that what you're doing is absolutely wrong. I think you're making a mess of things, that you're pouting. That you're doing things to turn her off by not talking to her, by not being aggressive, by not seeking her out, by not, not courting her. I think you need to go back to your romance. 

00:09:45
From "Unbalancing a Couple" (enacted) 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Maybe, maybe she did the courting. I think now maybe it's time you start courting her and, and you're driving her away. I think working those long hours, not spending time with you, not, not communicating with you. If I had to make a choice right now I would have to say that you're absolutely wrong. It's your fault and, and you got to do the things if you want this woman as your wife. Because you're putting all the blame on name. You really have to take responsibility for this. And this is a good time of year because it's Spring and the sap is rising. It's, it's the beginning of new life, new, new beginnings. This is the time for you to really convince yourself if you really want to win her you really have to make it very clear in your mind that, that you've done everything you can to win this woman as your wife. It, it's like a second marriage. No fault of yours. I'm gonna put the responsibility on you. I know you won't like what I'm saying it's, it's a hard message I'm leaving you. And, and I don't see that anything Charlene is doing is contributing to it at all. Uh, I just I think that it's not the case. 

00:10:55
CHARLENE I must be doing something. 

00:11:00
STEPHEN Let's talk about this. I think you're bullshit. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN Well, you really have to go after her. You have to court her, you really do. 

00:11:05
STEPHEN She spends her time telling me that everything I am and everything I do is bad, is evil. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN To convince her that it's not you have to convince her that by courting her, by, by going after her. By calling her during the day. 

00:11:20
STEPHEN I call her during the day. It, I can't get through. She never is available to answer the phone, she's always busy. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Take time off and meet her for lunch don't wait, go after her. Uh, don't let her out of your sight. She's a prize possession. If this is the greatest thing in your life, better than margarine then she's going to melt. She's going to disappear. Now you have to take the offensive and, and be aggressive and don't fold under her criticism. She's just giving you a hard time. 

00:11:50
STEPHEN Her criticism isn't just, I don't like you when you do that and I'm going out. I'm leaving. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN Go with her. 

00:12:00
STEPHEN She, I'm not invited. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN Well, you don't have to have, wait for an invitation, you're the man of the house. 

00:12:05
STEPHEN She's never home. She comes home 8:30, 9:00 every night. I'm the first one home every night, what do I do. 

00:12:10
JAY HALEY When one absolves the wife all blame she must come forward because she knows that's not true. While on the telephone the supervisor suggest to therapist to ask for specific behavior and not have an abstract discussion. 

00:12:20
STEPHEN It's a fairly bold statement after one hour. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Well, by tomorrow what will you do so that Charlene does not slip through your fingers? So that she is not moving away from you? What can you do tomorrow? 

00:12:35
STEPHEN Give up everything I believe in. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Or you can modify it. 

00:12:40
STEPHEN I won't do that. 

00:12:40
JAY HALEY In this extreme approach if the husband criticizes the wife the therapist must say he doesn't agree with that and such criticism is being rude to his wife. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Well, that's not the type of person your wife is. I mean it's almost uh, as if you're being rude to her. And I mean if you would just ask her the who, what, where, why, just to get the facts. Your wife would not be offended. 

00:13:05
STEPHEN But I do. I know everything about her job. I know the names of the employees, I know what they do. 

00:13:10
JAY HALEY One risk of this extreme approach is that the husband must act or leave the marriage. When the husband gets thoughtful here he seems to be deciding whether he wants the marriage. The wife becomes nervous worrying about what he'll decide. The therapist goes on pushing. The therapist ignores the resistance of the husband and proceeds as if there's an agreement on a plan. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN You have the task Stephen of courting Charlene for the next two weeks. I want you to be as imaginative and creative as you possibly can be. Don't wait to be asked, don't wait for her to make the first move as she's done here several times tonight. You have to become the initiator for the next two weeks. Then we'll see what happens. What will prevent it from, from not working, Stephen? 

00:13:55
STEPHEN That I won't do that. I won't want to. 

00:13:55
Two Weeks Later 

00:13:55
STEPHEN I think I was pretty good at doing the things that I was suppose to do. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Precisely what was it that you did? I know that you're doing some neat things. 

00:14:00
STEPHEN I don't think I did anything wild and crazy. Uh, there weren't any horses in the house or circus but um, we went out to lunch once. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN And you arranged that? 

00:14:10
STEPHEN Yeah. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN You didn't wait for Charlene to, to do so. You set it up yourself? 

00:14:15
STEPHEN I took her to a restaurant, everything. It was a very nice restaurant. 

00:14:20
CHARLENE It was very nice. 

00:14:20
STEPHEN I sent her flowers after we had a fight on Sunday. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN What, what kind of flowers, roses? 

00:14:25
STEPHEN No, they were Spring flowers. 

00:14:25
CHARLENE They were beautiful. 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN Cut Spring flowers, you like cut Spring flowers. 

00:14:30
CHARLENE I do, I like cut Spring flowers. 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN He has, he has some work to do yet. But he's done a lot of good things. 

00:14:35
CHARLENE He had to have the money. 

00:14:40
The Couple had Two More Sessions and Decided to Stay Together 

00:14:40
They were Past this Stage 

00:14:40
JAY HALEY I wasn't the one that supervised this case but as I understand it they only had two or three sessions and then decided to could do it on their own. They were past this stage whatever that stage was. So, any impressions, issues, comments? Well, let me uh, show you something else to, to solve a problem. When a couple comes to you, usually the night before his wife has been outlining in her head everything to displease her husband. And the husband has been outlining everything against the wife. So they come in really prepared to go after each other. And they don't want to be nice about it. And the question is; how, how to prevent a really limited beginning where they blowup, where you could blow the whole therapy in the first session if they're angry enough. Well it's uh, it's a question of how to do it. And I thought I'd show you, there's a therapist. I'll get you there never mind. I'm gonna show you. This starts with a couple I'm about to show, they come in with a problem and he does what he does here without any preliminaries. He doesn't take a history, he doesn't ask them about their problems. When they sit down he sits down, and that's what I'm gonna show you. I think it's an interesting way to do it. Cue those lights. 

00:16:15
Neil P. Schiff, PhD 

00:16:15
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD You strike me as people that are quite intelligent. And I would like to do something that uh, I wouldn't ordinarily do with uh, anyone. I'm not sure you can do it but uh, let's give it a shot and see whether it uh, see whether you can. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:16:35
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD Okay. Uh, today is June 3rd, it's Friday and uh, it's warm outside but it's not, not tremendously hot the way it will be probably three weeks from now. Right? 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Getting rain on the weekends. 

00:16:55
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD And uh, a month from now, five weeks from now it's gonna be very hot. You know you get the feeling you walk outside, you feel like you've just been hit with uh, well you, you walk into a steam room. And I don't know whether you would agree with this but many times people find heat kind of hallucinogenic. You know, you're not even (crosstalk). Uh. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN You're talking about sun there with the mist on the sand. 

00:17:20
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD Yeah, you know how it is in the summer the sun is so bright and it's so hot and uh, you make yourself comfortable. Would you like to take your coat off? 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN I'm fine. 

00:17:30
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD Okay. Anyway, um, so months from now it will be hot. And uh, two months from now it'll be hot still. Three months from now they're going to be a couple of days when there are intimations of Fall in the air. There's, when you wake up in the morning there'll be a certain uh, Christmas, crispness in the air, right. I mean you can smell it in the mornings. And you won't, they won't be all that tremendous humidity. And Summer will seem like a dream. However, there'll only be one day like that, maybe two. Then it will be tremendously hot again, right. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:18:15
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD And uh, you sort of feel like you're back in this kind of dreamy, hot environment. And then we'll be into October, and, and weather will start to break for sure. So, what I'd like you to do is imagine that uh, it is October. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Mmm. 

00:18:40
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD And rather than being our first meeting that this is our last meeting. And that you have succeeded in solving the problem which you came here for. 

00:18:55
Husband: The following things would be different. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN Well, for one thing, things would be different. 

00:19:05
JAY HALEY He got that done in two sessions. Which was a very different opening because it, it was uh, an intervention on how the problems were solved already. It was interesting. I, I think it helps if you think up things to do. When you difficult problems like two coup-, members of a couple so angry with each other. To look for some way to bring, bring that out uh, in a different way. And this is just a way of trying which I thought was nice. It shows up with them because he opens with they're such an intelligent pair. What I did was stop and show that while I was in the middle of talking with my directives. And it went on kind of long on he did it. And these are two nice examples of giving directives. Both of them pretty straightforward. 

00:19:55
Straightforward Directives 

00:19:55
Giving Advice 

00:20:00
JAY HALEY Straightforward directives there's three or four of them. There is for example um, giving advice. It's straightforward enough. Use to be giving advice or any if the patient asked for advice the therapist would say, "I wonder why you asked for that." 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY They wouldn't have any advice. But nowadays I think it's okay. In fact, I was just remembering I said this awhile ago. What uh, what you have is days. As young people they can't believe their parents or their grandparents because things have changed so fast that they are there. So they look for a contemporary answer. And uh, they can believe that. I know we had a case come in once, it was a couple with a little kid who was 2-years old I think. And the couple wanted to know if the therapist thought that the son was uh, intellectually prepared for nursery school. And uh, as the therapist behaved rather well I thought. She examined the kid with them, without them. She discussed with the kids behavior, she concluded he was ready for nursery school. What it was really it seemed to me is that the uh, the mother and father couldn't go to their parents and ask a simple questions like that. They wouldn't, they wouldn't believe their parents or their grandmother. Which is the traditional way. But that's assuming parents become wiser over a long period of time I think. But now the kids are teaching them how to work a computer far less the parents having a lot of easy advice. 

00:22:00
Coaching 

00:22:00
JAY HALEY There's another uh, straightforward directive and that's coaching. When you're showing somebody and doing something with somebody else. I think you coach a wife to get, win back her husband or coach a husband to win back a wife. Or even coach an adolescent to get on better with his parents. It's just a matter of setting up a mode and then guiding them with it, and anticipate what, what's going to be a change. But that's a straightforward directive, it isn't tricky at all. 

00:22:35
Ordeals 

00:22:35
Ordeals Therapy (1984/2011) 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY There's another subtle directives and that is ordeals. There's a very good book on that. It has a theory, case and everything. It's called, "What do you think". An ordeal is when, when you do something that's hard around you then something, then you'll give up the something. It's a uh, a very simple idea. You see a person or a family and you talk to them about their problems and then you set it up that every time they have a problem they do something that's good for them. It's nice if it's good for them because then you win either away. But it's a powerful technique when people do it though. When they do it seriously in particularly. It was devised by Milton Messer Erickson and what he would do, for example, an insomniac came in who uh, couldn't sleep, didn't sleep all night. Maybe got two hours sleep and he was exhausted at work. So he asked for help at Gullford. So Erickson told him, ask him uh, what is it you do more of. He asked, "Is that one of the questions you ask?" The guy says, "What do you do more of?" He said, "Read more books." There's a lot of books by scholars that he hadn't read. So Erickson set it up. He said, "I want you to go tonight, only not go to bed. I want you to put your pajamas on and prepare for bed. But then don't go to bed. I want you to read all night long, those books you should read." And since you might fall asleep sitting there reading, I want you to stand at the at the mantle all night long and read books. And you got to read them. So he uh, at bedtime he went to, got in his pajamas and went to the mantle and read all night long. And he did it for three nights. And then uh, he thought he'd lay down and rest his eyes for just a minute and then get up the night. He fell asleep, he slept all night. And uh, he woke up with his work time at 7:00 in the morning. So uh, he then felt guilty because he still owed Erickson a night. And he uh, he decided that he would uh, prepare himself in case this ever happened again. And he went and bought a set of Dickens, and he had it on his shelf so that if he ever didn't sleep he still had that one night that he would have to sit up or stand up and read Dickens all night long. But it's hard on him to read Dickens all night long then he goes to sleep, so he goes to sleep. It's classical Erickson that ordeals. One of the first of his was, was exercise. There was a TV announcer who was beginning to panic before he goes on air and uh, he, he was afraid he'd lose his job if he panicked, he wouldn't get on the air. So, Erickson, Erikson defined his problems as too much energy not **. So he had the guy, uh, exercise before he goes on the air. I think it was 150 deep knee bends. Takes about an hour and a half to do that actually. And he says it has to be enough so you feel it in your muscles when uh, when you're going on the air to broadcast. But exercise is great, is a very precise technique by the way. I had a man who uh, was anxious when he spoke in public. He could hardly stand standing there. And naturally had to postpone on the public on a job where it was all or nothing, it was in education. So I setup that same ordeal, 150 deep knee bends. If he was more anxious than was normal when he, when he was signing up to speak. And he had to decide what was normal. So they get very precise because if it's normal you don't have to do 150 deep knee bends. So he did this and in three sessions. He was perfectly calm when he started to speak at other times he was anxious. This works for a specifics, only when he was standing up to speak and was nervous. That this had to be done, it went a long way. But that's perfectly straightforward. 

00:27:35
penance 

00:27:40
JAY HALEY There's another story for therapist, therapy and that's uh, penance. Penance is very pretty, pretty powerful. I've used it before. But I think you've been adopted. What you do is uh, give somebody a penance, particularly a penance to do something that's helpful to others. That is if you did something that you feel is awful and guilty about what he did, and he only wants to talk about how awful he feels and how guilty he feels. I don't think it's good to have him go on talking about awful he feels and how guilty he is. You need to give him something to do that handles that and that's what penance is. It's something you have to do if you behave badly or if the relatives need help. There was a case uh, with a therapist at my place that was getting calls from people who want, wanted some help immediately with a particular problem. And he got, got a call from a woman in the mid-west who said she had an 18-year old boy who was kill himself. So, they put him in the hospital and they took him seriously because he said he was gonna kill himself on the birthday of his brother who killed himself. So this 18-year old was gonna kill himself on that date. And the therapist said, "Uh, what do I do?" And David Eddy, a therapist at my place, outlined a plan for her. What he had them do was meet together. And the therapist said, " Draw them out on all the nice things that who boy committed suicide, all the nice things he, he did and would do if he lived." And they thought of a lot of things because he was a Boy Scout and he did community volunteer in various things. So, uh, they had quite a few things. So then the task, the directive was to, for the parents of this 18-year old to do those things that boy would have done if he lived. Things he was doing for the community he had to do in the community and so on. And uh, it was an interesting thing that happened to them. The parents were delighted with this idea. They were delighted that somebody told them something to do because they were desperate. And the kid, the 18-year old thought it was a great idea. And he knew exactly what his brother would have done on his birthday. So he wanted to get out of the hospital and go do that. And they let him out. 

00:30:25
The penance was to do all the things his brother would have done had he lived. 

00:30:25
JAY HALEY And he went and did it. But what the whole family did was a penance for the death of that older son that they all felt so terribly guilty about; the, the mysterious death. So, they gave them, the therapist gave them something to do with that. And I thought that was a nice idea. But there's various kinds of penance. One of the uh, better ones is when uh, we have a couple ones. One of them had an affair. Say the husband had an affair and the wife won't forgive him for it. And they fight about it, it went on for years in some cases. But they uh, are angry with each other over this affair. They can't get passed it, they need some way to get past it. So one of the ways they can do it is to say to the wife, "What could your husband do that will make up for you the terrible thing he did?" And she will think of something. And then he has to do it. Sometimes it's best if it's for both of them. Well, I'll tell you an interesting one. If you want to appreciate therapist of the world. There's some interesting Puerto Rican figures. And the one I'm thinking of is the one, he was in New York, this place here. And a man came in with his wife and said that, "My wife had an affair and I don't want to kill her. Is there something else I can do?" 

00:32:05
A Ritual as Penance 

00:32:05
JAY HALEY And the faith healer said, "Let me examine the situation." He saw the wife alone and he came out concluding that it wasn't the wife who had the affair it was the spirit of his first wife who had the affair. And they had to exorcize the first wife so they would have peace between them. So he set them up in, from New York clear up into New England to a little town up in the middle of nowhere. They went up there on the bus. And at that little town they had to walk one mile to a tree. And at that tree they had to go through a ritual who got rid of that spirit. Then they came back. They caught the bus and came; it took them all day for this trek up into New England. But when that was done, it was done. That, that finishes it as a conversation piece or it's never referred to again. It's been taken cared of. And that's penance really. It was for both of them, in a sense it was difficult to get up there and back. Well, okay. Let's take a break for lunch. We'll meet at 1:00. 

00:33:15
Indirect Directives 

00:33:20
JAY HALEY Well, there's some problem where a direct intervention just doesn't work. Or they, they just say, I can't do that because I can't help myself. And then you have to go more indirect. What it depends upon I think is how much power you have, that you the therapist have. If you can tell people to change and they change you have the power. If you uh, if you tell them to change and they don't change then you have to find some other way to reach them. But I think the difference with direct and indirect is your authority. If, if you have the, have the weight to make a change then make them change, why not. If that's what change is what you're after. There's also clever ways, you want to be clever. There's a naturally way if I remember it. What he does is he sees a wife and the husband won't come in. So each session he says to the wife, "I'm sure your husband believes such and such." And then they come in the next week and actually he chooses something the husband would never agree with. And the wife of course reports that to the husband when she gets home. And he does this, I think it's three or four times. And the husband says I got to straighten that man out and comes in. So you can do it that way too. Or you can do it, I know a therapist we trained. When the father wouldn't come in he went down to a bar and found him and persuaded him to come in. I mean you can extend yourself too, yeah; want them. That's part of making up your own therapy, how much personal involvement will you have. 

00:35:15

00:35:15
Children 

00:35:25
JAY HALEY Well, okay. Let me shift the topic a bit. We move up the life scale, the family scale of life. Put the younger, the young kids with problems. One of the things I take care is that family therapy started with discovery that there were two people in a room. And then a big step when there were three; two parents and a child, see. But obviously as therapy went on it got more complicated. Inevitably when it goes on it gets more complicated. And uh, you begin to get other people involved. Like a social worker, whose dealing with the family or a probation officer, or a grandmother. That is you begin to notice that there's more than just one to two people involved in this problem if you look for them. And that the, if you look for them you'll find them, and deal with them. Then the kids you're dealing with has a better chance of getting by in the world. We also discovered that the two parents dealing with the child were in conflict about the child. And their conflict was taking the form of pulling the child in two directions. And you see the child is pulled one way and pulled the other. But what happens then is that and because they're in conflict with each other there's a third person. Usually an older one who's in that situation in conflict with one of the parents and turning them against each other really. That is if you have a couple fighting usually there's somebody older than them playing them off against each other. And you have to deal with that person. Then you find that uh, it's not only a grandmother involved but the grandmother and father are disagreeing about the kid. 

00:37:35
The more adults in conflict the more difficulty kids have. 

00:37:35
JAY HALEY And you begin to see a map of adults in conflict. When the kids are misbehaving at home he's almost often misbehaving at school. So you have the teacher to deal with. And if the teacher gets upset, you have the principal to deal with. So uh, the more adults in conflict the more bizarre the kid or the more pathologic the kid. In terms of hyperactivity or difficulty, you know, doing what he shouldn't do or she. But I thought I'd show a tape of a young mother who is an extraordinary woman in many ways. She's a single mother because she broke up with her husband recently because he was violent for other reasons. And uh, it, it's uh, a tape in which, what comes out step by step are the number of adults in conflict over this, this mother. This mother also uh, has a, is a single mother and the basic conflict of single mothers is their mothers usually. And she's living with her mother and she's in basic conflict because she does, the mother, her mother doesn't agree how she's raising the child. And she would like her mother to cooperate and give her a night out; babysit. And the grandmother really isn't enthusiastic about doing that. She's raised six grandkids and she doesn't want to fight with this kid. 

00:39:05
Case of child masterbating in school 

00:39:05
Reward desired behavior, not undesired behavior. 

00:39:10
JAY HALEY With her individually, you can explain it to the mother right there on how, and then she didn't do it. And add the explanation that previously when she did masturbate, mother held her. So we just reversed it when she didn't. The way her mother held her not very predominant, it worked. If we think that way. But you can also notice that the third month in school and got the teacher to, to give time when she'd go and take her seriously. The uh, mother, the grandmother agreed to babysit and give her a night out every week, which is one of the things she wanted. And the two of them began to deal with the girl every week. The relationships were worked out with grandparents up the street, so that the little girl wouldn't go up there irresponsibly. That is, if you look at everything that was done it was undoing adults in conflict about the little girl. And based on the hypothesis that uh, the adults in conflict, the more there are the more hyperactive the little girl. Oh, they did an interesting thing too, the mother and grandmother developed. They uh, taught the little girl to behave properly socially. How to sit and put her skirt down, how to serve tea. They, they treated her hyperactivity as misbehavior or ignorant behavior really. And the little girl became a pleasure to the grandmother and mother because uh, they enjoyed playing with her, teaching her social behavior and she didn't know what had happened. I don't know if you're familiar with Ms. Manners who um, is the perfect parent. But after a couple of months they were discharged. And I remember their last session. She uh, came in with her report card. And I can remember the therapist saying, "Oh, if Ms. Manners could only see this report card." See, he put a mythical figure in there it was helping guide that with good social behavior. But anyhow, that seemed to help. But I think it's a nice case to illustrate it how you can have so many adults in conflict without even noticing it. They, they just in the woodwork really. And it helps if you systematically negotiate those conflicts. Issues or questions or? It's a situation that's in the country with a 50% divorce rate, the amount of step parents and parents fighting over custody, it's astronomical I think. And it's nice uh, to develop, when you're developing your theory of family to develop a technique to deal with the custody battle of two parents over ruling themselves and the kid over who's gonna have her on the weekend. Well, I, I think it's the same principle two parents in conflict living with the kid is not very different from two parents in conflict not living with the kid or each other. There's certainly conflict in there that we highlight in care. 

00:42:35
Indirect Directive 

00:42:35
Paradox 

00:42:35
JAY HALEY Well let me uh, shift a bit to some indirect directions. Most of them are directives that are having people remain the same as a way of changing them. Essentially, paradox. Paradox is a powerful technique if done well. And uh, I'm sure many of you have tried them. It's a situation where uh, it's easy because you just have people do what they're already doing. And uh, it has quite an effect if you do that. If you just schedule it. But if you can schedule a couple who are bickering and not resolving anything, you can schedule them to have a quarrel that's bickering so they can understand everything. But they need a good time to do it where they won't be interrupted. You have them pick a night like Monday night from 8:00 to 10:00 so they can bicker. And to bicker in a way that doesn't achieve anything. That is you, you describe what they're doing now only schedule it on a certain time. And they will go off and they won't do it. They'll come in and say they forgot or they'll say it's not, we just weren't able to do it. So you extend it longer. They didn't have time so you give them more. Essentially a paradox, I think you can take a person or a couple and just say uh, "I want, maybe, I might be able to help you change. But I'm not sure you're ready for it. So perhaps you shouldn't change right now." And uh, they say they're ready to change. And you say, "Well, I'm not sure of that and I don't want to have you changing when you. There may be, what are the consequences if you do change." What will your husband do if you become more self assertive? That is it takes a whole series of things and make that uh, something they should worry about. And you get into a posture where instead of you pulling the people to change, they're pulling at you to change. It's one of the ways they do it. Um, the paradox can be with couples, can be with individuals, can be with neighbors. There's no uh, no set rule. The only rules I know of are those that say you shouldn't uh, have them do something wrong like, you shouldn't have a drinker drink. He needs to get help with that. And you shouldn't, you shouldn't get in trouble with a paradox. But it's um, one of the things with a good paradox when done well it goes right to the heart of the problem very quickly and you have to be prepared for it. For example, I had a, a man bring in a agoraphobic wife. And I was treating a sample of those as couples. And this man uh, said he had enough of her not leaving, she could leave the house with him or she could leave with her mother, but she couldn't go out otherwise and hadn't ever, well for years. They had four kids. So he had to do everything with the kids and school and all that, that she couldn't do because she couldn't go. And he brought her in to be cured; saying he had enough of this. And he was tired of having to work and also do all these other things. So I told him I was going to ask him to do something silly. And you say that when uh, you think they might say that's silly when you give a directive. If you say it first they can't say it. So I say, "It's gonna, you're gonna think that this is silly but I want you to do it." "And what I want you to do", I said to the guy, "is tomorrow morning when you go to work I want you to tell you wife to stay home." And the wife uh, is there listening to this, not objecting. 

00:46:50
Paradox Tell Agoraphobic Wife to Stay Home 

00:46:50
JAY HALEY And he said, "Okay. I'll tell her to stay home." And they went off. And what happened was the next morning he told her to stay home and ha-ha, that was funny, they had laugh over it. And the next day he went to work and told her to stay home, it wasn't so funny. And the third day she went out to the grocery store for the first time in eight years. And they came for the next session with a very upset husband saying, "Where is my wife gonna go if she starts going out of the house? What she gonna do?" And the wife said, uh, "I've always said if I could leave this house I'd leave with my suitcase in my hand." 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Whoa! 

00:47:30
JAY HALEY So that's what I mean by going to the heart of the problem. It's not, the consequences with paradox are not likely too. But at any rate, uh, that's uh, that's one of the more common indirectives. I think instead of just saying a couple of others maybe I'll show you a paradox. 

00:47:50
Kids Who Set Fires 

00:47:55
JAY HALEY There is uh, a technique I think is more common that was worked out in Philadelphia I believe with Braulio Montalvo, me, and a couple. And that is to uh, do something about firesetters, kids who set fires; scares everybody to death. And uh, we began to encourage them to set fires as a way of treating them. This didn't always be welcomed to the parents. But if we persuaded them it was going to be, these were going to be a safe fire, it was all right. And uh, Braulio Montalvo made a little film called A Family With A Little Fire. Because a little girl set the mattress on fire in the apartment while mother was off at work. And scared everybody half to death. 

00:48:50
Braulio Montalvo 1972 

00:48:50
JAY HALEY And they brought her, the mother brought the kid in. And Braulio worked with the family, with the poor family. It was a very, very poor families. 

00:49:00
BRAULIO MONTALVO [non-English narration] Okay. So I would like you to hold Mommy's hand. Okay. Now Mommy's gonna teach you how to play with matches so that you don't get hurt and so you don't hurt anybody. Okay. 

00:49:15
JAY HALEY But anyhow, uh, we got down to do a series. It turns out a lot ticked off parents. And uh, sometimes and issue was made of and sometimes not. But I'll show you a, a friendly one of a fire setter. One of the ways, one of the things you do is encourage them to set fires. Which make them a dump firesetter. If they really want to know how to do this and uh, that has a big effect on firesetters; especially if it's done wrong. And this one I'm gonna show you, they killed uh, this tree. The therapist was programmed to treat the kid as a dumb firesetter or dump generator if he was gonna set fires around. But because the fire he set was pretty severe. The mother and the father are military and they had a picnic on an ammunitions ground and the kid set fire there. And this uh, encouraged them to bring him into therapy. So that's what this is. It begins with them talking about fires and the therapist saying uh, this kid doesn't really know much about them. And then implements a program that you can do and should do with firesetters I think. 

00:50:30
Make Firesetter a Dumb Firesetter 

00:50:30
Paradox 

00:50:30
Teaching Kid to Set a Safe Fire 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Five times a day, okay, I would like the two of you, father and son to get together and do exactly what you do in here. Set a fire, put it out safely. 

00:50:50
The Structure Goal is to Get Father and Son to do a Task together other than around the Symptom like going to the library together. 

00:50:55
JAY HALEY Actually the guy was pretty busy so he would wake him up at night sometimes too to build a fire. But the, one of the purposes of this is structure. To get the father and, and the boy together, doing a task together. And goes with setting a fire which is the symptom to other things, like other things like going to the library or running about, learning about fire. But as far as we know he never set a fire again. And that works, works very well. 

00:51:20
Metaphor 

00:51:25
JAY HALEY There's another side of indirect techniques and that's metaphor. Which works clearly if you're comfortable with, if they work with dreams and such. But sometimes you can change A if you go on the side of B and uh, that's all metaphoric. One, one aspect of metaphoric to another. As an example we had a family with parents and two kids. And the mother came with the bad kid, one was a good kid. But we had the bad kid in pretty good shape. And they were near discharge when the mother said, "Since you did so well with the kids how about doing something about my husband." Who had been in therapy one time. Focus on the child. So, uh, the father said, no, he wouldn't participate in any way in any marriage therapy. He was uh, there to save his kid but didn't want anything to do with the marriage. And uh, I think it was probably because his wife was so much more articulate than he was. And he thought he wouldn't hold his own in a marriage discussion. But anyhow, we went ahead and chose if we turned him loose will the kid improve with an unhappy marriage or doing something uh, or trying force him because this guy was pretty stubborn or uh, trying to do it metaphorically. And what we end up doing is having the parents talk about the two kids as metaphoric to their relationship. That is there was one uh, battered kid and one bitter kid. The father was battered and the mother was bitter. So they could uh, talk about the battered kid and the good kid. Actually, metaphoric to their own relationship. And uh, you never know when you do this what people realize what you doing or not. But uh, sometimes they can shift from a metaphoric view of the world. In this particular time they didn't. They were talking about the two boys and how the problem was he should have some time to himself. And the father said yes, that's what everybody needs, time to themselves. You come home from work you want a beer quietly. You can't have one because all the problems, they get dumped on you. So did they parallel the kids pops up out and pops back again as you work metaphorically. It's a courtesy therapy is what it is. You're, you're talking about something in such a way that it's about something else so they can't be upset about it. And that's an interesting therapy. 

00:54:10
Do Nothing 

00:54:15
JAY HALEY There's another therapy that uh, is a curious one. One of the things you can do is do nothing and that's a technique. In fact Carl Mellinger wrote a book on such analysis; a good book. And he purposed that the care of the factor in psycho analysis was uh, the fact that was frustration. When a person came to an analysist to get help. And the analysist didn't do anything and all the frustration the patient uh, took action in their own lives to make some changes. So that the changes were caused by frustration. Which is an interesting thing. It's one of the few interpersonal theories in uh, psycho analysis. So you can do that. What you can do is do nothing and all the frustration the people will take action. You know, I, I saw it done in an interesting way in San Francisco one time. Bill Erickson, was uh, giving a hypnotic demonstration. He would give a demonstration to a group of people, I guess. And he asked for volunteers to come up and demonstrate resistance. Which is a curious thing to ask to begin with. If they're gonna volunteer be resistant. Uh, and anyhow he stood up there waiting for a volunteer. A volunteer came up from the audience. Would you grab my hand, and the young man stood in front of Erikson. And Erikson just stood there and the young man was in a trance. And uh, I asked Erikson later how did you do that? Because I was always curious how he did things. I said, "How did you get that guy in a trance?" And Erikson said, "I didn't." I said, "I saw him go in a trance, I was right there." And Erikson said, "No, I didn't do anything." He said, "That young man came up in front of all those people, and uh, somebody had to do something." And I wasn't doing anything. So he did he went in a trance. That's a do nothing election. So there's all kinds of ways to do it. 

00:56:35
Absurd Task 

00:56:35
JAY HALEY There's also some absurd tasks uh, that are good for scientific people because they're so logical. The ability, the disadvantage by ability. But at any rate, those are some of the indirect techniques that I hope you people would likely categorize in the future. The uh, they're interesting to use and develop and take some skill. The, particularly the metaphor, the paradox are the ones that are easy. 

00:57:15

00:57:15
Adolescence 

00:57:20
JAY HALEY Well, let me shift the topic from this uh, adolescence, as I move up the family life cycle. There's a uh, there's a young lady who was only referred to as a 14-year old girl. And the parents had wanted a son. They were referred because uh, the therapist gave up on them and others had to, I believe. One therapist retrained gave up on them. And she was busy because of retraining. So she had done whatever she could with this family. And uh, they came in with the problem that the daughter was running the family and there had been some violence. That uh, she hit her mother. But there's a whole variety of things she'd do or did. One of the uh, issues with adolescence is most of them have three or four ways to uh, discombobulate their parents. This girl had about 14. And her parents didn't have that many. There's a book on that, I don't know if I mentioned it. On how adolescence are smarter than their parents and that's why they win a lot of these struggles. But at any rate, this uh, family came in, and what I'll show you is the interview that begins with the, uh. Let me see a show of hands, how many of you know what the Gandhi technique is? David in the back knows. He saw the film. What do you know. I think California deserves it because this is a technique used in this, this tape. And it's a pretty powerful technique. This is a good idea when you have an ambiguous family that maybe violent even. That you uh, summarize what you know about whether they're at and what's the problem because uh, they don't want anything to do with you. 

00:59:45
NEIL SCHIFF, PHD I understood that, that uh, was having some problems. Uh, on a couple of occasions uh, you became very upset and uh, were uh, violent towards, in, in uh, the household. But since then uh, you haven't been. It's just been uh, kind of rough from what your mother said during the course of phone conversa-. 

01:00:05
Ghandi Technique 

01:00:05
JAY HALEY Lets see uh, Ghandi technique. If you haven't seen the Ghandi technique, it's too bad. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:20
Neil Schiff, PhD 

01:00:20
NEIL SCHIFF, PHD But, but the thing is that you need something to do if, if the situation should arise. Even though we hope and expect that it won't. Where she's making a threat at you or herself or something like that. And I, you need a very powerful uh, something to do, okay. And what you've told me is you'll do anything, no matter what. Because even though it might be inconvenient and expensive in the short term if it solves the problem it's worth it because your piece of mind is important to all of you. And you got to get on with enjoying your lives again. Okay. So uh, you need something to do and I'm gonna tell you what it is. And I don't expect anybody to complain about it or anything else even though it's a terrible thing it'll help, okay. If threatens harm to herself or anyone else or tries to harm herself or anyone else, nobody goes to school or work that night, from that moment, for the next 24 hours the first time it happens. That is you all stay home. 

01:01:25
UNKNOWN But I have a job. 

01:01:25
NEIL SCHIFF, PHD The thing is if this gets uh, if this gets worse what's gonna happen is that you're gonna end up taking so much time off work you're gonna lose your job anyway. You know what I mean? It's like, and, and it's a, it's a terrible, it's a terrible solution but it's worked before and it'll work again. That is if she's threatening herself or somebody else it means she's not thinking properly and the only way to handle this is for all of you to stay with her at home for the following 24 hour period. Period, no work, no nothing. Don't leave the house, she doesn't leave either, everybody stays here together. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN So. 

01:02:05
NEIL SCHIFF, PHD Because all of you together could restrain her. Okay, even though it's a big sacrifice you do what you can to get your uh, get your children over their problems. And everybody says, it's inconvenient I'll lose my job and so forth. And the thing is it's true you might but I don't think so. 

01:02:20
JAY HALEY On uh, that too, the, the parents renewed their vows. And it might of been (inaudible ) But anyhow there was uh, a tremendous technique the Ghandi technique. All they do is ask people to stay home. Usually the threat of it is enough to change people. The idea of all of them staying home together for 24 hours it's hard on people. But it's been used, Neil Schiff uh, and and Manny Belscheff wrote a paper on this maybe five years ago called the Ghandi Technique I think, the Ghandi Technique. And they used it uh, with a variety of problems. Including uh, one, one of them was a, a salesman who couldn't make the call he was suppose to make. So he was to list how many calls he should make and if he didn't make those in one day, the whole family stayed home for 24 hours. And this put tremendous pressure on everybody because the kids are out of school and so on. And they take it very seriously. As she did, she told her supervisor she might have to stay home. How, how serious it was, I remember a family where the boy is out in the middle west in the Army and couldn't wait to get home to sit down literally with everybody. So he asked for sick leave and sat in the barracks while everybody sat in the home. So they take it seriously. It, it wouldn't be routine to sit in the living room. They have to stay in the house. But I was remembering when they did have to sleep in the living room. And that threat was worse than the other. Families, families know that they can't get this kind of togetherness. And they take it very seriously. Well okay. Let me give you a, Morduvo(ph) case or more of a problem. The solution wasn't so far away. The um, this is a girl whose 17 and has had every dope known to man. And uh, she's probably had every treatment there is. Some simultaneously as she, she lists them at some point here. And she's sick, sick of being treated. And uh, she has a mother and father who are separated. Father's married again and has, as you'll see it he has the new wife. The mother was married again and divorced, so she divorced twice. And their problem is with this girl she in Happy Manor or one of those psychiatric places. And she's got to come out because the insurance is running out. And father won't take her and even the mother won't take her. So there's no place for her to go. They've just have had enough they won't take her. So they shift to therapist, works with them and goes along with they're not taking her in. And this scene I'm showing is the girl talking to Neil about life. And uh, her dope problem. What had happened that changed everything is she was stealing for, for her habit, her cocaine habit. And she was stealing from the, the bank, ATM thing of her mother. And she took, they thought it was minor. It turns out $16,000. And uh, it was a machine that took a picture. So there was no question she did it. And now that would put her in jail for five years apparently. And it gave the mother the power to put her in jail. And the girl was scared of jail. So the mother had power over her for the first time in a long time really. So this starts talking to her and later gets the family in. But the um, she's a nice young lady in a middle-class family, in an upper-class neighborhood. And, and uh, she's just getting kicked out of high school. Once I think in this session she say she'd like to uh, finish her high school and then go to college. That's the only positive thing she says about anything, about the future. But let me um, put it on. We usually don't encourage people to express their feelings but around an issue we will. Because we know it's important. Well, this is adventure wasn't over with this drama. What happened was that they put her on a, this half way house, that night and she smoked a joint. She violated their law. So mother and this guy, mother and father and new wife came over and uh, took her to the service office. Mother was gonna file charges because she had said if she takes dope I'll file charges. So they went to this nice service office in this nice community. They were very nice. And they said it got confusing because she did this at 17, she was now 18. So what jurisdiction they fell under they weren't sure. But then uh, they did a dumb thing really. They talked to the daughter and the mother about how they could get off on any charges if they would report on friends who had taken drugs and become spies, spying. The mother got furious they wanted to do that to her daughter. So she took the daughter and marched over to me and we had another session. I got about where is she gonna go because she, they won't let her home. So we had a long session in there. And the girl got more upset as we went along. And Neil began to worry about suicide, so did the mother. So they decided to end the session by taking her to the psychiatric emergency ward, which they did. And they accepted her. And everybody went away relieved because this had been handled. The young lady talked to a psychiatrist in the psychiatric ward. And he concluded she shouldn't be hospitalized and she wasn't crazy. So he turned her out, with no place to go. Neil was getting involved in whether to have a civil division on, he was so mad. This guy turned this girl loose. But anyhow, uh, she went loose. Disappeared I think for about three or four days and she reappeared again at her mother's house. Her mother turned her in. And brought, she wouldn't come to therapy but she came over with her mother to see this film. They remembered they being videotaped and they wanted to see, so we showed it to them. And uh, what happened next. The girl just said flatly she wouldn't come near therapy. But the mother said I want some therapy and began to see Neil individually. As she saw Neil individually she improved. Therapy got her life straightened out pretty fast. And at that the girl began to straighten out. Which is a good hypothesis to have in relation to the mother. But anyhow, the uh, the girl got herself a job as a receptionist, got her GED all in a couple of months here, and went off to college. And uh, I don't know what happened. She was still in college a year later but how her life is like I don't know. But that's the one plan, she was never shown was to do that. At any rate uh, the mother improved remarkably and uh, and her business she did very well. Having a positive change in the girl was her realization that her husband, her father wasn't gonna help her. He wasn't gonna get out early, he wasn't gonna help her pay back the money. And uh, I think she thought it would go differently. There was a guy with an uncle who was a drinker so he was familiar with problems like that. And uh, they had talk to her about it. So he was familiar more than the mother with that, with that side of life. But this is based on uh, on an approach of the family.

Case of Heroin Addiction 

01:11:45
JAY HALEY I don't know whether everybody assumes that. That uh, you have, we have an addict or a mother calling saying, "My daughter's a heroin addict and uh, what I'd like to do something about her. Can we get therapy?" And the therapist said uh, "Who all is living in the household?" And she said, "My husband and our daughter and we have two sons who don't live with us." So, the therapist said, "Would you bring in your husband and your daughter for the first session." The mother said that, or "and, and your son who lived nearby." And she said the son wouldn't come in. He didn't speak to the daughter. And the father wasn't speaking to the daughter. So he won't come in." So the therapist said, "Can I talk to him." She got on the phone with him and said, "I'd like you to come in for the first session with your wife and daughter." And he said he didn't want to. And she said, "Would you for my sake come in? It's very important that I have you for the first time." He said, "Okay." Then when he got there he said, I only did this for her. He didn't want to act like he was excusing his daughter by coming in. He was so mad at her, she shot up when she promised not to, and he was mad. But anyhow, we would assume that uh, the, the addiction, the heroin was taking, was in response to the family. I mean you can have a theory that sounds good or a theory that is even companions or on drugs. You can have many kinds of theories. I like the one that it's in the family. And that it has, it's related to the way the parents are dealing with each other. And so we would want to bring them in, parents and daughter at least to begin to deal with that. We know when we bring them in we're gonna put the parents in charge of stopping the daughter from taking heroin. 

01:13:50
Use the Family to Stop the Addiction 

01:13:55
JAY HALEY They weren't up for this opportunity. They said, "All our lives we've tried to stop her from doing it." You give them the task and you assume that whatever you pull them together to deal with her that uh, she'll stop. And so it's a problem of getting them to pull together to deal with her. We just had this scene. But anyhow, those ideas are mixed in of this approach to addiction. And there's a couple of pretty good books on it though with self, with a good outcome. But we treated that, those cases the same way we treated young psychotics. By putting the parents in charge. But anyhow, I want to emphasize that because I want to make clear that this approach wasn't pulled out of the air. Its been around for about 15 years now. It's just not publicized well.

Retirement and Aging 

01:14:55
JAY HALEY One of the things I was suppose to do was get there with age. And I don't know if I'll make it. The uh, I would ordinarily end this playing a tape about and now that you're ready I'll describe it instead. I think it's a new feeling that when you were younger. Because they're living forever. And you don't know how to deal with it when you get old and older. I mean I remember one father where he would, I'd ask him to do something's with his father who was older. And he said uh, "What does a 56-year old man do with an 80-year old man?" There's no rules on that. What else, what should I do take him to the zoo or what. Because we haven't had at that age a whole set of standards and ideas. There are, one of them, one of the couples we were dealing with illustrated the truth about protecting. The couple came in with the guy was depressed and shaking. And his wife was angry because she couldn't do anything because she had to take care of him. And all she wanted was to get away to the library and read and do some research. And uh, she couldn't because he got, he would block the door and say she couldn't leave him. So we worked with them and we had, he used to paint and we got him painting again. And uh, turned uh, turned much less depressed. And he went to a class to uh, to paint, painting class. And he was reported on with her later in the day when they had a session. And he said that his painting modern at that place or something like that. And his wife said no that isn't what you were painting. You were painting more old fashioned style. So the therapist said to the wife, "How did you know that?" And she said, "Well, she hadn't reported unless it was, while he was in class and she could go in and stuff." But it turns out she went over. And she said, "Well I went around and watched through the window to make sure he was all right." And you have that kind of protection going on until the end of time really. And so, it's an interesting problem. There was another thing we learned on that case. They left improved but not greatly improved as far as we were concerned. And uh, you know we didn't count it as a failure but we counted it as not too successful and turned them loose. And we got a call from the geriatrics center who referred them and said, you've done a marvelous job. The guys 80% improved over his depression. You've done wonders. And we then began to realize what happened the day they left us complaining. So we judged the outcome by how they were complaining. And uh, that's not a good way to judge outcome with the elderly because they're gonna complain anyhow. Life is a complaint. So uh, it was lesson about of which we don't even know yet. Of how do you evaluate outcome with somebody who's 85 years old and complaining about feeling lousy. So the age is a problem and there's more and more of us. And all of you are gonna get that way. So you should think about it. This woman I was gonna show was a, is a woman who's 82 I think, and was uh, visiting a son, her son-in-law, her son and her daughter-in-law. And her daughter-in-law is the worst daughter-in-law in the history of mankind, according to this woman. And her son has been corrupted by that daughter-in-law. But she went over to visit and she sat down on the kitchen floor and wouldn't move and panicked the young couple because they didn't think they'd ever get rid of her. And they were already taking care of the wife's 90-year old father. So uh, we took them on deciding not to make it a family session because they were so mad at her when they finally got her off the kitchen floor and out of there. That uh, it didn't look sensible to bring them all together while they were so mad. So we figured if we could change the woman's some then she'd be more acceptable to them because they'd see that she was not manipulate enough to be part of the family. So uh, the therapist, a young man who uh, likes old people. Which I think is very helpful if you're doing Gerry with him. But he really is curious about them. He listens to them and he's curious about them. And he helped her get a new set of clothes really. And uh, and bring herself up again. She had more self confidence. She had been kicked out of her retirement community which is really hard to do.

Richard Spector, PhD 

01:20:30
RICHARD SPECTOR, PHD I'd like to, I'd really like to see you get back to that good life. And I'd really like to see you being able to turn it around again. And, and I'd like to be able to help you with that. I think we need to figure out ways for you to get that good life back. I think we need to think about what you used to do to make that good life happen. And what you used to do to turn around and figure out ways for you to, to be able to turn it around again and, and practice that. And, and fight that negativity. 

01:21:05
UNKNOWN I have some money put aside to buy clothes. But everything is uh, is a big deal. 

01:21:15
RICHARD SPECTOR, PHD Well, I think the process of turning it around and creating the good life again is a step by step process that you recover slowly. And it sounds like you had some setbacks and it sounds like you lost some of your confidence uh, and that now you're feeling better and want to get the good life again. But you're trying to do it all at once. And maybe the thing to do is to try to do it more slowly and piece by piece. Um, one little step at a time. It's a process of building it slowly back and getting that confidence back. It seems to me if you had the confidence the positive things you say to yourself would work. 

01:22:00
UNKNOWN I'd like to bring in one to two pieces at a time. And replace it with something new. I'd say maybe if I had some new clothes I'd feel better. 

01:22:10
RICHARD SPECTOR, PHD I think it's that you haven't made a decision yet. 

01:22:15
UNKNOWN But when it comes to. 

01:22:15
RICHARD SPECTOR, PHD That you're still. Well, I think. 

01:22:15
UNKNOWN Terrible. 

01:22:20
RICHARD SPECTOR, PHD I think, you know, that you have made the decision that you're going to make the good life for yourself, to take the small steps that are necessary to get it back. Well, a commitment means we're starting something, it means really going ahead and starting it. And I think for you tomorrow that means taking two things out of your closet that are just no good anymore. 

01:22:45
UNKNOWN They're old. 

01:22:45
RICHARD SPECTOR, PHD Two old things out of the closet, get rid of them, get to Kmart and get two things, nice things that would replace it. It is difficult when there's a lot of talking. I think that action, and I think you know this. I think that action is much more important than talking and that's why I'd like you to promise me that you will tomorrow get up throw those two items you don't want out, get to Kmart and get two items to replace it. And that you'll make a deal with me that you'll do that. Promise? 

01:23:25
UNKNOWN If I make a promise I give it to you. 

01:23:25
JAY HALEY It was only a few sessions in, in helping her buy some clothes that made her feel better, that she cooperated uh, and got together with her son and daughter-in-law. And then the son came in, was the first session. The daughter-in-law didn't. But the uh, the therapy included the daughter-in-law coming over her apartment, picking her up and taking her back for Sunday dinner. And she began to do that every Sunday. And that was the daughter-in-law who been fronted by for sure by this lady. And the lady said, "Oh, it's nothing now." But it was really something for that family. 

01:24:05
Emphasis is on Doing Simple Things that Achieve Specific Ends 

01:24:05
JAY HALEY Anyhow, the emphasis in the tape is on doing simple things, short term simple things that achieve specific ends. Like getting them to do something. Like getting them to go to a dance or to start a. Usually they, you get depressed over people and you have to associate with them in such a way they come out of it and begin to try something's in life again. And I think it's gonna be a specialty in before long with therapist to deal with older people. In fact they maybe already. Okay, it's quitting time. Thank you, thank you too.
