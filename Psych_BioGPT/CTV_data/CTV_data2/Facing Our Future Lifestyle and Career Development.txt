00:00:45
Dr. Tom Sweeney COUNSELOR EDUCATOR 

00:00:45
DR. TOM SWEENEY Many people seem to think of retirement as a long vacation with no responsibilities and nothing but leisure activities. Nothing could be further from the truth. Notions that older people have no need for dreaming, planning or working are equally false, and yet, many of the people who believe these ideas are among the older population themselves. The healthiest, happiest and longest living persons tend to be the most goal-oriented, plan-full and active members of the older population. Their pattern for this lifestyle can be found in their younger years as well. Our goal as counselors, working with older persons, includes helping them to apply the same methods, techniques and attitudes to their later life as could have been used in their younger years. I say "could have been used in their younger years" because many of our older persons today never had an opportunity to benefit from career and lifestyle counseling. In this program, we want to identify key concepts and activities important to career and lifestyle counseling with older persons. Among these are: pre-retirement planning, work and leisure activities and adjustment to lifestyle. 

00:01:50
1. PRE-RETIREMENT PLANNING 

00:01:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY There's evidence to support the conclusion that retirement is more readily accepted and results in more positive outcomes when there's prior planning. By making decisions about retirement, retirees are able to maintain an internal locus of control and sense of power in their lives. In fact, optimum adjustment occurs when retirement is the culmination of careful planning over a period of years. Note how the individuals in the following interviews report their experiences with respect to pre-planning for their retirement. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN I think it's very important if you can stay where your roots are. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Ah, it makes a lot of difference. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN  The thing is, though, I wanted, is the young, and I was active. You come in when you're active and spend the rest of your life as it should be. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN That's right, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN And when I'm up in my 90s, I want, you know, have some young girls coming in, 65s, so loosen it up a bit. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN (Laughs) 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN  I think your point is ah, that, that people should make the transition when they're healthy... (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN ...and they have the resources, ah, when they can take advantage of the facility and when they can establish a network of friends and associates that... (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN ...as problems come along, they have that network to depend on and help them, and I guess that's what I hear you saying. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN  If we could all just realize that this is a stage. For instance, the life as stages as we go along. We call it, start to school, and then we graduate from high school, and then the next, this is (inaudible ), then we get married, then we go through a stage. Well, all these stages mean a lot at that time, but if, as we move to another stage, we could just forget, we left other things that were all, ah, so much importance, then the previous stage may not be needed now at all. Just discard those things together probably and move on to the next step. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Let go and take advantage of where you're going. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN But others resist it, "Oh, I'm not that old yet." "I'm not ready yet," even though they are. They just can't make up their minds for this last step. This is the last phase. They, they don't accept it as the last. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Uhmm, there, there, so there's a denial of even getting old? 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Oh yes. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yes, very much so. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN They're absolutely common. A remark when you speak to them about coming here, "Oh, I'm not that old yet." 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN  (laughs) 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Even though they are. (laughs) 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN (Laughs) 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Well, they look at age in a, in a different way. We looked at it, well, why not come here then we don't have to, whenever we wanna take a trip, we do not have to, ah, take care of the house because it's already locked up. And we can get friends to pick up our mail out of the mailbox, so (laughs). 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN  There are a lot of conveniences to. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Oh, definitely. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN We are, we're a little bit behind the (inaudible ) we've only been married 57 years. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN (Laughs) 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Oh. Just a little bit behind, not much. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN But you know we have one man who is such a beautiful example of moving and adjusting in Russ Damberg(ph), who was a... (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN ...piano professor at the university in the Music Department for years and years. And his wife died, and we helped him, encouraged him to come, and his son teaches in Ohio, and they couldn't come, and he didn't wanna go up that area(ph), so we have to make up with his mind and I was so afraid he wouldn't be happy. Do you know he's the one who did all these watercolors? He plays the piano every night for dinner. He loves this and he never stops a minute, and I said, "If we could just, if everybody could adjust like that." (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN He rebelled before coming in. No, he didn't wanna come in, he didn't wanna anybody to tell him what he had to do. The minute he walked in, he said, "This is what I'm gonna do and this is my life." 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN Great. 

00:05:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY There's no social activity more important to a healthy person than work. When work is mentioned, most people immediately think of business, industry and similar job situations that involve pay, benefits, vacations, and such. This is a narrow definition of work. Work involves an activity that contributes to the lifestyle of self or others in a positive way: making beds, washing dishes, collecting money for charity and making goods for others to enjoy or driving friends to church or the supermarket. All of these and more represent work activities, too. The relatively recent interest in fast food and other businesses hiring older persons are once again dispelling some old myths. These myths include the idea that older persons are slow, often absent, unable to adjust, inflexible, less intellectually-able and, generally, just less desirable workers. I invite you to consider the interview with Sara as only one illustration of how wrong these misconceptions really are. 

00:06:35
SARA Then after he died, I, uhm, stayed on in the home here and then went to Korea. (inaudible ) one day asking me if I would go out so I went to teach missionaries' children and had, I taught 1960, '61, '62, and then I came back. I have never had any social security to live, Mission Board put me on, uhm, social security, so I had a half and a whole and a half year, so I said to Dr. Gowen(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Ah, excuse me, Sar, did, did you go to Korea then when you were in your 60's? 

00:07:10
SARA Yes. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN (laughing) Okay. 

00:07:15
SARA 60. Yes, that's right. I would be 60 years old. That's the reason I said, "Do you think that I could go? Could I take the weather?" It's so cold out there. Just wind blows down from Siberia, but it was wonderful. Well, anyway, I've enjoyed being church visitor, it's just a wonderful job. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN You're very busy at that work, too. 

00:07:30
SARA  Busy still, yes. I meant. (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Tell me about a typical day. What's your typical day? 

00:07:35
SARA Well, I make about 150 or 200 a month, (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:07:40
SARA visits a month, (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
SARA contacts for the church. I usually go out, well, Wednesday. Every Wednesday is Church day, is my day to go to the hospitals, and I go to north region and to the Alachua, Alachua General and to Shands. I don't go to Shands every week, but when we know someone's there, I do. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. Do you drive yourself? 

00:08:05
SARA Oh, yes, I drive. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
SARA Just yesterday, I was told I couldn't drive at night anymore, but, ah, I could drive in the daytime. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN How do you feel about that? 

00:08:10
SARA Oh, I was just, I was just devastated that I can't drive at night. But there are lots of people that say they'll pick me up. Tonight, someone's picking me up to go to the village for dinner tonight. And Monday night, someone's picking me up. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
SARA I can drive, you see, to go down to church on Wednesday night, it's daylight, but it's dark when we come back. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
SARA And so, I'm just beginning, I don't know how it's gonna work out, but I may have cataracts, and when I get that, maybe I can see all right. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
SARA But I can still drive in the daytime. I drove to, to Lumberton for Christmas. I drove to, to Lumberton for Christmas, 500 miles up and back... (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
SARA ...by myself. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:08:50
DR. TOM SWEENEY Employment opportunities are becoming increasingly available as employers experiment with new strategies, such as breaking jobs into component parts, creating two or more part-time jobs in place of one full-time position and partial or trial retirement periods. The government is sponsoring a variety of part-time programs for older workers as well. As a consequence, experts believe that career counseling will be increasingly important to older persons in the future. Not all older persons, however, want or are willing to continue in work activity for pay, or otherwise. In fact, in 1980, it was estimated that 86 percent of the persons over 65 years of age were retired from gainful employment. These individuals were indoctrinated into the work ethic, which said that the day would come when they would no longer work as such(laughs), and they believed it. They're among those who want a life of leisure pursuits. Though still not fully developed, there's a growing body of literature related to leisure counseling. This is an area with exciting possibilities for enriching the lives of many older persons. Leisure is an activity chosen primarily for its own sake. Freedom to choose that which brings pleasure, satisfaction, accomplishment, and contentment has its own rewards. Leisure provides opportunity for self-expression, personal development, and socialization, which is helpful in coping with later life stresses. In the following illustrations, you can observe how leisure activities sustain individuals in coping with changing life circumstances. At 87 years of age, Sara is still a vital contributing member of her church and community. She makes an average of a hundred and fifty home and hospital visits per month to those less fortunate, and also calls members of her church to wish them happy birthday. What makes this illustration even more significant is the knowledge that within the last two years, this courageous woman has had her home burglarized and she was badly beaten. On another occasion, her home and belongings sustain significant damage as a result of a fire. Where would you know the full history, we would no doubt find a woman whose life has had its share of trials. Through all of these experiences, she sustained herself with activity in contribution to others. In her leisure, besides gardening, Sara is taking a lifetime of experiences, memories and personal history and weaving it into a legacy for the future. She's preparing to donate her home and its memorabilia as a museum for future generations. 

00:11:25
SARA I am on the board of the, ah, Latchway(ph) County Historical Society, and we're working on this house because it is so historical that James Douglas Mathis, and then Christopher Mathis, and then say, you're living here a little longer. Ah, I want it, we're, we're getting it, uhm, making, uhm, corporation. And it is to be I'm giving the, the house and all this beautiful lot down. You see it's a big territory on this side of the street. And we're to have, ah, some trustees and then we want to get it endowed. So we're working on that and Mark, Dr. Mark Barra(ph) is gonna help with that and Ms. Lotoure(ph), through the Historical Society and Historical Gainesville and, well, lots of organizations. So, I'm still in that. We have, ah, we have had plates made and stationery to sell, you know, little bits of things to sell. But we want it to be a house museum and maybe connect it with the library. The library's going to be built down here. We thought, maybe, children could meet here and have meetings in the house. 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
SARA We don't know just exactly how it's to be used but, ah, that's my, and I'm to live here as long as I'm able to live here. And I'd like to stay as long as I can. So, I'm interested in the history, you see. I belong to the State Historical Society as well the local. In fact, we're going down to Evanston Sunday afternoon to put a marker by the old store and post office at Evanston. And Mrs. Wood(ph) had it, that she's so glad they're gonna mark it. Then I'm Friends of Music. I support that very well and we are going Saturday night to the big... (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Sara, I'm getting... (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
SARA ...cabaret. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN  I'm, I'm feeling all you do. Ah, are there any disadvantages to getting older? 

00:13:25
SARA No, I never think of my age(laughs). No. I just can't. When people say, "Are you really 86 years old?" And I have to stop and think, am I really? I, I should. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Don't feel like it. 

00:13:35
SARA I don't feel like it. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:35
DR. TOM SWEENEY  In the following illustration, we hear from persons whose lives are made richer by a variety of activities. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Me? (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN I go fishing, go to the garden(ph). And all of that. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. You're still able to drive yourself around? 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah, I drive every day. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. Yeah. Drive every day. Drive my truck. Drive my car. Yeah. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN And you, you worked for the city before. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN And, and what did you do when you worked for the city? 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN I was a mechanic for the city. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Okay. So you still do mechanical work on your own cars? 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN On my own cars. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN At home. Run my own 'lil business. 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN You have your own business now? 

00:14:15
UNKNOWN My own business, and at home. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN So you repair other people's cars. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN  Hey, that's great. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Well, I tell you, they, ah, they fudged me a great thing. They furnished all my license. Now, with them(ph), I don't have to pay for no license or nothin' like that. 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN Now, you mean, the people who asked you to do work? 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN No, the city furnished them. 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN The city furnished... (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Your license? 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. I don't have to furnish no license. They all had, for me. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN Well, that's great. It sounds like you're doing good. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN Oh yes. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN  One of the most important things is to keep active. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN : Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN To keep to, to keep doing things. Ah, ah, sitting in a room all day long, ah, isn't good for you. I've had, have that. I have, ah, worse part of my time like when I came to Gainesville. And I've been there for six months so I ended up in a hospital. And, ah, with pneumonia, I simply wasn't taking care of myself and, ah, I didn't care. Nothing bothered me, ah, thoroughly disgusted with everything. And, ah, that's the only thing that I can say that, ah, don't worry about getting old because you're gonna get old. They're not quite about it. So, why worry about it? And I'm not worried about it now. I could afford to be in another (laughs). 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN  I never have given up very much (laughs) I just took on more (laughs) by having activities here. And still having activities in town. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN  So, can you tell me something about those? What kind of activities are you still... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Oh, I... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN ...engaged in? 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN Belong to these. (laughs). Yes, I, ah, have church affiliating meetings and I have, uhm, I stayed with the League of Women voters and when it started being much more active when I, after I have retired, in some of these things. And I've been active, uhm, very much interested in early childhood. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN  In pre-school education, trying to promote that... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN ...in Gainesville. And, uhm, I belong to, ah, a club, ah, a Soroptomist club, which is a business women club. I can't remember all the things I do belong to(laughs). (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN (Laughs) 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN  And, uhm, I like it in the retired faculty, (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN that meets once a week, ah, most of the year. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN And so that's very interesting to learn a lot about what's going on at the university over the total university instead of one college, one department, and so forth. So, ah, I am still, don't have time to think (laughs). 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN You can try to find some place to fit in some exercise. 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN That's right (laughs). Just haven't had the time. But I'm going to, now. I, every once in a while, I make a new resolution. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN (laughs) 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN I started this morning. 

00:17:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY While much can be said about the advantages of the leisure lifestyle when it's well planned and followed, there are adjustments as well. Some of these come as the result of anticipated life adjustments, such as retirement. Life and career adjustments, however, also relate to adjustments to the changing health, economic circumstances, or losses of possessions, friends, and family, over which we have no control. Even though we know that they can happen, we are rarely prepared to deal with them until they do happen. As one's vision, hearing, or physical abilities lose their familiar sharpness, reflexes, or strength, other losses can be even more significant. In the following interview, taken from the card-playing fellows, which you've just seen, we have an opportunity to hear the story of a very successful, positive-thinking businessman whose wife's illness and subsequent death took him into a journey of depression and despair. Once an avid golfer and active athlete, he uses a wheelchair to get around to most places today. You'll no doubt want to pay close attention to his journey back to positive mental health. 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN Well, they put my wife in a hospital, one of, nursing home, rather. One of the first things that happened down there, she wouldn't eat. And, ah, unfortunately, she couldn't tell 'em that she wouldn't eat. She just would, just wouldn't eat. And the doctor called me and asked me if I would feed her. So I went up the nursing home every day. I spent, oh, usually from noon to about five o' clock in the nursing home every day. That had lasted for about six months until I went downhill and ended up in summer 1985 with pneumonia. And when I came out of the hospital, the, ah, I had a bad hip and the doctor recommended to my family that we move up to Gainesville where we had a daughter. So we come up here in January of '86 and put her right in a nursing home and I rented an apartment. And, ah, at that time I was 85. And, ah, I was in an area where there practically all young people, business people. During the day, the place was like a mall. There's nobody around. And, ah, nobody in there had no much, much to do with an old man 85 years old. And, I went back in the nursing home again. The next thing I know, in July of '86, I came down with pneumonia again. And, ah, when I got out of the hospital, they had made arrangements, the doctor, my daughter, my son, ah, for me to come in here. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN And that's all what happened. And, ah, I was just about as low as you could possibly get in life when that happened when I, when I came in here. And, ah, I had no friends up here. I'd call on my daughter. My daughter's working. So I see her a couple of times a week. But, ah, when I came in here, why, here were a wonderful group of people. And, ah, I have very, took an exercise, took a new interest in life altogether and spent good time with my wife in nursing home right until January when she passed away. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN  So. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN And during that time, you said that there had been no, no professional help. There had been no counselors or other professional people. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN As far as a person who's concerned, no. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. If someone had approached you about counseling, might you have taken advantage of it? 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN  I don't know. I've always been pretty much independent. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN And did most everything on my own. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN And, ah, I don't know. I might have and I might, I would probably be inclined to say no. I probably wouldn't pay too much attention... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN ...to counseling. I don't think I would. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN So, when you kind of hit the bottom where your daughter and your physician said, " Look, Ed, this is what you need to do." (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN You let them take over and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN ...brought you and it was a good... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN When that happened, I said, " Yes". (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN I came over here on a Sunday with my son. I got out of the hospital on Saturday and came over here on Sunday with my son. We looked around the place. Went outside. Initially, when they mentioned the retirement home, I said, "Retirement home? Me? No way!" So we looked around. We came over here on a Saturday and looked around. Sunday, rather. And, ah, we got outside. He got the car and he said, "What do you think of it, Dad?" I said, "It's pretty nice." He said, "When do you wanna move in?" I said, "Monday would be all right." (laughs) 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN That soon enough, huh? 

00:21:20
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Now, let's hear the comments of Ally(ph) who had to give up her possessions in order to move into even smaller quarters than she had planned. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Ally, when you came home from the hospital, and you found the lady had sold your things, what did you do? 

00:21:35
ALLY  Well, I found out before I left the hospital. Neighbors called and said, "Ally(ph), she has sold everything." These things here, I had had put in one room so that she knew to save those things. But my dresses were all sold except for three. Oh, I'd say, two or three thousand dollars, I lost. But, ah, there is a place here called Bailey(ph) House on 13th Street. And, ah, instead of bothering any my friends, I went there for a week. And then, my, I mean, Vans(ph) was ready for me. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. How did you deal with your feelings, about what you've lost? 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN At first, I said some words I maybe had shouldn't have said. (laughs)

UNKNOWN You were angry? 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Yes, very angry. And she and I did a great deal of talking over the telephone. And I thought I would, ah, I'm just not one to take someone to court. But I thought about it and I called my lawyers and a good, dear friend of mine. He said, "Ally(ph), I wouldn't bother with it." 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN "Just leave it alone." 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. And beneath the anger, was there a lot of hurt with the losses that you had? 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN I think I'm over it, that now. Friends were very nice to shop for me. I have one friend in Tallahassee who has set me two most beautiful dresses and she knows how to shop for me. So that, ah, but the way people have treated me has helped me overcome it. It doesn't bother me any longer. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN Doesn't any longer.

DR. TOM SWEENEY What you have observed are the real-life experiences of older persons today, you, too, will be given opportunities to help others plan for their later years. You might ask, what are some of the key topical areas with which I should be knowledgeable? Among them are the following: Financial planning is essential to any client's retirement. While the actual consultation on finances is beyond the scope and confidence of professional counselors, there can be valuable assistance provided through other resources. Among them are estate planners, attorneys, social security and retirement fund representatives. Many people believe that their retirement funds would be sufficient based upon pre-retirement buying power. Many of these same people have had to progressively reduce the quality of their lifestyle because of inflation, increased need for medical treatment and related expenses. In short, counselors can be a catalyst for such planning through deliberate inquiry and exploration. Housing constitutes one of the most critical dimensions of lifestyle. Where one wants to live is often determined by finances, geographical location of family and friends, and health. Some individuals have few choices, others many. In every case, however, individuals seek a place where they can be both physically and emotionally happy and secure. Counselors can help counselees explore the importance which each of these factors plays in reaching their own decision. As will be revealed in other programs in this series, safety needs become increasingly important with age. And their cities tend to have significant challenges in providing pleasant secure environments for their older persons. Elder crime can be expected to increase over time. Government and private businesses, however, are investing in housing for older persons. Equally encouraging are the condominiums and villages being developed and governed by older persons themselves. Within these settings, older persons have the opportunity to develop satisfying peer relationships. Counselors can encourage friendships and peer support through group approaches as reviewed in another video in the series. Health needs of older persons are multiple. Counselors can be most helpful and encouraging preventative practices such as good nutrition, regular exercise and recreation.

3. HEALTH 

00:25:40
DR. TOM SWEENEY  In the case of exercise, researchers demonstrate that all aspects of health can be improved with even moderate consistent effort. The processes of aging can be slowed or in some cases even reversed. Educational interventions for older persons are among the most valuable that the counselors can use for encouragement and continued self sufficiency. One of the most often heard comments among older persons is "I don't feel old inside." They want to keep learning, and they're willing to try.

4. EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS 

00:26:10
DR. TOM SWEENEY  Many older persons need better skill development and assertiveness, emphatic listening and stress management. These are well, well within the realm of counselor competencies. They can directly affect the quality of lifestyle for these individuals and help them cope better with the future circumstances. New friendships can be developed and old ones enriched. Counselors can have a key role in the career and lifestyle planning of older persons. When we define these terms more broadly than gainful employment or leisure activities alone, the full potential for helping becomes apparent. At the present time, there is no other profession as well suited to addressing these needs as counseling. Much remains to be done in the way of career theory for later life. Tools for working with older persons, for example, in the way of career assessment still need developed. Some computer programs are presently under development, however, and will be available in the foreseeable future. All of these bodes good news for counselors and the older persons with which they will work in the future. At least there is now a body of literature growing which addresses these needs. Many of you watching this program today will be among those who further this knowledge base through your work with older persons.
