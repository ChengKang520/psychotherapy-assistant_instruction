JAY HALEY I think the best therapy is based on the assumption that if you don't give a directive you don't get a change, that conversation doesn't change people unless there's a directive implicit in it. For example, uh, it helps to, to realize that you can't not give a directive, as a matter of fact, that, uh, that it's difficult to get training in doing directives but you are going to do them whether you like or not. You know, one of the ways to think about it is, if you take the most non-directive therapists, like Carl Rogers, who argued that you should only reflect back to people, you shouldn't tell them what to do. Well, if you watch him at work or a film, you see that he doesn't reflect everything back. He reflects certain things back. And as he reflects certain things back, you can see the client producing more and more of the material in that area and it's, a directive therapist would say he was indirectly encouraging the person to talk in this certain area. He wouldn't see it that way. He would see himself as only reflective. But it's in the nature of human relations and communications that you can't not give a directive. That is, Batesman (ph) used to say, uh, that every message is both a report and a command. It's a report about your nature, or whatever, but it's a command of the other person to think about you in a certain way or to react in a certain way or, it's, that it's implicit in every, uh, in every comment, every message. So if you think about that, then you think I might as well be directive. Then you have the problem of where you gonna learn to give directives? Uh, it's still, uh, not taught by most supervisors. Uh, I mean, there are a number now who are but, uh, the supervisors come from another tradition and so it's hard for them to make the change. There's a kind of an inertia that comes over people when it comes to giving directives. Therapy was always so easy. If you could say to people tell me more about that, that's about all you had to do, and then, how do you feel about telling me more about that? But you didn't have to do anything. Once you learn how to do something then you're into a decision whether to take it easy and just reflect with people, or to get 'em all, to, to do a directive therapy you have to get people organized, a family or an individual. You have to get them organized, get them motivated, You have to give the directive. You have to make sure they understand it. You have to, uh, deal with it if they don't follow it. Uh, there's a whole variety of things that have to be done around giving a directive and, uh, it's just easier to say tell me more about that really. But the problem is, the problems aren't going away and they're not going away rapidly if you do that. So it's helpful to learn how to do it, a therapy, with, that's directive. One of the things about it is you can help yourself with this inertia to go just into a more passive state. One of the ways you can do it is get the family to organize you. Once you realize your feelings are in other people's hands, then you begin to, uh, think how to organize people to influence yourself. But for example, uh, you can say to a, a family or an individual, would you like to change and they'll say, in the first interview say, and they'll say, well that's why I'm here, but that may not be why they're here. See, it's curious how many therapists don't ask people if they want to change. Once you ask them, and if they say yes, then you've got a commitment. You have a right to do kinds of things to change them because they've asked for it. If you never, uh, ask that question, you just sort of slide into therapy without it clear what it's about. But if you say, uh, would you like to change, and they say yes, then you say would you like to change quickly or would you like to change slowly and they choose which would they like. Some are in a hurry, some don't care how long it takes them. Then you can say, um, would you like to know what I'm doing to change you or is it all right if you don't know what I'm doing? And some will say I want to know everything you're doing and others don't care. But you have a series of questions like that. Uh, you, you can say would you like to notice you're changing, when you're changing, or just one day realize you've changed. And if you do this, you can even, you can even add the traditional one of, are you willing to do anything, to make any sacrifice to change? And they'll say, well what kind of a sacrifice? And you'll say well anything that's necessary. And they'll say well there are certain things perhaps but not others. But once you do that and then you deal with the people, they expect you to do something, to ask them for a sacrifice or to change them quick. That is you've used them to force yourself to do something, because they're sitting there expecting you to do something. And it helps, uh, get yourself organized and required to do it. They, they turn to you for action, and you need to do that. But one of the things that's important, I think, is that a, a directive begins when you say hello to a client. It doesn't begin when you give the directive. That, uh, if you interview people and its clear that you're interested and concerned and empathetic and wanna help them, and, uh, you're understanding what's upsetting them about the problem, then, uh, I think they'll do what you say because they figure you understand and you know what you're doing. If you don't have a good relationship with them, then giving a directive isn't going to achieve much of anything. It's a, uh, you know, one way to think about it is the directive is a way of dealing with the client. It, uh, the purpose of it is not to get directive followed. It's to have a process of talking with the client. It's like in Zen, which interested me and had a big influence on me. It's, uh, Zen Buddhism is a procedure where a master is, changes a trainee in a one to one relationship, uh, and is about 700 years old, that procedure. So they're pretty experienced people, but they don't do it with a conversation. The master teaches the trainee some activity like swordsmanship, or the Tea Ceremony, or flower arranging and the enlightenment comes in the process of those two working together around this, this new task and I think directives are like that, that you, instead of talking about the past or motivation, you talk, you give a directive and talk about the response to the directive. An example I like is one of Erickson's where he had a, a woman come in with her 50 year old son, and she said her problem was her son just hung on her all the time and wouldn't leave her alone. She couldn't even read a book because he nagged at her all the time. And, uh, so Erickson told the woman to get in her car with the young, with her son and to drive out into the desert and to push her son out of the car. See, she was stronger then this guy, and push him out of the car and to drive one mile and park and sit in that air conditioned car and read her book. And he, she, he said your son will be angry and jumping up and down, but it's hot out there, and he's gonna walk, and the exercise will be good for him, and he's gonna walk to the car. So the woman did it, and the guy walked to the car. And the next day the woman did it again, and the guy walked to the car. And then they came in to see Eriscson and the guy said, isn't there some other exercise I could do besides walking in that hot desert, and Erickson said well, what do you have in mind, um, and the guy said, uh, couldn't we go bowling, and I'll bowl while mother sits up in the stands and reads her book. Erickson said that would be fine. And he did a series of tasks like that with this mother and her 50 year old son, without any discussion of how they got the way they are or what the purposes were or what the motivation was. But as he gives the tasks, they then talk about the tasks, and it gives them a way of relating around that instead of, uh, instead of motivation or something like that. So it, uh, it's an interesting kind of, uh, idea that, that you need to have a way of working with people and that their change comes in relation to that way of working with you, you know, and, and more then conversation can be involved. Well let me say a little bit about directives. Uh, I think there's are generally two types of directives. One is straightforward, where you just tell people what to do and the other is more indirect, where, uh, you restrain people from changing or you use paradoxes or you bring in a whole family to change one person, but you work more indirectly. 00:09:50]And it's a, uh, it's a question which to use and I think which to use depends on your power, your authority. That is, if a man comes in and he's drinking too much and beating his wife, and you say don't drink so much, and don't beat your wife, and he doesn't. He doesn't beat his wife and he doesn't drink so much, you've got it made. I mean a straightforward directive like that and it's solved. If he comes in and he says, for some reason this week I beat my wife more than usual and I drank more than usual, then you know a straightforward directive isn't going to affect this guy, that you have to go at this in a more indirect way. And you have the problem that so many, uh, symptoms are people saying I can't help myself. So if you tell them directly to do something they say I can't do it because I can't help myself and you then need to go more indirectly. But a lot of it depends on your authority, uh, in doing a variety of kinds of straightforward directives. But it's, uh, you have to get accustomed, I think, to the idea that you can give directives, that times have changed, particularly if you're gonna do a brief therapy. That giving a person directive and having them do something doesn't make them more dependent on you, uh, necessarily at all, you can handle this in various ways. But let me say a little bit about what the straightforward directives are, that, well one is advice. You know, it used to be that you couldn't give a client advice. If they asked for advice you would say, I wonder why you asked me that, you know? But you couldn't just say here's a good idea. And I think nowadays you can give advice, that there's a, for example, there's a lot of young people who feel they can't listen to their parents because their parents are out of date. Everything's changing so fast. So they look for a contemporary expert like a therapist and go to them and ask for advice, and I think you should give it if you have it to give, and hopefully wise advice. But, uh, it's surprising what reasons people come in. I remember a couple who came in with a little kid and they wanted to have him examined to know if he was intellectually prepared for nursery school. And the therapist examined the kid and examined the parents and concluded, uh, that the kid was ready for nursery school and off they went. Now I think that was a service. You know, they wanted some advice about their kid, is he ready or isn't he? And, uh, in the old days, you just wouldn't do that at all. You would only be puzzled with them what their motivations were for doing this. But anyhow I think giving advice is a good idea. Another straightforward directive is coaching people. Where you, uh, if you have a wife you coach her how to win her husband back or you coach the husband how to win his wife back or you coach an adolescent how to get more concessions from the parents. I mean coaching is a legitimate enterprise. It means that you give, that people pose a problem, you make a suggestion, they start to carry it out, you watch them carrying it out and advise them doing it and make any changes that seem necessary to achieve whatever it is they're trying achieve. There's no reason why you can't do that, I think. There's another, uh, set of straightforward directives which are ordeals. There's a very good book on that subject. It has a theory and it has case examples and all. It's, uh, it's an idea of a person, whenever he has a symptom, doing something that's harder on him than the symptom and if he does that, the symptom will go away. Seems oversimple, but it's that simple. Uh, it either works or it doesn't work, and when it works, it works very rapidly. But you, uh, you often set it up with them. It's a straightforward deal. In fact you explain to them that if you do something deliberately that's harder on you then the symptom you'll give it up and what do you think would be harder on you then the symptom? It should be something that's good for them, so that they win either way. If they go through the ordeal it's good for them. If they get over the symptom it's good for them. As an example, this is an, an Erickson technique, I had a boy who was, uh, 17 years old wetting the bed and he was about to go to college and he couldn't sleep in a dormitory and wet the bed, so he wanted to get over it. So I asked him what was, uh, and I talked him about his life and he liked to exercise, so I asked him what was a long walk, and he said a mile was a long walk. And he had told me, uh, that what he does is wake in the night with a wet bed, change the sheets, and go back to sleep, every night. So I told him that when he woke up in the night with a wet sheet, he had to, uh, go out and walk for a mile and then come back and climb into bed with that wet sheet and, uh, sleep till morning and if he did that every night he'd get over this. So he went on and he did it and he began to wet the bed. In a matter of days, he began to wet less, and then it was once a week and then he stopped. And, uh, it's an ordeal. It was harder on him to get up in the night and then come back and lie in that wet bed, then it was to stop wetting the bed. So he stopped. But what I found was that apparently his parents called me, said they'd like to see me, and I was in those days thinking well he had a problem I solved. They had a problem, I'll help them. Never occurred to me they had a problem because he had a problem. So I saw them and the kid had just gone off to college and they weren't getting along very well at all. And the boy did an interesting thing and I think often an ordeal gives a people a, uh, a spirit to do more. But what he did was go to college and refuse to come home for a month. And then at the end of the month, he came home, brought his laundry, had dinner, and integrated in the family. But he made his own disengagement process. And I think he did that partly because he was given a way of solving his own problem, you know. So ordeals are very helpful. There's a whole variety of them. There's another, uh, straightforward directive and that's penance, to give somebody a penance. This has been around for centuries probably, uh, and it can be used in therapy. If you have a couple in which one of them had an affair and isn't anymore but there's a bitterness that the couple can't get over, uh, to have the, the villain do a, a penance is often very helpful. You say to the wife, is there anything your husband can do that would make it up to you for this and, uh, she can usually think of something. But once she sets something and he does it, she has to forgive him. I mean, that has, they have to get past it. It's a ritual that helps them get past bitterness like that. There's also people who do awful things, or did awful things and feel terribly guilty about it and you can only do so much talking to them about how terribly guilty they feel about it . I think it's helpful to have them do a penance to make up for what they did. Preferably to go off and do good deeds for somebody in relation to their problem. And it can be done secretly, they don't have to do it publicly. But as they do something positive, then the terrible thing they did has a positive outcome ultimately. And so the penance is very useful for that, and the community can benefit from whatever they do. So penance is, is a powerful one. Usually the straightforward directives, uh, are used in, in structural kinds of changes. If you put a father in charge of his son instead of the mother or you put a mother in charge instead of the father or whatever structural kinds of arrangements you make are straightforward directives. I want you to do such and such this week. So there's a whole variety in the straightforward. So let me say a little about indirect ones and then show one. The, uh, the indirect ones almost all, uh, involve restraining people from changing because if you tell them to change they're not going to anyhow. And it can be that, uh, you do it generally or you can do it (inaudible ) with a paradox. You can do it generally by saying I think I can help you over this problem, but I'm not sure you're ready for it, to be normal like other people. And, uh, therefore, uh, let's not hurry about this, and they say, I'm ready to be normal, and you say well you think you are, but you can't be sure. For example, if I help you over this problem. you'll have more self esteem and more confidence because you solved a difficult problem, and I'm not sure you could tolerate that. And they'll say I can tolerate that, and you say, well could your husband tolerate that, uh, if you were more self assertive? We have to think about these consequences. And you can, what you do really is outline what you see anyhow when people change, the consequences with them and other people. You just present it as a warning. You can have them go home and make a list of the changes. I had one couple, the wife was bulimic, and they went home and came back with, uh, three single-spaced typed written pages of the consequences if she stops throwing up and it was interesting how carefully they thought the whole thing through. Then you do something to stop it and, uh, then you go over with them are these consequences happening, you know, and that becomes the follow up. But it's a, uh, it's the same thing with paradox. Paradox just means what they came to get over you encourage them to have and it's such a simple technique but it isn't so simple to carry out well. That is, some people will encourage a symptom, the person will improve a little, the therapist will say that's fine, the person will relapse, and then the therapist will say well paradox doesn't work. Actually, uh, you, there's a series of stages in paradox. You have to formulate the problem clearly, you have to encourage them to do it, you have to get some improvement, and then condemn them for not having more improvement. If somebody is supposed to have a miserable time on Monday and they come in and they didn't have a miserable time and they were sort of miserable but not really, then you say well you're not cooperating. You've gotta be really miserable. And you would give them, uh, two days instead of just one day, so they'll have more time to be miserable, or you can extend it a week. And you get into relationships where you're insisting they feel badly and they're insisting they won't, or don't want to. You can do it with individuals, you can do it with symptoms, you can do it with couples, you can do it with families. Couples who bicker all the time and can't get anything settled, you can have them pick a time, like Monday evening from 8-10 where they're to bicker and not get anywhere, to get a full understanding of it. And they'll go and they won't do it. They'll start to laugh or they'll get mad or, people like to make their own misery. They don't like somebody else making their misery. It's the high class scientific background for this technique really, uh, and it's an interesting, uh, procedure. You can do it for a straight symptom or you can do it for a theme in the person's life. For example, Erickson had a, uh, boy who was picking at the sore on his forehead to where it was ulcerated and the parents had tried everything. The father broke his bicycle and broke his bow and arrow and made him restricted him and all sorts of things. And the boy kept right on. They put bandages on it and he put his finger under the bandages. So they brought him to Erickson, and, uh, one of the rules of paradox is you don't encourage anybody to harm themselves or encourage them to do anything to immoral or improper, really. And so Erickson wouldn't encourage the boy to pick at that sore. What he did was say to the boy that he was gonna help him cure his own sore, and the way he was going to cure it was he was going to devote Saturday morning to writing 1,000, he needed improvement in his handwriting. Erickson always checked the kids handwriting and he needed improvement, so Erickson said he was to, on Saturday morning, he was to write 1,000 times, "I do not think it is a good idea to pick at the sore on my forehead." And they boy was not too enthusiastic about this task but Erickson said that while you're doing that, your father will do all your chores and you can go out and supervise him, make sure he does them properly. There was a whole series of things the boy was usually doing on Saturday, and the boy liked that idea. So he sat on Saturday mornings and wrote this out, and the father said he had to really do the chores properly, uh, 'cuz the boy came out and supervised him. And, uh, what happened is the boys handwriting improved remarkably but the sore cleared up and Erickson argued it wasn't encouraging the symptom, it was encouraging a theme in the boy's life. He obsessionally was picking at the sore, so you give him something else to obsessionally do, like writing something 1,000 times, and he does that instead of picking at the sore, which I thought was an interesting way to think about it. So there's a lot of variety in, uh, in ways you can do it. You also need to expect trouble or something unusual when you use paradox because you get a real reaction in some cases, in most cases. And for example, I had a, I was dealing with a series of agoraphobic wives, and treating them was a couple problems, which I think is sensible. And I, the, this fireman brought in his wife who hadn't been out of the house for years. She could go out with her mother or with him but she couldn't go out alone. So he had to take the kids to school, and take 'em to the doctor and all this sort of thing. And he had enough. He said he wanted her cured so he brought her in. So I suggested, uh, there was something they could do and that they would think it was silly and you say that so they don't say it's silly, you know, because you've already said it's silly. And I said I wanted him, when he went to work the next morning, to tell his wife to stay home. And he knew his wife was gonna stay home. She hadn't been out in years, but he should tell her that, and, and she was present when we said this, and he said okay and she said okay. And the next morning he told her to stay home, and it was funny, "ha-ha" they laughed about it. The next morning he told her to stay home, it wasn't so funny. And the third morning he told her to stay home, she went out of the house to the grocery store for the first time in seven years. And when they came in at the next session, it was a very upset husband saying if my wife goes out alone, where is she gonna go, and what is she gonna do? And the wife said, I've always said if I could leave this house, I'd leave with my suitcase in my hand. So you're right into a break up of a marriage if you're not careful. Erickson developed it in a variety of ways. One of the ones he liked to do that I always liked is he would take a couple who couldn't talk about something, like sex. They wanted to do some changing about it but they couldn't talk about it, so he would say to them that he wanted them to talk about other things and he wanted to talk to them about having dinner together, and how very important it is that a couple enjoy dinner together. The wife should enjoy the dinner, the husband should enjoy the dinner. And he asked them how they have dinner. Do they have it, do they have it by candle light, or do they do it just anywhere in the house? And, uh, then he says do you like appetizers to start the juices flowing or do you like to dive right into the meat and potatoes? And he does the thing on dinner to parallel sex, and I guess if they become aware of it at all, you should drop it or change because they're, this is to work outside their awareness and, uh, which is where part of the ethical issue comes from. And you should also do one more thing that many, uh, people don't know and that is, you need to take a position yourself. You need to say it's important that you enjoy dinner together. Everybody should, every couple should enjoy dinner together. That is, you don't just comment, you, you take a position and say what ought to be done. At any rate, if you do that correctly the couple will come in and have, uh, made some changes, uh, in their sexual relations and will think they originated that. They think they initiated it and you think you initiated it, but who knows who initiated it. But it's an interesting way of working that you should take some practice with. There's a couple of other indirect techniques. One of 'em is doing nothing. That, uh, you know, Karl Menninger wrote a book on psychoanalysis and he said the curative factor in analysis was frustration, that the patient comes expecting the analyst to do something and the analyst doesn't do anything and out of frustration the patient begins to take some action in his or her life, which is an interesting, one of the few social theories of, uh, of psychoanalysis that I know of. At any rate, you can do nothing and we just wait people out. I remember one time watching Erickson give a demonstration of hypnosis and he asked, he said he wanted to demonstrate resistance to hypnosis so would somebody come up and resist him, which is an odd thing to ask to begin with. The person has to cooperate by resisting him. But a young man came up and stood in front of Erickson, and Erickson stood there and the young man went in the trance, Erickson didn't do anything. And I was sitting in the first row and I was curious, always, about how he did what he did. So afterwards I said to him, what did you do to hypnotize that young man? And he said I didn't do anything. And I said you must have done something, I saw him go in a trance standing there. And Erickson said no, uh, the young man came up in front of all those people and somebody had to do something and I wasn't doing anything so he went into a trance. It's an interesting way of using an audience, but if you do nothing in a situation where somebody has to do something, then they'll do it and you, and then they've spontaneously done it which is, uh, what you're after in therapy, is to get a spontaneous change, not a change just because you tell people to change. There's another, uh, set of tasks and that's absurd task, which are very good for rational people, scientific people, who are, are so rational. As an example, I used to, uh, when I was in practice, deal with this space scientist out in California, who are very rational people, men and women. In fact there were so many rational men that, that we called, we had a thing we called the engineer syndrome, which was a very rational husband and a very emotional wife, and the more emotional she got, the more rational he got and the more rational he got, the more emotional she got. So they escalated in that way. And if you get a, a very rational scientist, and you give a directive, he thinks it over and says, well I understand why you're doing that and what purpose it serves so I don't need to do that. And he thinks through everything you're saying and has an answer for anything you might suggest, but he can't stand absurdity. So something I learned from Erickson, I would, there was a mountain near where I was with a little winding road going up to it to an observatory, and I said to this scientist, I did it with several, but a particular bright man, a man so bright he was the only man in his department 'cuz nobody else could understand him. He was a very lonely fella. And everything I suggested he had a reason why it wasn't necessary to do that. But anyhow I said to him that I wanted him to go to that road up that mountain and I wanted him to drive, drive 7.3 miles, and then to get out of the car and find a reason for being there. And they'll always do it. They have to go to find a reason for being there. Erickson would send them out in the desert 1.2 miles and find a reason for being there, and they always find a reason. I mean they see a view, or they have a flower, or there's a fresh breeze they hadn't ever noticed before or something. But when they come back, they're different. They behave with you differently in therapy. They're looser in their thinking, and they're not so rational. It has a curious effect. It does something to the brain, I think. So absurd tasks you can give. In particular, ones people have to do to find out the result, because, uh, they don't know what the result could be because its so absurd. At any rate, those are most of the indirect directives. And, uh, they're required when a straightforward, telling people how to do differently and change their life just doesn't work.
