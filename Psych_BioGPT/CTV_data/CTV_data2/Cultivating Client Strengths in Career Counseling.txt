REBECCA E. MICHEL I'm Dr. Becky Michel, and I'm a faculty member at Governors State University. And today I'm going to share with you about positive psychology and incorporating strengths into career counseling. You're at a job interview, you feel great, you get up early, you went on a run, you danced to some music, you look sharp, you get called in, your hands start sweating, you start questioning yourself, "Do I know what I'm supposed to say here?" You tell yourself, "Yes, I do. This is the job that I want and this is the job that I'm going to get." You sit down and they ask you, "Sir/madam, tell me about yourself." You think, "Oh, thank goodness. A question I can answer." You tell them about your job history and about how you're going to be contributing value to the organization. You find ways to weave in things that you've studied about their mission and their values as an organization. Then they throw a question at you that you don't feel as prepared to ask. They say, "Tell me about your strengths," and you freeze. You're like a deer in headlights, and you think, "I can tell you all about my weaknesses, I can tell you about the things that I don't do well, but that probably won't get me hired. So what are my strengths?" This is a question, in some format that is asked in just about every job interview that you'll go to. And it's a question that most people in our society really, really struggle with. So today we're going to be talking about how to answer that question, "What are my strengths?" So that the next time that you're at a job interview, you can really get that job by answering that question very, very well. Today we're going to talk about a few different terms. And the first is going to be talents versus strengths. These are terms that have been defined by the Gallup Institution. And Gallup, as you may know, studies people. They study… They put out tests and they put out assessments and they find out what makes people tick. And so, for the past 30 years, the Gallup Institution has studied people at their best. And they have come up with lots of different ways to be able to find out how we can infuse talent and strength into people's work. So talent is a naturally reoccurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be applied productively. We all possess talents, we're born with them, they're innate and they stay with us our entire lives. And they can be developed or ignored. So just because you have a talent, doesn't mean that you have to nurture it at all. Some examples might be empathy, so somebody who can really talk to another person, and it truly feels like they understand what's going on in that other person's shoes, sometimes empathy is a trait that many people in the helping fields often possess. Another might be assertiveness, this might… You might see this talent among people who are in the sales industry, right? So think about the last time that you went maybe to purchase a car. I don't know, if any of you have had that lovely experience lately, but, you know, the last time I was in, probably about two years ago, I went into the car dealership, I was just looking of course, and the salesperson comes right up, shakes my hand, very, very assertive, very confident and finds me a car that I walk out the parking lot with and spend way too much money on, right? And so that person, they were assertive, they were confident, they… They may have faked it, but at the end of the day, they probably just had that talent of assertiveness. And it works for them in their career and in their life. And then competitiveness, you can think about this, just in general maybe with people who are in sports, right? People who are maybe top executives within companies, people who like to play games to win. Not just for the fun of playing the game. So again, these are talents. We all have them. They can be named lots of different things, but it's important to know that everybody in all societies has talents. So next, and this is all from Gallup. Gallup next classifies a strength as the ability to consistently perform a specific task at a nearly perfect level. So strengths are defined by actual activities and right… And there a specific task and we'll, I'll be explaining a lot more about this. So strengths are comprised of three components. Those three components are talents, which we just talked about. Those are the innate abilities that we each have, empathy, assertiveness, competitiveness. Skills, these skills can be learned, right? We all learn skills in various different ways. So you might think about, "Okay, when was the last time that I did something that I really was doing for the first time?" Another car, example. I was driving home from visiting some friends and family, about a month ago, and… driving, driving, driving, bah-bum, bah-bum, bah-bum… What happens? I get a flat tire. So, pulled over the side of the road and I had to pretty quickly learn the skill of changing a tire. You would think, you know, at my age I would know that by now, but I didn't. So what did I do? I pulled out the owner's manual of my car, right? I called AAA right away and then I call the road side assistance people to come and… I was out on the middle of the road, and changing that tire and the gentleman with the large light comes and shines it on me. He comes and says, "You've got this, I'm gonna go home now." Right? And so I was learning a very new skill about changing a tire, and I did lots of different things to do it. And so again, you kind of think throughout our whole lives we learned so many different skills, and we can learn them, you know, in formal education. We can learn them just by going through life. We can learn them by reading books. We can learn them by watching others, you know, with mirror neurons. So those are the skills. And then knowledge is also learned. And so these are… These are more book facts. So what are… You know, somebody might have a counseling theory of cognitive behavioral therapy, right? And so what are the major tenants of CBT? What knowledge do I need to know in order to really, appropriately conceptualize and work with these clients? So that's more of the knowledge. Skills are the ability to practice, and to be able to practice and achieve an outcome. Knowledge is the background information that you need in order to really do that well. And so according to Gallup, the strengths equation is talent, our innate abilities, times the investment. And the investment is the knowledge and the skills. So it times the investment that we spent is equal to a strength. And so again, a strength is the ability to consistently perform a specific task at a nearly perfect level. We'll be talking more about this. So here is just a chart that can break this up a little bit 'cause sometimes these words, are words that, you know, if you are not really familiar with this strength language, that can be a little bit challenging for people to grasp at first. So talents, where do they come from? They're innate. We're born with them. Do you have a choice in how they're applied? They're automatic. There is no choice about having it. We just… We can have a choice though whether or not we want to actually utilize it and nurture that talent. And then strengths, where do they come from? These are developed through practice, persistence, learning, dedication, right? And do you have a choice in how they're applied? They're voluntary. You have choices about where you use it, whether or not you want to develop the strength more. And then whether or not you even want to acquire it in the first place. So that's overview of talents and strengths. And talents are not easy to identify, and there is lots and lots of reasons for that. For one, talents are automatic. Again, remember these are innate talents within us. So they are just something that we naturally do. We may not even really consider it special. For example, somebody who has really strong communication skills, they might be really strong writers, they might be good at speaking orally and they may be able to get up and give a presentation in class and just nail it, right? And they might assume that all the other peers in their class can do the same, because it's just really easy for them, right? And anybody whose given presentations who doesn't have this skill knows that's not always the case, right? So talents are automatic. So you may not even realize it's a talent because it's just something that you are naturally able to do very easily. Another challenge of identifying talents, especially in our society, is that talents may be criticized. So I'm going to talk in a few minutes about different ways to classify talents. But one that Gallup mentions is a talent called, "woo," and woo means, according to Gallup, is the ability to win others over. So this is the person who, you're at a party, you're at a social event, you know, you're at mixer, and this is the person who is talking to everyone, they are the social butterfly. And they love to meet people, shake their hand, talk to them, be in a genuine conversation and then move right along to the next person. And keep doing that. And they, they are very, very energized by that, right? Well, that talent sometimes is not always embraced by people. And I've had people that I worked with that are in partnerships, for example, and the one partner has a strong woo, they really love connecting with people, they really love chatting with people to become… they see a group of new people and they see them as instant potential friends, right? However, their partner might not have that woo characteristic. And so they get irritated every time they go to a party or every time they go to a function, and who's the one, the last one to leave, who is the one shaking everybody's hand, but their partner who has woo. So they get home and it's, "We're the last ones to leave again. Did you have to talk to everyone, right?" So you can see this happening and you can see that may be instead of that person really celebrating that woo strength, that partner is criticizing it. And so, that might not be something that somebody would identify as a strength or a talent if it's criticized. So another aspect of why this is challenging is that thinking about talents may seem boastful. In our society, it's so interesting because we're… In the western society, we're very individualistic and yet it's important for us to be, or at least pretend to be, very modest, okay. So you think about that. You think about, umm… the example at the beginning where I ask… where the person was asked in a job interview, "Tell me about your strengths." And they clamped up, right? So we've been taught that talking about our strengths and our talents seems boastful, that, you know, we want to be good at something, however, we don't want to brag about it. We don't want to seem like we are too good, right? So thinking about our talents may seem boastful in our society. And it may not be something that's really encouraged. Also, another challenge of identifying talents and then strengths is that people have few places to learn about their talents. So think about in school, umm… when you… may be when you were in school, or if you have children or young people who are in your life, and they bring home a report card. And let's say that there are three As, two Bs and one C. What are you likely to focus on? Probably the C, right? Most people. And so it's, "How can I get this C to B and A, you know? Come on. What you're doing, Frank?" Right? We need to get this C and A. Instead of focusing on the strengths, the As, "Wow! You got an A in PE class and you got in A in Spanish. Frank, that is fantastic. Now, what are you doing in those classes that's making you achieve so well? How can we apply that to that C so that we can make that into, even though it's not something that you love, that geometry, how can we use your skills to be… that you've used to be successful in those other two classes, to be able to boost your skills in geometry, alright?" So we have few places to learn about our talents. Oftentimes in school, we're criticized and we are devalued for not achieving well. We also might wish we had different talents. And so since these are innate, we see other people and we realize, "Okay, that person is a very competitive person. And I can see that they are… They get what they want, right? And I'm not competitive at all. So I think that that's a more effective talent than what I have." Which is may be harmony, for example, and getting along with others. And so we might wish we had different talents. So if you think about it, most of us have dominant hand. Some of us are ambidextrous, but most of us have a dominant hand. And so if you could just kind of raise your dominant hand, all right, and think about… Thank you, that's good. So you can think about when you sign your name using your dominant hand, it looks pretty darn good. You've had a lot of years to practice signing your name, right? But if you, you know, fall and get a sprain or workout too hard and can't really use that arm, you may have to use your other hand. And anyone who's ever tried to do this has tried to sign your name with your non-dominant hand. And how does it look? It barely legible, right? You can't really see it. And so, usually… And so the idea of strengths and talents is like this. We have used our talent of writing, and it has become a strength to us. We've been able to write our name for many years. We've invested that natural talent, those… The knowledge and the skills to do that with our dominant hand. With our non-dominant hand, we haven't developed that, we haven't invested the time in it. So it's really, it's not an area of strength. It's an area of weakness for us. And so of course, we can spend time, you know, three hours a day, practicing your signature with your non-dominant hand. But what's the use of that? It just seems like a waste of time to me. Why not just keep doing what you are doing well and figure out how to continue to do that? And so that's the difference between focusing on your weaknesses, which you are not doing well, and focusing on your strengths. And so why do we want to cultivate client strengths? This can be important from the employers, the employees and the organizational perspective. So for an employer, so if somebody who is hiring the individual, you want to find somebody who knows themselves and who can add value to the company, right? For the employee, you want to be able find a job that is meaningful to you where you can use your knowledge and skills to be able to exceed. People who are using their knowledge and skills in a way that they can use their strengths are much more satisfied in their work and in their life than people who don't utilize their strengths. And then from an organizational standpoint, when you can match people who have strengths and assets in one area with a job, then there is a good organizational fit. It's what in the book "Good to Great", there is an example about finding the right person in the right seat on the bus, all right? And so that example shows how it can be beneficial for an organization to help cultivate strengths. So there's many, many different ways to identify client strengths and career counseling. And one of them is through career assessments. And so one of these career assessments that I'm going to talk about for a couple of minutes today was developed by Gallup and it's called "StrengthsFinder." And what this is, is it's an assessment that takes about 30 minutes to complete, and you go through the assessment and you indicate on a continuum whether or not you're more or less like a certain description. So I like… It's kind of like if anybody has taken the Myers Briggs personality assessment, somewhat like that. I enjoy spending time outdoors to I enjoy organizing things in my office, okay. So the tough thing is that… Sometimes you really like both of those. And this assessment, you have to answer the questions really fast so that it tries to get a clear picture of who you really are. And so you indicate yourself on that continuum. And what the StrengthsFinder does is… it gives you your result, your top five signature strengths. And I mentioned woo earlier, that's one of them. There are 34 of these signature strengths from adaptability, analytical, competitiveness, command, all the way down to woo. And each of these strengths are ubiquitous. So these are strengths and talents actually that are found in cultures throughout the world. These have been studied by Gallup researchers for, you know, over 30 years. And what they did was they interviewed top performers, they interviewed people who are at their best in their jobs, in their careers, in their life, right? And they figured out what is it that they're doing that makes them tick. And they came with this assessment to be able to help people learn more about themselves. So with this assessment, you can… There are endless possibilities of what you can do with this assessment. And if you go to, you know, strengthsfinder.com or StrengthsQuest, there are many different resources that you can utilize with your clients in order to help them identify and then to be able to utilize their strengths in a really meaningful way. Another career assessment that you can use is just asking people thinking about themselves at their best. So give them a questionnaire. This is a really nice thing to do at the beginning of counseling when you're just getting to know someone. Rather than answering a depression inventory about all the times they felt kept crappy over the past few years, think about when they felt their best. So the time I was at my best. The best thing about me, my most fulfilling experience, the things I like best about myself. And use this information as a starting point to guide your therapy sessions. And then there is another example of the reflected best self exercise, and this was developed by researchers at the University of Michigan. And it is a comprehensive assessment that's done where you… it's kind of like doing a 360 evaluation, in some ways, in your life, by looking at how do people around you perceive yourself. And so you, you ask other people to give you stories about yourself at your best, specific stories and examples. And then you utilize those stories, analyze them to create a portrait of your best self. And this is a wonderful exercise for people who lack self-esteem, who lack self-awareness, may be who just need a little boost, and to be able feel more connectedness into their lives. So again, the reflective best self exercises are very, very helpful exercise as well. And there is many different ways that we can then cultivate these client strikes with in career counseling. So first, we have to identify them the strengths. We've… I gave you several different tools that you can utilize to do that. Next, we have to cultivate them. And in order to do that, we need to help clients find ways to use their strengths in their daily life. So, you know, you go to the supermarket and you have a difficult time making decisions. How can we use your command, strength, in order to make a decision, work around the challenge with that and be able to successfully choose the best fruit for your family for that week, okay? And that's just one simple silly example of this. But you help people identify their strengths to be able to work around their areas of weakness in their careers and in their lifestyles. So research shows that people who are able to utilize their strengths everyday are much more satisfied at work. And people whose supervisors who recognize their strengths are going to be more committed and engaged in their workplace than people who… than supervisors who ignore their strengths or who focus on their weaknesses. And so I want you to just think about your current or most recent job. Can you answer these questions honestly? I enjoy what I do in my position. I'm valued for my contributions. I get along with my co-workers. My supervisor supports my development. I can use my talents at work. And at work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday. Now you've… You answered no to any of those questions, you might actually be seeking employment elsewhere. And that may find you at your next job interview or I hope you can have the skills to be able to speak a little bit more confidently about your strengths. Thank you very much. And now I'll take time, if there is any for some questions. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN I have a question. I was wondering the job interview process can be very rejecting. So as you were talking about asking the client the best times in their life. What do you do if they're having a difficult time thinking of those great times? 

00:24:00
REBECCA E. MICHEL That's such an important question. Because usually, when we find people in counseling, they are usually not at the best time in their life, right? We're usually working with people who have been dejected, who have unsatisfying jobs right now, who maybe have been chronically unemployed. And so these are the most important people to be utilizing these assessments with and these techniques with. Because if you think about it, most of us have had tough times throughout our life, and during those tough times, you know, as you mentioned, maybe, you know, we haven't done our best at an interview. We haven't gotten a job that we wanted. Things don't seem to be going well. We don't feel great. And so we need people, I think to help us lift our spirits a bit and recognize the things that we have done well in our lives because I'm the belief… I have the belief that all of us have been successful in some areas of their life. And now it's just the counselor's job to help dig and find that. And so, you know, you mentioned what do we do when somebody has gone to job interviews, they are not doing well. You are trying to help them, tone in their skills, you're trying to help them talk about what they do well. Well, I mentioned earlier the reflective best self exercise. And this is, I would say, one of the most positive and helpful techniques for people who are really down on themselves. Because what it does again is, you know, I would send out a request to people in my life, people in that I have met in my organizations, in my civic organizations, people I've met in the job place, supervisors, people who have supervised, people within religious organizations, neighbors, children, family members. So you want to create a list of, you know, 15 to 30 people and you send a request to them, you say, "You know, my counselor is having me complete this reflected best self exercise, and in it I need to collect from you three stories about when I was at my best. So these are times that I was successful, that there was a challenge and I was able to use my strengths to overcome them." And each person needs to send three of those stories. And, you know, not everybody is going to respond, right? But you'd be amazed at how many people do respond, and to that individual who is down on their luck and feeling like they can't get a job, and feeling like things are looking hopeless, it is amazing how powerful that information from the people who know them the best can be in helping them to identify, "Yeah, you know, I really… I have been successful. These are the qualities that would make me attractive to an employer, you know? I am really organized. I am a dedicated employee. I do practice organizational behaviors that allow me to really thrive in the workplace." And so that helps people to build their confidence, in an appropriate way, of course, to be able to go into an interview to speak more clearly by providing specific examples about how they've used their strengths in the past. And so hopefully, that answers your question a little bit. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:27:50
REBECCA E. MICHEL Thanks. Okay, is there time for any other questions? 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN I have one more. 

00:27:50
REBECCA E. MICHEL Sure. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Umm… in the StrengthsFinder that you mentioned, umm… what does it identify? 

00:27:55
REBECCA E. MICHEL Yes, absolutely. Great question. So StrengthsFinder again. This is just one of many different assessments that can be utilized. And what it does is that identifies what your natural talents are. So it really probably should be called talent finder, but that was probably too confusing for people. So it identifies what your talents are. And so, for example, somebody might have a talent of being an achiever. They are person who likes to get things done. They have a to-do list. They love checking off the to-do list, they feel very accomplished when they have gotten as many things done on their to-do list as possible. And so, this is a person who has a natural tendency to like to get things done. And so what the StrengthsFinder does is it identifies these five, what they call signature themes, these five talent areas. And then it also provides you with a wealth of resources online and in the books in order to cultivate those talents, in order to actually make them into that strength. So remember the talent equation, you know, our raw talent times investment, which is the knowledge and skills, equals the strength. And so one of the other things to keep in mind is that, you know, some… and I've mentioned this earlier, but sometimes our strengths, when they are overpowering in our lives, sometimes they can actually manifest themselves in a negative way, or as a weakness. So I mentioned earlier an example of somebody who has a harmony strength. They really enjoy getting people together and getting people… Having people get along. Well, if that person has that harmony strength so strongly where they're unable to manage any conflict because they clam up, then it's really not working for them, right? And so we need to… It's very, very important what StrengthsFinder and the Gallup researchers emphasize, is that we can't only focus on our strengths, right? That's… That would be missing half of the picture. It's important to focus on our strengths and our areas of growth. And what Gallup researchers think is that when we identify that strength, that, you know, achiever, that harmonizer, you know, name any one of your 34 top talents. We can use that in order to work around our areas of weakness. We can't just ignore our weaknesses, but we have to utilize our strengths and what we're good at to be able to live a more happy and productive and satisfying life. So that's what StrengthsFinder… The results give you. And again, there is many, many resources. And in working with a counselor in a career counselor on that, you can find ways to meaningful apply lots of different strategies in your career as well as in your life.
