00:00:00
KRISTI KANEL  Hi. I'm Dr. Kristi Kanel. In this video, I will be discussing the ABC model of crisis intervention which I have been developing and working on up for the past 20 years and which can be found, described in detail in my book, A Guide to Crisis Intervention, in its third edition now. In the following video, I will begin with a brief presentation of the development of crisis intervention, the definition of crisis and the goal of crisis intervention. Following that presentation, there'll be a discussion of the ABC model of crisis intervention. Following that, there will be two sessions with two different clients in which I will demonstrate the ABC model of crisis intervention. After each session, there will be a brief debriefing period with my colleague, Glenda Gilmore, a licensed marriage and family therapist, who has also been teaching this course for over 20 years. 

00:01:15
Introduction 

00:01:15
KRISTI KANEL Crisis Intervention really began after the 1942 Coconut Grove Nightclub fire. Gerald Caplan and Eric Lindemann who, were two psychiatrists in that area, ah, began something called the Wellesley Project in which the survivors of this nightclub fire were treated and the families of them. Uhm, this was probably the biggest trauma up to date in U.S. history where almost 500 people were killed overnight. And at that point in history, there really wasn't any trauma response teams or brief therapy models, pretty much, everybody was trained in long-term psychiatry and, and what they learned to use back then were non-professionals. They gathered up teachers, housewives, clergy, anybody who was interested to help. And they did some brief training and studied the reactions and coping behaviors of these survivors and their families. Based on what they learned, they, they coined the term "Preventive Psychiatry" because they came to believe that if you could get to these people after trauma quickerin, quick enough, you could prevent them from having psychiatric symptoms later on. Later on, the term "Crisis Intervention" began to be used for the same kinds of processes. Caplan and, and Lindemann in this Wellesley Project, after they studied people, came up with characteristics of effective coping people. Based on this, these seven characteristics, he do, created the model that could be utilized in, in terms of the goals of crisis intervention. The first thing he came up with is seeking information and reality. It's very important that when somebody is going to a crisis, they are provided with accurate, realistic, details and information about what they're going through and how to be helped, how to get resources. Another characteristic is freely exploring feelings and tolerating frustration. Ah, it's important to allow people to have their feelings in session with you. That way they can master them. Another thing that they found to be helpful was actively invoking help from others. When in a crisis, it's good not to try to handle it alone, and so crisis intervention attempts to hook people up with, with helpers. Another thing they found that was effective was breaking problems down into manageable bits and working through them one at a time so a person doesn't feel overwhelmed by the trauma that they're experiencing. Along with that is being aware of fatigue and pacing coping efforts while trying to maintain control and function in as many areas as possible. You don't want somebody just giving up and not participating in regular life activities during a crisis period, but you also need to let them know you can slow down. You also want them to master feelings, learn to be flexible and being willing to change is very important in coping with a crisis. Lastly, people who can trust in themself and others and have, ah, optimistic attitude about the outcome tend to do better in a crisis. So, as we do crisis intervention, we always wanna keep these characteristics in mind as we help people through their crisis process. I'd like to give now a working definition of a crisis. Some people think of crisis and they think of panic and people freaking out and being out of control. That's not always the case. Uhm, basically, there are certain parts of a crisis that we, we need to understand because as we do crisis intervention, part of what we're gonna do is identify the components of the person's crisis state. Once we know these components and we identify it, we know we understand what their problem is and we can do some other things to help them through it. 

00:05:15
Definition of a Crisis 

00:05:15
KRISTI KANEL The first thing we wanna understand is the precipitating event. This is something that has actually happened in their life and it's usually occurred in the last month before they come in for some kind of help. It's important to get that precipitating event because that's triggered the crisis state. Now, many people would think that the precipitating event is what causes the crisis. In fact, it's more about how the event is perceived by the particular person, how they interpret it, and it's often interpreted in a threatening or negative way, and that's what leads to feelings that are unpleasant, what we often call subjective distress or emotional disequilibrium. Now, if this was all that a person experience, we might just call this stress because things happen in our life. We experience them as negative and we have unpleasant feelings. But in order for it to really be a crisis, the next two characteristics- 

00:06:20
Definition of Crisis Continued 

00:06:20
KRISTI KANEL - much, must exist, that the subjective distress or emotional impairment leads to impairment in functioning. Somehow their daily living, their work functioning, their academic functioning, or perhaps social functioning is impaired. And lastly, their attempts to cope and manage the situation have failed. That is when we have the true definition of a crisis. So, one of the things we're going to do in the ABC model is identify all aspects of this, of this crisis for the person. The general goal of crisis counseling is to increase functioning and decrease the subjective distress. We take a two-prong approach in doing this. The first thing we wanna do is alter or change the perceptions that create the negative feelings in the first place. It's really difficult to go in and just change somebody's feelings. But if we think back and realize that those feelings were caused by the person's perception and the way they think about the event, it makes sense that if we change the way they think about the event, that'll change the way they feel about the event. The other thing we wanna do is provide coping strategies, and that'll help them cope in general with the crisis state. Some general considerations in doing crisis work, is to realize it can be useful and modified for most situations. It can be used on hotlines in a 10-minute phone call. It could be used in an outpatient counseling center of some type at non-profit agencies where people might stay 45 days for a residential facility. And managed care companies and HMOs often use the short term "crisis model," and it's often used by community trauma response and critical incident debriefing teams. In fact, if you look up critical incident debriefing, you'll see that many of the things they recommend are exactly in this crisis model. Before I begin the presentation of the ABC model, I'd like to give your class an opportunity to discuss some of the questions on the study guide that's provided for you. 

00:08:30
Pause the video to discuss the review questions for Chapter 1 Chapter Two Overview of the ABC Model and Cognitive Tree 

00:08:30
KRISTI KANEL  The ABC Model is a very structured approach that directly focuses on the precipitating event, that which brought the client in now. It's very important to develop a strong personal rapport quickly and gather information quickly yet smoothly. You don't want it to look like an interrogation. In general, the A part refers to developing and maintaining rapport. This is something you wanna do throughout B and C. In the B part, the focus is on identifying the nature of the crisis and altering cognitions. The C part is a way to wrap up the session and provide coping strategies and referrals. But throughout B and C, we wanna continue to do A, which are basic attending skills. One of the ways in which we change cognitions in the B section is to identify cognitions. This seems to be one of the most effective components of this ABC Model. If we can think of a cognitive tree where we start with what the client presents, identify all aspects of the crisis and understand how they think about the crisis, we are like climbing a cognitive tree to understand the real essence of what's causing their distress. So, this is the whole purpose of the B section and we can't do any of our altering of cognitions until we know what the cognitions are in the first place. 

00:10:10
Chapter Three "A" Basic Attending Skills 

00:10:10
KRISTI KANEL  I'd like to now do a brief presentation of the A part, which is Basic Attending Skills. Basic Attending Skills include basic attending behavior such as good eye contact, verbal following, minimal encouragers like nodding of the head, and a very interested posture. Body language says a lot and it could make the person want to talk or close up. Paraphrasing and clarifying are two other basic attending skills, open-ended questions that begin with how and what, reflection of emotions, and summarizations. I'll now cover each one of those individually. Paraphrasing. Paraphrasing is a way of restating in the counselor's own words what the client just said. It shows the client that the counselor understands the basic facts and thoughts. It establishes empathy and a nonjudgmental stance. It can be done in a questioning form when you're clarifying a fact that maybe wasn't quite understood by the counselor. Open-ended questions are best done when related to what the client just said. We should use a word or a phrase the client said when asking an open-ended question so it relates to what the client is thinking about. It allows the client to explore and examine more of what was just said without leading the client into territory that may be irrelevant to the client. And it does not make the client feel defensive like "why" questions often do. And it doesn't lead to dead end as "do you" and "are you" questions often do 'coz those can be answered "yes" or "no" and you don't really get much information from close-ended questions. Another basic attending skill is reflection of emotions. These are best done immediately following a display of nonverbal feelings by a client. They can be done after client expresses a fervent, feeling verbally as well. You wanna keep it simple, the shorter the better, as this allows the client to stay with the feeling. If you add too much facts and thoughts to it, then the reflection of feeling could get lost in facts and thoughts and they lose contact with their emotion at the time. Sometimes you can reflect by just pointing out, "I noticed that you have tears in your eyes as you talk about this." Other times, you could say, "You seem sad when you talk about this." Summarization. This is a statement that ties together most of the facts, thoughts and feelings presented in the interview. Ah, it's very useful when transitioning from B to C. Beginning counselors might wanna summarize. Often they might, they go blank so they don't know what else to do. So, a summarization can help the client talk about what is relevant to them at that moment. At this point, we're going to begin our first session with Desiree. You can look for basic attending skills as you begin this opening segment. After the segment, take time in your class to discuss some of the basic attending skills that you observed going on. 

00:13:30
Chapter Four First Segment of Counseling Session with Desiree, demonstrating "A" 

00:13:30
KRISTI KANEL  Hi, Desiree. Uhm, I'm just interested today to find out what you'd like to talk about so anything you feel that's on your mind or you'd like to go over with me, I'd be happy to hear from you. 

00:13:45
DESIREE MCCUNE  Ah, well, Dr. Kanel, I was on campus, uhm, just a couple of days ago. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
DESIREE MCCUNE And I had a little incident where I had a panic attack. 

00:13:55
KRISTI KANEL Oh. 

00:13:55
DESIREE MCCUNE And I was walking into one of the buildings on campus and I had seen someone that's pretty much had given me, ah, really bad, ah, episodic event where I just, I saw them and they, I don't know. There's something about them just gave me a very eerie feeling and it started to bring up bad feelings and I just had, a, a really bad reaction to seeing them and I ran into the locker room and start hyperventilating, and good thing it was at the end of my day where I was gonna, ah, go to work, but, ah, I end up going back to my car and I couldn't, I couldn't drive. I was still hyperventilating and I started crying and. (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
Paraphrase 

00:14:45
KRISTI KANEL It sounds like that was a really, uhm, a traumatic event for you. This, this happened two days ago? 

00:14:50
DESIREE MCCUNE  Uh hmm, yes. 

00:14:55
KRISTI KANEL Okay. And it's just that you saw somebody and- 

00:15:00
Clarification 

00:15:00
KRISTI KANEL - all of a sudden, you went into this panic mode and ran to your car... (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
KRISTI KANEL ...and you, it sounds like, and then you were stuck there. 

00:15:05
DESIREE MCCUNE I was stuck there for two hours, two and a half hours. (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
DESIREE MCCUNE And I had to call my dad and I was crying and I told him I can't drive. I can't drive. Come and get me. I can't drive and, and he basically, luckily that we didn't live too far away from campus, but, ah, he basically had to sit in the car with me. I, I couldn't move and I was sitting. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
KRISTI KANEL So for two and a half hours- 

00:15:30
Paraphrase 

00:15:30
KRISTI KANEL - you were crying and panicked and paralyzed. 

00:15:35
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
KRISTI KANEL What were some of the- 

00:15:35
Open-ended Question 

00:15:35
KRISTI KANEL - thoughts going through your head at that time? 

00:15:40
DESIREE MCCUNE I just had a lot of images going through my head. I had, uhm, just a lot of memories coming and flooding into me where I could not see straight and I... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

00:15:50
DESIREE MCCUNE ...pretty much was just doubled over my steering wheel and just saying to myself, "It'll go away. It'll go away. It'll go away." It was just a flood of, of images, just different, different images of different periods of time in my life and I just got flooded. 

00:16:05
KRISTI KANEL It sounds like they were so terrifying that- 

00:16:10
Reflection 

00:16:10
KRISTI KANEL - it immobilized you. You somehow couldn't deal with the images. They were so bad. 

00:16:15
DESIREE MCCUNE Yeah. I, I couldn't deal, I was just crying and my dad couldn't do anything or say anything to console me and he was very worried. He'd never seen me have that bad of a reaction and he's seen me in public places have, have reactions, but this was the worst where I, I couldn't drive to another location and, ah, or make it home. 

00:16:40
KRISTI KANEL What do you think- 

00:16:40
Open-ended Question 

00:16:40
KRISTI KANEL - made this one so much worse than other times? 

00:16:45
DESIREE MCCUNE I'm not, (sighs) I think it's, I think it's just what having a, a bad experience with the person in the first place. I think it's, that that person didn't, didn't really make me feel good in the first place, and then, you know, you just, you just have a gut instinct. You just have that they have this, this emanation of just badness, and it doesn't, it doesn't mesh with, with how you are, and you have a reaction and it just brings bad things up that you don't want to have come up, is, that's the only way I can explain. I just didn't, didn't mesh with that person. I didn't, it, it's not as though I have hung out with that person. It's just intermittent meetings because, you know, it's, it's, it's a campus... (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
DESIREE MCCUNE ...and you meet a lot of people, you see a lot of people and it's just intermittent meetings for, for one reason or another and that person, you can't get away from that person. It's just bad, bad, bad feelings, bad energies, bad, just bad feelings. And I just couldn't, I couldn't get away from that person fast enough before everything began to flood out of me. It was just, ah, an enormous flood where I, I literally ran into the locker room. 

00:18:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay, so let me make sure I understand. 

00:18:25
Clarification 

00:18:25
KRISTI KANEL Uhm, you knew this person that you saw that day, a couple of days ago, you've seen, was it a male or female? 

00:18:30
DESIREE MCCUNE It was a female. 

00:18:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay, so you've known this female. 

00:18:35
Summarization 

00:18:35
KRISTI KANEL And you're saying in the past you always felt some, upset or bad every time you would have an interaction with her. And in this particular time, when you saw her, the reaction was so bad, you ran and basically, were in tears, terrified and couldn't function and so you called your dad. 

00:18:50
DESIREE MCCUNE  That is correct. 

00:18:55
KRISTI KANEL  You also said that it brought up a flood of memories. 

00:19:00
DESIREE MCCUNE  That is correct. The memories were just past experiences from my, my earlier, young, younger life. I mean, I was, I was raped con, consecutively numerous times. 

00:19:20
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
DESIREE MCCUNE I was. (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
KRISTI KANEL I'm sorry to hear that. When you were a child, you said? 

00:19:30
DESIREE MCCUNE Ah, the last time I was raped I was 17, 18. 

00:19:35
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

00:19:35
DESIREE MCCUNE And they were also, ah, sexually abusing me from a very young age. 

00:19:45
Pause the video to discuss the review questions for Chapter 4 Chapter Five "B" Identifying the Nature of the Crisis, Ethical Issues, Altering Cognitions 

00:19:45
KRISTI KANEL  Okay. Before we continue our session with Desiree, I'd like to discuss the B Section, which is by far the meat of any therapy session. Uhm, this is where we're identifying the nature of the crisis and offering different ways to think about it. Now, it doesn't necessarily have to be done in the order in which I'm presenting it. Conversations don't usually work that way. So, what a smooth counselor does is listen to their client and as you hear something that relates to some of this material, you, you identify the material as it seems natural to the client. We want to identify the precipitating event: What brought the client in now? There has to be something in the past two weeks, a month that really trigger them to be in a crisis state. And we wanna be very uhm, direct when we ask these questions. The more direct you are, the easier it is for the client. When a client is in crisis, they need directness. So, if you can help them organize their thoughts, this will help the client present to you the material you need to help them. You also want to identify perceptions and thoughts and meanings about the situation. This is not usually done in normal conversations but this is really, really important in crisis intervention. You can't begin to help them think differently if you do not understand what thoughts are making them feel bad in the first place. You also need to identify emotions and any other subjective distress. You want to identify their current functioning level and impairments in functioning. There are also a few other ethical concerns that are important to assess whether you need to do a thorough assessment or not. One of these is suicide. Many people in crisis have suicidal feelings. They feel there's no hope, that life's not worth living and we need to conduct a good thorough suicide assessment if we get any indication that the depression is severe or they might say things like I feel helpless, hopeless, life is not worth living. So a good suicide assessment is very important. Also we need to assess whether he might be a danger to others. Uhm, or, in, additionally, any abuse issues such as child abuse, elder abuse, disabled adult abuse. These are mandated areas in which crisis workers have to report to officials. Uhm, the last ethical issue has to do with medical concerns such as serious mental illness, any type of dementia or neurological issues, also substance dependence. If somebody is addicted to a drug or alcohol, they often need medical referrals to help them work through that physiologically. These are all ethical issues because there are laws or ethical standards ah, about all of these issues. Some were mandated to report, others were permitted to break confidentiality and some require that we, we have physician involvement 'coz you need to know the limits of your qualifications. Also in the B Section is something I call altering cognitions. And there are four therapeutic interaction processes that I have observed over the years that therapist tend to use during therapy. The first one is called support and validation statements. These statements let the client know that what he or she is feeling and experiencing is understandable and difficult. And that they are entitled to feel what they are feeling. This is not to tell them its okay for you to feel this way, I totally understand, it's to say it's understandable. Sure, people going through this, feel like this, just to normalize the experience for them. Educational statements are something else we want to offer. These are comments from the counselor that provide the client with information about the crisis. They are often used when a client presents with myths or false knowledge about their situation. Sometimes just knowing that something is normal reduces subjective distress. Empowerment statements are something else we offer clients. These are statements that show the client that they have choices and areas where they have power. These are particularly useful for clients who feel helpless and who have been victims. Reframes, these comments are extremely effective when done properly. They utilize the client's perspective and frame of reference regarding the crisis. The counselor must slightly change the frame by helping client see the situation just a little bit differently but using the client's original frame. They're usually difficult to explain and teach. They're usually just occur to the counselor intuitively and I'm hoping in our session you'll see a few reframes. At this point, we're gonna continue the session with Desiree, after which there will be a slight pause in the video for you to discuss some of the questions on your study guide. 

00:25:10
Chapter Six Second Segment of Counseling Session with Desiree, demonstrating "B" 

00:25:10
KRISTI KANEL  And you're saying- 

00:25:20
Identify Precipitating Event 

00:25:20
KRISTI KANEL - seeing this woman triggered you to remember these events or these rapes that you experienced? 

00:25:25
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. Yeah, they were my father's co-workers. And I just, I had a flood of energy, ah, just had of, a flood of energy's come to me and, and all these memories and. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
[sil.] 

00:25:50
KRISTI KANEL  When you had those- 

00:25:55
Begin Exploring Cognitions 

00:25:55
KRISTI KANEL - memories, what were some of the thoughts you had? I think I know the feelings, panic, terror, what were some of the thoughts that were going on in your mind when the memories started to come to you? 

00:26:05
DESIREE MCCUNE  Hatred, anger, helplessness. (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
KRISTI KANEL Hatred? What do you mean hatred? 

00:26:15
Climbing Cognitive Tree 

00:26:15
KRISTI KANEL How was that thought evolving in your head during that time? 

00:26:15
DESIREE MCCUNE  Hatred just towards the i, individuals that did me harm because I didn't, I, I just, I'd, I didn't like what they were doing to me. Helplessness because nobody would listen to me because I, I would, I would be screaming saying help me, help me. And anger because of what they had done to me. 

00:26:50
KRISTI KANEL  And anger- 

00:26:55
Validation Statement 

00:26:55
KRISTI KANEL - completely justified? 

00:26:55
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
KRISTI KANEL And hatred because, wha, what exactly about- 

00:27:00
Climbing Cognitive Tree 

00:27:00
KRISTI KANEL - being violated like that creates so much hatred in you? 

00:27:05
DESIREE MCCUNE (sighs) The hatred is because of having an enormous amount of distrust towards people. People are not something or individuals that I can have ah, a normal relationship. It takes me a long time to have a normal relationship where, regardless of it being a friendship or an intimate relationship, it takes me a long time. It's, I don't trust people. I have a very difficult time just outwardly trusting someone and, and taking someone for their, their face value. 

00:27:55
KRISTI KANEL So, what you're saying is that you hate the, the people who raped you because that experience has made it difficult for you now to trust people and, (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
KRISTI KANEL and have fulfilling relationships or open relationships, something like that? 

00:28:10
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
KRISTI KANEL That's what you, why you hate them because you're, so, what about what they did to you? Are you thinking, creates this inability to trust people? 

00:28:20
DESIREE MCCUNE  The inability to trust people is just because I don't want people to hurt me. I'm, I just put up a very thick wall... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
DESIREE MCCUNE ...and make sure that people have an understanding, these are my boundaries and don't cross them. 

00:28:40
KRISTI KANEL  So one of your thoughts about having been violated is that everyone's going to hurt you... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
KRISTI KANEL ...or it's potential that... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
DESIREE MCCUNE It's. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
KRISTI KANEL ...everybody could hurt you? 

00:28:55
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. Correct. 

00:28:55
KRISTI KANEL  Ah, Desiree that, that's not true, though, is it? I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
DESIREE MCCUNE No. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
KRISTI KANEL ...part of you knows that's not true but. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes, that, it's not true but it's not, it's not something that I can, I need to say, "Oh! I'll let you in, you're not gonna hurt me." (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
KRISTI KANEL Right. 

00:29:15
DESIREE MCCUNE You know, it's, it's something that I. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
KRISTI KANEL Ah, almost like you can't control that thought? 

00:29:20
DESIREE MCCUNE Correct, correct. 

00:29:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
DESIREE MCCUNE It's just that. It's an immediate, it's just an immediate feeling, (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
DESIREE MCCUNE an immediate emotion. (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
DESIREE MCCUNE It's, it's something that is ah, continuous. When I, when I meet people, I try to make it as, as open and receptive as possible but, but with boundaries. That I'm the one that's in control... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
DESIREE MCCUNE ...of ho, how far... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

00:29:45
DESIREE MCCUNE ...the introductory, ah, period is going to go or whether or not I want to go any further or create a, a, a friendship or, or a professional relationship with that person. 

00:29:55
KRISTI KANEL You, you just triggered a thought on me 'coz earlier you said one of the things you thought about was being helpless. 

00:30:00
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
KRISTI KANEL And no one would help you and so by, sounds like you almost, like, by not trusting people, you, this is a way you have found to feel in control. 

00:30:10
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
KRISTI KANEL Since you can't, based on what your experience was, you don't think you can trust other people to help you... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
DESIREE MCCUNE  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
KRISTI KANEL ...so now, you'll be in control of things. And yet what are, what are some of the implications in that? How has that affected you since the rapes happened and, you know, particularly this last event, what, what are some of the ramifications or consequences of that kind of way of being? 

00:30:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Uhm, I don't have very many friends. 

00:30:45
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
DESIREE MCCUNE I have a very, a very, uhm, secure number of people that are around me that I know won't do anything to me. Uhm, I just, I keep them, I just kind of keep them separate from, from other people. I don't introduce them to just anybody. Uhm, you have, you know, I, I pretty much have acquaintances, and then I have professional and then I have, ah, intimate relationships and I kinda keep them sep, separated. So, I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
KRISTI KANEL We ca, you know what we call that? Have you heard compartmentalization? (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay, you have heard that term before. (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
DESIREE MCCUNE  Yes. 

00:31:30
KRISTI KANEL And that, it sounds like that's the way you've managed to control things. 

00:31:30
Reframe 

00:31:30
KRISTI KANEL  What do you think about using compartmentalization as a way of- 

00:31:40
Cognitive Exploration 

00:31:40
KRISTI KANEL - just functioning and being in this world? 

00:31:40
DESIREE MCCUNE I don't think people understand it. I think people think, I've, I've actually been told not to think but people have told me that I'm very standoffish... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
DESIREE MCCUNE ...and that I'm, uhm, very rigid and, uhm, di, disruptive. 

00:32:00
KRISTI KANEL So it, it's, it has some negative... 

00:32:05
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
KRISTI KANEL ...implications for you, doesn't it? 

00:32:05
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. 

00:32:05
KRISTI KANEL  And while I can admire and understand you wanna be- 

00:32:10
Validation Statement 

00:32:10
KRISTI KANEL - in control, because you were hor, horrifically traumatized. That should've never happened to you. Okay. Nobody is prepared and nobody should be ever expected to cope easily with rape and like you said, repeated sexual abuses and then not being believed. That's really much beyond anybody's capacity and it leads to posttraumatic stress disorder. Sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
KRISTI KANEL ...we call it rape trauma- 

00:32:35
Begin Education Statement 

00:32:35
KRISTI KANEL - syndrome, uhm, and you, you've probably heard of PTSD? 

00:32:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Correct. 

00:32:40
KRISTI KANEL And so, sometimes what happens is, is until we worked it through, until you worked this through completely, you still manifest some of these symptoms. And I think the other day, when you saw this woman, you had a flashback. Okay, that's all part of post traumatic stress disorder, having flashbacks that triggers the same feelings and it tru, so what that indicates to me and maybe you can see this, is that you haven't completely worked through the rapes that occurred to you over time, earlier on... (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
KRISTI KANEL ...that it's still triggering events now. And although you've tried to take control through compartmentalization and for some periods of time, you feel safe and together, when things like this happen, it maybe- 

00:33:30
Reframe 

00:33:30
KRISTI KANEL - can serve as a reminder. And maybe it's not so bad because it, it kinda presses the point that it, you have some more work to do. 

00:33:35
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
KRISTI KANEL  Okay, and it's not anything about you being weak or like, you can't handle it. 

00:33:40
Validation Statement 

00:33:40
KRISTI KANEL  Nobody should be expected to handle those kinds of horrific traumas. 

00:33:45
DESIREE MCCUNE  Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
KRISTI KANEL And, uhm, so it, it's normal and it make sense- 

00:33:55
Validation Statement 

00:33:55
KRISTI KANEL - that you would have struggled and continued to have struggles especially in relationships 'coz your perception about the event is, I can't trust people now. 

00:34:00
DESIREE MCCUNE  Correct. 

00:34:05
KRISTI KANEL And so that, in a sense, although you feel in control, the fact that it's still affecting you kind of indicates ah, you're not quite in control. 

00:34:15
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
KRISTI KANEL You know, my, my preference would be- 

00:34:15
Reframe 

00:34:15
KRISTI KANEL - to keep you, to move you in to being a survivor of this and not still a victim of it. Okay. But as I see it, the fact that you're still trying so hard to be in control and still having these functioning problems, you're still somewhat victimized by this. 

00:34:30
DESIREE MCCUNE  Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
KRISTI KANEL And to gain power, it means taking a look at some of these thoughts you're having. That because these people hurt you and certain people didn't believe you, maybe you're thinking, "Well, nobody will believe me, ah, almost everybody could potentially hurt me." 

00:34:50
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
KRISTI KANEL And that kinda keeps you trapped in that victim role. 

00:34:50
DESIREE MCCUNE  Uh hmm. I've, I've actually been, uhm, working on, working on myself. 

00:35:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
DESIREE MCCUNE I've been just kinda, (sighs) when I, when I get the opportunity, I just look at, I just look at the memories and I, I, I write them down... 

00:35:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
DESIREE MCCUNE ...in a journal and I, I just say okay, you know, they're, they're, those people are not in my world anymore, but I have to acknowledge what it is that is in the back of my head and I have to, you know. 

00:35:40
KRISTI KANEL When you say what's in the back of your head... 

00:35:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
KRISTI KANEL ...what are you talking about there? 

00:35:40
DESIREE MCCUNE  Well, it's, it's ah, just residual memories, the, the, the flashbacks that I have, I understand it, the residual memories and I have to say to myself that I have to take co, control and I have to, ah, you know, understand and I have to just go into a quiet, a quietness and just acknowledge what it is that has happened. So through my journaling, I'm able to just write down everything and just read over a period of time and say, "Okay, this happened, this happened, this happened." But having an understanding that nobody's going to be able to do it to me again, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm older, I'm stronger. I, I have an understanding and I've also got involved with yoga so that's... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
DESIREE MCCUNE ...ah, allowed me to open up and be more, uhm, pay more attention to myself and give myself what it is that, that I need. Instead... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
DESIREE MCCUNE ...of trying to, you know, as you say, compartmentalize everything and, and try to be more lo, lose. 

00:37:00
KRISTI KANEL Well, I, I'm, I'm impressed of how much you're doing. I mean, that's a lot of work you've been doing, uhm, 'coz you're acknowledging that this is still, a problem for you, can we say that? 

00:37:15
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. 

00:37:15
KRISTI KANEL Okay. And then, that the thing that concern me is that, the other day this, you, just by seeing somebody, it got you into such a state. You, you weren't able to drive and, you know, in terms of safety and things like that, Uhm, is there other ways- 

00:37:25
Identify Impairments in Functioning 

00:37:25
KRISTI KANEL  -in which you are, you know, since that event, have you been functioning, you know, you know, two days ago and so you're coming in soon. That's really good. So, have you managed since that event? 

00:37:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Uhm, I've just been talking more with my parents. My parents and I have been more open and receptive to, ah, the way I, the way I am, uhm. 

00:37:50
KRISTI KANEL  How's school? How are you doing in school? Uhm. 

00:37:55
DESIREE MCCUNE School's, school's okay, school's good. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

00:37:55
DESIREE MCCUNE I have a good GPA, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. 

00:38:00
DESIREE MCCUNE considering I've, I've been working long, hard hours. Ah, so my GPA is very good and, uhm, I'm, I'm happy, I'm happy with the way school is. But I'm, I noticed that I've been using school as, as a crutch. It's, (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
DESIREE MCCUNE it's kind of been just pay attention to school, pay attention to school and then everything else will kinda line up and then you can deal with what it is that you need to do with later. But right now, school is more important, school is more important, emotions are not so important. 

00:38:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
KRISTI KANEL  And what do you think about that last statement you just made, emotions aren't that important? 

00:38:45
DESIREE MCCUNE I have to pay, I have to pay attention to, I have to pay attention to what's in front of me because my past has held me back for so long. That I want new and improved in better things, but I understand that I have to work through my past. But I can only do so much at, at one time. 

00:39:10
KRISTI KANEL Absolutely. 

00:39:10
DESIREE MCCUNE  I can't, I can't say I can do all these at the same time and I'll be okay. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
KRISTI KANEL I'm glad to hear that you're tolerating that, you know- 

00:39:20
Caplan's Characteristic # 2 

00:39:20
KRISTI KANEL - that you're not wanting to fix it all at once. Okay, I, I'm, ah, that, that's important that you let yourself kinda work- 

00:39:30
Caplan's Characteristic # 4 

00:39:30
KRISTI KANEL - through it, slowly, step by step and acknowledge it. Uhm, and I hope that you can kind of see that, you know, you have a process of working towards becoming a survivor of this because you did survive it. Okay, like you said, you're, it's not happening again, it's not going to happen again probably. And you, you made it through and I, I wonder if you can turn that into a positive for yourself. 

00:39:55
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
KRISTI KANEL That what does not kill you, makes you stronger. And it... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
KRISTI KANEL ...by the fact that you've survived it- 

00:40:05
Empowerment Statement 

00:40:05
KRISTI KANEL - and you're looking at it can be a, a strengthening thing for you. 

00:40:05
DESIREE MCCUNE  I'm looking at it as a strengthening effort because of everything that I'm, I'm doing, I mean, my studies help me go into an area that I never went before so. 

00:40:20
KRISTI KANEL Ah, what do you mean exactly? 

00:40:20
DESIREE MCCUNE Uhm, well, my studies are, you know, within the psychological venue... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
DESIREE MCCUNE  and so, I'm picking up books that are saying, well, ah, how to heal, how to heal and how to be more, ah, full of courage and, and look at yourself from the inside out. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:40:40
DESIREE MCCUNE And I've been reading books on how to document my feelings, and document my emotions, and just putting it on paper, and putting it where I can read it, and putting it someplace that's in, in front of me instead of in back of me. So, as long as... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
DESIREE MCCUNE ...everything is in front of me I feel that, you know, yes, I'm, I'm gonna say it's an important role of it, ah, of, of control but, maybe it wouldn't be so rigid of a control, maybe it will be an aspect of control where I can look at it and see it instead of running away from it. I think that's really what it is that I'm working on. Instead of running away, because running into a locked room is running away and not facing it, that, if it's in front of me and I can see and I can read it, then, I can understand it and it won't be so fearful. 

00:41:35
KRISTI KANEL That's brave of you. It really is to face it. That's, I agree with you. I think that's what's gonna make this turn for you. To, to see yourself as the survivor. That's how, you don't let those guys that attacked you,- 

00:41:50
Empowerment Statement 

00:41:50
KRISTI KANEL - you don't let them continue to violate you. You know, you said you had hatred 'coz your thoughts were, because of them, I can't trust people. 

00:41:55
DESIREE MCCUNE  Right. 

00:42:00
KRISTI KANEL So, you, you know, one way you can let go of that or at least not give them the power over you anymore, is to continue to, to face it so that you could trust, 'coz my imagination tells me you'd probably wanna trust people. 

00:42:10
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
KRISTI KANEL And not have those, you said that there are some social issues and some interpersonal problems because of this. 

00:42:15
DESIREE MCCUNE  Right. 

00:42:20
KRISTI KANEL And so, to continue the bravery in facing it is important. 

00:42:25
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. I feel that's the only way that I'm going to be able to go forward and I don't wanna go backwards because my schooling has been really good. I've got a good GPA, and I wanna continue, and I wanna go to grad school. That's, that's the only, that's pretty much what I'm looking at as far as my healing is concerned. And as, if I continue on this path, then I know I will be a stronger person. 

00:42:50
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. Surviving something like this can only make you stronger. It can actually make you more stronger and develop stronger coping skills, then, maybe people who would never gone through- 

00:43:05
Reframe 

00:43:05
KRISTI KANEL - traumas like these. You know, I always think about the people who maybe, who survived the, the Nazi concentration camps, or who've lived in war-torn countries. How much strength they must have inside of them to have endured that? I mean, and this is just something that, unfortunately, that happened to you. That it can actually be a strength producing situation for you. 

00:43:25
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. That's my goal. 

00:43:25
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
Pause the video to discuss the review questions for Chapter 6 Chapter Seven "C" Coping Strategies 

00:43:30
KRISTI KANEL  Before we conclude the session with Desiree, I'd like to cover a little bit about the, the C part of the model, the coping part. The most important thing to remember about moving into this section is to have the clients think about what they would like to do to begin to resolve their situation. And you wanna do this before the counselor starts to offer their own ideas. By having the clients ponder their own ideas and then using these ideas as a starting point for the counselors to brainstorm. Then, you can offer referrals and other coping strategies that the client is not likely to resist because it, it came from them in the first place. So, you wanna ask the client to think of any ideas that he or she has about what they would like to do. Then, ask the client to think of other ideas, maybe things that have worked in the past or things they would tell a friend to do. And you want to encourage a client to do these things and start offering alternative ideas. Some of the things you might offer them to do would be a referral to a support group. These are groups usually run by a professional therapist or, or a paraprofessional, but it is run by a counselor, usually for people who have gone through the same situation. You might refer them to a 12 step group. These are done by non-professionals, usually not run by a counselor, things like Alcoholics Anonymous, or Gamblers Anonymous. These are, usually follow the 12 step tradition and pretty well known. They're wonderful, uhm, interventions because you can go three times a day, seven days a week, and they're free, so, they're ideal for many people. You might refer a client for a medication evaluation if they seem to be suffering from a major mental illness or their symptoms are so severe that they cannot function. Sometimes, it's a temporary medication regime that they'll be put on. A physical examination might be recommended, uhm, so, that's an option and you might offer a physician referral. Legal assistance is sometimes necessary, as are referrals to various agencies, shelters, or other clinicians. Sometimes, you, the crisis worker will just continue to work with a particular client and that, but you might offer them homework assignments. Maybe you'll have them journal and write about something specific. You might do assertion training or recommend them to go through an assertion training class. Reading books related to the crisis is often is often helpful as is watching films. Uhm, stress management classes are often very helpful as well as are college classes. One thing you wanna do before you end the session is get commitment from that client that they're going to do something. You wanna have a definite plan of action and a commitment that they will follow through. We'll now finish the session with Desiree, and afterwards, there'll be a slight pause in the video for you to discuss the chapter questions. 

00:46:35
Chapter Eight Final Segment of Counseling Session with Desiree, demonstrating "C" 

00:46:35
KRISTI KANEL  What do you think, uhm, specifically, now that this event happened a couple of days ago? 

00:46:45
Start Having Client Brainstorm Coping Strategies 

00:46:45
KRISTI KANEL What do you think would be some things that you can do more specifically, to, to ensure, maybe that doesn't happen again? 

00:46:55
DESIREE MCCUNE Well, I avoided the location awhile but. (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
KRISTI KANEL What do you think about that? 

00:47:05
DESIREE MCCUNE I don't think that's, I don't think that ah, really is doing me any good by avoiding the situation. I think it's, (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
KRISTI KANEL Well, what's, what's not good about that? (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
DESIREE MCCUNE ...it's creating more, it's creating more, uhm, ah, tension inside of me where, you know, if, if I avoid it, then, I'm not facing it, and it's animosity within myself because I'm not saying, "Okay, the situation happened but you can't, you, you, you can't avoid the situation. You have to face it. You have to acknowledge it." And so, therefore, I haven't acknowledged it. I've kind of hidden it away from me and not acknowledged it. So, that's not really a good. 

00:47:55
KRISTI KANEL  Are you saying you don't wanna keep avoiding that location? 

00:48:00
DESIREE MCCUNE No. 

00:48:00
KRISTI KANEL Then, what do you think you could do to get yourself to that location? 

00:48:05
DESIREE MCCUNE By just going and just, just being there, just making my presence known and, and, and, and being more assertive in saying, "Okay. I own the situation." 

00:48:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
DESIREE MCCUNE  "I own this location. Everything here belongs to me just as much as it belongs to somebody else." 

00:48:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
DESIREE MCCUNE You know, I'm a student here. I have the right to be here. 

00:48:25
KRISTI KANEL  And how could you inoculate yourself or prepare yourself like, what if you ran into that woman again, what are some things you think you could do? 

00:48:35
DESIREE MCCUNE Uhm, I would hope not to run away. I would hope to just stay on my ground and just, if I do have em, emotions come flooding into my head again, that I would just stand there and, and allow them to be there, and just take it and hope, you know, and allow my, my inner strength to just take the bearing, just be able to take the burden and just let it be. 

00:49:05
KRISTI KANEL What would be some things you could, maybe, say to yourself if you were to run into this woman? That could help manage and master those feelings. 

00:49:15
DESIREE MCCUNE  She's not them. She's not them. That's basically about. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
KRISTI KANEL How about adding, "And she's not going to hurt me." 

00:49:25
DESIREE MCCUNE And I won't allow her to hurt me. (laughs) 

00:49:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Is that works... (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
DESIREE MCCUNE I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
KRISTI KANEL ...better for you? 

00:49:30
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. I mean, that would be something that would be mentally and, and verbally said to myself. 

00:49:35
KRISTI KANEL That's something you can remember to do? 

00:49:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Yeah. Definitely. 

00:49:40
KRISTI KANEL  Anything else you can think of that you could do to master your feelings and, you know, work on issues, that trust issues that you have with people in general? 

00:49:55
DESIREE MCCUNE (sighs) If I, I try to spend as much time with people as possible by giving them an opportunity and a chance... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
DESIREE MCCUNE ...but, if I feel discomfort I, I try to work through it but if it's just a discomfort that I just can't bear. 

00:50:10
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
DESIREE MCCUNE Then I ha, I walk away, because it's just, it makes, it does not make me feel good. 

00:50:15
KRISTI KANEL When you feel the discomfort, what's that discomfort like? 

00:50:20
DESIREE MCCUNE It's nausea. 

00:50:20
KRISTI KANEL Nausea? Okay. And so, what's something that you could do maybe to overcome that feeling? 

00:50:25
DESIREE MCCUNE  (sighs) I really don't know. 

00:50:30
KRISTI KANEL Have you, you said you take Yoga- 

00:50:35
Using Client's Previous Ideas 

00:50:35
KRISTI KANEL - and... (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
KRISTI KANEL ...they talk about, take deep cleansing breaths. 

00:50:35
DESIREE MCCUNE  Well, it's sort of like a, a meditation. 

00:50:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:50:40
DESIREE MCCUNE But I. 

00:50:40
KRISTI KANEL  There's training in breathing though. Isn't that true? (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. Yeah. They, they have different styles of breathing where you just calm yourself down, but I would definitely have to walk away. 

00:50:50
KRISTI KANEL Could you walk away temporarily- 

00:50:55
Offer Coping 

00:50:55
KRISTI KANEL - take some cleansing breaths, and then go back, like excuse yourself, (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
DESIREE MCCUNE  That, (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
KRISTI KANEL ...take some deep breaths, and maybe get back. 

00:51:00
DESIREE MCCUNE that would be a possibility. I have not yet, ah, done that. 

00:51:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
DESIREE MCCUNE Uhm, ah. 

00:51:05
KRISTI KANEL Would you be willing to try that? 

00:51:10
DESIREE MCCUNE I would definitely be willing to try that. Ah, if the situation. (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
KRISTI KANEL Same thing if you ran into that woman. 

00:51:15
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
KRISTI KANEL Might as well, use your Yoga for other situations. It can be beneficial. (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:51:20
KRISTI KANEL It actually, taking in breaths like that and solely breathing out actually reduces- 

00:51:25
Education 

00:51:25
KRISTI KANEL - your, your pulse. It reduces your blood pressure. It, it does increase relaxation response in general. 

00:51:30
DESIREE MCCUNE Right. 

00:51:30
KRISTI KANEL And because a lot of what you're experiencing as PTSD symptoms... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
KRISTI KANEL ...of an anxiety, it's almost an ideal way for you to contain the physiological like symptoms that happened to you. 

00:51:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Right. And. (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
KRISTI KANEL So, that's something I hope you really will practice doing on a regular basis when you're around people and you begin to feel a little anxiety. Catch it when it just starts. It's probably... (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. 

00:51:50
KRISTI KANEL ...the best way though. 

00:51:55
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. 

00:51:55
KRISTI KANEL So, maybe something you could do would be pay attention to the beginning symptoms. A little bit of nausea, when you get that ah, oh, feeling or that was little sense, maybe that's when you could do the deep breathing and contain yourself physiologically, and then, maybe that can help you, and then, you could do some of your cognitive messages to yourself. 

00:52:15
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
KRISTI KANEL Would you like to try that, do you think you'll try those things? 

00:52:15
DESIREE MCCUNE Yeah. I, definitely, I mean- 

00:52:20
Get Commitment 

00:52:20
DESIREE MCCUNE - I, I can say that I would definitely try that, but it's also dependent on the moment. It's not like I can just say, "Oh. Oh. Oh, breathe," because someone has, (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
KRISTI KANEL Well, that's what I'm asking you to try to do... (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
DESIREE MCCUNE yeah. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
KRISTI KANEL ...is to recognize and identify... 

00:52:30
DESIREE MCCUNE  Right. 

00:52:35
KRISTI KANEL ...the potential beginnings of a panic attack or the potential beginnings of needing to run away or get away from people. 

00:52:40
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
KRISTI KANEL And force yourself to be reexposed 'coz there's a creation, a little bit of a phobia, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
DESIREE MCCUNE Right. 

00:52:45
KRISTI KANEL ...and that's kinda conditioned because of the original traumas, so, is this something like, you can, maybe begin to do identify, pay attention to yourself, so, that in, in the end, what I could see happening is, you could strengthen and enhance your relationships with people. 

00:53:00
DESIREE MCCUNE  I do wanna enhance my... (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
DESIREE MCCUNE ...relationship. I do want, ah, more friendships, and I do want more intimate relationships, but that's something that, ah, is gonna be slow. 

00:53:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
DESIREE MCCUNE It's not, it's not going to... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
KRISTI KANEL Sure. 

00:53:20
DESIREE MCCUNE ...just happen. 

00:53:20
KRISTI KANEL  But this is just one extra thing to offer you. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
DESIREE MCCUNE Right. 

00:53:25
KRISTI KANEL That maybe you could try. Okay? 

00:53:25
DESIREE MCCUNE Okay. 

00:53:25
KRISTI KANEL  Okay. Thanks Desiree. 

00:53:30
DESIREE MCCUNE You're welcome. 

00:53:30
Pause the video to discuss the review questions for Chapter 8 Chapter Nine Debriefing of Desiree's Session 

00:53:30
KRISTI KANEL  Okay, now that we've completed the session, I've brought my colleague, Glennda Gilmour, who's actually been teaching crisis intervention courses for the last 20 years and she is going to give some of her comments about the sessions which she has been observing. I wanted to kinda structure it in terms of the ABC components. Glennda, did you observe anything in particular during the A part, which we know, actually, A covers B and C, so, can you make some comments and observations about the use of basic attending skills? 

00:54:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR Well, besides looking at your client and nodding and letting her know through non-verbal, you are paying attention. You also paraphrased and reflected constantly throughout the model, clarifying what was going on and just opening your client up to talk more and more. 

00:54:30
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. And so, that's the effect. Can you think of a reason to keep these basic attending skills running throughout? 

00:54:35
GLENNDA GILMOUR  Well, it makes it, ah, more personable, makes it easier for the client to not feel they're being drilled but that you wanna know what they're saying. You wanna be with them. 

00:54:50
KRISTI KANEL Now, as a client, Desiree, were you aware of what she's talking about, the use of paraphrasing, and reflection, and not just a bunch of questions at you? Did you sense that as the client? 

00:55:00
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes, I did. 

00:55:00
KRISTI KANEL And what effect do you think that has on you as a client? 

00:55:05
DESIREE MCCUNE I think it's very soothing. I think that when you are paraphrasing what somebody says, you have an understanding and you're more personable with, with the individual that you're speaking with. 

00:55:15
KRISTI KANEL So you felt I understood. 

00:55:20
DESIREE MCCUNE Correct. 

00:55:20
KRISTI KANEL What you were saying? 

00:55:20
DESIREE MCCUNE Uh hmm. 

00:55:20
KRISTI KANEL Now, Glennda, when we moved into the B, what, what did you notice going on in the B section in terms of cognitive exploration and the kinds of therapeutic interaction, comments? 

00:55:30
GLENNDA GILMOUR Well, you were constantly like, one statement you said is, "What do you mean by hatred?" You were clarifying... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...exactly what meant for her. 

00:55:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:55:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR What her meaning was behind the thought. Uhm, because we can't just assume we know what the client says. Ah, you were, ah, cla, ah, clarifying the feelings. You were talking about how not being able to drive affected her currently since this happened, exploring her whole world... (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...afterwards, and how it affects her relationships or driving her physical body. 

00:56:05
KRISTI KANEL  So trying to tie in the, like the precipitating event. 

00:56:10
GLENNDA GILMOUR Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
KRISTI KANEL And how that, ah, how that is affecting her functioning. 

00:56:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR Right. Right. 

00:56:15
KRISTI KANEL And why do you think that might be important? 

00:56:20
GLENNDA GILMOUR Well, I don't think clients normally think of how this is affecting them and their whole life and by clarifying that, in a sense, it gives some control. It shows what is working, what isn't working, and what they can do. 

00:56:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. And did you notice any of the usage of educational statements, validation, empowerment, reframe. 

00:56:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR Lots. (laughs). 

00:56:40
KRISTI KANEL (laughs) Okay. 

00:56:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR  Ah, educational about what PTSD is, for example, on, ah, what specifically are flash backs and... (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
KRISTI KANEL What if? (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...and how that's affecting her. (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
KRISTI KANEL I was wondering what effect that had on you Desiree to be educated about PTSD. 

00:56:55
DESIREE MCCUNE I think that when educating, be, being educated on what it is that a person is experiencing I, I think that, that also gives a manifestation of control where the, or the client, being me, would have the opportunity to have an understanding of what it is that the emotional experiences are. 

00:57:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Anything else you noticed there, Glennda? (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
GLENNDA GILMOUR You taught her, carp, how she puts things into, to, ah, compartments. 

00:57:25
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. 

00:57:30
GLENNDA GILMOUR And I noticed later on, she was using the words. And she had, it, literally, taking what you had taught her within and now was applying it. 

00:57:35
KRISTI KANEL Okay. And how do you think that could be effective or helpful? 

00:57:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR Sometimes, it helps to, actually, know the words and, of what you're doing. It gives you control, and... (crosstalk) 

00:57:45
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

00:57:45
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...you now know to work with it. 

00:57:50
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Anything else you noticed about empowerment statements, uhm, validation comments, and... (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
GLENNDA GILMOUR Or, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
KRISTI KANEL ...one particular struck out to? 

00:57:55
GLENNDA GILMOUR support statements, how difficult this must be for her, the fact that she's talking with you. 

00:58:00
KRISTI KANEL So, Desiree, how did you feel with me pointing out to you that it was difficult, it must be terrifying, ah, me, pretty much validating how difficult that is? 

00:58:10
DESIREE MCCUNE  Uhm, when, when you're asking me, ah, the question, or not really asking me a que, well, you're asking me a question of how difficult it is for me. I feel that you are, mo, more compassionate with, how you are interested in trying to get more, ah, emotions and more feelings out of me. I feel that it's an opener where I will just give you and release what it is that I'm experiencing. 

00:58:40
KRISTI KANEL I, I found that many time, beginning counselors are afraid to mention to a client how difficult it must be or terrifying. They might be afraid that it would make you feel bad. But it sounds like that's not the case with you, that it actually makes you feel more open and understood. 

00:58:55
DESIREE MCCUNE It's, ah, it's an open release for me. (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
DESIREE MCCUNE It's something that you are opening the door to my understanding and my experiences. (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
DESIREE MCCUNE You, you truly want to hear what it is that I have to say. 

00:59:10
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Now, you noticed some empowerment statements or any other forms of reframes? 

00:59:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR Ah, one reframe was, ah, that flashbacks can show you where you need to work and so... (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...that being terrifying at things, they could be something good. 

00:59:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. What did you, what do you think about that, that the idea, instead of flashbacks being a negative, there, ah, can be a positive 'coz they're communicating to you? Something's not right inside and I need to work on this. What about hear, how, how does hearing that, how did that make you feel? 

00:59:40
DESIREE MCCUNE  Ah, the flash, the, the, the incidents with the flashbacks is, is definitely communicating where my weaknesses lie within myself. 

00:59:50
KRISTI KANEL So, you, you'd, (crosstalk) 

00:59:50
DESIREE MCCUNE  I'd. (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
KRISTI KANEL ...you didn't mind hearing it that way? 

00:59:55
DESIREE MCCUNE No. 

00:59:55
KRISTI KANEL That could be a helpful thing for you. And were there any empowerment statements that you noticed? 

01:00:00
GLENNDA GILMOUR Yeah. Uhm, you showed how she, uhm, could take control of what she's going through, uhm, by seeing someone, uhm, she survived this, that she is, it's her body back. Okay? 

01:00:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
GLENNDA GILMOUR Uhm. 

01:00:25
KRISTI KANEL Did you feel empowered at all during this session? 

01:00:30
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes, I did. I did feel... (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
KRISTI KANEL What do you... (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
DESIREE MCCUNE ...empowered. 

01:00:30
KRISTI KANEL ...think made you feel empowered? 

01:00:35
DESIREE MCCUNE I feel, ah, the empowerment just stemming from the understanding where taking the flashback incident and having control over that and just, and letting it occur, letting it happen. Looking at the, the, the visions and just acknowledging that they're there, and taking the time instead of running away. 

01:01:00
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Now last thing I wanted to comment a little bit about was the movement into the, the termination or the C part, the coping strategies. Glenda, did you notice how that was done in particular where you saw that moving towards were gonna finish this session? 

01:01:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR  You talked about what she's doing right now, like, how she's thinking, how, uhm, that is in the sense, ah, ah, a control of the situation. Ah, she mentioned she's journaling, uhm, breathing, yoga, and then you continually explored that whether on how, what she's doing actually can be a strength for her, how she can use it to cope to survive. You didn't just stick on that but you explored that amongst other areas. 

01:01:50
KRISTI KANEL Yeah, often, in order to come up with a good coping strategy, I listen to what they've talked about earlier on. 

01:01:55
GLENNDA GILMOUR Uh hmm. 

01:01:55
KRISTI KANEL And then I try to make sure that I get from them. That might be useful for them and so, makes more sense to them... (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
GLENNDA GILMOUR Right. 

01:02:05
KRISTI KANEL ...rather than me just throwing that on there to her. 

01:02:05
GLENNDA GILMOUR You took what she offered and you expanded it further. Yoga is more, it's also learning how to breathe... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
KRISTI KANEL Right. 

01:02:10
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...and(ph), plus how you think and you... (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
KRISTI KANEL And I really meant... (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...told her. 

01:02:15
KRISTI KANEL ...what I said about the physiological aspects of PTSD and how the bre, breathing, can really reduce a lot of that, and it can be a great benefit. Do you think that you will follow through with that? 

01:02:30
DESIREE MCCUNE Yes. 

01:02:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. So, it was realistic to offer that as a coping strategy. 

01:02:30
DESIREE MCCUNE  Yes. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
GLENNDA GILMOUR It's realistic coz she was already doing that. 

01:02:35
KRISTI KANEL Yes, yes. It had to come from her first. 

01:02:35
GLENNDA GILMOUR  Uh hmm. 

01:02:40
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Is there anything more and either of you ladies would like to say or is this about it? 

01:02:45
GLENNDA GILMOUR Well, you talked about whether how can she prepare herself? What if this happened again? 

01:02:50
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Uh hmm. 

01:02:50
GLENNDA GILMOUR And basically if this precipitating event hap, happens again, she now has an idea on how to deal with it. 

01:02:55
KRISTI KANEL  That's one of our goals for crisis work, is to, you know, is to learn a coping strategy should a further precipitating event or trauma occur. 

01:03:05
GLENNDA GILMOUR Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:03:05
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Anything else or that it for now? 

01:03:10
GLENNDA GILMOUR Ah, probably for now. 

01:03:10
KRISTI KANEL Okay, thanks. 

01:03:10
DESIREE MCCUNE  Thank you. 

01:03:15
Chapter Ten Counseling Session with Joseph (returning Iraq combat veteran with PTSD) with subscripts reflecting the ABC Model 

01:03:15
KRISTI KANEL  I'm now going to conduct another session with a different client, Joseph. He's an Iraq war veteran and this time, we're not going to interrupt the session for review questions. So there'll be no pauses but I do want you to watch and assess and see if you can find the ABC model in usage with Joseph. 

01:03:45
KRISTI KANEL  Okay, hi Joseph. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
JOSEPH CHANG Hi. (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
KRISTI KANEL today, I thought we would just spend a little bit of time and, I know there's something that's been troubling you so please feel free to tell me a little bit about what's been going on. 

01:03:55
JOSEPH CHANG  Yes. Uhm, I am involved with, ah, Student Veterans Association... (crosstalk) 

01:04:00
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:04:00
JOSEPH CHANG ...on campus. 

01:04:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
JOSEPH CHANG And we're preparing this, ah, a veteran appreciation event. And I got to interview with, ah, with this journalist. And, his question, ah, about my, ah, experience at, ah, during deployment, ah, kinda made me think about. 

01:04:20
KRISTI KANEL Deployment where? 

01:04:20
JOSEPH CHANG Deployment to Iraq. 

01:04:25
KRISTI KANEL Oh, okay. 

01:04:25
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, made me think again. Ah, it's been already two, two years and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:04:30
JOSEPH CHANG Gave me kinda flashback... (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:04:30
JOSEPH CHANG ...of the, ah, some of the incidence. And, the journalist, ah, asked me, ah, the names of the soldiers that got, ah, killed, KIA during the, ah, during the, the operations. And, I was trying to give him a correct name but that also kinda triggered me to think about the details of the, the deployment which, ah, gave me some of the PTSD symptoms. 

01:05:00
KRISTI KANEL When you say PTSD symptoms, what are you referring to? 

01:05:05
JOSEPH CHANG Uhm, it's been two years after, after coming back home from the deployment to Iraq. Ah, within about six to, six months to about eight months, I was going through some, ah, sensitive anger issues and, ah, nightmares. 

01:05:25
KRISTI KANEL When you say- 

01:05:25
Cognitive Exploration 

01:05:25
KRISTI KANEL - sensitive anger issues, what do you mean exactly? 

01:05:30
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, I'll say two, it's, it's two different issues, I guess. (crosstalk) 

01:05:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:05:30
JOSEPH CHANG As, ah, ah, I would be, I'd be very sensitive to the noises and, uh tsk, surroundings and also the conversations. Ah, I was very sensitive to the, to the topics of war, government, (crosstalk) 

01:05:45
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:05:45
JOSEPH CHANG  and so forth. And, it triggers me to be angry, ah, resen, resentful and, ah, sad. 

01:05:55
KRISTI KANEL Did this just stay feelings inside or did you act out the angry feelings or sad feelings at all? 

01:06:00
JOSEPH CHANG  No, I didn't get to act out. I'm, ah, my personality is usually pretty calm and, ah, I'm very, ah, emphatic. Ah, I try to, ah, understand where other people are coming from. 

01:06:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
JOSEPH CHANG So, I don't act out like that. But, ah, usually go inward. 

01:06:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
JOSEPH CHANG  So I've been kinda repressing that feeling. 

01:06:25
KRISTI KANEL Mostly the anger? 

01:06:25
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
KRISTI KANEL  What about the sadness that you mentioned? 

01:06:30
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, yes, I've been kinda repressing it inwardly because people don't' understand, ah, that probably is my judgment but at the same time it's usually true. People who are not there have hard time understanding what I'm going through. So I figured that it's not worth talking about it. And it usually brings people down, so, I'd rather not talk about it. Uhm. 

01:07:00
KRISTI KANEL It sounds like you're trying to protect other people by not talking about it, is that what you're saying? 

01:07:05
JOSEPH CHANG Protecting, I would say, not wasting their time. 

01:07:10
KRISTI KANEL Oh, okay. 

01:07:10
JOSEPH CHANG Right, because they wouldn't understand. 

01:07:15
KRISTI KANEL So, this, this- 

01:07:15
Identify Precipitating Event 

01:07:15
KRISTI KANEL - conversation with this journalist kinda triggered a resurgence of these, of remembering specific events that happened in Iraq when you were... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
JOSEPH CHANG Yes. 

01:07:25
KRISTI KANEL ...deployed there. And then you've been, since that conversation with him, what, what have you been doing, ah, how have you been dealing with that or what's happened with you? 

01:07:35
JOSEPH CHANG  First of all, his question about, uhm, was there any other, ah, soldiers who got killed around me or the soldiers that I knew, got killed. Ah, that made me think of, of going back to the time where, yes, I, uhm, have soldiers who got killed around me and, ah, uhm, I think that was fine with me because I took that as, uhm, it's a natural thing, you know, it's a combat, it's a war, so, people die. So, when I was there, I was, more calm and more stable with that. However, when the journalist asked me about that, after two years, ah, it really, ah, gave me a strong flashback of his face. 

01:08:30
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:08:30
JOSEPH CHANG His, ah, the conversations we had before he died and, yeah, that's, ah, it was various, it was a strong emotion that I felt. And I felt sorry for their family again. 

01:08:45
KRISTI KANEL That sounds like sadness. 

01:08:45
JOSEPH CHANG  Oh yes, and, uhm. 

01:08:50
KRISTI KANEL When you say strong emotion, I'm... (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:08:50
KRISTI KANEL ...thinking you're talking about sadness? 

01:08:55
JOSEPH CHANG It is a sadness, uhm, and enough of this will be, ah, anger again toward the, ah, toward the situation, toward the policy, toward the, the decisions(ph) that, that soldiers are there and dying, yeah, some. (crosstalk) 

01:09:15
KRISTI KANEL So, the, some of the thoughts you have about it is that they, you, you don't like- 

01:09:20
Clarification 

01:09:20
KRISTI KANEL - the decision for soldiers to be there and die. Is that what you're saying, that, that's what gets you angry? 

01:09:25
JOSEPH CHANG Right. The fact that, uhm, you know, this beco, this war becomes more unpopular. Ah, I don't wanna to get, ah, politic, political here but, ah, yeah. War soldiers are doing their best, yet, the situation is not, many times not getting better and, ah, many soldiers are dying, so- 

01:09:50
Reflection 

01:09:50
JOSEPH CHANG and, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:09:50
KRISTI KANEL And that gets you angry? 

01:09:50
JOSEPH CHANG It gets me angry, sad, mixed emotions. 

01:09:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:09:55
JOSEPH CHANG Right. So, uhm, yeah, I went through severe sadness, anger, and resentment for about six to eight month, until I got back to school. I decided to start a, ah, a veteran support group because it's, uh, it's also re, requirement for my major to, to an internship. 

01:10:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:10:20
JOSEPH CHANG  So I was doing internship at the, ah, the Women's Center and Adult Re-entry Center, ah, to help students. And, I decided to start this, ah, support group. 

01:10:35
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:10:35
JOSEPH CHANG And that has been a really, that has been, ah, ah, great healing, ah, process for me, ah, trying to support the, ah, soldiers and veterans who've been through the similar situations, and, taking care of their needs. Ah. 

01:10:50
KRISTI KANEL Sounds like it's taking care of your needs as well. 

01:10:50
JOSEPH CHANG  Exactly. (crosstalk) 

01:10:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
JOSEPH CHANG I didn't notice it until recently that I had no more strong extreme, ah, sadness, anger and resentment because I'm doing, I'm spending all this positive energy toward other fellow veterans. 

01:11:05
KRISTI KANEL So then, and yet, when this journalist brought up the, this soldier that you knew... (crosstalk) 

01:11:10
JOSEPH CHANG  Right. 

01:11:15
KRISTI KANEL ...that was killed, you, it did trigger. 

01:11:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:11:15
KRISTI KANEL Remembrances of that and, (crosstalk) 

01:11:20
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:11:20
KRISTI KANEL and, one of the things I'm, was struck about, you said, when you were there in combat and you saw people killed, you seemed to not have a reaction to it. And, yet, now, when you hear about it or think about it, now you're having the reaction to it? 

01:11:35
JOSEPH CHANG Surely, I did, luckily, I didn't get to see that, ah, ah, through my own eyes. Uhm, that was my prayer when I was in Iraq, ah, I prayed everyday that I don't get to see anything, I don't get to shoot anybody, and I don't wanna get shot. Uhm, I was luckily, ah, out of the place when something happened, and something, would already cleared up before I get somewhere. So, I was pretty lucky but I got to hear and see the, the aftermath, math of the, ah, vehicle explosion and so forth, and. (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
KRISTI KANEL And that was traumatic. 

01:12:10
JOSEPH CHANG That is very traumatic? (crosstalk) 

01:12:15
KRISTI KANEL Seeing the aftermath. 

01:12:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. (crosstalk) 

01:12:15
KRISTI KANEL What, what were your thoughts when, when you did see- 

01:12:15
Cognitive Exploration 

01:12:15
KRISTI KANEL  -the vehicles after the explosions? 

01:12:20
JOSEPH CHANG  You know, the thing about that is, soldiers who are deployed and, ah, they're constantly operating, ah, in this kinda, ah, pressured and alert situations, they do not feel much, it's a constant numbness. 

01:12:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:12:40
JOSEPH CHANG If you start focusing on your emotion, you cannot do this. This is a very difficult job. It's, ah, such a tremendously, uhm, pressuring and, ah, you have to get over your emotion, you have to get up and go. So, when I was there as a combat support and, and a male operator, ah, and also a supply sergeant, I had to repress those thoughts and move on. Ah, it, ah. 

01:13:10
KRISTI KANEL What thoughts did you repress? 

01:13:10
JOSEPH CHANG  Ah, wow, people got, people actually got blown up in this vehicle, just brief thought and brief emotion. 

01:13:20
KRISTI KANEL  What were the, what would be thoughts associated with- 

01:13:25
Climbing Cognitive Tree 

01:13:25
KRISTI KANEL - knowing somebody was killed? 

01:13:25
JOSEPH CHANG  Oh, oh, that's gonna be, ah, it's very extreme emotion, feeling, sadness, ah, just, it's just all kinds of mixed feeling that cannot be explained at one, and at one, you know, given time. 

01:13:50
KRISTI KANEL It, it does seem like it's hard for you, even now, two years later, to really think about it. 

01:13:55
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:13:55
KRISTI KANEL And that's part of that PTSD you were talking about. You know, that sounds like, you mentioned feeling numb, it almost seems like the PTSD starts as soon as the event happens. 

01:14:05
JOSEPH CHANG  Right. 

01:14:10
KRISTI KANEL And it begins there where you numb yourself, and then it just continues throughout after coming home. 

01:14:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:14:15
KRISTI KANEL  There's more escalation of it. When you were there, were there flashbacks and other symptoms that you're having now or when, when you're there, you're such in the heat of it, you don't have the thoughts and the recurring nightmares or any of those symptoms of PTSD? 

01:14:30
JOSEPH CHANG  That's the environment where you don't get to think and act according to your emotions. 

01:14:40
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:14:40
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, you. (crosstalk) 

01:14:40
KRISTI KANEL Is there hypervigilance which is another... (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
JOSEPH CHANG Yes. (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
KRISTI KANEL ...symptom of PTSD? 

01:14:45
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:14:45
KRISTI KANEL Seems like the numbness then and the hypervigilance, two symptoms of PTSD... (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
JOSEPH CHANG But, (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
KRISTI KANEL ...are there at the time. 

01:14:50
JOSEPH CHANG but more numbness. (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
KRISTI KANEL More numbness. (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
JOSEPH CHANG The reason, reason why is, ah, where I was, I was transferred to three different, ah, remote places in Iraq, we get mortar attacks all the time. Ah, mortar incoming is, ah, such an easy, ah, weapon for them to use, and it's hard to detect. 

01:15:10
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:15:10
JOSEPH CHANG So, they would use it. Uhm, I'll, I'll say two, three times a week, we get mortar incoming, and you just don't know where it's gonna land. And the, the noise of it, the impact of it is just tremendous. And, uhm, when you first get there within like three to four weeks, you are, you are hyper-vigilant. You are just so concerned or... (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:15:30
JOSEPH CHANG ...you're so worried. But after that, after a certain time, you just cannot be like that anymore because you gotta sleep, you gotta eat, you gotta do what you gotta do to, to continue your mission. And many times these mor, mortar landing, ah, misses a lot of people, usually end up damaging, you know, ah, generators, buildings, some unlucky people might get killed. But it's like a random chance. So, after a certain period of time, you start feeling numb, you do, you disregard it. It's, it's a dangerous thing, but you cannot focus on it. You have to move on. 

01:16:10
KRISTI KANEL It almost seems like what you're saying is that it began being a hypervigilant almost feeling like you could be prepared for things, but then after time, there's this realization that things are out of control, happening out of your control. 

01:16:25
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. 

01:16:25
KRISTI KANEL And it's almost like, ah, almost like, ah, an attempt to just survive it rather than escape it or master it. 

01:16:30
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:16:30
KRISTI KANEL And that is so typical of what we see with PTSD. 

01:16:35
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:16:35
KRISTI KANEL But, the way I'm thinking about it and maybe this makes sense to you, when you're first there, you're in this kind of acute stress. 

01:16:40
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:16:40
KRISTI KANEL Okay. And then a after time or so, a month or so as you get used to it, you almost go into, like a prisoner of war mentality... (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
KRISTI KANEL ...which is instead of escaping, they think about surviving. 

01:16:55
JOSEPH CHANG Right. Exactly. Uhm, you know, like the soldiers who are driving for a mission, ah, goes through a lot of this because they are on the road constantly and, ah, road-side bombs are the, ah, the biggest threat for us. And at the beginning of the deployment, they're all anxious, they're all nervous, who's gonna get hit, what's gonna happen, ah, am I gonna be able to survive the next day, everybody's nervous. 

01:17:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:17:25
JOSEPH CHANG But after two, three weeks of random missing of, ah, bombing or no bombing at all, you just, when the situation is so hard to predict, (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
KRISTI KANEL  Yes. 

01:17:40
JOSEPH CHANG they just become numb and they will just go on the next mission. Ah, whoever gets that bomb, bombing or that attack, ah, I mean, you know, it's just, we, it's just hard to, it's out of our control, it's out of our control. So, we had to deal with it. 

01:17:55
KRISTI KANEL What goes along with that statement? 

01:18:00
Cognitive Exploration 

01:18:00
KRISTI KANEL It's out of my control, is there a piece of, (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
JOSEPH CHANG It's a. (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
KRISTI KANEL is there another thought that goes along with that? (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
JOSEPH CHANG We, it's a war. It's a war and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
KRISTI KANEL So, like we just put with it. (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
JOSEPH CHANG we have to be, we have to be strong. 

01:18:10
KRISTI KANEL  Okay. That's what... (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
KRISTI KANEL ..you tell yourself, (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
KRISTI KANEL "I have to be strong." 

01:18:15
JOSEPH CHANG That's the whole military mentality. Otherwise, you are not gonna be able to be sane and stay strong and- 

01:18:25
Climbing Cognitive Tree 

01:18:25
JOSEPH CHANG - be able to. (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
KRISTI KANEL Well, what does strong mean? How would, how was that embedded in you, "I must be strong"? 

01:18:30
JOSEPH CHANG That is, disregard your emo, emotion. 

01:18:30
KRISTI KANEL That's what strength means... (crosstalk) 

01:18:35
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. (crosstalk) 

01:18:35
KRISTI KANEL ...disregard you emotions? 

01:18:35
JOSEPH CHANG All the concerns and worries are, ah, not gonna help your mission. So. 

01:18:40
KRISTI KANEL And now, how much is that thought a part of you now? I must be strong and not show my emotions? 

01:18:50
JOSEPH CHANG Right now, well, I've been, I've been living in, ah, in a much better place now, you know? Uhm, now, I got to appreciate where, you know, this civilian life, this, ah, new life that I have, ah. 

01:19:10
KRISTI KANEL But when this journalist asked you this and you had this flashback, how much did that thought... (crosstalk) 

01:19:15
JOSEPH CHANG Oh. 

01:19:15
KRISTI KANEL ...enter into your head? I must be strong and not share or show or have my have my emotion? 

01:19:20
JOSEPH CHANG  I went through a brief of flashback of death mentality, but now, I'm not. I do not tell myself I have to be strong or I have to disregard my emotion. Ah, luckily, I'm a Human Services Major, so I'm... (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:19:40
JOSEPH CHANG ...learning all about how important it is to be focusing my emotions as well. So, the education helped me being more balanced. But at that moment, I was a soldier again, and, ah, you know, seeing somebody dead, or hearing someone's death, and I have to move on without, you know, crying or talking about it is such a hard thing to do. It's just a torture sometimes. And, ah, that kinda came up in my head and I told them. (crosstalk) 

01:20:10
KRISTI KANEL What's the most torturous thing about that? What makes that so hard for you? 

01:20:15
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, someone that you knew, uhm, has passed away and, ah, and not, not in a, ah, good way but ah, ah, very brutal way of, of death and dying, and also thinking about their family, as well as. 

01:20:45
KRISTI KANEL  What did, what do you think about when you think- 

01:20:50
Climbing Cognitive Tree 

01:20:50
KRISTI KANEL - their family. And the fact that this was his torturous death? 

01:20:55
JOSEPH CHANG I think, ah, the situation, especially when he had only one month left... (crosstalk) 

01:21:05
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:21:05
JOSEPH CHANG ..in his deployment, he survived all the mortar attacks, (crosstalk) 

01:21:05
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:21:05
JOSEPH CHANG All the rocket launcher attacks, all this craziest thing. And then one month before he was going home, he, uhm, got, he got this, ah, accident and, ah, he, he died and, ah, yeah, that was very unfortunate because I helped him packing his stuff and, ah, he was all ready to go home and he was very happy to see his family. He sent this email, he sent this, ah, video message to their, to his family, so I've wrote this. (crosstalk) 

01:21:40
KRISTI KANEL You have such compassion and empathy for other people. 

01:21:45
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, I think it's my nature. 

01:21:50
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. 

01:21:50
Reflection 

01:21:50
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:21:50
KRISTI KANEL And it just, I'm just thinking, wow, someone with so much empathy must be filled with emotions and, you know, now that you're safe here, maybe the real strength comes with sharing your- 

01:22:00
Reframe 

01:22:00
KRISTI KANEL - emotions. And not running from them or repressing them, but having them and it takes strength to acknowledge that pain and, and deal with all those feelings, that's a new way to think about strength now maybe. Maybe back then, it was necessary to not have them so you could do your job. But now, maybe re, the real strength comes in, coming out of that PTSD. 

01:22:25
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:22:25
KRISTI KANEL Surviving it and, and having some emotions and acknowledging them to get beyond the PTSD. 

01:22:35
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:22:35
KRISTI KANEL Coz typically it's hard for people to overcome the PTSD without sharing their emotions and feeling them. A lot of the, the PTSD, typically- 

01:22:45
Educational Statement 

01:22:45
KRISTI KANEL - you have someone who is, or has flash backs and recurring nightmares. In other words, they re-experience the trauma... (crosstalk) 

01:22:50
JOSEPH CHANG Right 

01:22:50
KRISTI KANEL ...what, and then they alternate between repressing the trauma. 

01:22:55
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
KRISTI KANEL And there has to be, you wanna get to the point where they don't have uncontrollable flashbacks and they don't repress the, the feelings. 

01:23:05
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:23:05
KRISTI KANEL That would be the optimal, you know, way to help you get to the optimal point that you wanna be at. 

01:23:10
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:23:10
KRISTI KANEL You know, and maybe you have some thoughts that, well, it's been two years, I should be over it, or, but this. (laughing) (crosstalk) 

01:23:15
JOSEPH CHANG  Uhm, yeah, that's part of it but I know it's not gonna go away... (crosstalk) 

01:23:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:23:20
JOSEPH CHANG ...ah, forever. Ah, learning from the World War II veterans and the Vietnam veteran is, it's always there for them, you know. 

01:23:30
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:23:30
JOSEPH CHANG So it's hard. But, uhm, luckily, I have this passion to help, ah, other veterans and, ah, I truly believe that what goes around comes around and, ah, the support and the care that I wanted to provide, actually, came around and really healed a lot of my symptoms. (crosstalk) 

01:23:50
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:23:50
JOSEPH CHANG And, ah. (crosstalk) 

01:23:50
KRISTI KANEL  How do you think it did that? 

01:23:55
JOSEPH CHANG Oh, it's hard to tell. Ah, I just, I don't even know it happen but, ah, ah, after two semesters of having this, ah, organization, I just re, I just had a little time of, ah, looking back, and I just realized, uhm, I'm no longer going to the ah, hospital for counseling, I used to go to a, a hospital. (crosstalk) 

01:24:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:24:20
JOSEPH CHANG A hospital for counseling for about six months and I, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:24:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:24:20
JOSEPH CHANG didn't wanna do it because I really need to focusing on, ah, healing. (crosstalk) 

01:24:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:24:25
JOSEPH CHANG But, ah, without that, I was, ah, functioning normal, ah, happy, I could, happy emotion is something that's hard to get while you're going through PTSD. 

01:24:35
KRISTI KANEL Yes. 

01:24:35
JOSEPH CHANG But I'm very, ah, satisfied with my activities in school involvement... (crosstalk) 

01:24:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:24:40
JOSEPH CHANG ...and, ah, ah, having good time in classes. 

01:24:45
KRISTI KANEL It must be weird, then, to, out of the blue then, you talked to this journalist and then you have this resurgence... (crosstalk) 

01:24:50
JOSEPH CHANG  Exactly. 

01:24:55
KRISTI KANEL ...and these flashbacks, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:24:55
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. 

01:24:55
KRISTI KANEL Which might not be a bad thing. It might just mean that it's a communication to you, you know. Maybe I need to do something else, a little, something different, something more so, you know. 

01:25:05
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:25:05
KRISTI KANEL And I'm, you know, I was struck with the, the groups. Maybe they're so beneficial because you don't feel like you're wasting their time... (crosstalk) 

01:25:15
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:25:15
KRISTI KANEL ...like you felt, like didn't wanna tell other people because... (crosstalk) 

01:25:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:25:15
KRISTI KANEL ...you're wasting their time. 

01:25:15
JOSEPH CHANG Because we all know... (crosstalk) 

01:25:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:25:15
JOSEPH CHANG  we're one the same page, (crosstalk) 

01:25:20
KRISTI KANEL Correct. 

01:25:20
JOSEPH CHANG we don't have to explain anything, we just know. You know, that, that common interest, and common experience. 

01:25:25
KRISTI KANEL You know I see that, (crosstalk) 

01:25:25
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:25:25
KRISTI KANEL  that almost, that brings tears to my eyes because I'm thinking in a sense, how, how, I don't know what the word is, but it's, it's so poignant or it's so lovely in a sense that you have that unique, common bond with other human beings... (crosstalk) 

01:25:40
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:25:40
KRISTI KANEL ...that only you guys can connect to, I, I liken it to- 

01:25:45
Start Reframe 

01:25:45
KRISTI KANEL - my mother-child bond with my son like... (crosstalk) 

01:25:50
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. (laughs) 

01:25:50
KRISTI KANEL ...nobody else gets to have that bond with him but me and... (crosstalk) 

01:25:50
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:25:50
KRISTI KANEL ...it's so, I love that. (crosstalk) 

01:25:55
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:25:55
KRISTI KANEL And I'm wondering if that's something you can see about you... (crosstalk) 

01:26:00
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. 

01:26:00
KRISTI KANEL ...having that connectedness. It's so, it makes you so special and it makes... (crosstalk) 

01:26:00
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:26:00
KRISTI KANEL ...your relationship with them so special. 

01:26:05
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah, you know, cama, (crosstalk) 

01:26:05
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. 

01:26:05
JOSEPH CHANG camaraderie is, uhm, it's not in vain, it's, it's there. (crosstalk) 

01:26:10
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:26:10
JOSEPH CHANG You know, it's, ah. (crosstalk) 

01:26:10
KRISTI KANEL It's very spiritual 'coz it's... (crosstalk) 

01:26:15
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:26:15
KRISTI KANEL ...such a connectedness. 

01:26:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:26:15
KRISTI KANEL And that could be turned into like an inner peace and, you know, sort of talking and getting- 

01:26:20
Complete Reframe 

01:26:20
KRISTI KANEL - through these things. And I'm wondering then, if the journalist could trigger this in you because you don't have that camaraderie with the journalist. 

01:26:25
JOSEPH CHANG No. It's very. (crosstalk) 

01:26:30
KRISTI KANEL You might, you might not have had that reaction had it been a fellow veteran asking you that question. 

01:26:35
JOSEPH CHANG Right. Exactly, that's. (crosstalk) 

01:26:35
KRISTI KANEL That's an interesting phenomenon. 

01:26:35
JOSEPH CHANG  Thank you. Yeah, that's an interesting point of view, but, and that's true. If a... (crosstalk) 

01:26:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:26:40
JOSEPH CHANG ...fellow veteran would, would have asked me, I would have different, ah, emotions and attitude about that. (crosstalk) 

01:26:45
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:26:50
JOSEPH CHANG Uhm, yes, journal has test different, ah, take on that, yes. 

01:26:55
KRISTI KANEL Sure. Sure. I'm just impressed that you would work, be willing to talk to a journalist about that, 'coz this is so... (crosstalk) 

01:27:00
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:27:00
KRISTI KANEL ...painful and different, different, you know, difficult. What things do you think at this point where you're at now- 

01:27:05
Start Having Client Brainstorm Coping Strategies 

01:27:05
KRISTI KANEL  -since that happened with the journalist, and what do you think would be something you could do to just enhance and strengthen and help you in the future, you know, to, to prevent having any further kind of uncontrollable flashbacks or, or downswings. What else do you think you could be doing for yourself at this point? 

01:27:25
JOSEPH CHANG  I think, uhm, going through that kinda emotion is not, ah, really easy to, uhm, prevent or it's natural, I think, (crosstalk) 

01:27:40
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:27:40
JOSEPH CHANG I think it's natural. But, ah, what I'm doing right now that continuing what I'm doing, uhm, continuing, helping, or sharing, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:27:50
KRISTI KANEL When you share do you have, feel, feelings? 

01:27:50
JOSEPH CHANG  Uhm, we do not usually a lot about the, the war. We usually talk about the veteran issues, veteran, ah, like, ah, social events, something more positive. 

01:28:05
KRISTI KANEL Do you think that is, it, you think it would not be helpful to talk about your feelings related to action? 

01:28:10
JOSEPH CHANG No, I think it's gonna be, it's, it is healthy and we, we actually have done some... (crosstalk) 

01:28:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:28:15
JOSEPH CHANG ...and also we are planning also for that, but in a, in a school setting, in a, in this kinda busy environment... (crosstalk) 

01:28:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:28:25
JOSEPH CHANG ...it's just hard sometimes. We need to focus on, ah, we need to prepare and we have to kinda focus on ha, having some kinda special event for that. So I think that's gonna bring some more healing to these veterans. Uhm, but it's not just everyday talk. So, you know, it's a little different, but. (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
KRISTI KANEL What about for you... (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
JOSEPH CHANG For me. (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
KRISTI KANEL ...and your feelings and you being able to access them and share them and master them and- 

01:28:50
Caplan's Characteristic #7 

01:28:50
KRISTI KANEL - be in control of them? Coz it's kinda hard to be in control of your feelings if you don't have them, if you don't embrace them, and know them, and feel them, it's like you'll never really be in control of them and master them. 

01:29:10
JOSEPH CHANG Right. I think I've done a lot with my, ah, like reviewing my own emotion, check, re-checking my emotion... (crosstalk) 

01:29:15
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. 

01:29:20
JOSEPH CHANG ...while I went to, ah, VA hospital. 

01:29:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:29:20
JOSEPH CHANG Uhm, and it was. (crosstalk) 

01:29:20
KRISTI KANEL That was helpful? (crosstalk) 

01:29:25
JOSEPH CHANG That, that. (crosstalk) 

01:29:25
KRISTI KANEL The VA counseling was helpful? 

01:29:25
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah, that was helpful. 

01:29:25
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:29:25
JOSEPH CHANG That only thing, that only reason that I stop going and, ah, started in school was the travel, (crosstalk) 

01:29:30
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:29:30
JOSEPH CHANG  you know, I was in school, I had a busy schedule, I had to travel from Fullerton to Long Beach in the, in the, in the middle of the traffic and then come back to school, was very difficult. And, ah, I was thinking that we have 300 veterans in school, and if they all have to go the Long, Long Beach or other place, why don't we have something in, in school because we already have good number... (crosstalk) 

01:29:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:29:55
JOSEPH CHANG ...of people who could use it. So that was my motivation... (crosstalk) 

01:30:00
KRISTI KANEL I see. 

01:30:00
JOSEPH CHANG ...and this group of, ah, students actually was able, were able to talk to school and we got some promise from school that, ah, we'll have some kinda facility for veterans in the future, ah, near future... (crosstalk) 

01:30:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:30:15
JOSEPH CHANG ...that we'll be able to provide, ah, some kinda referrals and some kinda support and... (crosstalk) 

01:30:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:30:20
JOSEPH CHANG ...services for veterans. 

01:30:20
KRISTI KANEL You know, one thought I had was, uhm, going back to the strength thing and how you're strong if you don't have feelings and how that's kind of- 

01:30:30
Reframe 

01:30:30
KRISTI KANEL - embedded in soldiers. (crosstalk) 

01:30:30
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:30:30
KRISTI KANEL And, and back to the idea that maybe the real strength now is in having your feelings. 

01:30:35
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:30:35
KRISTI KANEL So that you can master them. I'm almost thinking wouldn't, and I know you like to help others. 

01:30:40
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:30:40
KRISTI KANEL I'm wondering, how would it be for you to take that role as role model, to show other veterans how to have feelings and that it's okay and necessary, so you would have the strength to be the one with the feelings so that they can let lose and have feelings... (crosstalk) 

01:31:00
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:31:00
KRISTI KANEL ...in a slow way. I'm not saying let it all out at once... (crosstalk) 

01:31:00
Caplan's Characteristic #6 

01:31:00
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:31:00
KRISTI KANEL  but letting them know through example that it's okay to have feelings. The real strength now comes in embracing those feelings, knowing them... (crosstalk) 

01:31:10
JOSEPH CHANG  Right. 

01:31:15
KRISTI KANEL ...like it's no longer strong to hold them in. (crosstalk) 

01:31:15
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:31:15
KRISTI KANEL 'Coz in the sense that we can do... (crosstalk) 

01:31:20
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:31:20
KRISTI KANEL ...'coz it prevents you from being fully yourself. 

01:31:20
Reframe 

01:31:20
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. 

01:31:20
KRISTI KANEL  'Coz if you're, if you're repressing any part yourself, you're not fully alive and maybe you're not, you are unable to have full emotional expression and joy... (crosstalk) 

01:31:35
JOSEPH CHANG Exactly. 

01:31:35
KRISTI KANEL ...if you're repressing anything. 

01:31:35
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. Actually thanks for acknowledging that and I, I think that's a great point. Uhm, yes, that's part of, ah, my mission. (crosstalk) 

01:31:45
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:31:45
JOSEPH CHANG Uhm, is that soldiers, ah, among soldiers could lose and be, be who they are easily. 

01:31:55
KRISTI KANEL Yes. 

01:31:55
JOSEPH CHANG But when they are around as students, a faculty, or non-military people, they have to be, they have, they have to stand, stand tall and look good and this macho... (crosstalk) 

01:32:05
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:32:05
JOSEPH CHANG ...mentality and they are heroes, this stereotypes, this, this, you know, feeding from them, you know, all these messages, ah, make them very, uhm, unemotional, just like you pointed out. So among the veterans now, ah, I see many, ah, veterans are start losing their kinda strong attitude, (crosstalk) 

01:32:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:32:25
JOSEPH CHANG you know, and they start becoming who really they are. 

01:32:30
KRISTI KANEL Well, my idea is, change the definition of strong... (crosstalk) 

01:32:35
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:32:35
KRISTI KANEL ...like it's not necessarily strong to not have emotions... (crosstalk) 

01:32:35
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. 

01:32:35
KRISTI KANEL  that, coz you're cutting off a piece of yourself. (crosstalk) 

01:32:40
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:32:40
KRISTI KANEL And if you're cutting off half of you, you're,- 

01:32:40
Reframe 

01:32:40
KRISTI KANEL  you're only half of a person and that can't be the strongest you that you can be. 

01:32:45
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. Right. 

01:32:50
KRISTI KANEL And so that might be another way that I, I hope you can maybe look at a little bit. 

01:32:50
JOSEPH CHANG Right. Actually, I don't think we really use that word anymore. (crosstalk) 

01:32:55
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:32:55
JOSEPH CHANG Strong or strength. 

01:32:55
KRISTI KANEL  But it's implicit. (crosstalk) 

01:33:00
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:33:00
KRISTI KANEL The idea I have to stand up... (crosstalk) 

01:33:00
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:33:00
KRISTI KANEL ...and be a hero. (crosstalk) 

01:33:00
JOSEPH CHANG So embedded message in, in their, (crosstalk) 

01:33:05
KRISTI KANEL In a sense. 

01:33:05
JOSEPH CHANG in their language and thoughts. 

01:33:05
KRISTI KANEL You could be a forerunner in that and be a role model for people on how to be, how to have pain. (crosstalk) 

01:33:10
JOSEPH CHANG Hmm. 

01:33:10
KRISTI KANEL That feelings make up the whole of you, and that's really, a whole you is stronger than a half of you. 

01:33:15
JOSEPH CHANG  Right. That might be a little challenging. 

01:33:20
KRISTI KANEL Of course, this whole thing is challenging. (crosstalk) 

01:33:25
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:33:25
KRISTI KANEL And my gosh... (crosstalk) 

01:33:25
JOSEPH CHANG But, ah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:33:25
KRISTI KANEL ...you, you survived something most of us never even get close to and so I wanna, just I wanna personally thank you for your service... (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
JOSEPH CHANG Well. (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
KRISTI KANEL ...and being willing to go do that for us. 

01:33:35
JOSEPH CHANG Well, thanks for listening. (crosstalk) 

01:33:35
KRISTI KANEL Is there any, anything else that you can think of that you wanna do or that you think will help you at this point before we kind of end our session? 

01:33:45
JOSEPH CHANG Uh hmm. No I think, ah, uhm, uhm, I think my feeling was felt... (crosstalk) 

01:33:55
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:33:55
JOSEPH CHANG ...and, ah, my, ah, story was heard... (crosstalk) 

01:33:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:33:55
JOSEPH CHANG ...and ah, I feel good and, ah, I will continually do what doing and, ah. (crosstalk) 

01:34:00
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Is there anything else that you could do, like one little thing- 

01:34:05
Get Commitment 

01:34:05
KRISTI KANEL - you could add on to what you're already doing? One, one small movement, what, what could you do differently? 

01:34:10
JOSEPH CHANG  Well, it's just like you, you, you said, uhm, I like to be, ah, be a role model... (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:34:20
JOSEPH CHANG ...ah, as far as have, having an emotion, (crosstalk) 

01:34:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:34:25
JOSEPH CHANG you know, being, ah.(crosstalk) 

01:34:25
KRISTI KANEL Do you think you can try that? 

01:34:25
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:34:25
KRISTI KANEL Even felt. (crosstalk) 

01:34:25
JOSEPH CHANG In a full, full human being, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:34:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:34:30
JOSEPH CHANG Again, and enjoying life. (crosstalk) 

01:34:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:34:30
JOSEPH CHANG And, ah, I would like to invite, ah, other veterans as, as, as a part of our, ah, another, new team, new group, ah, so we could enjoy, ah, school environment again. 

01:34:45
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:34:45
JOSEPH CHANG Yeah. 

01:34:45
KRISTI KANEL That's nice. Right. Okay thanks. 

01:34:45
JOSEPH CHANG  Thank you. 

01:34:50
Chapter Eleven Debriefing of Joseph's Session 

01:34:50
KRISTI KANEL  Okay. Now that I've finished the session with Joseph, I thought we would do just a little debriefing again with my colleague, Glennda Gilmour and Joseph, and kind of get a feel of, of some of her observations and some of Joseph's reactions. So, Glennda, as you watched this session, what are some things you've noticed about, uhm, the use of basic attending skills and especially cognitive exploration? 

01:35:20
GLENNDA GILMOUR You explored his cognitions well through reflection that was traumatic for you, what were your thoughts specifically guiding, ah, Joseph into what he was thinking, what thoughts that you repressed. Uhm, you constantly explore what this meant, the personal experience. 

01:35:40
KRISTI KANEL Do you remember what some of the cognitions were that Joseph expressed to those questions? 

01:35:45
GLENNDA GILMOUR That to be strong was not to cry, not to show any emotions. 

01:35:50
KRISTI KANEL Now, how was that used later on in terms of any of those therapeutic interactions statements? 

01:35:55
GLENNDA GILMOUR You made it into a reframe, I say. (crosstalk) 

01:35:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:35:55
GLENNDA GILMOUR And that was the strength, actually. In fact, it was something you could use. 

01:36:00
KRISTI KANEL Yes. And that is what we wanna do in a reframe, is take their original frame of reference or thought and then just change it around just a little bit to allow the person to think differently. In fact, Joseph, do you feel that that was effective for you, that particular reframe? 

01:36:15
JOSEPH CHANG Yes, it was, ah, it was very, ah, helpful, uhm, made me think again, I haven't thought about it, so it was good inside for me to, to carry, carry with me. 

01:36:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Now, did you, uhm, see or observe any other kinds of therapeutic interaction statements, empowerment the, uhm, educational, anything like that? 

01:36:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR Educational, yes, you'd clarified the various, uhm, PTSD symptoms such as numbness, such as hypervigilance, uhm. But you also did, ah, well, you clarified the, his educational statements but also that it occurred a month afterwards versus what happened right at the time. 

01:37:05
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Try, I tried to tie in the, the previous situation in which it, it started the PTSD symptoms, or what it's known as acute stress disorder. (crosstalk) 

01:37:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR Right. Right. 

01:37:15
KRISTI KANEL And then how that has developed into a delayed PTSD reaction. 

01:37:20
GLENNDA GILMOUR Right. 

01:37:20
KRISTI KANEL What, how did that fit for you, or what did you do with that information when I educated you about that? 

01:37:25
JOSEPH CHANG  Ah, that it's already known, it's normal. 

01:37:30
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. Okay. 

01:37:30
JOSEPH CHANG Ah, and, ah, ah, what I'm going through, ah, this particular, through particular, ah, precipitating event, ah, happened to other people as well. So it kinda gave me a sense that, ah, yes, I could, this is something I can work and, ah, get better. 

01:37:55
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:37:55
JOSEPH CHANG Uhm. 

01:37:55
KRISTI KANEL And that's one of the reasons we provide those educational statements, is to help normalize events and normalize, for example, PTSD symptoms, and that makes evidently, Joseph, you're that would make you feel like you could overcome this... (crosstalk) 

01:38:05
JOSEPH CHANG  Right. 

01:38:10
KRISTI KANEL ...because it's more normalized? 

01:38:10
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:38:10
KRISTI KANEL Did you experience or feel there was any validation or support, comments from me at all? 

01:38:15
JOSEPH CHANG Yes, your knowledge of these PTSD symptoms, your experience working with, ah, ah, similar individuals like me. (crosstalk) 

01:38:25
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:38:25
JOSEPH CHANG Gave me, ah, ah, confirmation, (crosstalk) 

01:38:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:38:25
JOSEPH CHANG of, of, and also confidence that, yes, you know, you do know what you're talking about and... (crosstalk) 

01:38:30
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:38:30
JOSEPH CHANG ...I could, uhm, might what I'm saying, it could be heard, ah, thoroughly and. (crosstalk) 

01:38:35
KRISTI KANEL That's an interesting point that... (crosstalk) 

01:38:40
JOSEPH CHANG Yes. 

01:38:40
KRISTI KANEL ...education statement could make the client feel confident because I know what I'm talking about, and therefore, it, what does confidence do for you, do you think? 

01:38:50
JOSEPH CHANG Uhm that I, I'm not gonna waste my time... (crosstalk) 

01:38:55
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:38:55
JOSEPH CHANG ...and we are, we're gonna be, we could be productive together throughout this... (crosstalk) 

01:38:55
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:38:55
JOSEPH CHANG ...session. (crosstalk) 

01:38:55
KRISTI KANEL  Okay. 

01:39:00
JOSEPH CHANG So that's, ah, some, some kinda hope and, ah, and positive, ah, posit, positive thoughts. 

01:39:05
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Glennda, did you notice anything else that you would like to mention or that you thought was particularly helpful or. 

01:39:10
GLENNDA GILMOUR Well, in a sense, you showed, you gave him power. 

01:39:15
KRISTI KANEL How so? (crosstalk) 

01:39:15
GLENNDA GILMOUR What he thought was sharing emotions and talking him was maybe a weakness, but you empowered him that he can control this now, he can... (crosstalk) 

01:39:25
KRISTI KANEL Hmm. 

01:39:25
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...choose where he shares, who he shares it to and when. 

01:39:30
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. Did, did you notice that, Joseph, that concept, that if you, if the emotions happen to you with the trigger... (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
JOSEPH CHANG Hmm. 

01:39:35
KRISTI KANEL ...like what happened with you, you're out of control of them? But if you take charge of the emotions and embrace them, it, it's an, an empowerment type of process. 

01:39:45
JOSEPH CHANG Right. It's something that I realized once again that soldiers do have emotional problems and, ah, it's a big problem and, ah, you're reframing that, you've mentioning that gives me, ah, uhm, an insight that, wow, yeah, this is something that I need to work with my veterans as well as myself. 

01:40:05
KRISTI KANEL  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:40:10
JOSEPH CHANG So, it's, it's a new agenda for me... (crosstalk) 

01:40:10
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

01:40:10
JOSEPH CHANG ...and, uhm, it, ah, made me realize that this is something, some, something that I have to work, ah, continually. So it was good. It was good to hear that. Yeah. 

01:40:25
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Is there anything else, Glennda, that you wanted to make a comment on or, Joseph, anything else you want to make a comment on? 

01:40:30
GLENNDA GILMOUR Well, uhm, you did a lot of clarifying like, uhm, what was the most torturous thing for you. You went into where some people may be afraid to go 'coz you don't wanna open up your client... (crosstalk) 

01:40:40
JOSEPH CHANG Well, right. 

01:40:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...but you showed you were willing to go there with him. 

01:40:45
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:40:45
KRISTI KANEL And that's part of climbing the cognitive tree. (crosstalk) 

01:40:45
GLENNDA GILMOUR Uh hmm. 

01:40:45
KRISTI KANEL You really wanna understand it from the client's point of view. And eventhough I. (crosstalk) 

01:40:50
GLENNDA GILMOUR You have to be willing. 

01:40:50
KRISTI KANEL Well, eventhough I can never truly know what went on there... (crosstalk) 

01:40:55
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:40:55
KRISTI KANEL ...and I'm not quite sure I want to, but I wanna try to do it as much as you're willing to let me know what's going on in your head. 

01:41:05
JOSEPH CHANG Right. That's good point. Yes, she did explore the area that is sensitive, that is, ah, challenging. But because you did it, I was able to break the door and, ah, started thinking about it. 

01:41:15
KRISTI KANEL Uh hmm. 

01:41:15
JOSEPH CHANG And there's a lot hidden there, so I appreciate that. 

01:41:20
GLENNDA GILMOUR And you weren't alone, the support was, she was with you... (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
JOSEPH CHANG Right. 

01:41:25
GLENNDA GILMOUR ...when you had opened the door. 

01:41:25
JOSEPH CHANG Right. And, ah, I fully feel that I was heard and, ah, just being able to be her, you know, somebody hearing my story and understand, ah, that's empowering, I think to, me. So, it's good. 

01:41:40
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Well, thank you. 

01:41:40
GLENNDA GILMOUR You're welcome. 

01:41:40
KRISTI KANEL Thank you very much. 

01:41:40
JOSEPH CHANG  Thank you.
