Stephen Gilligan, PhD 

00:00:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Umm… it's important that you be able to hear. So what that gentle was just modeling umm… it's perfectly okay and I actually ask you that in point sometimes when we do a little bit more inner work, the voices drop to say uh… louder please and we can practice that. This will be our first exercise. So on the count on three, you can all in (inaudible ) like say, louder please. Oh, that's very good. So uh… this is Candy. Umm… still go again, candy is a therapist and uh… part of this workshop. Anything you'd like to say and introduce yourself? 

00:01:25
CANDY Let's see. Umm… I've been working with Steve over, I mean, he's been a big influence on me for the past 15 years. I live in Tucson now. 

00:01:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She was eight years old at the time. 

00:01:40
CANDY I live Tucson now but I haven't seen you in four years. 

00:01:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Four years, yeah. So you were in the workshop yesterday, that's during the afternoon, you came up oh, you emailed me and said can you volunteer and I said sure. So about maybe, maybe we'd do some good work here today and uh… as I mentioned I just want to take two minutes just to make the most general comment umm… when I talk about the process of what we call generative trends, I think the distinctive feature about generative trans that distinguishes it from umm… traditional hypnosis and Ericksonian hypnosis is we see it first and foremost as a process of creativity and it's really organized around the question, what is it that you must want to create in your life. And when we look at creativity, we see that umm… contrary to the idea that it's often promulgate in hypnosis, it's not just the unconscious mind that is sufficient for creativity that creativity really is a conversation between two types of intelligent and, and two worlds if you will. This sort of the, the visionary dreamer intelligence of the creative unconscious which I think is sort of tuned into for lack of a better term, a sort of a quantum world where you have infinite possibilities and then we need another intelligence that represents what might be different in teaching (inaudible ) cause the realist and the critic and somebody who can translate the dream into some sense of action and then be able to uh… work with it until it gets to an optimal state. So I don't use the term hypnosis anymore. In my most recent book, Generative Trance sort of formally umm… uh… dismiss the term because I think it's too irreparably tied with the notion that the therapist holds the conscious mind and is there primarily to control the unconscious mind which is held by the client. I think that is really not a very helpful way of thinking about things. But the therapist is there in the generative trance view to be able to support a conversation, you might say uh… between these two types of intelligence. And so I think what you'd probably see, I mean and we never know exactly how a session is going to open up uh… where you probably see any transfer that we do is umm… short term where, where dipping into that creative quantum world and then seeing what uh… came out of that and then seeing how that might be used for some sort of creative action out in the world. Umm… the advantage of, sorry, I think we got to turn this down a little bit. Uh… the advantage of working in small chunks, two additional advantage is you can get a lot of feedback about the specific techniques, if you will that the client is using and one of the things that Erickson taught us is the work to sustain itself much better if the techniques… Can somebody work with this microphone? Now, I don't think it's feedback. Sorry? 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, you, you want to get feedback so that the majority of the techniques, the content that is being used in the work is coming from the client and then secondly you always want to make sure that it's a positive experience. You don't want to people to be traumatized themselves. So uh… so by working in short chunks, you don't have that much opportunity to spin out too much. Okay, that's my, my morning rap here and thank you for being so patient and umm… and maybe, maybe we can just begin uh… in a general way. You can, you know, give me a minute or two, your best says about, if this was one thing that you could create in the session that you'd be thinking tomorrow uh… next week month, I was really great, I was able to, what would that be? 

00:07:05
CANDY It's interesting how it keeps changing but I think that, that this iteration is about owning umm… I don't like using the warrior but I owning my power in a way that it doesn't feel oppressive. 

00:07:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You don't have to say worrier, right. 

00:07:25
CANDY No, I want to just no worrier. Because she's that too. 

00:07:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN To both of them I would like to say sincerely welcome, to your worrier. I'm sure, she carries a lot of the power, so welcome and to the warrior, the sister uh… welcome, welcome, welcome. What happens when, when I say that? 

00:08:00
CANDY I never thought of her as a sister. 

00:08:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Interesting type of sisterhood huh. 

00:08:10
CANDY Yeah. I have a different kind of sister than… 

00:08:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, you have a sister? 

00:08:20
CANDY I have a sister. 

00:08:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And she more a worrier or a warrior? 

00:08:25
CANDY Umm… yeah. 

00:08:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Thank you for clarifying that. 

00:08:30
CANDY I would say worrier who's worrier is umm… not refined. Scary. 

00:08:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So she, she helds a lot but really nothing positive comes out of her, yeah, great. So if you, if you had this partnership? 

00:08:50
CANDY If I had… 

00:08:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN If you had this partnership? If you were feeling the sense of, of wholeness within yourself what, what would that allow you to do in your life that would be just fantastic? To say, well, now I got this, this in a work and one of the great things it allowed me to do that I really wanted to do out in out in the world was… 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
CANDY Uh… umm… really show up fully. 

00:09:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And where would that be? 

00:09:40
CANDY Uh… I'm thinking in a number of different arenas. One is in uh… my work with groups. 

00:09:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great, can we just pause there. You are not from California, so, we have to go a little bit slow. Something about really showing up with this sort of the, the ying softness of the part that worries and the Yang sisters. 

00:10:15
[sil.] 

00:10:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I wonder if we can just close our eyes and both of us breathe with that. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And whatever is needed to create that reality I would like to say welcome, welcome, welcome. And I certainly am curious and I imagine that you be curious of in terms of who shows up, what are all the different parts of presents when you start talking about living in this integrated way where you'd really be showing up for example in your professional life. 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… for, for what it's worth uh… I just happen to notice a blue water fall uh… was, was appeared as I was talking about then I'm wondering what appeared for you? 

00:11:45
CANDY I'm just having this heart, my heart's pounding. 

00:11:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So, when we talk about welcoming all the parts that are integral to showing up, your heart starts beating, isn't that interesting? Maybe yeah, you can open your eyes and think that's an interesting little first chunk. We talk about the really wanting to be fully present out in the world. By the way on a scale from one to ten, if you were to a number come that represents how much you really would like that, what number comes? 

00:12:40
CANDY That's a ten. 

00:12:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Ten. And where did that number come from? 

00:12:50
CANDY Some where up here. 

00:12:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Some where up here. 

00:12:50
CANDY Yeah. 

00:12:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Did it come as a color? Did it come as a sound? Did it come… I know, it's not easy uh… typical question. 

00:13:00
CANDY No, it pfft… 

00:13:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Just pfft, wow. 

00:13:05
CANDY Showed up. 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Welcome. And so to that uh… part of you that just went, welcome, welcome, welcome. So before we sort of move to a next step umm… I'd like to ask and I'm asking myself these questions too. In terms of soft connection in a sense of secure, security uh… on a scale of one to ten, just notice what number pops up in terms of how secure and self-connected you feel right now? 

00:14:10
CANDY Right now. 

00:14:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:14:15
CANDY Uh… probably like a fiveish. 

00:14:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Probably about a five. 

00:14:15
CANDY Ish. 

00:14:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That same place that went shoo. If it was to go shoo or maybe whoo and maybe whish, it is what by the way that, when somebody says, probably that's sort of indicating that's more of a cognitive conjecture because to the unconscious, it's, it's there or it's not. You know, so I think, I think maybe or probably. So you know, really and it's look at the difference between the answers that come from the cognitive effort or the answers that come from we begin to consult with our inner, inner wisdom. 

00:15:00
CANDY So I'm noticing is that the ten I mean, I could really feel it and then, and then everything got yeah but, you know. 

00:15:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't it nice that you know, you have such an interesting team. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sort of like a family. I'm sorry to use the F word so (inaudible ). 

00:15:30
CANDY Because you know it's my family. 

00:15:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Does your unconscious went like that but. But we're, we're really talking about your, your family. Whether, whether it would be to have your… Wow isn't that great that your organism just took a deep breath? You noticed that, huh? 

00:15:55
CANDY Yeah. 

00:15:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Don't you find that really interesting that your organism took a deep breath? When that part of the idea of being your own family? 

00:16:15
CANDY Yeah yeah. 

00:16:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN No wonder if we could just close our eyes and breathe like that and all those different places that brought water falls and sparkling and tens and fives. Just notice what images, what feelings, move through that begin to contribute to planting this beautiful tree of your own family. Sort of like lighting sixth, sixth candle today, Monica? Sixth, sixth. 

00:17:10
CANDY Seven. 

00:17:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Seven. Lucky seven. 

00:17:15
[sil.] 

00:17:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Much prayer and maybe you'd like to open your eyes again, tell me what you touched there. 

00:17:30
CANDY Seven is lucky for me. 

00:17:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry? 

00:17:35
CANDY Seven is lucky. 

00:17:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:17:35
CANDY For me. 

00:17:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Can you like the manor? 

00:17:40
CANDY You know, I, I read the first night but then here I am. So yeah… 

00:17:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So we're already on lucky number seven. And I was actually eating dinner with Rachel last night who said it was a seventh and uh… she was saying that manor represents the tree right? That you're saying that. That's what I was hearing anyway. So this is something about creating your own inner family. 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN While every member has its place and every part is able to work in, in some sort of positive connection. Such an interesting uh… image to dream about, to breathe about. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Ready for the next question? 

00:19:00
CANDY Can I say something? 

00:19:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, please. 

00:19:05
CANDY I just feel like I've been kicking out certain parts that need to be at the table. 

00:19:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You're, you're getting out. 

00:19:10
CANDY I've been kicking out. 

00:19:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. Yeah, we, we tend to do that. 

00:19:20
CANDY And the meanness. I don't like. 

00:19:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So it's nice to invite them all to tea. One lump or two? 

00:19:40
[sil.] 

00:19:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So that the next curiosity that I had that was something in the workshop yesterday, we were talking a little bit about what I call somatic models and somatic model is asking the body to simply represent a goal, resource, a symptom uh… a relationship with a posture and a simple movement. So it sort of gives us the without words uh… archetype or representation and when we clear out all the words and the stories, it really can open, I think uh… much clearer, deeper space. So I'm wondering, I, I just find myself wondering at the end of this and what would be, what would be your sense of a good time scope? Would it be uh… a week from now, would it be a month from now? Would it be in the sense of, oh I'm just kicking butt in my group and I've got fire, I've got sweetness, I've got softness, I've got vulnerability, I got the whole package. Would that be, do you think realistically uh… a week from now, month from now, beginning of next year and just notice again what your sort of inner imagination might bring to your awareness? 

00:21:30
CANDY So umm… what I'd like is for it to happen for my meeting next week. 

00:21:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So you'd like it in, in your sort of inner imagination, does it say next week? Does… 

00:21:45
CANDY Maybe, maybe a little bit of putting my toe in the water, next week. 

00:21:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. I like that. 

00:21:55
CANDY And testing the water. 

00:21:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. That's great. That's a beautiful image for me. Thanks for sharing it. 

00:22:05
CANDY Fully formed. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
CANDY I don't know March comes to mind. 

00:22:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN March. And who would you like to invite that you is to ask your body wisdom to help you find the somatic model for when in that place perhaps early March that you have this realization that I've done it, I did it. What would be your somatic response to that? 

00:22:55
CANDY Uh… I got to take this off. 

00:22:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You start taking off your clothes now. You better be in California then. 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:15
CANDY Umm… you know there is a… There is something here. 

00:23:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It's like Bruce Lee. Oh your kung fu is more powerful than mine. 

00:23:30
CANDY Like I'm yeah… 

00:23:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great. I'm just, I'm just gonna ask you to do that as a slow rhythmic movement. Sort of like a Balinese trance dance. And just feel that, and I say beautiful, ancient, organismic wisdom shows you, this is how might be somatically organizing. Find the movement and just do a nice, graceful, slow. Sometimes it can be so slow that it feels consciously that it's not even moving, even though it is moving slowly towards March. Even though, it is unfolding beautiful pattern through December, January, and as you feel that movement, you find a nice graceful, nothing static. Something center and feeling as you move through maybe exchanging and letting the other hand come forward. And the other hand come back giving to experiment with all the different ways. That's good, that's great. That should beginning to create with all of the different parts, the part that used to be called anxious, the part that used to be called angry all moving together as a family. And each movement of the hands, opens a new image. Relaxes an old feeling, allows a deeper flow from the deepest part of the family of all families. The deepest part that sends you new images, the family could be like this, the family can be like that, a family can be like that. You know, all the while you find yourself just breathing, listening, letting your organism. Beautiful, old wisdom to keep moving through time, letting the family of all families bringing in the images of what a daughter looks like, how daughter responds, how sister connects with her sister and to feel your body knows they can have that beautiful sense of a creative love. So many transformation. 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So many integrations that bring in something into your heart and all the music from (inaudible ) starts and stops. And then a different music from another world begins. So nice to feel at home with every part. The open hand, the fears, protective hand, the body's integration that allows you to bring it all together into a new family. That would be much great. That's great. So nice to witness that all. And to feel when you're looking to moving to new territory where you really can best present, best enact. Not to those voices or those voices. But to that beautiful inner security that is able to move in a careful, gentle, graceful way. Teaching you so many things about what to hold in your hand, what to extend, out into the world. How to find the process of integration. Such a nice thing for the family of families at the root of your wisdom tree, the seventh candle. Show how sisters stand together. Shows you new images about are families really can work in that place two opposite sides. Start they seem each other and then come a little bit further into both sides recognize each other and finding just the right distance with the two opposing sides to begin that process that each is part of that same circle and whether they come together to touch is really an open question isn't it? Don't really know uh… they are going to teach you what they need to be comfortably. With that sense of differentiated wholeness. That's good. Maybe a creative intelligence can take another minute or so just to show you with that somatic dance, just what each part needs. The best names, the best ways of visually, imagining their relationship to your heart. A need for open space. A need to connect deeply and both give and receive with the heart. It's a beautiful thing to let your organism teach you. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Just what each member of that inner family most needs to be free. Most needs to stand out to be fully present and each has its own days. Each has its own way, that's good. That's good. Such a nice thing. It teaches you not too fast. Because of more distance. Such a beautiful thing. You can see how it would create a both anger and anxiety if that wasn't listened to. And what a pleasure to listen, to follow. Each part has precisely its own way. That's good, that's good. And you can feel between that's good, so nice to feel where your organism begins that breath of integration. Now you really, really can enjoy that breath of integration. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:35:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Very cool, huh. So nice to listen and so as you look forward into the coming days and weeks, you can feel what it's like to be taking each step with those inner connections. Take a few moment just to enjoy what you've learnt. Now when your organism is ready, take a nice breath with your eyes open. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wouldn't it be nice if every family taught its children to do this? In my family we had to kneel down and say, umm… five decades of the rosary every night. I think you would have been better served doing something like this. How about you? That is so cool. 

00:36:55
CANDY Yeah, it's very cool. 

00:37:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That is so cool. 

00:37:00
CANDY Very cool. 

00:37:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I just was umm… umm… amazed that what your hands were doing, what your whole body was doing. Uh… how about you? 

00:37:10
CANDY That was pretty cool. Yeah. 

00:37:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Anything more you'd like to say about that? 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:25
CANDY It seemed that there was a point at which 

00:37:30
[sil.] 

00:37:35
CANDY Uh… the meanness needed something really soft. 

00:37:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The meanness needed something soft. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
CANDY And… 

00:37:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Nice touch of organism takes a nice breath. Each time that you speak the truth, your organism takes a nice breath. You noticed that? Every time your words are truthful, the body settles. What else? 

00:38:10
[sil.] 

00:38:15
CANDY Uh… I can just call her the good girl. 

00:38:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good girl? 

00:38:20
CANDY One who has to be the good girl need a little more oomph. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry, I didn't hear that. Can you speak a little bit louder? 

00:38:35
CANDY Oomph. 

00:38:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm sorry. I think the people in the back would like to hear that. 

00:38:45
CANDY Oomph. 

00:38:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow. I like it. That's the way hmm-mm, hmm-mm, I like it. Oops sorry. 

00:39:00
CANDY So and, and extension. 

00:39:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw that. That's what I was sensing too. So they, they really need each other in a, I guess would be a practical way of saying that, is that, you think that, that? 

00:39:20
CANDY Yeah, well and I'm trying to get rid of that side for a long time. 

00:39:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:39:25
CANDY Just shut up. 

00:39:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So how long do you think it's gonna be before you are surprised that the anxiety has come back? 

00:39:40
CANDY Oh. 

00:39:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN To really speak in the matter of seconds or minutes, hours, certainly not days, right? 

00:39:50
CANDY A couple of hours. 

00:39:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN A couple of hours. That's my prophecy also that, that these parts will continue to return to your inner family. Isn't that good to know? And that one you notice and anxious are really pissed off and I don't know what to do? How to express it that which are learning here today is what you can do. That's a sort of a red flag, oh this part of me needs some human community. You know, because one part is anxious it means, it's coming out of the unconscious but it hasn't been accepted by human presence yet. So it's only half human. It doesn't have human value yet. So where, if we were to imagine where would it be, would you be like in your own thinking, oh, shit what did I do in front of all those people or… I'm psychic. 

00:41:20
CANDY No, I think, you just love it. 

00:41:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't that great to know that, that, that those parts of you are going to return over and over? Sin, sincerely, I'm not speaking sadistically just descriptively. 

00:41:40
CANDY No when I, so I get the sense that, that's the practice is to transform that each and every time. 

00:41:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So maybe you can just do a mini process for a minute or so where you can invite the anxious part forward. 

00:42:05
CANDY That's not. 

00:42:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then notice as it comes forward, how you slip into your organismic intelligence and how your body just makes a movement. Hey, little sister. 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And notice what you need to do in terms of relaxing your face and your forehead, dropping your hips. 

00:42:55
[sil.] 

00:43:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So that you do from all of the heart, earned intelligence as, as a woman that carries the resources that you didn't have as a little girl. And I'm sorry that the grown ups weren't there to help you. I'm really happy that you stuck with it and you've been working really hard and so you're here now. Just imagine yourself as all of that you've worked so hard, to cultivate in your life. Welcoming the anxious part. Sweetheart and just notice with sort of movement in your body that your body would like to make in order to greet it or connect with it. You can do with your eyes closed. You can use my voice, my words for any support or if you don't need it, you can just let my voice wash through you. 

00:44:40
[sil.] 

00:44:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Making all of these parts that have waited so long could be part of a loving human community. I want to say with my whole being welcome, welcome. 

00:45:10
[sil.] 

00:45:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Welcome. I'm noticing your own balance of the two sides. (inaudible ) fire, gentle and flowing as water. Welcome. So the more they show up, the more your own mature, harder and presence just hey welcome. And you may want to move your arms sometimes to so that you feel your mind is in your body and working through your body. And then your body starts to having a mind of its own and becomes the beat system and teaching you how fast, what pathway, what connections with others resources are important to pick up along the way. To absorbing into full positive human family, family.

STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's good. And probably 10, 20 maybe even 30 times each day. Have those little signals, just coming back now. Oh boy, guess who's coming back to visit the family? Hi, hi, hi. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And when the anger that hides in the background say you're welcome too. You two are such lovely sisters and it's nice to be part of the sisterhood.

00:48:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great. So just notice what you have learnt here today through yourself, what your organism has taught you. And just, it could be one or two things in particular, simple things that you most want to be remembering and practicing. Just notice what that is.

STEPHEN GILLIGAN And to sense if there is any vows that you would like to make to yourself. My life is lived from the vows that we make. 

00:49:20

00:49:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The vows that we make as children are usually are not going to do that. I'm not going to be like that. So nice to feel the power of a grown up can make a positive life out. I will, I will. 

00:49:50
[sil.] 

00:49:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I will. Don't you feel the whole family applauding? 

00:50:05
CANDY Yes.

00:50:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it so great? 

00:50:20
CANDY Thanks. 

00:50:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You were just fantastic. One of Erickson's old saying was what a nice thing that now you can memorize that feeling. And take a look around out into the room and just really feel through your body what comes back to you. So this is another type of family. 

00:50:55

00:51:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Doesn't she look beautiful? 

00:51:05

00:51:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great work. 

00:51:20
CANDY Thank you. 

00:51:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great work. How many of you got therapy from this session? 

00:51:35
[sil.] 

00:51:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I, I really think as therapists our first job just to hear call (inaudible ) say this is to get therapy from our clients. I'm really sincere because people get better by giving, you know and when every time that we are able to witness the beauty of a person human being what they got through, what they have been able to do, who they really are, we should drink that in because it's only when it touches other people that it becomes real in the world. So umm… thank you. I've given you a lot of great therapy. So I hope you could see we're, we're sort of doing this process of, of moving between the two languages and also thinking of trance as a sort of a fluid safe space where all of the different parts of the whole that have been in a wounded, broken state are able to be invited in and we are looking to validate and value each part that shows up and then we're looking to have each part feel the connection with the other parts and then feel the flow that goes through those parts as a way of thinking about integration. The integration is not about oneness, it's about a differentiated wholeness. Uh… so that we have one plus one equals three, okay. Nice work if you can get it. So I'll end at that note. I hope this was uh… helpful for you. Uh… and Candy best of luck in your process.
