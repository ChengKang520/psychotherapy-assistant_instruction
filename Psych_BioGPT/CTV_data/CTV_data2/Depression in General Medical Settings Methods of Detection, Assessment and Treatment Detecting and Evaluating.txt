00:00:00
GRAEME MCGRATH  Most patients with depressive illnesses are treated by their general practitioners or by hospital physicians. How can patients with depressive illnesses be recognized in general medical settings, and how should they best be treated? These questions are dealt with in two video tapes. In this first video tape, we'll show how to detect and evaluate depressive illnesses. And in the second, we'll deal with approaches to treatment. There are many symptoms which may indicate the presence of a depressive illness. And it is rare for patients to present with all of them at once. Let's look first at how some of these symptoms may present. 

00:01:10
Poor appetite 

00:01:10
 And your appetite, what's that like? 

00:01:15
 Well, I've lost my appetite a little bit that's why I'm not... (crosstalk) 

00:01:15
 Hmm. 

00:01:15
 ...eating as much as I want. I don't, I'm not, I don't feel as hungry as I... (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:01:20
 ...have been. 

00:01:20
Sleep 

00:01:20
 I feel exhausted when I go to bed, when I wake up, it's like the moment, my head hits the pillow it's like a zing, you know, I'm just awake. 

00:01:25
Tiredness 

00:01:25
 Yeah. 

00:01:25
  I mean, I sort of waken up a little bit, you know, as the day goes on. 

00:01:30
 Hmm. 

00:01:30
 But I'm just exhausted all the... (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
 Hmm. 

00:01:35
 ...time and it's like a physical effort to, ah, drive myself through the day. 

00:01:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:01:35
Worry about illness 

00:01:35
  I read silly women's mags about, you know, I don't know what these diseases or, you know, predominance of cancer in women about(ph) for a certain age or whatever and I found myself reading... (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
 Hmm. 

00:01:50
 ...stuff like that. And, ah, I guess it's sort of crossed my mind. 

00:01:55
Anxiety 

00:01:55
 I feel more worried. I mean, I didn't use to worry, (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:01:55
 you know, I mean, I'm not so to the worrying sort of person but I've definitely found myself getting more worried about the things that I don't generally worry about, (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:05
 you know. 

00:02:05
Depressed mood 

00:02:05
  I'm trying to fight it off but I must admit that, uhm, when I've got sober moments to reflect it is easy to slip into depression, (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
 you know. 

00:02:20
Poor concentration 

00:02:20
 You know, when it comes or constantly circulated with tons of informations, statistics... (crosstalk) 

00:02:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
 ...and so on, I find that it's, I can read it several times and when I normally I could recall it. I, I've not made the sense of it. 

00:02:35
Loss of interest 

00:02:35
 What about... (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
  your various hobbies and the things, are you still interested in those or? (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
 Well, I used to be quite fo, fond of going bowling... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:02:45
 ...but, uhm, about the station I'm very (inaudible ) are going down, I'd rather just sit at home and do nothing. 

00:02:50
Early morning waking 

00:02:50
  And I'm also waking up early in the morning, much earlier than I have used to, I mean, I, I would just sleep perfectly well but I wake up now about six o'clockish(ph), short of breath. 

00:03:05
Diurnal variation in mood 

00:03:05
 You know, I just wanna give up but then I get(ph) up and I'm not, you know, I got to work and I, to see the children and come home look after Oliver and it sort of eases a bit but I'm still exhausted. 

00:03:15
Feeling life is not worth living 

00:03:15
 In some mornings I'll wake up and I lie there and I just don't wanna get up, you know, I put covers over my head and I wish I was dead. 

00:03:25
Worthlessness 

00:03:25
 I don't feel wo, you know, worthwhile, (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
 you know. I don't know really how to say it but I just feel like... (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
  not so much that no one would miss me if I was gone, but maybe I'll be better off if I wasn't here. (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
 Hmm. 

00:03:40
Guilt and self-blame 

00:03:40
 Recently, I, I really start to feel that, that I'm, ah, like depriving Oliver, you know, sort of being a single parent, you know that somehow I'm depriving him of having a normal childhood, you know. 

00:03:55
Suicidal ideas 

00:03:55
 The other day, I found myself in the bathroom and I just felt so bad, you know, I'm, I actually, ah, got a glass of water and got the sleeping tablets and counted them out and, I mean, I actually got as far as putting one in my mouth and just thought I'm just gonna kill myself. 

00:04:10
GRAEME MCGRATH The list of symptoms of depressive illness is extensive. What procedure should be followed to detect depression in a medical consultation? 

00:04:15
Symptoms of depression First group Poor appetite Sleep disturbance Tiredness Worry about illness Anxiety Depressed mood 

00:04:15
GRAEME MCGRATH  If these symptoms are divided into three groups, then they can be pursued in order of the increasing severity. 

00:04:25
Symptoms of depression Second group Poor concentration Loss of interest Early morning waking Diurnal variation in mood Feeling life is not worth living Symptoms of depression Third group Worthlessness Guilt and self-blame Suicidal ideas 

00:04:25
GRAEME MCGRATH  The six first level symptoms should be systematically explored in all patients. These include disorders of appetite and sleep, tiredness, worries about bodily health or function and low mood. There is nothing random about the selection of these symptoms for investigation of the first stage. 

00:05:00
Discussion point 1 

00:05:00
GRAEME MCGRATH What do you believe can be gained from exploring these symptoms first in your own practice? Perhaps, you'd like to stop the tape at this point and discuss this. 

00:05:10
Symptoms of depression First group Poor appetite Sleep disturbance Tiredness Worry about illness Anxiety Depressed mood 

00:05:10
GRAEME MCGRATH  These first stage symptoms have been selected for two reasons. In the first place, they can be explored relatively easily in a non-psychiatric consultation without obviously indicating a mental disorder. They should all be routinely inquired about in gen, in a general medical history. Second, these symptoms are amongst the most common founded depression. So if none of them is present, depressive illness can effectively be ruled out. Second and third level symptoms need only be investigated if there is evidence of depression. The first patient we are going to see has consulted about dyspnea. 

00:05:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
 So, you don't just written in(ph) to me saying that you're a bit on the breathless side, can you just... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
 ...expand on that a little... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
 ...bit for me. 

00:05:55
  Well, it's, ah, it's been going on for a few weeks really, I noticed it but the last couple of weeks it's, I got notice of them much, much worse. And, ah, I just find that every, that everything I do, I'm more and more breathless, uhm, and I find it harder to do things and likely(ph) to stop and sit down, and, you know, have a rest because I'm, I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
 ...just losing my breath... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
  Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
 ...all the time. 

00:06:25
 Uh hmm. Do you wheeze at all (inaudible )? 

00:06:28
 No, no, (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
 not particularly, (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
 it is just sort of difficulty in... (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
 ...getting the breath at all, it isn't a wheeze(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
 ...I don't feel tight, (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
 you know, wheezing... (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
 ...at all. (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
 And your ankles swollen? 

00:06:40
 Uhm, I have noticed that they have been over the last few weeks, yes, I didn't, ah, I haven't particularly take much notice of it 'coz it's being warm but yes, it have been a little bit swollen. (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Your appetite, what's that like? 

00:06:50
 Well, I've lost my appetite a little bit as well. (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
 Hmm. 

00:06:55
 I'm not eating as much as I wanted though, I'm not, I don't feel as hungry as I have... (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
 ...been. (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
  Uh hmm. Do you sleep okay? 

00:07:00
 Uhm, well, ah, there again, I, I go to sleep all right, I'm fine, when I first go to sleep but I find that I'm waking up in the night. Uhm, know, you know, trying to get my breath, feeling, you know, I, I need to get some air. (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
  And I'm also waking up early in the morning, much earlier than I've been used to, I mean, I, I would just sleep perfectly well but I wake up now about six o'clockish(ph), short of breath. And, ah, I very often get up then because it, ah, it doesn't seem to help just lying in bed... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
 ...relaxing, I'm better up really. 

00:07:40
 Hmm. Have you had to result to sleeping pills? 

00:07:40
 Well, I haven't done and I, I wondered what the GP might, (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
 ah, prescribe some but he, he hasn't done and I... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
 ...haven't taken them maybe because I'm not got any to take. 

00:07:50
 Uh hmm. Do you feel weary and lethargic at all, have you witnessed that symptom 

00:07:55
 Well, I don't, I, I feel, uhm, I just feel physically tired because I, I have to keep stopping as I say, when I'm doing anything I can't do it for very long without having to sit down, have a rest. Uhm, so, to that extent, I'm, uhm, but I, I feel it's inside me, I want to do all the things I normally do and I, I've, there's nothing wrong with me apart from this breathing... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
 ...there's a lack of, being... (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
 ...able to get my breath. 

00:08:25
 Uh hmm. And what about your moods, what would you say about your mood, how was that been? 

00:08:30
 Well, I'm all right, really, I mean, I'm a bit concerned about this because I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
 ...usually very active person and, uhm, you know, I got and that sort of thing and I haven't been able to do that for... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
 ...the last couple of weeks at all because bending down and so, (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
 and it's really, you know, worn out, and, ah, some I'm bit worried about that but I'm all right otherwise. 

00:08:50
 Uh hmm. Do you have any serious illnesses in the past, did you have a rheumatic fever, TB, (crosstalk) 

00:08:55
 Uhm. 

00:08:55
 anything like that? 

00:08:55
 Yes, well, I did have a rheumatic fever and allergy and but I thought that's had completely cleared up. (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
 I haven't anymore symptoms... (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
 ...since I was child. 

00:09:00
 And any operations? 

00:09:00
  Uhm, well, you know, the usual things, I have my appendix out, I have my tonsils out... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
 ...but nothing other than... (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
 ...that. 

00:09:10
GRAEME MCGRATH In this first part of the interview, the patient mentioned loss of appetite and sleep disturbance but did not complain of tiredness except on exertion, nor were she excessively worried about her health. These symptoms could be connected with a vague non-specific state of depression but could be equally be secondary to physical illness. In this case there was no evidence of an abnormal degree of anxiety or depression. So the doctor decided to stop at this point and pursue a somatic course for the first level symptoms. Let's look at another example. This patient is 51 and a senior sales executive. He has suffered from some years from chronic leukemia, and has presented complaining about a general deterioration in his condition. 

00:09:55
 So, from the point of view of your blood problem, how things been, have you had any breathlessness, palpitations anything like that? 

00:10:00
  Well, it seems to be fairly static but, (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
  uhm, the effort to do things seems to be greater, (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
 ...you know, uhm. 

00:10:15
 Do you get palpitations at all? 

00:10:15
  Ah, not really, but I do feel constantly, uhm, fatigue. 

00:10:25
 And your appetite is, is that all right? 

00:10:25
  My appetite is good, you know, ah, I mean, I could do with losing some weights... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
 ...but I don't feel seem to get the benefit and the energy from eating those nutritious food, but, ah, I can still feel tired or unsatisfied, ah, in social eating, I don't bother with now, (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
 you know, where we used to go for business lunches and things. I, I usually check a rain check on it, you know. 

00:10:55
 Do you sleep okay? 

00:10:55
  That is puzzling. I sleep very well, and I wake up in the morning and the sun shining and I think it's a lovely day for about two minutes. And then my minds comes back to the trouble ever since I've gotten within an hour or so of getting up I can sit down and I could nod off in the chair if I wasn't doing anything, you know. 

00:11:30
 And when you aren't doing things, do you still feel weary or lethargic? 

00:11:35
 If I don't keep active I can feel, if there's a break, I can feel tired at anytime. Uhm, (coughs) like I settle down to watch TV, ah, you know, something I really want to watch and if I'm in a comfortable chair halfway through I'm asleep. 

00:11:55
 Have you got any worries at the moment at all, anything bothering you? 

00:11:55
  Well, I've good reason to worry, I don't know if you're familiar but ah, my wife has been in hospital for sometime now. 

00:12:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
 Uhm. 

00:12:05
  Have they sorted out what's wrong with her? 

00:12:10
 Ah, I'm not familiar with the medical term, ah, some sort of chorea. (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
  I don't know if she will come out and we were happy, ah, as ah, a couple and, ah, I definitely do miss her, (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
  and, and ah, I mean, apart from, ah, ah, not being there, the, ah, the fact that she might not get, ah, get better is, it takes my mind off my own problem, (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:50
 ah, but it's more frustrating with somebody else because you can't regulate... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
 ...what's happening. 

00:12:55
 Right. And that must be a major problem, perhaps we could come back to that, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:13:00
 a little while. Okay(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
  I would like to know more about her disease. (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
 Yes. Now, would you say you get on unduly anxious about the things at all? 

00:13:10
 Not more than usual, uhm, there's no, you know, there's no reason why I should be. (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
  Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
 Ah, and I don't feel that I am, (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
 Uhm. 

00:13:20
  What about your spirits, ah, are you low or do you feel depressed at all? 

00:13:25
 I'm trying to fight it off but I must admit that, uhm, when I've got sober moments to reflect, it is easy to slip into depression, (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
 you know. And I don't want this to happen but it is a fact that I'm, I'm realizing that it, it, it is becoming a free check, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
  Right. 

00:13:55
GRAEME MCGRATH In this first part of the interview, the patient's appetite and sleep have found to be only mildly affected but he is tired and lacking energy. Questioning him about worries uncovered his worry about his wife's illness and the doctor quite properly suggested that this should be talked about in more detail later. The patient has not been unduly anxious but is clearly in low spirits. These symptoms indicate a mood disturbance that could benefit from further attention from the doctor and they could indicate a severe depression. The doctor decides to investigate further. 

00:14:25
 Uh hmm. What about concentration, do you find you can concentrate in, on things as well as you used to? 

00:14:35
 I must confess I do find it really difficult to concentrate. Ah, and, as essential I do concentrate to produce, accula, accurate reports, uhm, sales forecasts and results on a regular basis, you know. And, ah, I've got to be very careful to do it in a, a logical manner, otherwise I get confused. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
  Uhm, that's not the, the normal situation I would find myself in, you know. 

00:15:10
 Uh hmm. What about your interest in things, ah, you must have some sort of hobbies and things, do you still pursue those or? 

00:15:15
  Not really, I've attended to a lot of things, I, I don't go to the club anymore and, ah, with my wife especially, ah, not being on the scene, I tend to avoid the social occasion and the sport and occasions, you know, we used to go to the tennis club and it doesn't seem the same on my own. Uhm, I don't really find the company stimulating, you know, because it doesn't remove the problems that I've got. 

00:15:45
 Uh hmm. With this feeling of lowness or whatever you want to call it, do you find it varies during the course of the day at all or was it solidly there all the time? 

00:15:55
 I can go in bursts(ph) and I feel my normal self for a while. And then, just suddenly, I feel tired... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
 ...for no apparent reason, you know. 

00:16:05
 Uh hmm. Have you ever felt that life isn't worth living at all? 

00:16:05
  Ah, no, I've, you know, I've got good re, I've got everything to live for, (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
 ...and I have a lot of responsibility and loyalty to my wife, (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
 Hmm. 

00:16:20
 you know, and she's been a very good wife to me. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
 Ah, so it hasn't occurred to me to any at all. 

00:16:30
  You've never thought of suicide then? 

00:16:35
 I'm looking for solutions doctor... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
 ...not, ah, the easy way out, you know. 

00:16:40
 Uh hmm. Well, I think the next thing we must do is just examine you briefly and just make sure everything's just as usual and take some blood tests and, ah, and we'll talk some more. 

00:16:50
  Fine. 

00:16:55
GRAEME MCGRATH This patient is depressed. As well as the tiredness and mood disturbance already noted, more specific questions revealed his mood varies during the day, being worst in the morning. His concentration is poor and he has lost interest in his normal pursuits. However, he has not felt hopeless nor that life is not worth living. Family problems may have played a part in causing this depression. Is it necessary to take the investigation further in this case and explore third level symptoms? In general, when should you go onto the third stage of the interview? 

00:17:30
Discussion point 2 

00:17:30
GRAEME MCGRATH Stop the tape now and discuss this. 

00:17:30
Symptoms of depression Third group Worthlessness Guilt and self-blame Suicidal ideas 

00:17:30
GRAEME MCGRATH  Third level symptoms are in general only seen in severe episodes of depression. Although, these are relatively rare in general practice in medical wards, they should still be investigated in certain patients. 

00:17:50
Symptoms of depression Second group Poor concentration Loss of interest Early morning waking Diurnal variation in mood 

00:17:50
GRAEME MCGRATH A good practical rule is to take the presence of thoughts of dying or of life not being worth living as an indication to proceed to the next stage. 

00:18:00
Symptoms of depression Third group Worthlessness Guilt and self-blame Suicidal ideas 

00:18:00
GRAEME MCGRATH If there is no evidence of the patient wishing to die, then it is you usually possible to omit the third stage questions. This patient's symptoms are significant but still do not reach a severity sufficient to justify considering referral to a psychiatrist. Such severe illness is a characterized by the presence of third level symptoms. 

00:18:20
GRAEME MCGRATH Let see another example. This patient is 37, a single parent and a teacher. She is consulted about abdominal pain and repeated nausea. She has already talked about poor appetite, poor sleep, loss of energy and interest. She has been anxious and unhappy. Let's join the interview while the doctor is asking the second stage questions. 

00:18:40
  Right, so I've got a letter from your doctor saying you got trouble with your bowels. Can you tell me about that? 

00:18:50
 It is this pain I get sometimes, I mean, it used to be sort of over this side and it move, seems to be there, seems sort of a, bit low down. It's like a gripping pain. (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
 I mean, I don't get it all the time but it started to happen a bit more often and sometimes after I've eaten, then it gets worse and my stomach gets really... (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
 Hmm. 

00:19:10
 ...big seems it would bloat out a bit... (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
 ...and, ah, it's very uncomfortable. It's like, (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
  Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
 like that, sort of like a annoying(ph), (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
 you know, sort of, but I can't describe it really, it's just seem like... 

00:19:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
 ...annoying pain. 

00:19:20
 And your bowel habit, is that actually okay? 

00:19:20
 No, it's gone a bit worse. Uhm, I mean, if anything I used to be slightly constipated and I find, I go to the toilet about three or four times a day... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
 ...and it's really, it's diarrhea and it's not normal. (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
 It's definitely diarrhea and... (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
 ...it's really sloppy. 

00:19:35
  And now are you taking a new tablets, it's enough to get you any new tablets, so far? 

00:19:40
 But I try at something, uhm, I think, I don't know what was written, (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
 I think it's some sort of a muscle relaxant and then... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
 ... I said, it was tension that's something in the bowel... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
 Hmm. 

00:19:50
 ...and, ah, but that didn't really do... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
 Hmm. 

00:19:50
 ...anything and, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
 ah, it's just the same. 

00:19:55
 What about concentration, are you finding you have any problems with concentrating on things, on your work or day to day activities? 

00:20:00
  Yeah, Yeah. I am really 'coz ah, I mean I, I mean I work with, ah, young children so I have to really give them a lot of attention and I find, I just can't do it. You know I can't, you know they'll start telling me something and normally I let them run through it and even if it takes ages, that's when I stutter and I still haven't got the time for them anymore whereas I used to come home from work and maybe I sort of collapse in front of the TV, ah, now I'm sort of turning it on and I turn it off and I pick up a book and I'll put it down. Nothing holds my attention... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
 ...very much. You know that, even going out, I don't really go out very much... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
 ...anymore 'coz I, I sort of really want to but I get sort of, ah, oh! yes, I go out even I'm tired when it comes to getting ready or arranging babysitters like that I can't be bothered... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
  Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
 ...you know, I'm much rather just sort of sleep around at home. 

00:20:50
 Would you say you're still enjoying your work? 

00:20:55
  I think I am because I've always enjoyed it. But I'm not really, it's like my attitude changed towards it. I mean, I know the judge, the judge, the job itself is the same. But it's like my attitude has changed... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
 ...and, ah, no, I'm just tired, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
 it's, it drains me. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
 You know I'm feeling just more and more drained. 

00:21:15
 Hmm. Would you say your mood varies uhm, according to the time of day at the moment? 

00:21:20
  Yes, it does. I mean, I wake up in the morning and 'coz I haven't slept, I just feel so bad. I mean, sometimes I just lie there, you know I just put covers over my head, I just, just wish I was dead, you know. I just wish it was all over. You know that, I just didn't have to carry on. You know, just wanna give up. But I get up and, ah, you know, I go to work and I go see the children and come home look after Oliver and it sort of eases a bit. You know, I'm still exhausted but I don't feel quite as bad as I do in the morning and I mean, I just sort of just go up and down but I'm definitely really a lot worse in the morning. 

00:22:00
 Uh hmm. Have you ever felt that life isn't worth living? 

00:22:05
 Yeah, yes I have. Mainly in the morning, you know some mornings I wake up and I lie there and I just don't want to get up. You know, I put covers on my head and I just wish I was dead. 

00:22:20
 Have you ever thought about harming yourself in any way? 

00:22:25
 Yes. I mean I never used to, but I have recently. You know, several times actually. 

00:22:35
 And to what extent does, that those thoughts has been following you through? 

00:22:40
 Well, I've never do it before but I'd like to say, I mean, there was a time I've never ever thought about it before. But the other day, I found myself in the bathroom and it was so bad, you know, I actually, ah, got a glass of water and got the sleeping tablets and counted them out and I mean, I actually got as far as putting one in my mouth and just thought I'm just gonna kill myself, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
 I just, I'd had enough. I completely had enough. I mean, what if I didn't. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
 But, ah, I really wanted to do it. 

00:23:10
 How did you feel about yourself? 

00:23:15
 I didn't feel wo, you know worthwhile. (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
 You know I don't really know how to say it but I just feel like not so much that no one would miss me if I was gone but maybe I'd be better off if I wasn't here, (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
 Hmm. 

00:23:30
 you know, if, ah, like I said, I (inaudible ) could be brought up by someone else and they've got someone else for my job and you know, (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
 I just feel like disappearing sometimes. You know, visually. 

00:23:40
 Yeah. Do you ever feel guilty about anything? 

00:23:45
 Well recently I really start to feel that, that I'm, ah, like depriving Oliver, you know, sort of being a single parent, you know. Somehow I'm depriving him of having a normal childhood, you know, that he should have sort of a mom and a dad and be brought up in a, you know, happy environment and here he is being brought by someone who has to got to work all the time you know, he gets dumped with different babysitters and, ah, I just feel like I'm depriving him. 

00:24:20
GRAEME MCGRATH The interview with this patient gives clear evidence of a severe depressive illness. This is confirmed by the formulation of a suicide plan and by intense feelings of worthlessness and guilt. An important issue raised in this part of the interview was the risk of suicide. It is essential that the doctor does not avoid this issue. Apart from the risk, patients who have had suicidal thoughts are often distressed by them and welcomed the opportunity to talk about them. 

00:24:45
GRAEME MCGRATH  These examples show that it is possible to detect and evaluate depression in medical settings by using a staged interview technique with clear rules for bringing the interview to an end or moving onto the next stage. Now, familiarize yourself with these rules by reading the booklet that accompanies this tape and then move on to the next tape. 

00:25:10

00:25:10
GRAEME MCGRATH  This videotape is the second of two discussing the detection and treatment of depressive illnesses as they occur in medical settings. If you haven't already seen the first tape, we suggest you do so before watching this one. Many patients present to their general practitioners or to hospital doctors with symptoms of depression. Very often these are felt to be understandable in terms of the stress of physical illness. This may be true but does not imply that depression should not be treated when it arises in these settings. Depression can exacerbate the symptoms of physical illness and make them more difficult for the patients to cope with. An untreated depression can become chronic. For this reasons, it is important that depression is treated effectively. Offering treatment may be the person, patient's first indication that he has a depressive illness and so it is important that the interview sets the stage for effective treatment. There are three stages to this approach. 

00:30:15
GRAEME MCGRATH The doctor must be able to indicate clearly what he thinks is wrong with the patient. This involves fitting the symptoms to a different kind of etiological model from that held by the patient. We call this reframing the diagnosis. Next, he must listen carefully and emphatically, pick up emotional cues and allow the patient to express his feelings while being supportive. This in itself plays an important part in relieving the depression Finally, he must offer appropriate physical treatment that is clearly explained to the patient. This three-part approach will give better compliance and ultimately better treatment. Reframing the diagnosis is the important first stage. The patient may resist the notion that he has a psychiatric illness. Let's see an example of this. 

00:31:05
 Right. Well, we've got a few problems that we need to sort out here and you've got your own disease, you've got your leukemia which seems to be okay. It's in remission and everything seems to be coming along right there. 

00:31:20
 I feel like I'm controlling that, you know. 

00:31:20
 Right. And you've got your wife in the hospital... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
 Yeah. 

00:31:25
 ...ah, and with a prospect of probable deterioration as time goes by and I think those two things would get the best of us down and one can't help feeling, particularly from your response to what we've been talking about today, that there is a little bit of an element of you know (inaudible )...(crosstalk) 

00:31:46
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:46
 ...and I might even say that you're a bit depressed. How do you respond to that? 

00:31:50
 Well, I must admit that I'm irritable and short-tempered. And that's not work pressure, you know, uhm, I would hate them to know at work that I was depressed, ah, because I've got to be, seem to be in charge, ah. 

00:32:15
 Do you accept that you are depressed? 

00:32:15
 Well, what level of depression are we talking about? 

00:32:20
 Well, uhm, some people get their spirits just a bit down and then that everybody has moments of depression but I think it is when it becomes sustained and when it exhibit symptoms... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
 Hmm. 

00:32:35
 ...like poor concentration and, ah, things like that that you've been talking about that, ah, it, it suggest that it might be a little bit worse than just the normal depression that we all get from day to day. 

00:32:45
  I think it's hanging over me as my wife's illness and... (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
 ...I think that is just tipping the scales... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
 ...where I would normally... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
 ...cope. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
  And I find it difficult to reconcile myself to that situation, (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
  you know, ah. 

00:33:05
 I think the point about trying to coax you into accepting that you might be a little bit depressed is that there are medications that one can try and that these can help your symptoms and break the vicious circle of worrying about things and getting more depressed about things, and we can do that in this clinic. I don't have to send you to psychiatrist. Another important point is to stress to you that when one has a label of depression, you're not being marked as a loony or you're not being sent to be mad.(crosstalk) 

00:33:35
  Which I certainly hope not. 

00:33:40
 And that's, that's important to grasp. And of course, one doesn't even have to mention those sorts of problems at work. You don't have to say you're depressed, all you have to do is say you're receiving treatment in the clinic. I mean, we can handle this perfectly well in a medical clinic. We don't have to send you off to the psychiatrist. 

00:33:55
 In complete confidence? 

00:33:55
 Absolutely of. (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
  That's essential. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
 Yeah, absolutely. And so, what I would suggest we do is prescribe an anti-depressant for a few weeks, review you again and just see how you're getting along. And I think you may be quite agreeably surprised that your mood does lift a bit. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
 Hmm. 

00:34:15
 It will enable you to cope with other things. And then quite often when people had a course of anti-depressants, they realize that they were a bit on the depressed... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
 Hmm. 

00:34:20
 ...side. 

00:34:20
GRAEME MCGRATH  This patient was aware of his depression but was unwilling to accept the psychiatric diagnosis because of the stigma attached. He was more willing to accept effective treatment when the problem is tackled openly by the doctor. Other patients resist more strongly the id, idea of a psychiatric course for their symptoms. And here is the first important problem for the doctor. Using what you have already seen, how would you go about explaining depression to a patient in a way that will enable him both to understand and accept it? 

00:34:55
Discussion point 1: Explaining Depression 

00:34:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Perhaps you'd like to stop the tape here and talk about this before going further. 

00:34:55
Reframing the diagnosis 

00:34:55
GRAEME MCGRATH  The first important task is to find out what the patient thinks about his mood disturbance. Only then can you begin to reframe the diagnosis, Firstly by explaining your own view of the symptoms, and then by establishing links between what you have observed, and what the patient experiences. The explanation must be clearly linked to the patient's symptoms. Let's see an example of the doctor reframing the patient's view of his illness and then going on to offer treatment for depression. Mr. Frasier(ph) has a history of peptic ulceration, treated conservatively in the past. This admission was prompted by a worsening of the pain, but gastroscopy has revealed only minor esophageal and gastric inflammation. 

00:35:50
Poor concentration Loss of interest Early morning waking Diurnal variation in mood Feeling life is not worth living. 

00:35:50
GRAEME MCGRATH The patient has symptoms of depression at the second stage but no feelings of hopelessness or suicidal thoughts. There are also problems at home. 

00:36:00
 Well, we've got the results of the gastroscopy... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
 ...and I'm pleased to report that you haven't got an ulcer. You've got this thing called duodenitis which is a mild inflammation of the duodenum. There is nothing more serious to it than that. 

00:36:15
 If it's what, mild then what's causing the pain? 

00:36:20
 Well, I think the duodenitis is probably contributing to the pain but I've been wondering whether it may be a little bit of stress playing a part. 

00:36:25
  But the way I, I see it, it's the stress that has to do with the illness. 

00:36:35
 Uh hmm. Well, when we were talking yesterday, you did tell me a few symptoms that are suggestive of depression. 

00:36:40
Pause Find out what the patient thinks 

00:36:40
  I suppose so but, ah, again I felt they were to do with, with the illness and the, the pain that I've been feeling about it. 

00:36:50
  Well, symptoms- 

00:36:55
Begin to reframe diagnosis 

00:36:55
 - such as lethargy, poor sleep, (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
  the loss of interest, poor concentration, they indicate to us that you might be a little bit depressed. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
 Depression comes in various guises. You can be mildly depressed or seriously depressed. And I'm not saying you're seriously depressed. 

00:37:15
Explain own view of the symptoms 

00:37:15
 But I'm just wondering whether you're depressed to a level whether, where you're more conscious of your symptoms coming from your stomach, and you're getting some pain but the pain is being made worse by the element of depression that you have. 

00:37:30
 I cannot see that really. 

00:37:30
 Uh hmm. Have you found anything makes your symptoms worse at all? 

00:37:35
 Well, as I said before, ah, work when I'm under stress certainly, at the end of term with the exams and extra duties, the pain is more, I notice more indigestion. And so, (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
 And this recent trouble, how long have you had that for? 

00:37:50
  About three months, thereabouts. 

00:37:55
 Uh hmm. And how long- 

00:38:00
Establish links 

00:38:00
 - have you had the trouble with your daughter that you were telling me about? 

00:38:00
  Hmm. I guess it's, ah, similar length of time really. 

00:38:05
  Do you think there may not be a link there? 

00:38:10
  It's possible. 

00:38:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
Relate to patient's symptoms 

00:38:15
 So what I'm suggesting is that you've got a bit more stress in your life... (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
 ...in the present time. Accept that you've got a duodenitis that's causing your pain. I'm suggesting that the stress is making that pain more difficult to cope with. 

00:38:30
 Yes, I, I can see that. 

00:38:35
GRAEME MCGRATH So the doctor has explained his own view of the cause of the pain in such a way that the patient can agree with him. In this case, the pain was linked to the patient's experience of dyspepsia associated with stress at work. Let's re-join the interview at this point and see how the doctor relates the depression to events in the patient's life. 

00:38:55
Transition statement 

00:38:55
 Well, I'd like to go in to how we're going to treat the problem for you, but just before we do that, can we just discuss for a few moments the problems you're having at home. 

00:39:05
 Well, I have spoken to the medical social worker who, who's been a, I suppose to talk about those things but I'll briefly, I mentioned earlier about my daughter and the sorts of problems we've been, ah, having with her. 

00:39:25
Allow the patient to talk 

00:39:25
 It's hard to talk about it but we're pretty certain that she's on drugs and, ah, I've found some cannabis in her bedroom. That doesn't worry me too much but, but it's just the crowd that she's with and I know that sort of things going on. She's getting more difficult and I just don't feel my wife on this and listen. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
 Have you talked to your wife about it? 

00:39:55
 I've tried to but we just, we never had this sort of problem before, you know, the family. It just seems so difficult to talk about it. 

00:40:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
Understanding Comment 

00:40:10
 So do you feel disappointed in the way your daughter is turning out? 

00:40:15
 It's hard not to, really, particularly she has not got a job. But, I don't know, somehow it's not all her fault. I just can't help the feeling that there's something weaved on it. My wife and I are at fault and she didn't recognize it coming and just didn't. I can't understand it with enough torture. I just don't know. 

00:40:45
 Did you feel- 

00:40:45
Picks up cue 

00:40:45
 - you've let her down as parents? 

00:40:45
  Yes, ah, it's hard to take. 

00:40:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
Transition statement 

00:40:50
 Well, I think we should talk about this a bit more at a later time. 

00:40:55
 Yes. That would be useful. It has been a relief. 

00:41:00
Supportive comment 

00:41:00
 Well, I think the other thing to remember is that, I think we agree now that you are a little bit depressed and depression... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
  will make all these problems seem much worse. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
 And I think that's the next thing we should get on to is deciding how we should treat this problem appropriately. 

00:41:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
GRAEME MCGRATH  So the patient has been able to start talking about his worries and some of his hurt and disappointment. At the beginning of this excerpt, the doctor explained that he would talk about treatment later, but at the moment, wanted to hear about the patient's feelings. You will have noticed that in this part of the interview, the patient did most of the talking. The doctor limited what he said to a few brief emphatic comments. He picked up the emotional cues but allowed the patient to express his feelings while acknowledging them in a supportive way. At the end of the excerpt, he returned to the business of treating depression. 

00:41:55
Discussion point 2 

00:41:55
GRAEME MCGRATH Now, how do you think the doctor should introduce the drug treatment he has in mind, a tri-cyclic anti-depressant, remembering that this is important to ensure the patient's cooperation? Perhaps you'd like to stop the tape at this point and discuss how you would go about it before watching the next part of the interview. To introduce the idea of anti-depressants you must begin by saying what they are for and what the beneficial effects will be. You must emphasize how important it is to take them correctly be and explain why. However, if you want the best compliance, you will also have to talk about possible adverse effects and warn the patient about these, so that they will be more acceptable. Let's see the doctor doing this. 

00:42:40
  I think we agree now that you are a little bit depressed and depression... (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
 ...will make all these problems seem much worse. 

00:42:50
 Uh hmm 

00:42:50
 And I think that's the next thing we should get on to is deciding how we should treat this problem appropriately. 

00:42:55
 What sort of treatment would that be? 

00:43:00
Introduce treatment 

00:43:00
 Well, I think we should give you a group of medications called the anti-depressants. Have you heard of these? 

00:43:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:05
Give positive effects first 

00:43:05
 There are a group of drugs that are specifically used for depression and have a very beneficial effect on these conditions. No doubt that they do work in a lot of patients. 

00:43:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
Explain treatment 

00:43:15
  One problem is that they do take a while to work. So, (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
 it's most important that the patient takes them regularly... (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:43:25
 ...in the time that it takes for them to work. And this can be up to two or three weeks. (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
 Uh-huh. 

00:43:30
  So you mustn't expect an immediate response. Sometimes, as you know, you take a pain killer and you immediately... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
 Yeah. 

00:43:40
 ...get a response. And so during that time, when you're not getting a response it's important to keep on taking them. One effect that they have is that they can be a little bit sedative, so that it is quite useful to take... (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
 ...these tablets at nights to begin with, and of course, you haven't been sleeping terribly well, so that might be an added bonus that you'll get from these. 

00:44:00
  Uh hmm. What about the drowsiness stuff, 'coz I, I'm having enough problem at the moment... (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
  concentrating during the day, would it make it work? 

00:44:10
 Well, it could make you a little bit drowsy during the day for a couple of days and it might be an idea not to drive if you find that you're getting drowsy. But most people find that after taking them for a few more days, the, the drowsiness wears off. 

00:44:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
Explain side-effects 

00:44:25
 There are a few other side-effects that... (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
 ...I hope to mention on this, that you can get blurring of vision. Another one is that you can get a slightly dry mouth. And another one is that when you stand up, you might just feel a little bit dizzy, ah, when you first stand up, and that's due to the blood pressure being a little bit low. And then mostly, some people experience a slightly sluggish bowel, having a little bit of constipation. (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:44:50
 These symptoms don't occur in everybody. And when they do occur, they're usually mild and as with the other symptoms or, or side-effects I have mentioned, they wear off after a few days. So I don't think they're going to be important, but then... (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
 Yeah. 

00:45:05
 ...useful to know about. 

00:45:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
  The last thing- 

00:45:10
Give details of treatment 

00:45:10
 - that we need to tell you is that the dose of the medication needs to be built up. Because of these side-effects, if we went on with the big dose to begin with, you might get a few more of them. (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
 So the thing to do is start on a low dose and then gradually build up the dose to what we call a therapeutic dose. 

00:45:25
 Yeah. How long do I have to keep on taking the tablets on that? They're not addictive, aren't they? 

00:45:30
 No, I think the first point is they're not addictive, we can say that categorically. And the second point is that- 

00:45:35
Explain duration of treatment 

00:45:35
 - you have to take these for a reasonable length of time, and I would suggest that we look for at least three months. We'll review the situation regularly and decide exactly how long to go on for, but I think you should think in terms of at least three months in the first... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
 ...instance. 

00:45:50
  But, but that's all about dealing with the depression and treating the depression? How's is it all gonna affect the pain? 

00:46:00
 Uh hmm. I don't think we can do abolish the pain completely. You've said over the years that you get your pain now and again under stressful situations. But I certainly- 

00:46:10
Express realistic optimism 

00:46:10
 - think it will take the edge off the pain and the pain will go back to being a mild indigestion with which you should be able to deal with the old antacid, et cetera. 

00:46:15
  Well, that's okay. I can cope with that. 

00:46:20
Invite questions 

00:46:20
 So, have you got any questions about anything we have discussed this afternoon? 

00:46:25
 Well, just going back to what we talked about earlier, I cannot see how this is gonna help what is happening at home for me. 

00:46:35
 Hmm. Well, I think the answer to that is we can't help the domestic problems directly, but what I'm hoping is that it will enable you to cope with things, get things in proportion a bit more and deal with it that way. 

00:46:45
 Yeah. I suppose my wife did say that I tend to get things out of proportion at times. 

00:46:50
 Uh hmm. So, what we plan- 

00:46:55
Ending statement 

00:46:55
 - to do is we'll keep an eye on your tummy. We're going to keep an eye on the way the depre, anti-depressant medication is working. And of course, we'll involve the social worker so they can keep an eye on the, your domestic situation. And with a bit of luck, within a few months, we'll have you, you a feeling a lot better. 

00:47:10
 I hope so, yes. 

00:47:10
GRAEME MCGRATH  The doctor has explained about side-effects. It's best to start antidepressants while the patient is still on the ward, as compliance will be much better if side-effects are experienced and dealt with at the start of treatment. The doctor then, went on to discuss the duration of treatment and how it should end. He allowed the patient to ask questions and then finished the interview with a definite statement about ending and the plans for the immediate future. So we've looked at some of the ways in which physicians can treat depressed patients in their own practice. When do you think it's appropriate to refer patients to a psychiatrist? 

00:47:50
Discussion point 3 

00:47:50
GRAEME MCGRATH Perhaps you'd like to stop the tape and discuss that before going on. 

00:47:55
[sil.] 

00:47:55
GRAEME MCGRATH  There are four reasons for referring a patient to specialist psychiatric services. First, if the patient is suffering from a severe mental illness that might require in-patient care. For example, depression with Level 3 symptoms, suicidal intent, or acute psychotic illnesses. Next, if the psychiatric diagnosis is unclear and a specialist opinion is required. Third, if the psychiatric illness has failed to improve with adequate treatment. And finally, if the patient needs specialized treatment such as ECT or psycho-therapy. 

00:48:30
GRAEME MCGRATH  It is commonly imagined that management of depressive disorders is a difficult and time-consuming process. However, these two tapes we've illustrated, the detection and treatment of depression can be done by non-psychiatrist physicians without taking up more time than they would usually spend with the patient. When treatment for depression has begun, it is important that the doctor who prescribes the tablets either sees the patient himself in the out-patient clinic or takes responsibility for ensuring that proper follow-up is arranged.
