MARSHA LINEHAN Hello, everybody, can you hear me? Can-- okay. People in the back can you hear me? If you can raise your hands. Okay. Good. If anybody has any trouble with sound which is I have been known to have people-- sorry to having trouble. Uhm, if you were the signal for trouble with sound is two hands up together. Okay, that means you're not asking a question you can't here. I'm gonna ask you, sine a number of you been talking flash bulb pictures and, ah, I'm going to ask not to it. The reason for asking not to do it is it completely destructs me. Okay, so when I work with my-- you know, I use to-- when I do skills training I do skills training with all this kind of teenage guys and they would start throwing popcorn across the table all the time I say, "Would you please stop it? Don't do that. It destructs me." And they said, "Marsha you are the most destructible person we've ever met." And I said, "It's true so stop doing it." So, if you all would do that I would not appreciate it. The slides are not on, now I have to look at them just to make sure I don't have anything that's publishable research that we haven't publish yet that I would need to take off but I'll try to get them up. If I don't get them up what I would do-- well I won't do so probably get them up but I mean I do have say the other strategy is, ah, simply to have everyone stand and I go to them and you take pictures cuz I know a lot of people do that. But we've got two-minute to do that and you'll have to stand on everybody's shoulders. So we're not gonna do it that way. So I'll try to get them up because a lot of, you know, they're sort of ordinary. So this is e-- nah! See I just see it. Please don't. Ple-- ple-- ye-- yeah, please don't take pictures it really does destruct me. Okay? It's, I, I go like this, okay. Could be something wrong with my brain, who knows? But whatever it is it undoes me. So, uhm, so this is real changes possible which is sort of my new name for all the stuff and the reason it's the name it's because it's true, real change is possible with the clients that we-- I were quit and I hope that you all do too. So this is an introduction more or less to DBT and, ah,-- so let me, ah, just ask first how many of actually are trained in DBT just that? Okay, not many. Okay. Be a problem if all you were. Okay. So, when I-- the thing you have to understand about this treatment is the art, I started the art in nine-- in 1970s I was the most about radical behaviors as you can find. I totally believe in behavior therapy I did-- I do now but I definitely did more of them than I do now and I figured that I would just care suicidal so my whole emphasis. Once I decide that I wasn't gonna go to medical school, ah, I decided that I would dissolve an effective treatment for suicidal people and so, ah, that's pretty much in the focus of my career as many of you know and, ah, so I figure that I ha-- I just got now of a post talk in behavior therapy and I believe in that I really to be honest with you never enter my mind this treatment won't gonna work. Okay, so I figured that we work and I would just show that it work and then I, I don't know what I was gonna do with my life but I was gonna do something once I found-- once I show that the treatment worked. So, this is the story of what happened when I tried behavior therapy. This behavior therapy of the '70s. So behavior therapy of the '70s, uhm, the treatment manuals of the '70s pretty much worse in the first 10 minutes to this and the next 20 minutes to this and the next 30 to this. But they actually-- more important than that were completely focused on change. Okay, you got a problem, I'll help you I just recently cuz I'm writing a memoir. And, ah, so I decided to go back and look at my very first scrip to do this, to do this research and I, I read it and I thought, "No wonder I had so much trouble with the patients because I said, the problem with the patients is they come in and they never think they're the problem. They think everybody else is the problem which is true of course but the problem was the next in it, she said. So therefore my treatment is gonna aim to get them to see that there is the problem. Okay, so you can see right away where the problem was in the treatment that I was doing, okay. So , anyway, in that way when I show them that they are the problem then I'll tell them how to change and then they'll be happy and won't wanna kill themselves and everything will be fine. Okay, so that was the, the basic idea, okay. So, what I want you to do as you listen to me go through all the traumas of developing, I wasn't-- I never win into this to develop a new treatment. I'm not really in favor of who decide to develop new treatments because generally if you already having evidence base treatment you shoul-- I figure out you should just do that. The problem was there was no treatment for suicide at the time and you are here when you hear much suicide talk we would not say we have improve very much over the last 30 years 40-- 40 yea-- so I figure out how many years but no way a lot. So, but-- and what I would like to do is just be thinking as you listen do you have clients like mine in anyway, A. B, do you run in to any of the troubles that I ran in too? Because the whole thing were simply consistent effort to solve the problems that I was trying to deal with the patients that I was to treat. That's the entire story of how this happen. And so, you'll understand the treatment as you see the solutions to the problems that I ran into. So that's basically the story. Okay. So, ah, I decided as I said that I want to treat patients at high risk for suicide. Now the reason I want them high risk was I was afraid that if I got a whole bunch of patients that were in high risk and I try to show behavior therapy worked that treatment as usual are no treatment or waiting they would all get better on their own. And then I wouldn't be able to show them my treatment was effective since everybody would get better and therefore one would not be better now I decided I should go for the very most serious the once that weren't we would think we get better on our own. So, I call now do I have to tell you to had some experience how it work for year in a crisis clinic. Okay. I do not have a degree in clinical psychology and all m y degree is experimental personality social psychology. Okay. So I have no clinical training except from my one year post talk in behavior therapy. So, I didn't quite know what I was doing when I decided to call all the hospitals in Seattle and I said, "Send me your worst." Person who's suicidal they had no problem with that. And that's exactly who they send, okay. So, uhm, so I was gonna do my behavior therapy. So the first thing that happened was I discovered that the people I was dealing with were extremely sensitive to any sort of rejection or invalidation and anything I said they would say, "What! You're saying as me? You're saying as menacing!" "No. No. I'm not saying this. I'm not saying as you." You know? And they were saying, "You're saying as me!" And so they would get not only get angry, they would hide behind the chair, they would storm out, they would tell me I was a jerk, they would quit therapy. And the whole thing wasn't going well. And so, I realized-- so I kept saying, "No, I'm not saying as you. No, saying as you." Then I say, "Of course everything exist is total and I wouldn't move over to it because I was, ah,-- my degree was for experimental personality. I was very, very familiar and I thought, eh, personality theory for years. So, I didn't know all of Roger's(ph) treatment, okay? Unconditional positive regards while switch from che-- behavior therapy change to unconditional positive report. Okay. So, I said, "Well of course I made this whole sense. Yes, absolutely totally die. You know, I could talk like this with the best dah-dah-dah-." And they would say, "What! You think I'm suffering enough, you're not gonna help me!" I say, "No. No. I-- of course I'm gonna help you. Absolutely I'm gonna help you." "Well, what help you change is way your saying is me!" I say, "No. No. I'm not saying that all. No I'm not. You know, absolutely I'm not saying that." So it was this entire experience so I couldn't win for losing basically and it was a lit-- I felt exactly as if, you know, if you think of Grand Canyon I wo-- I, I felt like I was on a tight rope going across Grand Canyon. And I was trying to keep this balance on the tight rope. And it was kinda like if I went too much that way I would fall to the bottom of the Canyon but if I went too much that way I'd also fall to the bottom of the Canyon. So I spent a long time basically on that trying to figure it out how to deal with acceptance and change and at that time although acceptance is in every therapy that exist today acceptance in there all and all of the behavioral interventions in particular it was not at any treatment that, okay? And I know that because I was afraid that if I said that I was adding acceptance to a treatment that the be-- the powers that be-- you know, the powerful behavioral therapy to say, "What are you talking about? We've already got there." So I sent my mail all around all these senior people in the field and said, "As you anything new here at all." And that's what they said. They said, "Yes, what's new? Was this radical focus are bringing acceptance in change together? And that was the solution, and why was it the solution? 

00:10:05
Immediate Problems to Solve 1. Extreme sensitivity to rejection and invalidation made a change focused treatment untenable. 2. Extreme suffering made an acceptance based approach also untenable. (aren't you going to help me?) New Therapist Strategies â¢ Synthesis of - Technology of Change and - Technology of ACCEPTANCE â¢ Spaciousness of Mind - To "dance" with movement, speed and flow â¢ Radical ACCEPTANCE of -Client - Slow and Episodic Rate of Progress Risk of Suicide â¢ Humility 

00:10:05
MARSHA LINEHAN I had a technology of change, so here's why would you think about with your own clients, okay? I had a technology of change, behavioral therapy is a very effective technology of change the problem was I had to have at technology of acceptance. That's what I realized as I was working with it. But the everything I needed at the same time was I needed what I think of spaciousness of mind. Spacious of my mind that I had to be able to dance with movements being flow because if I want, ah, acceptance that was a problem I had to be able to move over the change. If I went to change that be a problem I had to move over here. So I learn that what I had to be able to do is like dance, I had to be flexible, moveable and be able to go all over the play. And the sense trailing occasionally bleeding but not much. The other thing that become very clear to me this was very difficult for me was that I myself had to radically accept the clients as they were. Now, you know, right now I'm treating someone whose on no admit list if every hospital in Seattle. And I would say a large push of our people are no admits list. I think it's interesting that hospitals would say you're on no admit list cuz you're too serious for us but that's basically what happened. And so, uhm, I had to accept them but I also had to accept the slow rate of progress. Those of you have done behavioral therapy with something like panic disorder or something like social phobia where we have very effective short term treatments that work like that. You know, you do them you have 12 weeks and they're better. You know, I went from that kind of therapy to the kind of therapy where it seem like it took forever. I mean, it change was glacially slow. And so I-- that was very different and was very difficult because there's no one else in the field other than me at the time that I could talk to about why am I not good enough to make them go fast. But it became clear to me that they couldn't go faster.

00:12:10
MARSHA LINEHAN And finally, I had to deal with the fact that I had people a high risk for suicide so I had to deal with the reality that they could be dead before he saw him again. And, ah, and that requires acceptance, you know, acceptance of the fact that you have chosen or agreed to work with the person who would be dead. And, you know, if you get nothing else out of this whole talk except this the one thing you cannot do is make a person life. I don't care how hard you try you cannot control other people. It's been my single biggest mistakes when I think of-- when I made mistakes in therapy. This when I decided I was gonna control the patient. Not that I wouldn't do it if I could it just it doesn't work. And finally, I need a humility because it to get that we had this people kicked out of hospitals but nobody else wanted in town, everybody said terrible things about. They just were trying to kill themselves for attention being the favorite statement of the day and yet I had to have enough humility to see that a lot of what they said I did that was problem, was a problem. One of the agreements you have to make to be a devotee therapist actually is all therapist basically are jerks. Most of the things clients say that we do we in fact do and therefore we will not be defensive and we will work to understand what you have done it's mess therapy up and work on changing it. I other words this is the idea of recognizing that therapist are transactional event between two humans not between someone up here and someone down there but two people one here, one here. So, that's what I needed. 

00:13:50
Solution Was to Apply A Dialectical Approach Balancing Change Acceptance Strategies Dialectics 

00:13:55
MARSHA LINEHAN The approach was-- the, the idea was, was to bring together and, and integrate in one package exchange and acceptance and I'm gonna, ah, talk to you later about what those strategies are but essentially we had a lot of change strategies in behavior therapy. Behavior therapy has a lot of-- I mean the basics in all go over and again later but their behavioral assessment continue to see management, cognitive restructuring which is sort of essence cognitive therapy, uhm, ah, ah, exposure base interventions and s-- and teaching new behavior so those one of the basic, basics of behavior therapy. Anybody really knows those were almost can always read the book and do DBT. the main reason people have trouble with DBT really is that they don't behavior therapy, not that they don't know DBT. So that's the basics but then I had to develop a whole set of acceptance strategies also, and the acceptance strategies or the validation strategies primarily at levels for level one which is just paying attention not falling asleep, ah, looking like you're interested if nothing else. Reflecting back accurately you be made how many therapist reflect in accurately. I know this cuz I've watch those on tapes of therapist and I wanna scream and the clients do screams, say, "No! That's not what I would saying." And then the therapist keep insisting it is what they were saying. And, ah, so there's that and, and stability to read that which is not set ability to accurately read what's going with someone and then I telling you. There's the ability to understand and see. 

00:15:40
Solution Was to Apply A Dialectical Approach Balancing Change Acceptance Strategies Dialectics 

00:15:40
MARSHA LINEHAN There's the ability to understand and see that all behaviors cause no matter what it is, no matter how dysfunctional all behavior is understandable once you understand the cause of that behavior and then finally it's how to find the valid. How to find the inherently valid behavior. DBT requires that all therapist always look for, ah, this one instance of inherently valid behavior. Valid means if it's the facts, it's reasonable, it is normative and anybody else well adjust person would do that. So it's cal-- in DBT we call looking for the negative gold sometimes in the cup of sand but you find it. And if you look I guarantee you, you conduct. So, I had to do that-- so that was change and acceptance and that's where the world of the way the treatment got call dialectics was that, I was running a grant and I had to send my grant then and had to have a name for my therapy. So, I was gonna call it Cognitive Emotional Behavior Therapy, I thought I could that. And so that seem really long so it's kinda unhappy with that as name, I couldn't think of a name. But through beyond that I had a secretary working for me as an admin person and her husband-- it's a true story was a Marxism philosopher. So she knew that I was trying to find a name for the therapy, she said, "Well Marsha you train us dialectical." I said, "What's that?" So, I went and got the dictionary and I look to that and I started reading a little about it not that I understood it completely in the dictionary because it's, it's kind of, ah, ob-- kinda of, ah, not clearest idea but nonetheless it sounded good and I said, "Okay. Good I'm calling it back." So, I said, "Okay. We'll call it dialectical behavior therapy." And those of you've read my books honest know that it's called cognitive behavior therapy but that's because by publisher refuse to call it dialectical behavior therapy cuz he said nobody would buy the book. Okay. So, I went around trying to make that famous but I didn't succeed before the book came out. So, uhm, DBT, ah, ah, within and, ah,-- so I decided that I would-- the way I dealt with that was to made every single chapter start with the word dialectical behavior therapy. So that when you went some place and looked up, "Do I wanna buy that book?" And you saw all the chapters, it was in there. Okay. In other words they were right actually, the book wouldn't have been bought. Anyway, so that's where the name came from. And then, what happen next was I have all this fabulous graduate students who are all ahead everybody treating the patents trying to figure out what, you know, what to do. So, I told the graduate students, we ca-- I say, "Let's call philosophy department. I haven't seen somebody over and tells what dialect they really out." So, they said, "Okay. We'll do that." So, I, I call and got them then we come over and give us a lecture on dialect so we knew it was. And then, I told the students, I said, "Okay. We're now going to the book and we're gonna get rid of everything in this treatment that's not dialectical." So the, the graduate students and I together mostly with a lot of work from them. I went through sort to clean up the therapy so to speak. So that's how that all happened, so that's how acceptance got in to DBT.

00:19:05
MARSHA LINEHAN And, uhm, this here I don't know if you can re-- can you read this? I don't know if you can. I, ah, I now have a graduate student in my clinical psychology program happens to have PHD in computer science. So, she's told me not too long ago, "We had the right to pay from the treatment." She said, "Marsha you think just like a computer person you're very modular in your thinking." And, ah, an all computer programs are basically modular and modules have to do whatever they do. And then your higher article cuz you have to have, you know, somebody on top and bottom saying, "Who does what?" So this is put together by my graduate student but it's a good example of acceptance from change strategies so you see the modules which this, the, the central change strategy in DBT's problems solving. So, I'm gonna tell you what problem solving book to get which is written by then else, no. Oh, no! I'm 17 and words don't come to my mind. Okay. I'll get it for you problems solving books. And so, the central part of the change is problem solving books. And so, the central part of the change is problem solving what's your problem? How we gonna solve it? This your problem we're solve at this way. So that's not focus. And then you see that strategies. Now, the other strategies of change-- what the thing that happen was I realize that you had to have more than one way of talking to suicidal paper in particular because a lot of therapist use when I call therapies and I say, "Oh, oh are you feeling sad?" That kind of stuff, okay? Which you could probably figured out it's not my style but on the other hand I can very warming and you ha-- if you can't be warm believe me you can't work with patients. I work within probably you do too. So, that's all from the on the acceptance side we have, uhm, reciprocally which says the warm self disclosing type talk. But on the other side we have irreverence, irreverence is, ah, behavior that's off track and unexpected, okay? So I give an example, uhm, in minute. The reason irreverence works though and this is a reason that you might want to consider in your own therapy doing that is irreverence is unexpected communication and it turns out that unexpected information is coded much more deeply than expecting information. In other words if you want somebody to really get something you can do irreverence also irreverence can push a person off tracks so they're here you're trying to get them to make some change or do something different irreverence pushes them. So, some examples of irreverence are, a client comes in and I said, "Okay, I need you not to kill yourself while you're in therapy, okay. Now I gave, I gave my several irreverent approaches to this. So, I-- so many clients won't agree with that so you move it to something they will agree with. If nothing else who had agree not to kill yourself where I see you next time. And I pa-- I say you realize that therapy does not work with that people if you did I can't help you. In the client family does agree which one I say another irreverent and I say, "You know, why in the rule which you have agreed but to that. When you're rather be in the therapy where you could kill yourself if you wanted to." In which point the client say something like, "Ah, what? What did you say?" And I say it again, they'll say, "I, I never thought of that." I say, "Well--" then usually I add on, "You know, you hey-- listen, I want you to wait till therapy is over to kill yourself.

00:22:55
MARSHA LINEHAN And, uhm, I said "Maybe you better wait in the next few year cuz if it goes a bright afterward they look like my therapy didn't long." Okay, you can see the irreverence here, okay? It's going in where angels fear to tread. It's like, "cut it out this bull shit." You're not thinking I'm gonna agree. Now clients says they wanna kill themselves I usually ask them-- and, you know, you can try all these cuz my students use exactly my, my terms and it works as well for them. So I say to a client-- uhm, they say they gonna kill themselves, I said, so are, are you thinking that you would feel better to that? And they'll say, "No, I'm not gonna feel anything, I won't have any pain." Which when I use that I say, "You realized there's no evidence whatsoever that, that's true." And I'll say, "Well, I believe it." I say, "Well, you could believe it", I said, "Nothing get wrong obviously." I said, "But if you all wrong?" I mean what if it's worse? I said, "Let's look at the audient most intelligent people in the world, okay?" I said, historically, there's not one single religion that don't think you're better worse if you kill yourself. I said, the king of lakes which i know a lot about think you go to help is not good. I said-- but then, you know, that other said-- think, "Now that the reason I'd never kill myself is that some of those religions think that if you it you have to start all over in your life." I'm telling you right now would never wanna do that, that's enough reason to stay living right there you'd have to go through all the suffering you've been through. Okay, so the fact that you're laughing shows there's irreverent, okay, but your clients won't laugh. A group like this will help the clients run but they, they start taking you, you say it, you have to say it a very serious way. Cuz, of course it's true there is no evidence, I mean the facts are-- is true.

00:24:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So anyway, so that's that, that's the irreverence. And then we have the bottom consultation to patient. So, DBTs always had the focus that you're better off learning how to fish than having someone giving you a fish. Okay, that's the basic idea here. So what we do is rather than doing thing for clients we tech clients how to deal themselves. So for example most therapist believe that although you would never call their husband and wife or parents to talk about the client, you're perfectly happy to call psychiatrist or another metal health care person. So DBT says you earn adult, this is when it's not with the adolescence you're in adult and you can talk to the psychiatrist. And you may not have lethal drugs therefore we expect you to tell your psychiatrist now to get you down on lethal drugs or a I say I have pro-- teenager right now came in, I say, "You're on so many medications it is possible that you're actually part of your problems are these medications there isn't research on polypharmacy therefore we don't know the affect in this or this. I would like you to go see your psychiatrist and I would like you to talk to them about tapering you down and then starting over and saying what you need. So would you please do that? Yes, you will thank you." Instead of being calling them up and telling which I've always thought it's like treating clients like children like they were incapable in confident. When they our children I do, do it. So, that's-- in general DBT coaches patients, you need this, you need housing wa-- we might go with them and coach them. We've had case managers go and stand outside where they had to go do something and the person comes back out to get coaching goes back in. So, that's the, the fundamental idea of DBT is, is that, okay? We're going to coach you, it is I do have to tell you more work to coach them than do to do it yourself, ah, we all know that probably. And I think a lot of us do it because either just do it ourselves than it is to teach them.

00:27:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Now if you go to the other side over here though, we've got, uhm, ah, environmental intervention so another words there are times when you really do have intervene the environment. And some number one is just the humane thing to do and my client calls me and has flat tire can't come to therapy they're not for a way. They aren't-- they don't have a history in not taking care of their care it truly is an accident as unusual then I might-- I could easily just go pick them up and bring them back, okay? For the session and then get them back to the car do whatever was needed to help them get that done depending on their situation. so, that's sort of one that's the humane thing to do but the other is when, uhm, the gain by doing something is greater than the loss by not doing something. So this when you get a call, generally when the emergency calls me and my pe-- they'll say, "Dr. Linehan, your patient is here." I tend to say, "Okay, let me talk to the patient." And I get the patient and I say, "Okay, what have you done and what have you have? Okay, and how getting you out there. Okay, so let's work on how to get out." And if you telling them you're gonna kill yourself I guarantee you they won't let you out, they're high power and you're low power. It's-- let's discuss how you're talking but what do you think I would do if the client was unconscious? I wouldn't talk to the client, if they ask me what the taken I would tell them. Okay, I wouldn't say, "Okay, wait till the client wakes up." Didn't tell them. Okay, and they're certainly other times without a lessons in particular there's certainly times when you're gonna talk to parent. Now, that I'm doing adolescent high risk for suicide adolescence my whole new world now. Uhm, I love this kids and I actually love their parents although their parents are lucky to have it. And, uhm, so, so in fact there's certainly times when you're being intervene, ah, for example I'll always call if someone has a provider whose prescribing for them. I call them to tell them, I need to let you know that I will not call you when I think the patient is endanger, I'm assuming that, ah, my physician says, "If you are psychiatrist you're confident to, to treat the patient without me." So every psychiatrist thinks they can treat a patient without a psychologist. And-- or a social worker, ah, councilor whatever threat we all are. So in general, you know, on nurse I generally say, "My plan is not to call you so I need to mo-- you know, to, to watch when it was going on. But I would tried to get the patient call you." So that's that strategy, is work very well would never had any trouble with that everyone in se-- once they know you're a devotee therapist they know. So for example when the judges with our drug addicts wanted to know, they wanted us to tell them whether the clients had dirty ways or not and we say, "We don't do that. We don't give information about our clients." And so we said, "So, what we'll do is we-- we'll right something up for the client, we'll give them the, their UA u-- urinalysis we'll give them the information on the urinalysis, we'll put in the folder and the patient can it. They just said, "Okay, that's all right we'll take it from you." So, ah, they could have probably screwed it up but, ah, we've got all the judges on our side also. So, uhm, uhm, you know, so I wanna, you know, you maybe thinking, "Wait a minute you can't do that." But I will tell you this-- you know, as you, you'll find out later, you know, we have unbelievably good data." 

00:30:40
Immediate Problems to Solve 3. Low distress tolerance and frequent crises and high arousal made sustained work on change very difficult. 

00:30:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So next, the next thing that happen was that the clients have low distress tolerance that was very clear and they have frequent crisis, high arousal and it made sustained working on anything difficult. In other words no matter what you sort talking about in the session they were come in and say, "Well, I've got fired from my job." I said, "Okay, let's talk about that." Five minutes later, "Well, no we can't talk about that cuz my boyfriend now left me cuz I got fired from my job. I need to talk about that." I said, "Oh, okay, let's talk about that." We start working on that, "Well I can't do that because I've just got how they can have been feeling there? We should talk about that." I said, "Okay", and they say, "You know, I'm-- well, okay, I'm gonna kill myself." I said, "Let's talk about that." So another words you found that if you want, if you have a personal and multiple problems which are people do know in multiple problems about multiple disorders. You have to figure out the way for them to go one problem on a shelf while you work on another, you can now work on every single problem and there isn't a single underlying problem all the time that you can do it and specially in crisis. So, essentially even in a crisis you got to tolerate part of this crisis. So how to solve that problem? 

00:31:50
New Client Targets â¢ Radical ACCEPTANCE of: - One set of problems to work on another - The Past - The Present - Limitations on the Future 

00:31:50
MARSHA LINEHAN So, the solution there-- so what I needed was for the clients to get the radical acceptance to once had a promise to work on another. I also-- I have clients that have pass their sort of unimaginable to me. People started being pimped out at age two or three and we're pimped out to age 16. And their whole life was no parent taking care most of drug addict mother. Another one whose father a minister started having sex with her sex. Troubled with her and I've heard every AOTA of that. That was tragic and then she goes to her husband who says, "You need a new sweater let's put a can by the bin and when we get enough money and there you'll be able to get--" Okay, so you know what I'm talking about. So, there are this really tragic cases you can sent in the military those of you working with the aids who see this just tragic pass of many of these people. Clients have to accept it all of us have to accept our past. Mainly, cuz nothing you can do about it, you got to accept it. We all have to accept the present cuz another we can we can do about that. The present is over, you know, in a millisecond like less than a millisecond. You know, uhm, uhm, I mean it so fast that we don't even know how fast it goes but we, we can change the future but none of us can change the present. And all of us have to accept limitations on the future. All of us have some sort of limitation. So, I realized that my clients couldn't deal with this so I had to teach them. 

00:33:15
â¢ Distress Tolerance: - Ability to tolerate distress without impulsively or destructively reducing it â¢ Experience of: - Connection - Essential "goodness" 

00:33:20
MARSHA LINEHAN I need a distress tolerance and what, ah, many people see me talk about this stuff. The other thing I realized was I needed to get them to experience their connection, their essential goodness and their essential validity. Uhm, their connection-- you know, all of us are connected, we're all one, it's the delusion that we suffer, okay? That is the delusion all of have it, our brains are made so that we-- our brain sees thing separately. But the facts are many of us can see that and experience of being connected to the inverse, to other etcetera, many of our clients can't but I needed to dissolve that and get pe-- help them have it. The other is that-- now those of you know that I teach on a judgmentalness where there is no good and no bad a very upset that I'm using the word goodness here just to those of some of you entering that crowd. But what I mean my essential goodness is the opposite of I'm the bad person and I discover so many of the people I treat hate themselves. They think they're terrible, they feel ashamed, they feel awful about themselves. And I realized I had to deal with that. I mean, you know, you're, you're not gonna have lives with living that they experience worth living as without that. Now, let me just make an assignment. So when I say, "lives worth living", we know that every life i s worth living. So I'm not I don't wanna imply that I don't think that. So, eh-- that word really means lives experiences worth living but that sentence is too long. So, I'm gonna go back to lives worth living. Okay, essential validity means, I have the right I raise my hand I count, I'm one, I'm one of the group. I'm, I'm important too. I'm, I'm not in consequential. So that-- this was the whole idea here. 

00:34:55
New Client Targets â¢ Radical ACCEPTANCE of: - One set of problems to work on another - The Past - The Present - Limitations on the Future â¢ Distress Tolerance: - Ability to tolerate distress without impulsively or destructively reducing it â¢ Experience of: - Connection - Essential "googness" 

00:35:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Now, the thing that happen was when this happen at the time I was having a crisis of faith sort of. And I was teaching meditation, I been trained as spiritual Catholic, not Catholic Christian, spiritual director. So as a spiritual director, my Catholic pastor know this. And I was teaching meditation to the church and, and we would made every week and every week we would then share and everybody would share something and every we-- I shared the exact same thing for a year, "I'm bored." Okay, "I'm bored. I'm bored again. I'm bored." So I started thinking, "Hmm, something is wrong here." And I realized that what he-- what was going on was that I wouldn't accept that I wasn't gonna have some major spiritual experience. And I was clear to this idea that I should have that. So I real-- but I do know how really how to deal with that and I don't know what to do about it so I decided I need to learn acceptance. So what happen was-- and this is where mindfulness came in to DBT was I am-- I because I'd been in this crucial group I called them and I said, "Whose--" I figure out that's going on and I also find the best. So that I said, "Who's the best teacher in the world?" So they said, "Well, there's this woman in Shasta Abbey California, she's a Zen master." I had no idea what Zen was. Okay, and I never heard about it. But it is sound that, sound that, sound so scary I got to tell you. And the other option go to this Catholic priest in Germany. So I said to myself, I said, "Okay, am I a Catholic or I am a woman?" So I decided to go see the woman first. I decided to go see her for two months and go see the Catholic for one month, okay? Because I wouldn't sure which would be which. And within, you know, weeks of being Shasta Abbey in California I knew that I have found exactly what I was looking for not that I really understood much about what was going on but it was very Zen Buddhist. And, ah, we had teaching all the time 24/7 we were, ah, any time you fell out to your practice through someone around to tell you get falling out to your practice, "Marsha, the monks notice you're out of prac-- out of practice daily breakfast." I say, "Cuz they had such good food. And it was kinda came down the table and I would be looking to see what was coming." "Out to your practice, Marsha." So, I'm met nothing-- I'm nothing if not a good student. I mean I-- when I me-- when I'm a student I do-- I follow. I'm a good follower, I'm good-- probably okay leader but I'm a really good follower. So, after the LA I went to Germany to see the Catholic priest and I-- and, and that, ah,-- he ended up being my teacher-- so he's my teacher. Ah, I been a student of his for, ah, let's says 1984, '83 or something. And, uhm,-- so I-- when I was there I also saw the teacher everyday like you te-- tend to do it Zen. And, uhm,-- so I thought, "Okay, I have found exactly what this people did." So I decided we'll come home and teach it to them. Okay, so that would be difficult because I knew everything they did. "You need to meditate, look the wall close your eyes", stuff like that. So, I came home and that, that time I was trying to develop skills training. I thought these people need a skills from the change stuff so I was at the hospital and the hospital teaching people fall disorders had Schizophrenia, had everything in there. Okay, and I'm trying to figure out what to teach them so I decided that I teach them this. So I told them, I said, "Okay, everybody take off your shoes." Well, nobody would take off their shoes. But worse in that I couldn't remember why you should take off your shoes. So I said, "Okay, don't do that let's sit on the floor." They wouldn't do that and they told me that was embarrassing. "It's okay, I didn't know why you do that anyway." So I thought, "Fine, we'll sit in chairs." So then we sit in chairs and I said, "Okay, while we're sitting here I want you just breathe in, breathe out and watch your breath, okay?" This what they tell you to do. So the person in my right says, "I don't do breathing, Marsha." Now, when you're in a group, you know, you can't have one practice for one person and for another. And the next person said, "I breath, I die." I said, "Don't do that. Don't do that." But you know any of you have even been to Zen anything like that you do sitting for 25 minutes then you walk for five minutes staying in your practice of course and you sit and then you walk. So it's a little group, let's walk. Okay, now remember I'm at the middle house-- at the-- sort at the-- our patient section of the-- of that hospital and there's this long, ah, little hall. So I said, "Everybody up", and they all got up. I said, "Okay, this way." So know just pay attention when you're walking to your feet on the floor something like that. Okay, so I started walking, ah, they're behind me of course. I keep walking-- I get down the hall I turn around and there are two people. So, I thought, "Well, it's not working out." But I was certain in it what I have learned was what they need I didn't loss my faith on that. I thought, "Okay, what are they teaching yoga there? Are they teaching me to take off my shoes? No. Are they teaching me to sit on the floor? No. Are they teaching me to watch my breath? No. Are they teaching me to walk and pay attention to bottoms of my feet? No." So, what are they teaching? And they ask where the development of the DBT mine from the scales came from. I started going back to meet with my teacher who of course had to approve various thing so when you teach something there wasn't approved. And what I did is take, uhm, my really Zen practice and translated in to behavioral statements it's base-- be-- behavioral actions. That's basically what I did. And, uhm, then I started teaching those so the sense of the, ah, the practice is absolving of course what do you, you observe describing-- now a lot of people ask where that come from and it says, "I can only describe what you gonna observe which means you can never up size some-- describe some someone else thoughts, feelings, motives or event. But when you got see the teacher's sin that's what you do you describe your experience, that's what you do. Okay, so I got describing down and then participating storing yourself in becoming one because the whole project is really to become one. You already are one but it's to throw yourself in enough that you experience it. And then they're not judgmentally which is in every version there's in the moment present focus which in every version. And then, effectiveness as the skill came in primarily because sin has the stories about when people get enlighten you know this is incredibly high feeling that you don't wanna ever talk in. But you, you just wanna sort of fitting that experience and you don't wanna do anything concreted all and the story is that they're like sit on top of that flagpole. Okay, this is the sensory. So-- but, you know, also when you have to get off that flagpole go to grocery buy in the grocery, go home and cook some food. So that's being effective, so effective is giving up being right to be effective. So those are the-- so then I had to figure out what to call these skills cuz I couldn't call them sin. Because I had a lot Born Again Christian right-wing people going to south in my groups. So, sin would not work, I knew that. But I couldn't think of a name and so, uhm, it turned out it was a psychologist right at that time you've written a book in psychology on mindfulness and it was all about things the difference between automatically working in Xerox machine or doing it while you attended and what was the difference. So I saw the word "mindful" and I thought, "Oh, that sounds good. That psychological world and I won't sound like I'm one of these religious people." So I need that word and then I found a book by Thich Nhat Hanh and he'd just come out the miracle mindfulness. And I said, "Okay, I'm calling it "mindful", mindfulness I had no idea. You know, mindfulness was no worries all the time. And so just put that in and Alan Marlatt at the University of Washington, he and I were in the closet for years. We didn't want any behavioral therapies to find out that we were doing this. 

00:43:35
New Client Targets â¢ Radical ACCEPTANCE of: - One set of problems to work on another - The Past - The Present - Limitations on the Future â¢ Distress Tolerance: - Ability to tolerate distress without impulsively or destructively reducing it â¢ Experience of: - Connection - Essential "goodness" 

00:43:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So, we use to, we use to talking all that but we, we were trying to keep ourselves in the closet. Uhm, so that's how that happened and what the, the take home messages is, is particularly if you work in groups you have to have an approach that fits every single person in the room. You can't have an approach where you half of the people, "Well come on outside and when we're finish you can come back." And that was always my problem I was trying to figure out an approach that everyone could deal with, without violating anybody's values or core beliefs. 

00:44:10
Solution Was to Apply A Dialectical Approach Balancing Change Acceptance Strategies Dialectics 

00:44:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So, we need to change skills, we have a lot of those. We have interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation which, ah, we know even by self is extremely effective and we have, ah, distress tolerance which all the distress tolerance. We have a whole set now of addiction base skills for addicts, people addicted. And, ah, and then we have the acceptance goes in mindfulness. So we essentially now have half of the skills or acceptance and have our change which keeps the dialectic rolling. 

00:44:45
Modularity of DBT Skills Acceptance Skills Change Mindfulness Distress Tolerance Emotion Regulation Interpersonal Effectiveness Observe Describe Participate Non-judgmentally One Mindfully Effectively Figure 3. Modularity of Acceptance vs. Change Skills Figure 4. Modularity of DBT Skills 

00:44:45
MARSHA LINEHAN And that's it an example of how much or the treatment is. And what you're saying here is that-- it's a very modular treatment all the way through. 

00:44:50
Immediate Problems to Solve 4. Ever changing clinical presentation together with frequent crises resulted in confused therapists and a chaotic therapy 

00:44:55
MARSHA LINEHAN The next thing that happen was, uhm, that the, uhm, the clients came in with so many different problems so much at the time and they had serious, super serious things like they walk in with the gun or stuff that was much less serious and the problem was which are the therapist do drug of session. I mean it really became a problem. How do you run your sessions with such diversity in the people all of whom wanted to be dead for the most part. Or, ah, you know, that's where we started. 

00:45:25
Percent DSM Diagnoses: BPB Chronically Suicidal Patients Diagnosis Lifetime Current Major depression 96.7% 75.0% Dysthymic disorder N/A 14.3% Substance abuse 15.2% 5.4% Substance dependence 56.5% 26.1% PTSD 56.5% 51.1% Social phobia 21.7% 16.3% Panic disorder 52.2% 40.2% OCD 23.9% 19.8% 

00:45:25
MARSHA LINEHAN So this is just to show you, you know, people think I treated while I'm personality disorder. However, 75% of major depression. Fourteen percent dysthymic disorder. Twenty-six percent substance dependence. Fifty-one percent PTSD. Forty percent panic disorder and 23% eating disorders. So in other words we really treat across the board disorders. 

00:45:50
Adolescent DSM Diagnoses: Suicidal Patients Diagnosis Lifetime Greater than 3 disorders 60.6% Major depression 53.8% Alcohol abuse 43.2% Conduct disorder 42.6% Substance abuse 32.9% Simple phobia 30.8% Social phobia 28.8% PTSD 27.1% Solution Was to Apply A Dialectical Approach Balancing Change Acceptance Strategies Dialectics 

00:45:50
MARSHA LINEHAN And, ah,-- so when I had to figure out away to do was to had to have a target base agenda which said that the therapist target this pay attention to this. And a protocol base agenda which was the skills training. So skills training is pretty much you learn what we're teaching this week. And target base is we deal with what's happen between now and last session and what the, uhm, cause of factors are and you're wanted to kill yourself. Or, you know, in this sense you have a treatment plan but it's very tre-- but it's completely principle factors. 

00:46:25
DBT as Hierarchical Treatment Higher importance 1: Behavior Dyscontrol 2: Quiet Desperation 3: Problems in living 4: Incompleteness Lower Importance Figure 9: Stages of Treatment Life Threatening Behaviors Therapy Interfering Behaviors (Serious) Quality of Life Interfering Behaviors Skills Deficits Figure 10: Example of Modularity of Specific Targets Higher importance Lower importance 

00:46:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So, the stre-- the, the importance here is that first you start of behavioral dyscontrol, the steps are behavior dyscontrol. Behavior dyscontrol the main one is life threatening behaviors. Now, you might think that anybody would deal with life threatening behaviors first, I do too but you'll be amaze if that's not name by this treatment manual. We went to do another person's treatment manual which said nothing about what to do if someone suicidal so we decided we've follow the manual completely so we had to quit the treatment almost right away, because there was no way to do that manual without adding something to it. So, it's very interesting, and why is it that no one puts how to deal with severe disordered behavior and their manuals because those people are excluded from their treatment studies. Suicidal people are like pregnant women, you know, they're not pregnant women can't get any medical research and suicidal people can't get any behavioral or psychological research. And so, it turns out that it's not anybody else's manual hard way. So that was the big problem, so life threatening behavior. Then when DBT move into the prisons I realized we should add in murder that you would, you would want to pay attention that too, so we did. Then you can treat a person if they have severe therapy interfering behavior in others but they don't show up for sessions. They don't do anything they need to do. If they come in and hide behind the chair, if they spend their whole time yelling and screaming at you, ah, and if they refuse to do anything that appears necessary for them to do the change. So you-- therapy referring behavior particularly the behavior of not coming to therapy has to be dealt with. And, uhm, serious quality of life behavior so if someone is really puberty stick and for example has no money can't eat, can't-- you know, you're gonna deal with that, you can't ignore that. We can't decide it's not a metal health problem, uhm, and then skills deficit. So, the, the strategy or behavior dyscontrol quiet desperation-- behavioral dyscontrol I always think this loud desperation and then there's quite a desperation. That's generally repeat PTSD treatment comes in. Problems in living and incomplete so, this is tough if you decide you wanna learn the treatment, uhm, you could do but, but the main thing about is this that you have to have a hierarchy so you know where to pay attention too when you're doing therapy. And this is, uhm,-- DBT was relieve that first, I mean the second treatment that was modularized then on effect didn't tell you what to do step by step in terms of manualized evidenced base treatment. And the other was interpersonal therapy which is also has as very nice and it has-- the person can have this problem. This problem, this problem, this problem and you can have four choices of what to pay attention too. But at least it gave you what to pay attention and how to pay attention to it. And I use that as my model for the development of the modular components to DBT. 

00:49:30
The Immediate Problem to Solve 5. Treating individuals at chronic high risk is both scary and leads to burnout. Standard of care has no data that it is effective Competency reduces burnout BUT there was no evidence-based treatment to fall back on. 

00:49:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, my next problem was, ah, was my therapist and pertinently that treating individuals are chronic high risk scary, uhm, that standard of care I don't know if you know this there's no evidence what so ever for standard care. All the stuff that you can go-- you know, you can get sued and lose for. There's absolutely no evidence any of that stuffs effective. We'll talk about it more on my suicide talk which I hope you come too. I'll tell you who-- what where the data is and where is not. Uhm, and so you started feeling unconfident, and wa-- the more unconfident you feel the more burned out you start getting. So I realized that I had to develop in the intervention. 

00:50:15
Solution Was to Apply A Dialectical Approach Balancing Change Acceptance Strategies Dialectics 

00:50:20
MARSHA LINEHAN For suicide and I had to have one that wasn't-- didn't get rid of all standard of care. Mainly cuz I had therapist so I had to keep safe and protected more or less. So what we've develop and you may find this interesting is that DBT risk assessment and management protocol is now call the Linehan-- wait I developed it for DBT but it's effective across all the different treatments called-- now it's called the Linehan Risk assessment and management of protocol and we're developing an app so you can do it on your phone you, you can do it anywhere and it's the strategies for dealing with suicidal behavior but it also has a checklist with it. And the checklist is design to make you feel secure treating your suicidal person. So, it says, "Did you do this?" "Yes" Next question, "No? Why not?" And then it gives you all the good reasons for not doing it. So it was really trying to decide something so that therapist new the, the at the basic level what was he expected when a client wa-- and what to do in a client, ah, attempted or was suicidal. And-- so it has, you know, all how to do it. And-- so it was a very well put together strategy and this is the one thing, you know, have the most experience work is dealing with suicidal behaviors So, we're getting-- we're gonna be making that more public later. 

00:51:45
The Problem Further 5. Therapist emotion dysregulation led to excessive fear, anger and hostility resulting in attempts to control the patient, rejection and attack.......or excessive empathy leading to falling into the pool of despair with the client and abandoning therapy 

00:51:45
MARSHA LINEHAN The next problem was this-- that the therapist-- I don't know how many of you treated suicidal behavior but no matter who you've treated you will glad to really in pain if your therapist not working it's very easy it's start getting mad at the therapist-- I mean at the patient. So you started getting angry then they keep get hostile and then they start trying to contro-- you trying to clear yourself again, you know, I can't stand, you're driving me crazy and then you get hostile. You get burn down and you starting wind the query, your, your furies with them. So that's group one and then we have group two were just the opposite. You, you, you have so much empathy that you fall into the pool despair with client. So the thing about which one of this are you? I been both, you know, I've, I've-- if I ever entertain the idea that suicide was a good idea. If I ever allowed myself to even entertain that thought. You know, I would have agree with a lot of clients since that was a good idea. So, what I had to do to do the work I do is I had to just put a wall in my mind and say, "I will entertain that idea." And it something for me because I'm a complete believer in your right to suicide. You know, I believe that people have a right to suicide but in the work I do I kindled to have that influence anything or I'll agree with the patient. So, I just don't agree. 

00:53:05
DBT Model Suicidal Behavior = Problem Solving (for the client ) and A Problem (for the therapist) 

00:53:05
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you've got to remember suicidal behavior is problem solving for the client and some problem for the therapist. So it's also problem typically for their families particularly with dealing with adolescence. 

00:53:20
Solution Was to Provide A Dialectical Balance Client Therapist Team 

00:53:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So my sit-- my solution here was to develop treatment teams with the goal of treatment is their job is to work with the therapist to try to make the therapy to improve the therapist. Okay, so there's therapy for the therapist. And you can't really say you're doing DBT if you're not on a team of at least two people, that's the minimum, okay. And that goal there is help each other be stay in the treatment model. Now, for those of you have learn DBT, ah, I'll give you some new news on this. Ah, I started realizing, ah, that some people were started being afraid that they sim-- if they had a patient committed suicide and they talk to their colleagues that they-- and they got sued that they might be able to subpoena those notes. Okay, so people so people started getting rid of the note to their meanings. And so, the inverse who flash in 10 I love them for this attorney general's office four lawyers spent three months doing, uhm, ah, a review of all the case law on this. We-- the Supreme court, ah, state of Washington so your state matters on this by the way so don't take this, ah, unless you get your stay. But essentially the bottom line is that, ah, this teams are viewed, a therapy teams and therefore they have the same protection as if you went to your private therapist and told them and that in fact, ah, any consultant who starts you talk to is viewed to sort of life a same as you, so they have the same immunity so to speak for being called. So, the te-- so this is been very good to find out and we'll try to publish this law review. And see you all can kinda watch for it if you have team somewhere. But what it does as, if-- but the whole aim of the team is to get, ah, effectiveness to rule what the therapist does instead of fear or emotionality, ah, or defensiveness, uhm, or over empathy. So, that's the goal of the team and the teams meet weekly. Uhm, and the focus is on the therapist behavior. 

00:55:30
Solution Was to Provide A Dialectical Balance Client Therapist Team Next Problem to Solve 6. Getting an NIMH RO1 grant required at least one mental disorder as one inclusion criteria My choices were BPD or MDD as both were related to suicide I chose BPDs 

00:55:35
MARSHA LINEHAN You have to know enough about the client of course to know what the therapist should be doing. Uhm, my next problem was I couldn't get a grant. You know, this is completely different I couldn't get a grant because they said I had to have a diagnosis and I couldn't study suicide. It was just really interesting cuz last night on the way here and the-- I got my research scientist called me to say she got enough knowledge, she got enough fabulous review on a grant proposal she's admitted to look at, ah, exposure treatment for the anxiety disorders and within DBT to bring that in etcetera for people meeting criteria for prolonged personality disorder that under any time would be funded but-- and I may just decided not find diagnosis base research on treatment. And so it's over there's not a chance she'll be find out. So at this time historically there's not a change I can be funded without a diagnosis. So, times change. 

00:56:35
Solution Was Provide A Dialectical Balance DSM Diagnosis Problem Behavior Mechanism of disorders Next Problem to Solve 6. Getting an NIMH RO1 grant required at least one mental disorder as an inclusion criteria My choices were BPD or MDD as both were related to suicide I chose BPD 

00:56:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So, the only one I can think of for suicide were as depression of Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder by far has higher suicide rate of panic disorder. And so as you great-- if you're interested in suicide it's the disorder to study. Ah, interest in complex difficult to treat super interesting people, this is so good. 

00:56:55
Solution Was to Provide A Dialectical Balance DSM Diagnosis Problem Behavior Mechanisms of disorder 

00:57:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, so I had the problem behavior and I had the diagnosis and essentially all my research is always been on the problem behaviors really I never published-- we've never analyzed whether we got people to quit meeting criteria for Borderline personality disorder it's never been a huge difference among, ah, ah,-- important to me. 

00:57:20
Next Problem to Solve 7. Develop a model of BPD - Capable of guiding effective therapy - Non-pojerative, engendering compassion - Compatible with current research data 

00:57:20
MARSHA LINEHAN But I then had to develop a, a model because it was no behavioral therapy model, the only models were psychodynamic and it's really I'm sure, you know, but good behaviors do not read psychodynamic books. Okay. Now, I notice that I-- we did-- I would now-- well, I did it-- I read a lot to write this manual but, ah, so I needed a me-- a theory that was capable of guiding effective behavior you need this too, I needed one that would be non-pejorative and in generally compassion I believe this is one of the biggest problems in community mental health. I do a lot of training in community mental health. I'm always surprise that the amount of judgmentalness towards the patients that I find in many groups that I go train. One of the main things I think DBT really has contributed to the field is the insistence non-judgmentalness compassion. And I think it's very easy in our country, the United States and only about people in another country to be extraordinarily judgmental cuz I if you watch the news even for three days or something you probably get more judgmental just listening to the judgmental statements. And so our country is very judgmental in the way they talk about people the way they say what are the people's motives are and they have no idea what your motives really are. And so that's been I think one of our contributions is the insistence on dropping judgmentalness, uhm, and knowing compassion interpretations of behavior. But also I had be compel with current research.

BPD is a Pervasive Disorder of the Emotional Regulation System BPB criterion behaviors function to regulate emotions or are a natural consequence of emotion dysregulation 

00:58:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So, the model of DBT which was a big battle at the beginning despite everybody come around to agree with me now this is for Borderline personality disorder is that Borderline personality disorder is a pervasive disorder of the emotional regulation system. What it boils down to is-- and this where DBT is effective, DBT is effective in any emotion dysregulation set of problem. That's where it home, that's where it's good, that's where it can treat. And so, I'm-- later on I'm ganna show you all of the, a lot of the treatment studies and particularly what is been very effect out. But, uhm,-- and it's primarily effective in the emotion regulation. And now a lot of action is a result about a control emotion. So, you know, I have a client who comes in, one of my clients who comes in that she was hurt and she's angry, angry, angry, you know, everything I say she screams, yells all that that and I just sit there and say, "You know, you're avoiding sadness again. I can see it you're avoiding sadness." "Just who I am." I said, "Well, you know, let's see if you can do sadness for manner of it, okay?" And she's a client really that can't do sadness without, ah, then, you know, it's been a major thing to get her to experience sadness, okay. But the anger was really out to avoidance emotion. So that angry is not always angry a lots of time for very good reasons. But it's in avoidance emotion and then, uhm, self injury, ah, regulate some emotion and if you don't know this believe me let me tell you the data is overwhelming that cutting regulates emotions. On almost anyone who does it don't do it I'm not suggesting that you it, it's not effective. Ah, you end up with scars for life, you can't get rid of them, it's a bad idea but the facts are its extraordinarily affect it. And so when these kids find out about it it's almost like being addicted-- it as good as alcohol or drugs. And, ah, it's not illegal so it's kinda safer for teenager so this is part of the problem. But suicide is an emotional regulation behavior, people wanna commit suicide because of unbearable emotional anguish. So, that's what we're dealing with its unbearable emotional anguish. And, ah, that's indeed that's, that's, ah, that's what Borderline personality disorder is and that's what DBT is really design to deal with effectively.

Solution Was to Provide A Dialectical Model of Pathogenesis Biological Regulation Disorder Invalidating Social Environment Transaction 

01:01:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, I had to have a model of how people got that way because most people haven't you notice the clients come in it doesn't mean interest how much you wanna help them, they wanna figure out how is that that I'm this-- why am I this way. You know, and you-- and the behavior sometimes you think, "Well, that's not important was figure how to change you. Cuz what cause you to be this way may not be with maintaining you be in this way and we know that there's a lot of research on that." But the facts are you can't get away from it cuz clients wanna know. And parents are clearly wanna know when they have a child. And I so I end to-- so I had-- so I thought, "Okay, I have to figure out why it was my theory. I have to figure out what I thought." Now, the thing about this just to be clear my theories always fits the data. And the reason for that is when the data change as I change the theory. Okay. So sound of problem. I mean I, I have no problem changing my theories. Okay. Cuz theories are just theories anyway, you know, there's seem to mind of somebody. And so, uhm, I've already change it once we already have, just have a big article out where we not find the theory because of the data, because of data. But, the basic idea is one that's biological regulation disorder. The thing about it, is that, you know, you probably all know this which is they've no doubt it is that, you know, you probably all know this which is, there's no doubt about an emotionality has a genetic opponent. Just no doubt it, okay. So, there's the genetics. There's no doubt be on that, that what happens in the uterus, what happens to mom when she's pregnant, and, and inner uterine factors particularly stress in things like that have a huge effect on the fetus and that can also have an effect. So even with the different set of genes depending on what goes on during pregnancy and then you can have physical trauma particularly if you it when you're young. They can also have a big effect but a good example of the big effect on emotionality which we've all seeing is the veterans coming back with, uhm, the, the head injuries. And then you've seeing so many of them who are out of control emotionally often. So, ah, or a person who has stroke might be. So we know that there's, ah, strong biological basis too high and extreme or out of control emotional so that's one, okay? And then two, it's the, ah, you have an environment that can either make it get worse, make it get better of being neutral. Okay. Now, why did I select the invalidating social environment there was no research by the way what so ever on childhood precursors when I dealt with all this stuff. 

01:04:00
Solution Was to Provide A Dialectical Model of Pathogenesis Biological Regulation Disorder Invalidating Social Environment Transaction 

01:04:00
MARSHA LINEHAN But you have to remember what's the function of emotions there is why to animals and humans have emotions. And there are three basic functions the first is to communicate. Emotions is communicate to others as probably not first, the first probably is to act effect. All emotions happen to behavior associate with them. When you're angry you wanna tacked. When you're afraid you wanna run. When you love you wanna reach out and be go-- be close. When you're envious you wanna either get what the other person has or destroy what they've got. Ah, you wanna-- you'd make things equilibrium, you wanna make, make you more equal to them. And when you're jealous you wanna hold on to every you've got and make and not letting anybody else get close. Dah-dah-dah. All the emotion are like that. So that's that but the second is that they function is to communicate. So, just think about it tsunami is coming or let's say that I see a fire in the back and I wanna get all of us out here, okay. Now, uhm, let's not say that because probably if I said anything better convoys we'd have a stampede. So, I'll say that have a tsunami and you're on the beach with your kids and you hear-- you had heard on the radio open to your place you were staying. The tsunami is coming that everyone is got to get off the beach and you go down there and your children are down on the beach you wanna get off the beach. So how do you think you would get them off the beach? You could walk down and say, "Listen I was listening to the radio and said that we should run." You know, nobody is gonna-- you're not gonna get them off in time. You can down there said, "Run! Come on let's go!" And you wouldn't even try to explain it to them. You know, you just show scream and push and get them to go. Okay. So, that the function of emotions is to communicate to other people. Now, the question is what happens when your communication is not gotten is not received. Okay, so you go down and say, "Run!" And the kids say, "Oh, I wanna play some more, mommy." You know, what is mommy do? You don't say, "Oh, come on, honey." You know what you do is you escalate, but when you escalate the other person escalates. If they don't believe you. So, in general what happens is there's an escalation of the person whose invalidating, and the person being invalidated. Try to communicate more and communicate more and communicate more. So you can see how vicious cycle can get set up to get up keep a person more emotion than they might have been otherwise. So that's where the theor-- theory came from there's a lot of, not a lot of research data on this as an important factor although there's fair amount. but I wouldn't say several warming.

Solution Was to Provide A Dialectical Model of Pathogenesis Biological Regulation Disorder Invalidating Social Environment Transaction Next Problem to Solve 8. Patient populations differ due to differential diagnosis and problems, different context and environment and also due to different cultures 

01:06:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, the next problem was the patient population is different do the differential diagnosis, problems, context, environment and different cultures. So the question is what to do about that. So, I have a treatment that had a lot of research data and everybody want to use it for other things. At 2:30 we're gonna take a break by the way so that's-- and I just wanna be clear you're gonna have to use your skills to get back. Because I'm not good at remembering things like that. So Sally(ph) is gonna have to stand up and say, "Marsha, it's time for break. Okay." And when you do we will have a break. As I say to all my kids, we teach them in to personal skills of how to ask for things so I never end group and I never have breaks unless the kids could sta-- can use their skills, okay. So, well let's practice something new. Now it would be some DBT people and you're willing to stand up and say, "It's time." Okay, so, the many you have an evidence base treatment and you change it there's no longer evidence practice. So you need to keep that in mind, okay? So, and you really need to keep it mind once Obamacare comes in because the facts they reco-- gonna require evidence base treatments. And, ah, you're gonna have to-- they're not gonna, they're not gonna be willing to pay for a lot of none evidence base treatment as far as we can tell. Of course as behaviors we thrilled about that. 

01:08:05
Example 8. Adolescents differ from adults - Targets must be developmentally appropriate - Liability issues differ - They live with parents & family - Capabilities differ - Cognitive processing differs 

01:08:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So, the first thing to remember I found out now that I'm treating was adolescence are different than adults, okay. For one you have-- the targets have to be developmentally appropriate but I haven't found that to be a big problem with the liability issues are definitely different. And, ah, they live with their parents and family so in, ah, in adults, adults come to skills training by themselves but with adolescence we all do it with the family it's, it's the parents and the child have the skills training together. Now some people do them separately but most do them together. So you're teaching the parents the skills, you're teaching the adolescence of the skills. The capabilities are completely different and they're cognitive processing is very different particularly adolescence you don't have the ability to recognize and be rule by long term consequences like adults are. And so, you know, it's one of the reasons, ah, we don't put them on death row. 

01:09:05
Solution Was to Stretch DBT without Changing it to non-DBT Modify Only Where Absolutely Necessary Keep Everything Else EB DBT 

01:09:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, so what's the solution? The solution is you have to modify where absolutely necessary and keep everything else. Now, you're unlock when it comes to adolescence we've already modified and done research on DBT. We've done research on self injuring Borderline personality disorder and I'm doing research on high risk for suicide, uhm, and they were slight to solo on that basis that they had to be extremely high risk for suicide. And, ah, and so we know that changes for adolescence.

01:09:45
MARSHA LINEHAN DBT is also been use in many other country it's all over the world and as you probably know many of you. And, ah, almost everybody said earlier and have to change it. Here you can have to change it. Here you can have to change it here. But in reality that's required very little change in different cultures. It's been a surprise what we tell everyone to do is use, ah, by the book and only change if doesn't working and that's what I would say, "I do that myself I follow other people's mails, I mean I don't change other people's treatment on mails until they fail. You know, when they fail then you have to do something but the trick with evidence base mails who follow the male by the book first and tell you run into trouble.

01:10:25
MARSHA LINEHAN So DBT for Substance dependence which we you've done-- I've done three on heroin and one on other drugs and we definitely had to make changes there mainly to treat the drug addiction not to treat everything else. And, uhm, the first thing is that in the quality of life behaviors drug use became number one. If you're treating eating disorders in quality of life Â­eating disorder becomes number one in quality of life. Uhm, life threatening behavior stage number one. Therapy referring behavior stages now serious therapy referring behavior stages number two. Uhm, I've-- oh, in the third is, I-- it's just not in my mind right now. Now, quality of life or skills be-- state number three and then, ah, the-- then the thing that comes up is so drug use. Now, the thing we found out about drug abuse just compared to suicidal people as there's a huge difference in attachment that's really what happened. And it turns out if those of you have thre-- very many suicidal people. Suicidal people their community become the mental health community. So they became attach to us, I mean they could have stay patients for the rest of their of their lives actually many of them. And it's like they became attach to us but there was no problem with them, okay. And if you wanted to reinforce a suicidal person you could give them an extra session particularly when they met criteria for Borderline personality sort to wasn't in adolescent. Okay. You could give them an extra session but if you want to reinforce a drug user you could tell them they didn't have to come for a session. Because they have a very different community namely they're drug using prints. Okay. Now, largely with our adolescence if I wanna give them, uhm, a reinforce I can make their individual session with me shorter because they don't like long sessions. They love skills training now, okay? So, uhm, and for them what's reinforcing is the more adolescence you've got in your group the more the better years for them. So we've had develop a whole series of attachment strategies and I'm not gonna go overall of him here but we developed them all and, ah, and worked on to keep clients attach to the treatment. The other things is we do urinalysis three times a week, ah, that was done primarily for us to get, uhm, ah, data but there's a lot unbelievable amount of research with any kind of substance abuse that vouchers are effective. So you do urinalysis and you put them on a behavioral pattern of when they get reinforced and they get vouchers. That would be part of DBT except that night the National Institute of Drug Abuse refuse to let us do it because they said we know that works we don't wanna find out if it works. We wanna find out if your treatment works and I said, "Yeah, but my treatments behavioral so we do all behavioral things. So sorry I can't do it." So, that's the one thing that wasn't in our studies that I would definitely put in because using vouchers is effective and when you take lot vouchers you get very low relapse. So it's very effective. So even though it's not in a research you-- with heroin you're gonna use replacement medication which wi-- I don't know if any other disorder you that with but you'll be a full not to do it. Uhm, and, uhm, and then we develop in entire set of why we call the addiction skills, okay? And these are for any sort of addiction which is any pattern of behavior this dysfunctional that you can't change. So, we have an whole new set of skills just for that.

DBT for Substance Dependence â¢ â¢ Targeting: - Drug use at top of quality of living targets â¢ Participant maintenance in treatment: - Attachment strategies â¢ Modification of Contingency Management Strategies - UAs 3x week/vouchers - Replacement medication â¢ Skills Next Problem to Solve 9. Standard DBT is very good at treating Axis I disorders with "out-of-control" behaviors DBT anxiety disorders not ordinarily targeted with suicidal clients and, if not targeted outcomes not as good as behavioral treatments treating anxiety disorders in non- 

01:14:20
MARSHA LINEHAN The next problem that we run into was we decided to look and see how standard DBT works with disorders other than suicidal behavior and drug addiction and to, and to look at what was the pattern with axis one disorders not-- well there is an axis now but with mental-- other metal disorders we decided to look at that, okay. And we did diagnostic assessment to the study to see what was going on. And, uhm, anxiety disorders-- not anxiety itself. Anxiety itself is targeted but specific anxiety disorder set just PTSD, ah, social phobia. And, ah, panic disorder for example are not o-- ah,-- NOCD are not ordinarily, ah,-- are not often targeted in DBT although it's, ah, they've o-- targeting them is always been in the treatment manual, okay? But what happen was when people come in with high suicidal and bunch of other things a lot of therapist thought this since we didn't talk much about it you probably shouldn't do it. 

01:15:25
Working to Improve DBT Out comes for DSM Disorders: % Remitted 87% 68% 64% 47% 39% 35% 

01:15:25
MARSHA LINEHAN So, we looked at our data and here's what they are. First look over to the left, this was in a big study we did comparing DBT with expert therapy in the community so this was not treatment as usual this was treatment by experts selected by, ah, by the top people in the field in the city of Seattle who they thought were the best therapist in the city, they just couldn't be behavioral therapist. Now, this not a compare some-- this was the study. First of all we had 87% remission rate of substance dependance disorders. The bottom I'm telling you right now the one that 87 is substance dependance disorder, okay? I'm gonna have to read them to you cuz I can hardly read them myself. Someone put the-- I did not put this slide together and I do not take credit for it but nonetheless. That's a very high reduction rate and I don't think we've gotten that high in another sales but we've gotten very high. DBT is very good for substance disorders particularly for people with lots of other disorders. You know, D-- there's no reason to have DBT if we have only one disorder. Me-- frankly unless it's suicide but other than that DBT-- but the next one is major depression 68% there's no pharmacotherapy better and there's no psychotherapy better. DBT is just good as any treatment this is very high reduction compared to other treatments, so it's extremely good at that. It was very good and eating disorder 64% these are remissions from the disorder and well into study, okay? But the 47% for panic disorder 39% for anxiety disorder and 35% for PTSD disorder while-- no it look reasonable they're not good compared to the actual treatments for those have prolonged explore and the explore base treatments. So, there was a big problem and we realized that what was happening was is that for many people those disorders were not their number one problem. And if it's not, if it's not on your list of problems DBT done targeted. So, de-- this is sort to what-- and substance abuse is always targeted cuz we track it every week. Major depression is not track but misery, yes, emotional misery is tracked every single way. And eating disorder is not usually tracked either unless a clients put it on their list have something to be track cuz we track behaviors every week. 

01:18:00
The problem further 9. High risk individuals may not be able to tolerate the stress of exposure-based treatments for anxiety without escalating suicidality or Non Suicidal Self-injury(NSSI) 

01:18:00
MARSHA LINEHAN So what we did was to solve this is, ah, the problem was everyone was afraid that high risk individuals, high suicide risk could not do exposure treatment, okay? And I made people worry about that by saying in my book, "You should be careful', but that's all I said, I never said, "Don't do it." I just said, "Be careful", but everyone took that as you can't do, I'm not kidding, every single person did. Except me and I have always done it. 

01:18:30
Solution Was to Combine DBT Contingency Management DBT Exposure Protocol EB DBT 

01:18:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so what happen was we did a study we found out this is amazing, this is worth for long exposure. It turns out when you think about prolonged exposure treatment the people afraid of that or therapist not patients. As it turns out we look at this. We as the patients what therapy they wanted. They could have prolonged exposure by yourself, prolonged of exposure with DBT or DBT by yourself and not have prolonged exposure. Now, one single person said they did not want prolonged exposure in a big study that we did, okay? So, what we have discovered is, is that, ah,-- so what we told patients was, "You can have prolonged exposure if you change your behavior and you have to go a certain amount of time without harming yourself to get it." And it's effective treatment cuz it is, I'm sure you probably know that's very effective prolonged exposure. We says, "It's an effective treatment and you can have it if you go so much time, uhm, without so-- any self harm or su-- self behavior and you obviously have to come into therapy because you can't do therapy without coming to therapy." And what we found was people would stop behavior to get an effective treatment. I frankly wanna cry when I think about this. I think if-- when you find something out like that and you realized that you have been with holding a treatment from people who would stop trying to kill themselves to get it you realized that, "What if our clients in the world are killing themselves because they can't get effective treatment. So this is one of the be-- I feel one of our biggest pointing this is Melanie Harned and my research scientist really it's all for work primarily and, uhm, the DBT exposure is work-- is been very effective, ah, cuz obviously it works. There's, you know, you can't the other top treatment as you probably know is the cognitive, uhm, therapy for prolonged exposure and the problem with that with our clients who are so disordered and disorganized is that they really don't have the capacity to, to cognitively process, ah, enough to change cognition. So they're very rigid their cognitive thinking. And a cognitive intervention is not so effective with review, and, ah, ah, number of people discover this so we've move more towards the prolonged exposure. Now, you're being asking how bad, uhm, was the other one EMDR. Now, you know, EMDR works just as well without all of the other stuff in other words the reason EMDR war-- works is because of expose-- ah, prolonged I mean if you take everything away it still works. So why would you do EMDR? You do EMDR because a lot of therapist like it, that's why and I can see-- you know, we've got-- and, and there's no reason not to do it, it didn't have bad outcomes as far as I know in fact it's got the same amount comes this belong. So you just have to do a lot more stuff but the, the problem we have with treating PTSD primarily is the therapist so we-- you know, any therapy that therapist will use that has get outcomes you should use so I've say go for it. But what I do have to say is do not treat PTSD. So, we have six minutes I thought someone whose gonna ready to jump us and I was gonna have to say, "I'm sorry about six more minutes.

Next Problem to Solve 10. DBT + intensive case management: - Intensive case management + - On-call crisis intervention + Solution Was to Combine DBT Contingency Management DBT Exposure Protocol EB DBT Next Problem to Solve 10. DBT + intensive case management: 

01:22:10
MARSHA LINEHAN You always lucky because I'm gonna get through all of this and then we're gonna look at data and I'm gonna talk to you about what research I think you are had to do in your clinical practice because what's gos-- what has to happen next is clinicians have to start being the researchers in the field not the re-- not the academics. So, the next thing that happen was we-- I did a study, uhm, where I wanted to see whether you really needed all of DBT, okay. So that was the study so of course I believe that you did. So, ah, because I was so sure that you did so we decided to compare to a DBT where you took out individual DBT and you put in intensive case management. Intensive is intensive they had a case load of six high suicidal patient. This is not the 80 that you have in community and known that a lot of the time where the 40, okay they had 80. And they took phone calls and, uhm, so the patients as needed so you can see them everyday of the week which DBT really can't do but they can or they could see them once a month depending on what they thought they needed. Now, ah, and all the patients got skills training, okay. We did another one where they got no skills training but they got DBT individual therapy, all right? So, I was so sure that you needed standard DBT that I decide I didn't wanna let somebody die just to make a point. So, I decide that what we would do is give every single therapist the DBT suicide risk assessment and management protocols and strategies. And only that but we've got-- we hired the pharmacotherapist to do prescribing a medication when needed and we got that pharmacotherapist also using the DBT suicide risk assessment of management protocol. So in another words every single person in this study was using it. Now, this is no small thing because the way it was set up then is that no one manage suicide except the primary therapist and the pharmacotherapist never hospitalized they them send them to the case manager or the DBT individual therapist and the skills trainers for hospitalized are do anything they sent them back too. So we had a system where you-- the o-- only one person can put a person in hospital or in ER, okay. This is no small pick to get this, this structured and they were all using DBT. Now, here is the data, the data was e-- all three groups on suicide during the treatment year were identical. Now she was absolutely no difference in suicidal behavior at all. The only difference was then follow up and then follow up-- well the difference was individual therapy without skills was not as good on anxiety and standard DBT was better in follow up and keeping people out o the hospital and keeping them out to the emergency room. Nervous when they weren't being treated. They, they basically had a better long term outcome essentially. So, this research which is we've just admitted for pa-- we're just now submitting from publication and that's because we were so-- it was so, it was so against what we thought that we had to centered out for almost a year and it realized by a lot of people because it's gonna have such, ah, you know, co-- could have such a big impact on what happens next.

01:25:45
MARSHA LINEHAN The uhm,-- so the question was how to interpret this and what was important? Everyone was doing DBT so there was nobody not doing DBT that was not the issue. But the issue was, was what type of DBT they were doing and so when we get back from break I'm gonna go through and talk to you about one when I think was important wa-- possibly without research we can't really know. I'm gonna talk to you about what I think you should o in treatment of highly suicidal people and what data I think you you should collect form your patients because I'm quite sure now that what we're going to have to is we're gonna have to take studies like this and move them out to you all in the community and started saying you've got to start tracking and you've got to start looking in what works and what does it in publish or finding someone else to publish what you find out. But what we've got to do is start communicating so I'm gonna through what I think is really going on and we have a lot of other data that suggest what's important and what's not in treating the multi-disorder difficult to treat high risk individual. So these are the people, you know, I feel like I wanna say to people for another massacres in the patient to us. And, uhm, you know, cuz these are the your high risk people, but I'm sure many of you are treating them. You may not-- they may not be quite as high risk but you've got them. So we're gonna take-- I can't see how you could have a 10 minute break unless they have six floors of bathrooms. Uhm, so-- but I also don't want-- so I think what would take is say, How long have your breaks been in this room? Fifteen, 15 is that reasonable? Okay.

MARSHA LINEHAN I want to take about, uhm,-- I wanna make a point here and then I'm gonna take some questions which is at the, uhm, affective this research, how to interpret this research was to put, uhm, uhm, much heavier emphasis on DBT skills and I'm gonna talk about that little bit later. But what I wanna do now is, uhm, see, uhm, or I'm gonna take some questions at the end but I also wanna see if they're any question so far you've gotten to sort of basic development of the treatment I'm gonna go in now that what I think is critically important in the treatment in what might not be. So there is, ah, microphones in this center here and there is microphone over there, and there's microphone over there. So if you come up to the microphone and talk loud we're gonna do about 10 minutes to solve question. Yes. 

01:29:00
UNKNOWN Over the break a number of us were asking if, ah, you have a publication or friends coming on the alterations of DBT for adolescence. 

01:29:10
MARSHA LINEHAN There's a book that we've already publish on adolescence which is DBT for adolescence. And the, the, the modifications are actually not very much, the big modification is you bring family sending for skills training. And the other modifications are that pe-- this with highly suicidal kids but with any kids you have to have what you can do up to, uhm, you know, like once a mount family session so you can do sessions with the family. You can-- you end up what, what we do in, uhm, in our skills training is the skills trainer coaches the parents and, and individual therapist coaches the co-- the team. So, the main thing you didn't wanna do is have one person coaching both cuz they have total conflict of interest, ah, most of the time. So those are the big changes but we also, ah, you know, there's a lot of tracks at the trade to dealing with adolescences and it's Alec Miller-- I'm the third author but Alec Miller is the first author 

01:30:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:30:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

01:30:15
UNKNOWN Some of... 

01:30:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, sorry. Are you there? Yes. 

01:30:20
UNKNOWN I... 

01:30:20
MARSHA LINEHAN It's to help a little now. Yeah. 

01:30:20
UNKNOWN Okay. I appologize in advance for asking what maybe an impertinent question but this was... 

01:30:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. You have to start over now - 

01:30:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:30:25
MARSHA LINEHAN - and now do, and now do it, and now do, and now do itself put down. 

01:30:30
UNKNOWN This morning I went to the EMDR presentation where Francine Shapiro was saying the prolonged exposure for PTSD is doesn't work or as, as deleterious is certainly not as effective as EMDR and that doing the back and forth eye thing was very important and that the research now supported doing that and not just the tones are tapping. To... 

01:30:55
MARSHA LINEHAN It be good to see those research studies my understanding is that there are not those research studies. 

01:31:00
UNKNOWN She's just publishing it. 

01:31:00
MARSHA LINEHAN That we know for a fact prolonged exposure works there's 100s of studies on it. 

01:31:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:31:05
MARSHA LINEHAN So you have to be sure that the research is done by independent people we're gonna talk about that with DBT. You can't really consider a treatment affective when the only person whose done where are those trials is the person who develop that. You've got to have other people. Thank you. And that's the, the status of the American psychological association has put out criteria for what to defines a treatment affective. Is your personal behavior? Yes. Probably the lights make it hard to see so speak up. Yes? 

01:31:35
UNKNOWN I, I-- you had, uhm, started to talk about, uhm, book about problem solving in the ne-- member of the author I'm wondering if you remember it now what the name of the book. 

01:31:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Necu that came to me. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN What the tittle? 

01:31:45
MARSHA LINEHAN N-E-C-U. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:31:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Uhm, I have a center. I have, ah, ah, institute Linehan Institute so you might be able to remember the name just because it's my last name. But if you go on Linehan Institute I think I'm not certain about this by think Linehan institute sells books that irrelevant and therefore, you know, we can probably get up a list to what I consider to be the core books aside to DBT books the other books that are really important. And-- so problem solving aren't need there. Okay, I'll do the middle again. 

01:32:20
UNKNOWN When, ah,-- can you able to understand when you're doing DBT with those who were telling with substance use you're placing substance use under quality of life in that place on the har... 

01:32:30
MARSHA LINEHAN It's the top, top of quality of life. 

01:32:30
UNKNOWN Right. Why not at life threatening for some individuals that is life threatening. 

01:32:35
MARSHA LINEHAN If it's eminently life threatening they could die tomorrow. 

01:32:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:32:40
MARSHA LINEHAN And the person was drinking such that they are endanger of time within the next 24 hours they need to put it up there. But in general alcoholic drugs are not life threatening. You know, in the same way to cigarettes are not even though cigarettes number one drug that causes death. I mean it's the highest cause of death there is far more than drugs and alcohol and we don't target that. So, uhm,-- and w don't target alco-- we, uhm, and so it would have to be that the person, ah, for example if I have a person who calls in suicidal I'll ask if they're drinking cuz if they been drinking on less three hours but that's not alcoholism that just means they drink in less three hours. So, in general very few people die imminently from alcohol and drugs. Some people do but they drink they, they did from driving faster. I mean there are million things that kill people. So, ah, so that's why but we make it number one in quality of life which means he's targeted every week and we turn we track use of DBT has that record we track every single way use of illicit drugs, use of alcohol. How much you've had of everything? Use of prescribe medication, is over the counter the medication and, ah, HIV risk behaviors. We target, we have, ah,-- we ask que-- we ask those questions every single week. So, uhm, the, uhm,-- and you'll be amaze once you find out particularly from over the counter drugs. Because a person starts taking over the counter discover to have all kinds of physical disorders that you didn't know about. So, it's not like we don't lis-- we don't about it, we do if we think do-- doing too much would might bring it up but it's, it's not gonna be the main target. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN Thanks. 

01:34:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN Over here. I'm wondering if you have more information on National - 

01:34:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, it get closer into that. 

01:34:35
UNKNOWN - national certification for DBT. 

01:34:40
MARSHA LINEHAN What? 

01:34:40
UNKNOWN National certification for DBT for us. 

01:34:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Certification for DBT? 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, do you know more about that? 

01:34:45
MARSHA LINEHAN It will be international actually. We're going to develop certification for DBT that will be we're looking for the international certifier of certifiers. There's a group that certifies all of certifiers it turns out including police departments, first aid people, you know, welders. So they certify everyone who can certify anyone so getting certify by them requires that you follow in the enormous among of good rules. So we're developing certification and we have a board as the Linehan DBT board of certification and we, ah,-- are only thing that's only kept us from doing more is money in the sense it turns out sort of my brothers pointed out to me, "So, Marsha, nobody wants to donate money for certification." And I've discovered that a lot of therapist were just assume not have certification mainly because by this you're be able to say you're doing your treatment when you're not doing it if you don't wanna learn it. Because people make fortune on DBT - 

01:35:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:35:50
MARSHA LINEHAN - and so there are lot of people we know doing DBT saying they're doing DBT or not doing it which is the only reason we're trying to go certification. 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:36:00
MARSHA LINEHAN And we-- so it should be up with any year. So - 

01:36:05
UNKNOWN Great. 

01:36:05
MARSHA LINEHAN - uhm, in insurance companies first we could tell we figure out and we'll insurance companies to pay higher but you can actually get insurance companies to pay higher for DBT you can convince and you train by somebody, you know, who knows the treatment because there's a lot now we've done workshops on how do you get insurance companies actually pay for these whole treatment was there most of them are willing to do. So let me go here and then you and then all get back to what we're doing, yes? 

01:36:30
UNKNOWN So I have hop up when the person, ah, was speaking about the EMDR - 

01:36:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

01:36:35
UNKNOWN - I learned prolonged exposure therapy this past year at Ohio State University and I've use it twice successfully and I'm really so in to that and I really love it a lot. 

01:36:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

01:36:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, I also-- I-- since I'm not a DBT therapist I wanted to find out how if I'm in Ohio I can go about becoming one and going to the training. 

01:37:00
MARSHA LINEHAN You know, there are a lot of people doing training DBT. Linehan Institute obviously is one place to call to find out but there are number of other-- there are number of people that are not but if I were you no matter who's doing it I call Linehan Institute just find out if they're people who actually we know, know t he treatment cuz there are a lot people now teaching DBT but the treatment they're teaching at least they-- when I find out what they're doing I say, "That's not DBT", they say, "Yes it is". I said, "Look it and I can tell you it's not DBT." And they say, "Yes, it is." And I say, "Well--" eh-- and they learned it from another group and there's another group have developed apparently I'm not sure if it's really true but they look like they develop something that's not the same treatment this when I developed and called it DBT. So but-- we-- Linehan Institute does training bel-- with their co-- in the United States they are number of very good groups who do it and, uhm, most states have good trainers in them. So call Linehan Institute and find out - 

01:38:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:38:00
MARSHA LINEHAN - who you-- uhm, who it is. And, uhm, if you're good be-- if you already know behavior therapy to be honest with you it's pretty-- DBT is not really hard to learn if you know behavior therapy the problem is learning behavior therapy. So, those of you wanna learn DBT the first thing to do is try to learn some basics in behavior therapy. Yes? You're gonna be my last one. Okay. 

01:38:20
UNKNOWN Ready? 

01:38:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

01:38:25
UNKNOWN Okay. I know you're hoping to do some, some work on teaching us about research but I'm wondering if you could give us, ah, hands on clinical experience of DBT in action which is part of I, I think would be interest a lot of us in action. 

01:38:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Was that mean in action? I don't know even know. 

01:38:40
UNKNOWN Show us how you use it and how many of you can have your clients respond to it and how, you know, what the protocol is. 

01:38:50
MARSHA LINEHAN I don't have a live example. For DBT we've got-- you'd have to be in role play because you'd have to be suicidal etcetera, but I'll, I'll tell you about some of clients. I had a client right now who had, ah, came in to a research study and, uhm, for PTSD and had Borderline personality disorder and she was, ah, pimped out I just want-- I think I told you about, I might have told you about sort of pimped out at age three to age 16. At age 16 she was put in a foster home but then they pulled out to the foster home since they were all having sex with there too. The pimping out was successive conscience sexual abuse it's the best way to part it. I mean, ah, the stories are sort of like I never heard in my entire life. So she came in to be part of the PTSD. She never been attach to anyone in her life. Ah, and in the PTSD program she got for the very first time in her life attached and, uhm, uhm, at about the 6-mouth play said that if they-- if we made her end up the end of the research study she would kill herself. Ah, she-- during that treatment she had five intensive care suicide attempt and on the last of ther-- but, but the problem was because there was a research grant we really had to stop at one year and she had to be out of therapy for three months then she could come back. Had we-- at the six-month point realize how serious the problems were we would have told her that time that we will continue to to see her and we would not have had for that three months in. But the problem was we didn't know it was that severe at that time so what happen then was that she started being extraordinarily physically aggressive-- I mean verbally aggressive towards your therapist calling, telling or kinds of things. Calling her all the time, ah, and bearing with her life sending horrendous emails. Writing emails to me as the director of the clinic about what is your the therapist was. How can I do this? What a terrible personality was etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And the therapist because she really love the client and care would, uhm, do extra things for to try to help suit her to help her feel cared about because she was ending. And of course the affect of this was to continue to reinforce suicidal behavior so client got worse that therapist got kinder. So we got to the end it was the say that she was gonna kill herself and the therapist came to see me to see what to do .A nd I told to the therapist, I said, "Look, there's only thing you can't do is continue to see her because if you do she'll be dead. Because if we reinforce again at this level we will never stop this behavior. So this is where the courage of a therapist you're willingness to set with the fact that person could die is required so she-- I said we may not continue this year. On the other hand we may not she's on the no admit list of every hospital in Seattle and we know if no therapist in Seattle that would have treated her. This is one of the big problems with this patient this were usually often the only people willing to treat them. So, I said, "Because we can't kick her out because she's too serious and she'll kill herself for sure if we just let her go she will kill herself. So we agree that I would see her even though I had no opening and I have to see her for free because she can't pay a bit. So, I picked her up as a client that down and I started the session and he's planning on killing yourself today. She said, "Yes", I said, "You realized if you tell me that I'm probably gonna have to do something about and I'm not gonna be able to let you just kill yourself to death." She said, "Well, I'm going to." And I said, "Well, all right, so we'll have to talk about that and I drop it and talk about other things. At the end I-- although we don't hospitalized very often at the end, I said, "You know, I'm going to continue seeing you." She said, "No you're not. I don't trust you. You're gonna do to me just way she did. She's terrible and you're gonna be terrible." And, ah, she wore hoodie and sat like this in entire session. So, ah, I finally said, I said, "Look, would you feel safer if I put in hospital for one night?" I said I won't do it for longer but I would do it for one night just because this is your last day you're not gonna see this clinic therapist again with that help. She said, "Yes", I said, "All right. I'm gonna do that then. I'm gonna get you in and we're gonna have you stay one night and I'm gonna talk them to take you even though you kick in their doors and broke whatever it was that they thought that was important." She go freak out, "There was something I keep saying-- you know give me a break." Not serious she saw-- latest with her they locked her up because they say she assaulted a police officer. I said, "What are you talking about? You can't give the shows for god sakes is not assaulting a police officer." And so, I'll tell you about that later trying to get out the hospital really, ah, ah, a total nightmare, ah, when she-- after that. So, anyway-- so she goes in, okay? So then she comes in-- here's how our sessions go. So, you know, I sit down and I said, "Okay. So, you're gonna have to look me you're feeling are feeling ashamed? Or you feeling afraid?" And so, then she will get angry and I said, "Okay, anger I figure what's going here as anger is a escape from sadness." What do you think you're probably sad that you've lost your therapist I'll call her Susan(ph) for the moment you've lost Susan(ph). Yes, and then, "You know, you're the one that made it. You made up these rules and how could you have done that? You're terrible. Dah-dah-dah." And I say, "So that angry still in that. So okay." So you're gonna stay angry for while and you think of staying angry the whole session or just for while? I said, so,-- I said, "So okay, I can see that one of the main things we're gonna have to do is work on getting you to be able to experience sadness." "No, I'm not going to." And I said, "All right." So-- then what happen was she starts calling me the same way she cal the other therapist but she get mad on me on the phone and tell me, "What is your quest?" And I wasn't helping her and why did not help her and I wasn't listening, and why didn't do this. So, I would say this exactly what I say. So, you know when you talk to me like that on the phone it ask me not want to talk to you. And I said, "So, if you keep doing that I'm not gonna wanna talk to you." So after a while I started saying, "I you--"ah, she will hang up on me at the pa-- ah, she get angry and hang up on me. So I said, "You know, when you hang up on me it makes me feel ineffective. When I'm feel ineffective it makes me don't wanna talk. So, if you keep hanging up on me I'm not gonna keep talking to you. You can't talk, talk to me." So I said, "What I want you to--" I say, "It's fine for you to be angry and have to say I need to get off the phone." So you can say, "I need to get off the phone or, Marsha, I'm gonna hang up. Or, Marsha, I'll talk to you later. You can say anyone to those it'll be fine with me." So, uhm,-- oh, sorry I got the-- the-- no that's in second. Before this happen she will call and wouldn't get off the phone, that's what it was. She would not get off the phone and she would cry and not get off. And so then I discover that I don't have a lot of tolerance for se-- hanging up on other people. And I would, ah, if I had to hang up I felt guilty, I felt ineffective, I felt unconfident, I felt like I was a main person, I just can't stand it. So, I said to her-- I-- so I said, "You've got to say goodbye." "Goodbye" and she will say nothing except cry. And so, uhm, finally I said, I had to talk with her in a session and sa-- and this is a kind of thing you would talk about on the phone but you'd have-- you'd always bring up in a session. So she comes in and I said, "You know, when you do that to me I feel really terrible. It's very painful for me to hang up on you, I really don't wanna hang up on you." So, I've realize that if I have to hang up on you then you can't call me for day, you can't call me the next day cuz I figure why would you be any different the next day. So, I figure you're gonna do it to me again. So, the first time she calls and I, uhm, uhm, had to hang up on her she's starts calling back. I think she called 100 times or something like that. So I told my family and everyone of the family I said, on our death best to say anyone answering that phone. Not one single person is going to and we're all gonna survive this. So, uhm, that happen about three times and she started saying, "Goodbye." Okay? Next we got to, ah, her hanging up on me. At which when I went through and I said, "Yeah, I'm feeling confidently hanging up on me. So, if you do that you can't talk to me the next day." So now, we're at the point where I said, I call her more than she calls me. And I said, "What's going here?" She said, "I'm afraid to call you." I said, "Why?" And she said, "Well, I might get angry and then I won't be able to talk to you the next day." So I said, "Okay, that's good thinking on your part. Why don't we work on that? We'll work on had enough be so angry." I said, "Because generally you're angry cuz you made up something in your mind about me. And so in the same way that you do with your boyfriend." I said, "What I've notice is whenever anybody doesn't do what you want you decide they don't love you." Of course she disagree with that but it's true, so she now agrees of course. So, the therapy has gone with me trying to get her to be able to able experience sadness without harming herself and without taking drugs, without taking overdoses. I only have one intensive care overdose. I mean intensive care suicide attempt and we haven't had one in a year. But what I've realize-- and this is one of the important things to recognize there's the people who do really well in six months of DBT. We just have a big study out of Canada on this, there's a big two studies out, out to Canada on this. And they are the people who need five years and this what was gonna talk you all about the need for you all to do research. So, uhm, in general the way therapy starts in DBT as the client comes in you check their moods see what kinda mood they're in I generally with my adolescence and with some-- you know, there's half of your clients wanted just to chat and talk with you and tell you everything in the other hand can tolerate a behavioral intervention so one the wanna cha-- chat all the time. I said, "Okay, I can see that you wanna talking, you need to be able to talk to me so we're gonna divide this session up. You can have this many minutes and I will keep my mouth shut and just listen to you. And then the rest of the time we're gonna work on your problems. Do you wanna have the first hip or the second hip. This jsut the same thing is when you say the kid, "Do you wanna put your left foot out to the ball into the, into the shoe first of your right foot, you know, when they feel a tantrum. So that were that extremely effective. And then, uhm, generally we review the diary which, ah, we started with we always says the first three questions we also ask are, what's your urge to kill yourself-- this not in the book but we've added it. What's your urge to kill yourself-- I would suggest no matter what therapy you're doing you do this. What's your urge to kill yourself right now? What you urge to take drugs or escape right now? And what's you urge to quit therapy right? You'll be surprise what you find out. I just have to go and I thought love therapy as I wish to urge quit therapy for that's on a fight on a scale. So I said, "Well, we're gonna have to talk about that and see what's going here." So, uhm, then in our diary we're tacking highest suicide I issue in everyday. Highest dose drugs everyday. Highest me-- emotional misery everyday, highest physical me-- ah, injury and I got to tell you a physical injury is a lot bigger issue the most therapist think. We have a lot of physical pain in our clients and then we, uhm, do, uhm, you know, alcohol, ellicit drugs over the ke-- prescribe drugs so they're taking their drug medication as prescribe which DBT always saying. You want your, you want taking your medication differently you call your physician or nurse up and get a change. Uhm, and, uhm, what else we can-- and then, uhm, over the counter meds HIV risk. So you're always looking in co-- checking, "Okay, here are the problems what were gonna do?" And then, you figure out what's the serious behavior that has to dealt with that week and you deal with that. Meanwhile, keep your hand on what the underlying sort to issues are which always is avoidance. So what you're trying to do-- you know, I have a little teenager right now whose, uhm, associated I'd say most of the time but she's not really to associate she feels unreal. And she was brought up, uhm, by a drug lord where she had to have a different name all the time and constantly hide. And, ah, her father was murdered and her mother is murder and all kinds of things happened to this kid. So, so I'm with her just trying to get her to feel sensations. I'm she's not can't feel anything, I said, "No wonder but it was--" she said, "Well you can tell women I'm associating and not real I'm-- I look happy and it was totally true. Turn down I said, "Okay, try this." And I have her go like this with her hand, rub her hand. And all of a sudden the spot went away and she just had a normal kind of an ordinary looking face. So, I work with her all the time on, "Okay, we're working on experiencing sensations." And, ah, you spend so much of your life, you know, suppressing and, ah, ah, sensations and feelings that first we have to get you en-touch with your body and the-- you know, your sensations and then we'll figure out what else we're gonna do. But she's-- she use this-- you know, a lot of DBT therapist coaching in skills. So she, she is, ah, is a teen so she comes an says, "Well, Marsha", I say, "I save you." She just go, "What do you mean I use them all?" I said, "You do", I said, "They're only been publish now." She said, "I swear I haven't using it all my life." I said, "Wow! It's gonna be cool, they weren't even publish before. Did you make them up?" "Why made them up myself?" I said, "Oh, you did!" I said, "Well, that's really great, I said to another." She said, "Look." And I take her to my mother, I had to be the mother to my mother and all that. She said "I'm-- I just have to. I've decide I just have to help myself." I said, "Listen, this is fabulous." I said, "You know, what you sound to me kinda like a therapist. How about if you be the therapist would you?" She say, "Yeah, I can take care of myself." I said, "That's great you do that. So do-- you think you can use a coach?" She said, "Yeah", and I said "Good. How about if I'm your coach." She say, "Okay", I said, "Good", So, she comes in and tells me so, "I use wise mind all the time or shut in a wise mind." You know, this is three weeks ago she hated wise mind, say she was never using wise mind, it was a ridiculous skill as she wasn't doing it. Okay, now she's in wise mind all the time. Okay. And in fact she is, I hear that she sa-- ah, she's kinda like a 15-year-old, who sounds like a 30 year old. Or what it is that she has great debt. You know, she told me why she left the Catholic church and I said, "Ride on." I didn't really but I thought it. So, my point is that, it's so very, uhm, one of the treatment goes on and phone calls with your coaching and as you notice for my previous conversation with your clients can't treat you badly on the phone and then on your phone calls. A lot of it goes on and you know when she got in the hospital and kick the police and all that kind of stuff, what was going on then, something. But whatever it was then I had to go down and spend on that two three-- almost three hours getting out there. Maybe cuz they had a new resident, uhm, who then later lived. And, uhm, uhm,-- and so, you know, a lot of the treatment is this kinda, uhm, I so I call her to check in, uhm, so al-- ah, it some, you know, so that's there's a lot of that, is that who ask the question? If that person better still be here all of that stuff. 

01:55:55
[sil.] 

01:56:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Beca-- so that, that feel the and do you think I give you the feeling for what the treatment is. 

01:56:05
[sil.] 

01:56:10
MARSHA LINEHAN I don't like any different with the client than I do with anybody else and one of the main things I'm constantly doing when I'm bring in students you got to train anywhere else I have to undo their training. Uhm, you know, we, we have people like, uhm, who really put on I think about this therapy thing where they act like therapist all the times and they have all these therapeutical that they say which they would never say it on children. If they're, you know, they'll say step to a patient like a pe-- just imagine this, think of the person you love the most just for a moment in your life, okay? Imagine they come in and say, "I feel like killing myself." Okay? And then imagine that you said, "Why? What happened?" And they said, "Oh, my boyfriend broke up with me, I wanna kill myself. I quit therapies." "Ah. You're boyfriend broke up with you, you know, it's probably not that bad. Dah-dah-dah." You know? And you go on like I said, how your really feel in and how do you feel about, all that kind of crap. You know what would the average person say a future child and you said, "What! You're killing yourself over a brief man! Do you lost your mind?" Okay. So, so after that you would necessarily say that to your client but I might, I might so as you-- they have you lost your mind a lot, well, that's not true, oh, give me a break. You're not gonna kill yourself over that, are you? You know I could say stuff like that, so the idea is to treat them the way you would treat a person you care about in your own life. You know, the far as I tell people all the time, you know, you were capable of helping people and then you are helping these people. You need to treat them like they're like you, like other people. And it's quick treating them like there it is, ah, this kind of foreign object, yes. Well, I can't here words you're saying did you-- are you the one that ask me before? Oh, so I want to know did I fill the bill? 

01:57:55
UNKNOWN And answer, and answer to your question it was real material that destruct you... 

01:58:00
MARSHA LINEHAN What? I can't here you. 

01:58:00
UNKNOWN Okay. My question to you was not so much sort of a global run down of a case but how do you integrate the skill training, if you're not doing a group. How do you integrate that with the patient that comes and... 

01:58:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I'll tell you. 

01:58:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:58:15
MARSHA LINEHAN All right? 

01:58:15
UNKNOWN I don't know how this... 

01:58:15
MARSHA LINEHAN I don't think it works very well I just tried it and I finally told the patient, you know, there's the suicidal guy has a job who came in sitting and going and come once awake. And I said, "Okay, fine we'll have 90-minute sessions I'll do 15 minutes to teaching your skills and the rest I will, ah, you know, discuss your life which is always chaos. But I've never told him this is absolutely not working, okay? But part of the reason is, is that the old so it doesn't come to sessions a lot. So, I said, "You know for you, for me to treat you at DBT I could treat you something else but to do DBT you have to learn a skills. And-- but you can't go to our skills groups, let me find you another one in town." So we're looking for that. Uhm, so the-- in general I don't think it works so well. I think people learn the-- there's, there's no, I have no research data on this so this is my opinion. So, you should take that with the greatest result sort of, my belief about it is this, these people really learn skills much better in a group why? Because they hear everybody else's homework. They hear everybody else's difficulty and other people will coach him and give him ideas, okay? My kids all the time talk about it how much they learn and the patients talk nonstop about what they learn from other patients. So my real belief is that you're better off running a group, okay? And if I had to give one skills or individual therapy I've give up individual therapy and do skills only. So, I'm gonna go forward because I'm gonna show you the data that would make you consider doing the same thing and there's good reason to believe that if you, uhm,-- this one I'm gonna talk about, okay? All right.

DBT as treatment for mental disorders only - Experience indicated it could be useful for general public, i.e., those without diagnosed mental disorders - Stigma of mental disorder kept people out of DBT Marsha M. Linehan, Ph.D. 2012 

01:59:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, I'm gonna skip some of this. Okay, so the question is, you know, uhm, is DBT a treatment only for mental disorders? Now, uhm, we've got a lot of experience now that you can run-- that is extremely useful for the general public. I've run groups in psychotherapist but I also run friends and fa-- and if you wanna make money in your clinic the way to do it is friends and family, okay? And these is are this is we make more money doing that and doing anything else. And friends and family is a general public without diagnose mental disorder and people come in and you have about 10 to 11 people in your group and you do it, ah, it takes about 26 weeks to go through all the skills and we, ah,-- average high is this friends and family generally yes. Do you have any in your life has a problem? And it can be your children, it can be your husband or wife, it can be your boss, it could be your mother, it could be anybody. But in general you don't have to even-- it can be Alzheimer's caregivers, it can be people who are stress. It's, it's for anyone in a high stress job. Now, when you watch what adults do with the skills people in jobs practice skills none stop in work, okay, I hear it every way, they all go on practice everything in work. Women often practice on their husbands, uhm, kids practice on their fiends, boyfriends and parent. But the-- so the-- first they dream member is this skills are effective and you can-- if you get trained in the skills or to-- you really had to be trained in DBT the skills are so much trainable on their own sort of in the book that's gonna be out in the end of-- at, ah, at about nine to 12 months. That particular book you'll be able to do it really with-- if you've learn DBT strategies you won't you probably do a good job with, with just the book. It's got every though I've ever had about skills training. There's a stigma of mental disorder that keeps a lot of people out of DBT this is problem. Okay, I have people and I wanted to talk me and the various I saw swear because everyone thinks the Borderline personality disorder. I had a military guy who have seen in secret because he's afraid of the VA ever now as he see me which he's not see me for Borderline personality disorder but they will think he's got personality disorder and he won't get the benefits he's applied for. So there's huge stigma to Borderline personality disorder. And so what you really need to do if you want to have a broad base practice and use DBT is you want to advertise that. You know, it's, it's a good idea to have something going on other than just Borderline personality disorder. 

02:02:40
Solution is to Further DBT Research: DBT focused on disorder DBT Skills for friends, family and schools EB DBT 

02:02:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, you know, the data, okay. Ah, it's also going into the school system which I swear where I think it should pay basically and that's what most people have said is like in this what your mother were suppose to thought you. I say, "Right. But my mother didn't." So we don't practice them all the time everyone who learns the skill of practicism.

02:03:05
MARSHA LINEHAN And, uhm, the very concrete skills. Uhm, I'm gonna skip this-- okay before I go into just some what the research on skills is and what I think you should do I'm just gonna point out to you. Ah, how many of you here a behavior therapist? Almost none of you. Okay, so you probably don't care what DBT added to behavior therapy so just skip that. DBT though was the first psychotherapy with mindfulness in it. So I'd added that to all therapy, uhm, is the skills base treatment all the skills are base on evidence base treatments they're all base on-- they're all research foundations, uhm, DBT puts the big emphasis on therapy self disclosure which is in some non-DB-- non-behavioral intervention not wide in widely done in, ah, behavioral so these are really that kinda unique thing and obviously dialectics which the only therapy that I know is really got dialectics, uhm, is gestalt. 

02:04:20
Where are we Now? Let's Look at the Data to Date, Question by Question, to See Where To go 

02:04:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And when I, I was send uhm, Great Britain, ah, oh, at Cambridge University on Sabbatical and Edna Foa the prolonged exposure person she was there too. So, I was telling when we're there, I said, "You know, we've, I've heard really good things about Gestalt therapy." I said, "I wonder if it works and how it works." She said, "Yeah", and I said, "I think we should learn Gestalt therapy. Do you wanna learn it? Let's learn it and see how it works." She said, "Okay." I said, "Okay, so we need to find a good Gestalt therapist and we'll go to Gestalt therapy and learn how to do it for now." And so she said, "Okay." So she finds us a Gestalt therapist that we could go to, it turns out it been apparently the top Gestalt therapist in Europe. So me and Edna every week we run out to this place out in the bush and somewhere and she has this big house and I'd have therapy upstairs and, and, and it was set down stairs in living room and then I sit in living room, she go up and then all the way home we would analyze the treatment. So, one my very first session I said-- so I think I didn't want her to know I was a treatment developer I ha-- I wen-- well known so much but didn't wanna know extremely developer so I don't know what I told her. So, I just said, I said, "By the way", I said-- but DBT was reasonably well know. I said, "By the way what is Gestalt?" And she says, "Well, it's very dialectical." I almost passed out right on the floor. What I learn from her though, I'll tell you I'm gonna write a book once I got on my other books finished. I'm gonna write a book called, "10 steps getting out to hell." And, ah, and believe I know what's the 10 steps for getting out. So, in one of my steps I learn from her which was, "This has to do with your clients. What a client things they need almost always is actually what they need." You know, most clients know what they need and it's pays-- it's good for us to pay attention to that, that's what I learn from her. All right. So the question is what's important about DBT so now I'm not trying to make a point that it's effective, I'm trying to make a point of what about is effective and what impact should that have on you when you were practice, okay? 

02:06:30
Is DBT Effective? DBT Outcomes in BPD Reduce: â¢ Suicide Attempts â¢ Non-Suicidal Self Injury (NSSI) â¢ Depression â¢ Hopelessness â¢ Anger â¢ Substance dependence â¢ Impulsiveness Increases: â¢ Adjustment (general & social) â¢ Positive self-esteem (introject) (See Lieb, K., et al. 2004) Is DBT Effective? Yes, across a variety of outcomes How Well Does DBT Reduce Suicidal Behaviors? Suicidal & Intentional Self-injurious Acts By Condition and Time Mean # of Arts 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 0-4 months 4-8 months 8-12 months Tx year total Follow-up total DBT Controls (Linehan et at., 1991, 1999, 2002, 2006) Percent Attempting Suicide By Condition and Time % Attempting Suicide 50 40 30 20 10 0 0-4 months 4-8 months 8-12 months Tx year total Follow-up total DBT Controls (Linehan et al., 1991, 1999, 2002, 2006: van de Bosch et al., 2005) DBT compared to Expert Community Therapy â¢ Suicide attempts: 50% â© â¢ ER visits for suicidality: 53% â© â¢ Inpt. admits for suicidality: 73% â© - All remain 50% lower during follow-up 

02:06:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So these are just the data, is it effective? Yes, it is. And, ah, it's over many outcomes that is effective. It reduces suicidal behavior, uhm, for better than treatment as usual but when you compare it expert psychotherapy in the community this was the people that the heads of hospitals, heads of clinics, head of training groups, heads of psychoanalytic institute, all these thing nominated who are the best therapist in Seattle. This was DBT compare to the best therapist we just eliminated behavior therapist. And suicide attempts went down 50% in DBT compared to expert, ah, ER visits for suicidality went down 53% and inpatient emissions went down 73%, so this is huge difference. Ah, and all of remain 50% lower during the follow-ups so there was no change in, in what was going on. 

02:07:30
Can someone besides the treatment developer and her team do the treatment? 

02:07:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So can-- now the big complain is being can someone other than me do this? And this was for years people said the only reason is worse because of Marsha Linehan. And that's when it was done after in University of Washington and it's legitimate. It, it-- it's not really full legitimate to ask if it was just me because my all comes have never been better than other people doing it. But the-- ah, and the standard divia-- you know, the difference between therapist and DBT is very small suggesting that treatments working that si-- si-- differences in outcome. If you 20 therapist doing it there's very small differences in outcome. This is really interesting because there's, ah,-- when we compare to the psychodynamic therapy there's-- in psychodynamic therapy, you, you have a really big difference in outcomes, you know, in other words you've got really good therapist and then really not good therapist. And so it's sort of the quality of a therapist is very important. In cognitive therapy you compared to behavioral activation which DBT has within it behavioral activation, there was also big difference. Behavioral activation in a very small difference of among therapist in outcomes and cognitive therapy had a very big difference. And if you think about it for a moment a really good cognitive therapist is probably fabolo-- you're gonna get fabulous outcomes from them. But a cognitive therapist whose not very good can probably be harmful. And so DBT-- one, one of DBT's characteristics is that there's very little difference between therapist who use them-- use it. 

02:09:00
17 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR DBT 9 Independent Sites â¢ 10 RCTs with DBT training and supervision â¢ RCTs Compared DBT to Alternative Manuals Linehan, Koons, Telch, Safer, van den Bosch, Verheul, Lynch, Bohus, McMain, Pisterello Carter "Tunrer", Clarkin" "no expert DBT supervision or adherence ratings 

02:09:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, there had been nine indi-- they're been 17, ah, there are more randomized trials I just have put them in their la-- there's been-- there's so many trials being done that but there's randomized trials at nine independent sites. 

02:09:15
Can others do the treatment? Yes. Are DBT gains due simply to expert psychotherapy? RCT: Internal Validity Trail â¢ Designed to Control For: - Therapist expertise and experience - Therapist gender - Therapist allegiance to treatment - Institutional prestige - Availability of supervision - Availability of affordable treatment - Assistance to connect with therapist - Hours of individual therapy - Non-specific factors 

02:09:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So can others do it? Yes. Are gains due to expert psychotherapy? No, we compared it to experts. So, it's not working because of gender, allegiance, prestige, supervision affordability, uhm, or non-specific factors. A lot of people said, you know, all ga-- all therapist are equal, it's not true. 

02:09:40
RCT: Internal Validity Trial Compared: DBT treatment vs. Control Treatment with Community Experts - Experts were: â¢ Elected by peers (other psychologists) as experts in their own treatment â¢ No behavioral therapists used in control treatment DBT compared to Expert Community Therapy â¢ Suicide attempts: 50%â©â¢ ER visits for suicidality: 53% â© â¢ Inpt. admits for suicidality: 73% â© - All remain 50% lower during follow-up Are DBT gains due simply to expert psychotherapy? No Does DBT work because it uses an expert suicide treatment protocol? Are DBT gains due simply to expert psychotherapy? No Does DBT work because it uses an expert suicide treatment protocol? 

02:09:40
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean I assume you probably know that too. Uhm, so now the answer is no. That means that you can do it by the way, you know, it really does me and we have people, you know, with, uhm, masters level, Ph.D, there was no difference in degree. By the way we look at to Ph.D is to better than masters level and they did by the way. But it turn out it had nothing to do with her degree and had to do it whether they had have behavior therapy training or not. And the people would had be-- all the people with behavior therapy training in their past had better outcomes in the people who didn't. Uhm, and we have one study where we show that people who-- were adherent to DBT had better outcomes with drug outcomes. 

02:10:25
Expert Suicide Treatment Protocols DBT (Medication Tapered) VS. Suicide Expert Therapist Team (Expert Medication â¢ Emotion-focused Dynamic Model) No significant differences between DBT and Control Shelly (McMain) 

02:10:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Now the other question know is maybe the real reason DBT works you don't really need DBT you need that suicide expertise of DBT. Okay. So that's the possibility. And, and so and we have really good so to-- suicide protocols so maybe you will be just affected on whatever you're doing with these groups but if you just put that protocol in. So the question is how likely is that to be the case? They did a study in, in Canada where they compared DBT to another treatment and the other treatment was, ah, ah, a psychodynamic emotion focus treatment plus, ah, really good pharmacotherapy but the people running the show were real experts in suicide so you had two treatments with really good expertise and the treatments work-- they run a equivalent cuz they-- you can test for equivalent but they weren't significantly different. It doesn't mean if-- when things aren't significantly different it doesn't mean they're equal, you have to do a really big study to find that out but it does say, maybe expertise is where accounts in suicide. 

02:11:35
DBT reduces reinforcement of suicidal crisis behaviors DBT: No correlation between # phone calls and # self-inflicted injuries TAU: SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION (p <.05) Does DBT work because it uses an expert suicide treatment protocol? It's possible! 

02:11:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Now there's some, uhm,-- in our treatment by experts of example, in DBT there's no correlation between phone calls and self-inflicted injury in another words you're not getting reinforce for suicidal behavior in DBT cuz we set the treatment up so it wouldn't do that. But in our control condition there was a significant correlation, the more you call, the more suicidal you were, the more suicidal you were the more you call it's not clear. But the more attempts since-- so you're not gonna call after you attempted. Uhm, so it's possible that it's working because it's an expert suicide treatment protocol there, ah, two other sta-- there's another really interesting study where they took in patients and they randomize when they left half of them to, ah, crisis clinic where you have a lot of expertise in a crisis clinic and suicidal and mental trained and experience or they continue to see the psychiatrist on the impatient unit and of course they figured continuing care with the psychiatrist will be for better but it fact it was significantly more suicidal behavior in that group than the group that got the expert. So, that's another thing that it could be just expertise and suicide itself is really far more important than any of you thought. So, that's the possibility so I suggest if you don't have a lot of training, don't have a good manual to really look at. You could look at the DBT suicide-- approach to suicide and see if that-- how well that would do. 

02:13:00
Are skills a key component in DBT treatment? Do DBT clients Use Skills? 3 completed RCTs - Compared standard DBT vs. 3 different control treatments - Women with BPD â¢ 5 assessment pints - each 4 months apart - included 1 follow-up time point (A. D. Neacsiu) Change In Use of Skillful Behavior Mean Skillful Behavior 2.00 1.90 1.80 1.70 1.60 1.50 1.40 DBT Control pre-treatment 4 months 6 months 12 months 16 months Time in Treatment Significant time by condition interaction - F(1, 90.85) = 26.41, p<.001 â¢ No condition only effect â¢ Significant time only effect - p<.001 

02:13:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, the next is, is maybe the real thing that's working in this treatment of skills. And you can put a lot of money on this one because there's a lot, a lot of data for this one. Okay, we've looked at, uhm,-- this is something where the line going up is in all of our studies the people who get DBT, ah, use more skills and we have a measure of that, yes. But it turns out that the people and all the other therapist they got better too, not as much but they do they start acting more skillfully also. But then, what you found is DBT kept getting better at follow up in the control condition which was treatment these were various other non-DBT treatments they loss their skills during follow-up. So this is really important in our studies to look whose teaching things that they get than into the person and not that they stay. 

02:13:55
Does skill use help explain DBT outcomes? (A. D. Neacsiu) Skillful Behavior and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Time Ã = -5.05* Ã = -1.92* Difficulties in Emotion Reg. Ã = 0.80* Used of Skillful Behavior Ã = -8.09* Use of skillful behavior partially counts for reduction in difficulties in emotion regulation. denotes p<0.05 (A. D. neacsiu) Ã = -3.07* Ã = -1.69* Ã = 0.80* Use of Skillful Behavior Use of skillful behavior partially accounts for reductions in interpersonal problems. 

02:13:55
MARSHA LINEHAN But-- and then, uhm, the outcomes of this when we say mediate what this means is people who improve their use of skills had fewer difficulties in emotional regulation following the improvement. People who improve- start using their skills had better interpersonal-- ah, solve interpersonal problems better after they learn the ski-- use the skills. And we had, I don't think I have it here but we have the same finding for self injury and for suicide attempts suggesting that if you can get a person who get a person to get more skillful the other behaviors go down, okay. 

02:14:35
Does skill use help explain DBT outcomes? Yes, skills are important. Does DBT Only Treat "Symptom"? Lorna Benjamen's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) Patient Introject Change Positive Negative Patient Appreciate and Value Self Increasing Appreciation and Value Patient Attack and Reject Self Decreasing Attacks and Rejection Patient Perception of Therapist using Coaching Strategies Increasing Supports / Achievement Patient Perception that Therapist Approaches them with Love and Concern Increasing Love / Concern Does DBT Only Treat "Symptoms"? No Is DBT only a treatment for BPD? DBT RCTs and Controlled Trials RCT ED 2 DBT Skills Only RCT MDD 3 DBT Skills Only RCT Forensic 1 DBT Skills Only RCT Emotio Dysregulation 1 DBT Skills Only Controlled Inpatient 3 Adapted DBT Controlled Forensic 2 Adapted DBT Controlled Juvenile 3 Adapted DBT Controlled Adolescents 2 Adapted DBT Outcomes for Axis I Disorders: Remitted 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 87% 68% 64% 47% s39% 355 Substance Dependence Disorders Major Depression Eating Disorders Panic Disorders Other Anxiety Disorders PTSD (Harned. Murrey, Co Linehan, 2005) DBT also improves: ï¿­ Eating disorders ï¿­ Substance abuse/dependence ï¿­ Other out-of-control behaviors ï¿­ Depression ï¿­ Emotion regulation ï¿­ Basic interpersonal relationships ï¿­ Self esteem (negative introject) Is DBT only a treatment for BPD No. Is DBT cost effective? Efficiency & Costs: DBT vs. TAU ? Cost for DBT is approximately 50% LOWER than treatment as usual DBT also has significantly FEWER: - Inpatient days - Deliberate self-injury - Emergency medical visits - Therapy drop out One Year Health Care Costs Per Patient DBT TAU Individual Psychotherapy $3,885 $2,915 Group Psychotherapy $1,514 $147 Day Treatment $11 $876 Emergency Room Visits $226 $569 Psychiatric Inpatient Day $2,612 $12,008 Total: 1 year $8,247 $16,586 Total per month $687 $1,382 (Linehan & Heard, 1999) 

02:14:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So jsut suggest, okay, skills look like they're important. Uhm, so we know that skills are important-- I think I'll skip this one to DBT only symptoms this is the psychodynamic criticism of DBT. Uhm, we said to the psychodynamic therapist give us a measure and if I can show I can change it you'll be fi-- you'll stop saying that. And meaningless to say we widely show later point so they had to, ah, stop saying it which I think they actually have. So, now as DBT treatment only for BPD these are-- ah, I'm gonna skip this too, I'm gonna skip this, I'm gonna go over to skills. DBT-- a lot of people think it's not cost effect, a lot of people say, "Oh, DBT is too hard to learn, it's not cost effect, is that your big thing?" But in reality it's very cost effect it's the cheapest treatment out there mainly because it keeps people out of hospitals. 

02:15:45
Comparative Costs Per Patient Total Per Month Dialectical Behavior Therapy $8,247 $687 Mentalization-based Therapy $27,014 $1,506 Schema-focused Therapy $22,742 $631 Transference-focused Therapy $24,534 $681 (Antoinette, Van Asselt, & Dirksen, 2008) Is DBT cost effective? Yes! Conclusions 1 both DBT Suicide Protocol and DBT Skills appear to be important. 2. DBT affects factors beyond just "symptoms" 3. DBT is rapidly expanding to treat multiple disorder 4. DBT is a cost effective treatment 

02:15:45
MARSHA LINEHAN It's not good there for people places where they want people in hospitals cuz they need the body is in the hospital, DBT is not their therapy. Uhm,-- so this one I'm gonna say, this my main thing I wanna say then I wanna take some questions. Uhm, it appears in DBT that both the suicide protocol and DBT skill seem very important. Therefore, if you don't wanna learn DBT-- it's certainly is reasonable a lot of people might know, I want you particularly if you're not a behavior therapist or don't like behavior therapy, I will suggest that you at least learn the suicide protocol and learn the skills. The-- there's the skills book out now that's pretty easy to follow that, uhm,-- although I wanna tell everybody to go get training which you'll, you know, all of the research is has people who been trained. So, I could say that but I will go to tell something else. My graduate students start and there at disaster at the beginning just to be clear. And I use to watch my students and I thought, "Oh, my gosh! I can't let them do this they're so terrible at it. They ca-- they don't even understand the skills. Dah-dah-dah." But I have found that, if they teach for whole year and I come back the next year and look at them it's quite amazing how good they get. Now, what they get is supervision so my suggestion is if you start doing skills try to find somebody who's had some sort of training for a little bit of supervision. But you could also just try it from the manual particularly if you're good teacher the key to skill trainings would be a good teacher. So, there's the skills, uhm, you can also get the main textbook for DBT. I have a conflict event just to be clear. I make money offer with my book. I make money offer training, I'm getting pay for this. And I have other conflicts which you can't remember right this minute. I own a company that, that makes computerized, ah, treatments but I don't think this is relevant to that. So, I make all source of money offer this treatment so you should take of grain and so of what I have to say. What we know is that DBT effects fi-- but the thing is that you don't wanna pay attention to day-- that data collected by other people there who don't have the conflicts. Uhm, DBT affects factors beyond just symptoms we know that. 

02:18:15
THANK YOU!!!!!! Conclusions 1. Both DBT Suicide Protocol and DBT Skills appear to be important. 2. DBT affects factors beyond just "symptoms" 3. DBT is rapidly expanding to treat multiple disorders 4. DBT is a cost effective treatment 

02:18:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, now so this is what I'm gonna say to you. In the-- first of all you have to decide most of you aren't DBT therapist already so the first thing you have to decide is whether you wanna learn it, okay? If you wanna learn it my suggestion would be that the first thing you do in before you go get training unless you certainly wanna learn that is that you, uhm, think about learning the skills, you can, uhm,-- DBT skills are everywhere on the internet, believe me they are they're everywhere. You can find the whole thing on the internet just look up DBT skills on the internet and all these k-- and these former clients they have fabulous I'm not kidding they are so, so creative. I love all the stuff they've done. And, you know,-- and like for showing my publisher just let him do it without getting angry for about copyright. So you could-- I was giving me grip do I say something wrong? I don't think so. So the one thing you can do just to get appeal for this is that you can go online and just look up DBT skills and you'll see you're get a good field for what a lot of them are, okay? And you can learn them because they took my videos and then transcribe my videos and use those as the teaching. And, ah,-- so, it's a lot us remain. You can also see me teaching probably not skills but teaching more on DBT by going to use two by looking me up. So, another words what you wanna do if you're interested is try to figure out do you wanna learn the treatment, and if so, do you wanna learn the whole thing or just part of it. Okay? Now, DBT skills training can be done in groups and it can easily be done in the individual therapy, okay? It could be done in schools. And when you do an individual therapy what you have to do is you have the skills, the base-- best way to do skills in individual therapy is to have the skills handout and worksheets in your office, if you think a client needs a partic-- you to practice all the skills first, you can't really teach a skill you can't do. So you first practice them, you have the stuff in your office. And then, if you think a client needs that you pull it out you give them one, you have one to yourself, you review it with him, you give my homework assignment and you tell them to practice another words. You know, skills are like learning to play tennis. You go to see the coach but, you know, the only time you play tennis is when you're in the coaching lesson is highly unlikely you're gonna win a tournament and go-- in, in tennis. And therapy is lot like getting people to win a tournament which is, ah, win over the disorders they have. So, that-- so it's very effective in an individual session, uhm, and I would suggest that if you don't wanna learn the whole therapy, the th-- the part of it-- they're two parts to look at, one is, uhm, skills and the other is the suicide risk assessment. Now, I get ask a lot to go to court for people who use my suicide risk assessment. And, ah, I tell them, I say, "You know, I cannot, ah, say anything for you if you haven't done the whole treatment. In other words if you have it you, you know,-- so you wanna be careful about merging treatments together, ah,-- but anyway look at that. So, what I view all of you all ask is, ah, particularly the people in the room who are, who are trained in DBT my view o f the field right now is that, ah, the government is not going fund. 

02:22:00
Conclusions 1. Both DBT Suicide Protocol and DBT Skills appear to be important. 2. DBT affects factors beyond just "symptoms" 3. DBT is rapidly expanding to treat multiple disorders 4. DBT is a cost effective treatment 

02:22:05
MARSHA LINEHAN We're not gonna have money to test which treatment are better. We have a treatment up in Canada that just came out on DBT skills who is six months compared to wait list and it was widely more successful, much less suicide attempts. So, if you're in area where you have a waiting and maybe that, that skills-- six months skills training is not sufficient but it's a whole lot better than waiting list. And most place is that I have DBT and the country, ah, in the world right now have six to eight months waiting list, I mean no one can get into DBT now because there's so many people wanting it. So, doing skills for people on wait list, uhm, ah, is proba-- you know, that was very effective, it has to be replicated but it's probably effective. Uhm, what we need now is people to look six months or one year important is make a DNA the year of therapy or six months of therapy. I don't think that, ah, we have one study, one group is gonna try to do a study on that but I the United States is not gonna fund so we're gonna count on the clinicians in the community to do this research which means that it's really-- the only thing that would have to cha-- I just wanna beg you to collect data on your interventions. You know, if you, if you have-- if you, if you have a specific intervention you're doing no matter what it is really as long as you can bright it out and say exactly what it is then look at your outcomes and see there's one treatment look better than another because we're gonna have to start counting on the clinicians in the community to find out what works and what doesn't but it can't be opinions so we're gonna need people to come up with ways to measure outcomes. And so, I'm looking to try to-- we're at the Linehan Institute we're trying to develop a, ah, data management system that people in the community could use that could, you know, you could do questioners and outcomes in things like that, ah, and that you will be able to use it. I don't know if you know this but there's actually very good clinical data by Jackie Persons P-E-R-S-O-N-S, showing that if you collect outcome data on clients and do a graph every week and show it to the client the client will have better outcomes in not doing that. So that in itself is a very effective strategy. And it's possible the reason DBT works cuz we do direct work. I mean that's the same idea we sho-- we look at the data everywhere so it's-- and we comment on at every way. So, you know, it's all together possible we have some very simple thing in this treatment that makes it work. So my suggestion to you is that you look at some of these things you look at tracking outcomes on irregular weekly basis whether clients like doing it or not. You look at a suicide protocol as an expert one. I think we-- we've certainly go more da-- way more data. We have four randomized trial showing DBT reduce suicidal behavior which is two trials more than the other and so another that has two trials but there's no other study does even got to replicate the study on suicide. So, if, you know, if you're interested in suicide where a good place to come. And, uhm,-- so skills, the records and that. And see if you can integrate in. If you figure out how to do this and you start having an experience that your therapy is going better with it I will love to hear about it. Because we're gonna have to start looking at all of this. Now, I would like to take, uhm, questions. Uhm, do all get feedback on these things? Do I, do I-- am I gonna find out whether you like this or not? 

02:25:55
[sil.] 

02:26:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I really like getting feedback because I like finding out, I like to be better, okay. But I'm gonna take questions now and there's many of you can stay as possible cuz sometimes our questions are really good and I do my best thinking with the question. Okay. 

02:26:20
UNKNOWN I have a question over here. 

02:26:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Where? 

02:26:20
UNKNOWN On the side over here. I'm working with the population that mentioned in couple of other sessions that have a condition that is so far not identified technically by the medical, it's not in the ICD codes, it's not in EDSM codes. 

02:26:35
MARSHA LINEHAN What is the condition? 

02:26:35
UNKNOWN It's called misophonia, it is, ah, people who have extreme neurological reactions to certain sounds and there is very little research on it and anyway at all but what little bit that there is, is indicating that perhaps a DBT is going to be very useful. So what I've been doing, ah, I had started with CBT but I-- after doing a lot of reading I started adding some of the things from DBT and I think it's has the potential of being, uhm, one of the more effective, ah, treatments it-- there is no protocol for this thing yet so people are trying whatever they can. Ah, I have a question about when you're listing the, you know, ah, skills training would an important thing if you don't wanna do a full blown what, what would be the elements. How important are the things it seems like you have this very-- ah, you have a lot of structure activities like the chain analysis in things like that. How important are those in really detailed structured things in your treatment management? 

02:27:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Well chain analysis is quite. You had to do a chain analysis if you wanna understand the cause of factors of the behavior. But the average person only has three to five chains in the first place and therefore-- wait a second. I want you to - 

02:28:00
UNKNOWN Bless you. 

02:28:00
MARSHA LINEHAN - know the three to five change, you don't have to do anymore chain analysis. You know, there's only reason you're doing the chain analysis you're on assessment. In assessment I would say 90% of therapy years or assessment years, or base on assessment years. And so you have to assess but people have completely misconstrued and thought that you have to do to chain analysis all the time once you're done. You have to do them to understand what's going on but once you understand you can say, "Is it this?" They'll say, "Yes", you said, "Okay." 

02:28:30
UNKNOWN Okay. So this particular condition-- the treatment is unlikely to change the neurology of the condition itself but, ah... 

02:28:40
MARSHA LINEHAN It probably meet radical acceptance among other that. 

02:28:40
UNKNOWN Well I'm-- yes I'm... 

02:28:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Mindfulness radically acceptance - 

02:28:45
UNKNOWN I'm, I'm using a mindful... 

02:28:45
MARSHA LINEHAN - emotion regulation. 

02:28:45
UNKNOWN I'm using, ah, ah, radical acceptance has been very helpful. 

02:28:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

02:28:50
UNKNOWN Ah, open h and - 

02:28:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

02:28:55
UNKNOWN - has been helpful. Uhm, some ma-- some of the other things that, that you talk about had been very helpful, uhm, I have a new tag line for what I do because of what you do that's... 

02:29:05
MARSHA LINEHAN So let me, so let me ask you if you have another question, if you have more question. 

02:29:10
UNKNOWN Now, ob-- I'll stop and that's good. Thank you very much. 

02:29:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Yeah. 

02:29:15
UNKNOWN So my questions a little similar to that, I work in community metal health which one of my staff is called kinda like working in the Mash Unit you know - 

02:29:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmm, yeah. 

02:29:25
UNKNOWN - you're kinda covered with blood all the time and I have said, ah, two of you-- of my staff that it seems like really focusing on the skills whether on the skills training and focusing on the skills can be as meaningful as doing what folks refer to as full blown, uhm, ah, DBT and I kinda wonder what thoughts are on that. 

02:29:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Well that's, ah, that's an empirical question we don't have that. You know, ours we-- no one is looked at skills training compared to standard DBT. 

02:29:55
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

02:29:55
MARSHA LINEHAN We don't have that, you know, ours we-- no one looked at, at skills training compared to standard DBT. There's certainly a lot of-- and the research, you know, e-- is probably gonna go in favor of standard DBT which doesn't mean a skill training alone is not important. 

02:30:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:30:05
MARSHA LINEHAN But you can't but we, we don't have any good reason to believe particularly with highly suicidal people of the standard DBT by itself. I mean that skills by itself is sufficient but it may turn out to be. It depends on how severe the people. You know at least in Seattle were tier so we have high tiered. The high tiered people is hard to I'd like-- I have a number of very severe people that couldn't possibly have it through skills only. Now, those are people were ACT, you know, Assertive Community Therapy they now have DBT ACT, DBT Assertive Community Therapy. So DBT Assertive Community Therapy might be very effective for some people and what we would have to look at now is how much, uhm,-- so it depend on who you've got but if you don't have resources obviously you're gonna do skills training but I can't tell you that there's data that is effective so you cant's-- it's not an evidence base treatment for - 

02:31:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:31:05
MARSHA LINEHAN - at least suicidal individuals. And it's unlikely to be an evidence base treatment for drug addicts. 

02:31:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. 

02:31:15
MARSHA LINEHAN But it's likely to be effective sort a lot of other things. And it's certainly effective for emotional regulation. 

02:31:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:31:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And we have research on that. It-- it's effective for emotional regulation anxiety and depression. We know. 

02:31:30
UNKNOWN Good. Thanks. 

02:31:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

02:31:30
UNKNOWN Dr. Linehan... 

02:31:35
MARSHA LINEHAN It's good thing you all speak up. Yeah. 

02:31:35
UNKNOWN Your comment about Borderline personality disorder having such stigma really touches me and I, you know, working for 30 years with a lot of population that maybe in that category. It seems that this is a population with chronic and pervasive abuse and trauma in their lives and I wonder what we can do is a profession to reduce the stigma. 

02:32:00
MARSHA LINEHAN The main thing to do is change the name. I mean frankly, You know, if you would called pervasive emotion dysregulation the stigma would probably go away. Part of the problem is this got his name that is where beyond words and, uhm, it's an, an unfathomable and I don't understand would anybody. And we cannot get to change primarily because a lot of people have published a lot using the name Borderline personality disorder and they don't want to give up their publications, you know. So, ah, the severe is unbelievably political so the trick is to join the group you were try to get the name change. We just imagine being called Borderline personality disorder. First of all personality disorder who-- I mean give me a break, who want's to think they have a personality disorder like your personalities disorder versus you've got problems with emotional regulation which we all know has use biological thing. So, I mean I fought this battle I've-- I'm-- I so far have not won. Thank you. 

02:33:05
UNKNOWN Dr. Linehan, uhm, you mentioned about, uhm,-- I wasn't sure if you were saying there was like a new module or ski-- a set of skill for specific for chemically dependent people. 

02:33:15
MARSHA LINEHAN You mean? 

02:33:15
UNKNOWN Like... 

02:33:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. That's right. 

02:33:20
UNKNOWN Okay. And it's, it's that the one of your books coming? 

02:33:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. It will be coming out, yeah. 

02:33:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Excellent. Thank you. 

02:33:20
MARSHA LINEHAN You're welcome. Yeah. 

02:33:25
UNKNOWN Any recommendations in how on DBT might be applied to treat in inmates where, uhm, at, uhm, elevated risk for suicide? 

02:33:35
MARSHA LINEHAN For what? 

02:33:35
UNKNOWN Suicide. Any, uhm, for inmates worth elevated risk for suicide. 

02:33:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, inmates. 

02:33:40
UNKNOWN Inmates. 

02:33:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, get in touch with, uhm, AndrÃ© Ivanoff in Columbia she has been, has been widely use in the prison system. I don't know that anyone look at the reduction suicide but my guess is they weren't have a reduction there as well as we have anywhere else. And AndrÃ© Ivanoff-- you can go on Linehan Institute and, ah, and look for her and get her-- get in touch with her, uhm, and she's in Columbia University and that's her specialty is DBT in the prison system. 

02:34:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:34:15
MARSHA LINEHAN A lot of people are using prison systems and it's, ah, it's use in all juvenile justice in Seat-- in Washington state. There's a requiring evidence base treatment in Washington state now. Okay, over here. 

02:34:25
UNKNOWN I'm wondering about interventions... 

02:34:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, you got to come up to the center. 

02:34:30
UNKNOWN I'm wondering about interventions for, uhm, kids with conduct problems in hyperactivity. 

02:34:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, I don't know any research on that. I know for conduct and stuff DB-- you know, conduct is got a really effective treatment, there's behavioral treatments are extremely effective so can't imagine why you would not do them instead of DBT. 

02:34:50
UNKNOWN Any specific suggestion on behavior - 

02:34:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, you know, I can't here can you - 

02:34:50
UNKNOWN - in spe... 

02:34:50
MARSHA LINEHAN - can you, can you get up closer and really talk loud? 

02:34:55
UNKNOWN Sorry. Any specific, uhm, suggestions behaviorally wise-- for behavioral interventions? 

02:35:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Behavioral interventions? 

02:35:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, cuz you just said that would be more effective. So, I'm wondering if you had any... 

02:35:05
MARSHA LINEHAN I'm forgetting the exact names on but the behaviors is have lot. I mean these word are very good cuz these kids is in conduct disorder. 

02:35:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:35:10
MARSHA LINEHAN This is their long suit. 

02:35:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:35:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you know, uhm, you know if you go on, ah, if you look at behavior therapy conduct disorder there are lot of them but they effective they're very good. 

02:35:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

02:35:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Yeah. 

02:35:25
UNKNOWN Dr. Linehan, could you, could you give some examples or a flavor of some of the suicide interventions that you use? 

02:35:35
MARSHA LINEHAN My suicide intervention that we use is that we, uhm, whenever, ah, suicide ide-- ideation goes up-- or there's any change whatsoever in suicidal ideation we immediately fe-- have to fill out a whole check the, the, the Linehan risk assessment of management protocol checklist so you merely have to do that. In the first session we do a really through, uhm, assessment of lifetime risk for suicide and risk for suicide depending on your-- kinda your-- your, your, uhm, profile or kind of person you are well it be high risk. We track, uhm, within-- ah, it's really a, a checklist approach we're, we're very careful. Every session we ask about suicide we never don't ask about it. Uhm, and, uhm, wa-- once we find out that person is suicidal we try to figure out was that controlling variable and other words what's the fo-- what is the causal factors and how the problem solve the causal factors. We do a lot of work on commitment not to kill themselves at least for short period of time. I mean we had one, you know, I can get a person say a year you might them say 15 minutes, we had one of our therapist who had there for 24 hours talk to our patient every 20 minutes because she couldn't get more than 20 minutes out of her. So we take phone calls, we, ah, refuse to take phone calls if you've already harm yourself, ah, so if you do something you can't call and if you don't do something you can so we do a lot of telephone coaching with suicidal clients. We get rid of lethal means. You know, we do most of standard things. The thing that really unique about DBT is the, uhm, that is, that is-- there's, uhm,-- it's not like you let your therapist decide what to do. Now, what's left up is decide whether they need-- and we don't hospitalized we very rare hospitalization and we know that there's no pharmacotherapy that's ever been shown to reduce suicides by anything. You know, and the only one that has was compared to another treatment that there's reason some people believe me actually increase things. So, it's possible that the only fun of the therapy use actually didn't work. Just wa-- didn't make things worse. So, you know, we don't try to use drugs and we do a lot of both crisis intervention and, ah, a lot of assessment of suicidal behavior. 

02:38:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:38:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

02:38:05
UNKNOWN Hi, uhm, my understanding is that you're not really doing DBT if you're not working in a team and I can certainly appreciate the utility of that but I'm wondering for those of us that don't have that luxury of working in a team... 

02:38:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Wait, you're talking so fast I can't hear you. 

02:38:15
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. Uhm, for those of us that don't have the luxury of working in a team. 

02:38:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So, why when you have the luxury of working in a team? 

02:38:25
UNKNOWN Well, I'm in-- sorry I'm working in a school board. 

02:38:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You're what? 

02:38:25
UNKNOWN I'm working at the school board. 

02:38:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You're what? 

02:38:30
UNKNOWN I work at the school board so I work... 

02:38:30
MARSHA LINEHAN At the school board? 

02:38:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, as in... 

02:38:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Is you-- wanna do a DBT at the school board? 

02:38:35
UNKNOWN I see a lot of, ah, I do a lot crisis management and there was high-- highly suicidal youth that come through. 

02:38:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, okay. So why can't you have team? 

02:38:45
UNKNOWN Well, I don't have access to the team that has DBT knowledge so I'm just wondering what, ah... 

02:38:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, you have to talk somebody into getting trade. 

02:38:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:38:50
MARSHA LINEHAN And then you, you could meet with amount of regular basis you can skipe with amount of regular basis. 

02:38:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:38:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you know, didn't have to be-- but I mean at, ah, good DBT people talk other people into it. 

02:39:00
UNKNOWN Great. So that, you would use that other person to the parent side of things. 

02:39:10
MARSHA LINEHAN What? 

02:39:10
UNKNOWN It's just hard to, ah, so you would use that other person to do the parent coaching while you... 

02:39:15
MARSHA LINEHAN No. No, you wouldn't do that you've got to hold different situation you're not doing this. You're not doing DBT adolescent treatment. So you wouldn't do that. 

02:39:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:39:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You ne-- you need to find-- where, where you live? 

02:39:25
UNKNOWN In Ca-- in Ottawa Canada. 

02:39:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Ottawa Ca-- Ca-- Canada is got a lot of DBT. Okay, so when you find anybody in Ottawa doing DBT and they could be doing a different DBT that you but they are in your team cuz they're job is to make you good on way you do and you just make them good. 

02:39:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:39:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So you could find other people who do it. 

02:39:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:39:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Or you can talk someone else in but they don't have to be doing it with you. You know, DBT didn't had to be a team treatment and has-- you have to have team that you can talk to about your behavior and what's in the way of making you the best therapist you could be. 

02:40:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

02:40:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Thank you for the question, gradually, that that straightened out. Okay. So are you gonna do it? Are you gonna do it or not? Yeah, okay, I got it. Let's see I have to go over here. 

02:40:15
UNKNOWN Yes, I'm just wondering about your thoughts or perhaps, ah, the research around whether DBT works with people who admit anti-social personality disorder and the... 

02:40:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, you know, we're analysis data and analyze social perso-- disorder-- personality disorder like this minute. And I-- our tentative findings are doesn't appear that they do any worst to anybody else in the treatment. 

02:40:40
UNKNOWN Thank you that's great. 

02:40:40
MARSHA LINEHAN That would be a shock if it's true. So you can't say that I said the-- I said this tentative analysis and we, you know, you have to do analysis a lot to be sure you didn't mess up somehow. Okay. Yes. 

02:40:50
UNKNOWN I'm nervous to actually talk to you right now because three years ago I said-- I was your events, uhm, I am nervous actually cuz I'm gonna tell you-- I'm confess something to you that... 

02:41:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Let me-- can talk into slowly you have that time. 

02:41:05
UNKNOWN I know it to some right, because you yield at me three years ago and you said, "You cannot call yourself a DBT therapist without the consultation group." I had... 

02:41:10
MARSHA LINEHAN That's true. 

02:41:10
UNKNOWN It's true. So I got the group. Fine, I did it but hurricane Sandy, uhm, led me to do a lot of texting. 

02:41:20
MARSHA LINEHAN What? 

02:41:25
UNKNOWN Texting. Texting that the-- but the texting... 

02:41:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You started texting who? 

02:41:25
UNKNOWN Oy! Okay, so I'm doing a lot of that, now my question is, I know it's not DBT but I use it and it's effective. 

02:41:30
MARSHA LINEHAN What is effective? 

02:41:35
UNKNOWN Texting and coaching my teenagers not when the suicide. 

02:41:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I like doing it all the time you tell me? 

02:41:35
UNKNOWN Okay. So it's legate. 

02:41:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Te-- teenage don't even like to talk on the phone. 

02:41:40
UNKNOWN They don't - 

02:41:40
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. This... 

02:41:40
UNKNOWN - there's no talking. I'm a texter so it's okay. 

02:41:40
MARSHA LINEHAN You know, all the adults love to talk on the phone and the teachers only want to text-- I mean teens only want to text. 

02:41:45
UNKNOWN They don't talk to me. 

02:41:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Well what's the problem with that? 

02:41:50
UNKNOWN Come on. Good, I feel better now. 

02:41:55
[sil.] 

02:42:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah.

UNKNOWN I am-- I, I work on, ah, County Crisis Line so we get a lot of phone calls for people that are suicidal and we only have a few minutes to work with over the phone. We're limited 10 to 15 minutes and each time they call, uhm,-- I mean I get the same councilor, uhm, we, we may never hear from them again, they may call a different crisis line. I'm just wondering if done any research into what is helpful in that type of environment where we're not really practicing therapy but we're keeping people from killing themselves in the moment. 

02:42:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, here's the deal catch me in the year because the VA wants me to come train their crisis people. And we, ah, mean another person, we're sitting down and saying, "Okay, if we want to train crisis people in DBT skills to help them with crisis what would we do?" and I said, "I have no idea." So we're gonna figure then now solve it and we're gonna listen to their calls even though I use to, I use to supervise a crisis line but I haven't been on them a long time. We're gonna go and I haven't develop my skills in so we're gonna kinda go with her skills and sit around and listen all the stuff going and, and maybe do some crisis cause ourselves and try to figure out how would you do this. And then when I figure that out I would tell you. 

02:43:15
UNKNOWN Great. Thank you. 

02:43:15
UNKNOWN I work with the Geriatric Population and a lot of times, you know, actually probably everyday I hear someone whose got multiple medical issues, chronic pain say, you know, I'm done. 

02:43:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. Yeah. 

02:43:30
UNKNOWN I'm done. I really would do anything rather than live another day. 

02:43:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

02:43:30
UNKNOWN It's the so... 

02:43:30
MARSHA LINEHAN I feel understandable, isn't it? 

02:43:35
UNKNOWN For me. 

02:43:35
MARSHA LINEHAN It's understandable too. 

02:43:35
UNKNOWN Yes. And so, uhm, in terms of the suicide protocol would you still utilized... 

02:43:45
MARSHA LINEHAN No. 

02:43:45
UNKNOWN No? 

02:43:45
MARSHA LINEHAN No I would-- you know, there I would, I would, you know, un-- unless you have reasonably they're going to kill themselves but giving that, ah, you know,-- well I don't know what state do you in. 

02:43:55
UNKNOWN What-- oh, California. 

02:43:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Do they have the right to suicide? 

02:43:55

02:44:05
UNKNOWN I know. 

02:44:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you know, the thing to do is, you know, I mean you have to assess whether they're likely to kill themselves - 

02:44:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:44:15
MARSHA LINEHAN - but the main thing you have to do is figure out how to make life worth living even though they're on all this pain. 

02:44:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:44:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And, and so with that kind of person, you know, you're not gonna be able to get them doing loads of productive activity so more than likely you have to work on meaning in life - 

02:44:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:44:30
MARSHA LINEHAN - work on, uhm, a volun-- you know, a things they can do for others that, that will give are people on their family or people that they know. So, you know, it's the sense of figuring out when has to changing your life to make it worth living with the pain - 

02:44:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:44:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Not, not having to get rid of the pain. 

02:44:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

02:44:45
MARSHA LINEHAN What makes it worth living with the pain. But, you know, it's understandable that order person with a lot of pain, I feel that way. 

02:44:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

02:44:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So you have to assess them. Do they-- are they just saying or they mean it -
