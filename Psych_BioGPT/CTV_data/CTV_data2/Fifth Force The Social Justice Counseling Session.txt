Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:00:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi, my name is Dr. Manivong J. Ratts, and I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling and School Psychology at Seattle University. Today what you're going to be doing is watching a video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy". We're going to be going over the major theoretical paradigms, if you will, or forces that have really shaped how counseling is practiced with clients. 

00:00:20
1st Force: Psychoanalytic 

00:00:20
2nd Force: Cognitive/Behavioral 

00:00:20
3rd Force: Existential/Humanistic 

00:00:20
4th Force: Multicultural 

00:00:20
5th Force: Social Justice 

00:00:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS We're going to look at the first force, which is the psychoanalytic tradion, the second force which is also referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. Then we'll highlight and provide an overview of the third force in counseling, which is the existential/humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology. Then we'll look at the fourth force in counseling which is referred to as the multicultural paradigm in the field. And then last but not least, we'll examine and look at social justice as the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. Within each of these particular theories or paradigms or forces, if you will, I'll be interviewing experts in the field. Each of these experts will be sharing and talking about their current research within that particular paradigm, as well as, some of the major tenets of the particular force that, uh, they are specializing in, in the particular field. So, I'll be interviewing  a psychoanalytic, uh, scholar. I'll be interviewing a C.B.T scholar, existential scholar, uh, multicultural oriented scholar. And then last but not least, uh, social justice oriented scholar who've really helped shaped each of those particular forces and made them what they are today. 

00:01:40
Psychoanalytic Scholar Ken King, M.D. Robert Janes M.D. Susan Radant, Ph.D. 

00:01:40
Cognitive/Behavioral Scholar Sam Song, Ph.D. 

00:01:40
Existential/Humanist Scholar Mark Scholl, Ph.D. 

00:01:40
Multicultural Scholar Cirecie West-Olatunji, Ph.D. Allen E. Ivey, Ed.D. Patricia Arredondo, Ed. D. Thomas Parham, Ph.D. 

00:01:40
Social Justice Scholar Judith A. Lewis, Ph.D. Rebecca Toporek, Ph.D. Hugh Crethar, Ph.D. 

00:01:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Following each of those particular interviews, what you'll see is a series of therapy sessions with the same client. The client will be working with five different therapists. Each therapist will be operating from a particular tradition, paradigm or force, if you will. The first therapist will be operating from a psychoanalytic tradition. The second therapist will be working from a C.B.T. perspective, cognitive/behavioral orientation. The third therapist will be operating from a existential/humanistic perspective in counseling. The fourth therapist will be working from a multicultural oriented perspective. And then last but not least, we have a demonstration of a therapist working from as social justice oriented perspective. 

00:02:25
Psychoanalytic Force: Sheri Hunt, M.D. 

00:02:25
Cognitive/Behavioral Force: Katherine Nordell Fort 

00:02:25
Existential/Humanistic Force: Steven Scheutz 

00:02:25
Multicultural Force: Agnes Kwong, Ph.D. 

00:02:25
Social Justice Force: Michael Hutchins, Ph.D. 

00:02:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS My hope is that by watching each of these particular videos, uh, or interviews if you will, as well as, each of these particular counseling sessions, it'll really highlight and provide you with some of the strengths and weaknesses of each particular counseling force that has really shaped how counseling is practiced to this day. Today what you're going to be doing is watching part of a larger video segment entitled, "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy". For this particular segment, what you will be watching is me interviewing some of the major social justice scholars that have really helped shape the social justice counseling movement, uh, today. I'll be interviewing Dr. Judith A. Lewis, Dr. Rebecca Toporek, as well as Dr. Hugh Crethar. 

00:03:20
Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy Part V: The Social Justice Force 

00:03:20
Judith A. Lewis, Ph.D. Governors State University Rebecca Toporek, Ph.D. San Francisco State University Hugh Crethar, Ph.D. Oklahoma Stat University 

00:03:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS Within this particular interview, they'll be highlighting some of the major, highlighting some of the major historical events and figures that have helped shape the social justice counseling perspective. They'll also be talking about some of the major tenets that, uh, within the social justice perspective in counseling and psychology. Last but not least, you'll hear them talk about some of the future developments that we can look forward to as it relates to social justice and counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:03:45
Michael Hutchins, Ph.D. Private Practice 

00:03:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Following this particular interview, you'll have an opportunity to watch a live demonstration of a counseling session. We'll be watching Dr. Michael Hutchins, who's a private practice counselor in Arizona, operationalized social justice tenets with his client. You'll have an opportunity to see him work with this particular client within the traditional office setting, providing micro level based counseling. Uh, you'll also have an opportunity to see him work outside of the traditional office setting, uh, implementing advocacy in his work with this particular client. 

00:04:25
Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:04:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy" where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition which is the first force in counseling. The second force is referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition. The third being the existential/humanistic tradition. The fourth, the multicultural counseling paradigm. And last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

5th Force: The Social Justice Paradigm Interview Judith A. Lewis, Ph.D., Rebecca Toporek, Ph.D., Hugh Crethar, Ph.D. 

00:05:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS  I'd like to begin by first thanking Dr. Judy Lewis, Dr. Rebecca Toporek and Dr. Hugh Crethar for coming here today to talk about social justice counseling as really the fifth force in the counseling field. Uh, I kind of view social justice as a new and emerging paradigm that's really having a significant influence in terms of how we can practice in a therapeutic room with clients. I want to begin by just asking each of you sort of what got you into the social justice movement in counseling, and sort of, uh, how did you get involved in this movement? And what about social justice resonates with each of you? 

00:06:10
REBECCA TOPOREK I can start. Professionally I got involved in multicultural counseling first. Ah, and in the process of understanding the whole process of multicultural counseling and my place in it as a person with numerous societal privileges, I started to recognize the overlay that social justice had. And for me as a white person particularly, uh, social justice was a necessary part of becoming a multicultural league competent. So, it sort of started that way, and also just practice experiences that I had where I really started to see clear injustice, that the intra-psychic approach to counseling wasn't adequate for a lot of the clients that I was working with. So, advocacy and social justice was really helpful in looking at how to shape the work that I could do more effectively. 

00:07:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, it's really, your sense of social justice and what got you involved is really sort of evolved from your own experience in terms of, with multiculturalism and, and, and clinical practice in that sense. You've seen some of the limitations of it, it sounds like. Okay. 

00:07:20
JUDY LEWIS I think what Rebecca for saying is really interesting, and I, I had a little bit different background in terms of this question. For me I was a social justice advocate first. And to me, the counseling profession is an excellent way to help make this a more just world. One of my, uh, earlier professional experiences was working in a school system in their first year of court-ordered desegregation. And that was a big eye-opener for me, because they brought us in as school community relations consultants, and the idea was that we would help the kids to get along better. But what I found was that working with the kids was so easy. They wanted to know each other so much. And everything that the adults did proved that they didn't want it to work. The parents, the administrators, the teachers. Everything in the environment worked against having these kids get along. A big learning experience for me. 

00:08:35
HUGH CRETHAR And Judy, what you're saying kind of, I guess, kind of ties into the part of it that's really drew me to look at counseling from a social justice perspective.  Uh, it's, I found early on that most of the theories weren't really focusing as well on context as they needed to. And, or at all in many cases. Uh, and, making assumptions that all problems were driven from individual choices and, and individual behavior. That it happened devoid of what was going on in society and what was in their environments and what was going on historically. All those things weren't really factors. And, it just didn't make sense to me. It didn't, it didn't fit into my, my lived experience and, and to the experiences of the people that I served. And so, I kind of came through the route that you were talking about, the multiculturalism. And, and what kind of kept me moving forward was the deep part of the, okay, so given that, what, how does, how does, how does it all apply actually with people and making a difference in their lives. And, and that's where, where the social justice part started to come to life for me. 

00:10:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, it sounds like for all of you it's really been the limitations with, with all of these different theories in psychology and counseling that have, the limitations that you saw in each of those theories that have really, uh, forced you to look at, uh, different ways to operate in practice, and really look at things from more of a contextual perspective, which I think multiculturalism allowed us to do. But, what you're saying is, is the field of psychology and counseling, it really hasn't been adequate enough in terms of being able to alter systems, and that's really what social justice is about and what has caused you to sort of, uh, put so much of your energies, if you will, within this particular movement. 

00:10:40
JUDY LEWIS  I think social justice counseling, the social justice paradigm has a lot in common with humanistic approach in that both are positive and look at human development as something that you want people to be able to control in their own lives. But, I think that the big difference between what makes social justice counseling different is that focus on the larger world, which means that you're helping your clients look at that larger world. You're helping your clients understand the impact of the environment on themselves. But also, you're looking at your own work as going beyond that office and talking with the client to a larger effort at advocacy so that it's all part of the same thing: talking with the client, talking with a group of clients, talking with a legislator, talking with the parent, talking with the Mayor. They're all part of the same effort. 

00:11:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS  That's interesting because it sounds like what you're saying is social justice counseling is really about helping clients understand their situation in context, helping them gain insight into their world from a larger perspective, and, and using advocacy as a means to help alter some of the environmental barriers that can be impacting or impeding their development. 

00:12:20
HUGH CRETHAR  I think that always speaks to something that's really different about what, what someone who works in this paradigm has to do. To do what you just described, you have to have an awareness of the kinds, multiple contexts of many peoples and how those, how, how the different, how they affect each other. Uh, so you can't help someone become aware of the political and social pressures and so forth in their lives if you're not aware of them yourself. You have to actually put in the work to understand other peoples' lives. And I think multiculturalism is what kind of got me moving in that direction, but I don't see it as like the context, because there's a lot of, there's more, more to context than just culture. 

00:13:05
REBECCA TOPOREK  I think one of the things in terms of, you know, my progression as I'm listening to both of you talk about advocacy and, uh, social justice. So, multiculturalism is kind of where I started. And I'm looking at communities and trying to understand communities as a way of becoming more multiculturally competent and then recognizing ecological aspects, and so using an ecological system or theory to really understand the multiple levels that might be going on. But then also looking at what could I actually do, you know, about all of this, and, and trying to have some idea of myself and how, how do I address some of these. So, I started doing what I now call "seat of my pants advocacy", which is I wasn't ever really trained. It wasn't until I was a counselor that I started to become an advocate and an activist. And so, I did what I thought needed to be done, and in reflection realized that I'm not sure I did it the best way possible. And that I feel like, uh, it would be helpful to have more written, more guidelines so that, so that the me who started when I was 22 is a counselor would've had a little bit more guidance about doing advocacy appropriately or doing social justice appropriately, specifically because I have so many aspects of privilege in my own background. So what I think you're saying, Hugh, in terms of understanding all of these contexts, I also think understanding where do I fit in into that context in terms of my privilege, my understanding, my worldview, all of those things, and how I act, uh, is influenced by those things. And I can use that in a positive way for the client and for addressing system, systemic change, uh, or I can perpetuate oppression and the status quo which is not in favor of the clients and the community. So, there's a balance I think of who I am and how I am positioned as well as where the clients are, as well as all those layers. 

00:15:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS All those different layers, which, which for you, when you talk about that, it's complex. It sounds like what you're both saying is it really needs to start with the counselor, the therapist, in terms of not only understanding themselves in terms of who they are and how does privilege play a part of their life and issues of power, but also, uh, how contextual factors influence what's going on in the therapeutic room. Something that you mentioned, Rebecca, that really resonates with me is, is we talk a lot about social justice in our field, but there's not really a guideline or framework out there in counseling and psychology that, that allows people to sort of have a framework to sort of, uh, implement social justice initiatives and agendas and, and perspectives, if you will. Uh, it seems like there's a lot written about what is social justice and how do you define it, and less of a concrete sort of framework. It seems sort of like that's more where we need to head in terms of in the field of counseling and psychology. 

00:16:25
JUDY LEWIS I think social justice counseling is radically different from everything that we normally think of as counseling. That's why I think it's worthy of being called a fifth force. It really is different, because in some ways we're working with clients in a way that's opposite of what the conventional wisdom says you're supposed to do. The conventional wisdom says you really have to have the client focus on what that client has control over rather than having the client feel helpless because he or she sees so much going on outside of himself that affects. And, what we're saying is that it's important for the client to look outside of himself or herself. And in a way it really is the opposite of what many of us were taught when we first got into the field. 

00:17:25
HUGH CRETHAR And adding to that, even when we have our, and other therapies will do this, where they'll have people go and do something in regards to their environment. We, we also argue that it's our job to actually get actively involved in, in that change too instead of just, you know, we have our 50 minute session or whatever, and then tell them, "Okay, now go do, go do the stuff we talked about." We also believe that we need to get involved in, in in the disequities in the world and, and, and not just kind of be the cheerleader once a week for a certain period of time. 

00:18:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS I think that's what I was getting at with what you were talking about was,  was if we're requiring or encouraging therapists and counselors and psychologists to do that, we need to be able to provide a framework in terms of how to be able to do that. It seems like psychology is, we're very good with helping people work with clients on an individual level but not necessarily on a systemic level. I want to go back a little bit and, and, and sort of ask you all, sort of, how did this movement come, come to fruition, the social justice movement. How did it evolve from your perspectives? 

00:18:40
JUDY LEWIS You know, one thing that I think we should be aware of is that even if there wasn't a framework, even if there wasn't a science, even if there wasn't a literature, that for allt he years that there have been counselors, there have been counselors who have been doing social justice work. School counselors who see the impact of, uh, bad curriculum and bad disciplinary procedures on kids and try to protect them the best they can. Uh, employment counselors and career counselors who see inequity and unfairness in hiring practices. There have always been counselors who have done this work, but it has been without their having been taught how to do this work when they were students. It's like, one thing that we had talked about before is that it's like, you know, the difference between a peoples' history versus the written history of a people. There's a peoples' history of counseling and the counseling profession. There's a peoples'  history of counselors and advocates and social justice workers that's different from the more formal history that you see in the books. 

00:20:05
HUGH CRETHAR It is, it's even how we look at the formal history. I mean, we look at people like Gilbert Wrenn and so forth. We can see that history playing out. It may, it's just how people choose to read the history, I guess, because to me it feels like when I look back at the history of counseling as a field, way back at the beginning of time, we were advocates  for change, at least in the career area, uh, for sure. And, I think that perhaps as the field develops some of us lost our way and, and lost some of that. And I think it's more being revived and now honed better. 

00:20:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, it's not really a, a new theory or, or emerging force. It's, it's something that's always, it sounds like you both are saying has been a part of our history from the very beginning. 

00:20:55
HUGH CRETHAR Yeah, but it's becoming more formalized. I think we're getting a lot more, you know, there's being a lot more done about it now. People did it, but I think it's becoming a lot more a movement now. 

00:21:05
JUDY LEWIS I think that's why we got involved in creating the advocacy competencies because we knew from a lot of peoples' experiences that there are ways to connect your counseling work and your advocacy work. And, I think Rebecca speaks to that really well. She's always been involved in doing research on advocacy since, since the beginning. 

00:21:35
REBECCA TOPOREK Well, I was just thinking with your question about how did it evolve, I have this  image of different sort of roots coming together, because whether it's in school counseling or career and employment counseling, or in family therapy and, uh, in a lot of different places, uh, social justice, like Judy was saying, really was, was acted out, but I don't think it was, uh, formalized, as Hugh said. You know, it wasn't written down in a way. Training programs didn't directly talk about it. And so, uh, I think one of the things that was really nice, and I don't know if this is the appropriate time to talk about the advocacy competencies, but I think it did, uh, sort of help to formalize and bring together some ideas about the, how do you work at an individual level. What does that look like? How do you work at a community level, and what does that look like? And then, how do you work at a, a larger scale, whether it's societal or a policy level to, to do something that is counseling , uh, and to use the skills and the talents and the training and the scope of what counselors do, but to address some of those larger, uh, external issues that are really a part of the problem, you know, addressing the problem as opposed to addressing the individual as the problem. Uh, and, and so I think the advocacy competencies is kind of a way, drawing on all of those evolutionary forces and kind of bringing them together. So, I think when you look at those competencies, they are informed by a lot of different, uh, historical influences within the profession, but also I think recognizing the contribution of other disciplines is important too. 

00:23:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS It certainly has, the competencies have certainly provided a framework to sort of improvement social justice initiatives. I agree. And, it seems like people, we have a language to call, to use to call what we do now, whereas before people were, it sounds like what you are all saying is, have always been doing social justice work in, in the field but just didn't have a language around that to describe that. Just real quickly, because I do want to talk more about the advocacy competencies, just from, from you if you could just sort of share a little bit about who you feel have been the major figures in sort of the evolution of the social justice movement, and/or major events that have taken shape that have, whether in counseling or in society in general, that have, uh, had a major impact in terms of the evolution of this particular paradigm in counseling and psychology. 

00:24:15
JUDY LEWIS I think the feminist movement was very important. It was important to me. I was, I was in one of those consciousness raising groups where we talked about the personal as political, and that was very meaningful to me, but it's not anything that anybody was talking about in terms of counseling at that time. 

00:24:35
HUGH CRETHAR And I think one of the better Jung's theories, newer theories that we have has come out of that movement, you know, relational cultural therapy I think has, uh, really been one of the, one of the strong theories that represents some of the, some of the principles in, in the social justice movement. I'll give one example. Just, uh, the difference in defining, uh, what mental wellness is. They wouldn't have really used that language, but instead of it being self esteem, it will be self in relation, so it's more about the relationships you have, the health of those and how you define yourself through your relationships instead of just how you feel about yourself despite everyone else. And that's just a really different way of thinking. And, I'm not saying that theory is responsible for that so much as it's one of the, one of the key variables. 

00:25:35
REBECCA TOPOREK I think in looking historically, there are, there are a lot of figures in history that, that get identified as part of the history of counseling, like Frank Parsons obviously in career counseling and employment counseling. But, a number of other people. I know for myself one of the things that I, I clearly remember this, reading an article by Isaac Prilleltensky   as saying, "O my gosh. This is exactly what I've been thinking." And so, I just remember the joy of finding people who were writing things, the community counseling book, Ellen McWhirter's work on empowerment, uh, was really exciting because it was proof that there were people there that were thinking and, and doing this and talking about it academically. But also, talking about what does that look like as a framework as opposed to just trying to address problems as I see them, but actually having a way of seeing things, uh, that could be really useful. And, it was valid. I mean, that was the hardest thing for me, was feeling like this wasn't validated through some of my training. And so finding, sort of, whether they work, uh, people were historically involved in doing this work or people who were contemporary and doing this work, that that I think is really meaningful. 

00:26:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS  It sounds like you are also saying, "I don't feel alone in this. There is other people that are like me and think like me, so I don't feel like I'm alone. And, maybe I'm not going crazy." 

00:27:10
REBECCA TOPOREK Which is such a great parallel to social justice counseling because I think that's part of what we do, is we work with clients to say, "Yeah, no, you're not crazy. This is actually not fair." Like, let's take a look at who else is doing work to make this more fair. 

00:27:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS And perhaps your reaction is actually normal. It's the environment that's sort of crazy, and you are responding in a healthy way. Yeah. In terms of key concepts in, in theories and constructs in the field, uh, what would you say those are as it relates to social justice counseling as the fifth force? He talked about the advocacy competencies. 

00:27:50
HUGH CRETHAR I think the, the issues that come out of that is certainly one of, one of the key constructs that everyone refers to when referring to social justice. I think also, uh, part of it is, uh, looking at well, you're going to do advocacy work, but looking at what are you doing advocacy work about and why. And I think that goes down to other issues of, of understanding the difference between equity and equality and understanding that equitable, equitable access and, and equitable participation are important variables in the context that a person experiences. And, uh, along with that, you mentioned Ellen's work on empowerment, and I think, uh, some, some of the constructs within her definition in that work were really important to, to talk about the importance of, uh, if a client is to become empowered, a person is to become empowered they need to realize that they need to find people to lock arms with like we were talking about, people to have as allies. And, uh, perhaps even to see that some people that you might be competing for what little piece of the pie society is allowing you are actually the people you should be aligning with against those who are limiting your access. 

00:29:15
JUDY LEWIS I think the key concept is that people develop within environments, and the environments can be very nurturing, and the environments can put up barriers. And our job in working with the clients is to try to find a way to find nurturing environments, take environments that are around them and make some more nurturing and find ways around or over or under or somehow to get past those barriers. So, at the same time that we're helping clients and students understand that, we are also recognizing that sometimes the student or the client is going to need us to help because in some situations we may have more power. 

00:30:00
REBECCA TOPOREK  I think in terms of key concept's, uh, the advocacy competency model has some of them embedded in it, and if so I just wanted to highlight that. I think that one of the things that you were talking about, Judy, that is an important part of that model is the advocacy with the client, in collaboration or partnership with the client, but then also advocacy on behalf of of the client. And so in the situations where, uh, we may have a certain position or access in a way that the client is not able to have access, justify our virtue of position in organization or whatever, uh, that those are two distinctions I guess. But then also, empowerment as you mentioned, Hugh, and advocacy at the individual level, community collaboration I think is a really key construct that when it's described from a position of social justice and at this he is different then when you talk about community collaboration in other contexts. So, at, at to the group or community level, the school level, uh, you have community collaboration when you are talking about advocacy with a client group. If you're talking about a group advocacy on behalf of a group, then that would be, uh, systems advocacy. And then, at a much larger level you have the construct of, uh, in the model it's called public information, but it's basically working on a large scale with client communities around the issue to educate the public, but also work together about what, what is a strategy that we can use to address this issue that's affecting a lot of people. And then on behalf of, but may also actually include clients, would be social and political, uh, advocacy in terms of legislation or policy. And so, those constructs, I think, are important to highlight because that is unique, I think, to other forces, the other forces may not include kind of that broad, uh, you know, we talked about ecological levels, but this really kind of nails down some key constructs within each of those levels, and then what would with that look like, uh, to actually do that with clients, uh, in concert with clients or on behalf of clients, still being directed by clients, but it, but functioning in a slightly different way. 

00:32:35
JUDY LEWIS In hearing Rebecca talk about the advocacy competencies, one of the things I'm remembering is how surprised a lot of people were that when we designed the advocacy competencies, we had an important piece of it that was about how we worked directly with clients. That the way an advocacy oriented counselor works with a client is different from the way other people work with clients. Maybe we were surprised ourselves when we had that piece of it. And I think the reason that people were surprised was that they think of counseling and advocacy as separate. And we've always thought from the beginning as part of the social justice paradigm, the idea is that it all starts with the client. That's why counselors are so good at social justice advocacy, because we are among the first to see problems that are affecting so many people because we learn from our clients, and then we start to look outward, and here's a client who's had a particular kind of problem. We can say it came from the environment. And then we look and find that same problem at that school or at at that community has been affecting lots of other people as well. And then you are on your way. 

00:34:00
HUGH CRETHAR I think you have another, a really big difference is, uh, having less of a remediation perspective and more of a prevention perspective in our work in, in that instead of just fixing those problems, just like you just described, we are also looking at how can we perhaps work on, work on the system and on the structure so that the problems aren't, won't be the same for the next person that comes along and so forth. And that prevention mind set is built into art individual work. That's, that's how the whole empowerment piece works is, you know, if, if they get to a point where , where they become more empowered, they, they're less likely to have those problems repeat or have something else crop up. I, I think it's just an entire mindset away from just fixing that which is broken,  or that which is bad, whatever, but also making it so that something else might not happen again. 

00:35:00
JUDY LEWIS I just want to say that we really do not see the problem as within the client. And that's a key concept here. 

00:35:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, it sounds like some of the things you're talking about  is empowerment, equity, uh, looking at things more systemically, intervening in the system as well as individually, looking at things from a micro, meso, and macro level, uh, perspective. How is it different, social just counseling as a paradigm, how is it different than social work? 

00:35:35
REBECCA TOPOREK That's a great, great question. 

00:35:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Cuz, it sounds like what you're saying is counselors need to expand their understanding of, of client development and, and some of the barriers impeding their developments, uh, and if it's the system then counselors should, and psychologists should intervene in the system. Isn't that like social work. 

00:35:55
REBECCA TOPOREK That's exactly what one of my professors said do to me in my doctoral program, which, which energized me to actually talk about how it's relevant in counseling. Uh, and so, just briefly I'll say what I said at that point, which is the clients that I have don't have a whole staff of mental health professionals to turn to. They have me, and so, uh, I can refer them elsewhere, but that's doing a disservice. That's actually an ethical issue in my mind, that I have this person that I'm working with, and so, and they're facing these other needs. So, I think it's really interesting, because that's a criticism that comes up often, and there are so many places where I think social workers get excellent training in terms of looking at systems, in terms of intervening in systems, uh, but I, I don't know that, uh, there is a unique history that counseling has in terms of focusing on development, of focus on strength based, a number of things, the vocational aspect, which is really strong within counseling, and, and not so much in, in various trainings in social work, that I think is a, is a valid and important place for advocacy to be, given what counseling is a profession. 

00:37:20
JUDY LEWIS  I shrugged when you first asked that about isn't it that social work, but then it made me really think. I hadn't really thought through this. So, this is a great learning experience for me. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Those forces are more important than the particular professional identity that differentiates among the different job titles. I think that they are within the helping professions, a number of people who are social justice advocates. I mean, if anything were very close to community psychologists. So, there are people who are social justice advocates, and people who are, adhere to different models. But, I think they tend to cut across. I think they tend to cut across the professions and to be more important then the professional titles. 

00:38:20
HUGH CRETHAR I think you hit on another key factor when I think about people, those, those in our circles that, that focus on this. We tended to value interdisciplinary work and to value multiple perspectives instead of looking, looking at things more as a turf. And, and that seems to be a pretty consistent construct across a lot of people I work with, at least that come from this space. 

00:38:45
REBECCA TOPOREK And I think the other, the other response that I have a lot of times is, "These problems are really huge. Like, to expect that one profession is going to be able to address all the inequities in societies is very unrealistic" and I think is self-serving to some extent. And so I think that the emphasis on collaboration that comes up in terms of social justice and advocacy, like you were saying, going across disciplines, having people contribute what they know, they're training from their particular view and profession's worldview, and to being able to did look at problems from a varieties of ways and bringing our strengths together with clients, client groups is I think really useful. So, the, the work that's been done in prevention adds a lot to the work that we do, public health adds a lot to what we do. Social work does a lot. Law. I mean, there are so many professions, as you said, Judy, where there are are social justice advocates. And, I've learned a lot from especially students that come from other fields and to come into counseling and, uh, community organizing. I love getting students from community organizing. And sometimes what they say is, "We've been able to really do a lot at the community level, but I feel like there's some, we're not attending to what's going on with individuals. I want to get the counseling training so I can bring those two things together." So I think, I think kind of the patterns that we see, like you were saying, Judy, is, is really useful. And our ability to reach out to other disciplines and to accept them when they are reaching out to us is important and those, those definitions of who does what and who is allowed to do what, I think is, is if I were suspicious, I would say that would be a way of not actually addressing the big problems that are there. 

00:40:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS  Well, it sounds like a lot of what you were all saying is, is we need to move away from turf wars, uh, and, and, and when clients come in, they're not really wanting to know what is our title, but more so our concern about can you help me get to the root of my problem. Can you help me alleviate some of these issues I'm dealing with on an everyday basis. And what you're also saying is how do we draw the best from different fields, uh, and collaborate with each other to be able to help clients get the services that they may need, which is a lot different than the other counseling forces in the field. I'm wondering, what do you see as the role of the counselor who operates from the social justice framework? 

00:41:30
REBECCA TOPOREK I think one the role is collaborator, uh, because I think one of the things that's important in looking at doing social justice counseling is being really cognizant of our role. And so, if we work a little bit as collaborator with the client, then I think there's more of a chance that the direction that it goes in can be directed really by the client. Keeping in mind the cultural issues around what our expected roles of help givers and being respectful of understanding that. 

00:42:10
HUGH CRETHAR So, if I piece together what you just said in my mind. I was trying to think of an answer. Like, a culturally intentional collaborative change agent. 

00:42:15
REBECCA TOPOREK  That sounds good. 

00:42:20
HUGH CRETHAR That's kind of like if I pieced it together, that's kind of it, because you're working at the individual and broader levels doing that. 

00:42:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS  What techniques are there in this particular paradigm, if you will? You talked about the advocacy competencies for example as a framework to implement social justice initiatives or perspectives, uh, and to address issues of inequity that might be impeding on clients' development. But, what would you say are techniques in order to, uh, operate from this framework? Does that make sense? 

00:42:55
JUDY LEWIS I'm trying to think of they, I don't think I usually think of that so much as techniques as I think of it as kind of a framework for, a framework for helping the clients or students that we're there to help. And I found that in, uh, one of the things that I've worked on over the years is the community counseling model. And, that to me is important because it, uh, it sort of operationalizes in the same way as the advocacy competencies do, because what I'm looking at is how you work directly with the clients and with the community and with the larger systems, and how you work on behalf of the individuals, the community and the larger systems. And I think originally it was set up kind of as an administrative , uh, as an administrative apparatus. So that, say if you had an agency, you would have all those pieces as part of it. But, I think of it more now as a counselor's role in that counselors have to do a lot of these pieces that other counselors can get away with not doing. I mean, the reality is that as a social justice counselor, a lot of the stuff that you do you don't get paid for. It's like, it's what happens on the weekends and, you know, if you are a therapist in private practice as a social justice counselor, you know, you're like one or two. And so what happens is that yes, they make their living on the part of what they are doing which is working directly with, with the client by the hour. But, look at all the other things that they do on behalf of that client that's just part of what they do so they can do a better job. But, they can't bill the insurance company for it. 

00:45:15
HUGH CRETHAR I've found in the last few years and my work, and then feedback I get from students when I teach this, this and what they do in practice, is something that has kind of become kind of a technique, but I never really called that. But, actually they call it back to me, they go, "Oh, I've used that." They call it the empowerment technique, and I never called it that. But, basically there are kind of like five basic steps that come out of Ellen McWhirter 's work that kind of take you through a process of enabling a person to become more empowered. We don't really give people empowerment so much, but helping them to work through that process. And, you know, we talked about the first step already, you know, that, you know, having the awareness of the forces around you that affect you, and then going into being able to take some control over, uh, portions of that within your context. And then looking to ally with other people who have similar struggles or comparable struggles and lock arms. Two, uh, the next step is doing, doing that without stepping on someone else or pushing someone else down. And the final step of that is, you know, you're not, I would say you're not really truly empowered if you, you forget where you came from. And so that last part is what are you doing to help others along now that you are, you're in a better space. And that kind of five-step thing, kind of serves as a template, like you were saying, but when working directly with someone in session even. And, to me it serves, I guess, as a technique in a way. I, I never really called that until my students started calling it and saying, "Well, I, I was using your empowerment technique." I said, A, it's not mine and B, I'm not sure it's a technique. But, I can see where you're coming from. 

00:47:15
REBECCA TOPOREK I think the nice thing is that there, there are a variety of techniques. There are a variety of approaches, uh, so, so this is one. And, a colleague and I, Bob Chope have a chapter on career counseling from a social justice perspective. And we have five or six, I think, six steps in that. And I think there are a lot of different contributions to doing this advocacy competency test on very specific strategies in there. If I were to try to distill down what the components would be in practice, I think one of them would be having the clear assessment with the client about what they identify as being the issues that they are facing, both internally and externally and in relation and all of that. So, really having an idea of that. And having some ideas of, uh, what the goals might be then at that point. I think in some cases there is some very specific issues coming up like, let's say, harassment within the school. Well, if that's the issue that's coming up, then that might entail a different approach then sort of daily micro-aggressions that happen that somebody is really trying to deal with. And so that might be slightly different in terms of how it is. I think the other aspect that's important is agency and working with the client to, uh, defined ways of having more agency, having a sense of agency. There's a great chapter in Etiony Alderando's edited book, the chapter is by Lewis, a different Lewis. But, it talks about, it's a reflection on one of his clients taking action, sort of, what is seemingly is unrelated to the issue she brings it the counseling, but, it's, it's a means of this client really coming to appreciate and help and to feel some empowerment around helping homeless people, which actually tied in with what her clinical issue was, which was abandonment, but not homelessness. And so, there are these parallels. So I think, I think there are a lot of different techniques, but I think there are some principles that kind of, uh, run across a lot of different techniques. And some of that is the collaboration with the client like I said, agency and finding ways of addressing external barriers, really validating those external barriers, I mean, validating the existence of them and then looking at ways of actually addressing them, whether it's the counselor themselves in concert with the client or, uh, or the client themselves. 

00:49:50
JUDY LEWIS  I think that we have the technique that is our own as social justice counselors, and that is when we are working with the client we need to draw from that client ideas about what the client sees as having an impact on him or her from the environment. And that's something that even should be part of the assessment. The way we conceptualize, I don't want to see a case, because when they say case conceptualization I, I don't like to call the people cases. But, conceptualization of what the issues are that are affecting this client is very different if you're looking at it from a broad perspective. You know, if you're looking from a wide angle lens instead of the microscope. 

00:50:45
HUGH CRETHAR What you're describing to me is, talks about our, our clientele are experts on their own lives and experiences. And how it's not our job to take a top-down stance in construction of goals. That we do that, and I know others talk about this, but I really think this is something I stand strong on, that we co-construct our goals. We don't do the goals forever. 

00:51:05
JUDY LEWIS We do have to help the client draw this out because people aren't accustomed to be allowed to talk about that. 

00:51:15
HUGH CRETHAR That's, when I hear the word "co-" in there, that's the part where it's not, you just, you don't, I've heard some people, some students say, "Well, I just take the goals from whatever the client says she or he wants to do." 

00:51:25
JUDY LEWIS Then I write them. 

00:51:25
HUGH CRETHAR  And then I just write down what they said. And I go, "Well, that's not quite it, because you have to do what you just described." You have to obviously pull them to a space where they have to really think about it at a deeper level and, and come up with a real goal that they want to work on. And then come up with some way to actually measure that there's change happening. 

00:51:45
JUDY LEWIS And it's not just goals. With some clients you have to work really hard to get them to find something good and positive about themselves that makes their life worth saving. 

00:51:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS  So it sounds like you're saying it's really a strength-based, the therapeutic relationship is one that's collaborative and egalitarian. The therapist or psychologist or counselor isn't necessarily the one who is the expert in the client's life. But that the client is, and, and the therapist is really the facilitator in the process of helping them understand their situation. 

00:52:20
HUGH CRETHAR That goes back to a language that Rebecca was using in the collaborative. It's a very collaborative relationship. 

00:52:25
REBECCA TOPOREK You know, this, I'm reminded of a conversation I had last August when I was going, starting back to classes and feeling like, "I'm teaching all these counseling classes again, and I've been doing all this advocacy talking and social justice talking." And I was having a hard time reconciling how I had all these students who were entering because they liked the individual relationships, and I was going to be telling them that actually it needs to be broader. And so, I was talking with my coeditor of the "Journal for Social Action in Counseling and Psychology", Todd Sloan, and I was hasing him how, how does he view the process of counseling, whether it's traditional or the other forces, uh, or social justice counseling. How does he view that in terms of social justice. And he said something that was really profound to me. It was really helpful actually for me. He said, "Sometimes I think that what we're doing is working with somebody who's gone through so much that they're note able to actively participate in change, in social change in their life or in the larger democracy". Uh, and so sometimes we're working with somebody to help them gather the strength back up, uh, to maybe, whether it's to find their assets, find their strengths, but also heal enough so that they can be really active participants in a way that they may not be able to when they first come in. And that was really helpful for me, because it helped me, I've been sort of really working at, there's the external and of there's the internal, and there, there are issues at both levels. You know, it's not to say that every individual ought to blame their environment for everything. You know, there's some way in that assessment process, that co-construction process of looking at, okay, what parts of it are things that we're looking at the outside. What parts of it might I shift the way that I'm interacting with my family, with my community, whatever. There's, there's like a dance almost, a collaborative dance that they may do to figure out how all these pieces are fitting together and how, how can they have the strength to take agency in, in the ways that are meaningful and important to them but also the larger community. 

00:54:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS If sounds like what you're describing is, is a very value laden process, which is counter to how counselors have been traditionally trained in terms of needing to be neutral. And, and what you're saying is, is maybe that's not the effect, the most effective way to work with clients. 

00:55:10
REBECCA TOPOREK I honestly have to jump in there, because I think that counseling is not value neutral. I don't think it ever has been. I think what, what some different approaches, qualitative research is a great example. I think it's bringing value to the surface and saying, okay, we acknowledge that there, there are value systems in place. So if I were to say the value system in social justice counseling its equity. It's that people should have access to basic rights, basic survival, basic participation. And, there are ways in which my values, it's a value for wellness really. Individual, community, family wellness, uh, and it's how I see that being the way to get there may be slightly different then a different force, but I think every force has its set of values and assumptions and expectations. 

00:56:05
JUDY LEWIS Having these, having these opportunities for helping development available, doesn't that seem like a human right that no one should miss? 

00:56:20
HUGH CRETHAR I think that brings us in a way to that the ethic, ethical undertones of this whole thing, that ultimately I, I believe we all share a view that it's an ethical imperative to work from this model or something akin to it. Uh, because ultimately if you're not, then you're basically placing all, all the blame for all, everything on the individual when, when it's not actually realistic. 

00:56:55
REBECCA TOPOREK That's actually how, when I talked about early in my career really finding social justice and advocacy as an approach, it was in part out of feeling like I was not practicing ethically, that by only addressing these individual problems within the individual, that I was actually potentially doing harm because there were all these other factors that I was not able to take into account adequately, and I don't feel like, I didn't feel like I had the skills really to do that. And so, I was limited in terms of, uh, how I could really work with clients. In that limitation, I think, there's danger of the, not practicing those basic ethical principles, you know, uh, beneficence, non-maleficence, especially those, uh, even voracity and fidelity and looking at autonomy as one thing that I think is where social justice has been criticized, but I actually think it's a really important principle within social justice counseling in terms of what we've been talking about a lot in terms of collaboration with the client, what the client's autonomy, uh, is their decisions. I think that also brings up challenges sometimes when we might feel like something systemic needs to be addressed, and the client feels really strongly that that's not someplace they want to go right now for fear of repercussion or, or any of those things. And I think one of the things that we need to do as a field is to, to really grapple with some of these challenges of, you know, how do we pursue a, a path with the client in a way that's going to be in the best interest of the client, given all of these really tricky parameters that are out there. Even things like when we are working at the community level. What does informed consent look like? It's not just in individual. Fortunately, in community counseling and prevention, there has been some written in that. But, it is a different way of framing those kinds of ethical questions that I think would really be valuable to, to develop more. 

00:59:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS He talked a lot about benefits for clients in terms of operating from a social justice paradigm. What are the benefits for counselors and therapists and psychologists who operate from this particular model or framework, if you will? 

00:59:30
JUDY LEWIS  I think you learn about the world, and I think you gain courage. You know, I, I think that we have to be careful that we don't get just so into this is our theory that we use with other people, but that to be effective social justice counselors I think we have to have social justice work in our own personal lives as well. That we have to find the courage, and it does take courage. We have to find the courage or how our clients going to? 

01:00:10
HUGH CRETHAR I have to agree with that. I, in the past few years I have come to, uh, actively seek experiences of cognitive dissonance where, in other words what I'm saying is I, I, instead of running away from those uncomfortable times when I'm wrong, I kind of embrace it. It's like, if that, it's, that scariness of being wrong all this time about something is, on the other side of that is the rush of actually being much more right than you were before. And so, I'll actually seek out information from multiple sources and from people I think I might not agree with and whatever because I want to go through that discomfort. I want to, I, my best friends are my friends who call me out on accidental errors in language use for instance. And I, I appreciate that. I'd rather grow, and I think that's, that's what I'm getting from what you're saying. I think it's kind of exciting, because you are always learning and growing. 

01:01:20
REBECCA TOPOREK I will say that's what the benefit that I've personally have gotten is that it feels like I've grown, in terms of personal insight and relationships, but also in terms of skills, uh, because there's a wide range of skills. And when, uh, when I look at the building blocks that we have within counseling training of group dynamics, of looking at really listening and understanding and being able to hold disparate concepts at the same time. And then expand that to some of the other skills that are needed at the different levels, that's been really exciting and useful for me. And at the same time, I always need to question what's my motivation for being involved in advocacy and social justice with every client, just as with any other theory, you call it countertransference or any other theory really needs to look at that aspect, and I think it's the same, uh, with any social justice counseling. The other aspect, uh, that does, that I think is important to talk about is the, the pragmatics of this practice. Janet Helms had a great article in 2003 about the pragmatics of social justice counseling, and some of the things she talked about were the, you know, managed care and medicalized system and, you know, what, what gets reimbursed. And while, one of the struggles for me was the idea of service. The way that I was brought up was that this is a service, but I have to acknowledge that that's actually, I can't function very long that way. That somehow the system has to be changed in such a way that actually the wholeness of health is included, and that the job of counselors, the job of health professionals in general looks up that whole, that wholeness, because I think that's where students and practitioners have difficulty. They may be very committed, but in terms of paying the rent, uh, it's, it's difficult to figure out how to make that happen. 

01:03:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS It sounds like you're talking that this is one of the limitations of the social counseling justice perspective. 

01:03:30
REBECCA TOPOREK No. I would say challenge. 

01:03:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS  Or challenge. 

01:03:35
REBECCA TOPOREK I wouldn't say limitation. 

01:03:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. What's, what would other challenges be in, in terms of four counselors who want to operate in this paradigm beyond what you just discussed? 

01:03:45
HUGH CRETHAR I would build off that a little bit. I think we really need to look at how, how much we have moved to embrace the medical model and, and as a field. And how we really need to reevaluate that, and, and, and look more from a wellness model and look for prevention. And, uh, maybe, maybe find ways to redefine how we make a living doing what we do. Maybe that's the same thing you were saying, but I think it's a key variable. 

01:04:15
JUDY LEWIS I think were coming into a good time though. I mean, there was a time, maybe it was about ten years ago, it seemed like I was fearing for the helping professions because I would see so many students who thought that nothing was as important as knowing the DSM, I guess it was the III at the time or the IV. It was nothing, nothing seemed as important as being able to identify what the category was for that particular person. And there was a lot of pride in, uh, diagnosis as the center of your being. And I think that we've gotten, I think we've gotten quite a ways past that. 

01:05:00
HUGH CRETHAR We still have to fight against movements to have one prescribed response to a given diagnosis, which is a movement that seems to be happening in parts of our field. And I, I think that that's going to be an ongoing challenge. And I think it's being pushed by payers. And I think that ultimately the HMO, HMO/PPO world and all that has been pushing that to a certain degree. But, we are also, many of us, embracing that without even really discussing it. I think that's, that's a challenge that we really need to work on. 

01:05:30
JUDY LEWIS So, what we're talking about is the extreme challenges of being not social justice counselors. Look how much trouble you get into. 

01:05:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS  What you see as the future of the social counseling justice perspective? Where do you see it going in the future? 

01:05:50
REBECCA TOPOREK Well, I'll say one of the things that I see for future is related to challenges. Like other fields, other perspectives other, uh, waves. The ethical issues, I think we have to get much more complex in terms of our thinking about ethics in relation to social justice counseling as well as any other type of counseling. But, I think that social justice counseling actually has some really good thinking to add to that, that not only would influence what we call social justice counseling but also other counseling. I'm not sure how, how it could persist as being good counseling without being social justice counseling, but that's a different issue. But I think some of it is also really looking at some of the ways that, like for example, participatory action research and other types of research strategies that can be really useful for counseling in terms of thinking about how to really work collaboratively with communities and with clients to, to advance the way that we understand issues and problems, to even advance the way we understand how to act, how to be, how to be counselors and advocates and activists. So I think, those are some of the things for the future. I think there's so much more that could be written. I think there's a lots of great stuff that has been written historically, but also especially I think the last ten years. There's been more that's labeled itself social justice anyway. 

01:07:15
JUDY LEWIS And I think we're going through a, we are going through a process that's kind of like what we went through with, say with the multicultural competencies. And that is that the realization that multicultural competencies were important. At the same time you had to notice that the people who were teaching and supervising counselors were people who never had been taught those competencies themselves. So, we had to, you know, get through some sort of many generations in order to get to a place where there was, there was a decent number of people who were really building their professional work around those competencies. And I think that we are moving in that direction. I think we've, I think we've had a lot of movement. 

01:08:10
HUGH CRETHAR I think it reflects back to even the way that the multicultural movement has been changing too and developing, I think that the social justice movement has even impacted it. You look at all of the work that's being done on micro regressions for example and, and how we don't just talk about them and have an awareness about them, but actually are moving towards bringing, uh, work on experiencing micro regression into our therapeutic work. And I think that that's just an example of kind of how things are, it's, it's integrating. It's, it's, I, I think, uh, if we do what we should do, it should just become the norm in all counseling. There's not going to be social justice counseling. It's just counseling that has this bend, this wave has rolled over it and changed it. 

01:09:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Last question. What is a recommendation that you would give for a, an emerging counselor or graduate student who is interested in operating from this paradigm? What's something that you would recommend for them that would help them emerge into a social justice advocate, if you will? 

01:09:20
JUDY LEWIS I think they should find some people in their own communities to work with as people. And to find some opportunities for advocacy work in their own lives so they have a better sense of it before they are trying to teach it or collaborate about it with their clients. 

01:09:45
HUGH CRETHAR I couldn't agree more. I think of the service learning approach to social justice is probably the most powerful. Try, we as educators should try and embed it in our classes where people have those experiences and help them, help them have them themselves. And also they should go out and seek them, maybe as groups or on their own or  however. But, go do it. When you, once you get out there, your changed.

REBECCA TOPOREK And I think also finding mentors in the community, whether they are other counselors or people in other disciplines to learn from each other. And also, I really appreciated what you said, Hugh, about having people around you who will make you aware of things that you maybe haven't been expanded to. Which I also really resonate with it because that was really really important in developing myself as an activist in terms of having people around who could say, "You know, I wonder about the way you just said that, and how that might come across to somebody else." Or watching people who actually take risks and are activists and, and really addressing whatever fears that I might have about standing out or dealing with my own socialization as a woman, but also just within my family about speaking out and being assertive. Not just assertive, but actually standing up against something that could be, could have negative consequences and finding people and watching how they do that. And also really learning from them, I think, is really important. Fortunately, there are some really good things written as well. We have in the "Journal for Social Action" several issues ago had a series of narratives from counselors and psychologists/activists talking about how did they develop as activists. And I think that was, that's really nice for me to read because it helps me get an idea, number one, that not everyone body develops in the same way. I mean, I like the way our conversational. Because it really speaks to how people come to this work differently, uh, and the different things that impact them. So, I think reading about it, but also developing those relationship's of people that you can trust and watch and learn from, as well as be allies with, is really important. A couple of other resources, we talked about people as resources, but also in terms of some of the other things that have been written that I would really recommend is, there was a special issue in "The Journal of Counseling and Development", a special section,  five articles. One that's an overview of the advocacy competencies model. That's the most comprehensive discussion I think of the model right there. And then that's followed by four other articles looking at the individual level and the community level and societal level and then a couple of kind of wrap up articles. So that I really recommend. There's also the edited the volume of "Advocacy Competencies" that you were the lead editor on, which I think is also really valuable and important. It looks at different settings, different populations and how different people apply the advocacy competencies to different types of counseling situations in counseling people. There are also a number of handbooks, "The Handbook for Social Justice" that I had the pleasure of editing has some good things. I mentioned one edited by Etiony Aldorando which I think is really useful. Courtland Lee also has an edited one that I think is really useful. Those are just some, some. It's exciting because there's more. "The Community Counseling" book, Judy, that you worked on, I think, is really really important for people to also look at because it gives a framework that's I think really critical and integrated into social justice. 

01:13:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS And it sounds like what you're saying is there's a lot of literature out there that hasn't existed in the past that can really help inform students. So that way even an emerging counselor, so that way when they go out in the field they'll have a solid theoretical foundation of, of what it looks like and how to sort of operate from this paradigm. Well, I just want to thank each of you for taking the time out of your day to talk about real your passion and how you live out social justice every day. And, and to really help us gain a better understanding of social justice counseling as the fifth force in the field.

Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

01:16:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy" where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that have really shaped counseling as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition which is the first force in counseling. The second force is referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition. The third being the existential/humanistic tradition. The fourth, the multicultural counseling paradigm. And last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. 

01:17:20
5th Force: The Social Justice Approach to Psychotherapy Michael Hutchins, Ph.D., Private Practice 

01:17:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Hi, Annie. What brings you in today. 

01:17:25
ANNIE Hi. Uh, my friend did, actually. 

01:17:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So what's going on that your friend said you should be here. 

01:17:35
ANNIE Well, I haven't been going to classes, uh, for the last month. So I guess she was concerned, so she went to my house, you know, and made me come. 

01:17:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Haven't been going to classes. Tell me what that's about. 

01:17:55
ANNIE Uh, well, originally I went, I went to class and we started, I started school, because originally it was, the intent was so that I could find a better job to help he finance at home. My husband lost his job two years ago, and so I, we thought that, you know, if we go to school, if I go to school then I can help out, get a job, you know, that pays the better and help out with the finances at home and learn some marketable skills. Uh, but then last year he was able to find a job, and so we're pretty okay now with finances. Uh, you know, so I don't need to go anymore. So, yeah. 

01:18:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Don't need to go anymore. What's that like for you? 

01:18:55
ANNIE It's fine. You know, cuz I don't, I, I don't need to go. 

01:19:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS What would you like to do? You say you don't need to go. What would you like to be doing? 

01:19:10
ANNIE I would like to continue. So. 

01:19:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS It sounds like there's more going on here than I don't need to go. Can you tell me more about what's going on at home? 

01:19:35
ANNIE Well, uh, well things are fine now, but for a while my husband and I were arguing a lot about me not going to school. 

01:19:55
MICHAEL HUTCHINS About school? 

01:19:55
ANNIE Yeah. Uh, but now it's okay. So, it was kind of, you know, contentious, but it's okay now. 

01:20:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Help me translate. What does okay mean? 

01:20:10
ANNIE It's back to normal. 

01:20:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS When you talk about things being normal, okay. If you tied in some kind of core feeling with that, what would the feeling be? 

01:20:30
ANNIE I guess bored. 

01:20:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. 

01:20:40
ANNIE Yeah, a little bored. I think that's the first word that would come into my head. 

01:20:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So bored is the first one that comes in? 

01:20:50
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:20:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Historically, what do you do when you're bored? 

01:20:55
ANNIE I distract myself. 

01:21:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay, so behaviorally you distract yourself. That's, that's the thing you do. The feeling is boredom. What are you thinking at that point? 

01:21:20
ANNIE Well, I'm trying not to think about it. 

01:21:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. 

01:21:25
ANNIE So, that's why I distract myself. 

01:21:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, if I were in your house, who would I see during the day? I was this fly on the wall, who would I see? 

01:21:45
ANNIE It's just me during the day. 

01:21:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, bored, distracted looks like what? 

01:22:00
ANNIE Uh, I watch a lot of TV. I clean. That's it. 

01:22:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. What's your partner doing? 

01:22:15
ANNIE He's at work. 

01:22:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS He's at work? 

01:22:15
ANNIE Mm-hmm. 

01:22:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, he's working. You're staying at home being bored and distracted. What's the missing piece here? It seems like there's something that's not there. 

01:22:35
ANNIE I guess I would like to not be bored. 

01:22:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. When are you not bored? What kinds of things happen for you when you're not bored? 

01:22:50
ANNIE I'm not bored when I'm in school. So, being around that, I guess. 

01:23:00
MICHAEL HUTCHINS What were you studying? 

01:23:00
ANNIE Well, I haven't decided yet, but, uh, you know, I'm taking English classes and history classes. 

01:23:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Which of those is the most exciting? 

01:23:10
ANNIE It's hard to choose, because they're so similar. I would say the most exciting would be English. 

01:23:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So, if I were your English teacher and you were in my class, what kind of person would I see? 

01:23:35
ANNIE A typical student. I don't know. Just a student. I'd just be a student. 

01:23:40
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Did you notice what you just did? 

01:23:45
ANNIE No. 

01:23:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS You sat up. You smiled. 

01:23:45
ANNIE Did I? 

01:23:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Yeah. When you started talking about going to school, you, your whole body changed. 

01:23:55
ANNIE I guess I did. 

01:24:00
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Yeah. How do we capture that woman with that smile and that energy? What has to happen for that to become a part of who you are? 

01:24:15
ANNIE Go back to school. 

01:24:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So if you think about that's where my energy is, what would it take for you to start to make the steps to go back? 

01:24:40
ANNIE Well, it's not really my choice. 

01:24:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Tell me more about that. 

01:24:50
ANNIE Well, my husband and I talked about it, and it just makes sense for me to not go back. 

01:24:55
MICHAEL HUTCHINS When you say you and your husband talked about it, can you tell me more about what that talking about it looked like? 

01:25:05
ANNIE Well, him talking about it more than me talking about it. 

01:25:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, it was him telling you or? 

01:25:15
ANNIE No. No. I mean, I tried to say, I try to get my point out too, but he talks most of the time during conversations. 

01:25:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Tell me more about him. 

01:25:35
ANNIE Uh, when I was 19, uh, you know, he's a year older than I am, and we got married young. And, you know, we thought that, we think that now would be a good time to start a family. And we wanted to do it a couple of years earlier, but because of finances we couldn't. 

01:26:00
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. Were you born in this country? 

01:26:00
ANNIE No. 

01:26:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Was he? 

01:26:05
ANNIE Yes. 

01:26:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Is any of what's going on tied into any kinds of cultural kinds of things? 

01:26:15
ANNIE I mean, I guess, cuz, traditionally it's, the woman stays at home. Yeah. And, and, you know, the woman takes care of the family and the kids. And the husband goes out and works. And he earns the money. So. 

01:26:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS When you talk about that, what are the feelings that happen for you? 

01:26:45
ANNIE It makes sense. 

01:26:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS That's the intellectual head part. That's how I think. How does it feel? 

01:27:00
ANNIE I think that it used to be I'm okay with it. I mean, I guess since going to school it's, you know, I'm not as okay with it, whatever that looks like. I don't know. I mean. 

01:27:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Not as okay. If you were free to do whatever you wanted to do, what would that look like? 

01:27:45
ANNIE What do you mean by free? 

01:27:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Uh, you had someone who said, "I will support you doing whatever it is you want to do." Whether that's your husband, your family. What would that look like? 

01:28:10
ANNIE I'd go back to class. 

01:28:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Is there anyone in your family who would support you doing that? 

01:28:25
[sil.] 

01:28:25
ANNIE I don't think so. 

01:28:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS What do you think would prevent your family from saying, "Yeah, Annie, go for it." 

01:28:40
ANNIE Well, you know, I guess timing. You know, because and age. I think if I started college right after high school, it would have been okay to do that. You know, but I didn't go after high school. And so I missed that chance. And the place where I'm at right now biologically it's time for me to have kids right now. 

01:29:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So you have how many children? 

01:29:15
ANNIE We have none yet. 

01:29:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. 

01:29:20
ANNIE Yeah, we wanted to start it even earlier, a couple of years earlier, but financially it wasn't really... 

01:29:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Right. So, we haven't had the finances. It would have been okay for me right after high school. What would happen if there was a way to find out if the finances could be there? 

01:29:45
ANNIE Well, the finances right now are okay, which is why I don't need to go to school. 

01:29:55
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay, okay. 

01:30:00
ANNIE So, it's, so the finances are okay now to start a family. 

01:30:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, it's okay for you to not go further because there's financial stability to start the family? 

01:30:20
ANNIE Yes. 

01:30:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS And when you talk about going to school your whole body lights up. 

01:30:30
ANNIE I guess it did. 

01:30:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Yeah. So, I'm seeing some real dissonance with that. 

01:30:40
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:30:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS If you were, if your husband were to see you light up the way you just did, what do you think his response would be? 

01:31:05
ANNIE I don't think it matters. 

01:31:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS You don't think it matters? 

01:31:10
ANNIE I mean I tried talking to him about school work. Uh, you know, what I do and the people I hang out with, but he just doesn't seem to want to hear it. So. 

01:31:20
ANNIE What does he do? 

01:31:25
ANNIE He's in IT. 

01:31:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS He's an? 

01:31:25
ANNIE IT. 

01:31:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS IT. Okay. How did he get to do that? 

01:31:30
ANNIE By going to college. 

01:31:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. When he talks about college, what does he talk about? 

01:31:35
ANNIE I don't know. It's, he was never really, he just saw it as a way of getting a job. 

01:31:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Right. 

01:31:50
ANNIE And, it just mean he had to do. 

01:31:55
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So he saw it as something he had to do. 

01:32:00
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:32:00
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. If we could spend time with him talking about improvement in the quality of life for both of you if you went further, do you think he would listen to that? 

01:32:25
ANNIE But isn't that, isn't that just the two of us? Isn't that, isn't that just the two of us though, you know? There's a future family. 

01:32:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Right. And what's the possibility that the future family would even be better off if you spent the time developing what you're excited about? 

01:32:55
ANNIE I don't see the point in that. I mean, I can't talk to my kids about my English classes when they're babies, you know. 

01:33:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Right. 

01:33:15
ANNIE So there's, there's no point. 

01:33:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS When you think about the future family, what's your vision of what that looks like? 

01:33:25
ANNIE Uh, well two kids, no, three kids, two boys and a girl. 

01:33:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Two boys and a girl. Okay. And when they're adolescents and young adults, what would you like to see happening for them? 

01:33:45
ANNIE They do well in school, you know. Just be happy. 

01:33:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS And how is the best way to teach them that? 

01:34:00
ANNIE By being there for them. 

01:34:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Being someone who's happy. 

01:34:10
ANNIE Being there for them. I mean, if I go to school, you know, and, I can't, we can't do both. 

01:34:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Are you sure? 

01:34:20
ANNIE I can't, I won't be able to be a good student and be a mom and a wife. It's too much. 

01:34:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Where did you get the information it's too much? 

01:34:35
ANNIE Well, cuz school is hard. And having kids is hard. 

01:34:40
MICHAEL HUTCHINS How were you doing when you were in school? 

01:34:45
ANNIE I was okay. I wasn't bad. Better than I thought. 

01:34:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Were you better than you thought? 

01:34:55
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:34:55
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So do you give yourself credit for having the resources to having the resilience to be able to do things? 

01:35:10
ANNIE I can do some things, right. I can, I can be a good student. And I know I can be a good parent too, but I don't think I can do both. And, he doesn't want me to do both. And he's right. It's gonna be hard. And what if, you know, what if something happens to my kid when I'm in class, and I'm not there. It would be, it would be, it's very hard. 

01:35:40
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Lots of what if's. How did you get to be where you are today? 

01:35:50
ANNIE I don't know. I sort of... 

01:36:00
MICHAEL HUTCHINS You graduated from high school? 

01:36:05
ANNIE Yes. 

01:36:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Did what? 

01:36:05
ANNIE In terms, what do you mean? 

01:36:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Did, I mean, were a good student? 

01:36:10
ANNIE I was okay. 

01:36:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. If you were in my classes in high school, what kind of kid, young woman would I have seen? 

01:36:15
ANNIE You know, I was kind of quiet. Didn't talk much. My grades were okay. I don't know. 

01:36:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS And then you started your community college? 

01:36:25
ANNIE No, I went, I went to a four year college for a semester, but I dropped out. 

01:36:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS You dropped out how far into the program? 

01:36:35
ANNIE My first semester. 

01:36:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Were you, and you liked it there? 

01:36:40
ANNIE No, I hated it. 

01:36:40
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay, so you lit up before when you said you liked English classes. 

01:36:45
ANNIE Right. 

01:36:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. And now the "I hated it" part. I'm not sure what that's about. 

01:36:55
ANNIE I think, well, back then, you know, I was, I was taking a lot of, I don't know why, but I was a Bio major. 

01:37:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. I was a biology major too once, but... 

01:37:10
ANNIE Yeah, why? So, it was a lot of bio, chem and calc classes. 

01:37:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. 

01:37:20
ANNIE I was no good at that. So. 

01:37:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS How did you get into doing that? 

01:37:25
ANNIE I think that was the only, one of the only fields that seemed good enough, you know, or, or has a better long term success or prestige. 

01:37:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Where did that information come from the belief of that? 

01:38:00
ANNIE I guess, parent, my parents. And, cuz you know, in any Chinese family, uh, parents, they want their kids to be lawyers or doctors and so forth. You know, and I always did okay in biology class in high school and math classes. 

01:38:20
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So is some of this about cultural expectations about what you're supposed to do and not do? 

01:38:30
ANNIE Yeah, I guess so. 

01:38:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, you're caught in that place where you have to balance what parental expectations, husband's expectations and then what is it you want? 

01:39:00
ANNIE Different from what they want. 

01:39:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Yeah, yeah. Is there anyone who would say to you, "It's really important what you want." 

01:39:20
ANNIE Uh, my friend, Lauren. She brought me here. 

01:39:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS She's the one who brought you here. I was gonna say, yup, that was my next step. 

01:39:30
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:39:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So she sees that there's more for you. 

01:39:40
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:39:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS What do you think there is that she sees? 

01:39:55
ANNIE She sees me in class. We go out after class with other classmates and talk about things. So. 

01:40:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, in some ways, Lauren is a big advocate for you. She believes in you. 

01:40:20
ANNIE I guess. 

01:40:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Are you ready to explore the possibility that she sees some things that you aren't seeing right now? 

01:40:40
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:40:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS I'm thinking that it may be helpful to get some more information about just how hard is it to go to school. Just what kinds of resources may be there. Not to diminish that taking this step would be difficult, but there may be some options that you haven't seen. 

01:41:25
ANNIE I don't think it matters. 

01:41:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS To whom? 

01:41:35
ANNIE To my husband. So. 

01:41:40
MICHAEL HUTCHINS What would happen if it matters to you? 

01:41:50
ANNIE I think what matters to me isn't what's best for the family. And I can't do what I want, cuz it's not just me. 

01:42:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So it sounds like you're making this decision alone. What would happen if we started bringing in your husband in this process and some information from the school so that you're not doing this all by yourself? 

01:42:30
ANNIE I don't think he would come. 

01:42:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS That's probably accurate. But, I'm suspecting that maybe if we got more information. For example, if we went to the school, the diversity office at the school, and got information about what programs were available, maybe daycare kinds of things. Uh, maybe resources for married students. I'm not exactly sure what's there, but it might be helpful to get some of that information. 

01:43:10
ANNIE You do that kind of stuff? 

01:43:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS We can do that. I'll tell you what. I've got some connections at the school in the Diversity Office. I'm willing to talk with them and see if we can set up an appointment for the two of us to go there and just get some information. If you're willing to look at the information that's out there and look at things that might be of interest to you. And we won't start with inviting your husband to come with us, but maybe after we've got some information we can talk about ways to involve him so that he doesn't think that you're going behind his back or something like that. 

01:44:05
ANNIE I'll go first. 

01:44:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So, if you look at the information on line or the catalogs, I'll make the phone calls, and we'll set up  our next appointment at the Diversity Center? 

01:44:25
ANNIE Okay. 

01:44:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. 

01:44:30
Advocacy Counseling Demonstration 

01:44:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS I have talked with them. They're going to give us information about all the programs that are here. I'm gonna just kind of step back and let you talk with them and get information that you need. And then we can talk after that. 

01:44:50
ANNIE Okay. 

01:44:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Hi, I called. I'm Michael. I have an appointment for, uh, my student and I to get some information. 

01:44:55
CARMA You must be Annie then, right? 

01:45:00
ANNIE Yes. 

01:45:00
CARMA All right. Great, nice to meet you. 

01:45:00
ANNIE Nice to meet you. And you are? 

01:45:00
CARMA I'm Carma(ph). 

01:45:00
ANNIE Carma, nice to meet you. 

01:45:05
CARMA I talked to you before, and so I'll be talking with you today. I'll hook you up with some resources of what you're looking for, right? So, let's go into the lounge and talk a little bit more. Make yourself comfortable, and I'll be there in a minute. 

01:45:15
CARMA I'm glad you guys were able to come in and that we have a little free time to meet. Uh, Michael was telling me a little bit about what your situation is, but before I can tell you exactly what we might have to offer you, I'd like to hear a little bit more or kind of get a refresher. So, what's going on? 

01:45:25
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Do you want me to share some information or do you want to speak with her first? 

01:45:30
ANNIE Uh, I guess you can. 

01:45:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. She's considering dropping out of school and is looking at are there any kinds of groups that could be supportive of her if she does in fact stay in school. Is that accurate? 

01:46:00
ANNIE Mm-hmm. 

01:46:00
CARMA Then you've definitely come to the right place. So, kind of the goal of our office and offices like ours is to make sure that you can get engaged in community that can support you. And, depending on the ways that you want to get involved, there is lots of different options. So, here's a little bit of information that you can take with you so you can look it over later. There' a zine that some of the students in the area made about what their experience is developing community, uh, and you can always participate in making those. And, there's a lot of different student groups. Uh, are you interested in kind of like meeting people more, talking, uh, taking actions? Do you know what kind of? 

01:46:40
ANNIE I don't really know. I'm not really, besides going to class I don't really hang out much on campus. So, I don't even know what it offers. 

01:46:50
ANNIE You kind of commute in then? 

01:46:50
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:46:50
CARMA So then I know who to hook, connect you with and what kind of services would fit you best, could you tell me a little bit more about what's going on with you and what you're looking for? 

01:47:00
ANNIE I don't really know what I'm looking for. Uh, I'm a student here, and, uh, you know, I have a family at home. So, I can't spend that much time here. But, I don't really know what's here. 

01:47:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS One of the things that we had talked about is helping her get some information so that she can make a decision, and if she decides to come back to school, what kind of support can this office provide for her. And maybe, you know, I could even work with you on some of that. But is, she's really questioning what kinds of things we can support her with. 

01:47:45
CARMA Okay. That, that clears it up a little bit. So, thank you for sharing a little bit what you had there. So there's, not only is there groups, uh, like for example just recently a group of Asian-American women got together and decided that they had a lot of issues other people couldn't understand, and they wanted to support each other. So, they started a group that meets weekly at different times throughout the week. Uh, and if there's ever an interest that you have, it's pretty easy to connect with people and start up a group like that. And we can support you in, uh, we support the groups, and we support lots of different groups that are ethnic or, like, feminist groups or gender identity based groups that, uh, can collaborate and find common grounds. So you can get involved with lots of different groups and just find support. Also, we have three counselors and directors of different divisions here in our office that you can meet with whenever you need to. We can set up appointments, so if maybe your peers aren't giving you some of the resources that you need, we have folks that know what's in the community, know who to talk to and we can set up appointments with them. 

01:48:55
ANNIE Okay. 

01:48:55
MICHAEL HUTCHINS So, so there, one of the things that could happen is as you're trying to figure out some of the things that we had talked about, there are counselors here as well that might be able to give you some specific information about programs here on campus. 

01:49:20
CARMA Yeah, we, like, everybody here is set up and really invested in wanting to make sure that you can succeed at school here. You know, it's a lot harder for returning students, for students of color, for parents, for you know, it's, it can be a lot harder and take a lot bigger decision to make sometimes. But, we're here to support you, and you've got peers that are going through the same thing. You're not alone. And, finding that community will probably be a great step in the direction of wanting to be here and feel solid here. 

01:49:50
ANNIE Oh, I guess, my, one of my questions is, you know, I'm an older student, so I wouldn't want to be, uh, in a club. Or I would feel out of place with a club or a group that's primarily undergraduates. And that's, that's one of my concerns. 

01:50:05
CARMA Okay, well, on the bright side, it's actually a pretty mixed bag when it comes to students, because everybody comes together for different reasons, and they're all coming from different places, so there's graduate students and undergraduate. Some groups even have staff and faculty that will join them because we're all people too, and we need that support as well. And we're all learning community together, so, uh, there will be probably a larger number of undergraduates cuz there's a larger number of undergraduates at the school, but you won't be alone. There's also the, like, like, graduate, uh, the graduate council that has a lot of really powerful leaders in there that would be great connections to make. And I'd be happy to introduce you to them. 

01:50:45
MICHAEL HUTCHINS I have a question then. Is there some kind of mentoring program that might be helpful for her? Is that, is that a possibility? 

01:51:00
CARMA There actually is a few mentorship possibilities. There is one that is for first generation students and one explicitly for  students of color. And, that will range from different backgrounds and ages as well. Uh, but it's specifically for first year students are interested in getting into a program, building community, kind of like I was talking about with some of the groups, and like, expanding your support network. It's a great place to make a lot of friends and to find people that have gone through similar struggles and came out on the right side. And, the great thing is  lot of those programs, if you really enjoy them, the next year you can come back as a mentor and kind of give it back to people. So, as soon as you can turn things around, you can give it back. And I can get your information. Some of it will be in those pamphlets I gave you there. And it's called peer mentor program. 

01:51:50
ANNIE Is there a program that's specifically for parents or for spouses? You know, for older adults? 

01:52:05
CARMA What do you mean? 

01:52:05
ANNIE Like a club for them. 

01:52:10
CARMA There isn't yet, but we'd be happy to help support you making one. 

01:52:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS One of the things that I was thinking about is that I could work with you to see if we could find something to bring other family members in so that she's not all by herself. 

01:52:30
CARMA Oh, yeah. That would be great. I mean, we have a lot of connections. We have a lot of non-traditional students that will come in, and that often falls into parents. Uh, and I would be happy to work with you on that. That would be exciting. I mean, that needs to happen. 

01:52:40
ANNIE Okay. 

01:52:45
CARMA Would you make an investment and say that you'll help us build that up? 

01:52:45
ANNIE I, I'll try. 

01:52:50
CARMA All right. Trying's a good start. 

01:52:50
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:52:50
CARMA So, I'm gonna go grab the information from the different presidents of the club, and get you a little bit more information for the peer mentorship program. Uh, and I'll be back in a few minutes. 

01:53:05
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Annie, how do you think I went? 

01:53:05
ANNIE It wasn't, it wasn't as scary as I thought it was. 

01:53:10
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. 

01:53:15
ANNIE Yeah, it was okay. 

01:53:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS What was it that you liked about what you heard today? 

01:53:20
ANNIE I had a lot more options than I thought I would have. I didn't realize there were so many different groups on campus. 

01:53:30
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So, as we think about it, I want you to know that I'd be willing to work with them to make sure that there are things in place if and when you decide you want to pursue this further. Of pieces that she gave you, which are the ones that would be most helpful to you, do you think? 

01:53:55
ANNIE Uh, well definitely one group about, for Asian-American women. Uh, and then the one about, you know, parent group or family group that might begin. I think those two would be the most helpful. 

01:54:15
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. Do you want to think about this, explore it a little bit, and then set up an appointment with me for a week from now to see where you are with that and where we go from here? 

01:54:30
ANNIE Yeah, I feel like I need more time to think about it. 

01:54:35
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So, let's just focus on you getting the information, thinking about it yourself, and then we can bring in other things later. 

01:54:45
ANNIE Okay. 

01:54:50
MICHAEL HUTCHINS Okay. So, next Friday? 

01:54:55
ANNIE Okay. 

01:55:00
[sil.] 

01:55:00

01:55:00
5 "Forces" of Counseling and Psychotherapy The Social Justice Counseling Session 

01:55:00
Processing the 5 Approaches to Psychotherapy with the Client Manivong J. Ratts, Ph.D., Assistant Professor Seattle University and Annie, the client 

01:55:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi, Annie, how are you? 

01:55:15
ANNIE Hi, I'm good, thanks. And you? 

01:55:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm really good, thank you. Well, I just want to thank you for, uh, being able to work with each of our five therapists. You've had an opportunity to work with Dr. Sheri Hunt, who was really operating from a psychoanalytic perspective. Uh, Katherine Nordell who was working as a C.B.T. therapist, uh, demonstrating elements of C.B.T., and you also had an opportunity to work with Steven Scheutz, who worked, uh, from an existential/humanistic paradigm. Uh, Dr. Agnes Kwong, who was working from a multicultural framework. And then, the last therapist you worked with was Dr. Michael Hutchins, who was operating from a social justice framework. And, what I wanted to do today was just spend some time with you to sort of process each of those sessions, uh, and if, just sort of hear from you in terms of what you liked, didn't like about your work with each of the therapists, and, and what resonated with you. Uh, is that okay? 

01:56:20
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. 

01:56:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS If we can start with the psychoanalytic perspective. That was the first therapist you worked with, Dr. Sheri Hunt. Uh, what was your experience like as a client working with her, if you can share a little bit. 

01:56:35
ANNIE It felt really enlightening. Uh, I know when I was telling my story, she just drew so many connections, uh, from my childhood and how that, uh, plays out into I'm currently acting. Uh, so in the moment when I was sitting with her, she made so much sense. And it felt very, like, "Yes, yes, yes!" You know, everything she says makes so much sense. Uh, and I just felt there was such a groove going on. Uh, it felt, it felt really enlightening. 

01:57:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS It sounds like a lot of,  you were gaining a lot of insight. 

01:57:15
ANNIE Right, right. But then, you know, after, after the session and having time to think about it and process it, I felt very, I felt like I couldn't really say no because the connections she was making made so much sense. But then, it just felt a bit, it felt, cuz it makes so much sense, but it didn't feel pinpoint. Does that make sense? 

01:57:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Help me understand that. 

01:57:55
ANNIE Uh, like, the connection just made a lot of sense, however, you know, you know when I went home and processed it, I'm like, well, it could have been this, it could've been that. Uh, I felt like the conclusions were kind of assumed, but maybe not accurate if that makes sense. At the moment when I was with her, she made a lot of sense, you know, so, uh, it was really, it was really enlightening, uh, but I do wonder about, uh, the accuracy of it. Yeah, and she she just seemed so knowledgeable that it was kind of hard to go, you know, I don't know, but she seems so knowledgeable, and she was drawing so many connections so fast. And, as I was telling my stories, I was very, there was a lot of stuff going on inside, you know. So I felt like it just made sense everything she connected. And I couldn't sit down and filter it and process her, uh, connections. But at the moment it felt like the flow was so good. So, it just felt like, "Yes, yes, yes." 

01:59:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, it sounds like what I hear you saying is you really connected with her in the session. You liked the insights she was giving you, because it made a lot of logical sense. 

01:59:20
ANNIE Right. 

01:59:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS In terms of connecting with, uh, your life story, if you will. 

01:59:25
ANNIE Right. 

01:59:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS And I hear you saying also at the same time you liked her expertise and knowledge, uh, that she brought into the session. I'm also hearing you say in a sense you wonder if, if maybe needing more time is important to be able to make sure these connections she's making, these insights, are accurate. 

01:59:50
ANNIE Right. 

01:59:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS If I'm hearing you correctly. 

01:59:50
ANNIE Yes. 

01:59:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Once you went outside of the session and just had time to process it a little bit more. 

01:59:55
ANNIE Right. Yeah. 

02:00:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS How about the cognitive/behavioral therapist, Katherine Nordell? 

02:00:05
ANNIE Yeah, I really, I really felt like we had a really, it felt, our relationship felt more equal. 

02:00:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS  Then the first one? 

02:00:15
ANNIE Right, then with Dr. Hunt. It felt more equal, uh, but I felt like, she focused a lot of course on my, my thoughts and my feelings. Uh, and it, I didn't feel as listened to. It just felt like there was sort of a, a pattern or path she wanted to drive me to. Cuz, I feel that makes, there is so much more, and it felt kind of narrow. 

02:00:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. It sounds like you're saying you felt like she had a direction that she wanted to take you. 

02:00:55
ANNIE Right. 

02:00:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS And, and that felt limiting. 

02:00:55
ANNIE  Right. 

02:01:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS But, at the same time I'm hearing you say you felt the relationship was more egalitarian. You are equals in, in your work together, if you will, compared to with Dr. Hunt. 

02:01:10
ANNIE  Right. 

02:01:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, okay, okay. Uh, anything else you like about your work with Nordell, Katherine Nordell? 

02:01:20
ANNIE Uh, yeah. I just think that we had a really great rapport. I think I really trusted her. Yeah, I think that's the thing that sticks out the most. The rapport we had with each other. And I felt, yeah, I just felt it was really equal. Yeah. 

02:01:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS  Okay. How about with Steven Scheutz, the therapist who was operating from an existential/humanistic paradigm? What was that experience like for you? 

02:01:45
ANNIE Uh, I felt kind of confused with the whole experience, because the questions he asked to me to make much sense for me to do certain things. Uh, and I felt like it was about me, me, me. And I understand that therapy is about me, but there are so many other things going on, like my family, my husband that to focus only on me and not bring them into the equation, it felt kind of silly. Not silly, but, uh, yeah, it was, it just wasn't, uh, because I can't just think about me. You know, I can't just focus on me. There are other people, you know, near me. So, it felt like, uh, I felt, I felt like he couldn't relate to what I was going through. I remember the one, the one question about, uh, (inaudible) going to get the, the slushy question, uh, I feel like that's not, that's not me. That's not what I would do, uh, and it seemed a bit strange to ask that question. It didn't seem kind of relevant, so, yeah. But however, I did like, I think it was him, uh, when he said that this is a safe space for you, for you to feel your, to say what you want and feel your emotions, cuz I think he was the one who said that. Yeah. So I really appreciated that. Then I realized that this is what the spaces for. 

02:03:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, you like to the fact that he was able to set that tone for you. 

02:03:30
ANNIE Yeah. 

02:03:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS But, I also hear you saying one of the limitations that you had was you didn't feel like he truly connected with you. 

02:03:40
ANNIE Right. 

02:03:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Or really understood you as an Asian-American in terms of just looking at your family dynamics and, and focusing more so on sort of you as an individual. 

02:03:50
ANNIE Right, right. 

02:03:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS  Which, I'm hearing you say is a limited perspective of who you are. 

02:03:55
ANNIE Right. 

02:03:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS  In relation to your experience. 

02:04:00
ANNIE Is that, is that very Western? Yeah, very Western. 

02:04:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's interesting because with Katherine you are talking about how it seemed like there was more direction or she kind of knew where she was going, uh, and, and there was a logical sequence in terms of her work with you. And with Steven, what I'm hearing you say, if I'm hearing you correctly is that there wasn't necessarily that logical progression of, of what you were doing. Is that, did you feel that Bush Mark 

02:04:35
ANNIE Right. Yeah, it felt very much like bouncing back and forth, the questions that were asked, cuz I know, uh, there was some frustration, uh, cuz the way I answered the question, uh, I couldn't answer the question the way he wanted me to answer it. I could sense that he was kind of frustrated, because I couldn't see what he was wanting me to say, uh, so I felt he was repeating a lot of things, repeating the question in a different way to sort of get me to an answer that he wants me to see. Yeah, so it didn't feel logical. It just felt sort of circular, and like a tennis ball back and forth, back and forth. 

02:05:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Which is interesting, because existential/humanistic theorists and practitioners tend to be, are known to be directionless in terms of just nondirective. 

02:05:25
ANNIE Right. 

02:05:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS In their approach, and cognitive behaviorists tend to be a little bit more, uh, structured in their work with clients. And it's interesting that you are pointing that out or that you're experiencing that. 

02:05:40
ANNIE Oh, cool. 

02:05:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS So. How about with Dr. Agnes Kwong, the multicultural therapist? 

02:05:45
ANNIE I honestly must say that I felt the most listened to with her. I felt the pacing was equal. Just, the pacing was really good. I just felt really listened to, and I felt like she had no agenda, uh, and she just listened. So, yeah. 

02:06:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS  What were things she was doing that made you feel connected or that you, or feel listened to? Were there things in the session that were happening? 

02:06:20
ANNIE  I think a lot of it was body language, you know. Yeah, it's just may be the way she says, "Mm-hmm",You know. I can't be, I can't remember any exact phrases, but just, I just felt listened to, just the simple, may be verbal and facial responses. Yeah, I just felt really listened to, with her. Yeah. 

02:06:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Did you feel that her, uh, racial identity sort of, uh, helped in terms of you connecting with her or have an influence in your ability to connect her? The fact that you are both Asian females? 

02:07:10
ANNIE  I think maybe, but I'm not quite sure. Because I felt, I feel more equal with Katherine in terms of like, just personality and, uh, not personality but just like equal. But, with Nancy, with Dr. Kwong, she felt a little bit more knowledgeable than I am, but still there's still that sense of like caring I guess. So, I don't know exactly what it is that made me feel that way with her. I'm not not quite sure if it is similar in culture identity. I'm not quite sure. 

02:07:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. What was your experience like with Dr. Michael Hutchins, who was really operating from a social justice framework and did something a little bit different than the other therapists? 

02:08:05
ANNIE Right, yeah. He did stuff I didn't know that counseling do. And, I like to that he thought out-of-the-box and helped me find resources and other options. So that part I really liked, cuz I saw a bigger picture of what counseling can do. But, similar to C.B.T., it felt very, uh, directed. I just felt I was answering questions back and, back and, I was just constantly answering questions. I didn't feel like, I didn't feel like he really knew me. I just felt like I just kept answering questions that he had for me. So. 

02:08:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, now that you've had an opportunity to work with all five therapists, if there was a therapist you were going to continue working with, who might that be? 

02:08:55
ANNIE I think personally I think I'm a better fit with Dr. Kwong, Dr. Kwong. And perhaps it is we are the same, same culture, background. I just felt, it's the fact that I felt really listened to. I felt like she saw me and she heard me. I felt like she didn't rush me. And, I think that the directions the other counselors went. I think if I had more time with her she would have gone those directions also. And it was only our first session. Yeah, so I like to think that, you know, if we had more time we would've gone. Because she did ask a bit about my childhood, like Dr. Hunt, and she did ask me about stuff I was thinking and feeling, like Katherine. Yeah. 

02:09:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS So, she kind of brought elements of other theories you felt in your work with her. 

02:10:05
ANNIE Right, right 

02:10:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Or her work with you. She had a little bit of everything. 

02:10:10
ANNIE I think so. 

02:10:10
