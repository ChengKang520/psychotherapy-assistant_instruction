UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION OF THIS MATERIAL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY ANY MEANS, IS LEGALLY PROHIBITED TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY Family Therapy at a Distance A Case of Depression 

00:00:45
JAY HALEY This is one of a series of training films on learning and teaching therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What is presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapist as well as to change clients since they must learn on how to change people in distress. The films offered valuable material for discussions since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with the trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going in to do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages said on the monitor but the clients cannot. In this case a young man is brought in as a consultation since the therapist was seeing him elsewhere and wanted special help for him. 

00:02:00
He’s been like that for about 12 years since he came over here to America. And basically, he left his family to come out here when he was about 18 or 19 and ah… to pursue medical school. And he was doing pretty well. He got… He got good grades for a while, but then he started to get depressed and that started to knock his grades down and he lost his motivation. And he, I guess started… started seeing a psychologist. Now, he’d been… He’d been in therapy in and out for a long time. 

00:02:30
JAY HALEY Why don’t you… What are you trying to solve with him? 

00:02:35
He wants to be able to alleviate his depression. 

00:02:40
JAY HALEY The presenting problem is being depressed. 

00:02:40
He doesn’t have many friends. He spends most of his time at home. He doesn’t leave the house. He plays computer games, these three card games all day. 

00:02:55
JAY HALEY If he failed, who… whom would he react? I mean, if you take a matter before us and failed within the… (inaudible ). 

00:03:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:05
JAY HALEY Did somebody react? 

00:03:10
He? You know we talk about that. He… He seems to say… I mean he just doesn’t wanna be a failure in his family’s eyes, so I guess his father (crosstalk)(inaudible). Yeah! 

00:03:20
JAY HALEY More than his mother, you know? 

00:03:20
Yeah I think so. His father is a physician as well. Women are more oppressed there and they wear veils and… He just wanted to come to America and be able to date and pursue medical school, something like that. (Inaudible ) can see the video you can… you can you can understand a lot more of his… 

00:03:35
JAY HALEY (Inaudible ). 

00:03:37
…how his demeanor is. 

00:03:37
JAY HALEY I would assume this guy is failing in relating to the family. You have no access to the family. Therefore, you have to do something that’s by mail or by telephone, get a connection with the family in such a way that there’s a change. What have you tried to do with him? 

00:03:55
Well, one thing was, you know he spends so much… so much time indoors. He won’t, you know leave the house really at all. Ah… Like two weeks ago we recommended that, you know he go outside for a… well just go outside no matter what it takes. Go outside for 20 minutes. Just go for a walk and return back. And… Then of course he puts up a lot of resistance because he seems to have tried everything. 

00:04:15
JAY HALEY It sounds like previous therapy has been at work. 

00:04:20
Oh, that the man is you know he is a… he’s a basketful of just you know "ism’s" and all sorts of lingo. I mean, he’s definitely been in therapy, but nothing has really… really helped him. He was just under the impression that you come to America and there’s women everywhere. 

00:04:35
JAY HALEY There are! 

00:04:35
You know, the land full of milk and honey. And there are. It’s true. Ah… But like he said, he… he said he was shot down a lot. He’d ask women out, and they’d say, no thanks or they’d say okay and they wouldn’t last past a first date. 

00:04:45
JAY HALEY I think that (inaudible ) predicted women(ph) that he… he knows what you’re going to say and he knows how to undo it. And the problem is, ah… is how to get the guy if… if he’s had a lot of therapy, he’s got more insight than he knows what to do, about why he does, what he does and how it’s related to his childhood and all this. 

00:05:05
He knows that. 

00:05:10
JAY HALEY But it has nothing to do with getting over the problem. 

00:05:10
He did follow through on the intervention in terms of going outside the house and closing… 

00:05:15
JAY HALEY For how long? 

00:05:15
He did it every day of last week, actually. 

00:05:15
JAY HALEY Oh, well that’s very good. Doing the usual things, but he’s been through that. So you’ve got to do something unusual may be. 

00:05:25
So you’re talking about a little paradox in there just saying, you know what, that might be the case. You are going to go the next 40 years of your life stuck in the house playing those three games. 

00:05:30
JAY HALEY If you could, challenge him in such a way that he does something helpful for himself to prove you wrong rather than because you ask him to. If you did that for example if you said that, I think you should have a date… I think you should write your father and say that you are getting quite interested in women here. And what will he answer if you do that? And I don’t know what the guy will answer, but he’ll say either he will be pleased or he’ll put you down and say it’s not true. And you say that this is what he’s going to do in all. You are going to be very surprised at his response. So why don’t you write him a letter and I will help you write the letter. And that’s… You don’t have to lie and say I have a date, but you have to say I’m becoming more a person who admires beautiful women in this place. 

00:06:25
I don’t know how that would go off in the (inaudible )? 

00:06:31
JAY HALEY Well, I don’t know either, but he would do it if… if you persuade him that his father will love that. His father will say that’s wonderful. I’m so glad you’re enjoying yourself with this woman. He will say that isn’t what my father would say. 

00:06:45
Right. 

00:06:45
JAY HALEY You say it is. 

00:06:50
You just want me to insist that? 

00:06:50
JAY HALEY That’s right. I know your father is better than you do. 

00:06:50
So he’ll write the letter to convince you that (inaudible ). 

00:06:56
JAY HALEY That’s right. You want him to do it. Then this father is gonna get the letter saying I’m enjoying myself with a woman. Your father’s got to respond to that. Now he’s either going to come against it or with it or say to his wife, our son is going mad or… It'll make some action. If his father is a physician and he keeps failing as a physician, you could have him write a letter saying that, I decided to be more successful as a physician that you are. I think I’ve learned more in the last few years and I can go to medical school and succeed. 

00:07:30
(Inaudible ) right now he would fight me tooth and nail on it saying that. I mean, he… he feels like a total failure and he doesn’t really have plans I’m going at this point. He feels he’s too old to begin again. 

00:07:35
JAY HALEY But what do you think he should be doing? 

00:07:40
I think he should be pursuing what he wants to do. 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY I know, but what do you want him to do? Do you think he should go back to medical school? 

00:07:50
I think… I mean, if that’s truly his goal. 

00:07:50
JAY HALEY Well, he put some time in there. It’s the only thing he’s put some time in it (inaudible ). And it is surprising… He has a… He has a rule that he has to fail, and your problem is how to change that rule in such a way that he doesn’t fail, unless you don’t fail with him. 

00:08:10
Yeah, that'll be nice. 

00:08:10
JAY HALEY But I think that he’s not going to change until he behaves differently. 

00:08:15
Right! But he can’t get himself to behave differently at this point. 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY And talking to him about why he doesn’t behave differently only makes him more talk about why he doesn’t behave differently. You’ve got to get him to do something, and it’s not an easy one. I mean, to get that guy to do something you ask is a (inaudible ). 

00:08:36
But he did… He did go out the door (inaudible ). 

00:08:38
JAY HALEY Well, you’ve gotto… you’ve gotto start him doing something. One of the ways to think about depression is that… is that they come out of it when they get angry. So if you (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:08:45
(crosstalk)(inaudible) motivated enough, you mean. 

00:08:50
JAY HALEY So if you can get… You can get a depressed person angry, but to prove… prove you wrong or something like that, you got a fair chance of… you get him started to doing something. And ah… this guy could use some anger. I think he’s probably mad at the world at the moment, it doesn't come out. But anyhow think about how you… how should be as far as you’re concerned. He should be at medical school; he should be having dates with girls (inaudible ) and what else? He should have a job to support himself. 

00:09:20
These are all the things that he wants. 

00:09:25
JAY HALEY Yeah! And those are your tasks or your goals to get him to do those things. 

00:09:30
Yeah, well! Well, his number one goal is to alleviate the sadness. 

00:09:30
JAY HALEY We used to hypothesize there are unconscious desire for failing or something like that. Now it’s because there are consequences in an organization if you fail or if you succeed. And what consequences they would be, we don’t know, because we can’t see his family, but it must be his family. It must be his father if he’s gone to medical school, his father is a doctor. I mean the connections are obvious. 

00:09:55
Right! 

00:09:55
JAY HALEY The way you described the guy, I would think of saying to him, I have a plan that will solve a lot of your depression, because you try things and they fail and (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:10:05
Well… Now, he’ll allow… But he… he allows them to fail. There’s something in him that sabotages him as he sees it. 

00:10:10
JAY HALEY Well, he didn’t say that. There’s something that sabotages you, and becoming a doctor is an example, that you just didn’t make it as a doctor. Why don’t you become a nurse? Take nurse’s training. You got your ambulance experience. You got the doctor’s experience so far. Be a nurse. You can make a very good nurse. I mean, this guy’s not going to be a nurse. But if you insist he ought to be a nurse, you’ll only get mad. 

00:10:45
That’s funny. I’m trying to picture him. I mean, it’s funny because I’m trying to picture him getting mad at me. I’m trying to picture him getting mad at me. And it will be… I mean, it would be… it would be great if he did. That’s for sure. 

00:10:55
JAY HALEY I would think about doing something that he does despite you. I know that you don’t think of that as the way therapists behave, but in… in therapy what you do is you make a relationship by conversations flowing and so on. And you set up the relationship in which you can give a directive and then do it. And that’s the purpose of the conversation, really. This is to set up that relationship so that you can introduce an… an action that will make a change. And that they’ll do it. In this case, this guy is a professional at not doing it. So you kind of do it in some funny way, paradoxical way or. 

00:11:35
Will that alleviate his… his depression? 

00:11:40
JAY HALEY If he makes you mad it will and to make him mad. 

00:11:45
I mean, that would somewhat alleviate it for good? 

00:11:50
JAY HALEY Well, you if don’t know you do the next thing. I mean, if you get a day of him not depressed, because he’s arguing in his head about you, then that’s the day and maybe you can get two days. But I think you need to connect him to his family in such a way that… that they hear that he’s succeeding or that he tells him, I’ve decided that I’m going to graduate school, leave it open on the doctors. I’m going back to this graduate school. 

00:12:20
Just leave it open? 

00:12:20
JAY HALEY And to leave it open or say, I’m doing… I think they wouldn’t believe him if he said he’s going to go back to medical school. You’ve got to put some thought on how to get him to do something positive. And when you put the thought on that, you keep coming back to yourself that he does it in relation to you to prove you’re wrong, or to prove you’re right, or because he’s your friend. It may be… I mean there’re two kinds of directives. There's also you tell him what to do and that’s it, and those when you get paradoxical in some way and restrain it from changing. And it sounds like you’re straightforward. You began with him last week to get out of the house for that long. It’s a triumph for this guy, and I think you should pursue that track. 

00:13:05
Well, my idea behind it was that if there is indeed this subconscious evil villain that’s trying to hold him back… 

00:13:10
JAY HALEY Something happens with them when he succeeds. It’s taken for granted in family therapy that’s the situation. It’s just complicated here, because he lives far from home(ph) and he’s living alone and unhappy. But that’s why it’s important to connect him with the family and make some hypothesis in relation to them. Because the individual approach of him being here and having ideas just hasn’t worked, and discussing his family won’t work. 

00:13:40
Well, yeah I think… 

00:13:40
JAY HALEY There’s got to be a letter to them or a phone call to them, or something that says that if you have to look at what is he doing assuming that his failing in life must have something to do with his parents and then set up a letter to them saying he’ll succeed, and see what response it gets. And he’ll have upset parents. It’s the hypothesis. 

00:14:05
I don’t think so? 

00:14:05
I’m wondering when we make a distinction between an environmental or extraneous and… and start making referrals, because there is a… a concern for organic origin. He’s on antidepressant? 

00:14:25
He’s already gone to county mental health. But like my supervisor said, you know, the dosages are really low. In fact, they are below the standard. There’s no real enjoyment and he… and he considers this whole depression very painful. 

00:14:35
JAY HALEY And with the only son, they are going to be divided over how to raise him, how to deal with him, what is to be expected of him. I can see why he got out of there. But he didn’t get out of there. He’s still psychologically with them. 

00:14:50
He talks to them on the phone you know (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY Oh, how often does he do that? 

00:14:50
Yeah, I mean, you know, at least probably a couple of times a month. 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY I don’t know what the letter might be. Well, it should be something that… that you predicted happens in a certain way because you know about families, and he says, not in my family that won’t happen, and done in such a way that he’s got to write the letter in order to prove you are wrong. 

00:15:10
I know what you are getting at. I just wish you would give me the direct… direct answer. 

00:15:15
JAY HALEY But I don’t know the letter. I mean, that’s… that's something you have to devise. And it’s… it (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:15:20
I need a little more information about the family (crosstalk)(inaudible)? 

00:15:25
JAY HALEY Should he write to father or the mother? 

00:15:30
Right, you know. 

00:15:30
JAY HALEY But it should be a letter that says that he’s doing well, that he’s succeeding or that he’s found an interesting woman. 

00:15:40
Even if it’s not true? 

00:15:45
JAY HALEY Well, look among these women and say, were any of them interesting? I’m trying to get him to say something positive about a woman, so it won’t be lying when he writes him and says that there’s something positive about this woman I met. He probably wouldn’t write, he’d telephone and that’s how you could control. 

00:16:00
That's what I'm thinking of. Right. 

00:16:05
JAY HALEY I am sure he’d say father is disappointed, and therefore he could write to father and say, yeah, he could even say depending on when you decide, I’m sorry I disappointed you. 

00:16:15
Okay! You have to wait until the father gives a response or say it in that first letter, see I know you are disappointed me but I forgive you for being disappointing me. 

00:16:20
JAY HALEY Right. 

00:16:20
That's a good idea. 

00:16:25
JAY HALEY That’s complicated enough so the father can’t answer it easily. 

00:16:25
Yeah! That’ll draw him off a little bit. 

00:16:30
JAY HALEY But anyhow, I think you should think about how to communicate between him and his parents on something that frees him some from this failure business on the hypothesis that, that’s related to them and… and he's… he’s… he's helpful to them by failing. I mean, this is one of the discoveries of family therapy too. The kids help their parents by having symptoms themselves. 

00:16:55
Yeah. 

00:17:00
JAY HALEY But you have to set it up so he makes a change an add a long distance, which is hard. Whatever ideas he’s putting into this letter (inaudible ), which is a change, because he’s gonna say something in relation to his father that’s different than he usually does. But the best choice would be to have him send a letter. 

00:17:20
And it’s so the letter should be somewhat confrontive or at least, you know? 

00:17:25
JAY HALEY It should be that he’s successful or going to be successful or finally decided that he’s had enough and he’s now thinking seriously about going back to school. Just anything that his father would say; My God, he’s changing. And the mother would say; It’s not your fault. 

00:17:50
I think, I’ll definitely will follow through on something like that. Yeah. 

00:17:55
Do you feel okay to do that? 

00:17:55
Oh yeah sure. 

00:17:55
A Week Later 

00:17:55
Okay, you were gonna present what you did. We have a few minutes and I think this is more depressing(ph). 

00:18:05
Let me tell you what I did. The case of the depressed man. I wasn’t able to implement what we had talked about the letter, because we didn’t talk much about the family. We didn’t… I didn’t get to talk much at all. My supervisor wanted me to really, you can see… watch the other video with me, wanted me to really hold in on his emotions, helped him to hold in on his emotions. He’s dissociated. But this is the situation and this is what I prescribed, because I wanted to do something that was somewhat in the strategic realm. So, basically he's told me that, he… a lot of times he… he sacrifices his own emotional interest for other people. Ah… I guess I probably said enough. Now, there’s a situation where he was talking to one friend of his, this girl, and when he calls her it doesn’t cost anything, but when she calls him it turns out, it’s a toll call. And he told her to call him and she called and this phone bill ended up being $200. Right! So then he… he told her that he would pay the whole $200. But I told him, I said, but under no circumstances are you to pay $200 on that bill, alright. And the other thing is I told him, I want you to really focus on your emotions when you’re weighing the two and what emotions come up when you think about paying absolutely nothing and telling her that, or giving her $300. Because my other supervisor wanted me to really help him focus on his emotions. 

00:19:20
JAY HALEY Of course he’s bringing out peoples’ emotions on the assumption that related to change in some way. And ah… It’s different if you provoke him to get mad at you, then you’re working out a relationship with him. But ah… I don’t see the positive nature of him paying an extra hundred bucks unless it’s… it's a woman who’s very tight with money or there’s some special issue around him and her and the money. What has she… What has she said about the phone call? 

00:19:50
Well she feels that she… She… She tells him, "I can’t afford it, and you are the one who told me to call you." But he didn’t know that it was a toll call, so she should at least accept some responsibility, but she’s not willing to. 

00:20:05
JAY HALEY This is one of the differences when you get focused on emotions. Often you get into the emotional situation that doesn’t involve an organizational problem. And the idea of writing to father is an organizational problem. Whether he fails or succeeds, if it’s in relation to his parents, it’s important that he relate to them in such a way that he can succeed, if you give a task in an organizational arrangement. With this one giving an extra hundred bucks, I don’t see how it affects him organizationally unless he’s trying to break with this girl or get together with this girl in this way. 

00:20:40
Well, he was trying to get together with her, but he can pretty much see now that, they’re not, they haven’t been close. They don’t know each for that long, maybe a month or two. 

00:20:55
Well, it doesn’t matter. If you want to have a relationship with me, and I ask… and you ask me to call you, I’m not going to pay for that, you have to pay for me. 

00:21:00
No it’s never ever asserted himself, and he said, and he’s always complaining about his low self-esteem that he allows other people to always step on him, that he gives himself to people when he's already drained. 

00:21:10
JAY HALEY What will that do to your relationship when you cost him an extra hundred dollars? 

00:21:15
If I gotto cost someone an extra dollars? 

00:21:15
JAY HALEY It does cost… No, you're costing this guy? 

00:21:20
Yeah. 

00:21:20
I don’t know what his credit limit is, but it may not be really a hundred dollars (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:21:25
JAY HALEY But I mean in relation to you? 

00:21:30
Well I know that he’ll probably look at me as a different type of therapist who’s willing to confront him or challenge him. 

00:21:35
JAY HALEY You’ll be less predictable, you mean? 

00:21:35
Oh, yeah! 

00:21:35
JAY HALEY Do you have a prediction, which he’ll use? 

00:21:40
Well, you know, maybe that’s 300. 

00:21:45
JAY HALEY Will we know next week? 

00:21:45
Well he will at least come with a version, yeah, I will, we’ll find… And I’ll bring the tape in. If you want we can talk about it. 

00:21:50
JAY HALEY Sure! I just… I just wanna know how it came up. 

00:21:55
Okay, we've got three for 300. 

00:22:00
JAY HALEY You should ask him what his father would have done in this situation if you want to get into the family a little more? 

00:22:05
That’s good! This last time, when I really started asking him questions about emotions and things like that, he definitely sparked up and you know was intrigued if nothing else. 

00:22:15
Two Weeks Later 

00:22:15
JAY HALEY Do you want to tell about the latest report? 

00:22:20
Yeah, alright, I guess in a nutshell. He… He still hasn’t committed what he’s gonna do. He's gonna take it, bring it back to the table, put back on the table with her and… and tell her that he's gonna only pay $100 of it. 

00:22:35
Ah…Ah… 

00:22:35
That was his conclusion. 

00:22:40
Yeah, I knew it. 

00:22:40
He hasn't done it yet though. No, he’ll make it if that’s the way. 

00:22:45
No, (crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:22:45
But he ah… He really couldn’t… couldn’t… he couldn't commit to pay her nothing, because of the guilt and the trouble she would get in with her mom. 

00:22:55
JAY HALEY Well, I could use you as an example. There’s some argument that trainees behave the way that the supervisor has them deal with the clients. If you find a trainee who has very great difficulty getting a directive over, to get it delivered, then usually the client has a great deal of problem of doing what the therapist says. And I… I think it’s interesting what a struggle you had over writing that father a letter. 

00:23:25
Well, it’s really because I didn’t really know what to focus on. I really wasn’t sure that the things we talked about was an issue. 

00:23:30
JAY HALEY And so it’s the same with him. He doesn’t know what’s really an issue, particularly with his family I think. But anyhow, you’re gonna have him write a letter, right? 

00:23:45
Yeah, oh yeah! Yeah, it’s gonna be… It will be somewhere along the lines I guess of, you know, how much of success he is out here and how happy he is or something to that effect? 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY Right. 

00:23:55
You know, I have this whole issue about my parents pushing him to come out here and (inaudible ) live out here. He also acknowledged in this session though, he knows that he is lazy. 

00:24:05
JAY HALEY I'm sure he knows it. 

00:24:05
But he… But he said… he said… he said; "Look, you know let’s face it, I know that I’m, you know it’s pretty clear that I’m somewhat lazy, but I also have this depression and I’m not sure where the two meet.” 

00:24:15
JAY HALEY He’s trying to analyze it. 

00:24:20
Oh! You don’t understand. This guy… This guy analyzes a bug on a flower. I mean, everything is analyzed to the deepest level. 

00:24:25
JAY HALEY That’s a therapist’s, past therapist’s responsibility, really. If he writes a letter, the answer back will give you a lot of information about that family. One thing new is what you need with this guy, because he’s so ready not to have anything new. 

00:24:40
And he go around in circles forever. 

00:24:40
JAY HALEY That depends on you. 

00:24:45
Yeah. I mean, I’m… I’m working with, you know all my supervisors there and with you here, and he just keeps trying to figure out why I feels this way. 

00:24:50
JAY HALEY So you’re caught between two different ideologies really? 

00:24:55
Right, in some sense. 

00:24:55
JAY HALEY Well, most trainees are. 

00:25:00
But you can help ‘em. 

00:25:00
JAY HALEY You can try as long as they’re not completely incompatible you can negotiate ‘em. But if you felt you were really failing with this guy and he’s not changing, we can get the other supervisors to come in with you and that the three of us will talk, if you wanted to do that. But that’s only if it’s not going well. At the moment it’s uncertain. 

00:25:25
Well, like I said, I mean, if he follows through with the schooling and stuff, I’ll see that as a positive move forward. 

00:25:30
JAY HALEY Sure, that would be. 

00:25:30
You know, because the guy is not getting out of his house. I mean, he’s not… 

00:25:35
JAY HALEY If he became a successful older son in the eyes of the family, I think that would change a lot of things. One other things that I thought we ought to deal with tonight is the letter. 

00:25:45
Planning the First Live Supervision 

00:25:45
JAY HALEY He’s a guy who doesn’t improve, apparently, in therapy very much. That he’s had a lot of therapy. That he’s avoiding living normally and doing a career like he ought to do. So that he needs something that gets him started differently. And I think one of the things he’s doing is assuming that he can go to therapy forever. If not this therapist another therapist, because he’s been doing that with a number of therapists. So one possible, and that logically leads to one possible directive, and that is to tell him you want him to agree that you’re his last therapist, that he’ll never go to see another therapist again. 

00:26:40
Right, yeah! 

00:26:40
Wow! Is that possible? 

00:26:45
JAY HALEY I shouldn’t have encouraged the gentlemen to get better. 

00:26:50
Even if that means he has to see me for three years? 

00:26:50
JAY HALEY Whenever, the rest of his life. The rest of his life, he can’t have another therapist. If two years from now he gets depressed, he’s got to call you. 

00:27:05
Even if I live in Antarctica? 

00:27:05
JAY HALEY That’s right. He can deal with you on the phone. But you do get people who hang out in therapy forever. And they learn the language and they learn the ideas like he apparently has. 

00:27:15
We’ll hope as though that’ll come up (inaudible ). 

00:27:20
JAY HALEY Do you think you could say you want him to be his last therapist? 

00:27:25
Oh sure, I’ll say that to him. 

00:27:25
He's coming in tomorrow? 

00:27:25
Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:25
Oh wow! 

00:27:25
He’s supposed to. 

00:27:30
JAY HALEY Well, we hope he’s coming in, yeah. You said… You started by saying I have something that’s gonna be very important to do that I want you to do and it’s going to mean a basic change in your whole attitude about yourself. And I want you to agree you’ll never go to another therapist after me. That you’ll finish with therapy with me. I mean, you want to put it as positive as that. 

00:27:50
Yeah! 

00:27:50
JAY HALEY The temptation is to make it tentative. What can you think of the idea? 

00:27:55
Right! You don’t want to give him an out? 

00:28:00
JAY HALEY That's right. 

00:28:00
Yeah! You want me to pursue the letter as well? 

00:28:00
JAY HALEY Sure. 

00:28:00
Okay. 

00:28:05
JAY HALEY Is he going to bring it? 

00:28:05
No, we haven’t mentioned it. I was going to bring it up tonight. 

00:28:10
JAY HALEY You haven’t… You didn’t talk to him about the letter before? 

00:28:10
No. No, actually, no, I did mention the letter last time. And I’ll tell you the truth, I did mention the letter, but it was… we didn’t pursue it for too long. So I want to go back to it. 

00:28:25
JAY HALEY That’s something you would have to set up with some care if you want him to do it. 

00:28:35
And the running theme would be idea that he… he would say something positive. 

00:28:40
JAY HALEY And lead him. I wouldn’t make it too big you know. 

00:28:40
Yeah. 

00:28:40
JAY HALEY Like I’m going to be successful. It should be, I’ve decided it’s important that I be successful or more tentatively like that. You… You need to collaborate with him about the letter on what his father would think when he sees it, and how would his father understand it and so on. I mean, you treat it like the father is there or it's just a letter instead, you know. I’m sure older son with a father-physician, that's an issue (inaudible ). It’s what you’re assuming. It’s then it’s a question of how to… how to manage it so he can succeed no matter what his father does. You should get some kind of action involved in it, because he knows already that… that if he succeeds, he’s going to have to bring his parents over here. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:40
Well, what can I do? 

00:29:40
JAY HALEY Well, you can just, you can say where would you have your parents live if you were successful? I mean, they would, and you put it like, well they might expect something of you. They might expect you to support them and have a place to live. Is there a place in Santiago where you’d like to place them? 

00:30:00
So where did you place them? 

00:30:00
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:30:00
He’d say they'd be living in my bedroom or something you know. We talked about that, and he has indicated, we talked something about that he had indicated that you know they’d be living with him. But he said, now see but he said, I'm very… I'm very upset about it, because you know I can't afford to have them (inaudible ), I can't afford to support my father. So I'm gonna ask him to make that commitment? 

00:30:20
JAY HALEY Right! And in doing that you have to make that commitment. 

00:30:25
Sure. 

00:30:25
JAY HALEY Well it’s quite a commitment with a guy who's got a history of therapy. 

00:30:30
He is going to be calling me for the next 10 years of my life. 

00:30:30
JAY HALEY They have to answer this question. Do you want them to answer in a letter or back on the phone? I think they will be back on the phone when they get the letter. So you have to anticipate what you’re going to say on the phone. 

00:30:45
So I’m supposed to work through that with him? 

00:30:50
JAY HALEY Sure. 

00:30:50
I mean, getting to some point is that… 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY He’s going to say they’ll be pleased that I’m doing well. You need to say they won’t be pleased. They’re going to be upset and negative about it. And he’s going to say, I know my parents better than you do probably or words to that effect. But he’s got to prove it to you, and then if he writes it and they get it, they’re gonna to call and he has to, he has to find that negative something in the call. 

00:31:20
But then what does he do with that? 

00:31:20
JAY HALEY Then you’re right. Then you are in the position of saying may be he could succeed just a little bit and they wouldn’t be so negative about him, may be they… You begin to work on improving to being normal. And… And only… you could, you kinda done it or you, you have him do it secretly. He signs up and he doesn’t tell his parents that he has signed up to medical school or whatever. Because why does he have to tell them everything, you know? But you are doing anything to get that guy to begin to succeed. 

00:32:00
Yeah! He’s really down about the medical school, because he wants to do it and go but he doesn’t have the money to apply. So, he’s using that as an obstacle now. 

00:32:15
JAY HALEY But if he settles for less, like being a nurse… 

00:32:15
I haven’t brought that up yet. 

00:32:20
JAY HALEY …his father… His father is the physician. 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:30
Observing the Live Interview 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:40
Getting back to the letter. I want us to come up with a rough draft. When he said, (inaudible ) and read… you are going to say something to the effect of you know I'm… I’m very, you know confident now about the future. I’m doing things now to… to put my life in a better position where I want to be in, and I’m very hopeful that in the future I’m going to be very successful. What do you think he’s going to think when he reads that? What’s his response to that? 

00:33:05
JAY HALEY You got the letter drafted. 

00:33:05
Now, he started this fight tooth and nail on it. I was… (inaudible ) I needed more information. 

00:33:15
JAY HALEY You need practice phrasing things as possibilities that make him sound like they’re an actuality, you know. And he’s a nice candidate for it. Did you think he was more cheerful at the end of the interview? 

00:33:30
Yeah, yeah! His affect picked up. I mean, if you saw the tapes (inaudible ) with my supervisor at the center, he's pretty much like this the whole time or I mean, he doesn't move much. 

00:33:40
Very good! 

00:33:40
JAY HALEY He can say, it might not be true, but I’m feeling so much better I may succeed. 

00:33:45
See, I didn’t think he would allow that in the letter. I thought that he was going to be very emphatic and, like I said, self-selfish. 

00:33:55
JAY HALEY Well, you know what he did wrong to start with in his letter. He took away all credit from himself. He said, "I’ll improve with therapy and medication and I’ll be happy." But I think you ought to write another letter with him soon about him being with a woman. 

00:34:15
Oh yeah! 

00:34:20
To his parents? 

00:34:20
JAY HALEY To his parents that I’ve met a woman I’m fond of, you could say that. 

00:34:25
But he… But he hasn’t. 

00:34:25
He can talk over the phone then? 

00:34:25
JAY HALEY Then you could say, I've been thinking about a woman lately. I’m sure he has, you know. 

00:34:30
Well, but… I don’t know if he’s going to like this pattern of now he’s sending letters to his parents he’s going to obviously stay up all night trying to analyze and figure out why the heck I asked him to do that. 

00:34:40
What else does he have to do? 

00:34:45
JAY HALEY Well, there’re also two things in his life, his career and women right at the moment and his family as a background. So you work on what is most, you make most active whatever he’s most involved in. And a conversation doesn’t do it. It takes some action of some kind. 

00:35:05
That’s what I want to bring up. How he really didn’t do anything what I had suggested before. So, if I, you know, if I go through like ten different ideas or interventions and he doesn’t implement any of them, well, then you know… 

00:35:15
JAY HALEY You don’t go through ten. If he doesn’t do the next one, you handle it there. I would see this guy every two weeks at least. 

00:35:20
Oh yeah! 

00:35:20
JAY HALEY To give some time for something to happen in between sessions. But I thought you handled it very well tonight. 

00:35:30
Yeah! 

00:35:30
Thanks for saying so. It was… I mean, I felt like I was working. 

00:35:35
JAY HALEY The thing I objected to was… But to go to the telephone bill at the beginning when you do something else and then go in the middle and then go at the end there's too much of the telephone bill. But other than that you handled it very well. But keep in mind what your goal in therapy with this guy is to get him independent of you. That’s a major goal. 

00:35:50
Yeah! 

00:35:50
JAY HALEY And so, if you can get him to spontaneously do something that you haven’t recommended, you’re on your way you know. 

00:36:00
That's true. 

00:36:00
JAY HALEY So you… One of the things you can do is… is when you say; "If you’re courageous, you can do such and such." Then if he does such and such, he’s done something courageous you know. But anyhow, he’s a difficult guy. I mean, he’s a very experienced patient. Most of what you would try with him, he’s had tried with him, that's what I would guess. And therefore, you have to come up with something new. 

00:36:30
His real key is he’s trying to find out where his depression is coming from. 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY And he'll spend his life doing that, depression like that? You should make it… name it something else. I mean, it’s… 

00:36:45
He calls it sadness. 

00:36:45
JAY HALEY Sure, sadness would help or homesickness could help. I wonder if a little that in there, which might have happened to him at that time. 

00:36:55
How do we change the social situation? 

00:36:55
JAY HALEY You’re doing it. You’re changing your relationship to his parents. I mean, even all the way home tonight he’s thinking, what am I putting in this letter and will my father do this and will they not do that? 

00:37:05
Or he’s also thinking, what is this going to accomplish? That I mean, he even said that, you know. 

00:37:10
JAY HALEY Oh, better answer that you gave would be to say you’ll find that out when you do it. You’ll be surprised what the… what the reason is. 

00:37:20
You saw him. He covers all the bases. 

00:37:20
(inaudible ) softballs and stuff and he started (inaudible ). 

00:37:26
I don’t know. I mean, well I appreciate what you’re saying, I believe (inaudible ) therapist. I think you’ve done excellent work here, that is not my style. 

00:37:31
Yeah. 

00:37:35
You can do the stuff like you know play the proverbial violin when you start going back and forth at a single time just you know give him a couple of these and… 

00:37:45
But he always says you know what can I do? I mean he believes that when he finds that magic key to why he's depressed, something from his past then it’s gonna lift and he’s gonna be able to do all this you know. 

00:37:55
JAY HALEY Well, he’s had 12 years of therapy trying to find the cause. To shake that is very hard you know. 

00:38:05
But that’s the whole thing. I mean he will not allow himself to just not be depressed anymore. 

00:38:10
You know what he should… 

00:38:10
Planning the Second Live Supervision 

00:38:10
JAY HALEY I would pick something like getting a job and he has to have that job by a certain date. A month or two months or whatever, and everything in the session is organized about meeting that date. And I think you can activate him and even name a date. It’s a step forward. 

00:38:35
But the main thing that’s going on here is he has, the cause of the sadness, this depression, that keeps him from doing anything. 

00:38:40
JAY HALEY Do you think he took seriously that you were his last therapist? 

00:38:45
I don’t know. 

00:38:45
JAY HALEY If you wanted to do something more obscure, you would say, "I want you set a date for when you’ll go to work. And it shouldn’t be to go to work at a job that you won’t like.” 

00:38:55
Then he’s going to say, why? You know what he does. 

00:39:00
JAY HALEY He says why because you say why. I can see you have a lot of enthusiasm for these suggestions. Have you got two ways to handle it if he wrote the letter or if he didn’t? 

00:39:15
No. I hadn’t, and I didn’t really planned it out. 

00:39:20
JAY HALEY You should think about it. What you might do is if, in the middle of the interview, you’re feeling hopeless about him, I would just ask him to wait outside and come out here and we’ll help you be more hopeless. 

00:39:30
I need some help (inaudible ). 

00:39:35
JAY HALEY I think he’s the kind that brings out hopelessness in therapists. He’s been doing it for 12 years. 

00:39:40
Observing the Live Interview 

00:39:45
JAY HALEY The trainees are free to comment on the interview from behind a mirror as it happens. The instructions were unusual. Almost all the suggestions sent on the computer involve persuading the trainee to persuade the client to write a letter to his father. It’s important that the man do something, not just talk about it. Just as it’s important that the therapist do something, not just talk about it. 

00:40:10
[sil.] 

00:40:20
Did you think about the letter that we talked about last time? Did you write a letter? What did you do with it? Let me ask you this. What will your parents think about this in terms of success or how would they look at it if you talk about going back to school the whole… whole situation? 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:45
I wanted to know the letter this week. And then I assume they’ll be probably calling you after they get the letter or you’ll just speak with them shortly thereafter I guess. All right, so, is that a plan? 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:41:00
All right. I’ve done it. 

00:41:00
That was great. 

00:41:00
JAY HALEY Jay Haley I think you handled it very well. I mean, you got to the letter and you had it written. 

00:41:05
Got it to say what we wanted it to say. I mean, I was very pleased about that. 

00:41:05
JAY HALEY And you presented your differences with him very well. 

00:41:10
I think so. 

00:41:10
JAY HALEY I disagree with him, yeah. 

00:41:10
He did it. I was astounded. I really was. I did not think he would follow through because he questions everything. And, you know, after trying to figure out why, either way, whether he figures it out or not, he’s still going to… I guess maybe he’s figured to do something. 

00:41:25
He’s really followed through with everything that you have asked him to do now. 

00:41:30
JAY HALEY That’s right. 

00:41:30
It's like you expect him that he’s not gonna do it, but he does. 

00:41:35
Yeah, yeah. 

00:41:35
JAY HALEY He just questions it and then does it. Well, that means he’s going to mail it. 

00:41:40
Yeah. He’s going to mail it this week, yeah. (Inaudible ) class to that again. 

00:41:45
JAY HALEY Well I think it’s an interesting case. This is the kind of you often get in private practice, who’ve been in therapy for years. 

00:41:50
(inaudible ) 80 bucks an hour. 

00:41:52
JAY HALEY That's right. 

00:41:55
It’s a great. 

00:41:55
This is a good one here. 

00:41:55
It’s a good one to cut my eyeteeth on. That’s for sure. 

00:42:00
JAY HALEY He did it. He’ll educate you. One other things you might have done to make it a little more intense would be to have him do that whole letter, get it all set, and then tell him not to mail it. 

00:42:10
After all this? 

00:42:10
JAY HALEY After the work you went into it and all that you know. You just tell him it was only for his own education to help him out of his depression. He would be angry. 

00:42:20
Yeah, he would be angry because I’ve already… we’ve already discussed what the purpose was to discover what his reactions from his parents and maybe he’s eager to know what the reaction is. 

00:42:30
JAY HALEY Yeah! Well, he talks like he knows. 

00:42:35
Well, should I not have him mail the letter then? 

00:42:35
JAY HALEY Oh no! I was just saying that’s another alternative. If you want to get him mad that’s what I mean, because this guy needs to get mad about something. 

00:42:45
His affect was the brightest I’ve seen. You know, what did you guys think about the going back to school and he kept belittling it? I was really struggling with that because that is a humongous step for him. I mean, I saw that as a real positive development. 

00:42:55
JAY HALEY When he came in more cheerful, with most people who are patients you are pleased when they come in more cheerful. With him I would think he’s avoiding something. So he’ll act more cheerful so that you’ll ignore, like the letter he may not have to write if he’s cheerful about going back to school and all that you know.. 

00:43:15
That's another reason why I was pretty surprised when he did it, because I thought you know. 

00:43:20
JAY HALEY I would just assume he’s interpersonally very skillful. He’s sacrificing himself for his parents, but at the same time resents it and is in conflict with them. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t doing himself in for their sake. 

00:43:35
Yeah, could you have him though even do even more then? 

00:43:40
JAY HALEY If you do that… If that would improve them you can, yeah. This is part of the problem working from here you can’t get the parents’ reaction to something he does. 

00:43:50
Could you get the parents to come here? 

00:43:50
JAY HALEY The father is a physician, he may have a few bucks. 

00:43:55
They don't have the money. 

00:43:55
JAY HALEY I know. 

00:43:55
But yeah, yeah, we talked about it. 

00:44:00
JAY HALEY They're gonna come in and he kind of supports them with all… 

00:44:00
Yeah, that's the problem, he doesn't want them to come over anyway. I really believe though that out of loyalty those parents who believe that he is a screw-up, he’s (inaudible ). I think that’s a very real possibility. 

00:44:15
JAY HALEY Yeah, I would say it’s a nice hypotheses, because it gives you something to do, which is focused on the relationship with him and his parents. 

00:44:25
So you're worried about the loyalty (inaudible ) considerable loyalty at that cost. 

00:44:26
JAY HALEY That’s the problem. It’s stable if he fails. So he’s got to let them know regularly that he fails. 

00:44:35
Intellectually, like he would argue that… that’s impossible. His parents would want him to succeed. 

00:44:45
Observing the Next Live Interview 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:45:00
JAY HALEY Do you think he’s going to mail the letter? 

00:45:05
Yeah. Oh he, he said he wanted me to apologize to you guys because he just… he just didn’t realize that you guys really would have wanted to know what the response was right away. But, he said he would have mailed it sooner. 

00:45:15
JAY HALEY Would you believe him if he said he mailed it? 

00:45:15
Yeah, oh yeah. 

00:45:15
JAY HALEY I would too, but there was some vote in here that he might lie. 

00:45:20
Well, I don’t see that at all, but I guess anything is possible. But I’ll tell you I am hopeful. I mean seriously he first of all, you saw his affect. He was not down and depressed. I mean, he was energetic. He was engaging. 

00:45:35
JAY HALEY He was even joking once. 

00:45:35
Right, we were laughing. So I’m feeling kind of cool but that’s because I was under the vent. It’s like he said, it’s not familiar to him to feel this warmth, this happiness you know. So and I’m happy for him that he’s been able to experience that. I mean to get him back enrolling in school next semester. I mean, that’s a humongous accomplishment. 

00:45:55
Good job! 

00:45:55
JAY HALEY What you’re… What you're really doing is turning the man’s life around. With a guy like that, you worry about him improving as a temptation for the therapist and then collapsing so the therapist is disappointed. That is, there are people who do disappoint their therapist. But I don’t think he’s doing that at all. I think he’s coming out of whatever he was in. 

00:46:20
So I'm… I'm actually pretty pleased that something… 

00:46:20
JAY HALEY He might be on medication. 

00:46:20
Yeah! But medication or no medication, I mean, he is getting more and more proactive. What about the letter? Like, all right, let’s get the darn(ph) letter already. So I think it’s more the computer, not me. 

00:46:35
JAY HALEY You did very well this time. 

00:46:35
Yeah. 

00:46:35
No, thanks. A professional does the job that has to be done, no matter how they feel, right? So I just went in there and said, look, I’ve got to give this guy my best. I can’t just go in there and just kind of, you know, fake my way through it or just kind of you know. 

00:46:45
JAY HALEY You know Truman(ph) was the man who defined therapy. He said that if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. You’ve got to be able to stand it and not say it’s just too much for me or something like that. 

00:47:00
Hmm…Hmm… It maybe also that his affect(ph) was more upbeat anyway. 

00:47:00
Yeah! 

00:47:05
A Week Later 

00:47:10
He mailed it and he… his parents haven’t received it yet. It’s going to take three to ten days for them to get it. So he gave me his e-mail address. If any of you want to e-mail him back for the results of the letter, he said that he would be more than happy to e-mail them to you. I asked him this week about and said I wanted to talk about the molestation you had mentioned last time. And he told me the entire thing again, like he didn’t recall that he had told me the whole story before. He cruises out on the Internet, looks up the S&M sadomasochistic ads and things like that, and he’s always looking for submissive people who want a dominant. And we talked about fantasies he has in terms of violence and what type of violence appeals to him. And he likes the hair pulling. This is just getting really bizarre. He likes the hair pulling he likes the idea of slapping a woman once before they have sex. He got together with some… 

00:48:00
And he wonders why he doesn’t have any girls coming around? 

00:48:05
Well, but there is, I think, but he acknowledges that he… he has that compassion side to himself that that would never really follow through with that. So these are things that that stimulate him. And… But then he’s engaging in dangerous or risky behavior. He… He told me about three months ago he got together with this woman off the Internet, a bondage woman, and they had sex and totally unprotected. And one time he got together with a transvestite from the Internet and he said they had sex. He said, at first I spent a lot of time talking. He’s like counseling the guy. They were talking about this transvestite’s past and all the tragedies behind that and he said you know they had sex, but he said it was it was it was horribly said it was very sick. He said it was a sick thing that I did. You know this whole thing has taken a whole turn. I mean, talk about deviation talk about fork. I mean this is just a whole different ballgame now. He hasn’t mentioned it to anybody. So I spent a lot of time you know telling him how much I appreciated the trust. Well, I did kind of half make him promise that I would be the last therapist he would come to more or less so I guess you know. This is about nine sessions down the road or nine weeks. 

00:49:15
JAY HALEY It sounds like it is more elaborate than that. I mean it wasn’t just a trauma. He’s got a way of life involved. He will have to undo his way of life to have some goal of normal living. 

00:49:35
(inaudible ). People who are into that sometimes had never had any kind of history with it before. 

00:49:45
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:49:45
One other thing I don't know what to do with this, but he saw this, he was like somewhere with these little children, with little boys, and he said he had the urge to like just kiss one of them you know. And look at it, all the women he hangs around with are like 18, 19, 20 year olds. He’s the teacher. 

00:50:05
JAY HALEY Therapy with him and he tells you all these things. It’s impressing. It may not be one you have enthusiasm for. 

00:50:15
What do you think would be behind his impressing, you mean? 

00:50:20
JAY HALEY I think he’s unhappy with the way he is. 

00:50:20
Yeah. 

00:50:20
JAY HALEY And he got a therapist who got him to write a letter to his father. That probably brought all this out. 

00:50:25
Well, yeah, very well may have. Absolutely. Because, in part, you’re doing things with him that have never been done with him before. You’ve asked him to be his last therapist, his last therapist. You got him to write a letter to his dad, which who knows what that stirred up, but I suspect he’s seeing you differently than he’s seen other therapists. You’ve got more leverage. 

00:50:45
JAY HALEY It is better to focus on current behavior so that he does not get carried away with that trauma at 12 years old. 

00:50:55
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:50:55
But that could be the ideology-at least of the depression. I’m, I'm convinced that at this point even if he found the key to his depression, I think we all are, that’s not going to change his behavior at this point. 

00:51:05
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:51:05
I mean I'm more than aware of that. 

00:51:05
JAY HALEY And if he can remember that incident in detail then it won’t necessarily affect him and what he is doing with people now. 

00:51:15
It's different than to just sit there and get him going, I'll give you all the information and… 

00:51:20
JAY HALEY Unless you've got the information, you're still having the problem. 

00:51:25
Right. 

00:51:25
Still I'll (inaudible ). 

00:51:26
JAY HALEY I think it helps to choose one at a time, take one activity. And whatever else you must (inaudible ) but what about such and such. 

00:51:35
Hmm… 

00:51:35
JAY HALEY What about this guy who didn't have intercourse with her. If you wanted to really push something. But you just have one, one-theme interview for an hour. I think you are fortunate if you can get a case like that, a multi-problem, strange case within an ethnic group. I mean, if the guy goes to work and begins to do something that gives him some self-esteem it would be nice. I think a lot of this stuff then drops away. One thing that I think is important when you are thinking about a strategy of therapy. You can either decide that that traumatic incident in childhood caused him to do what he is doing today with a guy. Or you can say that he does this with a guy and when he wonders why he does it, he remembers that incident and it helps him explain why he has these feelings now. But it doesn’t mean it is the cause of his present behavior. It means it is an expression. 

00:52:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:35
It is a cause. Well, isn’t it? 

00:52:40
JAY HALEY (inaudible ) in the past you should (inaudible ) I think. 

00:52:50
The father was casual about the letter. The son even had to ask if he received it. A six months follow-up revealed that the client was going to college. He had left therapy after four months. 

00:53:00
JAY HALEY In this film there are a variety of therapy interventions. Among them are one or two of special interest particularly if one is doing brief therapy. An issue was dealing with a client who had had years of therapy. It was necessary for the therapist to be unpredictable and extreme in certain ways since the client was experienced with years of insightful traditional therapy. A second issue is the parallels between therapist-client relationship and therapist-supervisor relationship. If the supervisor is reflective with the therapist, the therapist will be reflective with the client. If the supervisor is firm with the therapist, the therapist can be firm with the client. In this case, the supervisor attempted again and again to persuade the therapist to arrange the letter to the father. When the therapist did what the supervisor said, the therapist was able to get the client to do the task. The letter writing was the vehicle for the action. This was why it was so important that the therapist take action. The father’s disinterested response was as important as if he became angry, since either way the client could shift his family relationships in his own behalf.
